                    question:
                    A ? robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber ! and half that much ? white ! fiber.  ; How , many bolts in total does it take?<end_of_turn>


What we know: 
* A robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
* The robe needs half as much white fiber as blue fiber.


**Step 1: Calculate the amount of white fiber needed**
* We know the robe needs half the amount of white fiber as blue fiber.
* We need to find out how many bolts of white fiber is needed.
* That is 2 bolts of blue fiber / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of bolts needed**
* We know we will need 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
* We know we will also need 1 bolt of white fiber.
* Total bolts needed = 2 + 1 = 3 bolts

Based on the information provided, Tracy could obtain **1.7** pieces of wire.

**Step 1: Convert everything to inches.**

* The original wire length is given in feet, which is 4 feet.
* We need to convert feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

**Step 2: Determine the number of inch-long pieces.**

* The wire was cut into pieces that are 6 inches long.
* We need to divide the overall wire length in inches by the length of each piece: 48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.


**Step 3:  Answer** 

* The final answer is **8** pieces.

                    : Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each rose ! bush has 25 : roses. Each . rose has 8 , thorns. How many thorns are ; there total?<end_of_turn>


Let's break it down.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses.**

* Dan plants 3 rose bushes.
* Each bush has 25 roses.
* Total roses: 3 * 25 = 75 roses

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of thorns.**

* Each rose has 8 thorns.
* Total roses: 75 roses.
* Total thorns: 75 * 8 = 600 thorns

**The final answer is: 600 thorns{ 


**
**Explanation:**
 
 We first determine the number of roses. Then, we determine the number of thorns by multiplying the number of roses by 8, as each rose has 8 thorns.** 
```
 * **Step 1:** We calculate the total roses by multiplying the number of bushes (3) by the number of roses per bush (25).
  * 3 * 25 = 75 roses

* **Step 2:** We calculate the total thorns by multiplying the total number of roses (75) by the number of thorns per rose (8).
  * 75 * 8 = 600 thorns

Let's break this problem down:

 **Step 1: Understand the Situation**

* We have a tank of water, the depth of which on Monday was given as 17 feet.
* On Tuesday, water reached a depth of 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet.
* On Wednesday, the water depth is 2/3 the depth on Tuesday.

**Step 2: Calculate the Depth on Tuesday**

* We know that on Tuesday, the water depth was 24 feet.

**Step 3: Calculate the Depth on Wednesday**

Let's break it down:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - We know there are 6 girls in the park.
   - There are twice the number of boys in the park.

2. **Set up an equation:**
   -  Let `x` represent the number of boys in the park.
   -  The number of boys is twice the number of girls, so we can write: `x = 2 * 6`.  {Note: We could simplify this further to 2 * 6 = 12}
   -  We know there are 12 boys.
   
3. **Total number of kids:**
   - `x + y = total kids`
   -  `12 + 6 = total kids`
   - `18 = total kids` {Note: This follows the fundamental rule: Total people = Boys + Girls} 

**The final answer is 18**

                    ; Brett is 14 : years old. In four years his : sister Angela will , be three ? times . as ! old , as he is now. How old is Angela right now?<end_of_turn>


## Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Define the variables:**
    * Let B represent Brett's current age.
    * Let A represent Angela's current age.

2. **Write the given information as equations:**
    * We know B = 14  (Brett is currently 14 years old)
    * In four years, Brett will be B + 4 years old.
    * In four years, Angela will be A + 4 years old. 
    * We also know in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is.
        *  A + 4 = 3 (B + 4)

3. **Substitute the values to simplify the equation:**
    * A + 4 = 3(14 + 4) 

4. **Solve the equation:**
    * A + 4 = 3(18)
    * A + 4 = 54
    * A = 54 - 4
    * A = 50

5.  **Conclusion:**
    * Angela is currently 50 years old.


{The final answer is 50.}

**Solution:**

1. **Distance per walk:** Jeff walks 1.5 miles to work each day.
2. **Walking distance for 5 days:** Since he works 5 days a week, his total walk distance is calculated by: 1.5 miles * 5 days = 7.5 miles.

                    question:
                    A , boy has ? 5 ? cards. His ! brother has ; 3 fewer cards than he has. How many cards do they , have together?<end_of_turn>


##  Breaking down the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Find the number of cards the boy has.**

* We are given this condition: ""A, boy has ... cards.""
* We do not have the exact number of cards he has, so we will represent it with the letter ""x"". 

**Step 2:  Find the number of cards the brother has.**

* We are told: "" His ! brother has ; 3 fewer cards than he has.""
* To find the number of cards the brother has, we subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has:
    *  Brother's cards =  Boy's cards - 3 
    *  Brother's cards = x - 3

**Step 3: Calculate the number of total cards.**

* We know now the number of cards for both boys. To find the total cards for both boys, we combine the amount of cards each owns:
    * Total cards = Boy's cards + Brother's cards
    * Total cards = x + (x-3)

**Step 4: Simplify the final Equation.**

* Combine the x terms together:
    * Total cards = ax + (x - 3)

**Step 4:  Combine the like terms.**

*Total cards = (1 + 1)x - 3*

**Step 5:  Complete the final  equation.**

*  Total cards =  **2x - 3**

**The final answer is:**  {The final answer is 2x - 3 }  

This final answer can be easily verified with the conditions, meaning we still have a value for how many cards each can hold.

"A plane travels ; 1200 ? miles in 3 hours. At the same rate, : how ! many additional ? hours would it ? take : to travel an additional 2000 miles?","<bos><start_of_turn>user

                    question:
                    A plane travels ; 1200 ? miles in 3 hours. At the same rate, : how ! many additional ? hours would it ? take : to travel an additional 2000 miles?<end_of_turn>
*I know the formula for this is: miles per hour = Distance / time*.


**Here's how I broke down the problem:**

1. **Define Variables:** 
   - Let 'x' represent the speed of the plane in miles per hour (mph).
   - We know the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so  x × 3 = 1200

2. **Solve for x:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation to isolate 'x':  x = 1200 / 3
   -  x = 400 mph 

3. **Calculate Time for Additional 2000 Miles:**
   - Now we know the plane travels at 400 mph.
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = 2000 miles / 400 mph
   -  Time = 5 hours

**Answer:** The final answer is {5 additional hours}

## Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the total croissants per day:**
    - Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day.
    - 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 croissants

2. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed per day:**
    - 1/4 pound of butter for each dozen
    - 48 croissants need 48 * (1/4) = 12 pounds of butter per day

3. **Calculate the total butter needed for a week:**
    - 12 pounds per day * 7 days a week = 84 pounds of butter needed per week

* Step 1: What is Prince's daily meat production?
* Step 2: How many kg of meat can Prince sell each day?
* Step 3: How many days will it take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull?

Let's analyze each step carefully.

* **Step 1: What is Prince's daily meat production?**
   * Answer: Prince produces 15 kg of meat every hour he works.
   * Since he works 10 hours a day, his daily production is 15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg. 

Thus, the production is 150 kg 

* **Step 2: How many kg of meat can Prince sell each day?**
   * He works for 10 hours and produces 150 kg of meat. 
   * Therefore, the amount of meat he can sell each day is 150 kg/day.

Thus, his daily production is 150 kg.


* **Step 3: How many days will it take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull?**
   * Bill's bull weighs 750 kg. 
   * To sell the meat, Prince needs to sell 750 kg.
   * He can produce and sell 150 kg per day.
   * To cover that demand, he needs 750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days.

This seems to be about genealogy; a tree of family members. We have a chain of relationships to figure out!

**Step 1: Define the Basics**

*  We need to figure out how many great-grandchildren Great Grandma Jones will have at the family reunion. 
  * **Let's start by breaking down the tree of family, using the information given:** Grandma Jones, children, and grandchildren 

**Step 2:  Work out the Pattern**

*  Great Grandma Jones has three ! children.  Each one of these children has three children of their own... So there is a constant pattern,  each child, each generation, etc. to work through.
* We need to figure out how many great-grand-babies she’ll have.

**Step 3: Make a Calculation**

*  Great Grandma Jones’ children will have their own children.  We have a series of generations and need to count that. 
* Think about how many grandchildren are then going to have their own children, and then their grandchildren, and so forth

**Final Answer is:**
**The final answer is  {It is tough to determine specifically the precise number of great-grand-babies that Great Grandma Jones will have at the reunion without knowing the exact number of children each of her descendants will have. However, this can easily be determined with some arithmetic of the sequence.}**


**Why is this so complicated?**


The problem assumes simple logic. When dealing with a real generational tree for any family, there are too many factors that can affect the numbers. 

* **Variation in the ages of family members:** Some descendants might have children at different ages.
* **Variations among family members:** Some people might not have children at all. 
* **Fluctuation of family members:** Some members get married and have children, adding to the generation count, while some might lose a child

{The final answer is}

**Solution:**

1. **Goal and Progress:** We know that they need to raise $6300 and have raised $2100 in 3 hours. 
2. **Rate of Fundraising:** To reach their goal, they need to raise the remaining amount:  $6300 - $2100 = $4200. 
3. **Calculating Time:** We need to know how many hours it would take to reach the goal with a fixed rate. 
4. **Finding the Rate:** In three hours, they raised $2100 and the amount raised in one hour is $2100 / 3 = $700
5. **Total Hours to Reach Goal:** Therefore, to reach their goal, it would take a total of $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

**Solution**
1. **Start with the total number of students:**
   - The class has 50 students.

2. **Find the number of students who like to bake:**
   - 10 students like to bake.

3. **Find the number of students who like to play basketball:**
   - 5 students like to play basketball.

4. **Find the number of students who like to play video games or music:**
   - We need to find this number of students.

5. **Create an equation for students who like either video games or music:**
   - Let's call the number of students who like video games or music ""V"". 
   -  The number who play video games or music will be given if we consider the relative amount of people who like to play a sport and the relative amount of people who play video games. 

6. **Find the number of students who like to play music:**
   - Music is twice the number of basketball players so, the total students like the sound of music will then be 2 * 5 = 10

7. **Establish a relationship between the number of students who like to play video games or music and basketball players:**
   - We know 5 like basketball 
   - We know music is twice the number of basketball players so that `number of basketball players = (Music Players)`.

8. **Solve the equation:**
   - We know the number of students who like video games or music is 2 * 5 =10. 

The final answer is: 15. 




**Note about the solution:**
* The provided text has some spelling and grammatical errors that need to be corrected. 
* The solution does not follow the steps in the problem properly. For example, step 6 uses the name `Music Players` that is not defined in the step 6.

*Step 1:** First, we will calculate the total number of animals Melissa needs to groom. 

*Step 2*: Next, we will determine how many animals Melissa grooms each day.  

Let's start with Step 1:

*Step 1*: First, we need to determine the total number of animals Melissa needs to groom.
*She has 8 dogs that need to be bathed , so that's 8.
*She has 5 cats that need their nails clipped, so that's 5.
*She has 3 birds that need their wings trimmed, so that's 3.
*She has 12 horses that need to be brushed, so that's 12.
*So how many animals in total?  We add the number of animals to get 8+5+3+12=28 animals.*

Step 2: We know that Melissa splits her grooming time evenly over the workdays. 

To figure this out, we can divide the number of animals she needs to groom over the total number of days she works.

*28 animals / 7 days = **4 animals per day. **

                    Joey plays football every week. ? Last , week , he played ? 2 matches ! on Monday, ; 1 match on Friday, , and on Saturday he played double the ! number ? of matches he : played on : Monday. How many matches did Joey play in . one week?<end_of_turn>
* **Note:** You can use the regular math formatting or LaTeX. 
  
  Here's how to break it down:

1. **Set up the variables:**
   * Let `m` represent the number of matches Joey played on Monday.
   * Let `f` represent the number of matches Joey played on Friday.
   * Let `s` represent the number of matches Joey played on Saturday.

2. **Write down the given information:**
   * `m + f + s = total matches` 
   * `s = 2 * m` (Saturday matches are double Monday)
   * `f = 1` (Joey played one match on Friday)
   
3. **Substitute to solve for 'm' :**
   * Now, you know `f = 1` , and we know the total matches would be the sum of matches on a single match
   * Substitute that 'f' value into the second given information we have : `s = 2 * m` to get `s = 2 * m`
   * We also know that  `m + f + s = total matches`, so  `m + 1 + s` must equal the total number of matches.

4. **Solve the system of equations:**
  * By substituting the value of `s` into the `total matches` equation above to solve for the value of 'm': 
  * `m + 1  + 2m = total matches` 
  * This must equal the total of matches which were played that week.
  * `3m + 1 = total matches`

5. **Determine the value of 'm'**:
   * `total matches = 3m + 1`
   * Therefore we know that `3m + 1 = 2`
   * Subtract 1 from both sides:  `3m =1`
   * Divide both sides by 3: `m = 1/3`

6. **Find 's'**:
   * We know from the initial information that 's' is double the number of matches that were played on Monday 
   * Therefore we know that `s = 2 * m` 
   * Substitute in `m` from step 5  to get: `s = 2 * (1 / 3)`
   * Now we know `s = 2/3`

7. **Find the total matches**:
   * Using the total matches value calculation we determined in the previous step:
   * Total matches =  `m + f + s`
   * Total matches = `1/3 + 1 + 2/3`
   * Final total matches = `1 + 1 + 2/3` 
   * Final total matches = `4/3`


{The final answer is 4/3 or 1.33}

## Step by Step Solution
    
1. **Define Variables:**
    * Let 'T' represent the number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays.
    * Let 'W' represent the number of chimichangas made on Wednesdays.
    * Let 'F' represent the number of chimichangas made on Friday. 
 
2. **Write the relationships between the variables:**
    *  We have T = 125.
    *  We have W = 125 (the same number on Tuesdays and Wednesday).
    *  We have F = 2W (twice as many chimichangas made on Friday as compared to Wednesday)

3. **Solve the equation:**
    *  We are given that F = 2W, and that W = T, meaning W = 125.
    *  We can substitute W = 125 back into the equation for F: F = 2 (125)
    *  Therefore, F = 250.

4. **Express the Final Answer:** 
      {The final answer is: 125 on Tuesdays + 125 on Wednesdays + 250 on Friday = 500 chimichangas}



Answer: 500. 


**Solution Explanation:**

* The problem asks for the total number of chimichangas produced on these three days.
* We were given the number of chimichangas made on each of Tuesdays, Wednesday and Friday.
* We can calculate the total number of chimichangas by finding the total for Tuesday, Wednesday's chimichangas and Friday chimichangas.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Define variables**

* Let  'x' represent the number of acres on Farmer Brown's farm.
* Let 'y' represent the number of acres on Farmer Smith's farm.

**Step 2:  Set up an equation based on the given information**

* We know that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. This means: x = 200
* We know that Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's acreage: y = 2(200) + 100
* Simplify the equation for Farmer Smith's acres:  y = 400 + 100
* Simplify further: y = 500 
 

{We can confirm that the value '500' as an answer is correct}



 **Step 3:  Calculate the total acreage**

* Now that we have the acreage for both farms, add them together: x + y

* The total acreage is:  200 + 500 = 700



 **Step 4: Determine the Final Answer** 

 {The total acreage of both farms is   700.}

This problem requires a step-by-step approach:


**Step 1:  Calculate the amount Adam's father gave him.**

* His father gave him twice the amount his mother gave him, so he received 2 * $6 = $12.

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Adam received.**

* Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him $12, for a total of $6 + $12 = $18.

**Step 3: Calculate the amount Adam contributed from his savings.**

* Adam received $18 from his parents but spent $30 on trousers, so the money he had to contribute from his savings is $30 - $18 = $12.


{The final answer is $12} 

**Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.**

* Explain how the first puzzle contributes to the total. 
* Explain how the second puzzle contributes to the total. 

**Detailed Solution:**

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **The first puzzle:** Teddy completed half of a 500-piece puzzle.
 * This means he completed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 
2. **The duration:** Teddy worked for an hour.
* He started the second puzzle. This means the second puzzle he would have to complete the whole puzzle in an hour.
3. **The second puzzle:** Teddy finished another 500-piece puzzle. 
* The first puzzle and the second puzzle contributed to the total number of pieces finished. *
4. **The total pieces:** We need to determine the entire amount of pieces done
* Teddy completed both puzzle he completed 250+500 = 750 pieces.
{The final answer is 750}


**Explanation of each step:**

* **Step 1** We begin by understanding that Teddy finished half of the first puzzle, therefore he has also completed 250/1 puzzles.

* https:// Khan Academy Kids (free app) https://www.khanacademy.org/students/parents



Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Define a variable:** 
   - Let 'x' represent the number of pomelos Eve gave away. 

2. **Form an equation:**
   -  Eve's pomelos after sharing = Original pomelos - Pomelos given away
   -  (20 - x) = (1/4) * 20 

3. **Simplify the equation:**
   -  20 - x = 5

4. **Solve for x:**
   -      Subtract 20 from both sides: -x = -15
   -      Multiply both sides by -1: x = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away **15** pomelos.

{The final answer is}

Solution:
Step 1: Calculate the total number of games played in four years.
Let the number of games played in a year be 'x'.
Games played in 4 years = 4 * x. 
The number of games played in four years is 4x.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of points scored.
Total points scored = (number of games played) * (points scored per game)
Total points scored = 4x * 21.
Total points scored = 84x
Therefore, the calculation for total points scored in four years can be rewritten as 84x.

Step 3: Determine the value of 'x'. 
We know that games played in a year is ? . 
So, we can write the equation : 4x = total number of games played in four years.

Step 4: Find the value of 'x'.
To obtain the value of x, let’s substitute the value we have in the question into the above equation.
4x = 4x.

Step 5: Find the total number of points scored.
Total points scored = 84x.
Total points scored = 84 * x.




{The final answer is} **84x**

Let's break down this problem step by step.

**1. Define Variables:**

   *  Let 'J' represent Jackson's age.
   *  Let 'A' represent Amy's age. 
   *  Let 'C' represent Corey's age.
   *  Let 'K' represent James' age.


**2. Set Up Equations Based on the Given Information:**

   *  ""Amy is 5 years older than Jackson"" 
      * A = J + 5 
   *  ""Amy is 2 years younger than Corey""
      * A = C - 2 
   *  ""James is 1 year younger than Corey"" 
      * K = C - 1
   *  ""James is 10 years old""
      * K=10

**3. Analyze the Given Age Data and Find the Relationship Between the Kids:**

* * Amy:  We know Amy is 1 year older than James and  2 years younger than Corey.


 
**4. Solve the System of Equations:**

  * **Combine A = J + 5 and A = C - 2:** 
     * J + 5 = C - 2
     * J = C - 7

  * **Combine K = C - 1 with K = 10:**
     * C - 1 = 10
     * C = 11

  * **Substitute the value of C from the third equation into the first and second equations for A:**
     * J = 11 - 7  
     * A = 11 - 2

  * **Therefore, we can now calculate Jackson's age:**
      * J = 4 

**The final answer is:** {Jackson is 4 years old.}

*Please note* that I have removed some text to make the problem clearer and easier to follow.{

**Here's the breakdown of the reasoning:**

1. **Initial Container Count:**  We know there were 2 containers on the first day, each with 5 vehicles.
   * This gives us 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles.

2. **Vehicles from Next Day:**  The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the next day's arrival.
   *  This means 10 + x = 30 where x is the number of additional vehicles brought in. 

3. **Solving for x:**  We can deduce the number of additional vehicles
   * Subtracting the initial load (10 vehicles) from the day's total,  we get 30-10 = 20 

 
4.**Containers on the Second Day:** If each container holds 5 vehicles, there must have been at least 20/5 vehicles
   * This confirms there must have been at least 4 containers on the second day.

5.  **Final Answer:**  The final answer is {4 containers}.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of cars:** 
   We are given that there are 20 cars available for rent.

2. **Calculate the number of semi-automatic cars:**
   * Automatic cars: 12
   * Manual cars: 4
   * Total automatic and manual cars: 12 + 4 = 16 cars
   * Semi-automatic cars: 20 - 16 = 4 cars

3. **Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:**
   * (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100%
   * (4 / 20) * 100% = 0.2 * 100% = 20%

**Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%.**

1. **Start with the initial amount:** The problem states Celine starts with 120 liters of water.
2. **Calculate water used for garden:** Celine used 90 liters from the tank for her garden. 
3. **Calculate water remaining:** After using garden water, 120 - 90 = 30 liters are left.
4. **Calculate rainwater amount:** The collected rainwater is twice the amount left, so she collects 30 * 2 = 60 liters of rainwater.
5. **Calculate the total water:** Celine used 90 water and collected 60 liters of rainwater, meaning 90 + 60 = 150 liters were used. 
6. **Calculate the water in the tank now:**  The tank started with 120 liters, and 150 liters were used, leaving  120 - 150 = -30 liters.

*The question states that Will buys 15 oranges*

*Will gets home with his 2 sons* {This is given}.
*His question is how many oranges can his sons wash*?
*We need to consider how many oranges each son washes*.

*The oldest son is 8 years old and the youngest is half his age*.
*We need to determine how old the youngest son is*.
*The youngest son is half of the oldest son's age*.
*This means the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old*.


*Using the ages of the sons:
Oldest son = 8 years old
Youngest son = 4 years old

* We know that they wash as many oranges as they are years old
* Olden son washes 8 years old x orange
* Youngest son washes 4 years old x orange.
 
*This means that the old son washes 8 * oranges.
* This means that the youngest son washes 4 * oranges*.

*It is stated that the oldest son washes 8 * oranges,
* It is stated that he gets home with 15 oranges*.


*Therefore, he will wash 8 * oranges.  

*These oranges will be washed and left in the fridge to keep all of the oranges fresh*.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Determine the duration of the yoga class:**

*  Peyton's after-work activity on Monday is a one-hour yoga class.

**2. Calculate the duration of the cooking class:**

*  Tuesday's cooking class is three times as long as Monday's yoga: 
   * Three times the length of a yoga class is 3 * 1 hour = 3 hours.

**3. Calculate the duration of the cheese-tasting:**

* The cheese-tasting event is half an hour long.

**4. Determine the duration of the museum tour:**

* The museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class on Thursday, so we need to find the length of the cooking class on Thursday
* Thursday's cooking class is three times longer than Monday's yoga: 3 hours
* Thursday's cooking class takes 1/3 of the time of Thursday's cooking class 


**5. Calculate the total duration for all activities:**
 
 *  To calculate the total time, we add the time of each activity:
* Monday’s activity: 1 hour (yoga)
* Tuesday’s Activity: 3 hours (cooking)

{We are going to need to figure out the number of pots needed for the roses and then subtract them from what April already has.}
Let's break this down:
1. **Calculate the number of rose pots:** 
   April needs twice as many rose pots as daisy pots, so she needs 30 * 2 = 60 rose pots.

2. **Calculate the total number of pots needed:**
   April needs 30 daisy pots + 60 rose pots = 90 pots

3. **Calculate the total number of pots April has:**
   April has 100 pots that she bought already.
 
4. **Calculate the number of pots left:**
   The final step is subtracting their bought pots from the needed pots 
   April has 100 - 90 = 10 flower pots left.
   
 
{ The final answer is 10 plants pots.}

* The prompt specifies that the fairies fly above the forest and not within it, and there are no other relevant constraints like the fairies' movement being limited to a particular part of the playground.



Based on this information, let's break down the problem:

**Step 1: Initial Fairy Count**

* Katelyn sees 50 fairies.

**Step 2: Addition of New Fairies**

*  One of Katelyn's friends sees half the fairies Katelyn saw: 50 / 2 = 25 fairies
*  These fairies come from the East and join the existing fairies.

**Step 3:  Fairy Count After Arrival**

* The total number of fairies at that point is 50 + 25 = 75 fairies
*  Then, 30 fairies fly away.

**Step 4: Final Fairy Count**

* The final count of fairies remaining is 75 - 30 = **45**





**The final answer is 45.**

*step 3*: 
    Total bottles he needs 
*step 4:*

*step 5*: 
    Total water bottles needed 


Let's break down the problem step by step:

* **Step 1: Bill's starting amount of water**  
    Bill started with 2 cases of water, which each have 24 bottles. So his starting amount is:
    * 2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles 

* **Step 2:  Number of guests**
    He has 70 guests, arriving for the party.

* **Step 3: Total bottles he needs**
    Bill wants 2 bottles of water per guest, and he has 70 guests:
    * 70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

* **Step 4: Water bottle needed **
    He needs 140 bottles since he has these guests.
    

* **Step 5: Total water bottles needed** 
    His initial 48 bottles + 140 bottles for the guests adds up to:

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step:

* **Step 1: Define variables:**
    * Let Shiloh's nephew's current age be ""n"" 
* **Step 2: Translate the given information into equations:**
    * ""In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew""  can be written as:  Shiloh's age in 7 years + 7 = 3(n's age in 7 years)
    * Since we know Shiloh's age in 7 years will be the sum of his age in 7 years and 7 (because of the context) and we know his age in 7 years, we can rewrite the equation  as: Shiloh's age in 7 years + 7 = 3(n's age in 7 years)
* **Step 3: Simplify the equations based on the information provided!:**
    * We know Shiloh is currently 44 years old and his age in 7 years is (44+7)
* **Step 4:  Solve for Shiloh's age in 7 years:**
    * Shiloh's age in 7 years = 44 + 7 = 51.
* **Step 5: Solve for the age of Shiloh's nephew in 7 years:**
    * We know Shiloh's age in seven years will be 51 and we know his age in 7 years is three times his nephew's age in 7 years.  This can be translated as:
* **Final Step: Solve for Shiloh's nephew's age today:**
   * We know that Shiloh and his nephew's ages in 7 years will each account for 3(Shiloh's age in 7 years) and 3(age of Shiloh's nephew in 7 years) respectively.
    * Since we know that Shiloh's age in 7 years is 51 and his age in 7 years will be the sum of his age in 2018 and 7 (because of the context) we can write that : his age in 2018 = 51 - 7 = 44

Max bought 16 snowflake : stamps. He . bought ! 3 more truck stamps ; than snowflake stamps, ? and 9 fewer rose stamps . than truck : stamps. ? How many stamps did Max buy in all?<end_of_turn>


**Let's break it down:**

1. **Define variables:** 
   -  Let 'x' represent the number of truck stamps.
   -  Let 'y' represent the number of rose stamps.
   -  Let 's' represent the number of stamps in total. 

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**

   - We know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps:  x = 16 (This tells us Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.  We can set the snowflake stamp quantity against the variables in step 1)
   - He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps: x = 16 + 3
   - He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps: y = x - 9 
   

   Finally, we can set this up with an equation for the total number of stamps (s):  
   s = x + y + s 


3.  **Solve for the number of stamps:**

   - Since we have an equation that contains number of truck stamps (x), snowflake stamps (y), and total stamps (s) we can simplify it.
   - s = 16 + (16 + 3) + (16 - 9)

   -  Simplify:
    s = 16 + 19 + 7
    s = 42

The final answer is {Max bought 42 stamps in all.}

*  **Step 1:**  Calculate Bennet's initial earnings from the eggplants.
*  **Step 2:** Calculate how much money Bennet needs to make from the corn.
*  **Step 3:** Calculate the price per ear of corn needed to reach the target earnings.

Let's break it down step by step:

* **Step 1:** How much money did Bennet make from the eggsplants?
    * Bennet sold 20 eggplants * $3/plant = $60. So 
* **Step 2:** How much money does Bennet need to make from the corn?
    * Bennet needs to make a total of $135.
    * He already earned $60 from the eggplants. 
    * We need to make $135 - $60 = $75 from the corn. 
* **Step 3:** How much per ear of corn does he need to sell?
     * Bennet needs  $75 from the corn sales.
     * He has 25 ears of corn.
    * Therefore, he'd have to sell each ear for $75 / 25 = $3/ear.

Let's break it down step by step:

**1.  Determine the temperature difference and desired heating:**

*   The temperature difference between day and night is 45° - 33° = 12°F
*   The desired heating to prevent pipes from freezing is 32°F (given). 

**2. Calculate the required heating increase:**

*   Since the house cools down by 12°F, he needs to heat it by an additional 32°F to the temperature. 
*   This means the heating he'd need to do is 32°F. 

**3. Find out how much it's heated by a log of wood after burning it:**

*   Burning a log of wood brings the temperature of the house up by 5°F
*  


 **4. Calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn:**

*  32° (desired increase) / 5° degree increase/log = 6.4   
*   Since Carson can't burn fraction of logs, he would need to burn **7** logs to prevent freezing.

**Final Answer is:** Carson needs to burn 7 logs.

* **Solution**

* **1. Identify the key question and set up a problem. **
 What information do we want to find? The difference in distance between the two cars after 2hr.

We're given:
* Speeds of each car
* Time they're traveling 

**The problem requires us to calculate the distance traveled.** 

* **2. Define variables.** 
* Let **x** represent the distance between the two cars after 2 hours
* Let **t** represent the time for the second car to pass the first car

* ** 3.  Clarify and rewrite. 
We need to consider both the distance the first car covered and the distance the second car covered to calculate the distance between them. 


* **4. Use the formula to find out how far the first car traveled.**

Car 1 is moving at a constant speed of 60 mph.

* **5. Then calculate the total distance traveled by the second car in two hours.**

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the key information:**
    * Kimberly bought 8 cat food packages and 6 dog food packages.
    * Each cat food package contained 11 tins and each dog food package contained 6 tins.
   
2. **Calculate the number of tins of cat food:**
    * Total cat food tins = 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins

3. ** Calculate the number of tins of dog food:**
    * Total dog food tins = 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

4. ** Find the difference in tins:**
   * Difference = Total cat food tins - Total dog food tins = 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins


 **The final answer is:** 52 more tins of cat food than dog food did Kimberly buy.

And Saskay , can lift a : mountain 12 : times higher than Pompei ! can.  If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, : how high can Naruto lift a mountain, in feet?<end_of_turn>
*We can solve this problem by understanding the problem step-by-step:*

1. **Start with the facts:**
   * Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, and Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompeii.
   * We need to find Naruto's lifting ability in feet. 

2. **We know Pompeii's lifting ability:** 
   * Pompeii can lift a mountain 1 inch high, so we know that 1 inch = 1 * foot
   
3**Understanding the pattern:**
   * We can use the information about the mountain heights and the lifting ratio to calculate Naruto's ability in feet. 
   
4. **Working backwards:**
   * Given that Pompei can lift 1 foot high, we can determine the actual mountain height that Naruto can lift by determining these ratios with respect to height. 


*Now, let's work through each calculation:*

   * **Pompeii's lifting ability relative to Kagiyami:** Since Pompeii can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Kagiyami, it means that one foot is equivalent to 12 times higher mountain height (because it's like this relationship of lifting heights). 
   * **From Pompeii to Saskay:** Then, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompeii, making him able to lift the mountain 12 * 12 = 144 feet high in order for it to be 12 times higher than the previous value. 
   * **From Saskay to Kagiyami:** Then Kagiyami can lift the mountain 4 times higher than Saskay,  meaning that his high can be 4 * 144 = 576 feet. 



**Answer: {Naruto can lift a mountain 576 feet high}

If Isaias has . 300 chickens ? on ! his farm and plans ? to sell 3/5 , of them, for how ? much money did Isaias buy the . chicken ; he took . to ? the market . for ! sale?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:**
   - Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of his chickens.
   - (3/5) * 300 chickens = 180 chickens

2. **Calculate the total earnings from selling the chickens:**
   - Each chicken sells for $50
   - 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

3. **Calculate the cost per chicken:**
   - Since Isaias has to earn $2000 profit to make a profit of $2000, let's call the original price of the chicken as ""c"". 
   - The profit gained by selling these chickens as ""p"" is equal to the value that he sold the chickens of ""180*.c"",  
   - Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 on the price that he spent on these chickens.
   - p = 180*c
   - 180 * c = 2000 
   - c = $2000 / 180 = $11.11

4. **Final answer:**  
    The final answer is $11.11 .

**Explanation:**

The solution follows a logical order from step 1, to step 2, steps 3, and step 4 to address each aspect of the problem. We begin by finding out how many chickens he is selling.  Then,  we calculate his total earnings based on the price he's asking for each chicken. We calculate the cost associated with each chicken.

*Note: I am just assuming these people are rowing in a lake, that the lake's distance is measurable, and that Dijana rows for the whole time.*

**Here's my attempt**:

**Step 1: Find how far Anis rowed.** 
Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, who rowed 50 miles. So Anis rowed (1/5) * 50 miles which equals 10 miles extra. 
This means Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles. 

**Step 2: Calculate the total distance.**
To find the total distance, we need to add the distances they each rowed.  So the total distance is 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles.

**The Answer**: {The final answer is 110 miles.}

Here is the broken down solution to figure out the rest of the problem:

1. **Define Variables** 
   - Let 'r' represent the number of red balloons in the bundle, 
   - Let 'y' represent the number of yellow balloons in the bundle.


2. **Set Up Equations based on the Given Information**
   -  We know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, and a standard set is 2* for red + 3* for yellow.
     - 2r + 3y = 58
     - We also know that the bundle has 20 red and y * number of yellow.
     - 20 + y = -number of red balloons  


3. **Solve for 'r' (The Number of Red Balloons)**
   - To solve for 'r' (the number of red balloons), we need to use the information about the remaining balloons and the red and yellow.
   - We got 20r + y = 200


4.  **Solve for 'y' (The Number of Yellow Balloons)**
    - Solving for 'y' we have to use the numbers given in the statement to solve for 'y'  (the number of yellow balloons).
    - We got 20r + y = 200 



**Answer:**

{The final answer is ...}

*We can think of this problem as finding the number of bottles needed (the answer to this question)  given these inputs:*

* Pamela applies 1/2 ounce of sunscreen every hour outdoors. 
* Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles.
* She will be outside 4 hours a day over 8 days. 
* Her sunscreen is $X

* This problem is a mixture of the classic ""proportional relationship"" problem and a quantity problems because of the repeating unit measurement of the quantity of sunscreen we are given (ounces).


Let's break down the solution:

**Step 1: Calculate daily sunscreen use.** 

* Pamela applies 1/2 ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside.
* She'll be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days.
* Total daily sunscreen use: 4 hours/day * 0.5 oz/hour = 2 ounces/day
* Total sunscreen use over 8 days is: 2 ounces/day * 8 days = 16 ounces

**Step 2: Solve for the number of 8-ounce bottles.**

* Pamela needs 16 ounces of sunscreen.
*  Each bottle is 8 ounces. 
*  Number of bottles needed: 16 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 2 bottles

*Step 1*. Explain why mechanical failures are not the only possible cause of trucks not delivering goods.


*Step 2*. Explain how to calculate the number of trucks that actually made it to the farmers.


*Step 3*. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser delivered.

**Answer:**  

{The final answer is} 


**Solution:**

*Step 1*. **Why mechanical failures are not the only possible cause of trucks not delivering goods.**

When something goes wrong, like mechanical failure, with the trucks and delivery doesn't happen, we can think about other likely causes for why they didn't deliver.  Here are some additional possibilities:

* **Unexpected Weather:** Rain, snow, or strong winds can affect the road condition, making it challenging for the trucks to drive safely.
* **Road Construction:** Construction or road repairs on the route could mean detours or road blockage, delaying delivery.
* **Traffic Congestion:** Heavy traffic or accidents can hinder the routes and delivery timelines.
* **Delayed Deliveries:** Delays can occur from the company or other businesses that deliver the fertilisers themselves.


*Step 2*. **How to calculate the number of trucks that actually made it to the farmers.**

This method is based on the problem given. Here's how to solve it:

1.  **Find the original number of trucks:** Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks.
2.  **Calculate the number of trucks that were unavailable:** A quarter of the trucks (20 trucks / 4 = 5 trucks) were unable to deliver because they had mechanical failures. This number was given.

3 **Apply the information:**  The remaining number of trucks that could deliver =  20 - 5 


*Step 3*. **The calculation of the total number of tons delivered.**

Let's think of the problem in a clear way to explain how we calculate the answer.

1.  **Trucks left:** Total number of trucks left were 20 - 5 = 15 truck.
2. **Fertilizer delivered:** Each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser. These were 15 trucks 
   * 15  truck x 20 tons per truck= 300 tons

* **Total Tons Delivered:**  The amount of fertilizer delivered was 300 tons.

If his . home is 4 miles from the store : and he walks ! 4 miles per hour ! how : long ! did it take . him to reach the . store?<end_of_turn>


**Here's why we need to break this down:**

* **Question Comprehension:** Understand what the problem states. It's important to identify the main parts: the distance, his speed, and what the walk is like (starting/stopping/retuning). 

* **Step-by-Step Solutions:**  Work through each portion so we can get to an answer.


**Let's solve it step by step:**

1. **Distance:** 
   * The problem states that the store is 4 miles from James' home. 
2. **Speed:** 
   *  James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
3. **Time:**
    *  We need to determine the time it takes him to travel the 4-mile trip to the store. The key to figuring out time is to use the formula:
        * Speed = distance / time.  
         
4. **Solution Calculation:**
    *  To calculate time, rearrange the speed formula to solve for time: 
     * Time = distance / speed. 
    *  Plug in the known values: 
         * Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
    *  The final answer is: 1 hour.

**Therefore, the final answer is {It took him 1 hour to reach the store}**

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Find the weight of Elijah's dog:**

*  Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog.
* Kory's dog is 60 pounds. 
* One-fourth of 60 pounds is (1/4) * 60 = 15 pounds. 
*  Therefore, Elijah's first dog weighs 15 pounds.

**2. Find the weight of Elijah's second dog:**

* Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog.
* Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.
* Half of 60 pounds is (1/2) * 60 = 30 pounds.
* Therefore, Elijah's second dog weighs 30 pounds.

**3. Find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:**

*  Elijah has two dogs.
* The first dog weighs 15 pounds and the second dog weighs 30 pounds.
*  The total weight of Elijah's dogs is 15 + 30 = 45 pounds. 

**4. Find the weight of Kory's dogs:**

*  Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.


**5. Find the total weight of Kory's dogs:**

* We already know Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
*  {The answer is 60 pounds}.

**6. Find the total weight of both dogs:  **

* We calculated the weight of Elijah's dogs as 45 pounds.
* We know the weight of Kory's dogs as 60 pounds.
*  Total weight = 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

**{The final answer is 105 pounds.}**

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate carrots eaten on weekdays:**
   * Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays.
   * Total carrots eaten on weekdays: 4 carrots/day * 5 days/week = 20 carrots 

2. **Calculate carrots eaten on Saturdays and Sundays:**
   * Mason eats 5 carrots each day on Saturday and Sunday.
   * Total carrots eaten on weekends: 5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

3. **Calculate total carrots eaten per week:**
   *  Total carrots eaten on weekdays: 20 carrots
   *  Total carrots eaten on weekends: 10 carrots
   *  Total carrots eaten: 20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots 

**Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week. {The final answer is 30.}**

**Here's how we solve it step-by-step:**

1. **Doxa's Slice:** 
    - Doxa started with 8 slices and ate one. 
    - We must subtract her slice from the original amount to get the number of slices left: 8 - 1 = 7 slices.

2. **Sister's Slice:**
    - Doxa's sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa. 
    - So, her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.

3. **Brother's Slice:**
    - Doxa's brother ate 1 more slice than his sister.
    - His brother ate 1 + 2 = 3 slices

4. **All Together:**
   - To check the whole picture, let's add up their slices: 7 + 2 + 3 = 12 slices.

                    ? John arm wrestles : 20 people. ,  He beats 80%.  How , many people ; did he lose to?<end_of_turn>
    
    Here is the step-by-step solution
    
    1.  Calculate the number of people John beat.  
        
            * 20 people beat 80% of them, meaning he won 80% of a contest
      We can use the following logic
         * 80% of 20 = (80/100)*20 = 16  people 
         * So he beat 16 people. 
    2.  Calculate the number of people John lost to. 

            * The number we are trying to find is the count of people he lost to.   
            * Subtract the number of people he beat from the initial number of people he had to arm wrestle. This is the final step in our calculation. 
            * 20 - 16 = 4 people

{The final answer is:  4 people} 
     
     

**Discussion**

Excellent job solving the problem! Your approach is clear, understandable, and logically sound. 

I especially commend you on:

* **Identifying the relevant percentage:** You accurately determined that 80% represented those he beat, which made the problem easier to solve.
* **Using a formula for calculating probabilities:** You wisely applied the formula (80/100 * 20) directly.
* **Logical Deduction:** You meticulously completed a final calculation to find the number of people lost to.

**Solution:**

a) Calculate the increase in her bank account balance.
    *  We know her bank balance went from $200 to $420.
    * This indicates a gain of $420 - $200 = $220. 

b) Determine the total amount of wages received 
    * Since she received $220 in her bank account, that's her wage without the withheld taxes or other deductions.
    * There's $420 (final balance), minus her current bank ( $220) balance.

2. **Calculate the total time of berry-picking:** We know about the trip down, for each trip, berries are picked. 4 hours.

3. **Determine the number of times the sloth picks berries each trip down:** 
    * We need to cover 24 berries in 8 hours.
    * We start with 66 minutes per hour. This is the time the sloth spends on the trip to make a berry. 
    * There are 66 minutes per hour: 8 hours * 66 minutes/hour = 528 minutes per trip. 
    * 528 minutes / 4 hours = 132 minutes per hour 

4. **Calculate the number of trips necessary to get 24 berries:**  
    * The sloth collects one berry from each trip. 24 berries / 1 berry/trip = 24 trips needed. 


**Final answer: {The total number of berries the sloth needs to travel to and from is 24}**

The ? average ; car can go 120 Miles ? per ? hour. How fast : does , the ; faster car go?<end_of_turn>


Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Identify the key information:**

* **Average car speed:** 120 MPH
* **Speed of the ""2nd fastest car""**: 5 times faster than the average car, so 5 * 120 MPH = 600 MPH.
* **Fastest car speed:** 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.

**2. Calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**

* We know the average car speed is 120 MPH,
* We know the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
* So, the 2nd fastest car speed is 5 * 120 MPH = 600 MPH

**3. Calculate the speed of the faster car:**

* The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, which is 600 MPH.
* This means the faster car speed is 1.25 * 600 MPH = 750 MPH.


**Answer:** The faster car goes 750 MPH.

Let's break it down step by step:

**1. Charleston sheep:**

* We know Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
* Seattle has 20 sheep.
* Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

**2. Toulouse sheep:**

* Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
* Charleston has 80 sheep.
* Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

**3. Together:**

* We need to find the total number of sheep for all three cities: Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle.
* Total sheep = Toulouse sheep + Charleston sheep + Seattle sheep
* Total sheep = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 sheep

Based on the information given, here's the step-by-step reasoning:

* **Problem Statement:** We need to calculate how many tomatoes were used by Freda.
  
* **We can calculate the number of cans of tomato used:**
    * Freda's sauce was 32 ounces.
    * Each can has 16 ounces.
    * We have enough information to solve for the number of cans used.
   
* **Solve for the number of cans:**
    * 32 ounces sauce / 16 ounces per can = 2 cans
   
* **Solve for the number of tomatoes:**
    * Freda uses 2 cans of tomatoes. Each can has 3 tomatoes.
    * 2 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 6 tomatoes.
 

**The final answer is: 6 tomatoes. **

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the initial number of elves:**  
   Nissa begins with 60 elves.
   {The initial number of elves is 60}

   
2. **Calculate the number of elves who quit after children vomit on them:** 
   A third of the elves quit after being covered in vomit! Calculate that:
   (1/3) * 60 = 20 elves quit
   
3. **Calculate the number of elves remaining after the first batch quit:** 
   Nissa started with 60 elves and 20 quit, leaving:
   60 - 20 = 40 elves 

4.  **Calculate the number of elves who quit after kids kick their shins.** 
   Another 10 elves leave.

$$

## Let's break down the problem:

**1.  Original Price:**

*  Heather's razors cost $4.00 per pack.

**2.  Sale Price:**

* The offer is ""Buy one get one free"", meaning she gets two for the price of one.
* This means she'll pay for $4.00 / 2 = $2.00 for each pack.

**3.  Tax & Additional Costs**

* We're not taxed as such. The 2 discount razors will be on sale at a given price.


**4.  Total Cost:**

* Initial cost per pack: $4.00 (before the sale) 
* Cost per pack with the discount is $2.00 
* Let's consider what quantity she gets


**5.  Finding the cost per razor:**

* We initially have $4.00 but this will change depending on the quantity (2)
* Price: $2.00 per pack ($4.00 / 2 = $2.00)
* Cost per razor is $2.00 / pack

If Rose bought 12 ; onions . and 4 , potatoes, how many onions ; and . potatoes in total did Sophia ? buy . at the ! market?<end_of_turn>
*Here is the question itself!*

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - We know Rose got 12 onions and 4 potatoes.
2. **Find Rose's Onion & Potato count:**
   * We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.
   - We also know that Rose bought 12 onions. 
   
3. **Solve for Sophia's Onion & Potato Count:**
   - We can use that information to find how many onions Sophia bought. 

      **Step 4:  Finding the number of onions Sophia bought**
      * We know Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.
      * Rose's onions were 12. To find which amount Sophia's onions were, we need to work backward. 12 onions represents 12 / 4 = 3 times the amount of Sophia's onions. 
 
      **Step 5:  Finding the total number of potatoes Sophia bought**
         * We can work backward from that logic. 4 potatoes represent 12 onion, and Sophia bought 3 times the amount of Sophia's onions. So Sophia bought 12*3 = 36 potatoes.


 **Final answer is: Sophia bought 3 onions and 36 potatoes at the market. **

                    A , cat eats nine sausages in 30 ! minutes. A dog can ! eat the same number ? of sausages in ? 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes. Calculate ? the . average time : the two , take : the : eat the sausages.<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

* **Step 1: Understand the problem:** We have two animals, a cat and a dog. The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats half the number of sausages in 2/3 the time the cat takes. We need to find the average time taken by both animals to eat the sausages.
* **Step 2: Let's use variables:** Let 't' be the time the cat takes to eat 9 sausages, and 'd' be the time the dog takes to eat the same number of sausages. 
* **Step 3: The cat's eating rate:** The cat eats 9 sausages in 't' minutes, so the rate of eating (amount of food per minute) for the cat is 9/t. 
* **Step 4: The dog's eating rate:** We are told the dog eats 2/3 of the time t the cat takes, so the dog's time is 3/2 * t.
* **Step 5: Using the dog's time:**  For the dog to eat 9 sausages in the time 3/2 * t, the rate of eating for the dog is 9/(3/2 * t) = 6/t
* **Step 6: Set up the equation:** We know the dog's rate of eating is 6/t, while the cat's rate is 9/t. We also know that both animals eat 9 sausages. Let's relate the rates and times and solve for 't'
* **Step 7: Equate rates:**  Since the rate of eating is constant, we can use the given information directly to represent it in this step: 9/t = 6/(3/2 * t) 
* **Step 8: Simplify the equation:** 9/t = 6/(3/2 * t) => 9/t = 4/t     
* **Step 9: Solve for 't':**  Multiply the numerator and denominator by t on both sides: 9 * (3/2 * t) / t = 4 
* **Step 10: Simplify and solve:** 9 * (3/2) / t = 4  => 27/2t = 4
* **Step 11: Solve for 't'** Multiply both sides by t to get t: t = 27/4
* **Step 12: Find the average time:**  Since the cat took t = 27/4 minutes and the dog takes 3/2 * t = 3/2 * 27/4 = 81 / 8 minutes. 
We know the average time is t+d. {1.875 minutes*}
 




{The final answer is 1.875 minutes.}

* The question is about a relationship between the number of notebooks Martha has and notebooks Joseph has in terms of a function.

Let's assume we know:

- **Martha** has a quantity of **x** notebooks.
- **Joseph** has **y** notebooks.

Here's a breakdown to understand the problem:

1. **Martha's Notebooks:** We know Martha has x notebooks and then buys 5 more to reach 7. 

Let's clarify this: Martha starts with x notebooks. We don't know how many but we can work this out from our question. That's why we will use our assumption later.

2. **Joseph's Notebooks:** We know Joseph has y notebooks and that he had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. We have to find out what that means from Joseph's current state and Martha's state. Let’s go through that. 

3. **Finding the relationship:** We want to solve for how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph. The main challenge is determining the relationship between the number of notebooks Martha has (x) and the number of notebooks Joseph has (y) and figuring out how that relationship changed.



**Further Reasoning**
The problem doesn't give any specific numbers for Martha's initial amount of notebooks as a starting figure from which to work. We know Martha needs more to get to a total of 7, but that's only relative to Joe. We need more information.

* Average lollipops sold: 10
* Cost of lollipops : $0.50
* Number of lollipops bought: ? 

**Questions:**

*  How much money did the class raise profit from the sale of lollipops?

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the number of lollipops each student sold:**  We know each student sold an average of 10 lollipops (that they bought at $0.50 each). 

2. **Calculate the total profit per student:**  
    - Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.80, so his total profit from selling is  10 x $0.80 = $8.00. 
    
3. ** Calculate the revenue each student made:** 
   * We know each student sold 10 lollipops for $0.80, so they made total revenue from selling 10 x $0.80 = $8.00. 

4. **Calculate the total revenue from all the students:**
   - We know 30 students sold lollipops, so we get this calculation 30 x $8.00 = $240.00.  

{The final answer is} $240.00. 

**Therefore, the class was able to raise $240.00 from the sale of lollipops.**

Let's break down this problem step by step:

**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

* We have a fierce dragon in a fantasy setting!
* Perg only lets a limited fire reach from atop Mount Farbo and he stands a threat to anyone in his radius.
* We can find a solution to a problem - how far Polly can stand from the dragon to still hit it. 
* We can use the throwing ability of Polly, she is able to throw the javelin a certain range.


**Step 2: Identify Key Information**

* **Dragon's Throwable Skill:** Perg's Flames  reach 1000 ft. 
* **Polly's Javelin Throw:** Polly can throw the javelin 400 ft,
* **Gemstone Power Boost:**  holding the sapphire gem extends the throw distance. 
* **Unknown:** We need to determine how far outside of the dragon, with the gemstone, can Polly still hit it.


**Step 3:  Analyzing What We Know** 


* We know the starting distance to know where to start for Polly.
* The dragon's flame's reach only affects the player's starting area. It isn't the area where Polly needs to hit the dragon.

**Step 4: Plan the Solution**

* **Determine range with and without the gem.**
* **Find the distance with the gem that's within the range to the dragon.** 


**Step 5:  Solve the Problem**

1. **Analyze without the Gemstone:** We must begin by calculating how far she throws with no gem in hand. The javelin can reach 400 ft.

2. **Analyze with the Gemstone:** When holding the gemstone, the range increases by three times. 
   * What the 400 ft throw needs to be is multiplied to get the range.

3.  The distance Polly can stand to still hit the dragon is .

**Final Answer:**  {400 ft}

Here's my attempt at solving the problem: 

1. **Identify the given information:**
    *  Travel time by bus: 6 days.
    *  Travel time by car (from Rochester to New Jersey) is half that of the bus trip, so it takes 6 days/2 = 3 days. 
2. **Determine the travel time for the bus trip:** 
    * The problem states he's planning to go to Rochester by bus and return from there by car.  
3. **Calculate the total time:** 
     * Round up or down the bus trip time to find the total amount of travel.

**Final Answer:** 
 {The final answer is 12 days} 

**Error Analysis:** I used wrong calculations 
 
**Corrected Answer:**
1. **Identify the given information:**
   *  Travel time by bus: 6 days.
   *  Travel time by car (from Rochester to New Jersey) is half that of the bus trip, so it takes 6 days/2 = 3 days. 
2. **Determine the travel time for the bus trip:** 
   *  Andrew will make a round trip by bus from NJ to Rochester.  
3. **Calculate the total time:**
  *  He's going to Rochester by bus and returning to NJ from Rochester by Car. To travel from NJ to Rochester  by bus, it'd take 6 days.  To return to NJ from Rochester, it'd take 3 days.  
 * The total time is 6+3= 9 days

How ; old : was Bill . when ; he , saw the Comet for the first : time?<end_of_turn>


Let’s break down this problem step by step.

**1.  Understanding the Problem**

*   We need to find the age Bill was when he saw the comet the first time. 
*   We know the comet orbits every 75 years.
*   This means there's a way to figure out how many times the comet goes past earth in a single year. 

* 

**2.  Identifying Key Information**

*   Comet Halley orbits; every 75 years
*   Bill’s dad saw it when he was 30 years old.
*   Bill saw it a second time when he was three times . the age his father was when he saw the first comet. 

**3.  Making a Time-Line**

*  To make it clear how the comet orbit worked, we can make a timeline for both events. 
    *   Dad saw the comet at age 30. Let’s say this is year 1.
    *   Bill saw the comet at a second time 
*   We can use the comet information to figure out the age Bill was at each point.


** 4.  Drawing a Diagram (Optional):**

 *  A simple diagram to describe the data


** 5.  Solving the Problem
   
    
**4a.  The Comet Orbit**
 We need to determine how many times Halley orbites Earth in 75 years, to determine the number of time Halley orbits Earth in Bill's lifetime.

The second needs : to walk 4 : miles. ; The ; third needs to , walk 3 : miles. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. How . many miles does ! the last dog need?<end_of_turn>
* The total number of dogs:  4
* The total miles the three first dogs need: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8
* Average distance walked per day: 3 miles
* What is needed: to figure out the distance a fourth dog needs to walk 
{The last dog needs to walk **5** miles  to average 3 each day.}


Answer Breakdown:

1. We know that there are 4 dogs in total (4!). 
2. The first three dogs need an average of 8 miles of exercise.  
3. We are asked to find the distance the last dog needs to walk.
4. The total distance the first three dogs need is 8 miles 
5. The average daily walking of the first three dogs is 8 / 3 = 2.67 miles
 

**The problem could be solved by this approach also**:

*  It is more logical to work backwards to find the required amount of Miles per dog.

1. The dogs need an average of 3 miles per day. 
2. 8 miles, the total amount a three dogs need of exercise, is equal to 8 - 3 = 5
3. Total distance the first three dogs walk per day: 8 / 3 = 2.67 miles

* **Step 1: Determine the number of marbles Paul had before his friend gave him any.** 
  * The starting point is the total number of marbles Paul had before his friend gave him any. 
  * So, Paul had 52 marbles.
  
* **Step 2: Calculate the total number of marbles he had after his friend gave him.**
  * After his friend gave him 28 marbles, Paul had 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

* **Step 3: Determine how many marbles Paul lost in total.**
  * Paul lost 1/4 of his marbles, which means he lost 80 / 4 = 20 marbles. 

* **Step 4: Calculate the remaining number of marbles Paul has after losing some.**
  * Paul has 80 - 20 = 60 marbles left.

* **Step 5: Answer the remaining question in the question, ""how many marbles does Paul have left?""**
  * The final answer is 60 marbles.

*The *

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the number of microphones that won't fit:**
   * 20% of 50 microphones = (20/100) * 50 = 10 microphones

2. **Calculate the number of microphones that will fit:**
   * 50 microphones - 10 microphones = 40 microphones

3. **Calculate the number of pairs that fit:**
   * 40 microphones / 2 microphones per pair = 20 pairs

**The final answer is: 20 pairs**

**Reasoning**

* We calculate the number of microphones that cannot fit within the space by first figuring out how much of the microphones it's a percentage and then multiplying it by the total number of microphones 
* We then calculate the number of microphones that can fit after removing the unchangeable ones, knowing that microphones must be in pairs
*  The answer to the question is the entire number of pairs that were able to fit.

If Peter and , Martha have totals ? of 64 and 56 chocolate , bars ; respectively, : how , many . more , chocolate bars does Peter have , in each box ? than Martha?<end_of_turn>


To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

**Step 1: Define Variables**

* Let 'x' be the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter.
* Let 'y' be the number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha.

**Step 2: Formulate Equations**

* We know Peter has 4 boxes with 'x' bars in each: 4*x = total chocolate bars for Peter
* We know Martha has 7 boxes with 'y' bars in each: 7*y = total chocolate bars for Martha
* We know a combined total of 64 chocolate bars for Peter and 56 chocolate bars for Martha: 64 + 56 = 120 chocolate bars 

**Step 3: Solve the Equations**

* We can rewrite the first equation: 4*x = total chocolate bars for Peter
* We can rewrite the second equation: 7*y = total chocolate bars for Martha
* We know the combined total of 120 chocolate bars from Peter and Martha: 4*x + 7*y = 120

**Step 4: Find the Difference**

* We need to know the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha. We can use the equation:  Total chocolates by Peter - Total chocolates by Martha = Difference
*  Here, we know 120 chocolate bars were divided between Peter and Martha.

*   **Step 2:** How many packs did Anne keep?
*   **Step 3:** How many packs did Anne give to her friends?
*   **Step 4:** How many sweets did each of her friends get?


Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1:** How many pieces of sweets are there in total?

*   Answer: 15 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces of sweets.

**Step 2:** How many packs did Anne keep?

*   Answer: Anne kept 2 packs.

**Step 3:** How many packs did Anne give to her friends?

*  Answer: 15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs. 

**Step 4:** How many sweets did each of her friends get? 

* Answer We shared an equal amount of sweets: 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend. 
* Answer: 60 pieces / pack * 1.3 packs/friend = 78 pieces per friend. 


{The final answer is 78 pieces} 





**Question Clarification:** 
It's helpful to point out that the last response focuses on the final number of pieces (78) rather than the distribution of these pieces.  Since the problem states they were given to 10 friends, we should understand that each friend would receive 78 pieces/friend.

*  The problem has a lot of commas so you might need to break it into stages*

**Stage 1:**

* **Identify the relevant information**:  The problem describes a series of events happening at a restaurant. We need to keep track of:
   - The number of people entering at different times
   - The time periods 
* **Write down known values**:
   - ""On a particular day, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning"". This is our initial event
* **Formulate unknowns**:
   - What was the number that entered at 10:00 and the additional people that entered in the afternoon and at night.


Let's break it down further, by using stage 1, we can clarify these unknown quantities:






{The first step is to isolate the events and calculate the unknown quantity} 

* **Stage 2:**
* **Formulate equation**: 
   - We need to find a specific pattern in the information to work out the initial and secondary entry quantities in the day.
* **Solve for unknowns**:
   - We need to determine the numbers that entered at the different times by using the information about the people that entered at 10:00. 



Let's begin by finding the total number for each part in this stage by isolating the different individuals who entered. 
  
  



**Stage 3:**
* **Calculate the Total**:
   - We can apply a pattern to deduce the total for each time and addition 
   - Total amount of people that entered in the morning 
         * 50 
   - Total amount of people that entered at 10:00

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Understanding the Problem:**
   - A fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for a certain amount. 
   - He sold all of them, realizing a profit of 25% 
   - We need to find out the selling price (or cost per watermelon).

* **Understanding Profit:**
   - Profit means the vendor's earnings above the original cost.
   - We can calculate profit as a percentage by calculating the profit and dividing it by the original cost. 


**Step-by-Step Solution**

1. **Calculate the profit amount:**  
   -  25% of $80 = (25/100) * $80 = $20
   
2. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon:**
    - Total cost paid = $80 (given)
    - Profit = $20
    - We know the price for each watermelon. Let's call this cost 'x'
    - Total cost + profit = Selling cost per watermelon 
    - $80 + $20 = x
     
3. **Solve for the individual watermelons cost:**
    - $100 = x 

**Final Answer:** The selling price per watermelon was $100.

If he continues : to , increase his , typing speed once more by 5 ; words, what will be , the average of the three measurements?<end_of_turn>


Let's break down the solution step by step:

1. **Initial typing speed:**
   - Jared's initial typing speed is given as 47 WPM.

2. **Improvement in speed:**
   - After some practice, his speed increases to 52 WPM.

3. **Additional boost:**
   - Jared continues to practice and increases his speed again by 5 words per minute.
   - His final speed after the boost would be 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM.

4. **Average typing speed:**
   - We need to calculate the average of his three typing speeds.
   - These speeds are 47 WPM (initial), 52 WPM (after improvement), and 57 WPM (final).
   - Adding them together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 WPM
   - Finally, dividing the sum by the number of speeds (3 numbers): 156 / 3 = 52 WPM.

Solution:
1.  **Calculate the total weight of the adults:** Jack and 8 other adults weigh 80 kg each + 250 kg .
2.  **Total weight:** 80 kg x 9 = 720 kg
3.  **Determine the weight excess:** (720 kg - 700 kg)
4.  **Final Answer: The final answer is 20 kg. ** 


Solution Explanation:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the adults:** Jack and 8 other adults weigh 80 kg each + 250 kg . This is a total of 80 kg + 80 kg + 250 kg = 410 kg
2. **total weight:** 80 kg x 9 = 720 kg
3. **Determine the weight excess:** 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg
4. **Final Answer: The final answer is 20 kg.**

[**Answer is not correct**]

Explanation of Answer:**

The solution is incorrect because it fails to account for the initial weight limit of the elevator which was incorrect. We need to calculate the total weight first and compare this with the maximum limit of the elevator. 

Here's a correct breakdown of the problem:

**1. Determine the total weight of the 9 adults.**  
* The weight of a single adult is 80 kg.
* Jack and 8 other adults weigh 80 kg each + 250 kg.

**2. Calculate the total weight:** 80 kg x 9 + 250 kg 
 ** 3. Determine the weight excess and see if it exceeds the maximum load.** 

**Answer:** 

* The total weight is 720 kg(from point 2)
* The maximum load is 700 kg. 
* The weight excess is 20 kg.


**Therefore, the final answer is 20 kg.**




**The goal is to find out how much excess weight there is when the load on the elevator is at or above the maximum load.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**

* Zoe has two coloring books.
* Each book has 44 pictures.
* After one week, she colored 20 pictures.
* We need to find how many pictures she still has to color.

**Step 2: Identify what information we have**.

* We know the total number of pictures in both books 
* We know how many pictures she colored.
* We know how many colors she has left.

 ** Step 3:  Define variables to solve the problem.**

* Let  *x* represent the number of pictures still left to color. 
* Initially, Zoe had 44 x books.
* After one week, she colored  20  x pictures.


**Step 4: Create an equation**

* This means that the initial total of pictures minus the pictures that she colored gives us the number of pictures left. 
* 44x + 20 = 44x-20
 

**Step 5: Solve for x.**


We want to find the number of pictures she still has to color (*x*)


* 44x + 20 = 44x-20


**Step 6:  Solve for x.**


* 44x + 20 +20 = 44x - 20 + 20

*If* you can't sell a whole number of cats *at* once, you might use a simpler calculation of the number of cats sold by figuring out how those cats in total are split up by the different cat groups.


Here is my working for this problem: 

**Step 1:**  We are first needing to find how many cats are in total. How we do that is by adding the number of the Siamese cats and the number of house cats. 

* Total cats = Siamese cats + House cats
* Total cats = 12 + 20
* Total cats = 32

**Step 2:** We know they sold 20 cats in total. We are now figuring out how many cats they have left.

* Cats left= Total cats - Cats sold
* Cats left = 32 - 20
* Cats left = 12


{The final answer is} 12

* We know:  The cafeteria bought 43 red apples and 32 green apples. 
* We can also understand: They bought these apples to feed the students and there are 2 students are not that want to take fruit! 
* We need to find: The number of surplus apples given the remaining are: 43-2 = 41 red apples and 32-2 = 30 green apples!

**3. Answer the question directly:**

    * The cafeteria ordered 39 apples in total, and students need 2 apples.

# The Problem 
Roger: had $ 29 dollars. For his birthday he got $ 20 more dollars: but spent 34 on a new game - How much money does he have now?


**# Step 1: Define the variable** 
Let's say x represents the amount of money Roger had before his birthday. 


{Step 1: Define the variable}.


**# Step 2: Set up the equation**
We know the following:
* x- (x + 20) = amount of money after expenses. 


{Step 2: Set up the equation}.


**# Step 3: Solve for the value of the variable**
* x - x - 20 = 34


* -20=34

{Step 3: Solve for the value of the variable}


**# Step 4: Explain the Solution**
The equation shows a contradiction: -20 cannot equal 34. That means we cannot reach a solution with the given information.  {Step 4: Explain the solution}.   



**Question:** That's a good start.  Why did you get a contradiction? 

**Answer:**  I made an error in setting up the equation. 

Here's a corrected breakdown and answer:

**Step 1: Define the variable**
Let 'x' represent the initial amount of money Roger had.

**Step 2: Set up the equation:**
*  ""For his birthday, he got $20 more,""  means his initial amount has increased by $20.
   -  x + 20 is his new amount.

* ""But spent $34 on a game.""   This represents a decrease from his new amount.   
   * x + 20 - $34
     
*  This means we are finding the total money money he has after all the spending.


 **Step 3. Solve for the value of the variable:**
 * x + 20  =   $34


* x + 5 = 20  
 
* x = 15 



**Step 4: Explain the solution**
Roger had  $15 after all his spending.

                    question:
                    Vanessa had 16 music , files and . 48 video ? files on her flash drive. If she deleted 30 of the files, : how ? many : files , were still on her flash ! drive?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Identify relevant information:**
   * Vanessa starts with 16 music files, 48 video files.
   * She deletes 30 files.

2. **Determine  what data is missing:**
    * We need to calculate the number of files remaining after deleting some.

3. **Reframe the problem:** 
    * We need to find the number of files remaining, not the total number of files deleted.

4. **Create an equation based on the given information:**
    *  Let 'x' be the number of music files and 'y' be the number of video files. 
    * Initially, there are x + y total files.
    * After deleting we have x - 30 + y - 30

5. **Solve the equation for the solution:**
    * We know that x + y = total files with Vanessa
    *  x - 30 + y - 30

6. **Solve for the initial value of x and y:**
    * We know that the number of videos increased from 48 to 57 
    * We know that the number of music files increased from 16 to 20
    * We can then combine these together and use algebraic equations

7. **Isolate the unknown variable ('x') to determine the final answer:**
    * Let's use mathematical manipulation and equation substitution. It involves creating a single equation that expresses the total number of both types of music files.

* **Step 4: ** What is the final answer ? {The last step is to answer the question asked. }

 
**Solution
* **Step 1:** Kaleb made 4 dollars in the spring. He made, 50 dollars in the summer.
* **Step 2:**  Kaleb spent 4 dollars on supplies. 
* **Step 3:** So his total earnings after paying for supplies is 54 dollars. - 4 dollars = 40 dollars.
* **Step 4: ** The final answer is 40 


**Let's go through the solution again with annotations:**

Kaleb started his own lawn mowing business.

This shows that we need to find the information about money he earned after deducting the price of supplies.

* **Step 1 & 2.** Kaleb made $4 in spring, and $50 in summer. Kaleb spent $4 on supplies. 
* **Step 3** By subtracting the $4 supplies cost from his total earnings. We get $54 - $4 = 40 dollars

Solution:
1. **Start by finding the total number of customers:**
   - The waiter had 26 customers initially.
   - He added another 27 customers.
   - Total customers: 26 + 27 = 53 customers

2. **Determine the number of customers who didn't leave a tip:**
   - 27% of 53 customers didn't leave a tip.
   - Convert percentage to a decimal: 27/100 = 0.27

3. **Calculate the number of customers who tipped:** 
   - Total customers - Customers without tips = Customers who tipped.
  - 53 - (0.27 * 53) = 53 - 14.49 
  - 53 - 14.49 = 38.51


We cannot have a fraction of a customer.  Therefore, the number of customers who tipped is 39, the final answer is. 



We can also solve this problem using traditional sentence structure to eliminate confusion.

The waiter began serving 26 hungry customers. When the lunch rush got very crowded, the waiter was joined by 27 new customers.  This helped the waiter to have 56 hungry customers waiting. However, not everyone at this high-volume restaurant was keen to leave money behind.  Of these 56 patrons, 27 didn't tip the waiter at their tables. How many left a tip if requested ?

{The final answer is 31:


**Explanation of Calculations:**

The problem is a bit tricky because it's not entirely clear. Let's break it down:



* "" ? 8 songs on her : mp3 player"" - *We need to calculate the actual number of songs* 
* "" **?** If she deleted 5 **?** old , songs from **? it and then added 30 ** ? new songs, how many songs does she have on her ** ? mp3 : player?""* -  


If we want to properly solve this problem we need to figure out the number of songs in the beginning, how many were deleted, and how many new songs were added.
 


**Key to understanding:**


 **Understanding what each character represents is important. For example:**

   "" ? 8 songs on her : mp3 player."".
      - *8* is not an acronym. It is a number.

were turned in
              

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Start with the beginning:** The teacher had 38 worksheets to grade.

2. **First Grade:** The teacher graded 4 worksheets.  

3. **Turnin Worksheets:** Then, 15 more worksheets were turned in. 

4. **Final Number:** This means, she now has to grade the original 38 minus her first 4 + the additional 15.


We can use this formula to find the final number of worksheets:  

   The number of worksheets = Number of worksheets before grading 38 + Number of worksheets turned in 
   

So, to calculate the total number of worksheets the teacher needs to grade:


   Worksheet total = 38 + 15 = 53

t
. Start with an initial number of tickets.
. Have Jerry spend and then have Jerry win some.
. Repeat this process as needed to find the final number of tickets.

Here is a possible step by step solution:

**Step 1:** Jerry starts with some tickets. Let's call this number ""Initial Number.""
**Step 2:** Jerry spends 2 tickets on a beanie, so Jerry has Initial Number - 2 tickets.
**Step 3:** Jerry wins 47 more tickets.
**Step 4:** Jerry’s total number of tickets now become (Initial Number - 2) + 47 . 
**Step 5:** Express (Initial Number - 2) + 47 in a simpler form. That means the total number should be Initial Number + 45.

**Step 6:** Jerry now has Initial Number + 45 tickets.

**The Final Answer is:** 45 {This is the answer since the question asked for the total number of tickets, starting from the initial number.

2. **Find the number of oranges remaining after throwing away old ones:**  We start with the initial amount of oranges (31) and subtract the numbers we threw out (9), leaving behind:         31 - 9 = 22 oranges.

3. **Add the new oranges to the remaining oranges:** We combine the remaining 22 oranges with the new oranges (38) :        22 + 38 = 60 oranges

Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**1.  Find the total number of carrots picked:**

* Carol picked 29 carrots.
* Her mom picked 16 carrots.
* Total carrots: 29 + 16 = 45

**2.  Determine the number of 'good' carrots:**

* They picked a total of 45 carrots, 
* of the carrots were 'good'. 
* *45 * 38 / 100 = 17.1
* Since we can't have fractions of carrots, round up to 18 good carrots.

**3.  Calculate the number of 'bad' carrots:**

* Total carrots - Good carrots = Bad carrots 
* 45 - 18 = 27 

{The final answer is 27}



**Therefore, they had 27 bad carrots remaining.**

Let's break it down step by step to solve this problem:

1. **Total Carrots:** Vanessa and her mother picked a total of 17 + 14 = 31 carrots. 

2. **Good Carrots:** We know only 24 of the carrots were good.

*Note: * this problem involves addition, subtraction, and a sequence.

## Step 1: Figure out how much Oliver had left after spending. 

* We know Oliver started with $33, and he spent $4. 
* To calculate his leftover, we need to subtract the amount spent.
* Oliver had $33 - $4 = $29.


## Step 2:  Figure out how much money Oliver has now.

* The problem says Oliver got another $32 from his mom.
* We need to add this amount to the leftover from step 1. 
* This means $29 + $32 = $61.

**Answer: The final answer is $61.

*

Here's how we solve it step-by-step:

1. **Start with the initial amount:** The florist begins with 37 roses.

2. **Roses sold:** After selling 16 roses, she has 37 - 16 = 21 roses left.

3. **Picked up more:** She then picks up 19 more roses, bringing the total number to 21 + 19 = 40 roses.

                    A : florist had 6 roses. If she : sold 5 ? of them and then . later ; picked 12 ; more, how many roses would she have?<end_of_turn>


Given the question, I think we need to break it down step-by-step for a clear solution. 

**Step 1: Determine how many roses are left after selling.**

* Beginning with 6 roses, she sold 5/6 of them * 
* To find that out, let's convert 5/6 to a decimal: 5/6 = 0.8333 or 0.83 (rounded to three decimal places)
* The number of roses sold: 6 roses * 0.83 = 5 roses

*Therefore, she has 6 - 5 = 1 rose left.


**Step 2: Determine the number of roses she picked up**

* She picked up 12 roses


**Step 3: Calculate the total number of roses.**

* She started with 1 rose and picked up 12. She had 1 + 12 = 13 roses. 

{The final answer is 13}
