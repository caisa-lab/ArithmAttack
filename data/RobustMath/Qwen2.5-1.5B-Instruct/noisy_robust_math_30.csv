                    question:
                    A ? robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber ! and half that much ? white ! fiber.  ; How , many bolts in total does it take?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. **Blue Fiber**: The problem states that ""A ? robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.""
   - This means there are 2 bolts of blue fiber required for one ""robe.""

2. **White Fiber**: It also mentions ""and half that much ? white fiber.""
   - Since the number of bolts of white fiber is stated to be ""half"" that of blue fiber, we need to calculate half of 2.

Let's perform the calculation:

\[ \text{Number of bolts of white fiber} = \frac{\text{Number of bolts of blue fiber}}{2} \]

Substituting the known value:

\[ \text{Number of bolts of white fiber} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

So, there is 1 bolt of white fiber.

3. **Total Number of Bolts**:
   - To find the total number of bolts needed for both types of fibers, we add the number of bolts of blue fiber and the number of bolts of white fiber together.

\[ \text{Total number of bolts} = \text{Number of bolts of blue fiber} + \text{Number of bolts of white fiber} \]
\[ \text{Total number of bolts} = 2 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Total number of bolts} = 3 \]

Therefore, the total number of bolts needed is \( \boxed{3} \).<|im_end|>",3

                    question:
                    John takes care : of 10 dogs.  Each ; dog takes .5 hours a day to walk and , take ! care . of their business.  How : many . hours a week does he spend : taking ! care ? of dogs?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much time John spends caring for his dogs in a week. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate daily time spent on walking
John has 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours per day to be walked.

\[
\text{Total daily time spent on walking} = \text{Number of dogs} \times \text{Time per dog}
\]

\[
= 10 \times 0.5 \text{ hours}
\]

\[
= 5 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate total weekly time spent on walking
There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily time by 7.

\[
\text{Total weekly time spent on walking} = \text{Daily time} \times \text{Days per week}
\]

\[
= 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week}
\]

\[
= 35 \text{ hours/week}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total time spent on other activities
Each dog also needs care for its business (which is not specified but assumed as part of the overall care).

We assume that John spends an equal amount of time on all activities, including the time he walks the dogs.

Given that the total time spent on walking accounts for most of the time, let's assume that the rest of the time is equally distributed among other activities.

However, since no specific information about other activities was provided, we will only consider the walking time for now.

### Final Answer
John spends **35 hours** a week taking care of his dogs. This includes the time spent walking them. The remaining time would be allocated between other activities depending on what those activities are.<|im_end|>",35

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert all measurements to the same unit**:
   - Tracy has 4 feet of wire.
   - Each piece of wire is 6 inches long.

2. **Convert feet to inches** (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
   - 4 feet = 4 × 12 inches = 48 inches.

3. **Determine how many pieces can be made from 48 inches**:
   - Each piece is 6 inches long.
   - Number of pieces = Total length / Length per piece = 48 inches / 6 inches = 8 pieces.

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

{The final answer is} 8 pieces.<|im_end|>",8

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the initial depth of the water on Monday**
- The tank's initial depth is given as 17 feet.

**Step 2: Calculate the additional water added to the tank on Tuesday**
- On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than it did on Monday.
- Therefore, the total depth after adding 7 feet on Tuesday = Initial depth + Additional water
- Total depth on Tuesday = 17 feet (Monday) + 7 feet = 24 feet

**Step 3: Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday**
- On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of its depth on Tuesday.
- Depth on Wednesday = Two-thirds * Depth on Tuesday
- Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24 feet

Let's calculate the final value for the depth on Wednesday:

\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 24 \]
\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = 16 \]

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is **16 feet**.<|im_end|>",16

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent**

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Add these amounts together to find the total expenditure.

$$
\text{Total Amount Spent} = \$4.20 + \$9.45 + \$1.35
$$

Let's add them up:

$$
\$4.20 + \$9.45 = \$13.65 \\
\$13.65 + \$1.35 = \$15.00
$$

So, the total amount spent is **$15.00**.

**Step 2: Determine the change given back**

The mother paid **$20** in total. To find out how much change she received, subtract the total amount spent from the amount she paid.

$$
\text{Change Given Back} = \text{Amount Paid} - \text{Total Amount Spent}
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
\$20 - \$15.00 = \$5.00
$$

Therefore, the cashier gave her **$5.00** in change.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Determine how much Annika spent on food and snacks.
- Annika initially had $50.
- She spent half of her money on food and snacks.

Half of $50 is calculated as follows:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount after spending on food and snacks.
- After spending $25 on food and snacks, we subtract that from the initial amount:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Now, she has $25 left.

Step 3: Add the cost of the rides.
- She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

Total spent so far:
\[ 25 (food & snacks) + 10 (rides) = 35 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total spent from the original amount.
- We start with $50 and subtract what she spent:
\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount left is $15.

Final Answer:
The final answer is: The amount left is $15.<|im_end|>",15

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total amount of money Andrea started with:**
   - Andrea starts with $36.

2. **Determine what happens to her money after spending:**
   - Andrea spends part of her money on an $11 sweater.
   - She also gives her brother $4.

3. **Calculate how much money Andrea has left after these expenditures:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money Andrea saves initially.
   - After spending $11 on the sweater, she has \( x - 11 \).
   - After giving $4 to her brother, she has \( (x - 11) - 4 = x - 15 \).

4. **Set up an equation based on the given information:**
   - The remaining amount after all expenditures should equal the initial amount minus whatever was saved initially.
   - Therefore, we have: \( x - 15 = 36 - x \)

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Add \( x \) to both sides of the equation: 
     \[ 2x - 15 = 36 \]
   - Add 15 to both sides:
     \[ 2x = 51 \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[ x = 25.5 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many oranges Stetson actually ate.
2. Calculate the total amount of money Stetson lost based on the number of oranges he ate.

Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Determine the number of oranges Stetson ate

Stetson ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the oranges picked from the farm. Since they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

\[
\text{Number of oranges eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60
\]

Calculate this value:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Stetson lost

According to his bet, Stetson gives up $10 for each orange he eats. Therefore, if he ate 24 oranges, the total amount of money he loses is:

\[
\text{Total loss} = 24 \times 10
\]

Calculate this value:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Thus, Stetson gave up a total of $240.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the speed of the plane.
- The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours.
- Speed = Distance / Time
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

### Step 2: Determine the time needed to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed.
- We know the plane can travel 1200 miles in 3 hours.
- Using the speed we calculated (400 miles per hour), we can find out how long it takes to travel any distance at that speed.
- Time = Distance / Speed
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the additional time required to travel the remaining distance.
- It already took 3 hours to travel 1200 miles.
- Therefore, the additional time required to travel the remaining 2000 miles is:
\[ \text{Additional time} = 5 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

To determine how much butter Juan needs to make croissants, we'll follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants**
- Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissons per day.
- There are 7 days in a week.

\[ \text{Total croissons} = 4 \times 7 = 28 \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of butter needed for one dozen croissons**
- We know that it takes \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissons.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of butter needed for all the croissons**
- For 28 dozen croissons:

\[ \text{Butter required} = 28 \times \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \]

**Step 4: Simplify the calculation**

\[
\begin{align*}
28 \times \frac{1}{4} &= 28 \div 4 \\
&= 7
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, Juan will need **7 pounds** of butter to make the croissons over the course of a week.<|im_end|>",7

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate how much meat Prince can sell in one day**

- Prince sells 15 kg of meat per hour.
- He works for 10 hours a day.

So, his daily sales volume is:
\[ 15 \text{ kg/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 150 \text{ kg/day} \]

**Step 2: Determine how long it takes Prince to sell Bill's bull**

- The bull weighs 750 kg.
- Prince sells 150 kg per day.

So, we need to find out how many days it would take Prince to sell all the meat from the bull (assuming he continues at his current rate).

Using the formula:
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Daily sales}} \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden:**
   - The garden consists of 10 rows.
   - Each row contains 20 flowers.

   \[
   \text{Total number of flowers} = 10 \times 20 = 200
   \]

2. **Determine the fraction of flowers that have bloomed:**
   - According to the problem, only \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the flowers have bloomed.

3. **Calculate the number of flowers that have bloomed:**
   - Multiply the total number of flowers by the blooming fraction:

   \[
   \text{Number of flowers that have bloomed} = 200 \times \frac{4}{5}
   \]

   To perform this multiplication:

   \[
   200 \times \frac{4}{5} = 200 \times 0.8 = 160

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine the number of surfers who can remain upright.
2. Calculate the number of surfers who are women among those who can remain upright.
3. Find out how many surfers are not women (i.e., men) who can remain upright.

Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Determine the number of surfers who can remain upright
Given:
- Total number of surfers = 100
- Percentage of surfers who can remain upright when a wave > 30 feet = 25%

Number of surfers who can remain upright = \( \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the number of surfers who are women among those who can remain upright
Given:
- Percentage of women among those who can remain upright = 60%

Number of women who can remain upright = \( \frac{60}{100} \times 25 = 15 \)

### Step 3: Find out how many surfers are not women (men) who can remain upright
Total number of surfers - Number of women who can remain upright = Number of men who can remain upright

Number of men who can remain upright = \( 100 - 15 = 85 \)

So, the number of men who can remain upright on the wave is **85**.<|im_end|>",10

To determine how many pages Shiela has left to write, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Pages Required**: The total number of pages in the research paper is given as 15.

2. **Pages Completed**: Shiela has completed \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the paper. To find out how many pages this represents, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Pages Completed} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages}
   \]

3. **Pages Left to Write**: To find out how many pages Shiela still needs to write, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages:
   \[
   \text{Pages Left to Write} = 15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of candy initially.
2. Calculate the total amount of candy after sharing it equally among three people.

Let's start with the first step:

### Step 1: Total Initial Candy Amount
Robert has 3 pounds of candy, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. So, the total initial amount of candy is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 2: Sharing the Candy Equally
They decide to pool all their candy together and then share it equally among themselves. There are three people involved (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron), so each person will receive an equal portion of the total candy.

Since there are three people, each person will get:
\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, each of them would have **4 pounds** of candy after sharing and pooling the candy together.

<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of children in each generation until we reach the ""great grandbabies"" level.

1. **Great Grandma Jones** has 3 children.
2. Each of these children has 3 children (grandchildren).
   - Total number of grandchildren: \(3 \times 3 = 9\).

Now let's consider the next generation:

3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 children (great-grandchildren).
   - Total number of great-grandchildren: \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Finally, let's calculate the total number of great-grandbabies:

4. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children, each having 3 children, and those children have 3 more children, making them great-grandbabies.
   - Total number of great-grandbabies: \(3 + 27 = 30\).

So, if all members of the family show up at the family reunion, there would be **30 great grandbabies** that Great Grandma Jones can kiss.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more hours the firefighters need to raise money to meet their goal.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the total goal**: The firefighters aim to raise $6300.
2. **Determine how much has already been raised**: They have raised $2100 after 3 hours.
3. **Calculate the remaining amount needed**: 
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = \text{Total Goal} - \text{Amount Raised}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = \$6300 - \$2100 = \$4200
   \]

4. **Assume an equal amount raised per hour for simplicity (though it might not be true)**:
   
5. **Divide the remaining amount by the hourly contribution**:
   \[
   \text{Hourly Contribution} = \frac{\text{Remaining Amount}}{\text{Number of Hours}}
   \]
   Let's assume that they will contribute equally each hour for simplicity. 

6. **Calculate the number of additional hours needed**:
   \[
   \text{Additional Hours Needed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Amount}}{\text{Hourly Contribution}}
   \]

Let’s calculate these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining amount needed**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = \$6300 - \$2100 = \$4200
   \]

2. **Assume an equal amount raised per hour for simplicity**:
   \[
   \text{Hourly Contribution} = \frac{\$4200}{\text{Number of Hours}}
   \]

Since we don't know the exact number of hours yet, let's denote the number of hours as \( h \). If they can raise an equal amount per hour, then:
   \[
   \text{Hourly Contribution} = \frac{\$4200}{h}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional hours needed**:
   \[
   \text{Additional Hours Needed} = \frac{\$4200}{\text{Hourly Contribution}}
   \]

Given that they want to raise the same amount each hour, if they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours, they would need to raise $700 per hour ($2100 / 3).

Therefore, the calculation becomes:
   \[
   \text{Additional Hours Needed} = \frac{\$4200}{\$700/hour} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, they still need to raise $4200 over the next 6 hours.

Thus, the final answer is: They have to raise money for a total of 6 hours to reach their goal.<|im_end|>",9

2. **Determine how many people will share the money**: Greg and his three younger siblings make a total of four people (Greg + 3 siblings).

3. **Calculate the number of shares needed**: Since there are four people sharing the money, we need to divide the total amount ($20) by four.

4. **Perform the division**:
   \[

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of students who do not like any hobby.
- Total students in the class = 50
- Students who like baking = 10
- Students who like playing basketball = 5

Total students who like at least one hobby = \( 10 + 5 \) = 15

Therefore, the number of students who do not like any hobby = \( 50 - 15 \) = 35.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of students who like to either play video games or play music.
Since all remaining students (those who do not like any hobby) must be divided between two activities, we can denote:
\[ x \] as the number of students who like video games.
\[ y \] as the number of students who like music.

Given that \( y \) is twice the number of students who like basketball (\( 5 \)), we have:
\[ y = 2 \times 5 \]
\[ y = 10 \]

Thus, the total number of students who like either video games or music is:
\[ x + y \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \), the number of students who like video games.
From the total number of students who do not like any hobby:
\[ x + y = 35 \]

Substitute \( y \) with 10:
\[ x + 10 = 35 \]
\[ x = 35 - 10 \]
\[ x = 25 \]

### Final Answer:
The number of students who like to play video games is **25**.<|im_end|>",25

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals requiring grooming across all types.

1. **Dogs**: There are 8 dogs.
2. **Cats**: There are 5 cats.
3. **Birds**: There are 3 birds.
4. **Horses**: There are 12 horses.

First, let's add up all these numbers to find the total number of animals needing grooming:

\[ \text{Total number of animals} = 8 (\text{dogs}) + 5 (\text{cats}) + 3 (\text{birds}) + 12 (\text{horses}) \]

\[ \text{Total number of animals} = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 \]
\[ \text{Total number of animals} = 28 \]

Next, since Melissa splits her work evenly over the weekdays (Monday to Friday), we divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Number of animals per day} = \frac{\text{Total number of animals}}{\text{Number of days}} \]

\[ \text{Number of animals per day} = \frac{28}{5} \]

Now, performing the division:

\[ \text{Number of animals per day} = 5.6 \]

Therefore, Melissa will groom 5.6 animals each day. Since you can't have half an animal, it would mean some days she might have to groom slightly more or less than this amount based on the remainder from dividing the total number of animals by the number of days.

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5.6}

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday (which is 2).

Let's calculate the number of matches Joey played on Saturday:
\[ \text{Matches on Saturday} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Now, let's add up all the matches from Monday, Friday, and Saturday:
\[ \text{Total Matches} = 2 (\text{Monday}) + 1 (\text{Friday}) + 4 (\text{Saturday}) = 7 \]

So, Joey played a total of 7 matches last week.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Amount**: Marissa started with $80.
2. **Cost of Ball**: She spent $20 on a ball.
   - Remaining amount after buying the ball: \( 80 - 20 = 60 \) dollars.

3. **Amount Left After Buying Candy Bars**:
   - We need to find out how much money remains after she buys candy bars for her brother Jimmy.
   - Let's denote the number of candy bars she buys as \( x \).
   - Each candy bar costs $5.
   - The total cost for \( x \) candy bars will be \( 5x \).

4. **Equation Setup**:
   - The remaining amount after buying the ball and the candy bars should equal the initial amount left after the ball purchase.
   - Therefore, we set up the equation: 
     \[
     60 = 5x
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{60}{5} = 12
     \]

Thus, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for her brother Jimmy.

**Final Answer**: Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.<|im_end|>",12

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Discount Rate
A 20% discount means that for every dollar spent, you only need to pay 80 cents.

### Step 2: Calculate the Amount After Discount
First, we'll calculate what 20% of the original price is.
- Original Price = $1000
- Discount Rate (percentage) = 20%

Discounted Price = Original Price - (Original Price × Discount Rate)

Let's perform the calculation:

\[ \text{Discount} = \$1000 \times 0.20 = \$200 \]

Now subtract this from the original price:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \$1000 - \$200 = \$800 \]

So far, we've calculated that after applying the 20% discount, you would pay $800.

### Step 3: Verify the Calculation
Let's double-check our calculations:

- Original Price = $1000
- Discount Rate = 20%
- Discount Amount = $200
- Discounted Price = $800

This confirms that if you take advantage of the 20% discount on a $1000 laptop, you will indeed end up paying $800.

<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Determine the value of one bottle cap:**
   - Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

2. **Calculate the total number of bottle caps Damien collects over 30 days:**
   - He gets 10 bottle caps per day.
   - Over 30 days, he will collect \( 10 \times 30 = 300 \) bottle caps.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Damien makes from these bottle caps:**
   - Since each bottle cap is worth $0.25,
     then for 300 bottle caps, he would earn \( 300 \times 0.25 \).

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   300 \times 0.25 = 75
   \]

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month from collecting bottle caps.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is $75.<|im_end|>",75

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total number of lion cubs**: The problem states that there are 14 lion cubs.

2. **Determine the number of male lions**: We know from the problem statement that the number of male lions is half the number of female lions. Since we have 12 female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of male lions} = \frac{\text{Number of female lions}}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of lions (including males)**: Now, add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together.
   \[
   \text{Total number of lions} = \text{Number of female lions} + \text{Number of male lions} + \text{Number of lion cubs}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total number of lions} = 12 (\text{female}) + 6 (\text{male}) + 14 (\text{cubs})
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \text{Total number of lions} = 12 + 6 + 14 = 32
   \]

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is {The final answer is} 32.<|im_end|>",32

To determine the total time Carrie's choir will spend singing, we need to consider the duration of each song and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the duration of each song:**
   - ""Deck the Halls"" (DTH) is given as 150 seconds.
   - ""Jingle Bells"" (JB) is given as 240 seconds.

2. **Calculate the total time for DTH:**

   \text{Total time for JB} = 240 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Sum the durations of both songs to get the total time spent singing:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Total time for DTH} + \text{Total time for JB}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 150 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 390 \text{ seconds}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays.
- On Wednesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
- Twice as many chimichangas are made on Friday compared to Tuesday.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of chimichangas made on Friday
Since they make twice as many chimichangas on Friday as on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Chimichangas on Friday} = 2 \times \text{Chimichangas on Tuesday} \]
Given that they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday, we can substitute:
\[ \text{Chimichangas on Friday} = 2 \times 125 \]

### Step 3: Perform the calculation for Friday
\[ \text{Chimichangas on Friday} = 2 \times 125 = 250 \]

### Step 4: Sum up the total number of chimichangas made over the three days
Now, add the number of chimichangas from all three days:
\[ \text{Total chimichangas} = \text{Chimichangas on Monday (Tuesday)} + \text{Chimichangas on Wednesday} + \text{Chimichangas on Friday} \]
Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Total chimichangas} = 125 (\text{Tuesday}) + 125 (\text{Wednesday}) + 250 (\text{Friday}) \]

### Step 5: Perform the addition
\[ \text{Total chimichangas} = 125 + 125 + 250 \]

### Step 6: Final calculation
\[ \text{Total chimichangas} = 500 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on these three days is **500**.<|im_end|>",500

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Determine how much Adam's parents gave him.
- Adam's mother gave him $6.
- Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money given to Adam.
- Total amount from his parents = Mother's gift + Father's gift
\[= \$6 + \$12\]
\[= \$18\]

### Step 3: Determine the remaining amount that Adam needs to buy his trousers.
- Cost of trousers = $30
- Amount contributed by his parents = $18
- Remaining amount needed = Cost of trousers - Amount contributed by parents
\[= \$30 - \$18\]
\[= \$12\]

### Step 4: Determine how much Adam has to contribute from his savings.
- The total amount Adam had to contribute is the remaining amount he still needs after his parents' contribution.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time James spends reading after going to bed. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of pages James has left to read.
James starts reading 3 pages before going to bed. If he reads 18 more pages before deciding to go to sleep, the total number of pages left to read is:
\[ 3 \text{ (initial pages)} + 18 \text{ (additional pages)} = 21 \text{ pages} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time James needs to read all remaining pages.
We know that it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages. Therefore, the time required to read one page is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \approx 3.33 \text{ minutes per page} \]

Now, if James needs to read 21 pages, the total time spent reading is:
\[ 21 \text{ pages} \times 3.33 \text{ minutes per page} \approx 70 \text{ minutes} \]

### Final Answer:
James spends approximately **70 minutes** reading.<|im_end|>",60

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed in one hour.

1. **Calculate the total number of puzzle pieces:**
   - Teddy worked on two puzzles.
   - Each puzzle has 500 pieces.
   - Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces is \(2 \times 500 = 1000\) pieces.

2. **Determine how much of each puzzle Teddy completed:**
   - Teddy completed half of the first puzzle.
   - Half of 500 pieces is \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) pieces.
   
3. **Calculate the time spent working on each puzzle:**
   - Teddy worked for one hour on both puzzles.
   - Since he completed half of each puzzle in the same amount of time, he must have placed 250 pieces per hour on each puzzle.

4. **Sum up the number of pieces placed in one hour:**
   - Since he placed 250 pieces on each puzzle, over one hour, he placed \(250 + 250 = 500\) pieces in total.

Therefore, the number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 500.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between Sofie and Brian's walking distances.
- We know that in 7 days, Sofie walks twice as far as Brian.

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days.
- Given that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days, we can calculate her total distance as follows:
\[ \text{Total distance Sofie walks} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} \]

Let's do the multiplication:
\[ 10 \times 7 = 70 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sofie will walk **70 miles** in 7 days.

### Step 3: Determine how much Brian walks based on the given information.
- Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we need to find out what fraction of the total distance Sofie walks corresponds to Brian’s walking distance.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of miles Brian walks in 7 days.

Given that Sofie walks 70 miles, and she walks twice as far as Brian:
\[ 70 \text{ miles (Sofie)} = 2B \]
where \( B \) represents the miles Brian walks.

We can solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{70}{2} \]
\[ B = 35 \]

Therefore, Brian will walk **35 miles** in 7 days.

### Final Answer:
Brian will walk **35 miles** in 7 days.<|im_end|>",35

   - \( 3 \times 40 = 120 \) gallons.

3. **Calculate the total amount of blood for ten sharks:**
   - Each shark has 120 gallons of blood.
   - To find the total for ten sharks, multiply the amount of blood in one shark by ten.
   - Therefore, the total amount of blood for ten sharks = \( 120 \times 10 \).

4. **Perform the multiplication to find out how many gallons of blood ten sharks have together:**
   - \( 120 \times 10 = 1200 \) gallons.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of pomelos Eve has initially:**
   Eve starts with 20 pieces of pomelos.

2. **Calculate what fraction of the initial amount remains after giving some away:**
   Eve ends up with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of her original amount. This means she gives away \(3 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\) of her pomelos.

3. **Calculate how many pomelos Eve gave away:**
   Since she started with 20 pomelos, the number of pomelos she gave away is:
   \[
   20 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{4}\right) = 20 \times \frac{3}{4} = 15
   \]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is: The number of pomelos Eve gave away is 15.<|im_end|>",15

                    question:
                    Ara joined the school ! basketball team four years ago. , She has been playing 40 ! games : every ? year. If ! her score for ; every , game is 21 points, calculate the total number of points she has , scored in . the four ; years.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many years have passed since Ara started playing.
2. Calculate the total number of games played over those years.
3. Multiply the total number of games by the points per game.

Step 1: Determine how many years have passed since Ara started playing.
- Ara joined the school basketball team four years ago.
- We are calculating the total points from the start until now (four years later).

Step 2: Calculate the total number of games played over those years.
- Each year, Ara plays 40 games.
- Since it's been four years, we multiply the number of games per year by the number of years:
\[ \text{Total Games} = 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

Step 3: Multiply the total number of games by the points per game.
- Each game gives 21 points.
- Therefore, the total points can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total Points} = 160 \times 21 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 160 \times 21 = 3360 \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is \(3360\). 

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the total number of photos:**
   Jade has taken 210 photos over the course of a week.

2. **Calculate the number of photos per batch:**
   Jade plans to upload 7 photos in each batch.

3. **Calculate the number of batches:**
   To find out how many batches she can make from 210 photos, divide the total number of photos by the number of photos per batch.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of batches} = \frac{\text{Total photos}}{\text{Photos per batch}} = \frac{210}{7}
   \]

4. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{210}{7} = 30
   \]
   So, Jade can make 30 batches of photos.

5. **Calculate the number of days needed to upload these batches:**
   Jade plans to upload 6 batches per day. Therefore, to find out how many days it takes to upload 30 batches, divide the total number of batches by the number of batches she uploads per day.
   
   \[
   \text{Days required} = \frac{\text{Total batches}}{\text{Batches per day}} = \frac{30}{6}
   \]

6. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{30}{6} = 5
   \]

Therefore, Jade will need **5 days** to upload all her photos.<|im_end|>",5

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Steve's total time.
2. Determine how much longer it took Anna compared to Steve.
3. Add that extra time to Steve's total time to find out how long Anna spent on her puzzle.

### Step 1: Calculate Steve's total time

Steve completed his puzzle in \(10!\) hours. We need to compute \(10!\).

\[
10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1
\]

Let's calculate this step-by-step:

\[
10 \times 9 = 90
\]
\[
90 \times 8 = 720
\]
\[
720 \times 7 = 5040
\]
\[
5040 \times 6 = 30240
\]
\[
30240 \times 5 = 151200
\]
\[
151200 \times 4 = 604800
\]
\[
604800 \times 3 = 1814400
\]
\[
1814400 \times 2 = 3628800
\]
\[
3628800 \times 1 = 3628800
\]

So, Steve's total time is 362,8800 hours.

### Step 2: Determine how much longer it took Anna compared to Steve

Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time.

First, find half of Steve's time:

\[
\frac{3628800}{2} = 1814400
\]

Now add 2 hours to this value:

\[
1814400 + 2 = 1814402
\]

So, Anna took 181,4402 hours to finish the puzzle.

### Step 3: Find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle

We have already calculated this in Step 2:

Anna took **181,4402** hours to finish the puzzle. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

\boxed{1814402}<|im_end|>",7

                    question:
                    The . caretaker of the docks needs to buy some new : line. He wants 3 : feet , of ! line for every . foot of ? dock. : Right now, there is 200 feet . of dock, and he has 6 . feet of new line. How many , feet of . line does . he , need to : buy in total?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more line the caretaker needs to buy based on the current amount of dock and the length of line required per foot of dock.

1. **Calculate the total length of line needed:**
   - The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every 1 foot of dock.
   - There are 200 feet of dock available.
   - Therefore, the total length of line needed = \(200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock}\).

\[
\text{Total line needed} = 200 \times 3 = 600 \text{ feet}
\]

2. **Calculate the total length of line already available:**
   - The caretaker currently has 6 feet of new line.
   - This is not relevant to calculating the additional line needed since it's only used if the available line isn't enough.

3. **Determine how much more line is needed:**
   - Total line needed = 600 feet.
   - Current available line = 6 feet (new line).
   
\[
\text{Additional line needed} = 600 \text{ feet} - 6 \text{ feet} = 594 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.<|im_end|>",594

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, let's break down the information given:

1. **Total number of customers**: Billy had 8 customers.
2. **First group of customers**:
   - First 3 customers: Each buys 1 DVD.
   - Total DVDs bought by these 3 customers = \(3 \times 1 = 3\) DVDs.

3. **Second group of customers**:
   - Next 2 customers: Each buys 2 DVDs.
   - Total DVDs bought by these 2 customers = \(2 \times 2 = 4\) DVDs.

4. **Third group of customers**:
   - Last 3 customers: Do not buy any DVDs.
   - Total DVDs bought by these 3 customers = \(3 \times 0 = 0\) DVDs.

Now, let's add up all the DVDs sold:

- From the first group: 3 DVDs
- From the second group: 4 DVDs
- From the third group: 0 DVDs

Adding them together:

To determine how many times the alarm rang in total, we need to calculate the number of rings for each instance and then sum them up.

1. **First Ring:**
   - It rang 4 times.
   
2. **Second Ring:**
   - It rang for three times longer than the first ring.
     \[
     \text{Number of rings} = 3 \times (\text{number of rings from the first ring}) = 3 \times 4 = 12
     \]
   
3. **Third Ring:**
   - It rang for half as long as the second ring.
     \[
     \text{Number of rings} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{number of rings from the second ring}) = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6
     \]

Now, let's sum the total number of rings:

\[
\text{Total rings} = \text{first ring} + \text{second ring} + \text{third ring} = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22

To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the ages of the children based on the given information.

Step 1: Determine the age relationship between James and Corey.
- We know that James is 10 years old.
- We also know that James is 1 year younger than Corey.
- Therefore, Corey must be \(10 + 1 = 11\) years old.

Step 2: Determine the age relationship between Amy and Jackson.
- We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
- Also, Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
- Since Corey is 11 years old, Amy must be \(11 - 2 = 9\) years old.
- And since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Jackson must be \(9 - 5 = 4\) years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of vehicles from the first day:**
   - Each container has 5 vehicles.
   - There are 2 containers.
   - Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day = \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) vehicles.

2. **Determine the number of vehicles imported on the second day:**
   - On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port is given as 30.
   - We know there are already 10 vehicles from the first day.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of containers imported on the second day.
   - Since each container still contains 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles on the second day can also be expressed as \( (x + 10) \).

3. **Set up the equation based on the total number of vehicles:**
   \[
   (x + 10) = 30
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x + 10 = 30 \\
   x = 30 - 10 \\

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine what percentage of the cars are semi-automatic, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of semi-automatic cars.
- We know there are 12 automatic cars.
- There are 4 manual cars.

Since the total number of cars is 20, we can find the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

\[
\text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars})
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars.
Now that we have determined there are 4 semi-automatic cars out of a total of 20 cars, we can calculate the percentage using the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the numbers:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
\frac{4}{20} = 0.2

So,

\[
\text{Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how much water remains after Celine uses some for her garden**

- The initial amount of water in the tank is 120 liters.
- Celine uses 90 liters of water.

Subtracting the amount used from the initial quantity gives us:
\[ \text{Remaining water} = 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

So, there are 30 liters remaining in the tank.

**Step 2: Calculate how much rainwater Celine collects**

- Rainwater collected is twice the amount left in the tank.
- Amount left in the tank (after using) = 30 liters.

Therefore, the amount of rainwater collected is:
\[ \text{Rainwater collected} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 3: Add the collected rainwater back to the remaining water in the tank**

- Remaining water in the tank after use + Rainwater collected = Total water in the tank now.

Calculating this sum:
\[ \text{Total water in the tank now} = 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water in the tank is **90 liters**.<|im_end|>",90

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for both Carlos and Benji's rental activities.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate Carlos's Rental Cost
Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour.
He uses the canoe for 3 hours.

\[
\text{Carlos's Cost} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Number of Hours}
\]
\[
\text{Carlos's Cost} = \$30 \times 3
\]
\[
\text{Carlos's Cost} = \$90
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate Benji's Rental Cost
Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 per hour.
He uses the raft for 5 hours.

\[
\text{Benji's Cost} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Number of Hours}
\]
\[
\text{Benji's Cost} = \$18 \times 5
\]
\[
\text{Benji's Cost} = \$90
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate Total Cost
Add together the costs from Carlos and Benji.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Carlos's Cost} + \text{Benji's Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$90 + \$90
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$180

                    question:
                    : James has 6 more ; candies than Robert. John has twice as many candies ? as Robert. If ! John has 54 candies, how ? many more candies does . John ; have than ? James?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of candies Robert has:**
   - We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert.
   - John has 54 candies.

2. **Calculate the number of candies Robert has:**
   \[
   \text{Number of candies Robert has} = \frac{\text{Number of candies John has}}{2}
   \]
   Substituting the value for John’s candies:
   \[
   \text{Number of candies Robert has} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]

3. **Determine the number of candies James has:**
   - James has 6 more candies than Robert.
   - Robert has 27 candies.

4. **Calculate the number of candies James has:**
   \[
   \text{Number of candies James has} = \text{Number of candies Robert has} + 6
   \]
   Substituting the value for Robert’s candies:
   \[
   \text{Number of candies James has} = 27 + 6 = 33
   \]

5. **Compare the number of candies John and James have:**
   - John has 54 candies.
   - James has 33 candies.

6. **Calculate how many more candies James has than John:**
   \[
   \text{Difference in number of candies} = \text{Number of candies James has} - \text{Number of candies John has}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Difference in number of candies} = 33 - 54 = -21
   \]

Therefore, James has 21 fewer candies than John. The final answer is: -21.<|im_end|>",21

<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the information provided and solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Chris's Trees:**
   - Chris has 6 trees.

2. **Ferdinand's Trees:**
   - Ferdinand has half the number of trees as Chris.
     \[
     \text{Number of Ferdinand's trees} = \frac{\text{Number of Chris's trees}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
     \]

3. **Harry's Trees:**
   - Harry has 5 more trees than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
     \[
     \text{Twice the number of Ferdinand's trees} = 2 \times 3 = 6
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of Harry's trees} = 6 + 5 = 11
     \]

4. **Comparison between Harry's and Ferdinand's yards:**
   - We need to find how many more trees are in Harry's yard compared to Ferdinand's yard.
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Number of Harry's trees} - \text{Number of Ferdinand's trees}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8
     \]

Therefore, there are **8 more trees** in Harry's yard compared to Ferdinand's yard.<|im_end|>",8

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of oranges that need washing:**
   - The total number of oranges bought is 15.
   - The oldest son is 8 years old.
   - The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son.

2. **Calculate the age of the youngest son:**
   \[
   \text{Youngest son's age} = \frac{\text{Oldest son's age}}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of oranges needed to be washed:**
   - Since the oldest son needs to wash oranges for his own age plus half the age of the youngest son,
     \[
     \text{Oranges needed} = \text{Age of oldest son} + \frac{\text{Age of youngest son}}{2} = 8 + \frac{4}{2} = 8 + 2 = 10 \text{ oranges}
     \]

4. **Subtract the number of oranges needed from the total number of oranges bought:**
   - Total oranges bought = 15
   - Oranges needed = 10
   - Oranges left unwashed = \( 15 - 10 = 5 \)

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time spent on each activity and then sum these values.

1. **Yoga Class on Monday**: 1 hour
2. **Cooking Class on Monday**: 3 times longer than the yoga class on Monday = \( 3 \times 1 \) hour = 3 hours
3. **Cheese Tasting Event on Tuesday**: 0.5 hours
4. **Museum Tour on Wednesday**: Half as long as the cooking class on Monday = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \) hours = 1.5 hours
5. **Errands on Thursday**: 2 hours

Now, let's add up all these durations:

\[
1 \text{ hour (Monday)} + 3 \text{ hours (Monday's Yoga)} + 0.5 \text{ hours (Tuesday's Cheese Tasting)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (Wednesday's Museum Tour)} + 2 \text{ hours (Thursday's Errands)}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of plant pots required:**
   - For the daisies, April needs 30 plant pots.
   - For the roses, she needs twice as many as for the daisies, which means \(2 \times 30 = 60\) plant pots.

2. **Calculate the total number of plant pots needed:**
   - Total plants pots needed = 30 (daisies) + 60 (roses) = 90 plant pots.

3. **Subtract the number of plant pots already bought from the total required:**
   - April has already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center.
   - Number of plant pots left after purchase = 100 (bought) - 90 (needed) = 10 plant pots.

4. **Verify the information about the donation:**
   - April asks for 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice that amount for the roses.
   - Since she asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice that amount for the roses, she would need \(30 \times 2 = 60\) plant pots for the roses.
   - The total for the roses should be \(30 + 60 = 90\), but since she only needs 30 for the daisies, her request seems inconsistent unless we consider her asking for more than she actually needs.

5. **Final calculation:**
   - After buying 100 plant pots, April will have 10 plant pots left.

Therefore, the final answer is:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

### Step 2: Determine how much money Dora currently has.
- Money saved from allowance: $2
- Money received from mother: $16

Total amount available = $2 + $16 = $18

### Step 3: Subtract the total cost from the amount Dora has to find out how much she needs.

Money needed = Total cost - Amount available

Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

### Conclusion:
Dora needs an additional $1 to buy all three items (the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball).

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps:

1. **Initial count**: Katelyn initially sees 50 fairies.
2. **Fairies joining from the east**: One friend sees twice as many fairies as Katelyn, which means they see \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) fairies.
3. **Fairies leaving after ten minutes**: Thirty fairies leave.

Now let's calculate the total number of fairies at different stages.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

**Stage 1: Initial Count**
Katelyn sees 50 fairies.

**Stage 2: Fairies joining from the east**
One friend sees \( 100 \) fairies (twice as many as Katelyn).

So, the total number of fairies now is:
\[ 50 + 100 = 150 \]

**Stage 3: Fairies leaving**
Thirty fairies leave.

So, the total number of fairies now is:
\[ 150 - 30 = 120 \]

Therefore, the final number of fairies remaining is \( 120 \).

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate daily costs
- **Morning rides**: Paul drives to work in the morning.
  - Number of mornings per day = 2
  - Cost per morning ride = $6
  - Total cost per day (morning) = 2 * $6 = $12

- **Afternoon rides**: Paul drives back home in the afternoon.
  - Number of afternoons per day = 2
  - Cost per afternoon ride = $2
  - Total cost per day (afternoon) = 2 * $2 = $4

- **Total daily cost**:
  - Total daily cost = $12 (morning) + $4 (afternoon) = $16

### Step 2: Calculate total weekly cost
- Paul does this for 14 days.

- Total weekly cost = 14 * $16 = $224

### Step 3: Calculate total monthly cost
- There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

- Monthly cost = 4 * $224 = $896

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

**Step 1: Determine how many gifts each friend wants**

Cherrie has 5 friends, and we know that:
- 2 friends want 5 gifts.
- The remaining 3 friends want 2 gifts each.

So, let's calculate the total number of gifts needed based on these numbers:

\[ \text{Total gifts} = (2 \times 5) + (3 \times 2) \]

Let's do the multiplication first:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now add these together:

\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \]

So, Cherrie needs to buy **16 gifts** in total before she gets extra surprises.

**Step 2: Add the additional 10 gifts**

Cherrie decides to get 10 more gifts as a surprise. So, we simply add these to the initial count:

\[ 16 + 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, Cherrie bought a total of **26 gifts**.

**Final Answer:**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of tulip rows**:  
   - We know that Jackson has enough red tulips to fill 6 tulip rows.
   - Similarly, he has enough blue tulips to fill 8 tulip rows.

2. **Calculate total tulips**:
   - Since both colors have their respective tulip counts, we add them together: 
     \[
     6 \text{ (red)} + 8 \text{ (blue)} = 14 \text{ tulips}
     \]

3. **Divide the total number of tulips by the number of tulips per row**:
   - To find out how many rows of flowers he can make from his total tulips, divide the total number of tulips by the number of tulips per row:
     \[
     \frac{14 \text{ tulips}}{\text{tulips per row}} = 1.5 \text{ rows}
     \]

Since Jackson cannot plant half a row, he can only plant complete rows.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To determine how many additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of water bottles Bill already has:**
   - Bill starts with 2 cases.
   - Each case contains 24 bottles.
   - Therefore, the total number of bottles Bill currently has is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

2. **Determine the total number of guests:**
   - There are 70 guests.

3. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for all guests:**
   - If Bill wants to give 2 bottles per guest, then the total number of bottles needed is \(70 \times 2 = 140\).

4. **Subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number needed:**
   - The difference between what he needs and what he already has is \(140 - 48 = 92\).

Therefore, Bill needs to buy an additional **92** bottles of water.<|im_end|>",92

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine how old Shiloh's nephew is today. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Current Age of Shiloh**:
   Shiloh is currently 44 years old.

2. **Age Difference**:
   Since they are the same age, there is no age difference between them at present.

3. **Future Ages**:
   - In 7 years from now, Shiloh will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old.
   - At that time, his nephew will be \( x \) years old (where \( x \) is unknown).

4. **Relationship in 7 Years**:
   According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.
   
   So, in 7 years, Shiloh's age can be expressed as: 
   \[
   51 = 3(x)
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   We need to find out how many years ago (today) the relationship holds true.
   \[
   51 = 3x
   \]
   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   x = \frac{51}{3} = 17
   \]

6. **Current Age of Nephew**:
   If the relationship holds true today, then the nephew is already 17 years old.

Therefore, the nephew is today:

Next to him ? sat a Dachshund, who ? weighed twice as much as ; the Affenpinscher.  Next to the . Dachshund sat a Papillon, ! who weighed ! one-fourth as much ; as ! the ; Dachshund.  . And at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, ; who weighed 44 times the weight of ; the ? Papillon.  How much did , the Mastiff weigh, ! in pounds?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how much the Mastiff weighs, we need to follow the given information step-by-step:

1. **First Dog (Affenpinscher):**
   - Weight: 10 pounds.

2. **Second Dog (Dachshund):**
   - Weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher.
     \[
     \text{Weight of Dachshund} = 2 \times 10 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Third Dog (Papillon):**
   - Weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.
     \[
     \text{Weight of Papillon} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \text{ pounds} = 5 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Fourth Dog (Mastiff):**
   - Weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon.
     \[
     \text{Weight of Mastiff} = 44 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 220 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Thus, the weight of the Mastiff is **220 pounds**.<|im_end|>",220

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( S \) represent the number of snowflake stamps.
Let \( T \) represent the number of truck stamps.
Let \( R \) represent the number of rose stamps.

Given:
- \( S = 16 \)
- \( T > S \) (since he bought more truck stamps than snowflake stamps)
- \( R < T \) (since he bought fewer rose stamps than truck stamps)

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Information
From the information given:
1. The total number of stamps is 16 + \(T\) + \(R\).
2. Since there are only three types of stamps, we can write the equation for the total as:
\[ S + T + R = 16 + T + R \]

Since the total must equal the sum of all stamps, we have:
\[ 16 + T + R = 16 + T + R \]
This confirms our setup.

### Step 3: Use the Relationships Between Stamps
We know that:
- \( T > S \), so \( T \) is greater than 16.
- \( R < T \), so \( R \) is less than \( T \).

Since \( T \) is the largest quantity, we need to find values for \( T \) and \( R \) such that they satisfy these conditions and add up correctly.

### Step 4: Solve for \( T \) and \( R \)
Given \( S = 16 \):
- Let’s try different values for \( T \) starting from above 16.
- If \( T = 20 \), then \( R \) would be less than 20 but still greater than 16 because \( R < T \).

Let's check if \( T = 20 \) works:
- If \( T = 20 \), then \( R \) must be less than 20.
- Let's assume \( R = 15 \). This satisfies \( R < T \).

Now, let's verify the total number of stamps:
\[ S + T + R = 16 + 20 + 15 = 51 \]

So, the total number of stamps is indeed 51.

### Conclusion
Max bought 51 stamps in total.

Therefore, the final answer is:

   - Vanilla scents: 
     - Sold: 5
   - Fruity scents:

2. **Calculate how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents:**

Let's start calculating:

- Number of vanilla scents sold = 5
- Number of fruity scents sold = 2

Now, subtract the number of fruity scents from the number of vanilla scents:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Vanilla scents sold} - \text{Fruity scents sold} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 3 \]

<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling eggs.
Bennet sold 20 eggplants at $3 each.

\[
\text{Revenue from eggs} = 20 \times \$3 = \$60
\]

### Step 2: Determine the remaining amount needed after selling eggs.
Bennet aims to make a total of $135.

\[
\text{Remaining amount} = \$135 - \$60 = \$75
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of ears of corn Bennet can sell.
Bennet has 25 ears of corn that he can sell.

### Step 4: Set up an equation to find the price per ear of corn.
Let \( x \) be the price per ear of corn.

\[
x \times 25 = \text{Total revenue}
\]

We know the total revenue must equal the remaining amount ($75).

\[
x \times 25 = \$75
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \).
Divide both sides by 25 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{\$75}{25} = \$3
\]

### Conclusion:
Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3 to reach his goal of making a total of $135.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    question:
                    ; Carson lives : in an old ! house : where ? the pipes will freeze if the temperature , inside the house falls below 32 , degrees. ; Every log ; of wood Carson burns heats . the house ; up by 5 degrees. , If it was 45 degrees during the day, and . it's 33 degrees : colder during , the night ; compared to ? the day, how many ; logs : does Carson need to burn to prevent the , pipes from freezing?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and determine the steps required:

1. **Understanding the situation**:
   - The pipes will freeze when the indoor temperature drops below 32 degrees.
   - Each log of wood increases the indoor temperature by 5 degrees.

2. **Given data**:
   - During the day (daytime), the temperature is 45 degrees.
   - At night, the temperature is 33 degrees, which is colder than the daytime temperature but warmer than the freezing point.

3. **Calculating the difference between the two temperatures**:
   - Difference = Night temperature - Daytime temperature
     = 33 degrees - 45 degrees
     = -12 degrees

4. **Determining how much heat needs to be added**:
   - Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees or lower, we need to add enough heat to raise the temperature above 32 degrees.
   - To find out how much heat needs to be added: 
     Heat needed = (Daytime temperature - Freezing point) / Heat per log
                = (45 degrees - 32 degrees) / 5 degrees/log
                = 13 degrees / 5 degrees/log
                = 2.6 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn approximately 2.6 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. Since he can't burn partial logs, he would need to round up to the nearest whole number. Hence, Carson should burn 3 logs to ensure the pipes don’t freeze. 

{The final answer is} 3 logs.<|im_end|>",4

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the discounted price of the jeans:**
   - The original price of the jeans is $40.
   - The discount is 25%.

2. **Subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:**

\[
\text{Sale Price} = \text{Original Price} - (\text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount}}{100})
\]

3. **Substitute the given values into the formula:**

\[
\text{Sale Price} = 40 - (40 \times \frac{25}{100})
\]

4. **Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:**

\[
\text{Sale Price} = 40 - (40 \times 0.25)
\]

5. **Perform the multiplication:**

\[
\text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10
\]

6. **Finally, perform the subtraction:**

\[
\text{Sale Price} = 30
\]

So, Mike will pay $30 for the jeans.

7. **Determine how much change Mike will receive from a $50 bill:**

\[
\text{Change} = \text{Amount Paid} - \text{Bill}
\]

8. **Substitute the known values:**

\[
\text{Change} = 30 - 50
\]

9. **Perform the subtraction:**

\[
\text{Change} = -20
\]

Since Mike cannot owe negative dollars, it means he does not have enough money in his pocket or has already used up more than what he had initially. Therefore, Mike does not have any money left over after paying for the jeans.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the initial conditions:**
   - Car A (first car) travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
   - Car B (second car) passes Car A at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.

2. **Determine the relative speed between the two cars:**
   - Since they are moving in the same direction, we need to calculate their relative speed.
   - Relative speed = Speed of Car B - Speed of Car A
   - Relative speed = 70 mph - 60 mph = 10 mph

3. **Calculate the distance covered by Car B in 2 hours:**
   - Distance = Relative speed × Time
   - Distance = 10 mph × 2 hours = 20 miles

4. **Calculate the distance covered by Car A in 2 hours:**
   - Distance = Speed of Car A × Time
   - Distance = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

5. **Find the difference in distance covered by the two cars:**
   - Difference in distance = Distance covered by Car B - Distance covered by Car A
   - Difference in distance = 20 miles - 120 miles = -100 miles

Since the negative value indicates that Car A has overtaken Car B, we can conclude that after 2 hours, Car A will be ahead of Car B by 100 miles.

To determine how many more tins of cat food Kimberly bought compared to dog food, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of cans for each type of pet food.
- **Cat Food**:
  - Kimberly has .8 packages of cat food.
  - Each package contains 11 tins.

  \[
  \text{Total cans for cat food} = 0.8 \times 11
  \]

  \[
  \text{Total cans for cat food} = 8.8 \text{ cans}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times taller Naruto's mountain is compared to Kagiyami's mountain, and then use that information to find out how many times taller Kagiyami's mountain is compared to Saskay's mountain. Finally, we will use that information to calculate how many times taller Saskay's mountain is compared to Pompei's mountain, and then convert that height into feet.

Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many times taller Naruto's mountain is compared to Kagiyami's mountain.
Naruto can lift a mountain \( M \) such that \( M = 10 \times \text{Kagiyami's mountain} \).

### Step 2: Determine how many times taller Kagiyami's mountain is compared to Saskay's mountain.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain \( K \) such that \( K = 4 \times \text{Saskay's mountain} \).

### Step 3: Determine how many times taller Saskay's mountain is compared to Pompei's mountain.
Saskay can lift a mountain \( S \) such that \( S = 12 \times \text{Pompei's mountain} \).

Given that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch tall, we have:
\[ S = 12 \times 1 = 12 \]

So, Saskay can lift a mountain that is \( 12 \) inches tall.

### Step 4: Calculate how many times taller Saskay's mountain is compared to Pompei's mountain.
Since Saskay's mountain is 12 inches tall and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch tall, we can set up the proportion:
\[ \frac{\text{Saskay's mountain}}{\text{Pompei's mountain}} = \frac{12}{1} \]
This means Saskay's mountain is \( 12 \) times taller than Pompei's mountain.

### Step 5: Convert Saskay's mountain height from inches to feet.
There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
\[ \text{Height in feet} = \frac{\text{Height in inches}}{12} = \frac{12}{12} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain that is **1** foot (or 12 inches) tall.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the current daily milk production:**
   - The farmer currently produces 5 liters of milk per cow.
   - He has 3 cows.
   - Therefore, his total daily milk production is \( 5 \text{ liters/cow} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \).

2. **Calculate the additional milk needed per cow:**
   - The goal is to increase the total daily milk production to 25 liters.
   - Current total milk production (per cow) = 15 liters/day.
   - Additional milk needed per cow = Total desired production - Current production = 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day.

3. **Determine the number of additional cows required:**
   - Each additional cow will contribute an extra 10 liters/day to the total milk production.
   - To achieve the desired total production of 25 liters/day, we divide the total desired production by the contribution per additional cow: 
     \[
     \frac{25 \text{ liters/day}}{10 \text{ liters/day per cow}} = 2.5 \text{ cows}
     \]
   - Since the number of cows must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number because partial cows aren't practical in this context.

Therefore, the farmer needs 3 more cows to reach his target of producing 25 liters of milk per day. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is that the farmer needs **3 more cows** to produce 25 liters of milk a day.<|im_end|>",2

                    question:
                    To make a profit of $2000, Isaias , has to sell the chickens he planned ! to take to the market ; from his farm at $50 : per . chicken. If Isaias has . 300 chickens ? on ! his farm and plans ? to sell 3/5 , of them, for how ? much money did Isaias buy the . chicken ; he took . to ? the market . for ! sale?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Determine the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:**
   - He has 300 chickens in total.
   - He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.

\[
\text{Number of chickens to be sold} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5}
\]

2. **Calculate the number of chickens to be sold:**

\[
300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180
\]

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

3. **Calculate the revenue from selling these chickens:**
   - Each chicken sells for $50.

\[
\text{Revenue} = 180 \times 50
\]

4. **Compute the revenue:**

\[
180 \times 50 = 9000
\]

Thus, Isaias will earn $9000 if he sells all 180 chickens.

5. **Determine the amount of money Isaias spent to buy the chickens:**
   - The cost of one chicken is $50.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 180 \times 50
\]

6. **Compute the total cost:**

\[
180 \times 50 = 9000
\]

Therefore, Isaias spent $9000 to buy the chickens before they were sold.

**Conclusion:**

Isaias bought the chickens for $9000 and intends to sell them for $9000 to make a profit of $2000. This calculation confirms that he will break even after accounting for the initial purchase cost. Thus, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate Carl's weight:**
   - Martin's weight = 55 kg
   - Carl's weight = 16 kg more than Martin's weight
     \[
     \text{Carl's weight} = 55 + 16 = 71 \text{ kg}
     \]

2. **Calculate Christian's weight:**
   - Carl's weight = 71 kg
   - Christian's weight = 8 kg more than Carl's weight
     \[
     \text{Christian's weight} = 71 + 8 = 79 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Calculate Harry's weight:**
   - Christian's weight = 79 kg
   - Harry's weight = 5 kg less than Christian's weight
     \[
     \text{Harry's weight} = 79 - 5 = 74 \text{ kg}
     \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is \(74\) kg.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Anis rowed compared to Dijana, then sum up their distances.

1. **Calculate Anis's rowing distance:**
   - Dijana rowed for 50 miles in one direction.
   - Anis rowed \( \frac{6}{5} \) times more than Dijana (since \( \frac{1}{5} \times 5 = 1 \), so \( \frac{6}{5} \times 1 = \frac{6}{5} \)).

2. **Determine Anis's rowing distance:**
   - Multiply Dijana’s distance by \( \frac{6}{5} \):
     \[
     \text{Anis's distance} = 50 \times \frac{6}{5}
     \]
   
3. **Simplify the calculation:**
   - Perform the multiplication:
     \[
     50 \times \frac{6}{5} = 50 \times 1.2 = 60 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Sum up the total distance:**
   - Add the distances rowed by both individuals:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \text{Anis's distance}
     \]
     
5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Summing the distances:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = 50 \text{ miles} + 60 \text{ miles} = 110 \text{ miles}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total number of pieces of bologna thrown**:
   Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna.

2. **Determine the number of pieces thrown per color**:
   - Red balloons: Each red balloon received 2 pieces.
   - Yellow balloons: Each yellow balloon received 3 pieces.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces thrown for each color**:
   - Let \( R \) be the number of red balloons.
   - Let \( Y \) be the number of yellow balloons.
   
   From the information given:
   \[
   2R + 3Y = 58
   \]

4. **Use the total number of balloons equation**:
   The total number of balloons is:
   \[
   R + Y = 20
   \]

5. **Solve the system of equations**:
   We have two equations:
   \[
   2R + 3Y = 58
   \]
   \[
   R + Y = 20
   \]

6. **Isolate one variable from one equation to substitute into another**:
   From the second equation, we can express \( R \):
   \[
   R = 20 - Y
   \]

7. **Substitute \( R \) into the first equation**:
   Substitute \( R = 20 - Y \) into \( 2R + 3Y = 58 \):
   \[
   2(20 - Y) + 3Y = 58
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   40 - 2Y + 3Y = 58
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   40 + Y = 58
   \]
   Solve for \( Y \):
   \[
   Y = 58 - 40
   \]
   \[
   Y = 18

So, there were 18 yellow balloons in the bundle. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of bottles of apple juice given to students.**

- There are 29 pupils.
- Each pupil receives 2 bottles of apple juice.

\[ \text{Total bottles for students} = 29 \times 2 = 58 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of bottles that can be redeemed from the coupons.**

- Each coupon can be used to redeem 100 bottles of apple juice.
- The teacher has 9 coupons.

\[ \text{Total bottles from coupons} = 9 \times 100 = 900 \]

**Step 3: Find out how much apple juice is left after distributing to students and redeeming coupons.**

- Total bottles available initially (from coupons) - Bottles already distributed (to students)

\[ \text{Remaining bottles} = 900 - 58 = 842 \]

**Step 4: Confirm the remaining bottles match the initial total since no other usage or deductions were mentioned.**

Given that we've accounted for all transactions and there are no additional constraints on what happens next, we conclude that the remaining bottles will indeed be exactly those calculated above.

                    question:
                    Pamela reapplies ? an ? ounce of : sunscreen every , hour she's ? outside. ?  Her , sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles.  While , on vacation, ? if she will be outside 4 hours a day over 8 days, . how ! many bottles of sunscreen will she need to : pack?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs for her trip, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Determine the total amount of sunscreen Pamela uses per hour:**
   - She applies 1/20th of an ounce (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour).
   
2. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used during the vacation:**
   - Over 8 days, she spends 4 hours outside each day.
   - Total time spent outside = 8 days * 4 hours/day = 32 hours.

3. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over 32 hours:**
   - Sunscreen used per hour * Total hours outside = \( \frac{1}{20} \times 32 \) ounces.

Let's do the calculation:

\[
\frac{1}{20} \times 32 = \frac{32}{20} = 1.6 \text{ ounces}
\]

So, Pamela uses 1.6 ounces of sunscreen in total over the course of her vacation.

4. **Determine how many bottles of sunscreen are needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
   - Number of bottles needed = Total ounces / Ounces per bottle.

Now, we calculate the number of bottles:

\[
\frac{1.6}{8} = 0.2 \text{ bottles}
\]

Since Pamela cannot purchase a fraction of a bottle, she would need to round up to ensure she has enough sunscreen. Therefore, she would need to pack 1 full bottle plus any additional necessary bottles.

5. **Check if more bottles are required beyond the initial calculation:**

Since the result indicates that only one full bottle is needed, it seems that Pamela might not require any extra bottles as she can use the entire bottle without needing to buy another one.

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} 1 bottle of sunscreen.<|im_end|>",4

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Adrianne's initial collection**:
   - She received 20 metallic beads from her mother.
   
2. **Sister's contribution**:
   - Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother.
   - Mother gave 20 beads.
   - Sister gives: \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.

3. **Friend's contribution**:
   - Friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother.
   - Mother gave 20 beads.
   - Friend gives: \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Now we add all these contributions together:

- From Adrianne's mother: 20 beads
- From Adrianne's sister: 30 beads
- From her friend: 40 beads

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total distance between San Diego, California and New York City:**
   - We know that it is approximately 1955 kilometers.

2. **Calculate the average daily driving distance based on the given information about Bernice's journey:**
   - Bernice drove 325 kilometers in 4 days.
   
3. **Divide the total distance by the number of days to find the average daily driving distance:**

\[
\text{Average daily driving distance} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Number of days}}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Average daily driving distance} = \frac{325 \text{ km}}{4 \text{ days}} = 81.25 \text{ km/day}
\]

So, Bernice drives an average of 81.25 kilometers per day.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive:**
   - Subtract the total distance already driven from the total distance between the two cities.

\[
\text{Remaining distance} = \text{Total distance} - (\text{Average daily driving distance} \times \text{Number of days})
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Remaining distance} = 1955 \text{ km} - (81.25 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days})

Perform the multiplication first:

\[
81.25 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 325 \text{ km}

                    question:
                    Mr ! Hezekiah ! had , 20 ! trucks from his . store supplying fertiliser to different farmers in ; his ; hometown dispatched ? for . delivery on ! a particular day.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of trucks dispatched:**
   - Mr. Hezekiah has 20 trucks.
   
2. **Calculate the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures:**
   - According to the problem, two-thirds of the trucks experienced mechanical failures.
   - Number of trucks with mechanical failures = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 20\)

Let's perform the calculation:

\[ 
\frac{2}{3} \times 20 = \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33 \text{ trucks}
\]

Since you can't have a fraction of a truck, let's assume it's rounded down (as trucks must be whole numbers):

Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 13 trucks.

3. **Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered their load:**
   - Successful deliveries = Total trucks - Trucks with mechanical failures
   - Successful deliveries = \(20 - 13\)
   - Successful deliveries = 7 trucks

4. **Calculate the total amount of fertilizer carried by the successful deliveries:**
   - Each truck carries 20 tons of fertilizer.
   - Total tons delivered = Successful deliveries * Tons per truck

So, 

Total tons delivered = \(7 \times 20\)
= 140 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertilizer that reached the farmers' fields on that day is 140 tons.<|im_end|>",300

                    question:
                    James decided to walk to the store.  When he ? got halfway ! there , he ! realized he forgot ; something at home and had : to walk back. .  If his . home is 4 miles from the store : and he walks ! 4 miles per hour ! how : long ! did it take . him to reach the . store?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down James' journey into steps:

1. **Determine the total distance from home to the store:**
   - James' home is 4 miles away from the store.

2. **Calculate the time taken to travel half the distance (halfway point):**
   - Half the distance between home and the store is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
   - James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
   - Time taken to travel 2 miles = \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles/hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Calculate the remaining distance after reaching the halfway point:**
   - After reaching the halfway point, James has another 2 miles left to go.

4. **Calculate the time taken to return home:**
   - Since James walked back home, which is also 4 miles in one direction, the time taken for the return trip is the same as the initial half-trip.
   - Time taken to walk back home = \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles/hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \).

5. **Add up all the times to get the total time taken:**
   - Total time taken = Time to reach halfway + Time to return home
   - Total time taken = \( 0.5 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \).

So, the final answer is: {The final answer is}. It took James 1.5 hours to reach the store.<|im_end|>",2

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the weight of Kory's dog:**
   - We are given that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

2. **Calculate the weight of Elijah's first dog:**
   - Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog.
   - Therefore, the weight of Elijah's first dog = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 60 \) pounds.
   - Calculating this gives us: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \) pounds.

3. **Calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog:**
   - Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog.
   - Therefore, the weight of Elijah's second dog = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 60 \) pounds.
   - Calculating this gives us: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \) pounds.

4. **Sum up the weights of both Elijah's dogs:**
   - The total weight of Elijah's dogs = weight of Elijah's first dog + weight of Elijah's second dog.
   - Calculating this gives us: \( 15 + 30 = 45 \) pounds.

5. **Add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:**
   - Total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs = weight of Elijah's dogs + weight of Kory's dog.
   - Calculating this gives us: \( 45 + 60 = 105 \) pounds.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to break down his carrot intake for both weekdays and weekends.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday)**:
   - He eats 4 carrots each day.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Total carrots eaten during weekdays = \(4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots}\).

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday)**:
   - He eats 5 carrots each day.
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - Total carrots eaten during weekends = \(5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots}\).

3. **Total Carrots Eaten in a Week**:
   - Add the carrots eaten on weekdays and weekends together.
   - Total carrots = \(20 \text{ carrots (weekdays)} + 10 \text{ carrots (weekends)} = 30 \text{ carrots}\).

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the initial situation
- Doxa has eaten one slice.
- Her sister eats more than she (which means she eats two slices).
- The brother eats more than his sister (which means he eats three slices).

### Step 2: Calculate how many slices were left after the first person ate
Doxa ate 1 slice, so there are \(8 - 1 = 7\) slices remaining.

### Step 3: Determine how many slices were eaten by the second person
Her sister ate 2 slices, so there are \(7 - 2 = 5\) slices remaining.

### Step 4: Determine how many slices were eaten by the third person
The brother ate 3 slices, so there are \(5 - 3 = 2\) slices remaining.

### Step 5: Sum up the total number of slices eaten
Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 2 slices.
The brother ate 3 slices.

Total slices eaten = \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\)

                    question:
                    Mia . and Emma are currently , 16 years . apart in age. If ! Mia, . who , is younger , than ? Emma, is 40 years old, what's the average of their ages?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the current age difference between Mia and Emma.
2. Calculate the total number of years since they were born.
3. Find out how many years have passed for each person.
4. Compute the average age.

Step 1: The current age difference between Mia and Emma is given as 16 years.

Step 2: We know that Emma is currently 40 years old. Therefore, 16 years ago, Emma was \(40 - 16 = 24\) years old.

Step 3: Since Mia is younger now, let's find out when Mia was older than Emma. Let's denote the year when Mia was 16 years older than Emma as \(Y\). At that time, Emma would be \(Y + 16\) years old, and Mia would be \(Y\) years old. We can set up an equation based on their ages at that point in time:

\[Y + 16 = 40\]

Solving for \(Y\):

\[Y = 40 - 16 = 24\]

So, 24 years ago, Mia was 16 years older than Emma. This means that Mia is 24 years older than Emma.

Step 4: Now, let's calculate the average age of Mia and Emma. Both of them will be \(24 + 16 = 40\) years old after 24 years from the point where Mia was 16 years older than Emma. 

The average age is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average Age} = \frac{\text{Total Sum of Ages}}{\text{Number of People}}
\]

Here, the total sum of ages is \(40 + 40 = 80\), and there are two people (Mia and Emma).

Therefore, the average age is:

\[
\text{Average Age} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
\]

Thus, the average age of Mia and Emma is **40**.<|im_end|>",48

   - John has 3 children.
   - He buys 2 pairs of shoes per child.
   
   \[
   \text{Total pairs of shoes} = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

2. **Determine the cost per pair of shoes:**
   - Each pair of shoes costs $60.

3. **Calculate the total amount paid for all the shoes:**
   - Number of pairs × Cost per pair
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6 \times \$60 = \$360

To determine how much change Violetta will receive after her purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the crayons:**
   - Violetta wants 5 different colors.
   - Each crayon costs $2.

   Therefore, the total cost = number of colors × cost per color
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 5 \times \$2 = \$10
   \]

2. **Subtract the total cost from the amount Violetta has prepared:**
   - Violetta has $20 available for the purchase.

   To find the change, subtract the total cost from the amount Violetta has:
   \[
   \text{Change} = \$20 - \$10 = \$10

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of participants:**
   - According to the information provided, there were 20 people in total.

2. **Calculate the number of people John beat:**
   - The problem states that John beats 80% of the time.
   - To find out how many people he beat, we need to calculate 80% of 20.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of people beaten} = 20 \times \frac{80}{100}
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   
   \[
   \text{Number of people beaten} = 20 \times 0.8 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of people John lost to:**
   - Since all participants either beat or lost to someone else, we can subtract the number of people who beat him from the total number of participants.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of people lost to} = 20 - (\text{Number of people beaten})
   \]
   Substituting the value calculated earlier:

Given that a magazine costs half as much as a book, we know from the information provided that the book costs $4.

\[
\text{Cost of the book} = \$4
\]

Since a magazine costs half as much as the book,

\[
\text{Cost of the magazine} = \frac{\$4}{2} = \$2

### Step 2: Determine the cost of the pen
We're told that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine.

\[
\text{Cost of the pen} = \text{Cost of the magazine} - \$1

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the value of the faulty pieces of equipment:**
   - The total value of the equipment purchased is $400,000.
   - The percentage of the total that is faulty is 40%.
   - Therefore, the value of the faulty pieces is \( 40\% \) of $400,000.

\[ \text{Value of faulty pieces} = 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

2. **Calculate the value of the non-faulty pieces of equipment:**
   - Subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total value to find the value of the non-faulty pieces.

\[ \text{Value of non-faulty pieces} = 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

3. **Determine how many pieces of equipment were returned:**
   - We know that 40% of the total number of pieces was faulty.
   - This means that 60% of the total number of pieces (since 100% - 40% = 60%) were not faulty.
   - Let \( N \) be the total number of pieces. Then, \( 0.60N \) represents the number of pieces that were not faulty.

4. **Calculate the number of pieces returned:**
   - Since all the faulty pieces are returned, we need to find out how many pieces correspond to the faulty ones.
   - Given that 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, return these pieces.

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces:**
   - The value of the non-faulty pieces is already calculated as $240,000.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Amount in Bank Account**: Sally's bank account started the week with $200.
   - Initial amount = $200.

2. **Final Amount in Bank Account**: At the end of the week, her bank account holds $420.
   - Final amount = $420.

3. **Total Increase in Bank Account**: The total increase in the bank account can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = \text{Final amount} - \text{Initial amount}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 420 - 200 = 220
   \]

4. **Weekly Wage Calculation**: According to the problem, if her weekly wage should be $300, then we need to determine how much was withheld from her wage.
   - Let \( W \) represent the amount withheld from her wage.
   
5. **Relationship Between Total Increase and Weekly Wage**: We know that the total increase in the bank account ($220) represents the difference between what Sally actually received (her wage) and what she was supposed to receive (her weekly wage).
   - Therefore,
     \[
     \text{Actual Received Wage} - \text{Supposed Weekly Wage} = \text{Withheld Wage}
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \text{Withheld Wage} = 220 - 300 = -80
     \]

Since it doesn't make sense for a negative number to be withheld, let's re-evaluate our approach. It appears there might have been an error in interpreting the relationship or the initial setup. 

6. **Revisiting the Problem Statement**:
   - Sally received $300 but ended up with only $420 in her bank account after subtracting whatever was withheld.
   - This means she received less than $300.

Given these steps, the correct interpretation should be that Sally received $280 instead of $300 because the actual wage she received is less than the expected wage due to withholding.

Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally's wage is:

                    question:
                    Mike's , teacher, leaves as homework the reading of ? a ! 200-page book. The : assignment is ! to ! be : completed within 30 days. Mike ; plans to read 10 ? pages a day. How many ? days before ; the deadline will Mike finish his reading?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish reading the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days available for reading:**
   - The total time given is 30 days.

2. **Determine the total number of pages in the book:**
   - The book has 200 pages.

3. **Find out how many pages Mike reads per day:**
   - Mike plans to read 10 pages per day.

4. **Calculate the total number of days it takes Mike to read the entire book:**
   \[
   \text{Total days} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total days} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days}
   \]

5. **Subtract the total number of days Mike needs from the total available days:**
   \[
   \text{Days before deadline} = \text{Total available days} - \text{Total days needed}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Days before deadline} = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days}
   \]

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.<|im_end|>",10
"Sarah’s basketball games are 4 ; quarters , that are ; each 12 minutes long. In ; the last ; quarter, ; there was a : tie so the game was extended ? for five minutes. How long ! did the ! entire game last?","<|im_start|>system

                    question:
                    Sarah’s basketball games are 4 ; quarters , that are ; each 12 minutes long. In ; the last ; quarter, ; there was a : tie so the game was extended ? for five minutes. How long ! did the ! entire game last?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine the total length of Sarah's basketball game, we need to consider both the standard duration of her games and any additional time added due to an extension.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of quarters in a full game:**
   - Each game consists of 4 quarters.
   
2. **Calculate the total duration without extensions:**
   - Since each quarter lasts 12 minutes,
     \[
     \text{Total time without extensions} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Account for the extra time added due to the extension:**
   - The game was extended by 5 minutes.
  
4. **Sum up all the durations to find the total game time:**
   - Total game time includes the original 48 minutes plus the 5-minute extension.
     \[
     \text{Total game time} = 48 + 5 = 53 \text{ minutes}
     \]

### Final Answer:
The entire game lasted \(53\) minutes.<|im_end|>",53

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Cookies**: Susan initially made 100 cookies.

2. **Cookies Snuck Away**: Her husband snuck away 4 cookies.

3. **Calculate Remaining Cookies**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Cookies} = \text{Initial Cookies} - \text{Snuck Away Cookies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining Cookies} = 100 - 4 = 96
   \]

4. **Divide Cookies Equally Among Nephews**:
   Susan has 6 nephews.
   
   To find out how many cookies each nephew gets, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews.
   
   \[
   \text{Cookies per Nephew} = \frac{\text{Remaining Cookies}}{\text{Number of Nephews}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cookies per Nephew} = \frac{96}{6} = 16
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   Each of Susan's nephews will receive 16 cookies.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>",16

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Sloth’s Trip:**
   - The sloth needs 4 hours for one complete round trip (up and down).
   - He collects berries during the trip down.
   - We need to find out how many berries he can collect in an 8-hour period.

2. **Determine the Rate at Which the Sloth Collects Berries:**
   - Since he makes one complete round trip in 4 hours, we first calculate his rate of collecting berries per hour.
   - In 4 hours, he collects berries from the top of the tree to the bottom and then climbs back up. 
     \[
     \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Total number of berries}}{\text{Time taken}}
     \]
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of berries collected in one trip (down and up). So,
     \[
     x = \text{berries collected down} + \text{berries collected up}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Time Needed for One Trip Down:**
   - If he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, he must determine how many berries he collects per trip down.
   - We know that the time needed for one complete trip (up and down) is 4 hours.
   - Therefore, the time needed for one trip down would be half of this (since he doesn't have to return up):
     \[
     \text{Time needed for one trip down} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Number of Berries Collected per Trip Down:**
   - Given that he has 8 hours to collect 24 berries in total, and he spends 2 hours collecting berries while going down, we can calculate the number of berries he collects per trip down as follows:
     \[
     \text{Berries collected per trip down} = \frac{24}{8} = 3 \text{ berries}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure our calculation is correct, we check if he can indeed collect 3 berries per trip down within the given constraints.
   - If he does so, then in 2 hours, he will collect \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) berries.
   - After collecting these berries, he returns up the tree, which also takes him 2 hours.
   - Thus, he completes one full trip (up and down) in 4 hours, and after 8 hours, he has completed two trips (down and up).

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to reach 24 berries in 8 hours is **3**.<|im_end|>",12

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how fast the faster car goes, let's break down the information given:

1. **Average Car Speed**: 
   - The average car can go 120 miles per hour.

2. **2nd Fastest Car**:
   - The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   
3. **Faster Car**:
   - The faster car is 1.25 times as fast as the 2nd fastest car.

Now, we will calculate the speed of the faster car using these relationships.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. Calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car:
   \[
   \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph}
   \]

2. Calculate the speed of the faster car based on its relationship to the 2nd fastest car:
   \[
   \text{Speed of faster car} = 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph}
   \]

Therefore, the faster car can go at a speed of **750 miles per hour**.<|im_end|>",750

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of face masks Tyrion uses per day:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask twice every time he goes out.
   - He goes out three times a day.

   Therefore, the total number of face masks he uses per day is:
   \[
   \text{Face masks per day} = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of face masks used over 2 days:**
   - We need to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days.

   Since he uses 6 face masks per day, for 2 days:
   \[
   \text{Face masks in 2 days} = 6 \times 2 = 12

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sheep each city has based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

1. **Identify the number of sheep in Seattle:**
   - We are told that Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Determine the number of sheep in Charleston:**
   - According to the information, Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Since Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:
     \[
     \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80
     \]

3. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - The problem states that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - We already calculated that Charleston has 80 sheep, so:
     \[
     \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160
     \]

4. **Sum the total number of sheep:**
   - To find the total number of sheep among Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we add their individual counts:
     \[
     \text{Total Sheep} = \text{Sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Seattle}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine how much sauce Freda makes from one can of tomatoes:**
   - Each can has a volume of 16 ounces.
   - The total volume of sauce made from one can is given as 32 ounces.

2. **Calculate how many cans of tomatoes are needed to make 32 ounces of sauce:**
   - Since 1 can produces 32 ounces of sauce, Freda needs only 1 can for her current recipe.

3. **Calculate how many tomatoes are in one can:**
   - Freda uses 3 cans of tomatoes per batch.
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used in the current batch:**
   - Since Freda uses 3 cans, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
     \[
     3 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 9 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

5. **Verify the consistency with the volume loss information:**
   - Canned tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - If the original volume was 16 ounces, after cooking, it would be reduced to 8 ounces (half).
   - This matches the information provided about the sauce losing half its volume when mixed with tomatoes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Susan earns from her online tasks, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total time Susan spends working.
- Susan starts at 8:00 a.m.
- She works until 11:00 a.m.
- Total work time = 3 hours (from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.)

### Step 2: Convert the work time into minutes.
- Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of intervals during which Susan works.
- The problem states that she takes a 30-minute break after working for 10 minutes.
- Number of breaks = \( \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} - 1 \) (subtracting 1 because the last interval doesn't end at 11:00)
\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \]
\[ 18 - 1 = 17 \] 

So, she has 17 intervals.

### Step 4: Calculate the total duration of one complete cycle (work + break).
- One complete cycle = Work time + Break time
\[ 10 \text{ minutes (work)} + 30 \text{ minutes (break)} = 40 \text{ minutes per cycle} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of cycles.
- Total number of cycles = Number of breaks = 17

### Step 6: Calculate the total amount earned.
- Amount earned per cycle = \$5
- Total amount earned = Total number of cycles × Amount earned per cycle
\[ 17 \times 5 = 85 \]

Therefore, Susan earns a total of **\$85** for the online tasks over the given period.<|im_end|>",75

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - If she buys 2 packs, she gets 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

2. **Calculate the total cost before discounts:**
   - The cost per pack is $4.00.
   - For 2 packs, the total cost would be 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

3. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" promotion:**
   - With this promotion, she only pays for half of her purchase.
   - Therefore, she effectively pays for 5 razors (since she gets 1 free).

4. **Subtract the coupons:**
   - She has a $2.00 coupon that can be applied to any item.
   - Since she's buying 5 razors, we'll subtract $2.00 from the total cost.

Let's do the math now:

- Total cost without discount: $8.00
- Apply the $2.00 coupon: $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00

Now, since she bought 8 razors but paid only for 5, she should receive 3 additional razors for free. However, she already got all 8 razors at full price, so there's no need to apply any further coupons or promotions.

Final answer: Each individual razor costs **$1.00** after the discount.<|im_end|>",25

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Determine the ratio between onions and potatoes that Rose bought.
Rose bought 4 times as many onions as Sophia. We know that Rose bought 12 onions.

So, if \( O \) represents the number of onions Sophia bought and \( R \) represents the number of onions Rose bought (which is given as 12), we can write:
\[ O = \frac{R}{4} \]

Substitute \( R = 12 \):
\[ O = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ O = 3 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions.

Step 2: Determine the number of potatoes Sophia bought based on the ratio.
Since Rose bought 4 times as many potatoes as Sophia, and Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let \( P \) represent the number of potatoes Sophia bought. So,
\[ P = \frac{R}{4} \]

Substitute \( R = 12 \):
\[ P = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ P = 3 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 potatoes.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.
Sophia bought 3 onions and 3 potatoes, so the total quantity she bought is:
\[ Total = O + P \]
\[ Total = 3 + 3 \]

                    question:
                    A , cat eats nine sausages in 30 ! minutes. A dog can ! eat the same number ? of sausages in ? 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes. Calculate ? the . average time : the two , take : the : eat the sausages.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages:**
   - The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages.
   - Therefore, the rate at which the cat eats sausages is \( \frac{9}{30} = \frac{3}{10} \) sausages per minute.

2. **Calculate how many sausages the dog can eat in one minute:**
   - Since the dog eats the same number of sausages as the cat but in less time, let's denote the time the dog takes to eat all 9 sausages as \( T_d \).
   - The dog's eating rate should be proportional to the time taken by the cat since they both eat the same number of sausages.

3. **Set up the proportion based on the rates:**
   - Let \( R_d \) be the rate at which the dog eats sausages.
   - According to the problem, the dog eats the same number of sausages as the cat but in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the cat's time.
   - So, \( R_d = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{10} = \frac{6}{30} = \frac{1}{5} \) sausages per minute (since the rate is inversely proportional to the time).

4. **Calculate the total time the dog takes to eat 9 sausages:**
   - If the dog eats at a rate of \( \frac{1}{5} \) sausages per minute, then the time \( T_d \) it takes to eat 9 sausages is \( T_d = \frac{9}{\frac{1}{5}} = 9 \times 5 = 45 \) minutes.

5. **Calculate the average time:**
   - The average time for both cats and dogs is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Average Time} = \frac{T_c + T_d}{2} = \frac{30 + 45}{2} = \frac{75}{2} = 37.5 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the average time that both cats and dogs take to eat the sausages is 37.5 minutes.<|im_end|>",25

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of notebooks Martha initially had:**
   - Let \( M \) represent the number of notebooks Martha initially had.
   - According to the problem, after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has a total of 7 notebooks.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     M + 5 = 7
     \]
   - Solving for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 7 - 5 = 2
     \]

2. **Calculate how many notebooks Joseph has:**
   - The problem states that Joseph has ""3 times as many notebooks as Martha"".
   - Since Martha initially had 2 notebooks, we calculate:
     \[
     3 \times 2 = 6
     \]
   - So, Joseph has 6 notebooks.

3. **Determine how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph:**
   - Martha has a total of 7 notebooks.
   - Joseph has 6 notebooks.
   - To find out how many more notebooks Martha has:
     \[
     7 - 6 = 1
     \]

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To determine how much the class was able to raise from the sale of lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling lollipops.
- Each student sells on average 10 lollipops.
- The price of each lollipop is $0.8.

First, calculate the revenue per student:
\[ \text{Revenue per student} = 10 \times \$0.8 = \$8 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue for all 30 students:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 30 \times \$8 = \$240 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
- The price of each lollipop is $0.5.

Calculate the total cost for all 30 students:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 30 \times \$0.5 = \$15 \]

### Step 3: Determine the profit made from selling the lollipops.
Subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Profit} = \$240 - \$15 = \$225 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{\$225}\) from the sale of lollipops.<|im_end|>",90

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of movies watched on both days:**
   - On Saturday, Jill watches 4 movies.
   - On Sunday, she watches half the number of movies as on Saturday.

2. **Calculate the total number of movies watched over these two days:**
   - Number of movies on Saturday = 4
   - Number of movies on Sunday = \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \)
   - Total for both days = \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies per week.

3. **Find out how many movies they watch during one whole weekend (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - They watch 6 movies each weekend.

4. **Determine how many weekends there will be in 4 weeks:**
   - Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, there will be \( \frac{4}{1} = 4 \) weekends.

5. **Calculate the total number of movies watched over 4 weeks:**
   - Movies watched per weekend = 6
   - Number of weekends in 4 weeks = 4
   - Total movies watched in 4 weeks = \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \).

To determine how much money Raymond has left after his transactions, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine how much money Raymond initially had**
Raymond started with $21.

**Step 2: Calculate how much Raymond saved**
Raymond saved $11 from his allowance.

**Step 3: Subtract the amount saved from the initial amount**
$21 - $11 = $10

After saving, Raymond has $10 left.

**Step 4: Calculate how much Raymond spent on the comic book**
Raymond spent $5 on a comic book.

**Step 5: Subtract the cost of the comic book from what he has left**
$10 - $5 = $5

After buying the comic book, Raymond has $5 left.

**Step 6: Calculate how much Raymond spent on the puzzle**
Raymond spent another $19 on a puzzle.

**Step 7: Subtract the cost of the puzzle from what he has left**
$5 - $19 = -$14

Since Raymond cannot owe negative amounts, this indicates that he doesn't have enough money left in his pocket to buy the puzzle. Therefore, he would be short by $14.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Polly can stand from the dragon while throwing the javelin and still be within the range of the dragon's flames.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Polly can throw the javelin a maximum distance of 400 feet.
   - When holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times as far as without the gemstone.
   
2. **Calculate the additional distance when holding the gemstone:**
   - Without the gemstone, the maximum distance is 400 feet.
   - With the gemstone, Polly can throw it three times further, so \(3 \times 400 = 1200\) feet.

3. **Determine the maximum safe distance from the dragon:**
   - The dragon's flames have a range of 1000 feet.
   - Therefore, Polly must stay at least 1000 feet away from the dragon.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance if holding the gemstone:**
   - Since Polly can throw the javelin up to 1200 feet with the gemstone,
     the maximum safe distance is \(1200 - 1000 = 200\) feet.

5. **Check if holding the gemstone keeps Polly inside the dragon’s flames:**
   - Holding the gemstone allows her to throw the javelin up to 1200 feet.
   - This distance is well beyond the dragon's flames (1000 feet).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Polly cannot hold the gemstone because it would allow her to throw the javelin too far into the dragon's flames, which she cannot do.
   
### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} 200 feet. Polly cannot hold the gemstone and still keep the javelin within the dragon's flames; therefore, she cannot stand more than 200 feet away.<|im_end|>",200

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of days for the car journey:**
   - The total time for the trip is 6 days.
   - Half of these days (by car) can be calculated as \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

2. **Calculate the number of days for the bus journey:**
   - Since the bus journey takes the same amount of time as the car journey, we already know that the bus journey also takes 3 days.

3. **Determine the total time spent traveling:**
   - We have already accounted for the 6 days (total trip time).
   - Subtract the bus journey time (3 days) from the total trip time: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) days remaining after the bus journey.

4. **Account for the return journey:**
   - If Andrew wants to return via car, he would need another 3 days (same as the initial car journey).

5. **Sum up all the days needed:**
   - Bus journey to Rochester: 3 days
   - Return journey by car: 3 days

Therefore, the total number of days Andrew will travel is \( 3 + 3 = 6 \) days.

**Final Answer:** He will travel for 6 days in total.<|im_end|>",9

Dale wants to sell a total of **250** candies.

### Step 2: Calculate how many candies Dale has already sold.
Dale has sold **150** candies so far.

### Step 3: Subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies Dale wants to sell.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years it took Bill to see the comet for the first time after seeing it last. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the total number of years between Bill's two sightings:**
   - Bill saw the comet at age \(x\).
   - His father saw the comet at age 30.
   - The difference in their ages is \(x - 30\).

2. **Find out how long it takes Bill to see the comet again:**
   - We know that Comet Halley completes one orbit around the Sun every 75 years.
   - Since Bill saw the comet again, it must have been 75 years since his previous sighting.

3. **Calculate the total number of years between Bill's two sightings:**
   - If the total number of years between these two sightings is 75 years, then the age difference between Bill and his father at the time of the first sighting (\(x - 30\)) plus the 75-year interval equals 75 years.
   \[
   x - 30 + 75 = 75

   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   x + 45 = 75

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of dogs
Bernie has 4 dogs.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of walking needed for all dogs combined
Each dog walks a specific number of miles per day:
- First dog: 1 mile/day
- Second dog: 4 miles/day
- Third dog: 3 miles/day

Let \( x \) be the number of miles the fourth dog needs to walk per day.

We know that on average, they need to walk **3** miles per day. Therefore:
\[ \frac{1 + 4 + 3 + x}{4} = 3 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
First, simplify the equation:
\[ \frac{8 + x}{4} = 3 \]

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many marbles Paul has after receiving more from his friend.
Paul initially had 52 marbles. He received 28 more marbles from his friend.

\[ \text{Total marbles} = 52 + 28 \]

Let's calculate that first:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

So, Paul now has 80 marbles.

### Step 2: Calculate how many marbles Paul loses.
Paul then loses one-fourth (1/4) of his total marbles.

\[ \text{Marbles lost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

So, Paul loses 20 marbles.

### Step 3: Subtract the number of lost marbles from the initial total to find out how many marbles Paul has left.
Now we subtract the 20 marbles that were lost from the 80 marbles Paul originally had:

\[ \text{Remaining marbles} = 80 - 20 \]

Let's do the subtraction:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, Paul has **60** marbles left.

   \text{Microphones not fitting} = \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) \times \text{Total microphones} = \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) \times 50 = 10
   \]

4. **Subtract the number of microphones not fitting from the total number of microphones to find those that do fit:**
   
   \[
   \text{Pairs of microphones fitting} = \text{Total pairs} - \text{Microphones not fitting}
   \]
   
   Substituting the values we have calculated:
   
   \[
   \text{Pairs of microphones fitting} = 25 - 10 = 15
   \]

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 15 pairs of microphones on the stage. 

**The final answer is:**

<|im_start|>super
Let's break down this problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of people who arrived in the morning (10:00)
- Initially, 50 people arrived at 10:00 AM.
- At noon, 40 more people arrived.

Total number of people in the morning = 50 + 40 = **90** people.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of people who arrived after noon
- Twice the number of people who arrived at 10:00 came in after noon.
- Therefore, 2 * 90 = **180** people arrived after noon.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of people who arrived during the entire day
- Morning arrival: 90 people.
- Afternoon arrival: 180 people.
- Total arrivals throughout the day = 90 + 180 = **270** people.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of people who arrived later than noon
- Three times the number of people who arrived at 10:00 came in later.
- Therefore, 3 * 90 = **270** people arrived later.

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of people who arrived throughout the day
- Total arrivals from 10:00 AM onwards = 270 people (morning) + 270 people (later) = **540** people.

### Conclusion
The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is **540**.<|im_end|>",320
": A ; fruit ! vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. : He sold all of them at ; a profit of 25%. ? How much was , each watermelon sold?","<|im_start|>system

                    question:
                    : A ; fruit ! vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. : He sold all of them at ; a profit of 25%. ? How much was , each watermelon sold?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The vendor spent $80 on 50 watermelons.

2. **Determine the selling price per watermelon without considering profit:**
   - Let \( P \) be the selling price per watermelon.
   - Since there is a profit of 25%, the selling price should cover both the cost and the profit (which is 25% of the cost).

3. **Express the relationship between the selling price and the cost:**
   - If we assume that the selling price includes only the cost plus 25% profit, then the selling price per watermelon can be represented as:
     \[
     P = C + 0.25C = 1.25C
     \]
     where \( C \) is the original cost per watermelon.

4. **Find the total revenue from selling all watermelons:**
   - The total revenue from selling 50 watermelons would be:
     \[
     R_{total} = 50P
     \]

5. **Relate the total revenue to the number of watermelons and the selling price per watermelon:**
   - We know the total revenue equals the sum of the costs and profits, which means:
     \[
     R_{total} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
     \]

6. **Solve for the selling price per watermelon:**
   - Substitute the expression for \( P \) back into the equation:
     \[
     50P = 100
     \]
     Solving for \( P \):
     \[
     P = \frac{100}{50} = 2
     \]

Therefore, each watermelon sold is worth $2.

**Final Answer:** Each watermelon sold is worth $\boxed{2}$.<|im_end|>",2

<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many slices each person can have, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pizza slices:**
   - There are 7 pizzas.
   - Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices is \(7 \times 8 = 56\).

2. **Determine the total number of people sharing the pizzas:**
   - Henry and his 3 friends make a total of \(4\) people.

3. **Divide the total number of slices by the total number of people:**
   - We divide the total number of slices (56) by the total number of people (4).
   - This gives us \( \frac{56}{4} = 14 \).

So, each person can have 14 slices.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Let's break down this problem into steps:

1. **Initial Typing Speed**: Jared starts at 47 words per minute.
2. **Speed Increase**: After some lessons, his typing speed increases to 52 words per minute.
3. **Next Increase**: Jared plans to increase his typing speed again by 5 words per minute.

Now let's calculate the new typing speeds after each increment:

**Step 1: Calculate the first increase**
- Initial speed = 47 WPM
- Increase in speed = 5 WPM
- New speed after first increase = 47 + 5 = 52 WPM

**Step 2: Calculate the second increase**
- Current speed = 52 WPM
- Increase in speed = 5 WPM
- New speed after second increase = 52 + 5 = 57 WPM

So, after increasing his typing speed twice, Jared's typing speed becomes 57 words per minute.

**Step 3: Calculate the average of the three measurements**

To find the average, we need to add up all the speeds and divide by the number of measurements.

- Total speed = 47 (initial) + 52 (first increase) + 57 (second increase)
- Average speed = Total speed / Number of measurements

Substituting in the values:

\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{156}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average speed} = 52 \text{ WPM} \]

Therefore, the average of the three measurements will be 52 words per minute.<|im_end|>",52

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total weight capacity of the elevator:**
   - The elevator has a maximum load of 700 kg.

2. **Calculate the total number of people in the elevator:**
   - There are 1 (Jack) + 8 others = 9 people.

3. **Calculate the total weight of these 9 people:**
   - Each person weighs approximately 80 kg.
   - Total weight for 9 people = \( 9 \times 80 \) kg = 720 kg.

4. **Compare the total weight to the elevator's maximum load:**
   - Elevator's maximum load: 700 kg.
   - Weight of 9 people: 720 kg.

5. **Calculate if the weight exceeds the limit:**
   - Since 720 kg > 700 kg, the total weight exceeds the elevator's maximum load.

6. **Determine how much more than the maximum load they exceed:**
   - Excess over max load = Total weight - Max load = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

Therefore, Jack and his friends would have exceeded the elevator's maximum load by 20 kg. 

{The final answer is} 20 kg.<|im_end|>",20

4. **Subtract the total number of candies eaten by Ginger from the total number of candies eaten by Amy**.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Determine how many days are in two weeks
- There are 7 days in one week.
- Therefore, there are \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) days in two weeks.

### Step 2: Calculate how many candies Ginger eats over two weeks
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces of candy.
- She eats 4 pieces per day.
- Over 14 days, she will eat \( 14 \times 4 = 56 \) pieces of candy.

### Step 3: Calculate how many candies Amy eats over two weeks
- Amy also starts with 100 pieces of candy.
- She eats 3 pieces per day.
- Over 14 days, she will eat \( 14 \times 3 = 42 \) pieces of candy.

### Step 4: Subtract the total number of candies eaten by Ginger from the total number of candies eaten by Amy
- Amy eats a total of 42 pieces of candy.
- Ginger eats a total of 56 pieces of candy.
- The difference is \( 42 - 56 = -14 \).

Since the result is negative, it means that Ginger has more candy than Amy after two weeks.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify given information:**
   - Clara has twice as many books as Steven.
   - Clara has 20 books.

2. **Determine how many books Steven has:**
   - Since Clara has twice as many books as Steven, we can set up an equation to find out how many books Steven has.
   \[
   \text{Number of books Steven has} = \frac{\text{Number of books Clara has}}{2}
   \]
   Substituting the number of books Clara has (20):
   \[
   \text{Number of books Steven has} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate how many more books Alice has than Steven:**
   - We know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven.

<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of topaz gemstones in each necklace:**
   - Each necklace contains 8 topaz gemstones.

2. **Determine the length of the entire necklace:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.

3. **Calculate the length occupied by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, the total length of the topaz gemstones will be \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.

4. **Subtract the length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace:**
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) inches.

5. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads used:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of an inch.
   - Number of beads needed = \( \frac{17}{\frac{1}{4}} \).

6. **Simplify the division:**
   - Dividing 17 by \( \frac{1}{4} \) is equivalent to multiplying 17 by 4 (since dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal).
   - Therefore, \( 17 \times 4 = 68 \).

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

Since each eraser costs $2, then 0.6 erasers would cost \(0.6 \times \$2 = \$1.2\).

Step 3: Calculate the cost for 0.8 pencils.
Since each pencil costs $3, then 0.8 pencils would cost \(0.8 \times \$3 = \$2.4\).

Step 4: Add the costs together to get the total amount.
\[ \$1.2 (cost of erasers) + \$2.4 (cost of pencils) = \$3.6 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 0.6 erasers and 0.8 pencils is $3.6. 

The final answer is: The final answer is $3.6.<|im_end|>",36

                    question:
                    Tim grows 5 trees.  . Each year he ; collects : 6 lemons from each tree.  How : many lemons does ! he get . in , a decade?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of years**: We know that Tim grows trees for one year at a time (a ""decade"" typically refers to 10 years).

2. **Calculate the total number of years**: Since Tim grows trees for one year per decade, we have 10 years.

3. **Find out how many times he gets lemons each year**: Each year, Tim collects lemons from his trees. According to the information given, he collects 6 lemons from each tree every year.

4. **Multiply the number of lemons collected per tree per year by the number of trees**: Tim has 5 trees, so we multiply the annual collection amount by the number of trees.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Lemons} = 6 \text{ lemons/tree/year} \times 5 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Perform the multiplication**:
  
   \[
   \text{Total Lemons} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ lemons}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of years**: As mentioned earlier, Tim grows trees for 10 years.

7. **Finally, find the total number of lemons collected over 10 years**: Multiply the total number of lemons collected per year by the number of years.

   \[
   \text{Total Lemons} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years}
   \]

8. **Perform the multiplication again**:

   \[
   \text{Total Lemons} = 30 \times 10 = 300 \text{ lemons}

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Determine the total number of carrots picked.
2. Calculate the number of good carrots.
3. Subtract the number of good carrots from the total to find the number of bad carrots.

Step 1: Total number of carrots picked
Haley picked 39 carrots, and her mom picked an unknown amount, which we'll call ""x"".
Total = Haley's carrots + Mom's carrots
Total = 39 + x

Step 2: Number of good carrots
We know that 64 out of all the carrots were good.
Since we don't know the value of x yet, we can express the number of good carrots as:
Number of good carrots = 64 (this is true for any x)

Step 3: Number of bad carrots
To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots:
Bad carrots = Total - Number of good carrots
Bad carrots = (39 + x) - 64

Now, we need to determine the value of x. Since the total number of carrots must be a whole number, we can set up the equation:
(39 + x) - 64 = Bad carrots

Simplify:
-25 + x = Bad carrots

This equation tells us that the difference between the total number of carrots and 64 must equal the number of bad carrots. However, without additional information about the total number of carrots or the value of x, we cannot determine the exact number of bad carrots.

Final Answer:
The final answer is: The number of bad carrots depends on the value of x, which represents the number of carrots picked by Haley's mom. To find the specific number of bad carrots, we would need more information about the total number of carrots or the value of x.<|im_end|>",13

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many math and science problems Paige has left after finishing her homework.

Step 1: Determine total number of problems.
Paige has 43 math problems and 12 science problems. Therefore, the total number of problems is:

\[ \text{Total problems} = 43 + 12 = 55 \]

Step 2: Determine how many problems Paige finished.
Paige finished 44 problems.

Step 3: Calculate remaining problems in each subject.
- Math problems remaining: \( 43 - 44 = -1 \) (Since it's not possible to have negative problems, let's assume there was an error in the given information or that she didn't finish all the math problems)

Let's correct our approach. Since the problem states that she finished 44 problems, we'll focus on those.

Step 4: Calculate remaining problems in each subject based on what she actually finished.
- Math problems completed: \( 43 - 44 = -1 \)
- Science problems completed: \( 12 - 0 = 12 \) (assuming no problems were missed in science since she finished all other problems)

Step 5: Sum up the remaining problems from both subjects.
- Remaining math problems: \( 43 - 44 = -1 \)
- Remaining science problems: \( 12 - 0 = 12 \)

Given that she couldn't complete all her problems as stated, let's re-evaluate if the problem statement might be incorrect or misinterpreted. Assuming the intention was to clarify her progress rather than calculate all problems, we should conclude with the understanding that she only completed 44 out of 55 problems.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of apples ordered:**
   - Red apples: 33
   - Green apples: 23
   - Total apples = Red apples + Green apples
     \[
     33 + 23 = 56
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of students who wanted fruit:**
   - Only 21 students wanted fruit.

3. **Subtract the number of students from the total number of apples to find out how many apples were left over:**
   - Apples remaining = Total apples - Number of students who wanted fruit
     \[
     56 - 21 = 35
     \]

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 35 extra apples after distributing them to the students.<|im_end|>",35

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of cats initially.
- The pet store has 41 Siamese cats.
- The pet store also has 28 house cats.

Total number of cats = Siamese cats + House cats
= 41 + 28
= 69 cats

Step 2: Subtract the number of cats sold during the sale from the initial total.
- They sold 15 cats during the sale.

Number of cats remaining = Initial total - Sold cats
= 69 - 15
= 54 cats

Therefore, after the sale, the pet store has 54 cats left.

{The final answer is} 54 cats.<|im_end|>",54

   - Calculation: $35 + $50 = $85.

3. **Spending on a game**: He spends $84 on a new game.
   - Calculation: $85 - $84 = $1.

So, after all these transactions, Oliver has $1 left.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of files Vanessa initially has**
- Vanessa has 13 music files.
- She also has 30 video files.

Total number of files = Music files + Video files
= 13 (music) + 30 (video)
= 43 files

**Step 2: Calculate the number of files deleted**
- Vanessa deletes 10 files from her flash drive.

**Step 3: Subtract the number of deleted files from the initial total**
- Initial total number of files = 43
- Number of files deleted = 10

Number of files remaining = Total initial number - Files deleted
= 43 - 10
= 33 files

Therefore, after deleting 10 files, Vanessa still has **33 files** left on her flash drive.<|im_end|>",33

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of apples ordered**:
   - Red apples: 8
   - Green apples: 43
   - Total apples = Red apples + Green apples
     \[
     \text{Total apples} = 8 + 43 = 51
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of apples needed per student**:
   - Number of students wanting fruit: 42
   - Apples needed per student = Total apples / Number of students
     \[
     \text{Apples needed per student} = \frac{51}{42}
     \]
     Simplify the fraction:
     \[
     \text{Apples needed per student} = \frac{17}{14} \approx 1.2143
     \]

3. **Determine how many extra apples were used**:
   - Since we can't use fractional apples in practical terms, we'll consider whole apples.
   - Each student gets approximately 1 apple (since \( \frac{17}{14} \) is less than 2 but more than 1).
   - Therefore, 42 students will get 42 apples.

4. **Subtract the apples already distributed from the total**:
   - Apples left over = Total apples - Apples distributed to students
     \[
     \text{Apples left over} = 51 - 42 = 9
     \]

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 9 extra apples.<|im_end|>",9

### Step 1: Calculate Total Earnings

- Spring earnings: $2
- Summer earnings: $27
- Cost of supplies: $5

Total earnings = Spring earnings + Summer earnings - Cost of supplies

Substitute the values into the equation:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$2 + \$27 - \$5 \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$34 - \$5 \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$29 \]

So, Edward ended up with **$29** after spending on supplies.<|im_end|>",24

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

2. Calculate the number of apples used.
3. Find out how many extra apples were left.

Step 1: Total number of apples ordered
The cafeteria ordered 37 red apples + 45 green apples = 82 apples in total.

Step 2: Number of apples used
Only 51 students wanted fruit, so all 51 students received their fruit.

Step 3: Extra apples calculated
Since 51 apples were given to the students who wanted fruit, we need to find out how many more apples there were than needed.

Total apples ordered - Apples given away = Extra apples
82 (total apples) - 51 (apples given away) = 31 extra apples.

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 31 extra apples. 

The final answer is: The final answer is 31.<|im_end|>",31

   Total earnings = Spring earnings + Summer earnings
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 4 + 50 = 54 \text{ dollars}

To determine how many extra apples were left over after the students took their share, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of apples ordered:**
   - The cafeteria ordered 6 red apples.
   - They also ordered 15 green apples.

2. **Sum the total number of apples:**
   \[
   \text{Total apples} = \text{Red apples} + \text{Green apples}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total apples} = 6 + 15
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total apples} = 21
   \]

3. **Determine how many students wanted fruit:**
   - According to the problem, only 5 students wanted fruit.

4. **Calculate the number of apples taken by the students:**
   \[
   \text{Apples taken} = \text{Number of students} \times \text{Apples per student}
   \]
   Since we don't know the number of apples each student takes, let's denote it as \( x \).

5. **Substitute the known values into the equation:**
   \[
   \text{Apples taken} = 5x
   \]

6. **Subtract the number of apples taken from the total number of apples:**
   \[
   \text{Extra apples} = \text{Total apples} - \text{Apples taken}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Extra apples} = 21 - 5x
   \]

Since the exact value of \( x \) (the number of apples each student takes) is not provided in the problem, we can express the extra apples in terms of \( x \). However, since the problem asks for an ""extra"" quantity, and without knowing the specific distribution among the students, we assume that the remaining apples are simply the leftover after the maximum possible number of apples taken by one student, which would be 21.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total amount of candy:**
   - Katie has 10 pieces.
   - Her sister has 6 pieces.

2. **Calculate the initial total amount of candy:**
   \[
   10 + 6 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Determine how much candy was eaten on the first night:**
   - They ate 9 pieces.

4. **Subtract the number of candies eaten from the initial total:**
   \[
   16 - 9 = 7 \text{ pieces remaining}
   \]

5. **Add the remaining candies to both quantities (Katie's and her sister's):**
   - Katie now has \( 10 + 7 = 17 \) pieces.
   - Her sister still has \( 6 + 7 = 13 \) pieces.

Therefore, after eating 9 pieces on the first night, Katie and her sister together have 7 pieces left in total.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

   - She also has 42 video files.

   Total number of files = Music files + Video files
   \[
   \text{Total} = 27 + 42 = 69

2. **Subtract the number of files deleted from the initial total:**
   - Haley deletes 11 files.

   Number of files remaining after deletion = Initial total - Deleted files
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 69 - 11 = 58
   \]

3. **Identify what remains on the flash drive:**
   - The remaining files will be either music or video files since they are stored on a flash drive.

Since the problem doesn't specify whether the deleted files were music or video, we can only determine that there are still some files left on the flash drive. However, without more information about the type of files deleted, we cannot determine exactly how many of each remain.

Therefore, based solely on the given information, the number of files remaining on the flash drive is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of cupcakes and cookies baked:**
   - Wendy baked 41 cupcakes.
   - Wendy also baked 31 cookies.

2. **Calculate the total number of items (cupcakes + cookies) that were sold or taken back:**
   - Total items = cupcakes + cookies = 41 + 31 = 72 items.

3. **Subtract the number of items left after the sale from the total number of items:**
   - Items left after the sale = 32 items.
   - Number of items sold = Total items - Items left = 72 - 32 = 40 items.

4. **Determine how many cupcakes were sold:**
   - Since we know the total number of cupcakes is 41, all 41 cupcakes must have been sold because no cupcakes were left over.

5. **Determine how many cookies were sold:**
   - The remaining 32 items are either cupcakes or cookies. We already accounted for 41 cupcakes being sold. Therefore, the rest must be cookies.
   - Cookies sold = Total cookies - Remaining cupcakes = 31 - 19 = 12 cookies.

6. **Summarize the results:**
   - Pastries sold = 41 cupcakes
   - Cookies sold = 12 cookies

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} Pastries sold = 41, Cookies sold = 12.<|im_end|>",40

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of apples ordered.
- Red apples: 25
- Green apples: 17
Total apples ordered = 25 (red) + 17 (green) = 42 apples

Step 2: Determine how many students want fruit.
- Number of students who want fruit: 10

Step 3: Calculate how many apples were used by the students.
- Since each student gets one apple, the number of apples used is equal to the number of students who want fruit.
- Apples used = 10 students × 1 apple/student = 10 apples

Step 4: Subtract the number of apples used from the total number of apples ordered.
- Extra apples left over = Total apples ordered - Apples used
- Extra apples left over = 42 apples - 10 apples = 32 apples

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 32 extra apples.

Final Answer: The final answer is: The cafeteria ended up with 32 extra apples.<|im_end|>",32

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cupcakes Carol still has after selling some of her cupcakes.

1. **Initial number of cupcakes:**
   Carol initially had 30 cupcakes.

2. **Cupcakes sold:**
   Carol sold 9 cupcakes.

3. **Remaining cupcakes after sales:**
   To find out how many cupcakes Carol has left after selling 9 of them, we subtract the number of cupcakes sold from the initial total:

   \[
   30 - 9 = 21
   \]

So, Carol has 21 cupcakes remaining.

4. **Additional cupcakes made:**
   After selling the cupcakes, Carol made 28 more cupcakes.

5. **Total cupcakes now:**
   To find out the total number of cupcakes Carol has at this point, we add the additional cupcakes to the remaining cupcakes:

   \[
   21 + 28 = 49
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is that Carol has 49 cupcakes in total.<|im_end|>",49

- The teacher originally had 6 worksheets to grade.

Step 2: Calculate the number of additional worksheets that need grading after more papers were turned in.
- She graded 4 worksheets initially.
- Then, 18 more worksheets were turned in.

Step 3: Add the initial amount to the additional amount to find the total number of worksheets needing grading.
- Initial worksheets + Additional worksheets = Total worksheets needed for grading.

Let's do the math:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine initial total**: Cody initially has 49 tickets.
2. **Subtract spent tickets**: He spends 25 tickets on a beanie.
3. **Add back won tickets**: After spending, he wins an additional 6 tickets.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Initial Total Tickets
Cody starts with 49 tickets.

\[ \text{Initial total} = 49 \]

### Step 2: Subtract Spent Tickets
He spends 25 tickets on a beanie.

\[ \text{Remaining after buying beanie} = 49 - 25 \]

### Step 3: Add Back Won Tickets
After winning some tickets, he adds them back.

\[ \text{Final count} = 24 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Final count} = 30 \]

So, Cody would end up with **30** tickets in total.<|im_end|>",30

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of books Edward has after selling some.**

Edward initially has 43 books.

He sells 19 books.
\[ 43 - 19 = 24 \]

So, after selling 19 books, Edward has 24 books left.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Edward earns from selling his books.**

We don't know the price per book, so let's assume it costs $1 for simplicity (since no other information was provided).

If each book costs $1, then selling 19 books will earn him:
\[ 19 \times \$1 = \$19 \]

**Step 3: Use the money earned to buy new books.**

Edward uses the $19 earned to buy 14 new books.

**Step 4: Determine the total number of books Edward ends up with.**

After buying 14 new books, he adds these to the remaining books he had after selling some.
\[ 24 + 14 = 38 \]

Therefore, after all transactions, Edward would have **38 books** in total.<|im_end|>",38

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of carrots picked.
2. Calculate the number of good carrots based on the given percentage.
3. Subtract the number of good carrots from the total to find out how many bad carrots there are.

Let's go through it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Total Number of Carrots Picked
Carol picked 29 carrots, and her mom picked 16 carrots. So, the total number of carrots picked is:
\[ \text{Total} = 29 + 16 = 45 \]

### Step 2: Number of Good Carrots
We know that only 38% of the carrots are good. To find out how many good carrots there are, we calculate:
\[ \text{Good Carrots} = 0.38 \times 45 \]
\[ \text{Good Carrots} = 17.1 \]

Since the number of carrots must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number because you can't have a fraction of a carrot in this context (assuming ""bad"" means not counted). Therefore, the number of good carrots is:
\[ \text{Good Carrots} = 17 \]

### Step 3: Number of Bad Carrots
Now, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots to find out how many bad carrots there are:
\[ \text{Bad Carrots} = \text{Total} - \text{Good Carrots} \]
\[ \text{Bad Carrots} = 45 - 17 = 28 \]

So, the number of bad carrots they had is **28**.<|im_end|>",7

### Step 1: Determine the total number of carrots picked.
Bianca picked 26 carrots.
Her mother picked 15 carrots.

Total number of carrots = Bianca's carrots + Mother's carrots
\[ \text{Total number of carrots} = 26 + 15 \]
\[ \text{Total number of carrots} = 41 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of good carrots.
Only 16 of these carrots were good.

### Step 3: Subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots to find the number of bad carrots.
Number of bad carrots = Total number of carrots - Number of good carrots
\[ \text{Number of bad carrots} = 41 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Number of bad carrots} = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of bad carrots they had is **25**.<|im_end|>",25

To determine how many cupcakes Katie sold, let's follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of cupcakes baked:**
   - Katie baked 7 cupcakes.

2. **Determine the total number of items available after the sale:**
   - Katie had 8 items in total (cupcakes + cookies).

3. **Calculate the total number of items sold:**
   - Since there were 8 items at the end, and 7 cupcakes were initially baked, we need to find out how many cupcakes were not sold.
   
4. **Subtract the number of cupcakes from the initial count:**
   \[
   \text{Number of cupcakes sold} = \text{Total cupcakes baked} - \text{Remaining cupcakes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of cupcakes sold} = 7 - (\text{Total items sold} - 8)
   \]

5. **Solve for the remaining items sold:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of items that were taken back home.
   - The equation becomes:
     \[
     \text{Number of cupcakes sold} = 7 - (x - 8)
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     \text{Number of cupcakes sold} = 7 - x + 8
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of cupcakes sold} = 15 - x
     \]

6. **Since all items must have been sold or returned:**
   - We know that the total number of items sold plus the number of items taken back equals the initial amount of 8 items.
   - Therefore, the number of cupcakes sold should equal the remaining items minus the number taken back:
   \[
   \text{Number of cupcakes sold} = \frac{\text{Total items}}{\text{Number per item}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of cupcakes sold} = \frac{15}{\text{Number per item}}
   \]

Given that the total number of items is 8, and considering the initial setup, it appears that Katie did indeed sell some cupcakes before taking any back home. To find the exact number of cupcakes sold, we can solve for \( x \):

- If \( x \) represents the number of items taken back home, then the total items sold would be:
  \[
  \text{Total items sold} = 8 - x
  \]
  
- And since the total items sold includes both cupcakes and cookies:
  \[
  \text{Total items sold} = \text{Cupcakes sold} + \text{Cookies sold}
  \]
  
- Given that the total number of items sold is 8, and knowing that the number of cupcakes sold is greater than the number of cookies sold, we can conclude:
  \[
  \text{Cupcakes sold} > \text{Cookies sold}
  \]
  
Therefore, Katie sold more cupcakes than cookies.

**Final Answer:**
Katie sold **7 cupcakes**.<|im_end|>",4

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of carrots picked:**
   - Vanessa picked 17 carrots.
   - Her mother picked 14 carrots.

   Let \( T \) represent the total number of carrots picked.

   \[
   T = 17 + 14
   \]

   Calculate \( T \):

   \[
   T = 31
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of good carrots:**
   According to the problem, only 24 out of the 31 carrots are considered ""good.""

3. **Determine the number of bad carrots:**
   To find the number of bad carrots, subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked.

   \[
   \text{Number of bad carrots} = T - \text{Number of good carrots}
   \]

   Substitute the values we know:

   \[
   \text{Number of bad carrots} = 31 - 24
   \]

   Calculate the result:

   \[
   \text{Number of bad carrots} = 7
   \]

Therefore, the number of bad carrots that Vanessa and her mother had is **7**.<|im_end|>",7
