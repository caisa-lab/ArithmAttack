tracy used a hook of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. how many pieces did she obtain?,"<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    tracy used a hook of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. how many pieces did she obtain?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Convert the length of the original wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, we can multiply the length of the wire (4 feet) by 12 to get:

4 feet × 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Step 2: Since Tracy wants to cut the wire into pieces 6 inches long, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from the original 48-inch wire.

To do this, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 inches ÷ 6 inches = 8

Step 3: Since we're dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece, the result will be the number of pieces Tracy can obtain. Therefore, the answer is:

{The final answer is 8}.<|eot_id|>",8.0,8.0,8.0

                    question:
                    dan plants 3 rose bushes. each rose bush has 25 flowers. each rose has 8 thorns. how many thorns are there total?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Dan plants 3 rose bushes. This means we have a total of 3 rose bushes.

Step 2: Each rose bush has 25 flowers. This means we have a total of 25 flowers on each of the 3 rose bushes.

To calculate the total number of flowers, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of flowers on each bush:

3 rose bushes × 25 flowers/bush = 75 flowers

Step 3: Each rose has 8 thorns. This means we have 8 thorns on each of the 75 flowers.

To calculate the total number of thorns, we multiply the number of flowers by the number of thorns on each flower:

75 flowers × 8 thorns/flower =?

Step 4: Multiply the numbers together:

75 flowers × 8 thorns/flower = 600 thorns

Step 5: The final answer is:

{The final answer is 600 thorns}<|eot_id|>",600.0,600.0,600.0

                    question:
                    harry slept 9 hours last night. his friend james slept only 2/3 of what harry had ; how many more hours did harry sleep than james?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
Harry slept 9 hours last night.
James slept only 2/3 of what Harry had.

Step 2: Convert the fraction to a decimal to make it easier to calculate.
2/3 = 0.67 (approximately)

Step 3: Calculate the number of hours James slept.
James slept 0.67 x 9 hours (since he slept 2/3 of what Harry had).
James slept approximately 6 hours.

Step 4: Calculate the difference between the number of hours Harry slept and James slept.
Harry slept 9 hours, and James slept approximately 6 hours.
The difference is 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

Step 5: Determine how many more hours Harry slept than James.
Harry slept 3 hours more than James.

                    question:
                    a classroom involves a whiteboard which is shared between the 4 teachers who take turns using the classroom. each teacher has 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard in each lesson. if the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, how many times is the whiteboard cleaned in a day?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of teachers using the whiteboard.

There are 4 teachers who take turns using the whiteboard.

Step 2: Determine the number of lessons each teacher has per day.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.

Step 3: Determine the number of times each teacher uses the whiteboard per day.

Each teacher uses the whiteboard in each of their 2 lessons per day. Therefore, each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times per day.

Step 4: Determine the total number of times the whiteboard is used per day.

Since there are 4 teachers, and each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times per day, the total number of times the whiteboard is used per day is:

4 teachers x 2 uses per day per teacher = 8 uses per day

Step 5: Determine the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

Step 6: Determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day.

Since each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times per day, and the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day is:

8 uses per day (from Step 4) x 3 cleanings per lesson = 24 cleanings per day

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. To find the total number of flowers he has planted, we need to multiply the number of days by the number of flowers he plants each day.

15 days × 2 flowers/day = 30 flowers

Step 2: However, 5 flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to subtract the 5 flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers he planted.

30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: We know that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. This means that Amy's number of friends is 20 more than Lily's number of friends.

Step 2: We know that Lily made 50 friends. So, Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, which means Amy made:

50 (Lily's friends) + 20 = 70

So, Amy made 70 friends.

Step 3: We want to find the total number of friends that Lily and Amy have together. To do this, we add the number of friends Lily made (50) to the number of friends Amy made (70).

50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120

Step 4: Therefore, the total number of friends that Lily and Amy have together is 120.

                    a tanks of water has a depth of 17 feet on monday. on tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water. on wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on tuesday. what is the tank’s water depth on wednesday?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.
The tank had 7 feet more water on Tuesday than on Monday, so we need to add 7 feet to the original depth of 17 feet.

17 feet (Monday) + 7 feet = 24 feet (Tuesday)

Step 2: Determine the depth of the water on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two-thirds of 24 feet, we can multiply 24 feet by 2/3.

24 feet × (2/3) = 16 feet

Step 3: Write the final answer.
The tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

{The final answer is 16 feet}.<|eot_id|>",16.0,16.0,16.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's start by identifying what we know. Ethel has $8.

Step 2: The problem states that Jimmy loses $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. We can write this as an equation:

Jimmy's money = 2 x Ethel's money + 2

Step 3: Since Ethel has $8, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Jimmy's money = 2 x 8 + 2

Step 4: Multiply 2 by 8:

Jimmy's money = 16 + 2

Step 5: Add 2 to 16:

Jimmy's money = 18

Step 6: Since Jimmy loses $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, we need to subtract 2 from Jimmy's money:

Jimmy's money = 18 - 2

Step 7: Subtract 2 from 18:

Jimmy's money = 16

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
Andy finds 90 geraniums.

Step 2: Identify the additional information
He finds 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. This means we need to subtract 40 from the number of geraniums to get the number of petunias.

Step 3: Calculate the number of petunias
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
= 90 - 40
= 50

Step 4: Add the number of geraniums and petunias to get the total number of flowers
Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
= 90 + 50

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the amount spent on advertising for the first year:
The corporation spends $15,000 on advertising for the first year.

Step 2: Determine the amount spent on advertising for the second year:
The corporation spends a third of the amount spent in the first year, which is:

$15,000 / 3 = $5,000

So, the corporation spends $5,000 on advertising for the second year.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent on advertising for both years:
To find the total amount spent on advertising for both years, we add the amounts spent in each year:

$15,000 (first year) + $5,000 (second year) = $20,000

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of slices needed for all the fingers.

Since there are 20 fingers, and each finger needs 4 slices, the total number of slices needed is:

20 fingers x 4 slices/finger = 80 slices

Step 2: Since pizzas are sold in 8-slice portions, we need to find the number of pizzas needed to cover the total number of slices needed.

To do this, we'll divide the total number of slices needed (80) by the number of slices per pizza (8):

80 slices ÷ 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas

Step 3: Since we can't order a fraction of a pizza, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure we have enough slices.

In this case, we need 10 pizzas to cover the total number of slices needed, so we'll order:

{The final answer is} 10 pizzas.<|eot_id|>",10.0,10.0,10.0

* Cocoa: $4.20
* Laundry: $9.45
* Pasta: $1.35
* Total cost: $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

Step 2: The grandma pays $20.00. To find the change, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount she pays:

$20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

{The final answer is $5.00}

The cashier will give the grandma $5.00 in change.<|eot_id|>",5.0,5.0,5.0

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Ann is 9 years old, and her brother is twice her age.

Step 2: Determine the age of Ann's brother.
Since Ann is 9 years old, and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate the age of her brother as follows:

Brother's age = 2 x Ann's age
= 2 x 9
= 18

So, Ann's brother is currently 18 years old.

Step 3: Determine how old Ann's brother will be in 3 years.
To find the answer, we need to add 3 years to his current age:

Brother's age in 3 years = Current age + 3
= 18 + 3
= 21

So, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Annika brought $50 to the town fair.

Step 2: She spent half of it on food and snacks. To find half of $50, I'll divide $50 by 2:

$50 ÷ 2 = $25

So, Annika spent $25 on food and snacks.

Step 3: She also spent an additional $10 for rides.

Step 4: To find the total amount Annika spent, I'll add the $25 she spent on food and snacks to the $10 she spent on rides:

$25 + $10 = $35

Step 5: Since Annika brought $50 to the fair, to find out how much she has left, I'll subtract the total amount she spent ($35) from the original amount she brought ($50):

$50 - $35 = $15

Step 6: The problem asks how much is ""lost"". Since Annika spent a total of $35, that's the amount she ""lost"" or spent. So, the answer is:

Step 2: She spent the rest of her money on an $11 sweater. To find out how much money she spent on the sweater, we need to subtract the cost of the sweater from her initial amount:

$36 - $11 = $25

So, Andrea spent $25 on the sweater.

Step 3: She then gave her brother $4.

Step 4: To find out how much money Andrea has left after giving her brother $4, we need to subtract the amount she gave her brother from the amount she spent on the sweater:

$25 - $4 = $21

So, Andrea has $21 left.

Step 5: Since Andrea started with $36, to find out how much she saved, we need to subtract her final amount from her initial amount:

$36 - $21 = $15

{The final answer is $15.}<|eot_id|>",21.0,21.0,15.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Ray has 25 lollipops initially.

Step 2: Ray remains 5 lollipops for himself, which means he gives away the remaining lollipops.

Step 3: To find the number of lollipops Ray gives away, we subtract the number of lollipops he keeps (5) from the initial total (25):

25 - 5 = 20

So, Ray gives away 20 lollipops.

Step 4: Ray shares the remaining lollipops equally among his four friends. To find the number of lollipops each friend receives, we divide the number of lollipops Ray gives away (20) by the number of friends (4):

20 ÷ 4 = 5

Step 5: Each of Ray's four friends receives 5 lollipops.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the variables

* Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked.
* They picked 60 oranges in total.
* Stetson gives up $10 for each orange he eats.

Step 2: Calculate the number of oranges Stetson ate

* 2/5 of the oranges they picked is the same as saying 2 out of 5 parts of the total oranges.
* Since they picked 60 oranges, 2 out of 5 parts would be (2/5) × 60 = 24 oranges.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Stetson gave up

* Stetson gives up $10 for each orange he eats.
* He ate 24 oranges, so he gave up 24 × $10 = $240.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Brett is currently 14 years old.
* In four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now.

Step 2: Determine what we know about Brett's age in four years.

* In four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

Step 3: Determine what we know about Angela's age in four years.

* According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14, Angela will be 3 × 14 = 42 years old in four years.

Step 4: Determine Angela's current age.

* Since Angela will be 42 years old in four years, we need to subtract 4 from her future age to find her current age. 42 - 4 = 38.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** The problem states that the boy has 5 cards.

**Step 2:** The problem also states that his sister has 3 fewer cards than the boy has. To find out how many cards his sister has, we need to subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has.

5 (boy's cards) - 3 = 2

**Step 3:** So, the sister has 2 cards.

**Step 4:** To find the total number of cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the sister has.

5 (boy's cards) + 2 (sister's cards) = 7

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Identify the given information

* The helicopter travels 1200 miles in 3 hours.
* We need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

**Step 2:** Calculate the helicopter's speed

* To find the helicopter's speed, we can divide the distance traveled (1200 miles) by the time taken (3 hours).
* Speed = Distance / Time = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour

**Step 3:** Determine the additional distance to be traveled

* The helicopter needs to travel an additional 2000 miles.

**Step 4:** Calculate the additional time required to travel the additional distance

* To find the additional time required, we can divide the additional distance (2000 miles) by the helicopter's speed (400 miles per hour).
* Additional time = Additional distance / Speed = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours

**Step 5:** Combine the initial time with the additional time

* The helicopter has already traveled 1200 miles in 3 hours. To travel an additional 2000 miles, it will take an additional 5 hours.
* Total time = Initial time + Additional time = 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how much meat Prince gets in a day.
Prince gets 15kg of meat every hour he works. Since he works 10 hours a day, he gets:

15kg/hour x 10 hours = 150kg of meat per day

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of meat Prince has to sell.
Bill's bull weighs 750kg, which is the amount of meat Prince needs to sell.

Step 3: Divide the total amount of meat by the amount of meat Prince gets in a day.
To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat, we need to divide the total amount of meat by the amount of meat he gets in a day:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* When a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright.
* 60% of these riders are women.

Step 2: Calculate the number of riders who can stay upright

* 25% of 100 riders can stay upright. To find this number, multiply 25% by 100:
25% = 0.25
0.25 × 100 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Step 3: Calculate the number of women who can stay upright

* 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women. Since we know 25 riders can stay upright, we can calculate the number of women as:
60% of 25 = 0.6 × 25 = 15

So, 15 women can stay upright.

Step 4: Calculate the number of men who can stay upright

* Since 15 women can stay upright, the remaining riders who can stay upright are men. To find the number of men, subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
25 (total riders who can stay upright) - 15 (women) = 10

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the given information
Shiela has already written 1/3 of the paper, which means she has completed 1/3 of the total pages.

Step 2: Identify the total number of pages
The problem states that Shiela needs to offer a 15-page professional draft. This is the total number of pages she needs to complete.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pages Shiela has already written
Since Shiela has already written 1/3 of the paper, we need to find 1/3 of the total number of pages. To do this, we can multiply the total number of pages by 1/3.

15 pages (total) x 1/3 = 5 pages

So, Shiela has already written 5 pages.

Step 4: Calculate the number of pages Shiela has left to write
To find the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the goal
The local girls want to raise $6300.

Step 2: Identify the amount raised so far
After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.

Step 3: Calculate the amount still needed to reach the goal
To find out how much more they need to raise, subtract the amount raised so far from the goal:

$6300 (goal) - $2100 (amount raised so far) = $4200

Step 4: Calculate the amount raised per hour
Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, calculate the amount raised per hour:

$2100 ÷ 3 hours = $700 per hour

Step 5: Calculate the total hours needed to reach the goal
To find out how many more hours they need to fundraise, divide the amount still needed to reach the goal ($4200) by the amount raised per hour ($700):

$4200 ÷ $700 = 6 hours

                    question:
                    while parking down the student with his 3 younger siblings, greg found $20. to be fair to his siblings, he decided to split the money equally. how much money did each of them get?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total amount of money Greg found.
Greg found $20.

Step 2: Determine the number of people (including Greg) who will split the money equally.
There are 4 people who will split the money equally: Greg and his 3 younger siblings.

Step 3: Divide the total amount of money ($20) by the number of people (4) to find the equal share for each person.
To do this, we can divide $20 by 4:

$20 ÷ 4 = $5

Step 4: Determine how much money each person (including Greg) will get.
Since they are splitting the money equally, each person will get the same amount. In this case, each person will get $5.

{The final answer is $5 each.}<|eot_id|>",5.0,5.0,5.0

                    question:
                    a group of 50 students has various hobbies. 10 like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and the rest like to either play video games or play music. how many like to play video games if the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the known information

* 10 students like to bake
* 5 students like to play basketball
* The rest of the students (50 - 10 - 5 = 35) like to either play video games or play music

Step 2: Use the information about the number of students who like to play music to find the number who like to play music

* Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball, we can set up an equation:

Number of students who like to play music = 2 x Number of students who like to play basketball

Let's call the number of students who like to play basketball ""x"". Then, the number of students who like to play music is 2x.

Step 3: Use the information about the total number of students who like to play music or video games to find the number who like to play video games

* The total number of students who like to play music or video games is 35 (since 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball).
* The number of students who like to play music is 2x, and the number of students who like to play video games is unknown. Let's call the number of students who like to play video games ""y"".
* We can set up an equation to represent the total number of students who like to play music or video games:

2x + y = 35

Step 4: Solve the equation to find the number of students who like to play video games

* To solve for y, we can subtract 2x from both sides of the equation:

y = 35 - 2x

Step 5: Substitute the value of x into the equation to find the number of students who like to play video games

* Since 5 students like to play basketball, x = 5.
* Substitute x = 5 into the equation:

y = 35 - 2(5)
= 35 - 10
= 25

Step 6: {The final answer is} 25 students like to play video games.<|eot_id|>",25.0,25.0,25.0

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    melissa cooks as a pet grooms? this week, she has 8 dogs that need to be bathed, 5 cats that need their nails clipped, 3 birds that need their wings trimmed, and 12 horses that need to be brushed. if she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days, how many animals will she groom each day of the week?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of animals that need to be groomed.
We have:
* 8 dogs that need to be bathed
* 5 cats that need their nails clipped
* 3 birds that need their wings trimmed
* 12 horses that need to be brushed

Adding these up, we get: 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals

Step 2: Determine the total number of grooming jobs.
Each dog needs to be bathed, each cat needs its nails clipped, each bird needs its wings trimmed, and each horse needs to be brushed. So, we have:
* 8 dogs that need to be bathed (8 jobs)
* 5 cats that need their nails clipped (5 jobs)
* 3 birds that need their wings trimmed (3 jobs)
* 12 horses that need to be brushed (12 jobs)

Adding these up, we get: 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 jobs

Step 3: Divide the total number of grooming jobs by the number of days in the week.
There are 7 days in a week. To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we divide the total number of jobs by 7:

28 jobs ÷ 7 days = 4 jobs per day

Step 4: Since each job corresponds to one animal, we multiply the number of jobs per day by the number of animals per job.
* For dogs, 1 bath = 1 dog
* For cats, 1 nail clip = 1 cat
* For birds, 1 wing trim = 1 bird
* For horses, 1 brush = 1 horse

So, we multiply the number of jobs per day by the number of animals per job:
4 jobs per day × (1 dog + 1 cat + 1 bird + 1 horse) = 4 jobs per day × 5 animals per job

Step 5: Simplify the result.
4 jobs per day × 5 animals per job = 20 animals per day

{The final answer is 20 animals per day.}<|eot_id|>",4.0,4.0,20.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Joey plays 2 matches on Monday.

Step 2: Joey plays 1 match on Friday.

Step 3: On Saturday, Joey plays double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, double that would be:

2 x 2 = 4 matches on Saturday.

Step 4: Add up the total number of matches played throughout the week:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how much money Marissa has left after buying the ball for $20.

Initial amount of money: $80
Amount spent on ball: $20
Money left: $80 - $20 = $60

Step 2: Determine how much money Marissa has left after buying candy bars for Jimmy.

Step 3: Calculate how many candy bars Marissa can buy with the remaining $60.

Price of each candy bar: $5
Number of candy bars that can be bought: $60 ÷ $5 = 12

Step 4: Determine how many candy bars Marissa actually buys for Jimmy.

Since Marissa uses the remaining $60 to buy candy bars, she buys 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the original price of the Sony option.
The original price is $1000.

Step 2: Determine the percentage increase (premium) that needs to be added.
The premium is 20%.

Step 3: Convert the percentage increase to a decimal by dividing by 100.
20% = 20 ÷ 100 = 0.20

Step 4: Multiply the original price by the decimal equivalent of the percentage increase.
$1000 × 0.20 = $200

Step 5: Add the result from Step 4 to the original price to find the new price.
$1000 + $200 = $1200

Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day, and each bottle cap is worth $0.25. To find his daily income, we multiply the number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap:

10 bottle caps/day × $0.25/bottle cap = $2.50/day

Step 2: Calculate the total income for a 30-day month
Since Damien makes $2.50 per day, we multiply this daily income by the number of days in the month:

$2.50/day × 30 days = $75.00

Step 1: Identify the number of female lions
The den keeper counts 12 female lions.

Step 2: Identify the number of male lions
The problem states that there are ""half as many male lions"" as female lions. To find the number of male lions, we need to divide the number of female lions by 2:

12 female lions ÷ 2 = 6 male lions

Step 3: Identify the number of lion cubs
The den keeper counts 14 lion cubs.

Step 4: Add the numbers of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs
To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we add the numbers of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs:

12 female lions + 6 male lions + 14 lion cubs =?

* ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long.
* ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.
* The procession wants to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and ""Jingle Bells"" once.

Step 2: Calculate the total time spent singing ""Deck the Halls"".

* Since they want to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, we multiply the length of the song (150 seconds) by 2.
150 seconds x 2 = 300 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent singing ""Jingle Bells"".

* Since they want to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once, we use the given length of the song (240 seconds) as is.

Step 4: Add the total time spent singing ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells"".

Step 2: Calculate the total distance Sofie walks in 7 days

* Sofie walks 10 miles per day.
* To find the total distance Sofie walks in 7 days, multiply the daily distance by the number of days: 10 miles/day × 7 days = 70 miles

Step 3: Since Brian walks half the distance Sofie walks, calculate the distance Brian walks in 7 days

* Sofie walks 70 miles in 7 days (from Step 2).
* Brian walks half the distance Sofie walks, so Brian walks: 70 miles ÷ 2 = 35 miles

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Jack initially has $100.
Jack's initial amount: $100

Step 2: Sophia gives Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find out how much Sophia gives Jack, we need to calculate 1/5 of $100.

1/5 of $100 = $100 ÷ 5 = $20

So, Sophia gives Jack $20.

Step 3: Jack adds the amount Sophia gives him to his initial amount.

Jack's new amount = Jack's initial amount + Sophia's gift

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: We know that each whale has 40 gallons of blood.

Step 2: We also know that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. To find the amount of blood a shark has, we can multiply the amount of blood a whale has by 3:

40 gallons (whale) × 3 = 120 gallons (shark)

Step 3: We want to find the total amount of blood that 10 sharks swimming in the sea have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, we can multiply the number of sharks by the amount of blood each shark has:

10 sharks × 120 gallons/shark = 1200 gallons

Step 4: Therefore, the total number of gallons of blood that 10 sharks swimming in the sea have is 1200 gallons.

* Jolene and her friends have 10 packs of balloons, each containing 30 balloons.
* After the water balloon fight, 12 balloons are left.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of balloons initially
* Since there are 10 packs of balloons, each containing 30 balloons, we can multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack:
10 packs x 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons

Step 3: Subtract the remaining balloons from the initial total
* We are left with 12 balloons after the fight. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the remaining balloons from the initial total:
300 balloons - 12 balloons =?

Step 4: Calculate the number of balloons thrown

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* Ara has been playing 40 games every year for four years.
* Her score for every game is 21 points.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of games played in four years

* Ara plays 40 games per year, so in four years, she will play:
40 games/year × 4 years = 160 games

Step 3: Calculate the total number of points scored in four years

* Ara scores 21 points per game, so the total number of points scored in four years is:
160 games × 21 points/game = 3360 points

Step 4: Verify the calculation

* To ensure the calculation is correct, let's calculate the total number of points scored in each year separately:
Year 1: 40 games × 21 points/game = 840 points
Year 2: 40 games × 21 points/game = 840 points
Year 3: 40 games × 21 points/game = 840 points
Year 4: 40 games × 21 points/game = 840 points

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle, and Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time.

Step 2: Convert Steve's time to a fraction.
Since Steve took 10 hours, we can convert this to a fraction by dividing by 1:
10 hours = 10/1

Step 3: Find half of Steve's time.
To find half of Steve's time, we divide his time by 2:
10/1 ÷ 2 = 5/1

Step 4: Add 2 hours to half of Steve's time.
Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, so we add 2 hours to 5 hours:
5/1 + 2 hours =?

Step 5: Convert the added hours to a fraction.
We can convert the added 2 hours to a fraction by dividing by 1:
2 hours = 2/1

Step 6: Add the fractions.
We add the fraction 5/1 to the fraction 2/1:
(5/1) + (2/1) = (7/1)

Step 7: Simplify the fraction, if necessary.
In this case, the fraction 7/1 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. Therefore, the fraction remains the same:
7/1

Step 8: Convert the final fraction to hours.
To convert the fraction 7/1 back to hours, we divide the numerator by the denominator:
7 ÷ 1 = 7 hours

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the problem statement and the given information.
The proprietor of the docks needs to buy some new line. He wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Right now, there is 200 feet of dock, and he has 6 feet of new line.

Step 2: Determine the total length of line needed.
For every foot of dock, the proprietor needs 3 feet of line. Since there are 200 feet of dock, he needs 200 x 3 = 600 feet of line.

Step 3: Subtract the amount of new line he already has.
He already has 6 feet of new line, so we need to subtract this from the total amount of line needed.

600 (total line needed) - 6 (new line already has) = 594 feet of line needed

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of customers Billy had on Tuesday.
Billy had 8 customers on Tuesday.

Step 2: Identify the number of DVDs sold by the first 3 customers.
The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so the total number of DVDs sold by these customers is:
3 customers x 1 DVD/customer = 3 DVDs

Step 3: Identify the number of DVDs sold by the next 2 customers.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so the total number of DVDs sold by these customers is:
2 customers x 2 DVDs/customer = 4 DVDs

Step 4: Add the number of DVDs sold by the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.
We have sold a total of 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs so far.

Step 5: Since the last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, we don't need to add any more DVDs to our total.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The first time the alarm went off, it rang for 4 times. This means the alarm rang for a total of 4 minutes (since it rings continuously until turned off).

Step 2: The second time the alarm went off, it rang for 3 times as long as the first time. Since the first time it rang for 4 minutes, the second time it will ring for 3 x 4 = 12 minutes.

Step 3: The third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. Since the second time it rang for 12 minutes, the third time it will ring for 12/2 = 6 minutes.

Step 4: To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to add up the number of times it rang each time it went off. For the first time, it rang for 4 minutes. For the second time, it rang for 12 minutes. For the third time, it rang for 6 minutes. Adding these up, we get:

4 minutes + 12 minutes + 6 minutes = 22 minutes

Step 5: Since the alarm rings continuously until turned off, we need to convert the total number of minutes to the total number of rings. Since the alarm rings once every minute, the total number of rings is equal to the total number of minutes:

22 minutes = 22 rings

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: We are given that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey.

Let's denote Corey's age as x. Then, James' age is x - 1 = 10.

Step 2: We can solve for Corey's age:

x = 10 + 1
x = 11

So, Corey is 11 years old.

Step 3: We are also given that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Since Corey is 11 years old, Amy's age is:

11 - 2 = 9

So, Amy is 9 years old.

Step 4: We are given that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Since Amy is 9 years old, Jackson's age is:

9 - 5 = 4

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of vehicles at the port.
The trans officer counted 2 containers of imported cars, each having 5 vehicles inside. Therefore, the initial number of vehicles at the port is:

2 containers x 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

Step 2: Determine the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day.
The problem states that the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means that the number of vehicles increased by 20 (30 - 10 = 20) on the second day.

Step 3: Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.
Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers needed to accommodate the additional 20 vehicles is:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Step 4: Add the number of containers imported on the second day to the initial number of containers.
The initial number of containers was 2. The number of containers imported on the second day is 4. Therefore, the total number of containers at the port is:

2 containers + 4 containers = 6 containers

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of cars available for rent, which is 20.

Step 2: Identify the number of automatic cars, which is 12.

Step 3: Identify the number of manual cars, which is 4.

Step 4: Since the rest of the cars are semi-automatic, we can find the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:

20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4

So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars.

Step 5: To find the fraction of cars that are semi-automatic, we can divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars:

Fraction = Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars
= 4 / 20

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the initial amount of water in the tank.

The tank is initially filled with 120 liters of water.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water used by Celine.

Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank to water her small garden. This means that 90 liters are removed from the tank.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of water left in the tank after Celine's use.

After Celine uses 90 liters, the amount of water left in the tank is:

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Step 4: Calculate the amount of rainwater collected.

Celine collects rainwater that is twice as much as what is left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left in the tank, the amount of rainwater collected is:

2 x 30 liters = 60 liters

Step 5: Add the amount of rainwater collected to the amount of water left in the tank.

The tank now contains the original 30 liters, plus the 60 liters of rainwater collected:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

$18/hour x 5 hours = $90

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of both rentals.

* Carlos' canoe rental costs $90.
* Benji's banana boat raft rental costs $90.
* The total cost is the sum of these two costs:
$90 + $90 = $180

                    question:
                    james has 6 more candies than robert. john has twice as few candies as robert. if john has 54 candies, how many more candies does john have than james?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Since John has 54 candies, we know that John has twice as few candies as Robert. To find out how many candies Robert has, we can divide 54 by 2:

54 ÷ 2 = 27

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Step 2: James has 6 more candies than Robert. We can add 6 to Robert's candies to find out how many candies James has:

27 + 6 = 33

So, James has 33 candies.

Step 3: We want to find out how many more candies John has than James. To do this, we subtract James' candies from John's candies:

54 (John's candies) - 33 (James' candies) = 21

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Chris has 6 trees in his backyard. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. To find out how many trees Ferdinand has, we can divide Chris's number of trees by 2:

6 (Chris's trees) ÷ 2 = 3

So, Ferdinand has 3 trees in his backyard.

Step 2: Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. To find out how many trees Harry has, we can multiply Ferdinand's number of trees by 2 and then add 5:

3 (Ferdinand's trees) × 2 = 6
6 + 5 = 11

So, Harry has 11 trees in his backyard.

Step 3: To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we can subtract Ferdinand's number of trees from Harry's number of trees:

11 (Harry's trees) - 3 (Ferdinand's trees) = 8

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many plant pots April needs for the daisies.
April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies.

Step 2: Determine how many plant pots April needs for the roses.
Since April needs twice as many plant pots for the roses as she does for the daisies, she needs:
30 (daisies) x 2 = 60 plant pots for the roses

Step 3: Calculate the total number of plant pots April needs.
April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and 60 plant pots for the roses, so she needs:
30 (daisies) + 60 (roses) = 90 plant pots in total

Step 4: Subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number April already has.
April already has 100 plant pots. She needs 90 plant pots in total, so she subtracts:
100 (initial plant pots) - 90 (total plant pots needed) = 10

Step 5: Determine how many plant pots April has left over.
April has 10 plant pots left over after buying the needed plant pots for the daisies and roses.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest initially.

Step 2: One of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which means her friend saw:

50 (Katelyn's initial count) ÷ 2 = 25

So, her friend saw 25 fairies flying from the east and joining the initial 50 fairies.

Step 3: The total number of fairies now is:

50 (initial fairies) + 25 (fairies from the east) = 75

Step 4: Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.

Step 5: To find the remaining fairies, subtract the number of fairies that flew away from the total number of fairies:

75 (total fairies) - 30 (fairies that flew away) = 45

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of rows Jackson can plant with the red tulips.

Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row. Since he buys 36 red tulips, he can plant:

36 ÷ 6 = 6 rows of red tulips

Step 2: Calculate the total number of rows Jackson can plant with the blue tulips.

Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row. Since he buys 24 blue tulips, he can plant:

24 ÷ 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips

Step 3: Combine the total number of rows for the red and blue tulips.

Jackson can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. To find the total number of rows, we add the two numbers together:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of bottles Bill already has.

Bill has 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. To find the total number of bottles, we multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles per case:

2 cases × 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Step 2: Calculate the number of bottles needed for the guests.

Bill wants to have 2 bottles of water for each of the 70 guests. To find the total number of bottles needed for the guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest:

70 guests × 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Step 3: Subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles needed.

To find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

140 bottles (needed) - 48 bottles (already have) =?

Step 4: Perform the subtraction.

140 - 48 = 92

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's define the variables:

* Shiloh's current age is 44 years old.
* Shiloh's nephew's current age is x years old.
* In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.
* According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age.

Step 2: Write an equation based on the information:

Let y be Shiloh's age in 7 years. Then, y = 51.

We know that in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age. So, we can set up the equation:

y = 3(x + 7)

Step 3: Substitute the value of y into the equation:

y = 3(x + 7)
51 = 3(x + 7)
Step 4: Simplify the equation:

51 = 3x + 21
30 = 3x

Step 5: Solve for x:

3x = 30
x = 10

Step 6: Since x is the nephew's current age, we add 7 years to find the nephew's age in 7 years:

x + 7 = 10 + 7 = 17

Step 7: Since the problem asks for the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 years from the nephew's age in 7 years to find the nephew's current age:

x = 17 - 7 = 10

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: We know the affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.

Step 2: The dachshund weighs twice as much as the affenpinscher, so we can calculate the dachshund's weight by multiplying the affenpinscher's weight by 2:

Dachshund's weight = Affenpinscher's weight × 2
= 10 pounds × 2
= 20 pounds

Step 3: The papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the dachshund, so we can calculate the papillon's weight by dividing the dachshund's weight by 4:

Papillon's weight = Dachshund's weight ÷ 4
= 20 pounds ÷ 4
= 5 pounds

Step 4: The mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the papillon, so we can calculate the mastiff's weight by multiplying the papillon's weight by 44:

Mastiff's weight = Papillon's weight × 44
= 5 pounds × 44

Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent by the basketball coach.

* The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each.
* To find the total amount spent, multiply the number of basketballs by the cost per basketball: 8 x $14 = $112

Step 3: Find the difference between the amounts spent by the two coaches.

                    question:
                    a perfume firm is trying to create new scents. they already have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. they decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. by the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of vanilla scents sold:
The perfume firm sells 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is:
5 (scents sold per day) x 4 (number of vanilla scents) = 20 vanilla scents sold

Step 2: Identify the number of fruity scents sold:
The perfume firm sells 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is:
2 (scents sold per day) x 8 (number of fruity scents) = 16 fruity scents sold

Step 3: Calculate the difference in the number of scents sold between vanilla and fruity scents:
To find the difference, subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
20 (vanilla scents sold) - 16 (fruity scents sold) = 4

"bennet is a farmer . he sells 20 of his eggplants for $3 each. he has 25 ears of corn that he can sell as well. if bennet wants to make a total of $135, how much should he sell each ear of corn for?","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    bennet is a farmer. he sells 20 of his eggplants for $3 each. he has 25 ears of corn that he can sell as well. if bennet wants to make a total of $135, how much should he sell each ear of corn for?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Bennet has made from selling the eggplants.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money made from eggplants is:

20 eggplants x $3/eggplant = $60

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Bennet still needs to make to reach his target of $135.

Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he has already made $60 from selling eggplants. To find out how much more he needs to make, subtract the amount he has already made from the target:

$135 - $60 = $75

Step 3: Calculate the number of ears of corn Bennet needs to sell to make the remaining amount of money.

Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn, he can sell them at some price to make up the remaining amount of money. Let's call the price he sells each ear of corn for ""x"". The total amount of money he can make from selling the ears of corn is:

25 ears of corn x x = $75

Step 4: Solve for the price ""x"" that Bennet needs to sell each ear of corn for.

To find the price ""x"", divide the amount of money Bennet needs to make ($75) by the number of ears of corn he has (25):

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet needs to sell each ear of corn for $3 to make up the remaining amount of money and reach his target of $135.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the initial temperature of the house.
The problem states that it was 45 degrees during the day. Since the temperature drops 33 degrees at night, we can calculate the initial temperature at night as:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

So, the temperature at night is 12 degrees.

Step 2: Determine the target temperature to prevent pipes from freezing.
The problem states that the temperature inside the house must not fall below 32 degrees to prevent pipes from freezing. Since the temperature at night is 12 degrees, we need to heat the house up to at least 32 degrees.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of heating needed.
To heat the house from 12 degrees to 32 degrees, we need to raise the temperature by:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Step 4: Determine the amount of heat provided by each log of wood.
The problem states that every log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. Since we need to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we can divide the amount of heating needed by the amount of heat provided by each log:

20 degrees ÷ 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Step 5: Determine the final answer.
Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to heat the house up to at least 32 degrees and prevent the pipes from freezing.

{The final answer is 4 logs.}<|eot_id|>",4.0,4.0,4.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the discount amount
Since the jeans are 25% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we can multiply the original price by the discount percentage:

Discount amount = Original price x Discount percentage
= $40 x 25%
= $40 x 0.25
= $10

So, the discount amount is $10.

Step 2: Calculate the new price of the jeans
To find the new price of the jeans, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:

New price = Original price - Discount amount
= $40 - $10
= $30

The new price of the jeans is $30.

Step 3: Calculate the change Mike will receive
Mike pays with a $50 bill, and the new price of the jeans is $30. To find the change he will receive, we subtract the new price from the $50 bill:

Change = $50 - $30
= $20

So, Mike will receive $20 in change.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial distance between the two cars.
Since the second car passes the first car, the distance between them is the distance traveled by the first car before the second car passes it. Since the first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, in 1 hour it will cover a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 1 hour = 60 miles

So, the initial distance between the two cars is 60 miles.

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by each car in 2 hours.
Since both cars continue to travel at the same speed, the distance traveled by each car in 2 hours is:

Distance traveled by first car = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles
Distance traveled by second car = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

Step 3: Calculate the new distance between the two cars.
The new distance between the two cars is the sum of the distances traveled by each car minus the initial distance between them:

New distance = Distance traveled by first car + Distance traveled by second car - Initial distance
= 120 miles + 140 miles - 60 miles
= 200 miles

Step 4: Calculate the final distance between the two cars.
The final distance between the two cars is the new distance calculated in Step 3:

Final distance = 200 miles

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Find the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought.

* Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
* Each package of cat food contains 11 tins.
* To find the total number of tins of cat food, multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package:
8 packages × 11 tins/package = 88 tins

Step 2: Find the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought.

* Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
* Each package of dog food contains 6 tins.
* To find the total number of tins of dog food, multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package:
6 packages × 6 tins/package = 36 tins

Step 3: Find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food.

* Subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:
88 tins (cat food) - 36 tins (dog food) = 52 tins

Step 4: Determine how many more tins of cat food Kimberly bought than dog food.

* The difference between the two is 52 tins. This means Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 x 1 = 12 inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 x 12 = 48 inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 x 48 = 480 inches.

Now, to convert this answer to miles, we need to divide by 5280 (since there are 5280 inches in a mile). So:

                    question:
                    a farmer seeks 5 liters of milk a day from a cow. since he has 3 cows, how many more cows does he need to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the current milk production per day
The farmer currently has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day. To find the total milk production per day, we multiply the number of cows by the milk production per cow:

3 cows × 5 liters/cow = 15 liters/day

Step 2: Determine the desired milk production per day
The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the current and desired milk production
To find out how many more cows the farmer needs, we subtract the current milk production from the desired milk production:

25 liters/day (desired) - 15 liters/day (current) = 10 liters/day

Step 4: Calculate the additional milk production needed per cow
Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, the additional milk production needed per cow is:

10 liters/day (additional) ÷ 5 liters/cow (milk production per cow) = 2 cows

Step 5: Determine the number of additional cows needed
Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, the farmer needs 2 additional cows to produce the additional 10 liters of milk per day.

Step 6: Add the additional cows to the current number of cows
The farmer currently has 3 cows. Adding the 2 additional cows needed, the total number of cows required is:

3 cows (current) + 2 cows (additional) = 5 cows

                    to make a profits of $2000, isaias has to sell the chickens he planned to take to the market from his farm at $50 per chicken. if isaias has 300 chickens on his farm and plans to sell 3/5 of them, for how much money did isaias buy the chicken he took to the market for sale?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many chickens Isaias plans to sell.

Isaias has 300 chickens on his farm and plans to sell 3/5 of them. To find the number of chickens he plans to sell, we can multiply 300 by 3/5:

300 x (3/5) = 300 x 0.6 = 180 chickens

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue Isaias will get from selling the chickens.

Isaias will sell the chickens at $50 per chicken. To find the total revenue, we can multiply the number of chickens he plans to sell by the price per chicken:

180 chickens x $50 per chicken = $9,000

Step 3: Determine how much profit Isaias needs to make.

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find the total revenue needed to make this profit, we can add the profit to the cost of the chickens (which we'll determine in the next step):

$9,000 (total revenue) + $2000 (profit) = $11,000

Step 4: Determine the cost of the chickens.

Since Isaias bought the chickens from his farm, the cost of the chickens is the amount he paid for them. Let's call this cost ""x"". We can set up an equation:

$9,000 (total revenue) = x (cost) + $2000 (profit)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = $9,000 - $2000
x = $7,000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7,000.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Martin's weight is 55 kg, which is given.

Step 2: Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so we can calculate Carl's weight as:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
= 55 kg + 16 kg
= 71 kg

Step 3: Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so we can calculate Christian's weight as:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
= 71 kg + 8 kg
= 79 kg

Step 4: Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so we can calculate Harry's weight as:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Dijana rowed 50 miles the whole day.

Step 2: Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how many miles Anis rowed, we need to calculate 1/5 of 50 miles.

1/5 of 50 miles = 50 ÷ 5 = 10 miles

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana.

Step 3: Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana, which means Anis rowed a total of:

50 (miles rowed by Dijana) + 10 (additional miles rowed by Anis) = 60 miles

Step 4: To find the total distance the two of them rowed on that day, we add the distance rowed by Dijana (50 miles) to the distance rowed by Anis (60 miles).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons.

Step 2: We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of bologna thrown at red balloons is:

2 pieces/balloon × number of red balloons = 2 × 20 = 40 pieces

Step 3: Since Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, the remaining pieces must have been thrown at yellow balloons. Let's call the number of yellow balloons ""x"". Then, the number of pieces thrown at yellow balloons is:

3 pieces/balloon × x = 58 - 40 = 18 pieces

Step 4: Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can set up an equation to solve for x:

3x = 18

Step 5: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:

x = 18 ÷ 3
x = 6

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students.

The teacher has 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. To find the total number of bottles given to the students, multiply the number of students by the number of bottles each student gets:

29 students × 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Step 2: Determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with her coupons.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. To find the total number of bottles the teacher can redeem, multiply the number of coupons by the number of bottles each coupon can redeem:

9 coupons × 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Step 3: Subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can redeem.

The teacher redeems the coupons and gives the students 58 bottles. To find the number of bottles left for the teacher, subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can redeem:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

Step 4: Convert the number of bottles left for the teacher to gallons.

Since each bottle is 0.25 gallons (1 gallon = 4 bottles), multiply the number of bottles left for the teacher by 0.25:

842 bottles × 0.25 = 210.5 gallons

                    pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside.  her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles.  while on vacation, if she will be outside 4 hours a day over 8 days, how many doses of sunscreen will she need to pack?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many hours Pamela will be outside in total.

She will be outside 4 hours a day, and she will be on vacation for 8 days. To find the total number of hours, we multiply the number of hours she will be outside each day by the number of days:

4 hours/day × 8 days = 32 hours

Step 2: Determine how many ounces of sunscreen Pamela will need.

Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside, so she will need:

32 hours × 1 ounce/hour = 32 ounces

Step 3: Convert the total amount of sunscreen needed to doses.

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find the number of doses Pamela will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen needed by the amount in each bottle:

32 ounces ÷ 8 ounces/bottle = 4 doses

Step 4: Consider the fact that Pamela reapplies sunscreen every hour, and she will be outside for 32 hours.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour, she will need a new dose every hour. This means she will need 32 doses of sunscreen, not just 4.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of doses Pamela will need.

To find the total number of doses, we multiply the number of hours she will be outside by the number of doses she will need each hour:

32 hours × 1 dose/hour = 32 doses

Step 6: Determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need.

Since each bottle contains 8 ounces, and Pamela needs 32 doses, we divide the total number of doses by the number of doses in each bottle:

32 doses ÷ 8 doses/bottle = 4 bottles

Step 7: Consider the fact that Pamela reapplies sunscreen every hour, and she will be outside for 32 hours.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour, she will need a new bottle every 8 hours. This means she will need 4 bottles of sunscreen, not just 4 doses.

{The final answer is 4 bottles of sunscreen.}<|eot_id|>",4.0,4.0,4.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Step 2: Adrianne's sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her sister gave her:

20 + 10 = 30

So, Adrianne's sister gave her 30 beads.

Step 3: Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her friend gave her:

2 x 20 = 40

So, Adrianne's friend gave her 40 beads.

Step 4: To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add up the beads she received from her mother, sister, and friend:

20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies brought by the 100 guests.

Each guest brings 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is:

100 guests × 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies given to the church next door.

The bride gives 1/2 of the cookies to the church, which means she gives away half of the total cookies. To find the number of cookies given away, we multiply the total number of cookies by 1/2:

1500 cookies × 1/2 = 750 cookies

Step 3: Calculate the number of people in the church next door who received cookies.

Since each person in the church next door gets 15 cookies, we can divide the number of cookies given away by 15 to find the number of people:

750 cookies ÷ 15 cookies/person = 50 people

Step 4: Calculate the number of Christians in the church next door.

Since we are told that each person in the church next door gets 15 cookies, we can assume that all 50 people in the church next door are Christians. Therefore, the answer is:

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday, so he has a total of 4 bananas.

Step 2: On Thursday, John has 6 bananas, which means he gained 2 bananas (6 - 4 = 2) since Wednesday.

Step 3: On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. Since John picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, triple that amount would be 4 x 3 = 12 bananas.

Step 4: John adds the 12 bananas he picked on Friday to the 6 bananas he already had on Thursday. This gives him a total of 6 + 12 = 18 bananas.

Step 5: John started with 4 bananas on Wednesday, and then added the bananas he picked on Thursday and Friday. Therefore, his final total is 4 + 2 + 12 = 18 bananas.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York.
We are given that the distance is approximately 1955 kilometers.

Step 2: Identify the distance Bernice has already driven.
We are given that Bernice has driven 325 kilometers for 4 days.

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Bernice has driven.
To do this, we multiply the distance driven per day by the number of days:

Distance driven per day = 325 kilometers / 4 days = 81.25 kilometers per day
Total distance driven = Distance driven per day x Number of days = 81.25 kilometers/day x 4 days = 325 kilometers

Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance to be driven.
To find the remaining distance, we subtract the total distance Bernice has driven from the total distance from San Diego to New York City:

Remaining distance = Total distance from San Diego to New York City - Total distance driven
= 1955 kilometers - 325 kilometers

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of trucks dispatched for delivery.
Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks.

Step 2: Identify the number of tons of fertiliser each truck was carrying.
Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser initially dispatched.
Since there are 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total number of tons of fertiliser initially dispatched is:
20 trucks x 20 tons/truck = 400 tons of fertiliser

Step 4: Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
A quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures. To find the number of trucks that had mechanical failures, multiply the total number of trucks by 0.25 (which is equivalent to a quarter):
20 trucks x 0.25 = 5 trucks

Step 5: Calculate the number of tons of fertiliser that did not reach the farmers.
The trucks that had mechanical failures did not deliver their fertiliser loads. Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total number of tons of fertiliser that did not reach the farmers is:
5 trucks x 20 tons/truck = 100 tons of fertiliser

Step 6: Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers.
To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, subtract the number of tons of fertiliser that did not reach the farmers from the initial total:
400 tons of fertiliser - 100 tons of fertiliser = 300 tons of fertiliser

{The final answer is 300 tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day.}<|eot_id|>",300.0,300.0,300.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: James walks halfway to the store, which means he walks 2 miles (since the distance from home to the store is 4 miles).

Step 2: Since James walks 4 miles per hour, it will take him 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours to walk the first 2 miles (halfway to the store).

Step 3: However, James realizes he forgot something at home and has to walk back. This means he walks the 2 miles he just covered (from the halfway point to his home).

Step 4: It will take James 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours to walk the 2 miles back to his home.

Step 5: Since James has to walk back to his home, he essentially has to start over from scratch. This means he will have to walk the entire distance from his home to the store, which is 4 miles.

Step 6: It will take James 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour to walk the entire distance from his home to the store.

Step 7: Since James has to walk the entire distance from his home to the store, the total time it takes him to reach the store (including the detour back home) is 1 hour.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Determine the weight of Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog.

Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, one-fourth of its weight would be:

60 pounds / 4 = 15 pounds

So, Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog weighs 15 pounds.

Step 2: Determine the weight of Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog.

Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, half of its weight would be:

60 pounds / 2 = 30 pounds

So, Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog weighs 30 pounds.

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of Elijah's dogs.

Elijah has two dogs: one that weighs 15 pounds and another that weighs 30 pounds. To find the total weight of his dogs, we add their individual weights:

15 pounds + 30 pounds = 45 pounds

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of Kory's dog and Elijah's dogs together.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, and Elijah's dogs together weigh 45 pounds. To find the total weight of Kory's dog and Elijah's dogs together, we add their individual weights:

60 pounds + 45 pounds = 105 pounds

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of weekdays and weekend days Mason eats carrots.

* Weekdays: Monday to Friday (5 days)
* Weekend: Saturday and Sunday (2 days)

Step 2: Calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays.

* Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays. Since there are 5 weekdays, the total number of carrots eaten on weekdays is:
4 carrots/day × 5 days = 20 carrots

Step 3: Calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekend days.

* Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday. Since there are 2 weekend days, the total number of carrots eaten on weekend days is:
5 carrots/day × 2 days = 10 carrots

Step 4: Calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week.

* Add the total number of carrots eaten on weekdays (20) to the total number of carrots eaten on weekend days (10):

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Doxa sliced the apples into 8 pieces. This means we have a total of 8 slices.

Step 2: Doxa ate 1 slice. This means she ate 1/8 of the total slices.

Step 3: Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa. Since Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.

Step 4: Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister. Since her sister ate 2 slices, her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Step 5: To find the total number of slices eaten by all three, we add up the number of slices each person ate:

* Doxa ate 1 slice
* Her sister ate 2 slices
* Her brother ate 3 slices

Total number of slices eaten = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Since Mia is 40 years old and Emma is 16 years older, we can find Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
= 40 + 16
= 56

Step 2: Since Mia is younger than Emma, we know that Mia's age is less than Emma's age. Therefore, Mia's age is 40.

Step 3: To find the average of their ages, we need to add their ages and divide by 2.

Step 4: Add Mia's age (40) and Emma's age (56):

Total age = Mia's age + Emma's age
= 40 + 56

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Dan adds 3 thorn bushes. This means we need to know how many roses are on each thorn bush and how many thorns are on each rose.

Step 2: Each rose bush has 25 roses. This means we need to multiply the number of thorn bushes by 25 to get the total number of roses.

Step 3: Since Dan adds 3 thorn bushes, we multiply 3 by 25 to get the total number of roses:

3 thorn bushes x 25 roses per thorn bush = 75 roses

Step 4: Each rose has 8 thorns. This means we need to multiply the total number of roses by 8 to get the total number of thorns.

Step 5: Multiply the total number of roses (75) by 8 to get the total number of thorns:

75 roses x 8 thorns per rose = 600 thorns

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Harry lost 9 hours last night.
* James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept.

Step 2: Let's denote the number of hours Harry slept as H.

Since Harry lost 9 hours, we can say that H = 9.

Step 3: James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. This means that James slept 2/3H.

Step 4: We need to find the difference between the number of hours Harry slept (H) and the number of hours James slept (2/3H).

To do this, we can subtract 2/3H from H:

H - 2/3H

Step 5: Simplify the expression:

H - 2/3H = (1 - 2/3)H

= (3/3 - 2/3)H

= (1/3)H

Step 6: Substitute the value of H (9) into the simplified expression:

(1/3)H = (1/3)(9)

= 3

Step 7: This means that Harry slept 3 hours more than James.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given
Amy lost 20 more friends than Lily. This means that Amy had 20 more friends than Lily initially, and then lost 20 more friends.

Step 2: Find out how many friends Amy had initially
Since Lily made 50 friends, and Amy lost 20 more friends than Lily, Amy initially had 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Step 3: Find out how many friends Amy has now
Amy lost 20 friends, so she has 70 - 20 = 50 friends now.

Step 4: Find out how many friends Lily has now
Lily made 50 friends, so she still has 50 friends.

Step 5: Find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together
To find the total number of friends, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have now:

Lily has 50 friends, and Amy has 50 friends, so together they have:
50 + 50 = 100

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Violetta has $20 to spend on art crayons.

Step 2: Violetta makes a purchase of art crayons in 5 different colors.

Step 3: Each crayon costs $2.

Step 4: To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy with her $20, we can divide the amount she has ($20) by the cost of one crayon ($2).

$20 ÷ $2 = 10

Step 5: Violetta can buy 10 crayons with her $20.

Step 6: Since Violetta wants to buy 5 different colors, she will need to buy at least 5 crayons to get all 5 colors.

Step 7: Violetta has $20 and buys 5 crayons, which costs:

5 crayons × $2 per crayon = $10

Step 8: Violetta still has money left after buying the 5 crayons. To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the cost of the crayons ($10) from the initial amount she had ($20).

$20 - $10 = $10

Step 9: Violetta will get $10 in change.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of slices needed for John's companions.

Since each companion needs 4 slices, and there are 20 fingers (i.e., companions), we can calculate the total number of slices needed as follows:

20 companions × 4 slices per companion = 80 slices

Step 2: Determine the number of pizzas needed to obtain 80 slices.

Since pizzas are sold in 8-slice portions, we need to divide the total number of slices needed (80) by 8 to find the number of pizzas required:

80 slices ÷ 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

{The final answer is} 10 pizzas.<|eot_id|>",10.0,10.0,10.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
John arm wrestles 20 people.

Step 2: Understand the condition
He beats 80% of the people he arm wrestled.

Step 3: Calculate the number of people John beats
80% of 20 is equal to (80/100) * 20 = 16. So, John beats 16 people.

Step 4: Calculate the number of people John loses to
Since John beats 16 people, he must have lost to the remaining people. To find the number of people John lost to, subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

20 (total people) - 16 (people John beat) = 4

Step 5: Write the answer
John lost to 4 people.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Let's start by identifying the information we know:

* The dictionary costs $4.
* A magazine costs half as much as a book. (This statement doesn't provide any direct information, but it's important to note it for later.)

Step 2: Since we know the cost of the dictionary, we can use this information to find the cost of a book. Let's assume the cost of the book is x.

Step 3: Since a magazine costs half as much as a book, the cost of a magazine is x/2.

Step 4: We also know that a pen costs $1 less than a magazine. So, the cost of a pen is x/2 - 1.

Step 5: Now, let's substitute the cost of the dictionary ($4) into our equation. Since the dictionary is a book, the cost of the book (x) is equal to $4.

x = 4

Step 6: Now that we know the cost of the book, we can find the cost of a magazine.

x/2 = 4/2
x/2 = 2

Step 7: Finally, we can find the cost of the pen.

Cost of pen = x/2 - 1
= 2 - 1
= 1

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total amount of money spent on equipment ($400000).

Step 2: Identify the percentage of faulty equipment (40%).

Step 3: Calculate the value of the faulty equipment:

Value of faulty equipment = (40% of $400000)
= (0.40 x $400000)
= $160000

Step 4: Since the faulty equipment was returned to the seller, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is the original amount minus the value of the faulty equipment:

Total amount spent on functioning equipment = $400000 - $160000
= $240000

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many rolls Mrs. Sherman started with.
The problem states that Mrs. Sherman made ""a couple"" of bread rolls, which is an informal way of saying two. So, she started with 2 rolls.

Step 2: Determine how many rolls Mrs. Sherman gave to her children.
Mrs. Sherman gave one roll to each of her 6 children, so she gave away 6 rolls.

Step 3: Determine how many rolls Mrs. Sherman has left.
Mrs. Sherman started with 2 rolls and gave away 6 rolls, so she has 2 - 6 = 2 - 6 = -4 rolls left. (Note: This step might seem strange, but we'll come back to it later.)

Step 4: Determine how many pieces Mrs. Sherman broke each of the remaining rolls into.
Mrs. Sherman broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces. Since she has only 1 roll left (from Step 3), she broke it into 8 pieces.

Step 5: Determine the total number of pieces Mrs. Sherman gave to the chickens.
Mrs. Sherman gave away the 8 pieces from the last remaining roll. Since she didn't give away any pieces from the other roll (which she didn't have), the total number of pieces she gave to the chickens is simply 8.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Ray has 25 lollipops initially.

Step 2: Ray keeps 5 lollipops for himself.

Step 3: To find the number of lollipops Ray has left, we subtract the number of lollipops he kept (5) from the initial number (25):

25 - 5 = 20

Step 4: Ray shares the remaining lollipops (20) equally among his four friends.

Step 5: To find the number of lollipops each friend receives, we divide the remaining lollipops (20) by the number of friends (4):

20 ÷ 4 = 5

Step 6: Each of Ray's four friends receives 5 lollipops.

Step 2: Identify the number of days Jeff works per week
According to the problem, Jeff has to work 5 times a week.

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Jeff walks per week

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the amount of money Sally has earned this week.

Since Sally's bank account held $200 at the start of the week and now holds $420, we can calculate the amount of money she has earned this week by subtracting the initial balance from the final balance:

$420 (final balance) - $200 (initial balance) = $220

Step 2: Determine the amount of money that should have been paid to Sally this week.

Since Sally's weekly wage should be $300, we can assume that she should have received $300 into her bank account this week.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money that was withheld from Sally's wage.

To find out how much was withheld, we need to subtract the amount of money Sally has actually received from her bank account ($220) from the amount of money she should have received ($300):

$300 (should have received) - $220 (actually received) = $80

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The book has 200 pages.
* Mike plans to read 10 pages a day.
* The assignment is to be completed within 30 days.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pages Mike needs to read

* Since the book has 200 pages, Mike needs to read all 200 pages to complete the assignment.

Step 3: Calculate the number of days Mike needs to read the book

* To calculate the number of days, we can divide the total number of pages (200) by the number of pages Mike reads per day (10).

200 pages ÷ 10 pages/day = 20 days

Step 4: Check if Mike will finish the book within the given time frame

* The assignment is to be completed within 30 days. Since Mike needs 20 days to finish the book, he will finish the book within the given time frame.

Step 5: Calculate the number of days before the paper Mike will finish his reading

* Since Mike will finish the book within the given time frame, we don't need to calculate the number of days before the paper. However, if we want to know how many days he has left before the paper, we can subtract the number of days he needs to finish the book (20) from the total number of days (30).

30 days - 20 days = 10 days

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* 10 students like to bake
* 5 students like to play basketball

Step 2: Identify the unknowns

* Number of students who like to play video games
* Number of students who like to play music

Step 3: Analyze the situation

* Since the rest of the students like to either play video games or play music, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of students who like to play video games or music.

Let's say the number of students who like to play video games is x. Then, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball, which is 2 × 5 = 10. This means the total number of students who like to play video games or music is x + 10.

Step 4: Set up an equation

Since the total number of students is 50, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 + 10 (since 5 students like to play basketball) = 50

Step 5: Solve for x

Combine like terms:

x + 20 = 50

Subtract 20 from both sides:

x = 30

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the amount of money Marissa has initially.
Marissa bought a ball for $20, so she spent $20. She has $80 left.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Marissa has after buying the ball.
Marissa has $80 initially, and she spent $20 on the ball. To find the total amount of money she has, subtract $20 from $80:

$80 - $20 = $60

Step 3: Determine how much money Marissa has left to buy candy bars for Jimmy.
Marissa has $60 left after buying the ball. She wants to use this money to buy candy bars for Jimmy.

Step 4: Calculate how many candy bars Marissa can buy with the remaining money.
Each candy bar costs $5, so to find out how many Marissa can buy, divide the remaining money ($60) by the cost of one candy bar ($5):

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

Step 5: Determine the final answer.
Marissa can buy 12 candy bars for Jimmy with the remaining money.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Susan planned to divide the 100 cookies equally among her 6 nephews.

Initially, there are 100 cookies.

Step 2: Susan's husband snuck 4 cookies for himself.

This means that 4 cookies are taken away from the total amount. To find the new total, subtract 4 from 100:

100 - 4 = 96

So, there are now 96 cookies left.

Step 3: Divide the remaining cookies among the 6 nephews.

To divide the cookies equally, divide the remaining 96 cookies by 6:

96 ÷ 6 = 16

Step 4: Each nephew will get the same amount of cookies.

Since the cookies are divided equally, each nephew will get the same number of cookies.

{The final answer is} 16 cookies per nephew.<|eot_id|>",16.0,16.0,16.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given
We know that Brown's home is 200 acres, and Market Smith's agricultural land is 100 acres more than twice the size of Brown's home.

Step 2: Identify the unknown variable
Let's call the size of Brown's home ""x"". Then, Market Smith's agricultural land is 100 acres more than twice the size of Brown's home, which can be written as:

2x + 100

Step 3: Find the size of Market Smith's agricultural land
We know that Brown's home is 200 acres, so we can set up the equation:

x = 200

Now, we can substitute this value into the equation for Market Smith's agricultural land:

2x + 100 = 2(200) + 100
= 400 + 100
= 500

So, Market Smith's agricultural land is 500 acres.

Step 4: Find the total acres of both farms
To find the total acres, we add the size of Brown's home (200 acres) to the size of Market Smith's agricultural land (500 acres):

200 + 500 = 700

                    question:
                    a three-toed raty, generally carefully, and only sleeps when he is up in his trunk!  for a course of berries, it allows the rath 4 hours to completed the traveling down the trees. pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.  assuming he picks the same number of berries on each trip, what is the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The raty wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Since it takes 4 hours to travel down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up, we need to find the least number of berries it can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the number of trips
To collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to find the number of trips the raty needs to make. Since each trip takes 4 hours, we can divide the total time (8 hours) by the time per trip (4 hours):

8 hours ÷ 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Step 3: Calculate the total number of berries needed per trip
Since the raty makes 2 trips, it needs to collect 24 berries in 2 trips. To find the number of berries needed per trip, we can divide the total number of berries (24) by the number of trips (2):

24 berries ÷ 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Step 4: Check if the answer is feasible
Since the raty picks the same number of berries on each trip, it needs to pick up at least 12 berries per trip. This is because it needs to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, and 12 berries per trip is the minimum required to achieve this.

Step 5: Verify the answer
Let's verify that picking up 12 berries per trip is indeed feasible. If the raty picks up 12 berries on each of its 2 trips, it will collect a total of:

12 berries per trip × 2 trips = 24 berries

This matches the total number of berries the raty wants to collect in 8 hours.

{The final answer is 12 berries per trip.}<|eot_id|>",12.0,12.0,12.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages of his book.

Step 2: Determine how many pages James reads before going to sleep.
James reads 18 pages of his book before going to sleep.

Step 3: Calculate how many groups of 3 pages James reads.
To do this, we can divide the total number of pages James reads (18) by the number of pages he reads in 10 minutes (3):

18 ÷ 3 = 6

So, James reads 6 groups of 3 pages.

Step 4: Calculate the total time James spends reading.
Since it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can multiply the number of groups of 3 pages (6) by the time it takes to read 3 pages (10 minutes):

6 × 10 = 60

Step 5: The final answer is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days.

To find the total distance Sofie will walk, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days:

10 miles/day × 7 days = 70 miles

Step 2: Sofie says she will walk twice as far as Brian. This means that the distance Brian will walk is half the distance Sofie will walk.

To find the distance Brian will walk, we divide the total distance Sofie will walk by 2:

70 miles ÷ 2 = 35 miles

Step 3: Since Brian will walk for 7 days, we need to multiply the daily distance by the number of days to find the total distance:

35 miles ÷ day × 7 days = {The final answer is} 35 miles<|eot_id|>",35.0,35.0,35.0

                    question:
                    rani is obsessed with sports cars. she wonders what the faster car ever made can go so she looks it up. what she finds out is that the fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. the 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car. the best car can go 120 miles per hour. how fast does the faster car go?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
* The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car.
* The best car (which is the fastest car) can go 120 miles per hour.

Step 2: Identify the unknown variable

* The speed of the 2nd fastest car (let's call it x)

Step 3: Use the given information to set up an equation

* The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so the speed of the fastest car is 1.25x.
* The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so the speed of the 2nd fastest car is 5 times the average car's speed. Let's call the average car's speed y, so x = 5y.
* The fastest car (which is the best car) can go 120 miles per hour, so 1.25x = 120.

Step 4: Substitute the expression for x into the equation

* Substitute x = 5y into the equation 1.25x = 120.
* This gives us the equation 1.25(5y) = 120.

Step 5: Simplify the equation

* Multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to get rid of the parentheses:
	+ 6.25y = 120
* Divide both sides of the equation by 6.25 to solve for y:
	+ y = 120 / 6.25
	+ y = 19.2

Step 6: Find the speed of the 2nd fastest car

* Since x = 5y, we can substitute y = 19.2 into the equation:
	+ x = 5(19.2)
	+ x = 96

Step 7: Find the speed of the fastest car

* Since the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, we can multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25:
	+ 1.25(96) = 120

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Tyrion goes out three times a night. This means he uses a new face mask three times every night.

Step 2: Since Tyrion goes out three times a night, he uses a total of 3 face masks every night.

Step 3: We need to find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days would be equivalent to 48 hours.

Step 4: Tyrion goes out three times every night, and there are 2 nights in 2 days (48 hours). So, he goes out a total of 6 times (3 times a night, for 2 nights).

Step 5: Since Tyrion uses a new face mask every time he goes out, he uses a total of 6 face masks every 2 days.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Eve had 20 pieces of pomelo initially.

Step 2: After giving some pomelos to her friend, Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount. This means that Eve gave away some pomelos, and the remaining pomelos are 1/4 of the original 20.

Step 3: To find the number of pomelos Eve gave away, we need to calculate the value of 1/4 of 20.

Step 4: To do this, we can multiply 20 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 20 by 4.

20 ÷ 4 = 5

Step 5: So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos (1/4 of the original 20).

Step 6: To find the number of pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left (5) from the original number of pomelos (20).

20 - 5 = 15

Step 7: Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. We know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. To find the number of sheep Charleston has, we can multiply Seattle's number by 4:

Charleston's sheep = Seattle's sheep × 4
= 20 × 4
= 80

So, Charleston has 80 sheep.

3. We know that Toulouse wants twice as few sheep as Charleston. To find the number of sheep Toulouse has, we can take half of Charleston's number:

Toulouse's sheep = Charleston's sheep ÷ 2
= 80 ÷ 2
= 40

So, Toulouse has 40 sheep.

4. To find the total number of sheep all three cities have together, we add the number of sheep each city has:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, and they lose half their color. This means that the color of the tomatoes is reduced by half when they are cooked into sauce.

Step 2: Understand the quantity of tomatoes
Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.

Step 3: Determine the total quantity of sauce made
Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.

Step 4: Convert the quantity of sauce to cans
Since each can contains 16 ounces of sauce, we can convert the total quantity of sauce to cans by dividing the total quantity of sauce (32 ounces) by the quantity of sauce in each can (16 ounces).

32 ounces (sauce) ÷ 16 ounces (can) = 2 cans

Step 5: Determine the total number of tomatoes used

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers (elves) initially.

Step 2: A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. To find the number of elves that quit, we need to calculate a third of 60.

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, 20 elves quit. This leaves us with:

60 - 20 = 40

Step 3: The remaining 40 elves are left. However, 10 of them quit after kids kick their shins.

Step 4: To find the number of elves that quit after kids kick their shins, we subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves.

40 - 10 = 30

Step 2: Identify the number of automatic cars - 12

Step 3: Identify the number of manual cars - 4

Step 4: Identify the number of semi-automatic cars (rest) - Since there are 20 homes in total, and 12 are automatic and 4 are manual, the remaining number of homes are semi-automatic. To find this, subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of homes:

20 (total homes) - 12 (automatic homes) - 4 (manual homes) = 20 - 16 = 4

So, there are 4 semi-automatic homes.

Step 5: Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic homes:

To find the percentage, divide the number of semi-automatic homes by the total number of homes and multiply by 100:

                    question:
                    a water tank is filled with 120 liters of water. celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her small garden. she was then able to collect rainwater that is twice as much as what was leaves. how many liters of water are in the tank now?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Initial amount of water in the tank = 120 liters

Step 2: Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank to water her small garden. This means the amount of water in the tank decreases by 90 liters.

New amount of water in the tank = 120 - 90 = 30 liters

Step 3: Celine collects rainwater. The problem states that the rainwater collected is twice as much as what was left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left in the tank, the rainwater collected is twice that amount.

Rainwater collected = 2 x 30 = 60 liters

Step 4: Add the rainwater collected to the remaining water in the tank.

New amount of water in the tank = 30 + 60 = 90 liters

{The final answer is 90 liters.}<|eot_id|>",90.0,90.0,90.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the time period Susan is working.
Susan works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m., which means she works for 3 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of 10-minute intervals in the given time period.
Since Susan works for 3 hours, we need to convert this to 10-minute intervals. There are 6 10-minute intervals in an hour, so:
3 hours x 6 intervals/hour = 18 intervals

Step 3: Subtract the time Susan pauses for half an hour.
Susan pauses for 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 3 intervals (30 minutes ÷ 10 minutes per interval = 3 intervals). So, we subtract these intervals from the total:
18 intervals - 3 intervals = 15 intervals

Step 4: Calculate Susan's earnings for the remaining 15 intervals.
Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, she earns:
$5 x 15 intervals = $75

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies.
Step 2: April needs twice as many plant pots for the roses. To find out how many, we multiply the number of pots needed for the daisies by 2:

30 (pots for daisies) × 2 = 60 (pots for roses)

Step 3: April needs a total of 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots for the daisies and roses combined.
Step 4: April already had 100 plant pots from the garden center before she knew how many she needed. To find out how many she has in total, we add the number of pots she needs to the number of pots she already has:

100 (pots already bought) + 90 (pots needed) = 190

Step 5: Therefore, April has a total of 190 plant pots.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Katelyn sees 50 angels flying above the nearby forest.

No fairies are mentioned yet, so we don't need to worry about them for now.

Step 2: After about twenty minutes, one of Katelyn's friends sees half as many fairies as Katelyn saw angels (50) come from the east and join the fairies that were already there.

We need to find out how many fairies were there initially. Since Katelyn's friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw angels (50), we can calculate the number of fairies initially:

50 angels × 0.5 (since half as many) = 25 fairies

So, 25 fairies were there initially. Katelyn's friend sees 25 fairies coming from the east and joins them, making a total of:

25 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 50 fairies

Step 3: Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.

We need to subtract the number of fairies that flew away from the total number of fairies:

50 (total fairies) - 30 (fairies that flew away) = 20 fairies

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the original cost of 2 packs of razors

Each pack costs $4.00, and Heather is buying 2 packs. So, the original cost is:

2 packs x $4.00 per pack = $8.00

Step 2: Apply the buy one get one free discount

Since Heather is buying 2 packs, she is essentially getting 2 packs for the price of 1 pack. So, the discount is:

$8.00 (original cost) - $4.00 (price of 1 pack) = $4.00

Step 3: Apply the $2.00 coupon

Heather has a $2.00 coupon, which she can apply to the discounted price:

$4.00 (discounted price) - $2.00 (coupon) = $2.00

Step 4: Calculate the total cost after the discount and coupon

Heather has paid $2.00 for 2 packs of razors. Since each pack contains 4 razors, she has 2 packs x 4 razors per pack = 8 razors.

To find the cost per razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors:

$2.00 ÷ 8 razors = $0.25 per razor

Step 5: Convert the answer to cents

To convert the answer to cents, we multiply the decimal answer by 100:

$0.25 per razor x 100 = 25 cents per razor

{The final answer is 25 cents per razor}.<|eot_id|>",25.0,25.0,25.0

                    sophia and rose took together to the market to buy onions and potatoes. rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes sophia bought. if rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, how many onions and potatoes in total did sophia buy at the market?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Let's say Sophia bought x onions and potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, Rose bought 4x onions and potatoes.

Step 2: We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4x onions and potatoes, we can set up the equation:

4x = 12 (onions) and 4x = 4 (potatoes)

Step 3: To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 12/4 = 3 (onions) and x = 4/4 = 1 (potatoes)

Step 4: Since Sophia bought x onions and potatoes, and Rose bought 4x onions and potatoes, we can find the total number of onions and potatoes bought by Sophia and Rose together:

Total number of onions = x + 4x = 5x
Total number of potatoes = x + 4x = 5x

Step 5: Since we already found the value of x to be 3 (onions) and 1 (potatoes), we can substitute these values into the equation:

Total number of onions = 5x = 5(3) = 15
Total number of potatoes = 5x = 5(1) = 5

Step 6: Finally, we can add the total number of onions and potatoes to find the total number of onions and potatoes bought by Sophia and Rose together:

Total number of onions and potatoes = 15 + 5 = 20

{The final answer is 20 onions and potatoes in total did Sophia buy at the market.}<|eot_id|>",4.0,4.0,20.0
"shiloh is 44 years old today.  in 7 years, he wil be three times as old as his nephew.  how old is his nephew today?","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

                    question:
                    shiloh is 44 years old today.  in 7 years, he wil be three times as old as his nephew.  how old is his nephew today?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's define the variables:

* Shiloh's current age = 44
* Shiloh's age in 7 years = x (we don't know this yet)
* Shiloh's nephew's current age = y (we want to find this)

Step 2: According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This means that:

x + 7 = 3(y + 7)

Step 3: Simplify the equation by distributing the 3 and combining like terms:

x + 7 = 3y + 21

Step 4: Since Shiloh is 44 years old today, his age in 7 years is:

x = 44 + 7
x = 51

Step 5: Substitute this value of x into the equation from Step 3:

51 + 7 = 3y + 21

Step 6: Simplify the equation further:

58 = 3y + 21

Step 7: Subtract 21 from both sides to isolate the term with y:

37 = 3y

Step 8: Divide both sides by 3 to solve for y:

y = 37/3
y = 12.33 (round to the nearest whole number, since ages can't be fractional)

Step 9: Since we want to find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 from his age in 7 years:

y - 7 = 12.33 - 7
y - 7 = 5.33 (round to the nearest whole number)
y - 7 = 5

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Max bought 16 winter stamps, which have a snowflake design. Let's call the number of snowflake stamps x.

Step 2: Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. This means the number of truck stamps is x + 3.

Step 3: Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. This means the number of rose stamps is (x + 3) - 9.

Step 4: The total number of stamps Max bought is the sum of the snowflake, truck, and rose stamps.

Let's add up the number of stamps:

x (snowflake) + (x + 3) (truck) + ((x + 3) - 9) (rose)

Combine like terms:

x + x + 3 + (x + 3) - 9

Simplify:

3x + 3 - 9

Step 5: Simplify the expression:

3x - 6

Step 6: Add the 16 winter stamps (snowflake stamps) to the total:

3x - 6 + 16

Step 7: Combine the constant terms:

3x + 10

Step 8: The final answer is the sum of the expressions:

3x + 10

{The final answer is 3x + 10}

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. To find the time it takes for the cat to eat 1 sausage, we can divide the total time (30 minutes) by the number of sausages eaten (9).

Time taken by cat to eat 1 sausage = 30 minutes ÷ 9 = 3.33 minutes (approximately)

Step 2: The dog eats the same number of sausages (9) in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages, the dog will take:

Time taken by dog to eat 9 sausages = 30 minutes × (2/3) = 20 minutes

Step 3: To find the time taken by the dog to eat 1 sausage, we can divide the total time taken by the dog (20 minutes) by the number of sausages eaten (9).

Time taken by dog to eat 1 sausage = 20 minutes ÷ 9 = 2.22 minutes (approximately)

Step 4: To calculate the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we can add the time taken by each to eat 1 sausage and divide by 2.

Average time taken = (Time taken by cat to eat 1 sausage + Time taken by dog to eat 1 sausage) / 2
= (3.33 minutes + 2.22 minutes) / 2

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Calculate the discount amount
Since the jeans are 25% off, we need to find 25% of the original price ($40). To do this, we can multiply the original price by 0.25 (since 25% is the same as 0.25).

$40 x 0.25 = $10

So, the discount amount is $10.

Step 2: Calculate the new price of the jeans
To find the new price, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

The new price of the jeans is $30.

Step 3: Calculate the change Mike will receive
Mike pays with a $50 bill and the new price of the jeans is $30. To find the change, we subtract the new price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will receive $20 in change.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Joseph has 3 times as many laptops as Martha. Martha initially has some number of laptops, and Joseph has 3 times that amount.

Step 2: Martha buys 5 more notebooks
Martha buys 5 more notebooks, and now has a total of 7 notebooks. This means that Martha's initial number of notebooks is 7 - 5 = 2.

Step 3: Find Martha's initial number of laptops
Since Martha has 2 notebooks initially, and she buys 5 more, she now has a total of 7 notebooks. We don't know how many laptops she had initially, but we know that Joseph has 3 times as many laptops as Martha. Let's call Martha's initial number of laptops ""x"". Then, Joseph has 3x laptops.

Step 4: Find the difference between Joseph's and Martha's laptops
Since Martha has 2 notebooks initially, and Joseph has 3 times as many laptops as Martha, Joseph has 3x laptops. We don't know what x is, but we know that Martha now has 7 notebooks. To find the difference between Joseph's and Martha's laptops, we need to subtract Martha's new number of notebooks from Joseph's number of laptops.

Step 5: Calculate the difference
Joseph has 3x laptops, and Martha has 7 notebooks. To find the difference, we subtract Martha's new number of notebooks from Joseph's number of laptops:

3x - 7

Step 6: Simplify the expression
We can simplify the expression by subtracting 7 from 3x:

3x - 7

Step 7: The final answer is
We don't know what x is, but we know that Joseph has 3 times as many laptops as Martha. To find the final answer, we need to know how many more laptops Joseph has than Martha.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the students.

Each student sold 10 lollipops on average, and there are 30 students. To find the total number of lollipops sold, we multiply the number of students by the average number of lollipops sold per student:

30 students x 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling lollipops.

The cost of each lollipop is $0.8, and the students sold a total of 300 lollipops. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of lollipops sold by the price of each lollipop:

300 lollipops x $0.8/lollipop = $240

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the lollipops purchased by the students.

The students bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, and they sold a total of 300 lollipops. To find the total cost of the lollipops purchased, we multiply the number of lollipops sold by the cost of each lollipop:

300 lollipops x $0.5/lollipop = $150

Step 4: Calculate the profit made by the students.

The total revenue from selling lollipops is $240, and the total cost of purchasing the lollipops is $150. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

$240 (revenue) - $150 (cost) = $90

                    adrianne is collecting different kinds of beads for making bracelets. her grandmother gave her 20 metallic beads. her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, and her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave.  how many beads did adrianne have altogether?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Adrianne's grandmother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Adrianne already has 20 beads.

Step 2: Adrianne's sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother.

This means we need to know how many beads her mother gave. Let's call this number ""x"". Then, Adrianne's sister gave her x + 10 beads.

Step 3: Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave.

This means Adrianne's friend gave her 2x beads.

Step 4: Add up the number of beads Adrianne received from her grandmother, sister, and friend.

Adrianne already had 20 beads from her grandmother. She received x + 10 beads from her sister and 2x beads from her friend. Adding these up, we get:

20 + (x + 10) + 2x

Step 5: Simplify the expression by combining like terms.

20 + x + 10 + 2x = 20 + 3x + 10

Step 6: Combine the constants and variables.

20 + 10 = 30, so we get:

30 + 3x

Step 7: Add up all the beads Adrianne received.

30 + 3x is the total number of beads Adrianne received. To find the final answer, we need to know the value of x. However, the problem doesn't specify how many beads her mother gave, so we can't find the exact answer. We can only express the answer in terms of x.

{The final answer is 30 + 3x, where x is the number of beads her mother gave.}<|eot_id|>",90.0,90.0,3.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies available

Each guest walked a plate of 15 cookies, and there were 100 guests. To find the total number of cookies, multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest walked:

100 guests x 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies given to the church

The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church. To find the number of cookies given, multiply the total number of cookies by 1/2:

1500 cookies x 1/2 = 750 cookies

Step 3: Calculate the number of cookies each church received

Each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find the number of churches, divide the number of cookies given by 15:

750 cookies ÷ 15 cookies/church = 50 churches

Step 4: Check the units

The problem asks for the number of ""churches"", so we need to make sure our answer is in the correct units. Since we divided the number of cookies by 15, our answer is in the correct units (cookies per church).

{The final answer is 50 churches}.<|eot_id|>",50.0,50.0,50.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total distance Bernice needs to cover, which is the distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York, which is approximately 1955 kilometers.

Step 2: Identify the distance Bernice has already driven, which is 325 kilometers, over a period of 4 days.

Step 3: To find out how many kilometers Bernice has driven in total, multiply the distance driven per day by the number of days:

Distance driven per day = 325 kilometers ÷ 4 days = 81.25 kilometers per day

Total distance driven = Distance driven per day × Number of days = 81.25 kilometers/day × 4 days = 325 kilometers

Step 4: Subtract the total distance driven from the total distance needed to cover to find out how much distance Bernice still needs to drive:

Total distance needed to cover = 1955 kilometers
Total distance driven = 325 kilometers

Distance still needed to drive = Total distance needed to cover - Total distance driven = 1955 kilometers - 325 kilometers = 1630 kilometers

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of movies Jill and her companions watch on Saturday.
They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

Step 2: Identify the number of movies they watch on Sunday.
They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. Since they watch 4 movies on Saturday, they will watch:

4/2 = 2 movies on Sunday

Step 3: Identify the total number of movies they watch in a weekend (Saturday and Sunday).
They watch 4 movies on Saturday and 2 movies on Sunday, so the total number of movies in a weekend is:

4 + 2 = 6 movies

Step 4: Identify the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks.
Since they watch movies every weekend, they will watch movies for 4 weekends. The total number of movies they will watch in 4 weeks is:

6 movies/weekend × 4 weekends = 24 movies

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: James walks to the store, but then realizes he forgot something and has to walk back. This means he will make two trips: one to the store, and one back home.

Step 2: The distance from James' home to the store is 4 miles. Since he has to walk back home, we need to calculate the total distance he travels.

Step 3: The total distance James travels is the distance to the store (4 miles) plus the distance back home (4 miles), which is:

4 miles (to the store) + 4 miles (back home) = 8 miles

Step 4: Since James walks at a rate of 4 miles per hour, we need to calculate how long it takes him to travel the total distance of 8 miles.

Step 5: To find the time it takes James to travel 8 miles, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

Plugging in the values, we get:

Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour

Step 6: Simplifying the calculation, we get:

Time = 2 hours

Step 7: Since James makes two trips (one to the store and one back home), we need to double the time it takes him to travel 8 miles.

Time = 2 hours x 2 = 4 hours

{The final answer is 4 hours.}<|eot_id|>",2.0,2.0,4.0

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Raymond starts with $21.

**Step 2:** He buys $11 from his allowance, which means he subtracts $11 from his initial amount. So, he now has:

$21 - $11 = $10

**Step 3:** He spends $5 on a comic book, which means he subtracts $5 from his current amount. So, he now has:

$10 - $5 = $5

**Step 4:** He spends $19 on a puzzle, which means he subtracts $19 from his current amount. So, he now has:

$5 - $19 = -$14

**Wait, what?** How can he have -$14? That's not possible! This means that Raymond has overspent his money. He doesn't have enough money to buy the puzzle.

**Let's assume** that Raymond had enough money to buy the puzzle, and he actually has $5 left. This is not the correct solution, but let's continue for the sake of the problem.

**Step 5:** Raymond is left with $5.

                    question:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that a towel costs 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. We need to find the total number of bolts needed to make the towel.

Step 2: Identify the amount of blue fiber needed
The problem states that the towel costs 2 bolts of blue fiber. This means that 2 bolts of blue fiber are required to make the towel.

Step 3: Identify the amount of white fiber needed
The problem states that the towel costs half that much white fiber as blue fiber. Since 2 bolts of blue fiber are needed, half that much white fiber would be:

2 bolts (blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt (white fiber)

So, 1 bolt of white fiber is needed to make the towel.

Step 4: Add the blue and white fiber together
To find the total number of bolts needed, we add the blue and white fiber together:

2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts

                    question:
                    the great dragons was perg, sat high atop mount farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 1000 feet.  polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  but when polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. if holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the maximum distance Polly can throw the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

When holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding it. Since Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet when not holding the gemstone, three times that distance would be:

400 feet x 3 = 1200 feet

So, when holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet.

Step 2: Determine the distance within which the dragon's flames can reach.

The dragon's flames can reach anything within a distance of 1000 feet. To find the distance outside of the reach of the dragon's flames, we need to subtract the maximum distance the dragon's flames can reach from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.

1000 feet (dragon's flames) - 1200 feet (Polly's throw) = -200 feet

Step 3: Convert the negative result to a positive distance outside of the reach of the dragon's flames.

Since we subtracted 200 feet from 1200 feet, we need to add 200 feet to find the distance outside of the reach of the dragon's flames.

200 feet (added) = 200 feet

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Harry slept for 9 hours last night.
* James slept for 2/3 of what Harry slept.

Step 2: Express James' sleep time in terms of Harry's sleep time.

* Since James slept for 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can set up an equation: James' sleep time = (2/3) × Harry's sleep time
* Substitute Harry's sleep time (9 hours) into the equation: James' sleep time = (2/3) × 9
* Simplify the equation: James' sleep time = 6 hours

Step 3: Find the difference between Harry's sleep time and James' sleep time.

* Harry slept for 9 hours, and James slept for 6 hours. To find the difference, subtract James' sleep time from Harry's sleep time: 9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Violetta is buying crayons in 5 different colors. Since one crayon costs $2, the total cost of 5 crayons will be:

5 crayons x $2 per crayon = $10

Step 2: Violetta has prepared $20 for this purchase. We need to find out how much change she will get after buying the crayons.

Step 3: The total cost of the crayons is $10. To find the change, we subtract the cost from the amount Violetta has prepared:

$20 (prepared amount) - $10 (cost) = $10

Step 4: The result of Step 3 is $10, which is the amount of change Violetta will get.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of days it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car.

According to the problem, it takes 6 days to travel by bus, and it takes ""half as many days"" to travel by car. To find the number of days it takes to travel by car, we can divide 6 by 2:

6 days (by bus) ÷ 2 = 3 days (by car)

Step 2: Determine the total number of days Andrew will travel to Rochester by bus.

Since Andrew is traveling to Rochester by bus, it will take him 6 days to get there.

Step 3: Determine the total number of days Andrew will travel from Rochester back to New Jersey by bus.

Since Andrew is returning from Rochester to New Jersey by bus, it will also take him 6 days to get back.

Step 4: Add the total number of days Andrew will travel to and from Rochester.

Andrew will travel 6 days to get to Rochester, and 6 days to get back. To find the total number of days, we can add these two numbers together:

6 days (to Rochester) + 6 days (from Rochester) = 12 days

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: John arm wrestles 20 people. This means we know the total number of people he arm wrestled is 20.

Step 2: He beats 80% of the people he arm wrestled. To find the number of people he beat, we can multiply the total number of people he arm wrestled (20) by the percentage he beat (80%).

20 x 0.80 = 16

So, John beat 16 people.

Step 3: To find the number of people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat (16) from the total number of people he arm wrestled (20).

20 - 16 = 4

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

Step 1: Identify the distance Jeff walks each day.
Jeff walks to work and back, which means he walks a total distance of:

3 miles (to work) + 3 miles (back home) = 6 miles

Step 2: Determine how many days Jeff works in a week.
The problem states that Jeff has to work 5 evenings a week. This means he works 5 days.

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Jeff walks in a week.
Since Jeff walks 6 miles each day, and he works 5 days, the total distance he walks in a week is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that 10 students like to bake.
2. We know that 5 students like to play basketball.
3. The rest of the students (50 - 10 - 5 = 35) like to either play video games or play music.
4. Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who prefer playing basketball, we can set up an equation:

Number of students who like to play music = 2 × Number of students who like to play basketball
Let's say the number of students who like to play basketball is x. Then, the number of students who like to play music is 2x.

5. We know that the total number of students who like to play music or video games is 35. So, we can set up another equation:

Number of students who like to play music + Number of students who like to play video games = 35

Substituting the expression for the number of students who like to play music (2x), we get:

2x + Number of students who like to play video games = 35

6. We want to find the number of students who like to play video games. To do this, we can subtract 2x from both sides of the equation:

Number of students who like to play video games = 35 - 2x

7. Now, we can substitute x = 5 (since 5 students like to play basketball) into the equation:

Number of students who like to play video games = 35 - 2(5)
= 35 - 10
= 25

                    dale is selling butterscotch candies to raise money for his club at school. he doesn't have the candies yet and is instead just taking order ; he started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. then he ordered 100 more. how many does dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies and sold 150. To find out how many he has left, we need to subtract the number sold from the initial amount:

100 (initial amount) - 150 (candies sold) = -50

Wait, what? We can't have a negative number of candies! This means that Dale doesn't have enough candies to fulfill all the orders. He's short 50 candies.

Step 2: To make up for the shortage, Dale orders 100 more butterscotch candies. This brings the total number of candies he has to:

100 (initial amount) + 100 (new order) = 200

Step 3: Dale now has a total of 200 butterscotch candies. He wants to sell all of them. To find out how many he needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has from the initial amount:

200 (total candies) - 100 (initial amount) = 100

So, Dale needs to sell 100 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Comet Halley takes 75 years to orbit the sun. This means that Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill's dad was 75 years old, since that's the time it takes for the comet to come back around.

Step 2: Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. This means that Bill's dad was 45 years old (75 - 30 = 45) when the comet returned.

Step 3: Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since Bill's dad was 45 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 3 x 45 = 135 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Step 4: Since Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 135 years old, and the comet takes 75 years to orbit the sun, Bill must have been 60 years old (135 - 75 = 60) when he saw the comet for the first time.

{The final answer is 60 years old.}<|eot_id|>",15.0,15.0,60.0
"in 7 days, sofie said walk twice as far as brian. if sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, how many miles will brian walk in seven days?","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days. We need to find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days.

Step 2: Analyze the information
Sofie walks twice as far as Brian. This means that if Sofie walks x miles, Brian will walk x/2 miles.

Step 3: Calculate Sofie's total distance
Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days. To find her total distance, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days:

10 miles/day × 7 days = 70 miles

Step 4: Use the information to find Brian's distance
Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, Brian's distance will be half of Sofie's distance. We can set up an equation:

Brian's distance = Sofie's distance / 2

Substitute Sofie's total distance from Step 3:

Brian's distance = 70 miles / 2

Step 5: Calculate Brian's distance
Brian's distance = 35 miles

{The final answer is} Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.<|eot_id|>",35.0,35.0,7.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. This is the starting point.

Step 2: After giving some pomelos away, Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount. This means that the number of pomelos Eve has left is equal to 1/4 of the original 20 pieces.

Step 3: To find the number of pomelos Eve has left, we can multiply the original amount by the fraction 1/4. This gives us:

20 x (1/4) = 20/4 = 5

So Eve has 5 pieces of pomelos left.

Step 4: Since Eve gave away some pomelos, the number of pomelos she gave away is the difference between the original amount and the amount she has left. This is:

20 (original amount) - 5 (amount left) = 15

Eve gave away 15 pieces of pomelos.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of vehicles at the port.
We know that there were 2 containers of imported vehicles, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the initial number of vehicles at the port is:

2 containers x 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

Step 2: Determine the total number of vehicles at the port after the new containers were brought in.
We know that the total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the new containers were brought in. Since we already know the initial number of vehicles (10), we can subtract this from the total number of vehicles to find the number of new vehicles brought in:

30 (total vehicles) - 10 (initial vehicles) = 20 new vehicles

Step 3: Calculate the number of containers brought in on the second day.
Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of new vehicles (20) by 5 to find the number of containers brought in:

20 new vehicles ÷ 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Step 4: Calculate the number of units (vehicles) imported on the second day.
We know that each container brought in on the second day contains 5 vehicles. Therefore, the number of units (vehicles) imported on the second day is:

4 containers x 5 vehicles/container = 20 vehicles

Remaining water in the tank: 120 - 90 = 30 liters

Step 2: Celine was then able to collect rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank.

Remaining water in the tank: 30 liters
Rainwater collected: 2 x 30 = 60 liters

Step 3: Add the remaining water in the tank and the rainwater collected to find the new total amount of water in the tank.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many plant pots April needs for the daisies and roses.

* April buys 30 plant pots for the daisies.
* She needs twice as many for the roses, so she needs 2 x 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of plant pots April buys.

* For the daisies: 30 plant pots
* For the roses: 60 plant pots
* Total plant pots bought: 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots

Step 3: Calculate the total number of plant pots April has.

* April already has 100 plant pots from the garden center.
* She buys 90 plant pots from the book paintings, so she now has:
100 (already had) + 90 (newly bought) = 190 plant pots

Step 4: Calculate the number of plant pots April has left over.

* April started with 190 plant pots, but she only needs the ones for the daisies and roses.
* She has 30 plant pots for the daisies and 60 plant pots for the roses, so she uses a total of 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots.
* To find the number of plant pots left over, subtract the used plant pots from the total:
190 (total) - 90 (used) = 100 plant pots left over.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Let's say Sophia bought x onions and x potatoes. We don't know the exact value of x yet, but we'll use it as a placeholder for now.

Step 2: The problem states that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. So, Rose bought 4x onions and 4x potatoes.

Step 3: We know that Rose bought 12 onions, so we can set up the equation: 4x = 12. This equation represents the number of onions Rose bought, which is 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought.

Step 4: To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 12/4. This gives us x = 3.

Step 5: Now that we know Sophia bought 3 onions, we can find the number of potatoes she bought. Since Rose bought 4x potatoes, and x = 3, Rose bought 4(3) = 12 potatoes. This means Sophia bought the remaining potatoes, which is 12 - 4 = 8 potatoes.

Step 6: To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes she bought: 3 onions + 8 potatoes = 11.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's define the variables:
	* Shiloh's current age is 44 years old.
	* Shiloh's nephew's current age is x years old.
	* In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

Step 2: According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. We can write this as an equation:

51 (Shiloh's age in 7 years) = 3 × (Shiloh's nephew's age in 7 years)

Step 3: Since Shiloh's nephew's current age is x years old, his age in 7 years will be x + 7 years old. Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

51 = 3 × (x + 7)

Step 4: Simplify the equation by distributing the 3:

51 = 3x + 21

Step 5: Subtract 21 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x:

30 = 3x

Step 6: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:

x = 10

Step 7: Since x represents Shiloh's nephew's current age, we can conclude that his nephew is 10 years old today.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's identify the information we know:

* Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons.
* There are 20 red balloons.

Step 2: We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is:

2 pieces/balloon × 20 red balloons = 40 pieces

Step 3: Since Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, the remaining pieces must have been thrown at the yellow balloons. Let's calculate the number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons:

58 pieces (total) - 40 pieces (thrown at red balloons) = 18 pieces

Step 4: Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can divide the remaining pieces by 3 to find the number of yellow balloons:

18 pieces ÷ 3 pieces/balloon = 6 yellow balloons

Step 5: Since we already know that there are 20 red balloons, we can add the number of yellow balloons to get the total number of balloons:

20 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons = 26 balloons

Step 6: Since we're looking for the number of yellow balloons, our answer is:

	+ 4 movies on Saturday
	+ (4/2) = 2 movies on Sunday (since half of 4 is 2)

Step 3: Calculate the total number of movies watched in a weekend.

* On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
* On Sunday, they watch 2 movies.
* Total number of movies watched in a weekend = 4 + 2 = 6 movies

Step 4: Since they watch movies every weekend, we can calculate the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total amount of milk produced by the man's current cows.

The man extracts 5 liters of milk per day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. To find the total amount of milk produced, multiply the number of cows by the amount of milk produced per cow:

3 cows x 5 liters/cow = 15 liters/day

Step 2: Determine the target amount of milk production per day.

The man wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. This is the target amount.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the target amount and the current amount.

To find out how many more cows the man needs to produce 25 liters of milk per day, subtract the current amount from the target amount:

25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day

This means the man needs to produce an additional 10 liters of milk per day to reach his target.

Step 4: Calculate how many more cows are needed to produce the additional milk.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, to produce an additional 10 liters, the man needs:

10 liters/day ÷ 5 liters/cow = 2 additional cows

{The final answer is} the man needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.<|eot_id|>",2.0,2.0,25.0

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Paul starts with 0 marbles, but his friend gives him 28 marbles.

**Step 2:** Paul now has 28 marbles.

**Step 3:** Paul wants a total of 52 marbles. To find out how many more marbles he needs, I'll subtract the number of marbles he already has (28) from his target (52):

52 - 28 = 24

**Step 4:** Paul needs 24 more marbles to reach his target of 52. Since his friend gave him 28 marbles, he already has some. To find out how many more marbles he needs, I'll add the 28 marbles he already has to the 24 marbles he needs:

28 + 24 = 52

**Step 5:** Paul now has a total of 52 marbles (28 + 24). However, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, I'll calculate 1/4 of the total number of marbles he has:

52 × 1/4 = 13

**Step 6:** Paul lost 13 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, I'll subtract the number of marbles he lost (13) from the total number of marbles he had (52):

52 - 13 = 39

**The final answer is:** Paul has 39 marbles left.<|eot_id|>",60.0,60.0,39.0

                    question:
                    a musician has 50 microphones that he wants to arrange in pairs on a stage. while making the arrangement, he realizes that 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. how many pairs of microphones was he able to arrange on the stage?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of microphones available for pairing.
The musician has 50 microphones, but 20% of them won't fit in the arrangement. To find the number of microphones that won't fit, multiply the total number of microphones by 20%:

50 x 0.20 = 10 microphones won't fit

Step 2: Subtract the number of microphones that won't fit from the total number of microphones.
This leaves us with the number of microphones that can be paired:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones can be paired

Step 3: Pair the remaining microphones.
To find the number of pairs that can be formed, divide the number of microphones that can be paired by 2:

40 ÷ 2 = 20 pairs

Step 4: Verify the answer.
We can check our answer by calculating the total number of microphones that would be used if we pair them:

20 pairs x 2 microphones per pair = 40 microphones

This matches the number of microphones that can be paired (40) from Step 2.

{The final answer is 20 pairs of microphones.}<|eot_id|>",20.0,20.0,20.0

                    question:
                    to raise money for their class fund, each of the 30 students from one class sold lollipops that cost $0.8 per lollypop. on average, each student sold 10 lollipop ones, if they bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, how much money was the class able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by each student.

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students in the class. To find the total number of lollipops sold, we multiply the number of students by the number of lollipops each student sold:

30 students × 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling lollipops.

Each lollipop costs $0.8, and 300 lollipops were sold. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of lollipops by the cost of each lollipop:

300 lollipops × $0.8/lollipop = $240

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying lollipops.

The class bought the lollipops for $0.5 each. Since they bought 300 lollipops, the total cost is:

300 lollipops × $0.5/lollipop = $150

Step 4: Calculate the profit made by the class.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

$240 (revenue) - $150 (cost) = $90

Step 5: Determine the answer.

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

                    adrianne is collecting different kinds of beads for making bracelets. her father gave her 20 metallic beads. her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, and her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave.  how many beads did adrianne have altogether?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Adrianne's father gave her 20 metallic beads.
Adrianne has 20 beads initially.

Step 2: Adrianne's sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother.
Let's assume the number of beads her mother gave is x. Then, Adrianne's sister gave her x + 10 beads.

Step 3: Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother.
Adrianne's friend gave her 2x beads.

Step 4: Add up the number of beads Adrianne received from her father, sister, and friend.
Adrianne received 20 beads from her father, x + 10 beads from her sister, and 2x beads from her friend. The total number of beads is:

20 + (x + 10) + 2x

Combine like terms:

20 + x + 10 + 2x
= 20 + (x + 2x) + 10
= 20 + 3x + 10

Step 5: Simplify the expression.
Combine the constants:

30 + 3x

Step 6: Add up the number of beads Adrianne received from her father, sister, and friend.
Adrianne has a total of 30 + 3x beads.

{The final answer is} 30 + 3x beads.

Note: Since we don't know the value of x (the number of beads her mother gave), we can't give a specific numerical answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of cookies brought by the guests.

Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, and there were 100 servants in the reception. So, the total number of cookies brought is:

100 servants x 15 cookies per servant = 1500 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies given to the church next door.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. To find the number of cookies given, multiply the total number of cookies by 1/2:

1500 cookies x 1/2 = 750 cookies

Step 3: Determine the number of cookies each person in the church next door received.

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find the number of people, divide the number of cookies given by 15:

750 cookies ÷ 15 cookies per person = 50 people

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's find the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box.

Since Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and 4 boxes, we can divide 64 by 4 to find the number of chocolate bars in each box:

64 ÷ 4 = 16

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Step 2: Let's find the number of chocolate bars Martha has in each box.

Since Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars and 7 boxes, we can divide 56 by 7 to find the number of chocolate bars in each box:

56 ÷ 7 = 8

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Step 3: To find the difference in the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars Martha has in each box from the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box:

16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of pieces of sweets in the box.
Anne has 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of packs by the number of pieces per pack:

15 packs x 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces

Step 2: Anne kept 2 packs. How many pieces did she keep?
Each pack has 60 pieces, so Anne kept:

2 packs x 60 pieces/pack = 120 pieces

Step 3: How many pieces did Anne give to her friends?
Anne gave away all the pieces except the ones she kept. To find the number of pieces she gave away, we subtract the number of pieces she kept from the total number of pieces:

900 pieces - 120 pieces = 780 pieces

Step 4: How many pieces did Anne give to each of her 10 friends?
To divide the 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends, we divide the total number of pieces by 10:

780 pieces ÷ 10 friends = 78 pieces per friend

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total distance Bernice needs to cover.
The distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is approximately 1955 kilometers.

Step 2: Identify the distance Bernice has already covered.
Bernice walked 325 kilometers for 4 days. To find the average distance she walked per day, we can divide the total distance walked (325 km) by the number of days (4):

325 km ÷ 4 days = 81.25 km/day

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Bernice has covered so far.
Since Bernice walked for 4 days, she has covered a total distance of:

81.25 km/day × 4 days = 325 km

Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance Bernice needs to cover.
To find the remaining distance, subtract the distance Bernice has already covered from the total distance:

They watch 4 movies on Saturday.
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4/2 = 2 movies.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of movies they watch in a weekend.
On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
On Sunday, they watch 2 movies.
Total movies in a weekend = 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

Step 3: Since they watch movies every weekend, we can multiply the total number of movies in a weekend by the number of weekends in 4 weeks.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of guests who entered the restaurant in the morning.
The problem states that 50 guests entered the restaurant in the morning.

Step 2: Identify the number of guests who entered the restaurant at 10:00.
The problem states that 40 more people entered the restaurant at 10:00.

Step 3: Identify the number of guests who entered the restaurant after 10:00.
The problem states that twice the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number would be 2 x 40 = 80.

Step 4: Identify the number of guests who entered the restaurant by evening.
The problem states that an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. The first group of people consisted of 50 guests, so 3 times that number would be 3 x 50 = 150. Add this to the number of guests who entered at 10:00 (80), and you get 150 + 80 = 230.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day.
Add the number of guests who entered in the morning (50) to the number of guests who entered at 10:00 (40) and the number of guests who entered by evening (230), and you get:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: We know that Bernie owns 4 dogs, and we need to find out how many miles the last dog needs.

Step 2: We are given the amount of exercise each dog needs per day:

* Dog 1 needs to walk 1 mile
* Dog 2 needs to walk 4 miles
* Dog 3 needs to walk 3 miles

Step 3: We are also given the average amount of exercise the dogs need per day, which is 3 miles.

Step 4: Since there are 4 dogs, the total amount of exercise they need per day is 4 times the average, which is:

4 x 3 miles = 12 miles

Step 5: We know that the first three dogs need a total of 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles of exercise.

Step 6: To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total exercise needed by the first three dogs from the total exercise needed by all 4 dogs:

12 miles (total exercise needed) - 8 miles (exercise needed by first 3 dogs) = 4 miles

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the cost of each watermelon

The farmer bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the cost of each watermelon, we can divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

$80 ÷ 50 = $1.60 per watermelon

So, each watermelon costs the farmer $1.60.

Step 2: Calculate the selling price of each watermelon

The farmer sold all the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we need to calculate 25% of the cost of each watermelon:

25% of $1.60 = 0.25 x $1.60 = $0.40

Add this profit to the cost of each watermelon to get the selling price:

$1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00

So, each watermelon is sold for $2.00.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of people involved in sharing the pizzas. We know Henry is one person, and he has 3 groups with him. So, there are a total of 1 (Henry) + 3 (groups) = 4 people.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pizzas. Each person (Henry and his 3 groups) averages 7 pizzas for lunch. Since there are 4 people, the total number of pizzas is:

7 pizzas/person × 4 people = 28 pizzas

Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:

28 pizzas × 8 slices/pizza = 224 slices

Step 4: Divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have. Since there are 4 people, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

Step 2: Calculate the excess weight above the maximum load of the elevator (700 kg).

* To find the excess weight, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
720 kg (total weight) - 700 kg (maximum load) = 20 kg

Step 3: Interpret the result.

* The excess weight is 20 kg. This means that Jack and the 8 other adults will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

                    question:
                    ginger and amy both go with 100 pieces of halloween candy. ginger eats 4 pieces a day and amy eats 3 pieces a day. how much more candy does amy have after two weeks?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1:** Both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy.

**Step 2:** We need to calculate how many pieces of candy each of them has eaten after two weeks.

**Step 3:** Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day. To find out how many pieces she eats in two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks.

A week has 7 days, so two weeks have 14 days. Ginger eats:

4 pieces/day × 14 days = 56 pieces

**Step 4:** Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day. To find out how many pieces she eats in two weeks, we again calculate the total number of days:

3 pieces/day × 14 days = 42 pieces

**Step 5:** Now we subtract the number of pieces each of them has eaten from their initial 100 pieces:

Ginger: 100 - 56 = 44 pieces
Amy: 100 - 42 = 58 pieces

**Step 6:** We need to find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks. To do this, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy:

Amy's remaining candy - Ginger's remaining candy = 58 - 44 = 14 pieces

**The final answer is:** Amy has 14 pieces more candy than Ginger after two weeks.<|eot_id|>",14.0,14.0,14.0

                    question:
                    alice includes 6 more children than steven. clara has two times as many books as steven. if clara has 20 books, how many more books does clara have than alice?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Clara has 20 books, and she has two times as many books as Steven. This means that Steven has:

20 ÷ 2 = 10 books

Step 2: Alice has 6 more children than Steven. This means that Alice has:

10 + 6 = 16 children

Step 3: Since Clara has twice as many books as Steven, and Steven has 10 books, Clara has:

10 × 2 = 20 books

Step 4: Since Alice has 16 children, and Clara has 20 books, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. To do this, we'll subtract the number of books Alice has from Clara's number of books.

20 (Clara's books) -? (Alice's books)

Step 5: Since we don't know how many books Alice has, we'll need to find it. Since Clara has twice as many books as Steven, and Steven has 10 books, Alice must have half as many books as Clara:

20 ÷ 2 = 10 books

Step 6: Now that we know Alice has 10 books, we can subtract it from Clara's 20 books to find out how many more books Clara has:

20 - 10 = 10 books

{The final answer is} Clara has 10 more books than Alice.<|eot_id|>",4.0,4.0,10.0

                    question:
                    two cars are driving on a highway.  the first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour when the second car leaves it at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.  if both cars continue on the highway at the same speed, how many miles will separate them after 2 hours?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial distance between the two cars.
Since the first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, and the second car leaves it at an average speed of 70 miles per hour, we can assume that the second car starts from the same position as the first car. Therefore, the initial distance between the two cars is 0 miles.

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by each car in the first hour.
The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, so it covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 1 hour = 60 miles

The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour, so it covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 1 hour = 70 miles

Step 3: Calculate the distance between the two cars after the first hour.
Since the first car covers 60 miles in the first hour, and the second car covers 70 miles, the distance between them after the first hour is:

Distance = Distance traveled by first car - Distance traveled by second car = 70 miles - 60 miles = 10 miles

Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled by each car in the second hour.
The first car continues to travel at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, so it covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 1 hour = 60 miles

The second car also continues to travel at an average speed of 70 miles per hour, so it covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 1 hour = 70 miles

Step 5: Calculate the distance between the two cars after 2 hours.
The first car has now covered a total distance of 60 miles + 60 miles = 120 miles. The second car has now covered a total distance of 70 miles + 70 miles = 140 miles. Therefore, the distance between them after 2 hours is:

Distance = Distance traveled by first car - Distance traveled by second car = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.

Step 2: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, which means Saskay can lift a mountain:

12 x 1 inch = 12 inches

Step 3: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, which means Kagiyami can lift a mountain:

4 x 12 inches = 48 inches

Step 4: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, which means Naruto can lift a mountain:

10 x 48 inches = 480 inches

Step 5: Convert the answer from inches to feet:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves.

Initially, there are 60 elves.

Step 2: A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them.

A third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. So, 20 elves quit.

Remaining elves = 60 - 20 = 40

Step 3: Then, 10 of the surviving elves quit after kids kick their shins.

The 10 elves who quit are a part of the 40 remaining elves. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining 40.

Remaining elves = 40 - 10 = 30

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones.

Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 gemstones per necklace, the total length of the gemstones is:

8 gemstones × 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total length of the necklace minus the length of the topaz gemstones.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and we've calculated the length of the topaz gemstones to be 8 inches. So, we subtract the length of the gemstones from the total length:

25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches

Step 3: Calculate the remaining length of the necklace that needs to be filled with sterling silver beads.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the remaining length (17 inches) by 1/4 inch to find the number of beads needed:

17 inches ÷ (1/4 inch/bead) = 68 beads

Step 4: Since we're looking for the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we don't need to consider the topaz gemstones. Therefore, the answer is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of plant pots needed for the daisies.
April is asked to buy 30 plant pots for the daisies.

Step 2: Determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses.
April is asked to buy twice as many plant pots for the roses as she is for the daisies. Since she needs 30 plant pots for the daisies, she needs 2 x 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of plant pots needed.
April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and 60 plant pots for the roses, for a total of:
30 + 60 = 90 plant pots

Step 4: Calculate the number of plant pots April has left over.
April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center before she knew how many she needed. Since she needs a total of 90 plant pots, she will have:
100 - 90 = 10 plant pots left over

Each year, Ted collects 6 lemons from each tree.

Step 3: Determine how many lemons Ted collects from each tree in a decade (10 years).
Since Ted collects 6 lemons from each tree in a year, and there are 10 years in a decade, he will collect:

6 lemons/year × 10 years = 60 lemons

Step 4: Determine how many lemons Ted collects from all 5 trees in a decade.
Since Ted has 5 trees, and each tree yields 60 lemons in a decade, he will collect:

Adam already had some money, but we don't know how much. Let's call the amount of money Adam had initially ""x"".

Step 2: Adam's daddy gave him twice as much as his mother.

Adam's mother gave him $6, so Adam's daddy gave him:

$6 x 2 = $12

So, Adam's daddy gave him $12.

Step 3: Adam bought the trousers for $30.

Adam received $6 from his mother and $12 from his daddy, for a total of:

$6 + $12 = $18

He still needs to pay $30 for the trousers, so he needs to contribute:

$30 - $18 = $12

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: We know that it took James 10 minutes to read 3 pages of his book.

Step 2: We can find the time it takes James to read 1 page by dividing the time it took him to read 3 pages by 3.

Time to read 1 page = Time to read 3 pages ÷ 3
= 10 minutes ÷ 3
= 3.33 minutes (approximately)

Step 3: We know that James reads 18 pages of his book. We can find the total time it takes him to read all 18 pages by multiplying the time it takes him to read 1 page by 18.

Time to read 18 pages = Time to read 1 page × 18
= 3.33 minutes × 18

**Step 2:** Calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family:

* Finn: 5 sandwiches
* Wife: 4 sandwiches
* Son: 2 sandwiches
* Total: 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches per day

**Step 3:** Since we want to find the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week, we need to multiply the daily total by 7 (the number of days in a week):

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of apples ordered.
The school ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples, so the total number of apples ordered is:
42 (red apples) + 7 (green apples) = 49 apples

Step 2: Determine the number of apples needed for the students' lunches.
Only 9 students wanted fruit, so we need to find out how many apples are needed for them. Let's assume each student gets one apple (we'll get to the extra apples later).

For the 9 students, we need:
9 students × 1 apple/student = 9 apples

Step 3: Calculate the extra apples.
The cafeteria ordered a total of 49 apples, but only 9 apples are needed for the students' lunches. To find the extra apples, we subtract the number of apples needed from the total number of apples ordered:
49 apples (ordered) - 9 apples (needed) = 40 apples

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Wendy started with an unknown number of pastries (cupcakes and cookies).
* She ate 4 cupcakes and 29 cookies.
* After the sale, she had 24 pastries left to take back home.

Step 2: Determine the total number of pastries Wendy had initially.

* Since she ate 4 cupcakes and 29 cookies, we need to add these numbers together to find the total number of pastries she had initially.
* 4 cupcakes + 29 cookies = 33 pastries

Step 3: Subtract the number of pastries she ate from the total number of pastries she had initially to find the number of pastries she had left after eating.

* 33 pastries (initially) - 4 cupcakes - 29 cookies = 0 pastries (after eating)

Step 4: Add the number of pastries she had left after eating (0) to the number of pastries she had left after the sale (24) to find the total number of pastries she had after the sale.

* 0 pastries (after eating) + 24 pastries (after the sale) = 24 pastries

Step 5: Since Wendy had 24 pastries after the sale, we subtract this number from the total number of pastries she had initially (33) to find the number of pastries she sold.

* 33 pastries (initially) - 24 pastries (after the sale) = 9 pastries sold

46 (initial math problems) - 40 (math problems finished at school) = 6

Step 4: Faye also had 9 science questions for homework. Since she finished all of her math problems, she still has to do all of her science questions.
Faye has 9 science questions to do for homework.

Step 5: Combine the number of math problems Faye has left to do with the number of science questions she has to do.
6 (math problems left to do) + 9 (science questions) = 15

                    question:
                    at the exposition - tom won 32 passes playing 'whack a mole' and 25 tickets playing'skee ball'. if he spent 7 of his tickets on a hat, how many tickets does tom have left?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Tom won a total of 25 tickets playing'skee ball'. He then spent 7 of these tickets on a hat. To find out how many tickets Tom has left, we need to subtract the number of tickets he spent from the total number of tickets he won.

Step 2: Tom won 25 tickets playing'skee ball'. He spent 7 of these tickets, so we subtract 7 from 25 to find the number of tickets he has left:

25 - 7 = 18

Step 3: Tom also won 32 passes playing 'whack a mole', but this is irrelevant to the problem at hand, which is about the tickets he won playing'skee ball'.

Step 4: Since Tom has 18 tickets left after spending 7, we can conclude that this is the number of tickets he has left.

{The final answer is 18 tickets}.<|eot_id|>",50.0,50.0,18.0

                    zoe has two corresponding books. one having 44 pictures and the other had 44. after one week she had already colored 20 of the pictures. how many pictures does she still have to color?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of pictures Zoe has to color.
Since Zoe has two books with 44 pictures each, the total number of pictures she has to color is:

44 (pictures in book 1) + 44 (pictures in book 2) = 88 pictures

Step 2: Identify the number of pictures Zoe has already colored.
According to the problem, Zoe has already colored 20 pictures.

Step 3: Subtract the number of pictures Zoe has already colored from the total number of pictures.
To find the number of pictures Zoe still has to color, we subtract the number of pictures she has already colored from the total number of pictures:

88 (total pictures) - 20 (pictures already colored) = 68 pictures

Step 4: Check our answer.
We can see that the answer makes sense: Zoe has 68 pictures left to color.

{The final answer is 68 pictures}.<|eot_id|>",68.0,68.0,68.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of cats
The habitat grocery found 12 Siamese cats and 20 house cats. To find the total number of cats, we add these two numbers together:

12 (Siamese cats) + 20 (house cats) = 32 cats

So, initially, the habitat grocery has 32 cats.

Step 2: Determine the number of cats sold
During the sale, they sold 20 cats.

Step 3: Subtract the number of cats sold from the initial total
To find the number of cats left, we subtract the number of cats sold from the initial total:

32 (initial cats) - 20 (cats sold) =?

Step 4: Perform the subtraction
32 - 20 = 12

So, after selling 20 cats, the habitat grocery has:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of apples ordered
The cafeteria ordered 43 red apples and 32 green apples, so the total number of apples ordered is:
43 (red apples) + 32 (green apples) = 75 apples

Step 2: Determine the number of apples needed for 2 students
Since only 2 students wanted fruit, we need to determine how many apples are needed for those 2 students. Let's assume each student wants 1 apple (this could be either a red or green apple).

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples needed for 2 students
Since each student wants 1 apple, the total number of apples needed for 2 students is:
2 students x 1 apple/student = 2 apples

Step 4: Calculate the excess apples
The cafeteria ordered a total of 75 apples, but only 2 apples are needed for the 2 students who wanted fruit. To find the excess apples, subtract the number of apples needed from the total number of apples ordered:
75 apples (ordered) - 2 apples (needed) = 73 apples

Step 5: Determine the extra apples
Since the cafeteria ordered 75 apples and only 2 apples are needed, the extra apples are:
73 apples (excess) - 2 apples (needed) = 71 apples

{The final answer is 71 extra apples.}<|eot_id|>",73.0,73.0,71.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Haley and her pa collected a total of 39 + 38 = 77 carrots.

Step 2: We know that only 64 of the carrots were good. This means that the remaining carrots are bad.

Step 3: To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots: 77 - 64 =?

Step 4: Performing the subtraction, we get: 77 - 64 = 13

Step 5: Therefore, there are 13 bad carrots.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Roger initially had $29.

Step 2: He gave an additional $20, so we need to add this to his initial amount:

$29 + $20 = $49

Step 3: He spent $34 on a new game, so we need to subtract this from his total amount:

$49 - $34 =?

To calculate this, we can subtract $34 from $49:

$49 = $50 (since we're subtracting a smaller amount from a larger one)

$50 - $34 = $16

Step 4: Therefore, Roger has $16 left after giving away $20 and spending $34.

Emily scored 16 points in the first round and 33 points in the second round. To find her total points before the last round, I'll add these two scores together:

16 + 33 = 49

So, Emily had 49 points before the last round.

Step 2: Identify the points Emily lost in the last round.
Emily lost 48 points in the last round.

Step 3: Subtract the points Emily lost from her total points.
To find her final points, I'll subtract the points she lost from her total points:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of apples ordered.
The municipal diet ordered 33 red apples and 23 green apples, so the total number of apples ordered is:
33 (red apples) + 23 (green apples) = 56 apples

Step 2: Determine the number of apples needed for the 21 students who wanted fruit.
Since each student gets one piece of fruit, the cafeteria needs:
21 students × 1 apple/student = 21 apples

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total number of apples ordered and the number of apples needed.
To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, subtract the number of apples needed from the total number of apples ordered:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of cats
The national center had Siamese cats and house cats initially. Let's assume the initial number of cats is unknown for now.

Step 2: Determine the number of cats lost
The national center lost 41 Siamese cats and 28 house cats. To find the total number of cats lost, we add these numbers together:
41 Siamese cats + 28 house cats = 69 cats

Step 3: Update the initial number of cats
Since the national center lost 69 cats, we subtract this number from the initial number of cats (which we don't know yet). Let's call the initial number of cats ""x"". Then, the updated number of cats is:
x - 69

Step 4: Determine the number of cats sold
During the sale, the national center sold 15 cats.

Step 5: Update the updated number of cats (from Step 3)
Since 15 cats were sold, we subtract this number from the updated number of cats (x - 69). This gives us:
(x - 69) - 15

Step 6: Simplify the expression
To simplify the expression, we can combine the constants:
x - 84

Step 7: Find the final number of cats

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Oliver initially has $35.

**Step 2:** He wants to add $50 more, so he needs a total of $35 + $50 = $85.

**Step 3:** However, he spends $84 on a new game. To find out how much he has left, we need to subtract $84 from the total amount he needed ($85).

$85 (total needed) - $84 (spent) = $1

**Step 4:** So, Oliver has $1 less than the amount he needed. To find out how much he has now, we subtract the $1 from the initial amount he had ($35).

$35 (initial amount) - $1 (less than needed) = $34

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of music files Vanessa had.
Vanessa had 13 music files initially.

Step 2: Identify the initial number of video files Vanessa had.
Vanessa had 30 video files initially.

Step 3: Vanessa deleted 10 music files. To find the number of music files left, subtract the number of files deleted from the initial number of music files.
13 (initial music files) - 10 (files deleted) = 3 music files left

Step 4: The number of video files remains the same, as Vanessa only deleted music files. Therefore, the number of video files left is still 30.

Step 5: Combine the number of music files left (3) with the number of video files left (30) to find the total number of files left on Vanessa's flash drive.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of apples ordered.
The cafeteria ordered 8 red apples and 43 green apples, so the total number of apples is:
8 (red apples) + 43 (green apples) = 51 apples

Step 2: Identify the number of students who wanted fruit.
42 students wanted fruit.

Step 3: Identify the number of apple choices available to each student.
Since each student can choose one apple, the number of apple choices available to each student is:
1 (apple choice per student)

Step 4: Calculate the total number of apple choices available.
Since there are 42 students who wanted fruit, the total number of apple choices available is:
42 (students) x 1 (apple choice per student) = 42 apple choices

Step 5: Compare the total number of apples ordered to the total number of apple choices available.
The cafeteria ordered 51 apples, but only 42 students wanted fruit. This means that there are:
51 (apples ordered) - 42 (apple choices available) = 9 apples left over.

Step 6: Determine the number of choices left over.
Since there are 9 apples left over, the cafeteria has:
9 (apples left over) x 1 (apple choice per apple) = 9 choices left over.

"the school cafeteria included 6 red apples and 15 green apples for students lunches. but, if only 5 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    the school cafeteria included 6 red apples and 15 green apples for students lunches. but, if only 5 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of apples available in the cafeteria.
The cafeteria has 6 red apples and 15 green apples, for a total of:
6 (red apples) + 15 (green apples) = 21 apples

Step 2: Determine how many apples the cafeteria will need to distribute if 5 students want fruit.
If 5 students want fruit, the cafeteria will need to distribute at least 5 apples (assuming each student gets 1 apple).

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples the cafeteria will have left over after distributing 5 apples.
The cafeteria has 21 apples initially. After distributing 5 apples, the remaining apples are:
21 (initial apples) - 5 (apples distributed) = 16 apples

Step 4: Calculate the number of extra apples the cafeteria has left over.
The cafeteria has 16 apples left over after distributing 5 apples. Since there were originally 21 apples, the cafeteria has:
16 (remaining apples) - 21 (initial apples) = -5 apples extra

Wait, what? The cafeteria actually has fewer apples than it started with! This is because the cafeteria distributed more apples than it had initially. To find the number of extra apples the cafeteria has left over, we need to find the difference between the number of apples it had and the number of apples it distributed.

Step 5: Calculate the number of extra apples the cafeteria has left over.
The cafeteria had 21 apples initially and distributed 5 apples. To find the number of extra apples, we subtract the number of apples distributed from the initial number of apples:
21 (initial apples) - 5 (apples distributed) = 16 apples

The cafeteria has 16 apples left over, which means it has:
16 (remaining apples) - 5 (apples distributed) = 11 apples extra

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Katie gained 10 pieces of candy, which means she initially had less candy than her sister. Let's assume Katie's sister had x pieces of candy initially.

Step 2: Katie's sister had 6 pieces of candy after the switch, which means Katie's sister gave her 6 pieces of candy. Since Katie gained 10 pieces of candy, she must have had 6 pieces of candy initially.

Step 3: Since Katie gained 10 pieces of candy, she must have had 6 pieces of candy initially. This means her sister had 6 + 10 = 16 pieces of candy initially.

Step 4: After the switch, Katie's sister had 6 pieces of candy, and Katie had 6 + 10 = 16 pieces of candy.

Step 5: They ate 9 pieces of candy the first night, which means they consumed a total of 9 pieces.

Step 6: Since Katie had 16 pieces of candy, and they ate 9 pieces, Katie has 16 - 9 = 7 pieces of candy left.

Step 7: Katie's sister had 6 pieces of candy, and they ate 9 pieces, so Katie's sister has 6 - 3 = 3 pieces of candy left.

Step 8: Since Katie's sister had 3 pieces of candy left, and they have a total of 7 pieces of candy left (Katie's 7 + Katie's sister's 3), they have a total of 7 + 3 = 10 pieces of candy left.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Identify the initial number of files on Haley's flash drive.
Haley had 27 music files and 42 video pieces, which means she had a total of:

27 (music files) + 42 (video pieces) = 69 files

**Step 2:** Identify the number of files to be deleted.
Haley wants to delete 11 files.

**Step 3:** Subtract the number of files to be deleted from the initial total.
To find the number of files remaining, subtract 11 from the initial total:

69 (initial files) - 11 (files to be deleted) = 58 files

**The final answer is:** 58 files

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of customers the Filipino waiter had to wait on.
The problem states that the Filipino had 39 customers to wait on.

Step 2: Identify the additional number of customers added during the lunch rush.
The problem states that 12 more customers were added during the lunch rush.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of customers the Filipino waiter had to wait on.
To find the total number of customers, we add the initial 39 customers to the additional 12 customers:
39 + 12 = 51

Step 4: Identify the number of customers who didn't leave a tip.
The problem states that 49 customers didn't leave a tip.

Step 5: Calculate the number of customers who left a tip.
To find the number of customers who left a tip, we subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of customers the butler needs to wait on.
The problem states that the butler has to wait on 26 customers initially.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of customers the butler has to wait on after the lunch rush.
The problem states that 27 additional patrons arrive during the lunch rush. To find the total number of customers, we add the initial 26 customers to the 27 new customers:
26 (initial customers) + 27 (new customers) = 53 customers

Step 3: Identify the number of customers who didn't leave a tip.
The problem states that 27 customers didn't leave a tip. This means that the number of customers who didn't leave a tip is equal to the number of new customers who arrived during the lunch rush.

Step 4: Calculate the number of customers who left a tip.
Since the butler has to wait on a total of 53 customers, and 27 of them didn't leave a tip, we can subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers to find the number of customers who left a tip:
53 (total customers) - 27 (customers who didn't leave a tip) = 26 customers

Step 5: Identify the number of customers who left a tip.
The answer is 26 customers. These customers left a tip for the butler.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Wendy fashioned conries (this is a street deke conference, but it's not relevant to the problem)
* She cracked 41 cups cakes.
* She cracked 31 cookies.
* After the sale, she had 32 pastries to take back home.

Step 2: Determine what we are looking for. We want to find out how many pastries Wendy sold.

Step 3: Use the information given to set up an equation. Let's say the number of pastries Wendy sold is x. We know that she had 41 cupcakes and 31 cookies, and after the sale, she had 32 pastries left. This means that the total number of pastries she sold is the sum of the number of cupcakes and cookies, minus the number of pastries she had left.

x = 41 (cupcakes) + 31 (cookies) - 32 (pastries left)

Step 4: Simplify the equation.

x = 41 + 31 - 32

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    the school cafeteria had 25 red apples and 17 green apples for students lunches. but, if only 10 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of apples available in the cafeteria.
We know there are 25 red apples and 17 green apples, so the total number of apples is:
25 (red apples) + 17 (green apples) = 42 apples

Step 2: Determine how many apples the cafeteria would need to provide for the 10 students who want fruit.
Since each student wants fruit, we need to calculate the total number of apples required for these students. Let's assume each student wants one apple (we don't know if they want a specific type of apple, so we'll use a general assumption).

For 10 students, the total number of apples required is:
10 students x 1 apple/student = 10 apples

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples the cafeteria would provide for the 10 students.
The cafeteria would provide 10 apples to the students, which means they would take 10 apples from the initial stock.

Step 4: Calculate the number of apples left over after providing for the 10 students.
We subtract the number of apples provided (10) from the initial number of apples (42):
42 apples - 10 apples = 32 apples

Step 5: Determine the number of extra apples the cafeteria has left over.
Since the cafeteria started with 42 apples and provided 10 apples to the students, they have 32 apples left over. To find the number of extra apples, we subtract the initial number of apples from the number of apples left over:
32 apples (left over) - 42 apples (initial) = -10 apples

Wait, what? We got a negative number! This means the cafeteria didn't have enough apples to begin with. But that's not the question we're trying to answer. Instead, we need to find the number of extra apples the cafeteria has left over.

Step 6: Convert the negative number to a positive number to find the number of extra apples.
Since the cafeteria has 32 apples left over, we can convert the negative number to a positive number by taking the absolute value:
| -10 apples | = 10 apples

{The final answer is} 10 apples.

The cafeteria has 10 extra apples left over after providing for the 10 students.<|eot_id|>",32.0,32.0,10.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Cody received 45 dollars initially.

Step 2: He received 9 more dollars as a birthday gift, so his total amount of money now is:

45 (initial amount) + 9 (birthday gift) = 54 dollars

Step 3: Cody spent 19 dollars on a new game.

Step 4: To find out how much money Cody has now, we need to subtract the amount he spent (19 dollars) from the total amount he had after receiving the birthday gift (54 dollars):

54 (total amount) - 19 (amount spent) = 35 dollars

{The final answer is} Cody has 35 dollars now.<|eot_id|>",35.0,35.0,35.0

Step 2: She sells 9 cupcakes. To find out how many cupcakes she has left, we subtract 9 from 30:

30 - 9 = 21

So, Carol has 21 cupcakes left.

Step 3: Carol makes 28 more cupcakes. To find out how many cupcakes she now has, we add 28 to the number of cupcakes she had left (21):

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Initially, a has 47 customers to wait on.

Step 2: 41 customers leave. To find the number of customers remaining, subtract 41 from 47:

47 - 41 = 6

So, after 41 customers leave, a has 6 customers remaining.

Step 3: A gets another 20 customers. To find the new total, add the remaining 6 customers to the new 20 customers:

6 + 20 = 26

So, a now has a total of 26 customers.

Step 2: She graded 25 worksheets, which means she has now graded 25 worksheets.

Step 3: The teacher's goal is to grade all the worksheets, which means she needs to grade the remaining worksheets.

Step 4: Since she graded 25 worksheets, she has already graded some of the worksheets. To find out how many worksheets she still needs to grade, we need to subtract the number of worksheets she graded from the initial number of worksheets.

29 (initial number of worksheets) - 25 (number of worksheets graded) = 4

Step 5: So, the teacher still has 4 worksheets left to grade.

Step 6: Then, 29 more worksheets are turned in. This means the teacher now has a total of:

                    question:
                    the senior bakery prepared 42 different apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. but, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of apples prepared by the senior bakery.

The senior bakery prepared 42 different apples and 7 green apples. To find the total number of apples, we add these two numbers together:

42 (different apples) + 7 (green apples) = 49 apples

Step 2: Determine the number of students who wanted fruit.

According to the problem, only 9 students wanted fruit.

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples needed for the students.

Since there are 9 students who wanted fruit, and each student wants some fruit, we need to find out how many apples are needed to satisfy their demand. Let's assume each student wants one apple (this could be a different type of fruit, but for simplicity, let's assume they all want apples). Therefore, we need:

9 students × 1 apple/student = 9 apples

Step 4: Calculate the number of extra apples the cafeteria has.

The cafeteria prepared 49 apples (Step 1), but only 9 apples were needed for the students (Step 3). To find the number of extra apples, we subtract the number of apples needed from the total number of apples prepared:

49 apples (prepared) - 9 apples (needed) = 40 apples

The cafeteria has 40 extra apples.

I'll break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1:** Carol and her neighbor were breaking cock, from their yard! (Note: This sentence is a bit unclear, but I assume it means they were picking carrots from their yard.)

**Step 2:** Carol, 29, and her mother picked 16 carrots.

**Step 3:** The problem states that only 38 of the carrots were good. This means that the remaining carrots are bad.

**Step 4:** Since Carol and her mother picked 16 carrots, and only 38 carrots were good, we can subtract 38 from the total number of carrots they picked to find the number of bad carrots.

**Step 5:** Let's subtract 38 from 16:

16 - 38 = -22 (wait, this doesn't make sense!)

**Step 6:** Ah, I see what's going on here. The problem is asking us to find the number of bad carrots, but the subtraction doesn't work because we're subtracting a larger number from a smaller number. Instead, we need to subtract the smaller number from the larger number.

**Step 7:** So, let's subtract 16 from 38:

38 - 16 = 22

**The final answer is:** There are 22 bad carrots.<|eot_id|>",7.0,7.0,22.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Oliver has 39 longer button blue and 47 club ranking trousers. He wants to know how many he didn't wash before school started.

Step 2: Identify the given information
Oliver washed 20 of his trousers by the time school started.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of trousers Oliver has
Oliver has 39 longer button blue trousers and 47 club ranking trousers. To find the total number of trousers, we add these two numbers together:

39 + 47 = 86

Step 4: Subtract the number of washed trousers from the total number of trousers
Oliver washed 20 trousers. To find out how many he didn't wash, we subtract 20 from the total number of trousers:

86 - 20 = 66

Step 5: The final answer is
Oliver didn't wash 66 trousers before school started. {The final answer is 66}.<|eot_id|>",66.0,66.0,66.0

                    question:
                    bianca and her daughters were breaking cockes from their yard! bianca, 26 and her mother picked 15. if only 16 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they make?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that Bianca and her daughters were breaking cockes (I assume this is a typo and it should be ""cocks"" or ""roosters"", but I'll stick to the original text) from their yard. They picked 15 of them, and only 16 were good. This means that the remaining ones are bad.

Step 2: Identify the key information
We know that Bianca and her mother picked 15 cockes, and only 16 were good. This implies that there are more than 15 cockes in total, because 15 cockes would mean that all of them are good, which is not the case.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cockes
Let's assume that the total number of cockes is x. Since only 16 are good, the remaining cockes are bad. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x - 16 = number of bad cockes

Step 4: Use the information given to find the total number of cockes
We know that Bianca and her mother picked 15 cockes. This means that the total number of cockes must be greater than 15, because they picked 15 and only 16 are good. Let's assume that the total number of cockes is x. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x = total number of cockes
15 = number of cockes picked
x - 15 = number of cockes left

Since only 16 are good, the number of cockes left must be equal to the number of bad cockes. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x - 15 = number of bad cockes

Step 5: Combine the equations
We can combine the equations from Step 3 and Step 4 to get:

x - 16 = number of bad cockes
x - 15 = number of cockes left

Subtracting the two equations, we get:

1 = number of good cockes - number of bad cockes
1 = 16 - number of bad cockes

Step 6: Solve for the number of bad cockes
Rearranging the equation, we get:

number of bad cockes = 16 - 1
number of bad cockes = 15

So, there are 15 bad cockes.

{The final answer is 15}.<|eot_id|>",25.0,25.0,15.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Katie baked 7 cupcakes and 5 cookies.
* After the sale, she had 8 pastries to take back home.

Step 2: Identify the unknown quantity we want to find. In this case, we want to find the number of pastries Katie sold.

Step 3: Use the information given to set up an equation. Let's start by using the fact that Katie had 8 pastries to take back home. This means that she must have had more than 8 pastries initially.

* Initial number of pastries = 7 cupcakes + 5 cookies
* Initial number of pastries = 7 + 5 = 12

Step 4: Since Katie had 8 pastries to take back home, we can subtract this from the initial number of pastries to find the number of pastries she sold.

* Number of pastries sold = Initial number of pastries - Number of pastries to take back home
* Number of pastries sold = 12 - 8
* Number of pastries sold = 4

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of gray vegetables and green apples collected.
43 gray vegetables + 32 green apples = 75 total vegetables and apples.

Step 2: Determine the number of students who wanted fruit.
Only 2 students wanted fruit.

Step 3: Since only 2 students wanted fruit, the cafeteria did not distribute any green apples to students. Therefore, the total number of green apples remains the same, which is 32.

Step 4: Since the cafeteria did not distribute any green apples, the extra green apples left over are the total number of green apples collected minus the number of green apples distributed to students.
32 green apples (collected) - 0 green apples (distributed) = 32 green apples left over.

Step 5: The question asks for the number of extra green apples left over. Since the cafeteria collected 32 green apples and distributed 0, the answer is simply the total number of green apples left over.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Haley and her pa collected a total of 39 carrots. Her ma left 38 carrots. To find the total number of carrots collected, we add the number of carrots collected by Haley and her pa to the number of carrots left by her ma.

Total carrots collected = 39 (Haley and her pa) + 38 (her ma) = 77 carrots

Step 2: The problem states that only 64 of the carrots were bad. This means that the remaining carrots are good. To find the number of good carrots, we subtract the number of bad carrots from the total number of carrots collected.

Number of good carrots = Total carrots collected - Number of bad carrots
= 77 carrots - 64 carrots
= 13 good carrots

Step 3: Since only 64 carrots were bad, the remaining carrots are good. To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots collected.

Number of bad carrots = Total carrots collected - Number of good carrots
= 77 carrots - 13 good carrots
= 64 bad carrots

Step 4: The problem asks how many bad carrots they had. The answer is the number of bad carrots found in Step 3.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Paige showed 43 weather experiments, which are not relevant to the problem. We can ignore this part.

Step 2: Paige had 12 science problems to do for homework.

Step 3: She finished 44 problems at school. This means she didn't finish all of them at school, and some remain to be done.

Step 4: To find out how many problems Paige has left to do for homework, we need to subtract the number of problems she finished at school from the original number of problems she had.

Step 5: Paige had 12 science problems initially, and she finished 44 problems at school. To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract 44 from 12:

12 - 44 = -32 (This is not possible, as you can't have a negative number of problems. It means she actually finished more problems than she had initially.)

Step 6: However, since Paige had 12 problems initially, she can't have finished more than 12. This means she must have finished some of the original problems, but not all 44.

Step 7: To find the correct answer, we need to subtract the number of problems she finished at school (44) from the number of problems she had initially (12):

12 - 44 = -32 (This is still not possible, as you can't have a negative number of problems.)

Step 8: Since Paige can't have finished more than 12 problems, we need to re-examine the problem. Let's consider the possibility that she finished some of the original 12 problems, but not all 44. This means she must have finished some of the original 12 problems at school, and some remain to be done.

Step 9: To find the correct answer, we need to subtract the number of problems she finished at school (44) from the original number of problems she had (12). However, this time, we need to consider the fact that she finished some of the original 12 problems at school.

Step 10: Let's assume she finished x problems at school, where x is a number between 0 and 12. The number of problems she has left to do for homework would be:

12 - x

Step 11: We know she finished 44 problems at school, but this doesn't mean she finished all 12 problems. It means she finished some of the original 12 problems, and some remain to be done. To find the correct answer, we need to subtract the number of problems she finished at school (44) from the original number of problems she had (12), considering the fact that she finished some of the original 12 problems at school.

Step 12: The correct answer would be:

12 - (44 - x)

This is because we need to subtract the number of problems she finished at school (44) from the original number of problems she had (12), considering the fact that she finished some of the original 12 problems at school.

However, since we don't know the value of x, we can't provide a specific answer. The problem is incomplete, and we need more information to find the correct answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of flowers and apples prepared by the municipal school.

* Flowers: 33
* Apples: 23

Total items prepared = 33 (flowers) + 23 (apples) = 56

Step 2: Identify the number of students who wanted fruit.

* 21 students wanted fruit

Step 3: Since only 21 students wanted fruit, the cafeteria will not use all 23 apples. Let's calculate how many apples will be used.

* 21 students wanted fruit, so 21 apples will be used

Step 4: Since 21 apples will be used, the cafeteria will have some apples left over. Let's calculate how many apples will be left over.

* Total apples prepared: 23
* Apples used: 21
* Apples left over: 23 - 21 = 2

Step 5: Now, let's calculate how many extra items the cafeteria will have. We need to subtract the apples used (21) from the total items prepared (56).

* Extra items = Total items prepared - Apples used
= 56 - 21
= 35

However, we need to consider that 35 is the total number of extra items, which includes both flowers and apples. Since we want to find the extra flowers, we need to subtract the apples used (21) from the total flowers prepared (33).

* Extra flowers = Flowers prepared - Apples used
= 33 - 0 (since no apples were used for flowers)
= 33

However, this is not the correct answer, as we need to consider the apples left over (2) that are not being used. To find the extra flowers, we need to subtract the apples used (21) from the total flowers prepared (33), and then add the apples left over (2).

* Extra flowers = Flowers prepared - (Apples used - Apples left over)
= 33 - (21 - 2)
= 33 - 19
= 14

Therefore, the cafeteria will have 14 extra flowers.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that Vanessa and her gram (grandmother) picked carrots from their yard. They picked a total of 14 carrots, but only 24 carrots were good. We need to find out how many bad carrots they have.

Step 2: Identify the given information
We know that Vanessa and her gram picked 14 carrots, and only 24 carrots were good. This means that the total number of carrots is 24 (since 24 are good).

Step 3: Determine the number of bad carrots
Since only 24 carrots are good, the remaining carrots must be bad. To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots:

24 (good carrots) - 14 (picked carrots) = 10

Step 4: Check the answer
We have found that there are 10 bad carrots. This makes sense, since 14 carrots were picked, and only 24 carrots were good. The remaining carrots must be the 10 bad carrots.

Step 2: Edward spent $2 in the spring tending lawns. To find his new balance, we subtract $2 from $0:

$0 - $2 = -$2

So, Edward's balance is now -$2.

Step 3: In the summer, Edward made $27. To find his new balance, we add $27 to -$2:

-$2 + $27 = $25

So, Edward's balance is now $25.

Step 4: Edward had to spend $5 buying supplies. To find his new balance, we subtract $5 from $25:

$25 - $5 = $20

Kaleb spent $4 tending lawns, which means he didn't earn any money in the spring. His balance remains at $0.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Kaleb earned in the summer.
Kaleb made $50 in the summer.

Step 4: Update Kaleb's balance.
Kaleb's balance now becomes $50, since he earned $50 in the summer.

Step 5: Calculate the amount of money Kaleb spends on supplies.
Kaleb spends $4 buying supplies.

                    question:
                    the local website said 6 red apples and 15 green apples for students lunches. but, if only 5 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial quantity of apples.
The website says there are 6 red apples and 15 green apples for students' lunches. To find the total initial quantity, we add these two numbers together:

6 (red apples) + 15 (green apples) = 21 apples

Step 2: Determine the number of students who want fruit.
The problem states that only 5 students want fruit. This means that 5 students will take some apples.

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples taken by the 5 students.
Since each student wants some fruit, let's assume each student takes 1 apple (this could be either red or green). To find the total number of apples taken, we multiply the number of students by the number of apples each student takes:

5 students × 1 apple/student = 5 apples

Step 4: Find the remaining apples.
We subtract the number of apples taken by the students from the initial total:

21 apples (initial) - 5 apples (taken) = 16 apples

Step 5: Determine the number of extra apples the cafeteria has.
Since the cafeteria had 21 apples initially, and 5 apples were taken, the remaining apples are 16. To find the number of extra apples, we subtract the number of apples taken from the initial total:

21 apples (initial) - 16 apples (remaining) = 5 apples

The cafeteria ended up with 5 extra apples.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of items brought by the senior se:
The senior se brought 25 poppy flowers and 17 yellow apples. We need to combine these numbers to get the total number of items.

25 poppy flowers + 17 yellow apples = 42 items

Step 2: Identify the number of students who wanted fruit:
Only 10 students wanted fruit, which means they will take 10 yellow apples from the total.

Step 3: Calculate the number of items taken by the students:
Since 10 students wanted fruit, they will take 10 yellow apples. We don't know what happens to the poppy flowers, so we'll focus on the apples.

Number of apples taken = 10

Step 4: Calculate the remaining apples:
The senior se brought 17 yellow apples, and 10 were taken by the students. To find the remaining apples, we subtract the number taken from the total:

17 (total apples) - 10 (apples taken) = 7 apples remaining

Step 5: Calculate the extra apples:
Since the senior se brought 17 apples and only 10 were taken, there are 7 apples remaining. This means the cafeteria ended up with 7 extra apples.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Oliver started with $33 in January.

Step 2: By March, he has spent $4. To find out how much money he has left, we need to subtract $4 from $33.

$33 - $4 = $29

So, Oliver has $29 left after spending $4.

Step 3: Oliver's mom gave him another $32. To find out how much money Oliver has now, we need to add the $32 to the $29 he had left.

$29 + $32 = $61

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: The school had 6 worksheets to grade initially.

Step 2: The teacher graded 4 worksheets, leaving her with:

6 (initial worksheets) - 4 (graded worksheets) = 2 worksheets left to grade

Step 3: However, 18 new worksheets were turned in. The teacher needs to add these to the total number of worksheets she needs to grade.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The school had 7 worksheets to grade initially.

Step 2: She graded 2 worksheets, which means she has completed grading 2 out of the initial 7 worksheets.

Step 3: Another 46 worksheets were turned in, which adds to the total number of worksheets she needs to grade.

To find the new total, we add the initial 7 worksheets to the additional 46 worksheets:

7 (initial) + 46 (additional) = 53

Step 4: Since she had already graded 2 worksheets, we subtract those from the new total to get the remaining worksheets she needs to grade:

53 (new total) - 2 (already graded) = 51

Therefore, she would have to grade a total of 51 worksheets.

Step 2: She sells 5 of the original 6 roses. To find out how many roses she has left, we subtract 5 from 6:

6 - 5 = 1

So, the florist has 1 rose left after selling 5.

Step 3: Later, the florist picks 12 more roses. To find out how many roses she now has, we add the 12 new roses to the 1 rose she had left:

29 - 25 = 4

So, she has 4 worksheets left to grade from the initial batch.

Step 4: Another 29 worksheets are turned in, which means the total number of worksheets to be graded increases by 29.

Step 5: To find the new total number of worksheets to be graded, we add the 4 worksheets she has left to grade from the initial batch to the new 29 worksheets:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that Carol and her neighbor were breaking carrots from their yard. They picked a total of 16 carrots. However, only 38 of the carrots were good. This implies that there were some bad carrots among the 16 they picked.

Step 2: Identify the information given
We know that Carol and her neighbor picked 16 carrots, and only 38 of them were good. This means that the remaining carrots are bad.

Step 3: Calculate the number of good carrots
The problem states that only 38 carrots were good. This means that the number of good carrots is 38.

Step 4: Calculate the number of bad carrots
Since there were 16 carrots in total, and 38 were good, the number of bad carrots can be calculated by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots:

16 (total carrots) - 38 (good carrots) =?

Let's do the subtraction:

16 - 38 = -22

However, this doesn't make sense, as we can't have a negative number of bad carrots. This means that the problem is actually asking for the number of bad carrots, which is the total number of carrots minus the number of good carrots.

So, the correct calculation is:

16 (total carrots) - 38 (good carrots) = 16 - 38 = -22

But we can't have a negative number of bad carrots. To find the correct answer, we need to add the total number of carrots to the number of good carrots:

16 (total carrots) + 38 (good carrots) = 54

This means that there are 54 carrots in total, and 38 of them are good. To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots:

54 (total carrots) - 38 (good carrots) = 54 - 38 = 16

So, the correct answer is that there are 16 bad carrots.<|eot_id|>",7.0,7.0,16.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that Bianca and her daughters were breaking cockes (I assume this is a typo and it should be ""cocks"", which are birds, not carrots). They picked 15 of them, and only 16 were good. We need to find out how many bad carrots they have.

Step 2: Identify the relevant information
We know that Bianca and her mother picked 15 cockes, and only 16 of them were good. This means that the remaining cockes are bad.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bad cockes
Since only 16 of the 15 cockes were good, the remaining cockes must be bad. To find the number of bad cockes, we subtract the number of good cockes from the total number of cockes picked:

15 (total cockes picked) - 16 (good cockes) = -1

Wait, what? This doesn't make sense. There can't be a negative number of bad cockes.

Step 4: Realize the mistake
I think I see the problem. The statement ""only 16 of the carrots were good"" is misleading. It implies that the 16 good cockes are part of the 15 cockes picked, but that's not the case. The 16 good cockes are a separate group, and we don't know how many cockes were picked in total.

Step 5: Re-evaluate the problem
Since we don't know the total number of cockes picked, we can't determine the number of bad cockes. The problem is incomplete or poorly worded.

Step 6: Provide an answer
Unfortunately, we can't provide a definitive answer to this problem because of the ambiguity. We would need more information about the total number of cockes picked and how the 16 good cockes relate to the 15 cockes picked.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Katie baked 7 cupcakes and 5 cookies, and after the sale, she had 8 pastries left to take back home.

Step 2: Determine what we are trying to find.
We want to find out how many pastries Katie sold.

Step 3: Use the information to set up an equation.
Let's say the number of pastries Katie sold is x. Since she had 8 pastries left, she must have started with x + 8 pastries. Since she baked 7 cupcakes and 5 cookies, she must have started with a total of 7 + 5 = 12 pastries. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 8 = 12

Step 4: Solve the equation for x.
Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 12 - 8
x = 4

Step 5: Interpret the result.
Since x represents the number of pastries Katie sold, the result x = 4 means that Katie sold 4 pastries.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of apples available for the students' lunches.
The Ecole staff included 43 red apples and 32 green apples, so the total number of apples is:
43 (red apples) + 32 (green apples) = 75 apples

Step 2: Determine how many apples the cafeteria would have left over if 2 students wanted fruit.
If only 2 students want fruit, they would take a total of:
2 students x 1 apple/student (assuming each student takes 1 apple) = 2 apples

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples the cafeteria would have left over.
The cafeteria initially had 75 apples, and 2 apples were taken by the students. To find the number of apples left over, subtract the number of apples taken from the initial total:
75 apples - 2 apples = 73 apples

Step 4: Determine the number of extra apples the cafeteria has left over.
The cafeteria had 75 apples initially, and they ended up with 73 apples. To find the number of extra apples, subtract the number of apples taken from the initial total:

                    paige passed 43 math problems and 12 science problems for homework. if she finished 44 of the problems at school, how many problems did she have to do for homework?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Paige passed a total of 43 math problems and 12 science problems for homework.

Step 2: To find the total number of problems Paige had to do for homework, we need to add the number of math problems and science problems together:

43 math problems + 12 science problems = 55 problems

Step 3: However, the problem states that Paige finished 44 problems at school. This means that she didn't have to do those 44 problems for homework.

Step 4: To find out how many problems Paige had to do for homework, we need to subtract the number of problems she finished at school from the total number of problems she had to do:

55 problems (total) - 44 problems (finished at school) = 11 problems

Step 5: Therefore, Paige had to do 11 problems for homework.

{The final answer is 11.}<|eot_id|>",11.0,11.0,11.0

                    question:
                    vanessa noticed 16 youtube streams and 48 video files on her flash drive. if she deleted 30 of the files, how many files were still on her flash drive?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Start with the initial number of files Vanessa has on her flash drive, which is 16 YouTube streams and 48 video files.

Step 2: Combine the two numbers to get the total number of files: 16 (YouTube streams) + 48 (video files) = 64 files

Step 3: Vanessa deletes 30 files. To find the number of files she has left, subtract 30 from the total number of files: 64 - 30 =?

Step 4: Perform the subtraction: 64 - 30 = 34

Step 5: The final answer is the number of files Vanessa has left on her flash drive: 34

{The final answer is 34}.<|eot_id|>",34.0,34.0,34.0
"the local website had 6 red apples and 15 green apples for students lunches. but, if only 5 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    the local website had 6 red apples and 15 green apples for students lunches. but, if only 5 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of apples available.
The local website had 6 red apples and 15 green apples, so the total number of apples available is:
6 (red) + 15 (green) = 21 apples

Step 2: Determine how many apples the cafeteria will need to give out.
If only 5 students want fruit, the cafeteria will need to give out a total of 5 apples (assuming each student gets one apple).

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples the cafeteria will give out.
Since there are 5 students, and each student gets one apple, the total number of apples given out will be:
5 apples

Step 4: Calculate the number of apples remaining.
The cafeteria will give out 5 apples, leaving the remaining apples:
21 (initial apples) - 5 (apples given out) = 16 apples

Step 5: Determine the number of extra apples the cafeteria will have.
The cafeteria will have 16 apples remaining, which is 1 more than the initial 15 green apples. Therefore, the cafeteria will have:
1 extra apple

{The final answer is 1 extra apple.}<|eot_id|>",16.0,16.0,1.0
