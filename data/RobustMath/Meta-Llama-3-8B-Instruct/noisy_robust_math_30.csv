Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of dogs John takes care of.
John takes care of 10 dogs.

Step 2: Identify the time each dog takes to walk and take care of their business.
Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent on one dog per day.
Since each dog takes 0.5 hours, the total time spent on one dog per day is 0.5 hours.

Step 4: Calculate the total time spent on all dogs per day.
Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total time spent on all dogs per day is:
0.5 hours/dog × 10 dogs = 5 hours

Step 5: Calculate the total time spent on all dogs per week.
Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on all dogs per week is:
5 hours/day × 7 days = 35 hours

{The final answer is 35 hours}<|eot_id|>",35

                    question:
                    Tracy used a? piece of wire? 4 feet long to ; support! tomato plants. in the garden. The ; wire was. cut. into pieces 6 inches long. How many pieces did she : obtain?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, we can convert 4 feet to inches as follows:

4 feet x 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Step 2: Since Tracy wants to cut the wire into pieces 6 inches long, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces can fit into the total length of the wire (48 inches).

Step 3: To do this, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 inches ÷ 6 inches =?

Step 4: Perform the division:

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Step 5: Since we're dealing with a whole number of pieces, the result of the division (8) is the number of pieces Tracy can obtain.

{The final answer is 8}.<|eot_id|>",8

3 rose bushes × 25 roses/bush = 75 roses

Step 3: Each rose has 8 thorns.
This means each of the 75 roses has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:

75 roses × 8 thorns/rose =?

Step 4: Calculate the total number of thorns.
To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:

75 roses × 8 thorns/rose = 600 thorns

* 2/3 = 0.67 (approximately)

Step 3: Calculate how many hours James slept.

* James slept 0.67 times the number of hours Harry slept.
* Harry slept 9 hours, so James slept 0.67 × 9 = 6 hours.

Step 4: Calculate the difference between the number of hours Harry slept and the number of hours James slept.

* Harry slept 9 hours, and James slept 6 hours.
* The difference is 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

Step 5: Determine how many more hours Harry slept than James.

* Since Harry slept 3 hours more than James, the answer is 3 hours.

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    A classroom has a whiteboard ; which is, shared between the 4 teachers who! take turns using the classroom., Each teacher, has, 2 lessons per. day and uses the ; whiteboard in each lesson. If the : whiteboard! is cleaned? 3. times per lesson, how many times. is : the whiteboard cleaned, in a day?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of teachers who share the whiteboard.
The problem states that there are 4 teachers who share the whiteboard.

Step 2: Determine the number of lessons each teacher has per day.
The problem states that each teacher has 2 lessons per day.

Step 3: Determine the number of times each teacher uses the whiteboard per day.
Since each teacher has 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard in each lesson, each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 x 2 = 4 times per day.

Step 4: Determine the total number of times all teachers use the whiteboard per day.
Since there are 4 teachers, and each teacher uses the whiteboard 4 times per day, the total number of times all teachers use the whiteboard per day is 4 x 4 = 16.

Step 5: Determine the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.
The problem states that the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

Step 6: Determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day.
Since each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day is 2 x 3 = 6.

Step 7: Determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day.
The total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day is 16 (from Step 4) because all teachers use the whiteboard 16 times per day. However, we need to consider that the whiteboard is cleaned 6 times per day (from Step 6). To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to subtract the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson from the total number of times the whiteboard is used per day. This gives us:

16 (total uses per day) - 6 (total cleans per day) = 10

Step 8: {The final answer is} 10.

The whiteboard is cleaned 10 times in a day.<|eot_id|>",24

                    question:
                    Ryan! plants ; 2 flowers, a day in his garden. After 15 days,, how many flowers does : he ; have if 5 did not grow?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Ryan plants 2 flowers every day. To find the total number of flowers after 15 days, we need to multiply the number of flowers planted each day by the number of days.

2 flowers/day × 15 days = 30 flowers

Step 2: However, the problem states that 5 flowers did not grow. This means we need to subtract 5 from the total number of flowers.

30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers

Step 3: This is the answer to the question. Therefore, {The final answer is} 25 flowers.<|eot_id|>",25

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given
Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. This means that Amy's friend count is 20 more than Lily's.

Step 2: Find Lily's friend count
The problem states that Lily made 50 friends. This is a given fact.

Step 3: Find Amy's friend count
Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, we can add 20 to Lily's friend count to find Amy's friend count:

Amy's friend count = Lily's friend count + 20
= 50 + 20
= 70

Step 4: Find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together
To find the total number of friends, we add the number of friends Lily has (50) to the number of friends Amy has (70):

Total number of friends = Lily's friend count + Amy's friend count
= 50 + 70
= 120

                    A : tank of, water has a. depth ; of 17 : feet ; on Monday. ; On Tuesday, : the. tank had. 7 feet more water.. On Wednesday, : the depth of the, water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. What is the tank’s water depth on Wednesday?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

Step 2: On Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water, so we need to add 7 feet to the initial depth:

17 feet (Monday) + 7 feet = 24 feet (Tuesday)

Step 3: On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find this, we need to find two-thirds of 24 feet:

Two-thirds of 24 feet = (2/3) × 24 feet = 16 feet

Step 4: Since the depth on Wednesday is two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday, we subtract the extra 7 feet added on Tuesday from the Tuesday depth to find the Wednesday depth:

24 feet (Tuesday) - 7 feet = 17 feet (Tuesday) + 7 feet - 7 feet = 17 feet

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 17 feet.

{The final answer is 17 feet}.<|eot_id|>",16

* Ethel has $8.
* Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has.

Step 2: Let's break down the information about Jimmy's money:

* Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has.
* Since Ethel has $8, twice the money Ethel has is 2 x $8 = $16.
* Jimmy has $2 more than $16, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.

Step 3: Therefore, Jimmy has $18.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Andy plants 90 geraniums.

2. The problem states that Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. This means we need to subtract 40 from the number of geraniums to get the number of petunias.

90 (geraniums) - 40 = 50

So, Andy plants 50 petunias.

3. To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias.

90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the amount spent on advertising for the first year.
The company spends $15,000 on advertising for a year.

Step 2: Identify the amount spent on advertising for the second year.
The company spends a third of the amount spent in the first year on advertising for another year. To find this amount, we need to calculate a third of $15,000.

$15,000 ÷ 3 = $5,000

Step 3: Add the amounts spent on advertising for both years.
The company spent $15,000 in the first year and $5,000 in the second year.

$15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000

How? many Pizzas does : John need to order?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of friends, including John.
The problem states that there are 20 friends in total, and John is one of them. Therefore, the total number of friends is 20 + 1 = 21.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices needed for each friend.
The problem states that each friend wants to have 4 slices. Since there are 21 friends, the total number of slices needed is 21 x 4 = 84.

Step 3: Determine the number of slices per pizza.
The problem states that pizzas are sold sliced into 8 portions. Therefore, each pizza has 8 slices.

Step 4: Calculate the number of pizzas needed.
To find the number of pizzas needed, we need to divide the total number of slices needed (84) by the number of slices per pizza (8). This gives us:

84 ÷ 8 = 10.5

Since you can't order a fraction of a pizza, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that each friend gets at least 4 slices.

Step 5: Calculate the final answer.
Rounding up 10.5 to the nearest whole number, we get:

{The final answer is 11 pizzas.}<|eot_id|>",10

* Cocoa: $4.20
* Laundry: $9.45
* Package of pasta: $1.35

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the items:

$4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.90

Step 3: The mother pays $20.00 for the items. To find the change, we need to subtract the total cost from the payment:

$20.00 - $14.90 = $5.10

Step 4: The change is $5.10. The cashier will give the mother $5.10 in change.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Annika brought $50 to the town fair.

We start with the initial amount of money Annika has: $50

Step 2: She spent half of it on food and snacks.

To find out how much she spent on food and snacks, we need to find half of $50. To do this, we can divide $50 by 2:

$50 ÷ 2 = $25

So, Annika spent $25 on food and snacks.

Step 3: She spent an additional $10 for rides.

Annika already spent $25 on food and snacks, and now she's spending an additional $10 for rides. We add these two amounts together:

$25 + $10 = $35

So, Annika has spent a total of $35 so far.

Step 4: Find out how much is left.

To find out how much is left, we subtract the amount spent ($35) from the initial amount ($50):

$50 - $35 = $15

Step 2: After the end of the fourth week, Josh is preparing to perform at the talent show. He has been practicing for a month, so he has added 3 balls to his original 3 balls. This means he has a total of:

3 (initial balls) + 3 (balls added each week) = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 balls

Step 3: When Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 balls. Two of them are caught by people in the crowd, but one gets lost completely.

Step 4: Josh is left with the balls he has left after dropping the 3. He started with 12 balls, and dropped 3, so he has:

12 - 3 = 9 balls left

Step 5: Josh starts juggling on stage with the remaining balls. He has 9 balls left.

{The final answer is 9 balls.}<|eot_id|>",4

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that Andrea saved some money, then spent the rest of it on an $11 sweater and gave her brother $4. We are asked to find out how much Andrea saved initially.

Step 2: Identify the given information
We know that Andrea had $36 initially. We also know that she spent the rest of her money on the sweater and gave her brother $4.

Step 3: Calculate the amount Andrea spent
Andrea spent the rest of her money on the sweater and gave her brother $4. To find out how much she spent, we need to subtract the amount she gave her brother from the cost of the sweater:

$11 (cost of sweater) - $4 (given to brother) = $7

So, Andrea spent $7.

Step 4: Calculate the amount Andrea saved
Andrea had $36 initially. She spent $7, which means she has $36 - $7 = $29 left. Since she saved some money initially, the amount she saved must be the initial amount she had, which is $36.

Step 5: Find the amount Andrea saved initially
We know that Andrea saved some money initially, and we want to find out how much she saved. We can subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount she had:

$36 (initial amount) - $29 (amount spent) = $7

So, Andrea saved $7 initially.

{The final answer is $7}.<|eot_id|>",21

There are 6 girls in the park.

Step 2: Identify the unknown information
The number of boys in the park is unknown.

Step 3: Understand the relationship between girls and boys
The problem states that there are twice the number of boys as there are girls. This means that if there are 6 girls, there are 2 x 6 = 12 boys.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of kids
To find the total number of kids, we add the number of girls and the number of boys: 6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is equal to 12 rolls.

Step 2: She gave one roll each to her 6 children, so she gave away 6 rolls.

Step 3: This means she has 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Step 4: She broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces and fed them to the chickens.

Step 5: Since she broke each of the 6 rolls into 8 pieces, she will have a total of 6 x 8 = 48 pieces of rolls.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

Step 1: Ray had 25 lollipops initially.

Step 2: Ray kept 5 lollipops. To find out how many lollipops he has left, subtract 5 from 25:

25 - 5 = 20

So, Ray has 20 lollipops left.

Step 3: Ray shared the remaining lollipops equally with his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, divide the number of lollipops Ray has left (20) by the number of friends (4):

20 ÷ 4 = 5

Step 4: Each friend received 5 lollipops.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Stetson made a bet with Alec that he would give up $10 for each orange he eats. They picked 60 oranges, and Stetson ate 2/5 of them.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of oranges Stetson ate
To find the total number of oranges Stetson ate, multiply the total number of oranges (60) by the fraction 2/5.

60 x (2/5) = 60 x 0.4 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Stetson gave up
Since Stetson ate 24 oranges, and he gave up $10 for each orange, multiply the number of oranges by the amount of money per orange.

24 x $10 = $240

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Brett is 14 years old, and in four years, his sister Angela will be three times as old as he is now.

Step 2: Identify the key information
We know Brett's current age (14) and the number of years that will pass before Angela becomes three times as old as Brett (4 years).

Step 3: Calculate Angela's age in 4 years
Since Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old in 4 years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett, which means she will be:

18 × 3 = 54 years old

Step 4: Find Angela's current age
To find Angela's current age, we subtract the 4 years that will pass before she becomes three times as old as Brett from her age in 4 years:

54 - 4 = 50

Step 5: Find Angela's current age relative to Brett
Since Brett is currently 14 years old, Angela's current age relative to Brett is:

50 - 14 = 36

So, Angela is currently 36 years old.

{The final answer is} Angela is currently 36 years old.<|eot_id|>",38

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Identify the given information:

* The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours.
* We need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

**Step 2:** Calculate the plane's speed:

* Speed = Distance / Time = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour (mph)

**Step 3:** Calculate the time it would take to travel the initial distance:

* Time = Distance / Speed = 1200 miles / 400 mph = 3 hours

**Step 4:** Calculate the additional distance to be traveled:

* Additional distance = 2000 miles (given)

**Step 5:** Calculate the additional time required to travel the additional distance:

* Time = Additional distance / Speed = 2000 miles / 400 mph = 5 hours

**Step 6:** Since we want to know how many additional hours it would take to travel the additional distance, we subtract the initial time from the total time:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many croissants Juan wants to make per day.
Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day.

Step 2: Convert the number of dozen croissants to the number of individual croissants.
1 dozen = 12 croissants
4 dozen = 4 x 12 = 48 croissants

Step 3: Determine how much butter is needed to make 1 dozen croissants.
It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.

Step 4: Determine how much butter is needed to make 4 dozen croissants.
Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can multiply this amount by 4 to find the amount needed to make 4 dozen croissants:
1/4 pound x 4 = 1 pound

Step 5: Determine how many days Juan wants to make croissants.
He wants to make croissants for a week, which is 7 days.

Step 6: Determine how much butter is needed for the entire week.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial amounts of candy each person has:

* Robert has 3 pounds of candy
* Cindy has 5 pounds of candy
* Aaron has 4 pounds of candy

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of candy they have:

* Total candy = 3 pounds (Robert) + 5 pounds (Cindy) + 4 pounds (Aaron) = 12 pounds

Step 3: Since they want to share the candy equally, they will divide the total amount of candy by the number of people:

* Number of people = 3 (Robert, Cindy, Aaron)
* Total candy divided by number of people = 12 pounds / 3 people = 4 pounds per person

Step 4: Since they are sharing the candy equally, each person will receive the same amount of candy. Therefore, the amount of candy each person will have is:

* Robert: 4 pounds
* Cindy: 4 pounds
* Aaron: 4 pounds

The final answer is: Each person will have 4 pounds of candy after sharing equally.<|eot_id|>",4

                    question:
                    The! local firefighters are! doing, a “fill. the boot” fundraiser. Their goal is to raise $6300., After the first 3! hours, they. have raised $2100.  ; For, how, many hours do. they have to fundraise in total to reach, their goal, assuming an : equal : amount raised in every hour?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the goal
The local firefighters want to raise a total of $6300.

Step 2: Identify the amount raised so far
After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.

Step 3: Calculate the amount raised per hour
To find the amount raised per hour, we can divide the total amount raised so far ($2100) by the number of hours (3):

$2100 ÷ 3 = $700 per hour

Step 4: Calculate the remaining amount to raise
To find the remaining amount to raise, we subtract the amount raised so far ($2100) from the goal ($6300):

$6300 - $2100 = $4200 remaining

Step 5: Calculate the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount
Since they want to raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount ($4200) by the amount raised per hour ($700):

$4200 ÷ $700 = 6 hours

Step 6: Add the initial 3 hours to the total hours needed
Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, we add those hours to the remaining hours needed:

3 hours (already done) + 6 hours (remaining) = 9 hours

Step 7: Confirm the answer
The local firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 9 hours to reach their goal of $6300.

{The final answer is 9 hours}.<|eot_id|>",9

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Greg found $20 while walking down the street with his 3 younger siblings. We also know that he decided to split the money equally among his siblings.

Step 2: Determine the total amount of money to be split.
The total amount of money is $20.

Step 3: Identify the number of people to split the money among.
There are 4 people to split the money among: Greg and his 3 younger siblings.

Step 4: Calculate the equal share for each person.
To find the equal share, we can divide the total amount of money ($20) by the number of people (4).

$20 ÷ 4 = $5

Step 5: Determine the amount of money each person gets.
Since the money is split equally, each person gets the same amount. In this case, each person gets $5.

How, many like to play! video! games if? the number that : like to play. music is twice the number that, prefer playing basketball?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of students in the class.
50 students in the class.

Step 2: Identify the number of students who like to bake.
10 students like to bake.

Step 3: Identify the number of students who like to play basketball.
5 students like to play basketball.

Step 4: Identify the number of students who like to play video games or play music.
The rest of the students (50 - 10 - 5 = 35 students) like to play video games or play music.

Step 5: Identify the number of students who like to play music.
Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball, we can set up an equation:

Number of students who like to play music = 2 × Number of students who like to play basketball
Let's call the number of students who like to play basketball ""x"". Then, the number of students who like to play music is 2x.

Step 6: Use the information from Step 4 to write an equation.
The total number of students who like to play video games or play music is 35. Since the number of students who like to play music is 2x, the number of students who like to play video games is:

35 - 2x

Step 7: Write an equation using the information from Step 6.
The total number of students who like to play video games or play music is equal to the sum of the number of students who like to play video games and the number of students who like to play music:

35 = 2x + (35 - 2x)

Step 8: Simplify the equation.
Combine like terms:

35 = 35 - x

Step 9: Solve for x.
Add x to both sides of the equation:

x = 5

Step 10: Find the number of students who like to play video games.
The number of students who like to play video games is:

35 - 2x = 35 - 2(5) = 25

{The final answer is 25 students like to play video games.}<|eot_id|>",25

$80 (initial amount) - $20 (spent on ball) = $60

Step 2: Marissa used the remaining money to buy candy bars for Jimmy. Each candy bar costs $5. How many candy bars can she buy with the remaining $60?

To find the answer, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of each candy bar:

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

Step 3: Since Marissa can buy 12 candy bars with the remaining $60, she buys 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

{The final answer is} 12 candy bars.<|eot_id|>",12

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the amount of bottle caps Damien finds each day.
He finds 10 bottle caps per day.

Step 2: Identify the value of each bottle cap.
Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Damien makes each day.
To do this, we multiply the number of bottle caps he finds each day (10) by the value of each bottle cap ($0.25).

10 bottle caps/day × $0.25/bottle cap = $2.50/day

Step 4: Since Damien finds bottle caps for 30 days in a month, we need to calculate the total amount of money he makes in that time period.
To do this, we multiply the amount of money he makes each day ($2.50) by the number of days (30).

$2.50/day × 30 days = $75

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that there are:
* 12 female lions
* Half as many male lions as female lions (since the problem states ""half as many"")
* 14 lion cubs

Step 2: Calculate the number of male lions.
Since there are 12 female lions, and half as many male lions, we can set up the equation:

Number of male lions = 12 / 2
Number of male lions = 6

Step 3: Add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to get the total number of lions in the enclosure.
We have:
* 12 female lions
* 6 male lions
* 14 lion cubs

Total number of lions = 12 + 6 + 14
Total number of lions = 32

Step 4: Verify the answer.

* The choir plans to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice.
* ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long.
* The choir plans to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.
* ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.

Step 2: Calculate the total time spent singing ""Deck the Halls""

* Since the choir plans to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, we need to multiply the length of one performance by 2.
* 150 seconds (length of one performance) x 2 = 300 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent singing ""Jingle Bells""

* Since the choir plans to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once, we can simply use the given length of 240 seconds.

Step 4: Calculate the total time spent caroling

We know that Daisy bought:

* A bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds
* A bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes
* A bag of carrots that weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes

Step 2: Calculate the weight of sweet potatoes
Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, we can multiply the weight of potatoes by 2:

Sweet potatoes = 5 pounds x 2 = 10 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the weight of carrots
We know that the carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. To find the weight of carrots, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of sweet potatoes:

Carrots = 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm.

Step 2: Write an equation for Farmer Smith's farm
Let's say Farmer Brown's farm is x acres. Then, Farmer Smith's farm is 2x acres (since it's twice the size). Since it's 100 acres more, we add 100 to 2x to get:

2x + 100

Step 3: Substitute x with 200 (Farmer Brown's farm size)
Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, we can substitute x with 200 in the equation:

2(200) + 100

Step 4: Calculate the value of Farmer Smith's farm
2(200) = 400 (multiplying 2 by 200)
400 + 100 = 500 (adding 100 to 400)

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Step 5: Calculate the total acres of both farms
Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.
Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

To find the total acres, we add the two values:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the amount Adam's mother gave him for the trousers.
The problem states that Adam's mother gave him $6 for the trousers. This is a fixed amount.

Step 2: Identify the amount Adam's father gave him for the trousers.
The problem states that Adam's father gave him twice as much as what his mother gave him. Since his mother gave him $6, his father gave him twice that amount, which is:

$6 x 2 = $12

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Adam received from his parents.
Adam received $6 from his mother and $12 from his father. To find the total amount, we add these two amounts together:

$6 + $12 = $18

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the trousers.
The problem states that the trousers cost $30. Adam's parents gave him a total of $18, which is less than the cost of the trousers.

Step 5: Calculate how much Adam needs to contribute from his savings.
To find out how much Adam needs to contribute, we subtract the amount his parents gave him from the cost of the trousers:

                    It! takes. James 10 minutes! to read 3 pages of his book before : he goes to. bed., He reads 18 pages. of his book and then decides to go? to : sleep., How long does James ; spend reading, in minutes?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages of his book.

Step 2: Convert the given information into a rate of pages per minute.
To do this, we can divide the number of pages (3) by the time taken (10 minutes):

3 pages / 10 minutes = 0.3 pages per minute

Step 3: Use the rate found in Step 2 to find the time taken to read 18 pages.
We can multiply the rate (0.3 pages per minute) by the number of pages (18) to find the time taken:

18 pages / 0.3 pages per minute = 60 minutes

Step 4: Convert the answer from Step 3 to the required unit (minutes).
Since the answer is already in minutes, we don't need to convert it.

The final answer is: {The final answer is 60 minutes}.<|eot_id|>",60

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
We are given that Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces (since 500 / 2 = 250).

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pieces Teddy placed
Teddy finished another 500-piece puzzle within an hour. This means he placed a total of 250 pieces (from the first puzzle) + 500 pieces (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pieces Teddy placed during that hour
Since Teddy finished both puzzles within an hour, the time taken to place the pieces is equal to the time taken to finish both puzzles. Therefore, the number of pieces Teddy placed during that hour is equal to the total number of pieces he placed, which is 750.

{The final answer is 750.}<|eot_id|>",750

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days. Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day.

Step 2: Calculate Sofie's total distance in 7 days
Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, her total distance in 7 days will be:
10 miles/day × 7 days = 70 miles

Step 3: Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, Brian's distance will be half of Sofie's distance
Brian's distance in 7 days will be:
70 miles (Sofie's distance) ÷ 2 = 35 miles

Step 4: The answer is the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial amount of money Jack has.
Jack had $100.

Step 2: Identify the amount of money Sophia gave Jack.
Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100.

To find the amount of money Sophia gave Jack, we need to calculate 1/5 of $100.

Step 3: Calculate 1/5 of $100.
To do this, we can divide $100 by 5:

$100 ÷ 5 = $20

So, Sophia gave Jack $20.

Step 4: Add the amount Sophia gave Jack to the initial amount Jack had.
Jack had $100 initially, and Sophia gave him $20. To find the new total amount of money Jack has, we add these two amounts together:

$100 + $20 = $120

* Each whale has 40 gallons of blood.
* A shark has three times as much blood as a whale.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of blood a shark has

* Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and each whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has:
40 gallons (whale's blood) x 3 = 120 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the amount of blood ten sharks have

* Since we want to find the total amount of blood for ten sharks, we multiply the amount of blood one shark has by 10:
120 gallons (one shark) x 10 = 1200 gallons

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
* Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.
* They fill up 10 packs of balloons.
* Each pack has 30 balloons.
* By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of balloons filled
* Since there are 10 packs of balloons, and each pack has 30 balloons, we multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack:
10 packs × 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons

Step 3: Subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons filled
* We subtract the 12 balloons left from the total number of balloons filled:
300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons

Step 4: Determine how many balloons were thrown
* Since the problem asks for the number of balloons thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons filled:
288 balloons - 12 balloons = 276 balloons

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos initially.

Step 2: After giving some pomelos to her friend, Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had.

Step 3: Since Eve is left with 1/4 of the original 20 pomelos, we can set up the equation:

1/4 × 20 = x

where x is the number of pomelos Eve is left with.

Step 4: To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

x = (1/4 × 20) × 4
x = 20 × 1/4
x = 5

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

Step 5: To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to subtract the number of pomelos she is left with from the original number of pomelos:

Number of pomelos given away = Original number of pomelos - Number of pomelos Eve is left with
= 20 - 5
= 15

{The final answer is 15 pomelos}.<|eot_id|>",15

40 games/year × 4 years = 160 games

Step 3: Ara scores 21 points in each game. To find the total number of points she has scored, we multiply the total number of games by her score per game:

160 games × 21 points/game =?

Step 4: To calculate the total number of points, we multiply the number of games by the score per game:

160 games × 21 points/game = 3360 points

2. She uploads 7 photos in one batch and 6 batches each day. So, in one day, she uploads:

7 photos/batch × 6 batches/day = 7 × 6 = 42 photos

3. To find out how many days it will take her to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos (210) by the number of photos she uploads in one day (42):

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Right now, there is 200 feet of dock.

Step 2: Calculate the total feet of line needed for the existing dock
Since there is 200 feet of dock, and the caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the number of feet of dock by 3:
200 feet of dock x 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Step 3: Subtract the amount of new line already available
The caretaker has 6 feet of new line. We subtract this from the total amount of line needed:
600 feet of line - 6 feet of new line =?

Step 4: Calculate the remaining amount of line needed
600 feet of line - 6 feet of new line = 594 feet of line

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Billy has 8 customers on Tuesday.

Step 2: The first 3 customers buy one DVD each. To find the total number of DVDs sold by these customers, we multiply the number of customers by the number of DVDs each customer buys:

3 customers x 1 DVD/customer = 3 DVDs

Step 3: The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each. To find the total number of DVDs sold by these customers, we multiply the number of customers by the number of DVDs each customer buys:

2 customers x 2 DVDs/customer = 4 DVDs

Step 4: The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so they contribute 0 DVDs to the total.

Step 5: To find the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we add the number of DVDs sold by the first 3 customers, the next 2 customers, and the last 3 customers:

* James

We know that:

* James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 11 years old.
* Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.

Step 2: Use the information about Amy and Corey to determine Amy's age:

* Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, who is 11 years old.
* Therefore, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Step 3: Use the information about Amy and Jackson to determine Jackson's age:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of vehicles at the port.
The customs officer counted 2 containers of imported vehicles, each having 5 vehicles inside. Therefore, the initial number of vehicles at the port is:

2 containers x 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

Step 2: Determine the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day.
The problem states that the total number of vehicles at the port became 30 on the second day. This means that the number of vehicles increased by 20 (30 - 10 = 20) on the second day.

Step 3: Calculate the number of containers brought in on the second day.
Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers needed to add 20 vehicles to the initial 10 vehicles is:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Step 4: Determine the total number of containers at the port after the second day.
The initial 2 containers plus the 4 new containers brought in on the second day make a total of:

2 containers + 4 containers = 6 containers

Step 5: The final answer is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of cars available for rent, which is 20.

Step 2: Identify the number of automatic cars, which is 12.

Step 3: Identify the number of manual cars, which is 4.

Step 4: Since the rest of the cars are semi-automatic, we can find the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the number of automatic cars and manual cars from the total number of cars:

20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4

So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars.

Step 5: To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we can divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100:

                    question:
                   ? A water, tank is filled with 120 liters of! water.. Celine used 90 liters of water from the : tank to? water her : small : garden. She! was then : able to collect rainwater ; that is twice as much as what, was left.. How many liters of water are ; in the tank? now?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Celine started with 120 liters of water in the tank.

Step 2: She used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her garden. To find out how much water is left, we subtract 90 from 120:

120 - 90 = 30

So, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank.

Step 3: Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. To find out how much rainwater she collected, we multiply the amount left (30) by 2:

30 x 2 = 60

So, Celine collected 60 liters of rainwater.

Step 4: To find the total amount of water in the tank now, we add the amount left (30) to the amount of rainwater collected (60):

30 + 60 = 90

Step 5: Therefore, there are 90 liters of water in the tank now.

{The final answer is 90 liters.}<|eot_id|>",90

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the cost of Carlos' canoe rental for 3 hours.

* The cost of the canoe rental is $30 per hour.
* Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours, so the total cost is:
$30/hour × 3 hours = $90

Step 2: Calculate the cost of Benji's banana boat raft rental for 5 hours.

* The cost of the raft rental is $18 per hour.
* Benji uses the raft for 5 hours, so the total cost is:
$18/hour × 5 hours = $90

Step 3: Add the costs of Carlos' and Benji's rentals to find the total cost.

* Carlos' canoe rental cost: $90
* Benji's raft rental cost: $90
* Total cost: $90 + $90 = $180

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: We are given that John has 54 candies. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can set up an equation:

John's candies = 2 x Robert's candies

Substituting John's candies with 54, we get:

54 = 2 x Robert's candies

Step 2: To find Robert's candies, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Robert's candies = 54 / 2
= 27

So Robert has 27 candies.

Step 3: We are also given that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Since Robert has 27 candies, James has:

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
= 27 + 6
= 33

Step 4: Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. To do this, we subtract James' candies from John's candies:

John's candies - James' candies = 54 - 33
= 21

{The final answer is} John has 21 more candies than James.<|eot_id|>",21

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Chris has 6 trees in his yard.

Step 2: Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. To find out how many trees Ferdinand has, we need to find half of 6.

Half of 6 is: 6 ÷ 2 = 3

So, Ferdinand has 3 trees in his yard.

Step 3: Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. To find out how many trees Harry has, we need to find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has, and then add 5.

Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has is: 3 × 2 = 6

Adding 5 to this result gives: 6 + 5 = 11

So, Harry has 11 trees in his yard.

Step 4: We need to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard. To do this, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has.

Number of trees in Harry's yard - Number of trees in Ferdinand's yard =?

11 (Harry's trees) - 3 (Ferdinand's trees) = 8

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Will buys 15 oranges.

* We know that Will buys 15 oranges, and we don't have any information yet about how many oranges will be washed.

Step 2: Will asks his 2 sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old.

* This means that each son will wash a number of oranges equal to their age.

Step 3: The oldest son is 8 years old.

* This means that the oldest son will wash 8 oranges.

Step 4: The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son.

* Since the oldest son is 8 years old, the youngest son is half of that, which is 4 years old.

Step 5: The youngest son will wash 4 oranges.

* Since the youngest son is 4 years old, he will wash 4 oranges.

Step 6: Add the number of oranges washed by each son.

* The oldest son will wash 8 oranges, and the youngest son will wash 4 oranges. In total, they will wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Step 7: Subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges.

* Will bought 15 oranges, and 12 oranges were washed. To find the number of oranges left unwashed, we subtract 12 from 15: 15 - 12 = 3.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies.

Step 2: For the roses, April needs twice as many plant pots as she needs for the daisies. Since she needs 30 plant pots for the daisies, she needs:

2 x 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses

Step 3: April needs a total of 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots for the daisies and roses.

Step 4: April already has 100 plant pots from the garden center. To find out how many plant pots she has left, we need to subtract the number of plant pots she needs from the total number of plant pots she has:

100 - 90 = 10

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest.

Step 2: One of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw. To find the number of fairies her friend saw, we need to find half of 50.

50 ÷ 2 = 25

So, her friend saw 25 fairies.

Step 3: These 25 fairies came from the east and joined the fairies that were already there. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies initially, and her friend saw 25, the total number of fairies that were already there is:

50 (initial fairies) + 25 (fairies that came from the east) = 75

Step 4: Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the remaining number of fairies, we need to subtract 30 from the total number of fairies that were there.

75 - 30 = 45

Step 5: Therefore, there are 45 fairies remaining.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Jackson is planting tulips. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. He buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips. We need to find out how many rows of flowers he can plant.

Step 2: Calculate the number of rows of red tulips
Jackson buys 36 red tulips. Since he can fit 6 red tulips in a row, we can divide 36 by 6 to find the number of rows of red tulips:

36 ÷ 6 = 6

So, Jackson can plant 6 rows of red tulips.

Step 3: Calculate the number of rows of blue tulips
Jackson buys 24 blue tulips. Since he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, we can divide 24 by 8 to find the number of rows of blue tulips:

24 ÷ 8 = 3

So, Jackson can plant 3 rows of blue tulips.

Step 4: Determine the total number of rows
To find the total number of rows, we need to add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips:

6 (red rows) + 3 (blue rows) = 9

So, Jackson can plant 9 rows of flowers.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of bottles Bill already has.
Bill has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. To find the total number of bottles, we multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles per case:

2 cases × 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Step 2: Calculate the total number of bottles needed for the party.
Bill wants to have 2 bottles of water for each of the 70 guests. To find the total number of bottles needed, we multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest:

70 guests × 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Step 3: Subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles needed.
To find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

140 bottles (needed) - 48 bottles (already have) = 92 bottles

{The final answer is} Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.<|eot_id|>",92

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's identify the information we know:

* Shiloh is 44 years old today.
* In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

Step 2: Let's translate the second statement into an equation:

Let x be the nephew's current age. In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. According to the problem, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew at that time. So, we can set up the equation:

51 = 3x

Step 3: Simplify the equation:

51 = 3x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 51/3
x = 17

Step 4: Since x represents the nephew's age in 7 years, we need to subtract 7 from x to find the nephew's current age:

Nephew's current age = x - 7
= 17 - 7
= 10

Step 5: The final answer is:

                    Four dogs sat? in a line? within the veterinarian's, waiting room.  The first? dog was? the, Affenpinscher,? who, weighed only 10 : pounds.  Next to him? sat a Dachshund, who? weighed twice as much as ; the Affenpinscher.  Next to the. Dachshund sat a Papillon,! who weighed! one-fourth as much ; as! the ; Dachshund. . And at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, ; who weighed 44 times the weight of ; the? Papillon.  How much did, the Mastiff weigh,! in pounds?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the weights of each dog:

* Affenpinscher: 10 pounds
* Dachshund: twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so 2 x 10 = 20 pounds
* Papillon: one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so 20 / 4 = 5 pounds
* Mastiff: 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so 44 x 5 = 220 pounds

Step 2: Write down the information:

* Affenpinscher: 10 pounds
* Dachshund: 20 pounds
* Papillon: 5 pounds
* Mastiff: 220 pounds

Step 3: Identify the pattern:

* The weights of the dogs are increasing by a factor of 2 (Affenpinscher to Dachshund) and then decreasing by a factor of 4 (Dachshund to Papillon), and then increasing by a factor of 44 (Papillon to Mastiff).

Step 4: Use the pattern to find the weight of the Mastiff:

* The Mastiff's weight is 44 times the weight of the Papillon, which is 5 pounds. Therefore, the Mastiff's weight is 44 x 5 = 220 pounds.

{The final answer is 220 pounds.}<|eot_id|>",220

How much more did the basketball coach spend than? the baseball coach?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of the baseball coach's purchase

The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of baseballs by the cost per baseball:

9 baseballs x $3 per baseball = $27

Step 2: Determine the cost of the basketball coach's purchase

The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of basketballs by the cost per basketball:

8 basketballs x $14 per basketball = $112

Step 3: Find the difference in cost between the two coaches

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we subtract the cost of the baseball coach's purchase from the cost of the basketball coach's purchase:

$112 (basketball coach's cost) - $27 (baseball coach's cost) = $85

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. This is a given fact.

Step 2: He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. To find the number of truck stamps, we add 3 to the number of snowflake stamps:

16 (snowflake stamps) + 3 = 19

So, Max bought 19 truck stamps.

Step 3: He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. To find the number of rose stamps, we subtract 9 from the number of truck stamps:

19 (truck stamps) - 9 = 10

So, Max bought 10 rose stamps.

Step 4: We need to find the total number of stamps Max bought. We add the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps:

16 (snowflake stamps) + 19 (truck stamps) + 10 (rose stamps) = 45

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the number of vanilla scents sold
The company sells 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is:
5 x 4 = 20

Step 2: Identify the number of fruity scents sold
The company sells 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, so the total number of fruity scents sold is:
2 x 8 = 16

Step 3: Find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents
To find the difference, subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
20 - 16 = 4

Step 4: Determine if the difference is positive or negative
Since the result is positive (4), it means that more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. To find the total amount he earns from selling eggplants, we multiply the number of eggplants by the price per eggplant:

20 eggplants x $3/eggplant = $60

Step 2: Bennet wants to make a total of $135. Since he has already earned $60 from selling eggplants, he needs to earn an additional amount to reach his target:

$135 (target) - $60 (earned from eggplants) = $75

Step 3: Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he needs to earn from selling corn to reach his target, we subtract the amount he has already earned from eggplants from his target:

$75 (amount needed) - $0 (already earned from corn) = $75

Step 4: Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

25 ears of corn x price per ear of corn = $75

Step 5: To find the price per ear of corn, we divide both sides of the equation by 25:

price per ear of corn = $75 ÷ 25

price per ear of corn = $3

Step 6: Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he has already earned $60 from eggplants, he needs to earn $75 from selling corn. To earn this amount, he needs to sell each ear of corn for $3.

{The final answer is} Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.<|eot_id|>",3

                    question:
                    ; Carson lives : in an old! house : where? the pipes will freeze if the temperature, inside the house falls below 32, degrees. ; Every log ; of wood Carson burns heats. the house ; up by 5 degrees., If it was 45 degrees during the day, and. it's 33 degrees : colder during, the night ; compared to? the day, how many ; logs : does Carson need to burn to prevent the, pipes from freezing?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial temperature inside the house.
The problem states that it was 45 degrees during the day. Since the temperature drops by 33 degrees at night, we can calculate the initial temperature at night:

Initial temperature = 45 degrees (day) - 33 degrees (drop) = 12 degrees

{Step 1: Initial temperature is 12 degrees}

Step 2: Determine the target temperature to prevent pipes from freezing.
The problem states that the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Since we want to prevent freezing, we need to heat the house to a temperature above 32 degrees.

Target temperature = 32 degrees + 1 degree (to ensure the pipes don't freeze) = 33 degrees

{Step 2: Target temperature is 33 degrees}

Step 3: Calculate the temperature change needed to reach the target temperature.
The initial temperature is 12 degrees, and we need to heat the house to 33 degrees. To find the temperature change, we subtract the initial temperature from the target temperature:

Temperature change = 33 degrees (target) - 12 degrees (initial) = 21 degrees

{Step 3: Temperature change needed is 21 degrees}

Step 4: Determine how many logs of wood Carson needs to burn to heat the house by 5 degrees each.
The problem states that every log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find the number of logs needed to heat the house by 21 degrees, we divide the temperature change by 5 degrees:

Number of logs = Temperature change / 5 degrees
= 21 degrees / 5 degrees
= 4.2 logs

{Step 4: Carson needs to burn 4.2 logs of wood}

{The final answer is 4.2 logs}<|eot_id|>",4

How much. money? will Mike have ; left over if. he pays! with a $50.00 ; bill?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Mike needs a new pair of jeans and finds his favorite pair on sale for 25% off the original price.

Step 2: Calculate the discount
The original price of the jeans is $40. To find the discount, multiply the original price by the discount percentage (25%):

$40 x 0.25 = $10

So, the discount is $10.

Step 3: Calculate the sale price
Subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:

$40 - $10 = $30

The sale price is $30.

Step 4: Calculate the amount Mike pays
Mike pays with a $50 bill. Since he's getting the jeans at a discounted price, he'll pay the sale price of $30.

Step 5: Calculate the change Mike gets
To find the change Mike gets, subtract the amount he pays ($30) from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will get $20 in change.

{The final answer is: Mike will have $20 left over if he pays with a $50.00 bill.}<|eot_id|>",20

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
We have two cars, Car A and Car B, driving on a highway. Car A is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, and Car B is traveling at an average speed of 70 miles per hour. We want to find out how many miles will separate them after 2 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by each car in 2 hours
Distance = Speed x Time
For Car A: Distance = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles
For Car B: Distance = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

Step 3: Find the difference in distance traveled
The difference in distance traveled by the two cars is the distance between them. To find this, subtract the distance traveled by Car A from the distance traveled by Car B:

Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Step 4: Determine the direction of travel
Since Car B is traveling at a higher speed than Car A, it will eventually pass Car A. Therefore, the direction of travel is from Car A to Car B.

Step 5: Calculate the final distance between the cars
Since Car B has traveled 20 miles farther than Car A in 2 hours, the final distance between the cars is:

Final Distance = 20 miles

Step 2: Determine the total number of packages of dog food Kimberly bought.
Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.

Step 3: Determine the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought.
Each package of cat food contains 11 tins, so the total number of tins of cat food is:
8 packages x 11 tins/package = 88 tins

Step 4: Determine the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought.
Each package of dog food contains 6 tins, so the total number of tins of dog food is:
6 packages x 6 tins/package = 36 tins

Step 5: Find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food to determine how many more tins of cat food Kimberly bought.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can.

This means that if Saskay can lift a mountain of height x, Kagiyami can lift a mountain of height 4x.

Step 2: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can.

This means that if Kagiyami can lift a mountain of height 4x, Naruto can lift a mountain of height 10(4x) = 40x.

Step 3: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can.

This means that if Pompei can lift a mountain of height 1 inch, Saskay can lift a mountain of height 12(1 inch) = 12 inches = 1 foot.

Step 4: Since Saskay can lift a mountain of height 1 foot, and Naruto can lift a mountain 40 times higher than Kagiyami can, Naruto can lift a mountain of height 40(1 foot) = 40 feet.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* A farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from a cow.
* He has 3 cows.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of milk produced by the 3 cows in a day.

* Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the total amount of milk produced by 3 cows is:
3 cows x 5 liters/cow = 15 liters of milk a day

Step 3: Determine the amount of milk needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

* The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. Since he already has 15 liters from the 3 cows, he needs to produce an additional:
25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters of milk a day

Step 4: Calculate how many more cows are needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk a day.

* Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs:
10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 more cows

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000. This means he needs to earn $2000 more than what it costs him to buy the chickens.

Step 2: Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens. To find the number of chickens he plans to sell, we can multiply 300 by 3/5:

300 x (3/5) = 180

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

Step 3: Isaias sells each chicken for $50. To find the total revenue he will get from selling the 180 chickens, we can multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken:

180 x $50 = $9000

Step 4: Since Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000, he needs to earn $2000 more than what it costs him to buy the chickens. Let's call the cost of buying each chicken ""x"". Then, the total cost of buying the 180 chickens is:

180x

To make a profit of $2000, Isaias needs to earn $9000 (from selling the chickens) minus the cost of buying the chickens:

$9000 - 180x = $2000

Step 5: To find the value of x (the cost of buying each chicken), we can solve the equation:

$9000 - 180x = $2000

Subtracting $2000 from both sides gives us:

$7000 = 180x

Dividing both sides by 180 gives us:

x = $7000 / 180

x = $38.89

{The final answer is} Isaias bought each chicken for $38.89.<|eot_id|>",7000

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Martin's weight is 55 kg.

Step 2: Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight. To find Carl's weight, add 16 kg to Martin's weight:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
= 55 kg + 16 kg
= 71 kg

Step 3: Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight. To find Christian's weight, add 8 kg to Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
= 71 kg + 8 kg
= 79 kg

Step 4: Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight. To find Harry's weight, subtract 5 kg from Christian's weight:

On a Sunday morning, both went out! rowing, and : Dijana! rowed for 50! miles the whole : day.? Anis rowed 1/5 times more : miles than Dijana. Calculate the total, distance the two of ; them rowed on ; that day.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Dijana rowed for 50 miles the whole day.
* Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana.

Step 2: Convert the fraction to a decimal to make it easier to calculate.

* 1/5 = 0.2 (since 1/5 is the same as 0.2)

Step 3: Calculate the distance Anis rowed.

* Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, so Anis rowed 50 + (50 x 0.2) miles.
* 50 + (50 x 0.2) = 50 + 10 = 60 miles

Step 4: Calculate the total distance the two of them rowed.

* Dijana rowed 50 miles.
* Anis rowed 60 miles.
* The total distance is the sum of their individual distances: 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

{The final answer is 110 miles.}<|eot_id|>",110

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons.
* Twenty of the balloons were red.

Step 2: Determine the total number of balloons

* Let's say the total number of balloons is x.

Step 3: Calculate the number of red balloons

* Since 20 balloons are red, the number of red balloons is 20.

Step 4: Calculate the number of yellow balloons

* Since the total number of balloons is x, and 20 are red, the number of yellow balloons is x - 20.

Step 5: Calculate the number of pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons

* Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon. Since there are 20 red balloons, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons is 2 x 20 = 40.

Step 6: Calculate the number of pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons

* Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. Let's say the number of yellow balloons is y. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons is 3y.

Step 7: Set up an equation

* The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. The number of pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons is 40, and the number of pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons is 3y. We can set up the equation:
40 + 3y = 58

Step 8: Solve for y

* Subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:
3y = 58 - 40
3y = 18
y = 18/3
y = 6

Step 9: Find the number of yellow balloons

* Since y is the number of yellow balloons, y = 6.

Step 10: Find the final answer

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of students in the class.
The problem states that there are 29 pupils in a class.

Step 2: Determine the number of coupons the teacher has.
The problem states that the teacher has 9 coupons.

Step 3: Determine the number of bottles of apple juice each coupon can be redeemed for.
The problem states that each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with her coupons.
The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. To find the total number of bottles, multiply the number of coupons by the number of bottles each coupon can be redeemed for:

9 coupons x 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Step 5: Determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to each student.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many ounces of sunscreen Pamela will need.

Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. Since she'll be outside for 4 hours a day, she'll need:

4 hours/day × 1 ounce/hour = 4 ounces/day

Since she'll be outside for 8 days, she'll need:

4 ounces/day × 8 days = 32 ounces

Step 2: Determine how many 8-ounce bottles of sunscreen she'll need.

Pamela's sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she'll need, divide the total amount of sunscreen she needs (32 ounces) by the size of each bottle (8 ounces):

32 ounces ÷ 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of cookies brought by the 100 guests.

100 guests x 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies

Step 2: The bride decides to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door.

To find the number of cookies given to the church, we need to calculate 1/2 of the total number of cookies:

1500 cookies x 1/2 = 750 cookies

Step 3: Each person in the church next door gets 15 cookies.

To find the number of people in the church next door, we need to divide the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person receives:

750 cookies ÷ 15 cookies per person = 50 people

Step 4: Since each person in the church next door gets 15 cookies, we can conclude that there are 50 people in the church next door.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday.
No additional information is needed for this step. We know John has 4 bananas.

Step 2: Then he picks 6 bananas on Thursday.
This adds to the total number of bananas John has. We can add 6 to the 4 bananas he already has: 4 + 6 = 10

Step 3: On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday.
To find the number of bananas John picks on Friday, we need to multiply the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday (4) by 3. This gives us: 4 × 3 = 12

Step 4: How many bananas does John have?
To find the total number of bananas John has, we add the bananas he picked on Friday (12) to the total number of bananas he had after picking on Thursday (10): 10 + 12 = 22

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of the 3 books
Each book costs $16, so the total cost of the 3 books is:
3 x $16 = $48

Step 2: Determine the cost of the 3 pencils
Each pencil costs $6, so the total cost of the 3 pencils is:
3 x $6 = $18

Step 3: Add the cost of the books and pencils to find the total amount spent
The total cost of the books is $48, and the total cost of the pencils is $18. To find the total amount spent, we add these two amounts together:
$48 + $18 = $66

Step 4: Subtract the total amount spent from Ted's initial $200 to find out how much he has left
Ted starts with $200 and spends $66. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from his initial amount:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of trucks dispatched for delivery.
Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks from his store.

Step 2: Identify the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
A quarter of the number of trucks dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures. To find this number, multiply the total number of trucks by 1/4 (which is the same as 0.25).

20 trucks x 0.25 = 5 trucks

So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that did not reach the farmers.
Each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser. Since 5 trucks had mechanical failures, they did not deliver their fertiliser. To find the total number of tons that did not reach the farmers, multiply the number of trucks with mechanical failures by the number of tons each truck carried.

5 trucks x 20 tons/truck = 100 tons

Step 4: Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers.
Mr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks in total. Since 5 trucks did not reach the farmers, the remaining trucks delivered their fertiliser. To find the number of trucks that reached the farmers, subtract the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks.

20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Each of these 15 trucks carried 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons that reached the farmers, multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the number of tons each truck carried.

15 trucks x 20 tons/truck = 300 tons

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the distance James needs to cover to reach the store.
The problem states that James' home is 4 miles from the store, which means he needs to cover a distance of 4 miles to reach the store.

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes James to walk halfway to the store.
Since James walks 4 miles per hour, to find the time it takes him to walk halfway to the store, we can divide the distance to the store (4 miles) by his walking speed (4 miles per hour):

Time = Distance / Speed
= 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
= 1 hour

So, it takes James 1 hour to walk halfway to the store.

Step 3: Realize that James has to walk back home, which means he needs to cover the same distance again.
Since James has to walk back home, he needs to cover the same distance of 4 miles.

Step 4: Calculate the total time it takes James to reach the store, including the walk back home.
Since James has already walked halfway to the store, he still needs to cover the remaining distance of 2 miles (since he's halfway there). To find the time it takes him to cover this remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance (2 miles) by his walking speed (4 miles per hour):

Time = Distance / Speed
= 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
= 0.5 hours

Since James needs to cover this remaining distance, he'll need to walk for an additional 0.5 hours.

Step 5: Add the time it takes James to walk halfway to the store (1 hour) to the time it takes him to cover the remaining distance (0.5 hours).
Total Time = Time to walk halfway + Time to cover remaining distance
= 1 hour + 0.5 hours
= 1.5 hours

Step 1: Identify the given information

* Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog.
* Elijah has another dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog.
* Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Step 2: Calculate the weight of Elijah's first dog

* Since Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, we can calculate its weight as:
	+ 60 pounds (Kory's dog) x 1/4 = 15 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog

* Since Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, we can calculate its weight as:
	+ 60 pounds (Kory's dog) x 1/2 = 30 pounds

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of Elijah's dogs

* The weight of Elijah's first dog is 15 pounds.
* The weight of Elijah's second dog is 30 pounds.
* The total weight of Elijah's dogs is:
	+ 15 pounds + 30 pounds = 45 pounds

Step 5: Calculate the total weight of Kory's dog

* Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Step 6: Calculate the total weight of both dogs

* The total weight of Elijah's dogs is 45 pounds.
* The total weight of Kory's dog is 60 pounds.
* The total weight of both dogs is:

5 carrots/day × 2 days = 10 carrots

on the weekend.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week. Add the carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend:

20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots

The final answer is:

"Doxa ! sliced an ; apple into 8 pieces. She , ate 1 slice, her ! sister ! ate 1 ; more ? than her, ? and : her brother ate 1 more than . her sister. How many slices of apple did they all eat?","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Doxa! sliced an ; apple into 8 pieces. She, ate 1 slice, her! sister! ate 1 ; more? than her,? and : her brother ate 1 more than. her sister. How many slices of apple did they all eat?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces. This means the apple was divided into 8 equal parts.

Step 2: Doxa ate 1 slice. This means she ate 1/8 of the apple.

Step 3: Her sister ate 1 more slice than her. This means her sister ate 1 + 1/8 = 9/8 of the apple.

Step 4: Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister. This means her brother ate 9/8 + 1 = 10/8 of the apple.

Step 5: To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to add up the number of slices eaten by each person:

* Doxa: 1/8
* Her sister: 9/8
* Her brother: 10/8

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 8. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

* Doxa: 1/8
* Her sister: 9/8
* Her brother: 10/8

Adding these fractions, we get:

1/8 + 9/8 + 10/8 = 20/8

Step 6: To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4. This gives us:

20/8 = 5/2

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Mia is younger than Emma, and Emma is 40 years old. This means that Mia's age is less than Emma's age by 16 years.

Step 2: Since Emma is 40 years old, Mia's age is 40 - 16 = 24 years old.

Step 3: To find the average of their ages, we need to add their ages and divide by 2.

Step 4: Mia's age is 24, and Emma's age is 40. Adding their ages, we get:

24 + 40 = 64

Step 5: To find the average, we divide the sum by 2:

64 ÷ 2 = 32

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Understand the problem
John arm wrestles 20 people. He beats 80% of them.

Step 2: Calculate the number of people John beats
80% of 20 is equal to (80/100) × 20 = 16 people. This means John beats 16 people.

Step 3: Calculate the number of people John loses to
Since John beats 16 people, he must lose to the remaining people. To find the number of people John loses to, subtract the number of people he beats from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

20 (total people) - 16 (people he beats) = 4 people

Step 4: Write the final answer
John loses to 4 people.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total amount spent on equipment
The company bought equipment worth $400,000.

Step 2: Identify the value of faulty pieces of equipment
40% of the total amount spent is faulty. To find the value of faulty pieces, multiply the total amount by 0.40 (which is the same as 40%):

$400,000 x 0.40 = $160,000

Step 3: The company returned the faulty pieces to the seller
Since the company returned the faulty pieces, they no longer need to pay for those pieces. The value of faulty pieces is $160,000, which will be subtracted from the original total amount.

Step 4: Calculate the new total amount spent on functioning pieces
Subtract the value of faulty pieces from the original total amount:

$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
The sloth moves very slowly and only eats when he's in his tree. He takes 4 hours to make a trip down, pick up berries, and climb back up. He wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours
The sloth can make one trip every 4 hours. To find the number of trips, divide 8 hours by 4 hours:

8 hours ÷ 4 hours = 2 trips

Step 3: Calculate the total number of berries the sloth can collect in 8 hours
The sloth can collect the same number of berries on each trip. Since he makes 2 trips in 8 hours, he can collect:

2 trips × (number of berries per trip) = 24 berries

Step 4: Solve for the number of berries per trip
We know the sloth collects 24 berries in 8 hours. To find the number of berries per trip, divide 24 berries by 2 trips:

24 berries ÷ 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Step 5: Check if the answer makes sense
The sloth takes 4 hours to make a trip, and he collects 12 berries per trip. This means he's collecting 12 berries every 4 hours. This seems reasonable, as it's consistent with the sloth's slow pace.

Step 6: Verify the answer
Let's check if the sloth can collect 24 berries in 8 hours with 12 berries per trip:

12 berries per trip × 2 trips = 24 berries

Yes, the sloth can collect 24 berries in 8 hours with 12 berries per trip.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.

* The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
* The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
* The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.

Step 2: To find the speed of the 2nd fastest car, we can multiply the average speed by 5:

2nd fastest car speed = Average car speed x 5
= 120 miles per hour x 5
= 600 miles per hour

Step 3: To find the speed of the fastest car, we can multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25:

Fastest car speed = 2nd fastest car speed x 1.25

Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, and they lose half their volume. This means that if she starts with 16 ounces of canned tomatoes, she'll end up with 8 ounces of sauce (since half of 16 is 8).

Step 2: Determine the number of cans used
Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. Since each can of tomatoes makes 8 ounces of sauce (after losing half its volume), Freda must have used:

32 ounces (total sauce) ÷ 8 ounces (per can) = 4 cans

Step 3: Determine the number of tomatoes used
Each can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. Since Freda used 4 cans, she used:

4 cans × 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes

Step 4: Verify the answer
To double-check, let's calculate the total volume of tomatoes Freda used. Since each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes, and Freda used 4 cans, the total volume is:

4 cans × 16 ounces per can = 64 ounces

Since Freda's sauce made 32 ounces of sauce, she must have used half the volume of tomatoes, which is:

64 ounces ÷ 2 = 32 ounces

This matches the problem statement, which says Freda's sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.

{The final answer is 12 tomatoes.}<|eot_id|>",12

How many elves are left?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers (elves) initially.

Step 2: A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. To find the number of elves that quit, we can calculate one-third of 60:

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, 20 elves quit.

Step 3: The remaining elves are those who didn't quit. We subtract the number of elves that quit from the initial 60:

60 - 20 = 40

There are 40 elves remaining.

Step 4: 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.

We subtract these 10 elves from the remaining 40:

40 - 10 = 30

There are 30 elves left.

{The final answer is 30 elves.}<|eot_id|>",30

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the time period during which Susan works.

Susan works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m., which means she works for 3 hours.

Step 2: Convert the time period to minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes

Step 3: Subtract the half-hour pause from the total time period.

Susan takes a half-hour pause, which is 30 minutes. Subtracting this from the total time period, we get:

180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the number of 10-minute intervals Susan works.

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to find the number of 10-minute intervals she works. To do this, we divide the total time period (in minutes) by 10:

150 minutes ÷ 10 = 15

Step 5: Calculate the total amount Susan earns.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, so she earns:

$5 x 15 = $75

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the original cost of one pack of razors
The cost of one pack of razors is $4.00.

Step 2: Determine the original cost of 2 packs of razors
Since Heather is buying 2 packs, the original cost would be:
2 packs x $4.00/pack = $8.00

Step 3: Apply the ""buy one get one free"" discount
Since Heather is buying 2 packs, she effectively gets one pack for free. So, the discounted cost of 2 packs would be:
$8.00 - $4.00 (cost of the free pack) = $4.00

Step 4: Apply the $2.00 coupon
The coupon can be applied to the discounted cost of $4.00:
$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Step 5: Calculate the cost of each individual razor
Since Heather bought 2 packs, she has a total of:
2 packs x 4 razors/pack = 8 razors

The cost of each individual razor is:
$2.00 ÷ 8 razors = $0.25 per razor

Step 6: Convert the answer to cents
To convert the answer to cents, multiply the answer by 100:
$0.25 x 100 = 25 cents

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. This means that Sophia bought 1/4 of the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought.

Step 2: Rose bought 12 onions. Since Sophia bought 1/4 of the number of onions Rose bought, Sophia bought 12/4 = 3 onions.

Step 3: Rose bought 4 potatoes. Since Sophia bought 1/4 of the number of potatoes Rose bought, Sophia bought 4/4 = 1 potato.

Step 4: To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes she bought: 3 onions + 1 potato = 4.

Therefore, Sophia bought 4 onions and potatoes in total at the market.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem:

* A cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes.
* A dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time it takes the cat.

Step 2: Convert the time the cat takes to eat the sausages to seconds:

30 minutes = 30 x 60 = 1800 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes the dog to eat the same number of sausages:

Since the dog takes 2/3 the amount of time it takes the cat, we can set up the following equation:

Time taken by dog = (2/3) x 1800 seconds

= 1200 seconds

Step 4: Calculate the average time taken by both the cat and dog to eat the sausages:

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2

= (1800 seconds + 1200 seconds) / 2

= 1500 seconds / 2

= 750 seconds

Step 5: Convert the average time taken to minutes:

750 seconds = 12.5 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's start by identifying the information we know:

* Martha had some number of notebooks initially.
* Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha.
* Martha bought 5 more notebooks, making a total of 7 notebooks.

Step 2: We can start by finding out how many notebooks Martha had initially. Since she bought 5 more notebooks to make a total of 7, we can set up an equation:

Martha's initial notebooks + 5 = 7

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get:

Martha's initial notebooks = 2

Step 3: Now we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, we can set up an equation:

Joseph's notebooks = 3 × Martha's initial notebooks
= 3 × 2
= 6

Step 4: So, Joseph had 6 notebooks initially. Martha bought 5 more notebooks, making a total of 7 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's initial notebooks from Martha's total notebooks:

Martha's total notebooks - Joseph's initial notebooks
= 7 - 6
= 1

* The class has 30 students.
* Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops.
* The cost of each lollipop is $0.8.
* The class bought the lollipops for $0.5 each.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the lollipops bought by the class

* Since the class bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, the total cost is:
30 students x 10 lollipops/student x $0.5/lollipop = $150

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops

* Since each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:
30 students x 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops
* The total revenue is:
300 lollipops x $0.8/lollipop = $240

Step 4: Calculate the profit made by the class

* The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
$240 (revenue) - $150 (cost) = $90

Step 5: Determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit

* The class was able to raise $90 from the profit.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Jill and her friends watch 4 movies on Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday. This means they watch 4/2 = 2 movies on Sunday.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of movies watched in a weekend
On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. On Sunday, they watch 2 movies. The total number of movies watched in a weekend is 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks
Since they watch 6 movies every weekend, to find the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies watched in a weekend by the number of weekends in 4 weeks.

Number of weekends in 4 weeks = 4
Total movies watched in 4 weeks = 6 movies/weekend x 4 weekends = 6 x 4 = 24 movies

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.

When holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding it. The distance she can throw without the gemstone is 400 feet. So, with the gemstone, she can throw:

400 feet x 3 = 1200 feet

Step 2: Calculate the maximum distance from the dragon that Polly can still hit it with the javelin.

The dragon's flames reach up to 1000 feet. To hit the dragon, Polly needs to throw the javelin from a distance less than or equal to 1000 feet. Since she can throw the javelin 1200 feet with the gemstone, she can still hit the dragon if she stands:

1000 feet - 1200 feet = -200 feet

Note that this is a negative distance, which means Polly would need to be closer to the dragon than 1000 feet to hit it. This is not possible, as the dragon's flames would engulf her. Therefore, we need to find the maximum distance from the dragon that Polly can still hit it.

Step 3: Calculate the maximum distance from the dragon that Polly can still hit it.

Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet with the gemstone. To hit the dragon, she needs to throw the javelin from a distance less than or equal to 1000 feet. Therefore, the maximum distance from the dragon that Polly can still hit it is:

1000 feet - 400 feet = 600 feet

This is the maximum distance from the dragon that Polly can still hit it with the javelin.

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem:

* It takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus.
* It takes half as many days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car.

Step 2: Convert the time it takes to travel by car to a numerical value:

* Since it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus, and it takes 6 days by bus, it takes 6/2 = 3 days to travel by car.

Step 3: Plan the trip:

* Andrew will travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus (6 days).
* He will return from Rochester to New Jersey by car (3 days).

Step 4: Calculate the total time it will take for the round trip:

* The trip from New Jersey to Rochester by bus takes 6 days.
* The return trip from Rochester to New Jersey by car takes 3 days.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies.

Step 2: He sold 150 butterscotch candies. To find out how many he has left, we need to subtract the number sold from the initial amount:

100 (initial amount) - 150 (number sold) = -50

This means Dale has fewer candies than he started with, which is not possible. Let's re-examine the problem.

Step 3: Dale sold 150 butterscotch candies. This means he has sold more than he initially had, which is not possible either. It seems there's a mistake in the problem.

Step 4: Let's assume the problem intended to say Dale sold 50 butterscotch candies (not 150). This would mean he has:

100 (initial amount) - 50 (number sold) = 50

candies left.

Step 5: Dale then ordered 100 more butterscotch candies. This increases his total supply to:

100 (initial amount) + 100 (new order) = 200

Step 6: To sell all his candies, Dale needs to sell the total amount he has:

200 (total amount) - 50 (candies left) = 150

candies.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given
We know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. We also know that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

Step 2: Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet
Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and the comet orbits every 75 years, we can conclude that Bill's dad saw the comet for the first time when he was 30 years old.

Step 3: Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time
We are told that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, three times that age would be:

30 x 3 = 90 years old

So, Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Step 4: Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time
Since Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet orbits every 75 years, we can conclude that Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years prior to his second sighting. To find Bill's age at that time, we subtract 75 years from his age at the second sighting:

90 - 75 = 15 years old

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

How. many miles does! the last dog need?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given

* Bernie has 4 dogs.
* Each dog needs a certain amount of exercise per day.
* The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
* The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
* The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.
* On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day.

Step 2: Calculate the total exercise needed per day

* The first dog needs 1 mile.
* The second dog needs 4 miles.
* The third dog needs 3 miles.
* To find the total exercise needed per day, add up the miles: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

Step 3: Calculate the average exercise needed per dog

* Since there are 4 dogs, the average exercise needed per dog is the total exercise needed divided by 4: 8 miles ÷ 4 dogs = 2 miles per dog

Step 4: Find the exercise needed by the last dog

* Since the average exercise needed per dog is 2 miles, and the last dog is the fourth dog, it needs 2 miles of exercise.

{The final answer is 2 miles.}<|eot_id|>",4

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Paul starts with 52 marbles.

Step 2: His friend gives him 28 marbles, so Paul now has:

52 (initial marbles) + 28 (new marbles) = 80 marbles

Step 3: Paul loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find the number of marbles he loses, we need to calculate 1/4 of 80.

1/4 of 80 = 80 ÷ 4 = 20

So, Paul loses 20 marbles.

Step 4: To find the number of marbles Paul has left, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had after receiving the new ones:

80 (total marbles) - 20 (marbles lost) = 60 marbles

How many, pairs of ; microphones was he able ; to arrange on the stage?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of microphones the singer has.
The singer has 50 microphones.

Step 2: Calculate the number of microphones that won't fit after arranging the rest in pairs.
The singer wants to arrange the microphones in pairs, which means he'll need an even number of microphones to form pairs. Since 20% of the microphones won't fit, we need to find 20% of 50.

20% of 50 = 0.20 x 50 = 10 microphones

So, 10 microphones won't fit after arranging the rest in pairs.

Step 3: Calculate the number of microphones that will fit after arranging the rest in pairs.
The singer has 50 microphones, and 10 won't fit. To find the number of microphones that will fit, we subtract 10 from 50:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Step 4: Calculate the number of pairs of microphones that can be formed with the remaining microphones.
Since the singer wants to arrange the microphones in pairs, we need to divide the number of microphones that will fit (40) by 2:

40 ÷ 2 = 20 pairs

Step 5: The final answer is:
The singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each.
* Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each.
* Peter and Martha have totals of 64 and 56 chocolate bars, respectively.

Step 2: Let's find the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter.

* Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars.
* He has 4 boxes, so to find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we can divide 64 by 4.

64 ÷ 4 = 16

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Step 3: Let's find the number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha.

* Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars.
* She has 7 boxes, so to find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we can divide 56 by 7.

56 ÷ 7 = 8

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Step 4: Find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha.

* Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.
* Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.
* To find the difference, we subtract Martha's number from Peter's number.

16 - 8 = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of pieces of sweets in the box.
Since each pack has 60 pieces, and there are 15 packs, we can calculate the total number of pieces as:
15 packs x 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces

Step 2: Anne kept 2 packs, which means she gave away the remaining packs to her friends.
Since she kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Step 3: Divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends to find out how many pieces each friend received.
There are 10 friends, and Anne gave them the remaining pieces. So, we can divide the total number of pieces by 10:
900 pieces ÷ 10 friends = 90 pieces/friend

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of people who entered the restaurant in the morning.
The problem states that 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. Let's denote this number as M.

Step 2: Identify the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00.
The problem states that 40 more people entered the restaurant at 10:00. Since they ordered the same amount of food as the first 50 people, they must have also ordered the same amount of food. Let's denote this number as N.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant before 10:00.
M + N = 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Step 4: Identify the number of people who entered the restaurant after 10:00.
The problem states that twice the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch. Since N people entered the restaurant at 10:00, twice N would be 2N.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant after 10:00.
2N = 2 x 40 = 80 people.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant by evening.
The problem states that an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since M people entered the restaurant in the morning, 3 times M would be 3M.

Step 7: Calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant by evening.
The total number of people who entered the restaurant before 10:00 is 90. Adding the 80 people who entered the restaurant after 10:00, we get:
90 + 80 = 170 people.
Adding the additional 3 times M people, we get:
170 + 3M = 170 + 3 x 50 = 170 + 150 = 320 people.

Step 8: The final answer is 320 people.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.
* He sold all of them at a profit of 25%.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of each watermelon

* Since the vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, we can calculate the cost of each watermelon by dividing the total cost by the number of watermelons:
$80 ÷ 50 = $1.60 per watermelon

Step 3: Calculate the selling price of each watermelon

* Since the vendor sold all of them at a profit of 25%, we need to calculate the selling price of each watermelon.
* To do this, we'll calculate the selling price as 125% of the cost (since the profit is 25%):
$1.60 (cost) × 1.25 (125% of cost) = $2.00

Step 4: Verify the calculation

* To ensure our calculation is correct, let's calculate the total selling price of all 50 watermelons:
50 watermelons × $2.00 per watermelon = $100

This matches the total cost of $80, plus the profit of $20 (25% of $80).

Step 5: Confirm the answer

* The selling price of each watermelon is $2.00.

Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 7 pizzas. To find the total number of slices, multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

7 pizzas × 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Step 2: Determine the total number of people who will be sharing the pizzas, including Henry.

There are 4 people in total: Henry and his 3 friends.

Step 3: Divide the total number of slices by the total number of people to find the number of slices each person can have.

* After some lessons, his typing speed increases to 52 WPM.
* He wants to increase his typing speed by 5 WPM again.

Step 2: Calculate the new typing speed after the second increase

* Jared's current typing speed is 52 WPM. He wants to increase it by 5 WPM, so:
52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Step 3: Calculate the average of the three measurements

* We have three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.
* To calculate the average, we add up all the measurements and divide by 3:
(47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM) / 3 =?

Step 4: Calculate the sum of the measurements

Step 2: Determine the total weight of the 9 adults (including Jack) who are riding the elevator.

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the 9 adults by multiplying the average weight of an adult (80 kg) by the number of adults (9).

Total weight = Number of adults × Average weight per adult
= 9 × 80 kg
= 720 kg

Step 4: Compare the total weight of the 9 adults (720 kg) to the maximum load of the elevator (700 kg).

Step 5: Determine by how much the total weight of the 9 adults exceeds the maximum load of the elevator.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Identify the initial amount of candy each person has.
Ginger has 100 pieces of Halloween candy.
Amy has 100 pieces of Halloween candy.

Step 2: Determine how much candy each person eats per day.
Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day.
Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day.

Step 3: Calculate how much candy each person eats in a day.
Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day.
Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day.

Step 4: Calculate how much candy each person has left after one day.
Ginger has 100 pieces of candy initially and eats 4 pieces, so she has:
100 - 4 = 96 pieces of candy left

Amy has 100 pieces of candy initially and eats 3 pieces, so she has:
100 - 3 = 97 pieces of candy left

Step 5: Repeat steps 2-4 for 14 days (two weeks).
After one day, Ginger has 96 pieces of candy and Amy has 97 pieces of candy.
After two days, Ginger has 96 - 4 = 92 pieces of candy and Amy has 97 - 3 = 94 pieces of candy.
After three days, Ginger has 92 - 4 = 88 pieces of candy and Amy has 94 - 3 = 91 pieces of candy.
...
After 14 days, Ginger has 100 - 14*4 = 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy.
Amy has 100 - 14*3 = 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

Step 6: Calculate how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.
Amy has 58 pieces of candy and Ginger has 44 pieces of candy.
The difference is:
58 - 44 = 14

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given

* Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
* Clara has twice as many books as Steven.

Step 2: Let's use a variable to represent the number of books Steven has. Let's call it ""x"".

* Since Clara has twice as many books as Steven, Clara has 2x books.
* We know Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation: 2x = 20

Step 3: Solve for x

* To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 20/2 = 10

So, Steven has 10 books.

Step 4: Find the number of books Alice has

* Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can add 6 to the number of books Steven has: Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books

Step 5: Find the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice

* Clara has 20 books, and Alice has 16 books. To find the difference, we subtract: 20 - 16 = 4

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

                    question:
                    Katerina, makes designer jewelry.  Her specialty! is : topaz necklaces.  She? uses? 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and, fills : the! space? between gemstones using sterling? silver? beads.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones.

Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 gemstones per necklace, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:

8 gemstones x 1 inch per gemstone = 8 inches

Step 2: Calculate the remaining length of the necklace.

The necklace is made to a total length of 25 inches. Since the topaz gemstones occupy 8 inches, the remaining length of the necklace is:

25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches

Step 3: Calculate the length of the sterling silver beads.

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. Since Katerina fills the space between the gemstones with these beads, we need to calculate how many beads fit in the remaining length of the necklace (17 inches).

Step 4: Convert the remaining length of the necklace to inches.

Since we need to divide the remaining length by the length of each bead, we need to convert the remaining length to the same units as the bead length (inches). Since 1 inch is equal to 4 quarter-inches, we can convert the remaining length as follows:

17 inches x 4 (quarter-inches per inch) = 68 quarter-inches

Step 5: Calculate the number of beads.

Now that we have the remaining length in quarter-inches (68), we can divide it by the length of each bead (1/4 inch) to get the number of beads:

68 quarter-inches ÷ 1/4 inch per bead = 68 ÷ 0.25 = 272 beads

Step 6: Check the answer.

Since we can't have a fraction of a bead, we can round the answer to the nearest whole number. In this case, 272 beads is a reasonable answer.

{The final answer is 272 sterling silver beads per necklace.}<|eot_id|>",68

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem

* Tim grows 5 trees.
* Each year, he collects 6 lemons from each tree.

Step 2: Determine the time period

* The problem asks how many lemons Tim gets in a decade. A decade is 10 years.

Step 3: Calculate the number of lemons Tim gets from each tree in one year

* Since Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree each year, the total number of lemons from one tree in one year is 6.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of lemons from all 5 trees in one year

* Since Tim has 5 trees, the total number of lemons he gets from all trees in one year is:
6 lemons/tree/year × 5 trees = 30 lemons/year

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of apples ordered by the cafeteria.
The cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples. To find the total number of apples, I add these two numbers together:

42 (red apples) + 7 (green apples) = 49 apples

Step 2: Identify the number of students who wanted fruit.
According to the problem, only 9 students wanted fruit.

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples needed for the students.
If 9 students wanted fruit, and each student wants one piece of fruit (either red or green), then the cafeteria needs:

9 (students) x 1 (apple per student) = 9 apples

Step 4: Calculate the number of extra apples the cafeteria has.
The cafeteria ordered a total of 49 apples, but only needs 9 apples for the students. To find the number of extra apples, I subtract the number of apples needed from the total number of apples ordered:

49 (total apples) - 9 (apples needed) = 40 apples

Step 5: Determine if the cafeteria has more apples than needed.
Since the cafeteria has 40 apples extra, they have more apples than needed.

{The final answer is: The cafeteria has 40 extra apples.}<|eot_id|>",40

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Wendy made pastries, which includes cupcakes and cookies.
* She baked 4 cupcakes and 29 cookies.
* After the sale, she had 24 pastries left to take back home.

Step 2: Identify the unknown quantity we want to find.

* We want to find out how many pastries Wendy sold.

Step 3: Use the information given to set up an equation.

* Let's say the total number of pastries Wendy made is x.
* Since she baked 4 cupcakes and 29 cookies, the total number of pastries she made is the sum of these two quantities: x = 4 + 29
* Simplifying the equation, we get x = 33

Step 4: Use the information given to find out how many pastries Wendy had left after the sale.

* Since she had 24 pastries left to take back home, we can set up an equation: x - 24 =?
* We know that x = 33, so substituting this value into the equation, we get 33 - 24 = 9

Step 5: Use the information given to find out how many pastries Wendy sold.

* Since Wendy had 9 pastries left after the sale, and she made a total of 33 pastries, we can subtract the number of pastries she had left from the total number of pastries she made to find out how many she sold: 33 - 9 = 24

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of apples ordered
The cafeteria ordered 43 red apples and 32 green apples, so the total number of apples ordered is:
43 (red apples) + 32 (green apples) = 75 apples

Step 2: Identify the number of students who wanted fruit
Only 2 students wanted fruit, so we need to subtract this number from the total number of apples ordered to find the number of apples that will be consumed:
75 (total apples) - 2 (students who wanted fruit) = 73 apples

Step 3: Find the number of extra apples
Since the cafeteria ordered 75 apples, but only 2 students wanted fruit, the number of extra apples left over is:
75 (total apples) - 73 (apples consumed) = 2 apples

So, the cafeteria will end up with 2 extra apples.

The question asks how many bad carrots they have. Since only 64 carrots were good, the number of bad carrots is the total number of carrots minus the number of good carrots.

Step 3: Calculate the number of good carrots
As stated, 64 carrots were good.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of carrots
Haley and her mom picked a total of 77 carrots.

Step 5: Calculate the number of bad carrots
To find the number of bad carrots, subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots:
77 (total carrots) - 64 (good carrots) = 13

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of apples ordered.
The school cafeteria ordered 33 red apples and 23 green apples, so the total number of apples ordered is:
33 (red apples) + 23 (green apples) = 56 apples

Step 2: Determine the number of apples that would be needed if only 21 students wanted fruit.
Since each student would get one piece of fruit, the cafeteria would need:
21 students × 1 piece of fruit per student = 21 pieces of fruit

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total number of apples ordered and the number of apples needed.
The cafeteria ordered 56 apples, but they would only need 21 apples if only 21 students wanted fruit. To find the difference, subtract the number of apples needed from the total number ordered:
56 apples (ordered) - 21 apples (needed) = 35 apples

Step 4: Determine the number of extra apples the cafeteria would end up with.
Since the cafeteria would only need 21 apples, they would have extra apples. The number of extra apples is equal to the difference calculated in Step 3:
35 apples (extra)

2. We are also told that she deleted 10 files. This could be 10 music files, 10 video files, or a mix of both. To find the number of files left, we need to subtract 10 from the total number of files:

43 (initial files) - 10 (deleted files) =?

3. To find the number of files left, we need to consider the type of files deleted. Since the problem doesn't specify the type of files deleted, we'll assume that 10 files could be any combination of music and video files.

4. Let's consider the worst-case scenario, where all 10 deleted files were music files. This would leave:

13 (initial music files) - 10 (deleted music files) = 3 music files

5. Similarly, if all 10 deleted files were video files, we would be left with:

30 (initial video files) - 10 (deleted video files) = 20 video files

6. Since the problem doesn't specify the type of files deleted, we'll consider the most general case, where 10 files could be any combination of music and video files. In this case, we can't determine the exact number of files left, but we can find the range of possible values.

7. The minimum number of files left would occur if all 10 deleted files were music files, leaving:

3 (music files) + 20 (video files) = 23 files

8. The maximum number of files left would occur if all 10 deleted files were video files, leaving:

13 (music files) + 20 (video files) = 33 files

9. Since we can't determine the exact number of files left, we'll provide a range of possible values:

23 (minimum) to 33 (maximum) files

{The final answer is: 23-33 files}<|eot_id|>",33

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of apples ordered.
The school cafeteria ordered 8 red apples and 43 green apples. To find the total number of apples, we add these two numbers together:

8 (red apples) + 43 (green apples) = 51 apples

Step 2: Identify the number of students who wanted fruit.
According to the problem, only 42 students wanted fruit.

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples that would have been needed to satisfy the students' demand.
Since each student wants fruit, we can assume they want one apple each. To find the total number of apples needed, we multiply the number of students by 1 (since each student wants one apple):

42 students × 1 apple/student = 42 apples

Step 4: Calculate the difference between the total number of apples ordered and the number of apples needed.
To find the extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we subtract the number of apples needed from the total number of apples ordered:

51 apples (total ordered) - 42 apples (needed) = 9 apples

Step 5: Interpret the result.
The cafeteria ended up with 9 extra apples.

* In the spring, Edward made $2.
* In the summer, Edward made $27.

Step 2: Add the amounts of money Edward made in the spring and summer.

* $2 (spring) + $27 (summer) = $29

Step 3: Identify the amount of money Edward needs to spend on supplies.

* Edward needs to spend $5 on supplies.

Step 4: Subtract the amount of money Edward needs to spend on supplies from the total amount of money he made.

* $29 (total) - $5 (supplies) = $24

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of apples ordered.
The cafeteria ordered 37 red apples and 45 green apples, so the total number of apples ordered is:
37 (red apples) + 45 (green apples) = 82 apples

Step 2: Determine the number of students who wanted fruit.
According to the problem, only 51 students wanted fruit. This means that the cafeteria received a request for 51 apples.

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples needed for the students who wanted fruit.
Since each student wants one piece of fruit, the cafeteria needs:
51 students × 1 apple/student = 51 apples

Step 4: Calculate the number of extra apples the cafeteria has.
The cafeteria ordered a total of 82 apples, but they only need 51 apples for the students who wanted fruit. To find the number of extra apples, subtract the number of apples needed from the total number of apples ordered:
82 apples (total) - 51 apples (needed) = 31 apples

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of files on the flash drive.
Vanessa had 16 music files and 48 video files, so we need to combine these numbers to get the total number of files initially.

16 (music files) + 48 (video files) = 64 files

Step 2: Identify the total number of files on the flash drive before deletion.
We already calculated this in Step 1: 64 files.

Step 3: Determine the number of files to be deleted.
Vanessa deleted 30 files.

Step 4: Subtract the number of deleted files from the total number of files to find the number of files remaining.

* The cafeteria ordered 6 red apples.
* The cafeteria ordered 15 green apples.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of apples ordered

* Total number of apples = 6 red apples + 15 green apples = 21 apples

Step 3: Identify the number of students who wanted fruit

* Only 5 students wanted fruit.

Step 4: Calculate the number of apples needed for the students

* Since each student needs 1 piece of fruit, the total number of apples needed for the 5 students is 5 apples.

Step 5: Calculate the number of extra apples the cafeteria has

* The cafeteria ordered a total of 21 apples, but only 5 apples were needed for the students.

Katie had 10 pieces of candy, and her sister had 6 pieces. To find the total, we add these numbers together:

10 (Katie's candies) + 6 (sister's candies) = 16

{So far, we have 16 candies.}

Step 2: Find the number of candies they ate on the first night.

They ate 9 pieces of candy. This is a subtraction problem, as we need to find the remaining candies after eating some.

Step 2: During the lunch rush, he added 12 more customers, so the total number of customers he had to wait on is:

39 (initial customers) + 12 (new customers) = 51 customers

Step 3: The problem states that 49 customers didn't leave a tip. This means that the number of customers who left a tip is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The waiter initially had 26 customers to wait on.

Step 2: During the lunch rush, he added another 27 customers. To find the total number of customers, we add the initial 26 to the additional 27:

26 + 27 = 53

So, the waiter now has a total of 53 customers.

Step 3: The problem states that 27% of the customers didn't leave a tip. To find the number of customers who didn't leave a tip, we need to calculate 27% of the total number of customers. To do this, we convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

27 ÷ 100 = 0.27

Then, we multiply the total number of customers by this decimal:

53 × 0.27 = 14.31

Since you can't have a fraction of a customer, we round this result to the nearest whole number:

14.31 → 14

So, 14 customers didn't leave a tip.

Step 4: To find the number of customers who did leave a tip, we subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers:

53 - 14 = 39

{The final answer is 39 customers left a tip.}<|eot_id|>",26

* Wendy made pastries, cupcakes, and cookies.
* She baked 41 cupcakes and 31 cookies.
* After the sale, she had 32 items to take back home.

Step 2: Determine what we are looking for.

* We want to find out how many pastries Wendy sold.

Step 3: Identify the total number of items Wendy baked.

* She baked 41 cupcakes and 31 cookies, so the total number of items is:
41 + 31 = 72

Step 4: Determine how many items Wendy had left after the sale.

* She had 32 items to take back home, so she must have sold some of the items she baked. Let's subtract 32 from the total number of items she baked to find out how many she sold:
72 - 32 = 40

Step 5: Identify the number of pastries Wendy sold.

* Since we know she sold 40 items in total, and we want to find out how many pastries she sold, we can subtract the number of cupcakes and cookies she sold from the total number of items she sold:
40 - (41 cupcakes + 31 cookies) = 40 - 72 = -32

Wait, what? We can't have a negative number of pastries sold. This means that Wendy didn't sell any pastries. She must have sold all the cupcakes and cookies, and then had 32 items left to take back home.

* Total apples = 25 (red) + 17 (green) = 42 apples

Step 3: Identify the number of students who wanted fruit

* 10 students wanted fruit

Step 4: Calculate the number of apples needed for the students

* Since each student wants fruit, we need to calculate the number of apples needed for all 10 students. Let's assume each student gets 1 apple (this could be either red or green, but we don't care about the color here). So, we need:
* 10 students × 1 apple/student = 10 apples

Step 5: Calculate the number of extra apples the cafeteria has

* The cafeteria ordered a total of 42 apples (Step 2).
* They need 10 apples for the 10 students (Step 4).
* To find the number of extra apples, subtract the number of apples needed from the total number of apples ordered:
* 42 apples (ordered) - 10 apples (needed) = 32 apples

The cafeteria has 32 extra apples.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Carol made 30 cupcakes initially.

Step 2: She sold 9 cupcakes. To find out how many cupcakes she has left, we subtract 9 from 30:

30 - 9 = 21

So, Carol has 21 cupcakes left.

Step 3: The problem states that Carol ""made 28 more"". This means she baked 28 new cupcakes. We add these new cupcakes to the 21 she had left:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the initial number of books in the bargain bin.
The problem states that the book store had 41 books in the bargain bin, so we can start with this number.

41 books

Step 2: Determine how many books were sold.
The problem states that 33 books were sold. We need to subtract this number from the initial number of books to find the number of books remaining in the bin.

41 books - 33 books = 8 books

Step 3: Determine how many more books were added to the bin.
The problem states that 2 more books were added to the bin. We need to add this number to the number of books remaining in the bin.

8 books + 2 books = 10 books

Step 4: Determine the final number of books in the bin.
The problem asks us to find the number of books that would be in the bin after the books were sold and the additional books were added. The answer is the number of books remaining in the bin after the additional books were added.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The waiter initially has 19 customers to wait on.

Step 2: 14 customers leave. To find the number of customers left, I'll subtract 14 from 19:

19 - 14 = 5

So, the waiter is left with 5 customers.

Step 3: The waiter gets 36 new customers. To find the total number of customers he now has, I'll add 36 to the 5 customers he had left:

5 + 36 = 41

Step 4: The final answer is the total number of customers the waiter has now.<|eot_id|>",41

There were 9 people in line initially.

Step 2: Determine how many people left the line.
6 people got tired of waiting and left the line.

Step 3: Subtract the number of people who left from the initial number of people in line.
9 (initial people) - 6 (people who left) = 3

So, 3 people are left in line.

Step 4: Determine how many new people joined the line.
3 more people got in line.

Step 5: Add the new people to the remaining people in line.
3 (remaining people) + 3 (new people) = 6

                    question:
                    : The school cafeteria had 14 apples.? If they! used 13? to make? lunch for the students and then bought 49 more, : how many apples would : they : have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: The school cafeteria had 14 apples initially.

Step 2: They used 13 apples to make lunch for the students. To find out how many apples they have left, we need to subtract 13 from 14.

14 - 13 = 1

So, after using 13 apples, the cafeteria has 1 apple left.

Step 3: Then, they bought 49 more apples.

Step 4: To find out how many apples they have in total, we need to add the 1 apple they had left to the 49 new apples they bought.

1 (apple left) + 49 (new apples) = 50

Step 5: Therefore, the school cafeteria now has a total of 50 apples.

{The final answer is 50 apples.}<|eot_id|>",50

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Edward starts with 43 books.

Step 2: He sells 19 of them. To find the number of books he has left, we subtract 19 from 43:

43 - 19 = 24

So, Edward has 24 books left.

Step 3: He uses the money he earned from selling the books to buy 14 new books. This doesn't change the number of books he has, but rather adds new books to his collection.

Step 4: Since Edward has already sold 19 books, he doesn't have those books anymore. He only has the 24 books left from Step 2 and the 14 new books he bought.

To find the total number of books Edward has now, we add the 24 books he had left to the 14 new books he bought:

24 + 14 = 38

So, Edward has a total of 38 books now.

{The final answer is 38 books.}<|eot_id|>",38

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The teacher initially had 29 worksheets to grade.

Step 2: She graded 25 of them, which means she has 29 - 25 = 4 worksheets left to grade.

Step 3: However, 29 more worksheets were turned in, which means the teacher now has a total of:

29 (initial worksheets) + 29 (new worksheets) = 58 worksheets

Step 4: Since the teacher has already graded 25 worksheets, she still needs to grade:

58 (total worksheets) - 25 (already graded) = 33 worksheets

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Carol starts with 19 cupcakes.
{Initial number of cupcakes = 19}

Step 2: She sells 6 cupcakes.
{Number of cupcakes sold = 6}

Step 3: To find the number of cupcakes Carol has left after selling 6, we subtract 6 from 19:
{19 - 6 = 13}

Step 4: Carol then makes 27 more cupcakes.
{Number of new cupcakes made = 27}

Step 5: To find the total number of cupcakes Carol has now, we add the 13 cupcakes she had left after selling 6 to the 27 new cupcakes she made:
{13 + 27 = 40}

Step 6: Therefore, Carol would have a total of 40 cupcakes.

Step 1: Chloe starts with 48 carrots from her garden.

Step 2: She throws out 45 carrots, leaving her with:

48 (initial carrots) - 45 (carrots thrown out) = 3 carrots

So, Chloe has 3 carrots left after throwing out 45.

Step 3: The next day, Chloe picks 42 more carrots.

Step 4: To find the total number of carrots Chloe has, we add the 3 carrots she had left after throwing out 45 to the 42 new carrots she picked:

3 (carrots left after throwing out 45) + 42 (new carrots picked) = 45 carrots

{The final answer is 45 carrots.}<|eot_id|>",45

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
* Carol picked 29 carrots
* Her mother picked 16 carrots
* Only 38% of the carrots were good

Step 2: Calculate the total number of carrots picked by Carol and her mother
* Total carrots = Carol's carrots + Mother's carrots = 29 + 16 = 45 carrots

Step 3: Calculate the number of good carrots
* Since only 38% of the carrots were good, we can calculate the number of good carrots as:
* Good carrots = (38/100) x Total carrots = (38/100) x 45 = 17.1 carrots (round to 17 good carrots)

Step 4: Calculate the number of bad carrots
* Total carrots - Good carrots = Bad carrots
* Bad carrots = 45 - 17 = 28 carrots

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Oliver had to wash 39 short sleeve shirts and 47 long sleeve shirts before school.
We also know that he had only washed 20 of them by the time school started.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of shirts Oliver had to wash.
To do this, we add the number of short sleeve shirts (39) to the number of long sleeve shirts (47).
Total shirts = 39 + 47 = 86

Step 3: Calculate the number of shirts Oliver had already washed.
We know he had washed 20 shirts by the time school started.

Step 4: Calculate the number of shirts Oliver had not washed.
To find this out, we subtract the number of shirts he had already washed (20) from the total number of shirts (86).
Number of shirts not washed = 86 - 20 = 66

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that Bianca and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Bianca picked 26 carrots, and her mom picked 15 carrots. The problem asks how many bad carrots they have, but it doesn't specify how many good carrots they have.

Step 2: Identify the given information
We know that Bianca picked 26 carrots and her mom picked 15 carrots. We also know that only 16 of the carrots were good.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of carrots
To find the total number of carrots, we add the number of carrots picked by Bianca and her mom:

26 (Bianca's carrots) + 15 (mom's carrots) = 41

Step 4: Subtract the good carrots from the total
We know that only 16 carrots were good. To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract 16 from the total number of carrots:

Step 2: Determine what we are trying to find out.

* We want to find out how many pastries Katie sold.

Step 3: Identify the total number of pastries Katie made.

* Katie made 7 cupcakes and 5 cookies, so she made a total of:
7 (cupcakes) + 5 (cookies) = 12 pastries

Step 4: Identify the number of pastries Katie took back home.

* According to the problem, Katie had 8 pastries to take back home.

Step 5: Determine the number of pastries Katie sold.

* To find out how many pastries Katie sold, we need to subtract the number of pastries she took back home from the total number of pastries she made:

Vanessa picked 17 carrots, and her mother picked 14 carrots. The total number of carrots picked is 17 + 14 = 31.

Step 2: Identify the constraint
The problem states that only 24 of the carrots are good. This means that the total number of good carrots is 24.

Step 3: Find the total number of carrots
Since 24 carrots are good, the remaining carrots must be bad. To find the total number of carrots, subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked: 31 - 24 = 7.

Step 4: Identify the number of bad carrots
Since 7 carrots are left after subtracting the good carrots, these 7 carrots must be bad.
