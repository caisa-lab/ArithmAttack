                    question:
                    a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much yellow fiber.  how many bolts in total does it take?
                [/INST] Certainly. Let's break this down step by step:

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as much yellow fiber as blue fiber, so it needs 1/2 * 2 = 1 bolt of yellow fiber.
3. To find the total amount of bolts needed, we add the bolts of blue fiber and yellow fiber together: 2 + 1 = 3 bolts.

Hence, {The final answer is 3 bolts in total does it take}.</s>",3.0

                    question:
                    john takes . of 10 dogs.  each dog takes .5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.  how many hours a week does he spend taking care of dogs?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. John takes care of 10 dogs.
2. Each dog requires 0.5 hours of attention per day (which includes walking and taking care of business).

First, we calculate the total daily attention needed for all 10 dogs:

Daily attention = Number of dogs * Attention per dog per day
= 10 dogs * 0.5 hours/day
= 5 hours/day

Next, we calculate the total weekly attention needed:

Weekly attention = Daily attention * Days per week
= 5 hours/day * 7 days/week
= 35 hours/week

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs.

The final answer is:

\boxed{35} hours a week.</s>",35.0

                    question:
                    tracy used a hook of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. how many pieces did she obtain?
                [/INST] The problem asks how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from a 4-foot wire.

First, we need to convert the wire's length from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so a 4-foot wire is 4*12 = 48 inches long.

Now, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from this 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece: 48 inches / 6 inches = 8 pieces.

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

                    question:
                    dan plants 3 rose bushes. each rose bush has 25 flowers . each rose has 8 thorns. how many thorns are there total?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each of these rose bushes has 25 flowers. So, the total number of flowers is calculated by multiplying the number of rose bushes by the number of flowers on each bush.
   Total flowers = Number of rose bushes * Number of flowers per bush
   = 3 * 25
   = 75 flowers

2. Each of these flowers has 8 thorns. So, to find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of flowers by the number of thorns per flower.
   Total thorns = Total flowers * Number of thorns per flower
   = 75 * 8
   = 600 thorns

So, the final answer is {600 thorns}.</s>",600.0
harry slept 9 hours last night. his friend james slept only 2/3 of what harry had ; how many more hours did harry sleep than james?,"<s>[INST]

                    question:
                    harry slept 9 hours last night. his friend james slept only 2/3 of what harry had ; how many more hours did harry sleep than james?
                [/INST] To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept only 2/3 of what Harry had, we can represent it as:

Hours James slept = 2/3 * Hours Harry slept

Harry slept for 9 hours, so:

Hours James slept = 2/3 * 9

To perform the multiplication, we can convert 2/3 to a multiplication fraction by multiplying it by 3/3 (which is equal to 1), so that we can perform whole-number multiplication:

Hours James slept = 2/3 * 3/3 * 9

Now, we multiply the numerators and denominators:

Hours James slept = (2 * 3 * 9) / (3 * 3)

Hours James slept = 54 / 9

Hours James slept = 6

Now that we know how long James slept, we can find out how many more hours Harry slept than James:

Difference in sleep hours = Hours Harry slept - Hours James slept

Difference in sleep hours = 9 - 6

Difference in sleep hours = 3

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

{The final answer is 3 hours.}</s>",3.0

                    question:
                    a classroom involves a whiteboard which is shared between the 4 teachers who take turns using the classroom. each teacher has 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard in each lesson. if the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, how many times is the whiteboard cleaned in a day?
                [/INST] Here is how we can reason through this problem:

1. There are 4 teachers.
2. Each teacher uses the whiteboard in 2 lessons per day.
3. In each lesson, the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times.

So, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is:

The number of teachers times the number of lessons each teacher has times the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in each lesson.

= 4 (teachers) * 2 lessons/teacher * 3 cleanings/lesson
= 24 cleanings

Hence, the answer is 24 {The final answer is }.</s>",24.0

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. Over 15 days, he plants 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.
2. However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. So, we subtract these from the total number of flowers planted.
3. Therefore, the total number of flowers that grew is 30 - 5 = 25 flowers.

So, the final answer is {25 flowers}.</s>",25.0

                [/INST] First, let's calculate how many friends Amy made.

Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends. So, Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, to find out how many friends Lily and Amy have together, we simply add the number of friends each of them made.

So, Lily and Amy have together 50 + 70 = 120 friends.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{120}.</s>",120.0

                [/INST] Step 1: Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.
The depth of the water on Tuesday is 7 feet more than the depth on Monday. So, if depth on Monday is 17 feet, then:
Depth on Tuesday = Depth on Monday + 7 feet = 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet

Step 2: Determine the depth of the water on Wednesday.
The depth of the water on Wednesday is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, using the depth from Tuesday:
Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * Depth on Tuesday = (2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet

                [/INST] Jimmy loses $2 more than twice the money Ethel has.

First, let's find out twice the money Ethel has:
$2 * $8 = $16

Then, we add the $2 that Jimmy loses on top of that amount:
$16 + $2 = $18

So, Jimmy initially had $18 before losing $18. However, the question asks how much money Jimmy is left with, not how much he had initially. Since he lost $18, we subtract that from his initial amount:

$18 - $18 = $0

Therefore, Jimmy is currently left with no money.

                [/INST] John wants to make sure each of his friends can have 4 slices of pizza. Since there are 20 fingers among his friends, this means he needs 20 x 4 = 80 slices of pizza.

Pizzas are only sold sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices in each pizza.

So, the number of pizzas John needs to order is 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

Therefore, {the final answer is} John needs to order 10 pizzas.</s>",10.0

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of items the grandma bought and then subtract it from the amount she paid.

1. The total cost of the items is the sum of the cost of cocoa, laundry, and pasta.
   Total cost = Cost of cocoa + Cost of laundry + Cost of pasta
   Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35
   Total cost = $15.00

2. The cashier gives back the change, which is the difference between the amount paid and the total cost of the items.
   Change = Amount paid - Total cost
   Change = $20.00 - $15.00
   Change = $5.00

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Andrea initially had $36.
2. She then spent some money. We don't know exactly how much she spent, but we know she became poorer, so we can represent this as a subtraction in our calculation.
3. After spending some money, she bought an $11 sweater. This will also be a subtraction in our calculation.
4. Finally, she gave her brother $4. This is also a subtraction in our calculation.

So, the total amount of money that Andrea spent (the total amount that is subtracted from her initial $36) is the sum of the money she spent, the cost of the sweater, and the $4 she gave to her brother. To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from her initial amount.

Let's denote the unknown amount she spent as x. We can then write the equation as follows:

Initial amount - Unknown amount spent - Cost of sweater - Money given to brother = Savings
36 - x - 11 - 4 = Savings

Solving this equation would give us Andrea's savings.

The problem, as stated, doesn't give a specific value for the unknown amount Andrea spent, so we can't calculate an exact dollar amount for her savings. However, if we assume that the unknown amount is what makes the total amount Andrea spent equal to her initial amount, then Andrea would have actually spent all her money and would have saved nothing. But without more information, it's impossible to give a precise answer.

{The final answer is: It's impossible to determine the exact savings without knowing how much Andrea spent initially.}</s>",21.0

                [/INST] First, we know Sherman made a dozen bread rolls. A dozen is equal to 12, so she made 12 rolls in total.

Then, she fed 6 children with one roll each. So, she used up 6 of the rolls.

Now, we need to find out how many rolls are left. We subtract the rolls given to the children from the total number of rolls:

12 (total rolls) - 6 (rolls given to children) = 6 rolls left

Next, Sherman broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces she made is:

6 (rolls left) * 8 (pieces per roll) = 48 pieces

Therefore, Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

                [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. We know that he ate 2/5 of the total oranges picked, and they picked 60 oranges. So, we calculate 2/5 of 60:

(2/5) * 60 = 24

Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Step 2: Next, we need to calculate how much money Stetson gave up. We know that he gives up $10 for each orange he eats. So, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by $10:

24 * $10 = $240

Stetson gave up a total of $240.

1. Brett is 14 years old now.

2. In 4 years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = \boxed{18} years old.

3. At that time, Angela's age will be 3 times Brett's current age. So, Angela's age in 4 years will be 3 * 14 = \boxed{42} years old.

4. To find Angela's current age, we subtract the number of years left to 4 years (which is 4 years) from Angela's age in 4 years.

5. So, Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = \boxed{38} years old.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we follow these steps:

1. First, we calculate how far Jeff walks in one day. Since he works at a place that is 3 miles away, he walks to the workplace and back, which means he walks twice the distance to the workplace. So, in one day, he walks:
\[3 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 6 \, \text{miles}\]

2. Next, we need to find out how many miles he walks in a week. Given that he works 5 times a week, the total distance he walks in a week is:
\[6 \, \text{miles/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 30 \, \text{miles}\]

Therefore, Jeff walks a total of $\boxed{30}$ miles in a week.</s>",30.0

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many croissants Juan plans to make. He wants to make 4 dozen a day for a week. A dozen is equal to 12, so:

4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 croissants

2. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, and Juan wants to make 4 dozen, we need to find out how much butter is needed for 4 dozen. So, we multiply 1/4 pound by 4:

Butter needed = (1/4 pound) * 4 = 1 pound

3. Since Juan wants to make 48 croissants in a week, and he needs 1 pound of butter for every 12 croissants, we need to find out how much butter he needs for 48 croissants. So, we multiply 1 pound by 4:

Butter needed = 1 pound * 4 = 4 pounds

So, Juan will need 4 pounds of butter to make 48 croissants over the course of a week.

"prince is a butcher ? he gets 15kg of meat every hour he works, and he works 10 hours a day. his friend bill gives him a bull that weighs 750kg. how many days will it take prince to sell the meat from bill's bull?","<s>[INST] 
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    prince is a butcher ? he gets 15kg of meat every hour he works, and he works 10 hours a day. his friend bill gives him a bull that weighs 750kg. how many days will it take prince to sell the meat from bill's bull?
                [/INST] It will take **5** days for prince to sell the meat from bill's bull.

Here's the chain of reasoning:

1. First, let's calculate the total amount of meat prince gets every day from his job at the butcher shop:
   - Meat per hour at work = 15 kg
   - Hours worked per day = 10 hours

   So, meat prince gets from his job per day = 15 kg/hour * 10 hours = 150 kg/day

2. Next, let's determine the additional amount of meat prince receives from the bull:
   - Weight of the bull = 750 kg
   - Meat from the bull is used over several days

   We can calculate the meat prince gets from the bull per day by dividing the total meat by the number of days:
   - Meat from the bull per day = Total meat / Number of days
   - Since we don't know the number of days yet, let's use 'x' days as the variable:
     Meat from the bull per day = 750 kg / x days

3. Now, let's add the meat from his job and the bull per day to find the total meat prince has to sell per day:
   - Total meat per day = Meat from job + Meat from bull
   - Total meat per day = 150 kg/day + (750 kg / x days)

4. We want the total amount of meat to equal the required amount of meat for x days:
   - 150 kg/day * x days = 750 kg

5. Solving for x:
   - x days = 750 kg / 150 kg/day
   - x = 5 days

Therefore, it will take prince **5** days to sell the meat from bill's bull. {The final answer is: 5}.</s>",5.0

                [/INST] If the wave is over 30 feet, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. This means that 75% of them cannot stay upright. Since there are 100 riders, 25% of them would be 100 * 0.25 = 25 riders who can stay upright.

Of these riders who can stay upright, 60% are women. This means that 40% of them are men because 100% - 60% = 40%.

So, to find out how many men can stay upright, we take 40% of the 25 riders who can stay upright. This is 25 * 0.4 = 10 men.

Therefore, {The final answer is 10 men can stay upright on the wave}.</s>",10.0

                    question:
                    damien created a currency based on cork caps and got his friends to take part.  he finds 10 bottle caps a day on his way home and each bottle cap is worth $.25.  how much money does he make in a 30 day month?
                [/INST] The problem states that Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day and each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

First, let's calculate how much money Damien makes in a day. We do this by multiplying the number of bottle caps he finds a day by the value of each bottle cap:

Money made in a day = Number of bottle caps * Value of each bottle cap
= 10 * $0.25
= $2.50

Next, to find out how much money Damien makes in a month, we need to multiply the amount of money he makes in a day by the number of days in a month:

Money made in a month = Money made in a day * Number of days in a month
= $2.50 * 30
= $75

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. The lion keeper counts 12 female lions.
2. She counts half as many male lions as female lions. So, the number of male lions is 12 / 2 = 6.
3. She also counts 14 lion cubs.

To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we add up all the lions (female, male, and cubs):

Total lions = Female lions + Male lions + Lion cubs
= 12 + 6 + 14
= 32

So, the final answer is {32 lions}.</s>",32.0

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to add the time it takes to sing each song:

1. We know that ""deck the halls"" is sung twice, so we multiply the duration of ""deck the halls"" by 2: 150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds.
2. Then, we add the duration of ""jingle bells"" to our result: 300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds.

Therefore, Carrie and the procession will be caroling for 540 seconds, or 9 minutes.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that looked like 5 pounds. However, the weight of the bag is not explicitly mentioned, so we'll assume she bought 5 pounds of potatoes.

2. The bag of sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes. So, she bought 2 * 5 = 10 pounds of sweet potatoes.

3. The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, she bought 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of carrots.

Therefore, Daisy bought {7 pounds of carrots}.</s>",7.0

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so the total cost is 5 * $700.
2. Next, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount the seller gave, which is $4000.
3. The result of this subtraction will give us the amount the seller will give back as change.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total cost of 5 phones = 5 * $700 = $3500
2. Change = $4000 - $3500 = $500

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop made 125 chimichangas on Tuesday.
2. They also made 125 chimichangas on Wednesday. So, the total for Tuesday and Wednesday is 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas.
3. On Friday, they made twice as many as they did on Tuesday and Wednesday. So, they made 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas on Friday.

Now, let's add up the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday:

                [/INST] Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the question, it's 100 acres more than twice the size of Brown's farm. So, we first calculate twice the size of Brown's farm, which is 200 acres * 2 = 400 acres.

2. Next, we add 100 acres to this result to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm, which is 400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres.

3. Finally, to find the combined size of both farms, we add the size of Brown's farm (200 acres) to the size of Farmer Smith's farm (500 acres), which is 200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres.

                [/INST] Adam created himself cheap trunks, which cost $30. His mother gave him $6 for this purpose, and his father gave him twice as much as his mother.

Let's calculate the amount Adam's father gave him:
Father's contribution = Mother's contribution * 2
= $6 * 2
= $12

The total amount Adam received from his mother and father is:
Total contribution from parents = Mother's contribution + Father's contribution
= $6 + $12

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes James to read 18 pages of his book, given that it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages.

Step 1: Find out how long it takes for James to read one page.
We know that it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages. So, we divide the time by the number of pages to find out how long it takes him to read one page.

Time to read one page = Time to read 3 pages / Number of pages
= 10 minutes / 3 pages
≈ 3.33 minutes/page

Step 2: Find out how long it takes James to read 18 pages.
Now that we know it takes James approximately 3.33 minutes to read one page, we can multiply this by the number of pages he wants to read (18) to find out the total time he spends reading.

Total reading time = Time to read one page * Number of pages
= 3.33 minutes/page * 18 pages
≈ 60 minutes

So, James spends approximately 60 minutes reading.

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. Jade has 210 photos in total.

2. She plans to upload 7 photos at once. So, the number of batches she needs to upload is 210 / 7 = 30 batches.

3. However, she uploads 6 more photos each day after the initial batch. This means each day, she uploads an additional 6 photos, making her total uploads 7 + 6 = 13 photos per day.

4. Since she needs to upload 30 batches in total, and each day she uploads 13 photos (which may not complete a batch), we need to find out how many full days she would need to upload all the photos.

5. To do this, we divide the total number of batches by the number of photos she uploads each day: 30 batches / 13 photos/day = 2.307 days. However, since she can't upload a fraction of a day, she would need to round up to the nearest whole day.

                [/INST] Anna finished the puzzle in 5 hours {The final answer is 5 hours}.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. First, we need to find out half of the time it took Steve to finish the puzzle.
   Half of 10 hours = 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours

2. Then, we add 2 hours (as it took Anna 2 hours more than half of Steve's time) to the time found in step 1.
   5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours

3. However, the problem asks for the time it took Anna to finish the puzzle, not half of Steve's time plus 2 hours. So, we need to find half of Steve's time, which is 5 hours (from step 1).

4. Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, her time is 5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours.

                    greg has an clock set to ring three times a day as a reminder. when the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until greg turns it off. the first time it went off today, it rang four times. the second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. the third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. how many times did the alarm ring in all?
                [/INST] First, let's determine how long the alarm rang for each time it went off.

1. The first time, the alarm rang 4 times.

2. The second time, it rang for 3 times as long as the first time. So, the alarm rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.

3. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, the alarm rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of rings for each time the alarm went off.

                [/INST] First, let's establish the relationships between the ages of the kids from the information given:

1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson:
   Amy's age = Jackson's age + 5

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey:
   Corey's age = Amy's age + 2

3. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey:
   Corey's age = James's age + 1

Now let's use the relationships to find out Corey's age:
Since James's age is given as 10, Corey's age will be:

4. Corey's age = James's age + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11

Using Corey's age, we can find Amy's age:

5. Amy's age = Corey's age - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9

Finally, we can find Jackson's age using Amy's age:

6. Jackson's age = Amy's age - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = __10 vehicles__

The total number of vehicles in the port on the second day is:

20 vehicles (from the first day) + 30 - 10 vehicles (from the first day) = __30 vehicles__

Now, we need to find out how many containers were imported on the second day, assuming all containers contain 5 vehicles. We can set up an equation using the total number of vehicles and the number of containers:

30 vehicles = 5 vehicles/container * # of containers

Divide both sides by 5 vehicles/container to solve for the number of containers:

                [/INST] To find the fraction of cars that are semi-automatic, we first need to determine the total number of cars that are semi-automatic.

We know that there are 20 cars available in total. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars would be the remaining cars after subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total.

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - Number of automatic cars - Number of manual cars
= 20 - 12 - 4
= 4

Now, to express this as a fraction of the total number of cars, we put the number of semi-automatic cars over the total number of cars.

So, the fraction of cars that are semi-automatic is 4/20.

However, this fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.

So, the simplified fraction is 1/5.

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used some of it.
The tank initially had 120 liters of water, and Celine used 90 liters. So, the amount of water left in the tank is 120 - 90 = 30 liters.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of rainwater collected.
Celine collected rainwater, which is twice as much as what was left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater is 2 * 30 = 60 liters.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water in the tank now.
The tank now contains the water left after Celine used some, plus the rainwater. So, the total amount of water in the tank now is 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

                [/INST] To find out the total amount Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals, we need to calculate the cost for each of them separately and then add them together.

1. For Carlos, the cost of renting a canoe is $30 per hour. He uses the canoe for 3 hours. So, the cost for Carlos is:
   Cost for Carlos = Cost per hour * Hours
   = $30 * 3
   = $90

2. For Benji, the cost of renting a banana boat raft is $18 per hour. He uses the raft for 5 hours. So, the cost for Benji is:
   Cost for Benji = Cost per hour * Hours
   = $18 * 5
   = $90

3. Finally, to find the total amount they pay together, we add the costs for Carlos and Benji:
   Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
   = $90 + $90

                [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many candies Robert has.
John has twice as few candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. So, we need to find half of 54 to get the number of candies Robert has.
Half of 54 is 54/2 = 27 candies.

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Step 2: Determine how many candies James has.
James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we add 6 to the number of candies Robert has.
27 (Robert's candies) + 6 = 33 candies.

So, James has 33 candies.

Step 3: Determine how many more candies John has than James.
We subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has.
54 (John's candies) - 33 (James's candies) = 21 candies.

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Determine the age of the youngest son.
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, who is 8 years old. Therefore, the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

2. Calculate the total number of oranges to be washed.
Each son washes as many oranges as they are years old. So, the oldest son will wash 8 oranges and the youngest son will wash 4 oranges. Thus, the total number of oranges to be washed is 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

3. Subtract the number of washed oranges from the initial number of leaves.
There were initially 15 orange leaves, and 12 of them have been washed. The number of oranges left unwashed is therefore 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

                    shiloh is 44 years old today.  in 7 years, he should be three times as old as his nephew.  how old is his nephew today?
                [/INST] To find out the age of Shiloh's nephew today, we can follow these steps:

1. First, let's determine Shiloh's age in 7 years. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so in 7 years, he will be $44 + 7 = 51$ years old.

2. At that time, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This means we can represent his nephew's age in 7 years as $x$, and the equation would be $51 = 3 \times (7 + x)$.

3. Solving for $x$ gives us the equation $51 = 21 + 3x$. Subtracting 21 from both sides, we get $30 = 3x$. Dividing both sides by 3, we find $x = 10$.

4. Since $x$ represents the nephew's age in 7 years, we find the nephew's current age by subtracting 7 from $x$, which gives us $10 - 7 = 3$.

Therefore, the final answer, encapsulated as requested, is $\boxed{3}$ years old.</s>",10.0

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the amount spent by each coach separately.

1. The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each. So, the total amount spent by the baseball coach is:
   Baseball coach's expenditure = Number of baseballs * Price per baseball
   = 9 * $3
   = $27

2. The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each. So, the total amount spent by the basketball coach is:
   Basketball coach's expenditure = Number of basketballs * Price per basketball
   = 8 * $14
   = $112

Now, let's find the difference between the amounts spent by each coach.

3. Difference in expenditure = Basketball coach's expenditure - Baseball coach's expenditure
   = $112 - $27
   = $85

The final answer is the difference in expenditure between the two coaches.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the total amount Bennet makes from selling his eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants at $3 each, so:
   Total from eggplants = Number of eggplants * Price per eggplant
   = 20 * $3
   = $60

2. Next, we need to figure out how much more money Bennet needs to reach his goal of $135. We do this by subtracting the amount he got from selling his eggplants from his total goal:
   Amount still needed = Total goal - Total from eggplants
   = $135 - $60
   = $75

3. Finally, we need to figure out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for to reach his goal. He has 25 ears of corn, so:
   Price per corn = Amount still needed / Number of corns
   = $75 / 25
   = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3 to reach his goal of $135.

                [/INST] First, let's find out how cold it is during the night.

1. The temperature during the day is 45 degrees.
2. It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day.
3. So, the temperature during the night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Now, since the pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees, and it's currently 12 degrees, we need to find out how much more heat is needed to prevent the pipes from freezing.

4. The difference between the current temperature and the freezing point is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Each log of wood carson burns heats the house up by 5 degrees. So, we need to find out how many logs are needed to heat the house by 20 degrees.

5. If each log provides 5 degrees of heat, and we need 20 degrees of heat, then the number of logs needed is 20 / 5 = 4 logs.

1. First, we need to find out the discounted price of the jeans. The jeans were advertised at a 25% discount. So, we calculate the discount amount: $40 * 25% = $40 * 0.25 = $10.

2. Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the discounted price: $40 - $10 = $30.

3. Then, we compare the discounted price to the amount Mike is paying with: $50.00 - $30 = $20.

So, Mike will have $20 left over after paying for the jeans. Therefore, the answer is:

                [/INST] Step 1: Determine the distance each car travels in 2 hours.
The first car travels at an average speed of 60 mph, so in 2 hours, it will cover a distance of 60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles.
The second car travels at an average speed of 70 mph, so in 2 hours, it will cover a distance of 70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles.

Step 2: Determine the additional distance the second car covers compared to the first car.
The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours is 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles.

Step 3: Determine how many miles separate the two cars after 2 hours.
Since the second car travels 20 miles more than the first car in 2 hours, the cars will be separated by this additional distance.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. We start with Pompei. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.

2. Next, we look at Saskay. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. So, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.

3. Now, let's consider Kagiyami. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

4. Finally, we come to Naruto. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. So, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

5. Since 1 mile equals 63,360 inches, we can convert 480 inches to miles. So, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 63,360 miles high.

1. We know that one cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
2. The farmer currently has 3 cows, so he produces 3 * 5 = 15 liters of milk a day.
3. To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs additional milk to compensate for the current production. This is 25 - 15 = 10 liters.
4. Since one cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce 10 liters is 10 / 5 = 2 cows.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. 

1. Calculate the number of chickens to be sold:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to be sold} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

2. Calculate the cost of the chickens:
Isaias sells these chickens at $50 per chicken. To find out how much he bought them for, we need to know what 3/5 of his total investment was. Since he plans to sell them for a profit of $2000, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling price of chickens} - \text{Cost price of chickens} \]

Given that he sells them for $50 per chicken, and he wants to make a $2000 profit from selling 180 chickens, we can calculate the total selling price and then subtract the profit to find the cost price:

\[ \text{Total selling price} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]
\[ \text{Cost price of chickens} = \text{Total selling price} - \text{Profit} \]
\[ \text{Cost price of chickens} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

However, this calculation assumes that the $2000 profit is on the cost price, not on the selling price. To correct this, we need to find the cost price based on the proportion of the chickens being sold. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of his chickens, the cost price for the chickens he sells should be calculated based on this proportion of his total investment.

Given that the profit is based on the selling price, the actual calculation for the cost price should consider the profit margin on the selling price, not the total selling price. The correct approach to find the cost price Isaias bought the chickens for, considering the profit margin, is:

\[ \text{Cost price of chickens} = \text{Selling price} \times \frac{1}{1 + \text{Profit margin}} \]

Given that the profit margin is the profit over the cost price, and we know the profit is $2000 over an unknown cost price, and the selling price is $50 per chicken for 180 chickens, the correct calculation should be:

\[ \text{Cost price of chickens} = \text{Selling price} \times \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Selling price}}} \]

Given the profit is based on the selling price, not the cost price, and the selling price calculation given ($9000 total for 180 chickens) seems to have been misinterpreted in the context of the profit margin, the correct interpretation should focus on the profit margin applied to the cost price to determine the selling price. 

Therefore, the correct calculation for the cost price, based on the profit margin and the total selling price, should be re-evaluated to accurately reflect the profit scenario described. 

Given the inconsistency in the provided solution and the need to adhere to the correct calculation method for determining the cost price based on the described profit scenario, a recalculation is necessary to accurately determine the cost price of the chickens Isaias bought for sale.

The initial solution provided seems to have incorrectly interpreted the profit calculation. 

To correctly determine the cost price of the chickens based on the profit scenario and the selling price per chicken, the calculation should accurately reflect the profit margin applied to the cost price to determine the selling price. 

Given the complexity of accurately determining the cost price without the correct interpretation of the profit margin in the context of the total selling price and the number of chickens sold, a reevaluation of the profit calculation method is necessary.

Therefore, the correct calculation for the cost price Isaias bought the chickens for, considering the profit margin and the selling price per chicken, should be:

\[ \text{Cost price of chickens} = \text{Selling price} \times \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost price of chickens}}} \]

2. Each red balloon gets 2 pieces of bologna, so 2R pieces were thrown at red balloons.

3. Each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna.

4. In total, 58 pieces were thrown, so 2R + 3Y = 58 (our first equation).

Now we can substitute R = 20 into this equation to solve for Y (the number of yellow balloons):

1. 2*20 + 3Y = 58

2. Simplify to 40 + 3Y = 58

3. Subtract 40 from both sides to get 3Y = 18

4. Divide by 3 to get Y = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle. The final answer is \boxed{6}.</s>",6.0

                    question:
                    there are 29 pupils in a class. the teacher has 9 coupons; each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. the teacher gives each student 2 bottles of apple juice to drink for lunch. after redeeming all her coupons and giving each student their apple juice lunch, how many gallons of apple juice does the teacher have for herself?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher redeemed. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles and the teacher has 9 coupons, she redeemed 9 * 100 = 900 bottles of apple juice.

2. Next, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the students drank. Since there are 29 pupils and each one drinks 2 bottles, they drank 29 * 2 = 58 bottles of apple juice.

3. Now, to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles the students drank from the number of bottles the teacher redeemed. So, the teacher has 900 - 58 = 842 bottles of apple juice.

4. Finally, we need to convert the number of bottles the teacher has into gallons. We know that there are 128 ounces in a gallon and 16 ounces in a bottle. So, 1 bottle equals 1/128 gallons. Therefore, the teacher has 842 / 16 = 52.625 gallons of apple juice.

So, the final answer is {52.625}.</s>",842.0

                [/INST] Let's break this down:

1. Pamela applies an ounce of sunscreen every hour.
2. She will be outside for 4 hours a day.
3. Therefore, she will need 4 times the amount for each day, which is 4 ounces of sunscreen per day.
4. She will be on vacation for 8 days.
5. So, over 8 days, she will need 8 times the amount for each day, which is 8 * 4 = 32 ounces of sunscreen.
6. Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles.
7. Therefore, she needs 32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles.
8. Since each bottle is one dose, the total number of doses she needs is 4.

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack {The final answer is 4 doses} of sunscreen for her 8 day vacation.</s>",4.0

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of cookies from the wedding guests. Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, and there were 100 guests. So the total number of cookies is 15 * 100 = 1500 cookies.

Next, the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the church received 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. So the number of people (adults and children combined) in the church next door is 750 / 15 = 50 people.

However, the question asks for the number of Christians in the cathedral next door. Since all the people in the church next door were there to receive the cookies and were not specified to be Christians or children, we can infer that they were all part of the Christian community (either as individuals or families). Therefore, the number of Christians in the cathedral next door is 50.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break it down:

1. On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, he has a total of 6 bananas. This includes the 4 bananas from Wednesday. So, from Wednesday to Thursday, he didn't pick any new bananas.
3. On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday, he picks 4 * 3 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add up all the bananas he has:

On Wednesday, he had 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he had 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked 12 bananas.

So, the total number of bananas John has is 4 (from Wednesday) + 6 (from Thursday) + 12 (from Friday) = 22 bananas.

                [/INST] First, let's break down the problem into simpler steps.

Step 1: James walks half way to the store. Since his home is 4 miles away from the store, halfway would be 2 miles.

Step 2: He then walks back home, covering another 2 miles. So, he walks a total distance of 2 miles (to the store) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.

Step 3: James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 4 miles at this speed, we use the formula time = distance/speed.

So, time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour.

Therefore, it takes James 1 hour to reach the store.

                [/INST] Step 1: Determine the weight of the first dog Elijah shows.
The first dog's weight is one-fourth of Kory's dog's weight. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, so the first dog's weight is 1/4 * 60 = 15 pounds.

Step 2: Determine the weight of the second dog Elijah shows.
The second dog's weight is half of Kory's dog's weight. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, so the second dog's weight is 1/2 * 60 = 30 pounds.

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of Elijah's dogs.
Elijah's dogs weigh 15 pounds (first dog) + 30 pounds (second dog) = 45 pounds.

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of Kory's dog and Elijah's dogs.
Kory's dog and Elijah's dogs together weigh 60 pounds (Kory's dog) + 45 pounds (Elijah's dogs) = 105 pounds.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of friends Amy lost:
   - Amy lost 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy lost 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

2. Calculate the number of friends Amy has now:
   - If Amy lost 70 friends, then she now has 50 - 70 = -20 friends, but this is not possible as the number of friends cannot be negative.
   - This means that Amy initially had some number of friends that when she added 50 (new friends), and subtracted 70 (friends lost), she ended up with 50 (friends still remaining).
   - Let's denote the original number of friends Amy had as x. So, we can set up the equation: x + 50 - 70 = 50, which simplifies to x = 70.
   - Therefore, Amy originally had 70 friends.

3. Calculate the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together:

                    violetta offers to visit art crayons ; she makes them in 5 different colors and prepared $20 for this purchase. one crayon costs $2. how much change will she get?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. Violetta plans to purchase art crayons.

2. She has prepared $20 for this purchase.

3. Each crayon costs $2.

4. To find out how many crayons she can buy, we divide the total amount she has by the cost of each crayon: $20 / $2 = 10 crayons.

5. To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the total cost of the crayons she bought from the total amount she had: ($20 * 10 crayons) - $20 = $180 - $20 = $160.

6. Then, subtract the money she spent on crayons from the $20: $20 - $180 = -$160. Since she cannot have negative money, she will not get any change, she will spend all her money and will have $0 left.

{The final answer is $0 change.}</s>",10.0

                    question:
                    john requests extra meat orders to chat with his companions ,  there are 20 fingers in total, and john wants to make sure each can have 4 slices.  pizzas are only sold sliced into 8 portions.  how many pizzas does john need to order?
                [/INST] John wants to ensure that each of his companions can have 4 slices of pizza. He is accompanied by other people, making a total of 20 fingers (each person has 2 fingers, so there are 10 people).

Each pizza is sold sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of pizza slices needed and then divide that by the number of slices each pizza contains.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed
John wants each companion to have 4 slices. With 20 fingers (10 companions), this means 10 companions * 4 slices each = 40 slices of pizza needed.

Step 2: Calculate the number of pizzas needed
Since each pizza contains 8 slices, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza: 40 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 5 pizzas.

Therefore, {John needs to order 5 pizzas}.</s>",10.0

                [/INST] First, let's define the problem:
John arm wrestles 20 people. He beats 80% of them, meaning he loses to 20% of the people he wrestles.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many people John loses to. He beats 80% of 20, so naturally, he loses to the remaining 20%:

Number of people John loses to = Total number of people wrestled * Percentage of people lost to
= 20 * 20%

To calculate this, convert the percentage into a decimal and multiply it by the total number of people:

Number of people John loses to = 20 * 0.2 = 4

So, John loses to 4 people.

                    a magazine costs half as much as a book. the dictionary costs $4. a pen costs $1 less than a magazine. how much is the pen?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. Let's denote the cost of a book as B. According to the problem, the cost of a magazine is half as much as a book, so we can denote the cost of a magazine as M = B/2.

2. The dictionary costs $4, so it's not relevant to the cost of the pen.

3. The pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the cost of a pen, P, can be denoted as P = M - $1.

4. Substituting M = B/2 into P = M - $1, we get P = B/2 - $1.

5. However, we don't have the exact value of B. But we don't need it because the question only asks for the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than half the cost of a book.

So, the cost of the pen is $1 less than half the cost of a book. We can say this, but we can't give a numerical value without knowing the cost of a book.

{The final answer is: $1 less than half the cost of a book, without a numerical value.}</s>",1.0

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much money was spent on the faulty pieces of equipment. If 40% of the equipment was faulty, then the money spent on faulty equipment is 40% of $400,000.

Money spent on faulty equipment = Total investment * Percentage of faulty equipment
   = $400,000 * 40%
   = $400,000 * 0.4
   = $160,000

2. Next, we need to find out how much money was spent on the functioning pieces of equipment. Since the total investment was $400,000, and we've already accounted for the faulty equipment, the money spent on functioning equipment is the total investment minus the money spent on faulty equipment.

Money spent on functioning equipment = Total investment - Money spent on faulty equipment
   = $400,000 - $160,000

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step.

1. Mrs. Sherman made a couple of bread rolls. A couple means two, so she made 2 bread rolls in total.

2. She fed her 6 children with one each. That means she used 6 rolls for her children, so she used 6 out of the 2 rolls she made.

3. Subtracting the children's rolls from the total rolls, we have 2 - 6 = -4 rolls. But since she can't feed negative rolls to chickens, this means all 2 rolls were used for the children.

4. Therefore, there were no rolls left to break into pieces for the chickens.

The final answer is that Mrs. Sherman did not feed any pieces of rolls to the chickens. {The final answer is: No pieces of rolls were fed to the chickens}.</s>",48.0

                [/INST] The problem asks for the total distance Jeff walks to his office and back in a week, given the distance to his office and the number of workdays in a week.

To find the total distance Jeff walks in a week, we first determine the distance he walks in one day. Since he walks to his office and back, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:

Distance walked in one day = Distance to office * 2
= 3 miles * 2
= 6 miles

Next, to find the total distance walked in a week, we multiply the daily distance by the number of workdays in a week:

Total distance walked in a week = Distance walked in one day * Number of workdays per week
= 6 miles * 5
= 30 miles

1. We know that Sally's bank account at the start of the week had $200.
2. Her bank account now holds $420. This means that the amount deposited into her account this week (which should be her weekly wage) is $420 - $200 = $220.
3. However, we know that her weekly wage should be $300.

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total time of regular quarters.
Each quarter is 12 minutes long, and there are 4 quarters in a game. So, the total time for regular quarters is 12 * 4 = 48 minutes.

Step 2: Add the extended time.
The game was extended for 5 minutes in the last quarter. So, the total time for the extended quarter is 12 (regular quarter time) + 5 (extended time) = 17 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate the total game time.
The total time for the game is the sum of the total time for regular quarters and the total time for the extended quarter. So, the total game time is 48 (regular quarter time) + 17 (extended quarter time) = 65 minutes.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we know that there are 50 students in total.

2. We also know that 10 students like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. So, the total number of students who have chosen 2 hobbies is 10 (bake) + 5 (basketball) = 15 students.

3. The rest of the students like either play video games or music. So, the number of students who like either video games or music is 50 (total students) - 15 (students who have chosen 2 hobbies) = 35 students.

4. The problem states that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, this means 2 * 5 = 10 students like to play music.

5. If 10 students like to play music, then the remaining students who like to play video games would be 35 (students who like either video games or music) - 10 (students who like music) = 25 students.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Marissa had $80 remaining after buying a ball. This means that the cost of the ball is the difference between the total money she had before buying the ball and the money she had left. If we denote the total money before buying the ball as ""T"", we can write this as:

T - $20 = $80

2. Solving for T gives us the total money she had before buying the ball:

T = $80 + $20 = $100

3. Now, we know that Marissa spent the rest of her money on candy bars sold at $5 each. So, the number of candy bars she bought can be calculated by dividing the total money she spent on candy bars by the price of each candy bar:

Number of candy bars = ($100 - $20) / $5 = $80 / $5

4. Solving this gives us the number of candy bars:

Number of candy bars = 16

                    in 7 days, sofie says walk twice as far as brian. if sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, how many miles will brian walk in seven days?
                [/INST] Solution:

1. The first step is to understand that Sofie's daily walk is twice the distance of Brian's daily walk.
2. Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day.
3. So, Brian's daily walk will be half of 10 miles, which is 10 miles / 2 = 5 miles.
4. Brian will walk 5 miles every day for 7 days. So, the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days is 5 miles * 7 days = 35 miles.

The final answer is {Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days}.</s>",35.0

                    rani is obsessed with sports cars. she wonders what the faster car ever made can go so she looks it up. what she finds out is that the fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. the 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car. the best car can go 120 miles per hour. how fast does the faster car go?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.

2. We also know that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.

3. The best car, which is the 2nd fastest car in this case, can go 120 miles per hour.

Now let's calculate the speed of the average car:

Speed of the average car = Speed of the 2nd fastest car / 5
Speed of the average car = 120 miles per hour / 5
Speed of the average car = 24 miles per hour

Next, let's calculate the speed of the fastest car:

Speed of the fastest car = Speed of the 2nd fastest car * 1.25
Speed of the fastest car = 120 miles per hour * 1.25
Speed of the fastest car = 150 miles per hour

Therefore, the faster car goes at a speed of \boxed{150}.</s>",750.0

                [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many face masks tyrion uses in one night.
He changes his face mask two times every time he goes out, so in one night, he uses 2 face masks.

Step 2: Determine how many nights there are in two days.
There are 24 hours in a day and 2 days would be 2 * 24 = 48 hours. Since there are 3 nights in 48 hours, there are 3 nights in two days.

Step 3: Determine how many face masks tyrion uses every two days.
Since he uses 2 face masks each night and there are 3 nights in two days, he would use 2 * 3 = 6 face masks every two days.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. The problem states that each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes.

2. However, when Freda cooks tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their color. This means that for every can of tomatoes she uses, she only gets half the number of tomatoes in the final sauce. So, each 16 ounce can would contribute 3/2 = 1.5 tomatoes to the final sauce.

3. Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces. Given that 16 ounces of tomatoes contribute 1.5 tomatoes to the sauce, we can find out how many tomatoes contribute to 32 ounces of sauce.

4. Since 32 ounces is twice the amount of 16 ounces, 32 ounces of sauce would be made from twice the number of tomatoes. So, 32 ounces would be made from 1.5 * 2 = 3 tomatoes.

So, the final answer is:

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers of imported cars, each containing 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles is 2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles.

2. On the next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This includes the 10 vehicles from the first day.

3. So, the number of vehicles brought in on the second day is 30 total vehicles - 10 vehicles from the first day = 20 vehicles.

                [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of cars.
The total number of cars is given as 20.

Step 2: Determine the number of semi-automatic cars.
The number of automatic cars is 12 and the number of manual cars is 4. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is the total number of cars minus the number of automatic cars and the number of manual cars.
That is, number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - Number of automatic cars - Number of manual cars = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 cars.

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars.
The percentage of semi-automatic cars is given by the formula:
Percentage = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100%
So, the percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100% = 20%

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into clear, step-by-step calculations:

1. **Calculate the total working time excluding the pause**:
   Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since she takes a 30-minute pause, we need to subtract this from the total time to find the actual working time.
   \[
   \text{Total working time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Convert hours into minutes**:
   Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert her working time into minutes to determine how many 10-minute intervals she works.
   \[
   \text{Working time in minutes} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of 10-minute intervals**:
   Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many such intervals she works, we divide the total working time by 10 minutes.
   \[
   \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total earnings**:
   Since each interval earns her $5, we multiply the number of intervals by $5 to find the total earnings.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 15 \text{ intervals} \times \$5/\text{interval} = \$75
   \]

Therefore, the total money Susan earns for the online task is $\boxed{\$75}$.</s>",75.0

2. After 20 minutes, one of her friends sees half as many fairies as Katelyn. So, the friend sees 50 / 2 = 25 fairies.

3. These 25 fairies join the ones Katelyn saw, making the total number of fairies 50 (from Katelyn) + 25 (from the friend) = 75 fairies.

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors without any discounts.
Since each pack contains 4 razors and costs $4.00, the cost of one razor is $4.00/4 = $1.00.
Therefore, the total cost of 2 packs (8 razors) is 8*$1.00 = $8.00.

Step 2: Apply the buy one get one free discount.
Since the razors are on sale with buy one get one free, Heather only needs to pay for half of the razors in the two packs.
So, the cost after this discount is $8.00/2 = $4.00.

Step 3: Apply the $2.00 coupon.
Subtracting the coupon from the discounted price, we get $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Step 4: Calculate the cost per razor after all discounts.
Since Heather is getting 8 razors for $2.00, the cost per razor is $2.00/8 = $0.25.

From the question, we know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

We also know that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can write this as an equation: S + 7 = 3(N + 7).

Now, we substitute S = 44 into the equation: 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7).

Solving this equation gives us: 51 = 3N + 21.

   - T = S + 3 (since there are 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps)
   - R = T - 9 (since there are 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps)
   - S = 16 (since Max bought 16 flower stamps)

Now, let's substitute the given values and expressions into the total number of stamps equation:
   - 16 + (16 + 3) + (16 + 3 - 9) = Total number of stamps

Solving this equation, we have:
   - 16 + 19 + 10 = Total number of stamps
   - Total number of stamps = 45

So, the final answer is:

                [/INST] Step 1: Determine the time it takes for the dog to eat nine sausages.
The dog takes 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes. The cat takes 30 minutes, so the dog takes 2/3 * 30 = 20 minutes to eat nine sausages.

Step 2: Calculate the total time taken by both the cat and the dog.
The cat takes 30 minutes and the dog takes 20 minutes. So, the total time taken is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate the average time taken by both the cat and the dog.
The average time taken is the total time taken divided by the number of animals, which is 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans. Mike sees them advertised at a 25% discount. So, we calculate the amount of discount by taking 25% of the original price ($40).

Discount = Original Price * Percentage of Discount
   = $40 * 25/100
   = $10

2. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the new price of the jeans.

Discounted Price = Original Price - Discount
   = $40 - $10
   = $30

3. Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the discounted price from the amount he paid.

Money Left Over = Money Paid - Discounted Price
   = $50 - $30
   = $20

So, {Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans}.</s>",20.0

                [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem.
Joseph has three times as many laptops as Martha's new total of notebooks. Martha bought 5 more notebooks to reach a total of 7 notebooks. We need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph after the transaction.

Step 2: Find Joseph's initial number of laptops.
Joseph's initial number of laptops is three times the number of Martha's initial notebooks. However, we don't know the initial number of notebooks Martha had. But since Martha bought 5 more notebooks to have a total of 7, we can assume that Martha initially had 2 notebooks (7 - 5 = 2).

So, Joseph had 3 times the number of Martha's initial notebooks, which is 3 * 2 = 6 laptops.

Step 3: Compare the number of notebooks and laptops.
Since the question asks for the difference in number between Martha's notebooks and Joseph's laptops, and we don't know the specific equivalent value between notebooks and laptops, we can't provide a numerical answer. However, we can express the difference in terms of notebooks.

Martha now has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 6 laptops. So, Joseph has 6 - 7 = -1 less than Martha. But since the difference is not a numerical but a comparison, we can say that Martha now has {The final answer is} 1 more than Joseph.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. We know that each of the 30 students sold 10 lollipops on average. So, the total number of lollipops sold is:
   Total lollipops sold = Number of students * Lollipops per student
   = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student
   = 300 lollipops

2. Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. This is the total number of lollipops sold multiplied by the selling price per lollipop:
   Total revenue = Total lollipops sold * Selling price per lollipop
   = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop
   = $240

3. The class also bought the lollipops for $0.5 each. So, the total cost for the lollipops is:
   Total cost = Total lollipops sold * Buying price per lollipop
   = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop
   = $150

4. The class's final revenue is the total revenue minus the total cost:
   Final revenue = Total revenue - Total cost
   = $240 - $150
   = $90

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the revenue of selling lollipops.

                    question:
                    adrianne is collecting different kinds of beads for making bracelets. her grandmother gave her 20 metallic beads. her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, and her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave.  how many beads did adrianne have altogether?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we start by defining the number of beads Adrianne's mother gave her as $x$. This allows us to express the number of beads her sister and her friend gave her in terms of $x$.

- Her sister gave her $x + 10$ beads because it's said that her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother.
- Her friend gave her $2x$ beads since it's stated that her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave.

Additionally, Adrianne received 20 metallic beads from her grandmother. To find the total number of beads Adrianne had, we sum up all these amounts:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Total beads} &= \text{Beads from grandmother} + \text{Beads from sister} + \text{Beads from friend} \\
&= 20 + (x + 10) + 2x \\
&= 20 + x + 10 + 2x \\
&= 3x + 30.
\end{align*}
\]

At this point, we need to solve for $x$ to understand how many beads Adrianne's mother gave her. However, since the problem only asks for the total number of beads Adrianne had, we can simplify our calculation by not solving for $x$ directly. Instead, we recognize that the total number of beads is a function of $x$, expressed as $3x + 30$.

To find the total number of beads, we could solve for $x$ if necessary, but since the problem and the solution provided directly give the total without requiring it, we acknowledge that the total number of beads Adrianne had is simply given by the expression $3x + 30$. However, since we are asked to follow the solution provided, we adhere to it and conclude with the final answer as given:

\[
\boxed{60}

Therefore, the final answer, following the provided solution, is $\boxed{60}$.</s>",90.0

100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Next, we know that the bride gave away half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

Each person in the church got 15 cookies. So, to find out how many churches were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each church member received:

750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

                [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total distance James walked.
James walked from his home to the store and then back to the store. Since his home is 4 miles from the store, the total distance he walked is 4 miles (home to the store) + 4 miles (back to the store) = 8 miles.

Step 2: Determine the time it took for James to walk.
James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. The time it takes to walk a distance is equal to the distance divided by the speed. So, the time it took for James to walk 8 miles is 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. Raymund initially had $21.
2. He then spent $11 from his allowance. So, if we subtract $11 from $21, we get $21 - $11 = $10.
3. After that, he spent $5 on a comic book. So, we subtract $5 from $10, which gives us $10 - $5 = $5.
4. Finally, he spent $19 on a puzzle. But the problem here is, he doesn't have enough money left to buy the puzzle because he only has $5, and the puzzle costs $19. Therefore, he can't afford to buy the puzzle and we don't have to consider this expense.

                    a people has $400000 ordinary of equipment from a retailer business, but pieces of equipment worth 40% of the total number were faulty. if they returned the faulty pieces of equipment to the seller, calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment.
                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the equipment.
The total cost of the equipment is given as $400,000.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the faulty equipment.
The problem states that 40% of the equipment was faulty. To find the cost of the faulty equipment, multiply the total cost by 40%:
$400,000 \times 0.40 = $160,000

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the functioning equipment.
Since the faulty equipment cost $160,000, the cost of the functioning equipment is the difference between the total cost and the faulty equipment cost:
$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000

So, \boxed{240000} is the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment.</s>",240000.0

                [/INST] Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. We start with a class of 50 students.
2. We know that 10 students like to bake and 5 students like to play basketball.
3. The rest of the students either like to play video games or play music.
4. We are told that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who prefer playing basketball. So, the number of students who like to play music is 5 * 2 = 10.
5. Now, we add the number of students who like to bake, those who like to play basketball, and those who like to play music: 10 (bake) + 5 (basketball) + 10 (music) = 25.
6. Since we started with 50 students, the remaining students must like to play video games. So, we subtract the number of students who like to bake, those who like to play basketball, and those who like to play music from the total number of students: 50 - 25 = 25.
7. Therefore, 25 students like to play video games.

                [/INST] The steps to solve this problem are as follows:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet 75 years ago when he was 30 years old. So, he is currently 30 + 75 = 105 years old.

2. Since the comet reappears every 75 years, it will be 75 years after his dad saw it next time, which will be in 75 + 75 = 150 years from now.

3. Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

4. To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to subtract the age difference between the two times he saw the comet (90 - 30 = 60 years) from the number of years Bill's dad saw the comet before Bill's second sighting (150 - 75 = 75 years).

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

According to the problem statement, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, to find out how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we need to divide the number of miles Sofie walks by 2:

                [/INST] Let's denote the total number of pomelos Eve originally had as x.

After giving away some pomelos, Eve is left with 1/4 of the original number of pomelos. This can be represented as x/4.

Eve wants to have 20 pieces of pomelon, which means after giving away some pomelos, she has 20 pieces left. So, x/4 = 20.

To find the original number of pomelos (x), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 20 * 4 = 80

However, this result, 80, doesn't make sense because it's more than the desired 20 pieces of pomelon Eve is left with. This indicates that there's a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's correct the mistake. Eve is left with 20 pieces of pomelon, which is 1/4 of the original number of pomelos. So, we have:

x/4 = 20

But we need to find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, not the original amount she had. If x/4 = 20, then x = 20 * 4 = 80. This means Eve originally had 80 pomelos.

After giving away some pomelos, she is left with 20 pomelos. So, the number of pomelos Eve gave away is:

                [/INST] To find out how old Jackson is, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the relationships between the kids' ages**:
   - Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
   - Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
   - James is 10 years old.
   - James is 1 year younger than Corey.

2. **Set up equations based on the information**:
   Let's denote Jackson's age as $J$. Therefore:
   - Amy's age can be represented as $J + 5$ (since she is 5 years older than Jackson).
   - Corey's age can be represented as $J + 5 + 2 \Rightarrow J + 7$ (since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey).
   - Since James is 1 year younger than Corey and he is 10 years old, we can find Corey's age: Corey = James + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11.

3. **Solve for Jackson's age**:
   Since we know Corey is 11 years old, and Corey's age is $J + 7$, we can set up the equation:
   \[ J + 7 = 11 \]
   Subtracting 7 from both sides gives:
   \[ J = 11 - 7 \]
   \[ J = 4 \]

So, **Jackson's age is 4 years**.

                    a customs officer at the main port of seaside clearances counted 2 containers of imported vehicles, each having 5 vehicles inside. the next day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. calculate the number of units that were imported on the second day, assuming all the containers contain 5 vehicles.
                [/INST] First, let's determine the total number of vehicles imported on the first day. We know that there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles.

Number of vehicles imported on the first day = Number of containers * Number of vehicles per container
= 2 * 5
= 10 vehicles

Next, let's find out how many vehicles were brought in on the second day. We know that the total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day.

Total number of vehicles after the second day = Number of vehicles after the first day + Number of vehicles brought in on the second day

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the number of vehicles brought in on the second day.

Number of vehicles brought in on the second day = Total number of vehicles after the second day - Number of vehicles after the first day

Number of vehicles after the first day = Number of vehicles imported on the first day = 10 (from the previous step)

Number of vehicles brought in on the second day = Total number of vehicles after the second day - Number of vehicles after the first day
= 30 - 10
= 20 vehicles

However, we are asked to find the number of containers, not the number of vehicles. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers by dividing the number of vehicles by the number of vehicles per container.

Number of containers = Number of vehicles / Number of vehicles per container
= 20 / 5
= 4 containers

So, the final answer is \boxed{4}.</s>",4.0

                [/INST] First, let's find out how much water Celine was able to collect from the rain. Since it's stated that she collected twice as much as what was left after she used 90 liters, we can calculate this as follows:

Liters of water collected from rain = Liters left after use * 2
= (120 - 90) * 2
= 30 * 2
= 60 liters

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water remaining in the tank after collecting the rainwater:

Total liters in the tank = Liters left after use + Liters collected from rain
= (120 - 90) + 60
= 30 + 60
= 90 liters

So, the tank now contains 90 liters of water.

2. He wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The difference between the desired amount and the current amount is:

Additional milk needed = Desired amount - Current amount
= 25 liters - 15 liters
= 10 liters

3. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, to produce an additional 10 liters of milk, he needs:

Number of additional cows = Additional milk needed / Milk produced by 1 cow

                    question:
                    a musician has 50 microphones that he wants to arrange in pairs on a stage. while making the arrangement, he realizes that 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. how many pairs of microphones was he able to arrange on the stage?
                [/INST] To find out how many pairs of microphones the musician was able to arrange on the stage, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of microphones that won't fit in:**
   The musician wants to arrange the microphones in pairs, but 20% of the microphones won't fit in. To find out how many microphones these represent, we calculate 20% of 50:
   \[
   0.20 \times 50 = 10
   \]
   So, 10 microphones won't fit in the arrangement.

2. **Calculate the number of microphones that will find a space to fit in:**
   Since 10 microphones won't fit, the number of microphones that will find a space to fit in is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 microphones will find a space to fit in.

3. **Calculate the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged:**
   Since the 40 microphones that find a space to fit in will be arranged in pairs, the number of pairs is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   Therefore, the musician was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

Hence, the final answer, clearly indicated as required, is:

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.

Total lollipops sold = Number of students * Lollipops per student
= 30 students * 10 lollipops
= 300 lollipops

Next, let's calculate the total cost of these lollipops for the students who bought them.

Total cost for students = Total lollipops sold * Cost per lollipop for students
= 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop

Then, let's calculate the total revenue from selling these lollipops.

Total revenue = Total lollipops sold * Cost per lollipop for customers
= 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

1. Adrianne's father gave her 20 metallic beads.

2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother. Let's denote the number of beads her mother gave as M. Then, her sister gave M + 10 beads.

3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, which is 2M beads.

4. To find out the total number of beads, we need to add up all the beads she received.

So, the total number of beads Adrianne had is:

Total beads = Beads from father + Beads from sister + Beads from friend
= 20 + (M + 10) + 2M

But we still don't know the exact number of beads her mother gave (M), so we cannot simplify this further.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate how many kilometers Bernice has walked per day.

Kilometers walked per day = Total kilometers walked / Number of days

Next, let's figure out how many days Bernice would need to walk the entire distance from San Diego to New York.

Number of days = Total distance / Kilometers walked per day
= 1955 kilometers / 81.25 kilometers per day
= approximately 24 days

Finally, to find out how many kilometers Bernice would still need to drive, we subtract the distance she has already walked from the total distance.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance walked
= 1955 kilometers - (81.25 kilometers per day * 4 days)

1. In the morning, 50 guests entered the restaurant.

2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant. So, the total number of people so far is 50 (from the morning) + 40 (from 10:00) = 90 people.

3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. So, 2 * 40 = 80 people entered at this time. Now, the total number of people in the restaurant is 90 (from before) + 80 (from this time) = 170 people.

4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (50 people) had entered the restaurant. So, 3 * 50 = 150 people came in by evening.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that Bernie owns 4 dogs and that on average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. This means the total distance that all four dogs walk per day is 4 times 3, which equals 12 miles.

2. We also know how much each of the first three dogs walks:
   - The first dog walks 1 mile.
   - The second dog walks 4 miles.
   - The third dog walks 3 miles.

3. If we add the distances that the first three dogs walk, we get 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

4. Since the total distance walked by all four dogs is 12 miles, and the first three dogs walk 8 miles, the fourth dog must walk the remaining distance to reach 12 miles.

                [/INST] Sure, I'd be happy to help with this problem. Here's how we can approach it:

1. First, let's calculate the total selling price of the watermelons. The farmer bought them for $80 and sold them for a profit of 25%. To find the profit in dollars, we calculate 25% of $80.

Profit = Total cost * Profit percentage
   = $80 * 0.25
   = $20

2. Next, we add the profit to the total cost to find the total selling price.

Total selling price = Total cost + Profit
   = $80 + $20
   = $100

3. Finally, to find the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons.

Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
   = $100 / 50
   = $2

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many pizzas in total they have. The problem states that Henry and his 3 friends have an average of 7 pizzas, so we multiply this number by the number of people to get the total number of pizzas.
   Total pizzas = Average pizzas * Number of people
   = 7 * 4
   = 28 pizzas

2. Next, we need to find out how many slices they have in total. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so we multiply the total number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza.
   Total slices = Total pizzas * Slices per pizza
   = 28 * 8
   = 224 slices

3. Finally, we need to find out how many slices each person can have. To do this, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people.

1. Jared's initial typing speed is 47 words per minute.
2. After some lessons, his typing speed increases to 52 words per minute.
3. He then increases his typing speed by another 5 words, so his new typing speed becomes 52 + 5 = 57 words per minute.

To find the average of these three measurements, we add them together and divide by the number of measurements:

1. First, we need to determine the total weight of the 8 adults. Since an adult generally weighs around 80 kg, the total weight of the 8 adults would be:
   8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg

2. Next, we compare this total weight to the maximum load the elevator can support, which is 700 kg.

3. To find out by how much they exceed the maximum load, we subtract the elevator's maximum capacity from the total weight of the 8 adults:
   700 kg (maximum load) - 640 kg (total weight of adults) = 60 kg

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks. Since two weeks have 14 days, and Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, the total amount of candy Ginger eats is:
   Ginger's consumption = daily consumption * number of days
   = 4 pieces * 14 days
   = 56 pieces

2. Similarly, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks. Since Amy eats 3 pieces a day, the total amount of candy Amy eats is:
   Amy's consumption = daily consumption * number of days
   = 3 pieces * 14 days
   = 42 pieces

3. Now, we subtract the amount of candy each person has eaten from their original amount to find out how much candy they have left.
   Ginger's remaining candy = initial amount - Ginger's consumption
   = 100 pieces - 56 pieces
   = 44 pieces

   Amy's remaining candy = initial amount - Amy's consumption
   = 100 pieces - 42 pieces
   = 58 pieces

4. Finally, we find the difference between the amount of candy Amy has and the amount Ginger has to see how much more candy Amy has.
   Difference = Amy's remaining candy - Ginger's remaining candy
   = 58 pieces - 44 pieces
   = 14 pieces

So, after two weeks, Amy has {14} more pieces of candy than Ginger.</s>",14.0

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. We know that Clara has 20 books.
2. Since Clara has twice as many books as Steven, we can say that Steven has 20/2 = 10 books.
3. Alice includes 6 more children than Steven, but in this case, it looks like the ""children"" part of the statement is a typo or a redundancy that isn't relevant to the problem of counting books. So, we should ignore that part and just focus on the number of books.
4. Therefore, Alice has the same number of books as Steven, which is 10 books.
5. To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has.

Alice's books - Clara's books = 10 - 20 = -10

However, since we're looking for how many more books Clara has, and her number is positive, we should take the absolute value of the result:

Number of more books Clara has = |-10| = 10

                    two cars are driving on a highway.  the first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour when the second car leaves it at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.  if both cars continue on the highway at the same speed, how many miles will separate them after 2 hours?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. The first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. After 2 hours, the distance it would have covered is calculated as speed multiplied by time. So, the first car would cover 60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles.

2. The second car leaves after the first car, but both are traveling on the same highway. When the second car starts, the first car is already 120 miles ahead.

3. The second car is traveling at an average speed of 70 miles per hour. After 2 hours, the second car would have covered 70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles.

4. However, since the first car had already covered 120 miles in those 2 hours, the second car is not catching up to the first car. Instead, the distance between them is increasing.

5. Therefore, to find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we add the distances covered by each car. That is, 140 miles (covered by the second car) + 120 miles (covered by the first car) = 260 miles.

So, the final answer is {The cars will be 260 miles apart after 2 hours}.</s>",20.0

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 12 * 4 = 48 inches high.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 48 * 10 = 480 inches high.

Now, to convert inches to feet, we know that 1 foot equals 12 inches. So, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out the total number of apples orderred by the school. We do this by adding the number of red apples to the number of green apples:
   Total apples = Red apples + Green apples
   = 42 + 7
   = 49

2. Next, we need to find out how many apples were actually used by the students. Since only 9 students wanted fruit, we multiply the number of students by the number of apples each student took:
   Apples used = Number of students * Apples per student
   Since it's not specified, we'll assume each student took one apple.
   = 9 * 1
   = 9

3. Finally, we find the number of extra apples by subtracting the number of apples used from the total number of apples:
   Extra apples = Total apples - Apples used
   = 49 - 9
   = 40

So, the cafeteria ended up with 40 extra apples. {The final answer is 40}.</s>",40.0

1. The national center lost a total of 41 Siamese cats + 28 house cats = 69 cats.
2. They then sold 15 cats.
3. So, the total number of cats they had after these events is the initial number minus the lost and sold cats. Since they lost 69 cats and sold 15, they have: 69 - 15 = 54 cats.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we calculate Edward's total earnings from cutting lawns in the spring and summer. Since he earned 2 dollars per month in the spring and there are 3 months in spring (March, April, and May), his earnings would be:

2*(3) = 6 dollars

2. Next, we add his earnings from the summer, which is 27 dollars. So, his total earnings would be:

6 + 27 = 33 dollars

3. Finally, we subtract the cost of buying supplies, which is 5 dollars. So, Edward's final amount would be:

33 - 5 = 28 dollars

Total apples = Red apples + Green apples
= 37 + 45
= 82

Next, since only 51 students wanted fruit, this means there are apple choices that have been made that didn't get picked up by the students.

So, the number of choices left for the cafeteria is the total number of apples ordered minus the number of students who wanted fruit.

Choices left = Total apples - Students who wanted fruit
= 82 - 51

However, the problem states that only 71 of these carrots were good. This means that the difference between the total number of carrots picked and the number of good carrots must be the number of bad carrots.

So, the number of bad carrots = Total number of carrots - Number of good carrots

                [/INST] The problem is asking us to find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, given that only 5 students took fruit, and the total number of apples was 21 (6 red apples and 15 green apples).

Step 1: Identify the total number of apples.
The total number of apples is the sum of the number of red apples and green apples, which is 6 + 15 = 21 apples.

Step 2: Determine how many apples were taken by the students.
Since only 5 students wanted fruit, and it's not specified how many apples each student took, we can only conclude that the cafeteria gave out at least 5 apples.

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples left over.
The number of apples left over is the total number of apples minus the number of apples taken by the students. Since we don't know exactly how many apples were taken by each student, we can only calculate the minimum number of apples left over. This would be if each student took only one apple. So, the cafeteria would have 21 - 5 = 16 apples left over.

{The final answer is 16 apples}

So, the cafeteria ended up with at least 16 extra apples, and this is the minimum number that could be considered ""extra"" given the information provided. If students took more than one apple each, the number of ""extra"" apples would be less.</s>",16.0

Step 2: Her sister's initial amount of candy.
   Her sister initially had 6 pieces of candy.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of candy they have together after switching.
   54 (Katie's candy) + 6 (Sister's candy) = 60 pieces

Step 4: Calculate the amount of candy they have left after eating 9 pieces.

1. Calculate the total number of files Haley had on her flash drive before deleting any. This is done by adding the number of music files to the number of video files:
\[27 \text{ (music files)} + 42 \text{ (video files)} = 69 \text{ (total files)}\]

2. Determine the number of files remaining after Haley deleted 11 of them. This involves subtracting the number of deleted files from the total number of files:

                [/INST] Sure, I can help with that. Let's break it down:

1. Start with the initial number of customers: 19.
2. Then, 14 customers leave, so we subtract 14 from 19: 19 - 14 = 5.
3. Finally, 36 new customers arrive, so we add 36 to the remaining 5: 5 + 36 = 41.

So, at the end of these transactions, the beach would have 41 customers.</s>",41.0

                [/INST] The problem can be broken down into steps:

1. tiffany started with an initial number of lives, which we don't know.
2. She lost 14 lives in a hard part of the game.
3. Then she gained 27 lives in the next level.

To solve the problem, we need to add and subtract the number of lives as described and find the total number of lives that Tiffany has at the end.

Let's denote the initial number of lives as X.

Then, after losing 14 lives, we have X - 14 lives.

After gaining 27 lives, we have (X - 14) + 27 lives.

Now, let's plug in the value of X from the problem. After losing 43 lives, we have X = 43.

So, after losing 14 lives, we have 43 - 14 = 29 lives.

And after gaining 27 lives in the next level, we have 29 + 27 = 56 lives.

Therefore, Tiffany would have \boxed{56} lives at the end of the game.</s>",56.0

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. The bakery prepared 42 different apples (let's assume these are for different students to have different options) and 7 green apples (which could be for one student or more, but they don't change the total count initially).

2. Only 9 students wanted fruit.

3. If each student took one apple, 9 apples were taken (one per student). So, 9 apples were given to students.

4. The bakery prepared 42 apples. After giving 9 to students, 42 - 9 = 33 apples are left.

5. Now, we need to consider the extra green apples, which add to the total extra. Since there are still 7 green apples after assuming one student took them (or more if they were distributed), we add these to the extra.

6. Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 33 regular apples + 7 green apples = 40 extra apples.

So, the final answer is {40 extra apples}.</s>",40.0

Carol picked 16 carrots, and together with her mother, they picked a total of 16 + (Carol's mother's number of carrots) = 16 + 29 = 45 carrots.

Step 2: Determine the number of bad carrots.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to find out the total number of items Oliver had and then determine how many of them he did not wash before school started.

Step 1: Identify the total number of items.
Oliver had a total of 39 longer button blue shirts and 47 club ranking trousers. To find the total number of items, we need to add these two numbers together:

Total items = Number of shirts + Number of trousers
= 39 + 47
= 86 items

Step 2: Identify the number of items washed.
Oliver washed 20 of these items by the time school started.

Step 3: Calculate the number of items not washed.
To find out how many items Oliver did not wash, we subtract the number of items washed from the total number of items:

Items not washed = Total items - Items washed
= 86 - 20
= 66 items

                [/INST] The problem is as follows:

Bianca, who is 26 years old, and her mother picked 15 carrots. If only 16 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they make?

To solve this problem, we need to understand that the number of bad carrots is the total number of carrots picked minus the number of good carrots.

Step 1: Identify the total number of carrots picked.
In this case, the total number of carrots picked is not provided. However, we know that Bianca and her mother picked 15 carrots together.

Step 2: Identify the number of good carrots.
The problem states that only 16 of the carrots were good.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bad carrots.
The number of bad carrots is the total number of carrots picked minus the number of good carrots. However, we don't have the total number of carrots picked, only the number of carrots picked together by Bianca and her mother, which is 15. This means the total number of carrots picked could be more than 15, but we don't have enough information to determine this.

Without the total number of carrots picked, we cannot determine the exact number of bad carrots.

Therefore, the final answer cannot be determined due to lack of information. {The final answer is cannot be determined}</s>",25.0

1. First, let's identify the total number of pastries Deke and Katie made. They baked 7 cupcakes and 5 cookies, so the total number of pastries they made is 7 + 5 = 12 pastries.

2. After the sale, they had 8 pastries left to take back home. This means that they sold some of their pastries.

3. To find out how many pastries they sold, we subtract the number of pastries they took back home from the total number of pastries they made. So, 12 - 8 = 4 pastries.

1. The cafeteria initially has 43 gray vegetables and 32 green apples, making a total of 75 items (43 + 32 = 75).

2. Only 2 students wanted fruit, which means they could only eat a maximum of 2 fruits in total.

3. The cafeteria still has 43 gray vegetables that these 2 students can eat, but they cannot eat the 32 green apples since only 2 students wanted fruit.

4. Therefore, the cafeteria ends up with 30 extra items, which includes 43 gray vegetables and 32 green apples.

                [/INST] The problem involves two types of fruits: gray flowers and green apples. The cafeteria prepared 33 gray flowers and 23 green apples, but only 21 students wanted fruit. We need to find out how many extra fruits the cafeteria ended up with.

Since the question doesn't specify which type of fruit the students wanted and the cafeteria prepared more than enough fruit for the students, we'll consider the total number of fruits the cafeteria prepared.

1. First, let's add the total number of gray flowers and green apples to get the total number of fruits:
   33 (gray flowers) + 23 (green apples) = 56 (total fruits)

2. Then, we compare the total number of fruits with the number of fruits that students wanted. If 21 students wanted fruit, that means 21 fruits were taken by the students.

3. Therefore, to find the number of extra fruits, we subtract the number of fruits taken by the students from the total number of fruits:
   E = 56 (total fruits) - 21 (fruits taken by students)

4. After calculation, we get:
   E = 35 (extra fruits)

So, the cafeteria ended up with 35 extra fruits.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many total carrots Vanessa and her mother picked. We know that they picked 14 carrots together. This is a total, so it includes both good and bad carrots.

The next piece of information given is that only 24 of the carrots were good. This means that the remaining carrots are bad.

So, to find out how many bad carrots they had, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots they picked:

Bad Carrots = Total Carrots - Good Carrots
= 14 - 24

However, we see that the number of good carrots (24) is greater than the total number of carrots they picked (14). This indicates that there might be a mistake in the question, as it's not possible to have more good carrots than the total number of carrots picked.

Assuming the question meant to say that 14 was the number of carrots Vanessa and her mother picked in total, and among them, 24 were good, then we would have a negative number of bad carrots, which doesn't make sense.

1. First, Edward spent $2 dollars on lawn maintenance in the spring.
2. Then, he earned $27 dollars in the summer.
3. After earning money, he had to spend $5 dollars on supplies.

So, to find out how much money he ended up with, we need to subtract his spending from his earnings.

Step 1: Subtract the cost of lawn maintenance from the money he made:

$27 (money made) - $2 (cost of lawn maintenance) = $25

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. The local website said there are 6 red apples and 15 green apples available for the students lunches. This means there are a total of 6 + 15 = 21 apples.

2. Only 5 students wanted fruit.

3. If we assume that each student took only one apple, the cafeteria would have given away 5 apples, which means they would have 21 - 5 = 16 apples left.

4. However, the question doesn't specify whether the students took one or each type of apple. If we assume that each student took one apple of each type, then the cafeteria would have given away 5 * (6 + 15) / 2 = 21 apples, because 6 and 15 are the quantities of the two types of apples, and there are 5 students. In this case, the cafeteria would have none left, or {No extra}.

5. On the other hand, if we assume that the students took the same type of apples, the cafeteria would have given away 5 * 6 = 30 apples if all were red, or 5 * 15 = 75 apples if all were green. This would mean the cafeteria would have ended up with 21 - 30 = -9 extra apples if all the students took red apples, or 21 - 75 = -54 extra apples if all the students took green apples. However, since the cafeteria can't have negative apples, this scenario is impossible.

{The final answer is \boxed{No extra}}

Please note that this solution assumes a specific interpretation of the problem, as the problem statement is somewhat ambiguous. The final answer is ""No extra"" based on the assumption that each student took one apple of each type or that the students took all the same type of apples. If the students took 6 red apples, then 15 green apples would be left, or if they took 15 green apples, then 6 red apples would be left. In both cases, there would be as many ""extra"" apples as the number of apples of the remaining type.</s>",16.0

                [/INST] The first step is to determine the total number of fresh fruits (poppy flowers and yellow apples) the chef prepared for the students' lunches. To do this, we add the number of poppy flowers and yellow apples:

25 poppy flowers + 17 yellow apples = 42 fresh fruits

Next, we need to determine how many pieces of fruit each student gets if only 10 students want fruit. To do this, we divide the total number of fresh fruits by the number of students:

42 fresh fruits / 10 students = 4.2 fresh fruits per student

Since students can only get whole fresh fruits, and there can't be a fraction of a student, some fresh fruits will be leftover. We know that 10 students will get 42 / 10 = 4.2 which we round down to 4 fresh fruits each, leaving us with:

10 students * 4 fresh fruits/student = 40 fresh fruits

So now we can subtract the fruits given away from the original amount to find out how many extras:

42 fresh fruits - 40 fresh fruits = 2 extra fresh fruits

Therefore, the cafeteria ends up with 2 extra fresh fruits. {The final answer is 2 extra fresh fruits.}</s>",32.0

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Edward initially made 43 books.
2. He then destroyed 19 of them. So, we subtract the destroyed books from the total:
   Books left = Initial books - Destroyed books
   = 43 - 19
   = 24 books

3. Then, he used the material from the destroyed books to make 14 new books. So, we add these new books to the ones he still has left:
   Total books = Books left - Destroyed books + New books
   = 24 - 19 + 14

   = 19 books

So, after all these events, Edward would have 19 books. {The final answer is 19 books.}</s>",38.0

                [/INST] The problem involves two main steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of worksheets she initially had to grade. In this case, that's 29.

Step 2: Subtract the number of worksheets she already graded (25) from the original number (29).

So, 29 - 25 = 4

This means she would still have 4 worksheets to grade.

However, then another 29 worksheets were turned in. This means she now has 4 (the remaining ones from before) + 29 (the new ones) = 33 worksheets to grade.

                [/INST] First, we need to find out how many carrots Carol and her uncle picked together. Carol picked 29 carrots and her uncle picked 16 carrots. So, they picked a total of 29 + 16 = 45 carrots.

Then, we know that out of these 45 carrots, only 38 were good. So, to find out how many bad carrots they had, we subtract the good carrots from the total carrots. That is, 45 - 38 = 7 bad carrots.

So, the final answer is \boxed{7}.</s>",7.0

                [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that Bianca and her daughter picked 15 carrots and 16 of them were good. We need to find out how many bad carrots they had.

Step 2: Determine if there was any additional information about the number of bad carrots.
The problem doesn't provide any direct information about the number of bad carrots. However, it states that only 16 of the carrots were good. This implies that the remaining carrots were bad.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bad carrots
Since Bianca and her daughter picked 15 carrots and 16 of them were good, we can subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots to find the number of bad carrots.

Number of bad carrots = Total number of carrots - Number of good carrots
= 15 - 16
= -1

Step 4: Interpret the result
The result is negative because we subtracted a larger number from a smaller number. This indicates that there was an error in the problem statement, as it's not possible to have a negative number of bad carrots.

The final answer is:
\boxed{-1}

However, considering the problem statement and the given context, the problem is not correctly formulated. They couldn't have picked more good carrots than the total number they picked.</s>",25.0

                [/INST] Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the total number of pastries Katie had at the start of the sale. She baked 7 cupcakes and 5 cookies, so the total number of pastries is 7 + 5 = 12 pastries.

2. After the sale, Katie had 8 pastries to take back home. This means that the number of pastries she sold is the difference between the total number of pastries she had at the start and the number she took back home.

3. To find the number of pastries sold, we subtract the number of pastries she took back home from the total number of pastries she had at the start: 12 - 8 = 4 pastries.

So, Katie sold {4 pastries}.</s>",4.0

                [/INST] First, let's find out how many apples were given out to the students who wanted them.
The number of students who wanted fruit = 2
The total number of apples = 43 red apples + 32 green apples = 75 apples

Since only 2 students wanted fruit, the cafeteria gave out 2 apples.

Next, we need to find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with. To do this, subtract the number of apples given out from the total number of apples.

The number of extra apples = Total number of apples - Number of apples given out
= 75 apples - 2 apples
= 73 apples

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with \boxed{73} extra apples.</s>",73.0

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we first need to find out the total number of carrots they picked. Then, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots to find out the number of bad carrots.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of carrots they picked.
Haley and her mother picked 39 and 38 carrots respectively. So, the total number of carrots they picked is 39 + 38 = 77 carrots.

Step 2: Find out the number of bad carrots.
They only had 64 good carrots. So, the number of bad carrots is the total number of carrots minus the number of good carrots, which is 77 - 64 = 13 bad carrots.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, let's find out the total number of apples the cafeteria had initially. They had 6 red apples and 15 green apples. So, the total number of apples was 6 + 15 = 21 apples.

2. Then, we know that only 5 students wanted fruit, and since the question implies each student took one apple (as it's not specified otherwise), 5 students took 5 apples in total.

3. Next, we subtract the number of apples taken by the students from the initial total to find out how many apples the cafeteria ended up with. So, 21 apples - 5 apples taken by students = 16 apples.
