                    question:
                    A ? robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber ! and half that much ? white ! fiber.  ; How , many bolts in total does it take?
                [/INST] Sure, I'd be happy to help with this. Let's break it down:

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Let's call this amount B.
2. It also takes half that much white fiber. Since the amount of white fiber is half of the blue fiber, we can represent it as B/2.
3. To find the total amount of bolts needed, we simply add the amounts of the two types of fiber together.

So, if B represents the bolts of blue fiber, then the total amount of bolts for the robe is B + B/2.

Now, to find the total bolts, we need to know the value of B. Since it's not provided in the question, we can't calculate a specific number of bolts. But we can express the total number of bolts in terms of B:

Total bolts = B + B/2 = (2B + B) / 2 = 3B/2

Without a specific value for B, we can't give a numerical answer, but the total number of bolts is expressed as 3B/2.

{The final answer is 3B/2 }</s>",3,3.0,2.0

                    question:
                    John takes care : of 10 dogs.  Each ; dog takes .5 hours a day to walk and , take ! care . of their business.  How : many . hours a week does he spend : taking ! care ? of dogs?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to calculate the time spent on walking each dog. Since each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk, and John takes care of 10 dogs, the total time spent on walking dogs each day is:

Daily walking time = Time per dog * Number of dogs
    = 0.5 hours * 10 dogs
    = 5 hours

2. Next, we need to consider the time spent on 'taking care of their business'. It's not specified how long this takes, so let's assume it takes the same amount of time as walking, i.e., 0.5 hours per dog. Then, the total time spent on 'taking care of their business' each day is:

Daily 'business care' time = Time per dog * Number of dogs
    = 0.5 hours * 10 dogs
    = 5 hours

3. Adding these two times together gives us the total daily time spent on taking care of dogs:

Total daily time = Daily walking time + Daily 'business care' time
    = 5 hours + 5 hours
    = 10 hours

4. Finally, to find the total weekly time spent on taking care of dogs, we multiply this daily time by the number of days in a week, which is 7:

Total weekly time = Total daily time * Days per week
    = 10 hours * 7 days
    = 70 hours

So, the final answer is:

\boxed{70} hours a week does he spend on taking care of dogs.</s>",35,35.0,70.0

                [/INST] Tracy used a 4 feet long wire to support tomato plants. The wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces she obtained, we first need to convert the wire length from feet to inches. We know that there are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now that the wire length is in inches, we can divide it by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained. So, 48 inches / 6 inches = 8 pieces.

Therefore, Tracy obtained {8} pieces of wire.</s>",8,8.0,8.0

                [/INST] Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many roses there are in total. Dan plants 3 rose bushes and each bush has 25 roses. So, the total number of roses is:
   Total roses = Number of rose bushes * Roses per bush
   = 3 * 25
   = 75 roses

2. Next, we need to find out how many thorns there are in total. Each rose has 8 thorns. So, the total number of thorns is:
   Total thorns = Total roses * Thorns per rose
   = 75 * 8
   = 600 thorns

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Harry slept 9 hours.
2. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept. So, to find out how many hours James slept, we multiply Harry's sleep hours by 2/3.
   James' sleep hours = Harry's sleep hours * 2/3
   = 9 hours * 2/3
   = 2/3 * 9
   = 6 hours

3. Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James' sleep hours from Harry's sleep hours.
   Difference in sleep hours = Harry's sleep hours - James' sleep hours
   = 9 hours - 6 hours
   = 3 hours

So, the final answer is {Harry slept 3 more hours than James}.</s>",3,3.0,3.0

If the : whiteboard ! is cleaned ? 3 . times per lesson, how many times . is : the whiteboard cleaned , in a day?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we can break it down into simpler steps:

1. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
2. Each lesson uses the whiteboard once.
3. The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

First, we calculate the total number of times the whiteboard is used in a day:
Since there are 4 teachers and each teacher has 2 lessons per day, the total number of lessons (and thus the total number of times the whiteboard is used) is 4 teachers * 2 lessons/teacher = 8 lessons.

Next, we calculate the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned:
Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 lessons * 3 cleanings/lesson = 24 cleanings.

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned {24 times} in a day.</s>",24,24.0,24.0

                [/INST] Sure, let's break it down:

1. Ryan plants 2 flowers each day.

2. Over 15 days, the total number of flowers he planted would be:
   Flowers planted = Number of days * Flowers planted per day
                   = 15 days * 2 flowers/day
                   = 30 flowers

3. However, 5 flowers did not grow, so we need to subtract these from the total:
   Total flowers Ryan has = Flowers planted - Flowers that did not grow
                           = 30 flowers - 5 flowers
                           = 25 flowers

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than it did on Monday. So, the depth of the tank on Tuesday is:

Depth on Tuesday = Depth on Monday + Additional water
= 17 feet + 7 feet
= 24 feet

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, the depth of the tank on Wednesday is:

Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * Depth on Tuesday

1. The company spends $15,000 on advertising for the first year.
2. The company spends a third of that amount on advertising for the second year.

To find the advertising budget for the second year, we calculate one third of $15,000:
$15,000 / 3 = $5,000

Now, to find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we add the budgets for both years:
$15,000 (first year) + $5,000 (second year) = $20,000

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we'll break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total number of slices needed**: Since John wants each of his 20 friends to have 4 slices, we first calculate the total number of slices required. This is done by multiplying the number of friends by the number of slices per friend.
   \[
   \text{Total slices needed} = 20 \times 4 = 80
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of pizzas needed**: Given that each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, we can find out how many pizzas are needed by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza.
   \[
   \text{Number of pizzas} = \frac{\text{Total slices needed}}{\text{Slices per pizza}} = \frac{80}{8} = 10

                [/INST] Sure, I understand the problem is missing some symbols, but let's try to solve it step by step.

Step 1: Identify the missing symbols
The problem is missing the following symbols:
```
- What did Ray do with the lollipops (gave away, kept, shared, etc.)
- How many lollipops did each friend receive
```

Step 2: Interpret the missing information
Assuming that the question is asking how many lollipops each friend received if Ray kept 5 lollipops and shared the rest with his four friends, we can start solving the problem.

Step 3: Subtract the number of lollips Ray kept from the total number of lollips
```
25 - 5 = 20 lollipops
```
This means 20 lollipops were shared with his four friends.

Step 4: Divide the total number of lollipops shared by the number of friends
```
20 / 4 = 5 lollipops per friend

                [/INST] To calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we first need to determine how many oranges he ate. According to the problem, Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked. Since they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges Stetson ate as follows:

Number of oranges Stetson ate = (2/5) * Total number of oranges picked
                                         = (2/5) * 60
                                         = 24 oranges

Now that we know Stetson ate 24 oranges, we can calculate the total amount of money he gave up by multiplying the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up for each orange. According to the problem, Stetson gave up $10 for each orange.

Total amount of money given up = Number of oranges eaten * Amount given up per orange
                                           = 24 * $10
                                           = $240

1. First, we know that Brett is currently 14 years old.

2. We are told that after four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, in four years, Angela will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

3. But this is Angela's age in four years, not her current age. To find Angela's current age, we need to subtract four years from the age she will be in four years. So, Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years.

One round trip = Two sides of the equation (to work and back home)

So, one round trip = 3 miles * 2 = 6 miles

Next, let's find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week.
Number of weeks = 1 (since the question doesn't specify for how many weeks he works)

Number of times he works in a week = 5 (given in the question)

Number of miles he walks in a week = Number of times he works * miles per round trip

1. First, let's determine how many cards the brother has. As stated, the boy has 5 cards, and his brother has 3 fewer cards. So, we subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has:

   Cards with brother = Cards with boy - 3
   = 5 - 3
   = 2

2. Now that we know how many cards each of them has, we can calculate how many cards they have together by adding the number of cards each of them has:

   Total cards = Cards with boy + Cards with brother
   = 5 + 2
   = 7

So, the boy and his brother have 7 cards together. Therefore,

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. So, the speed is:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles/hour

Now, we want to find out how many hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

                [/INST] First, let's break down the problem:
1. There are 100 surfers in total.
2. When a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright.
3. Of these riders, 60% are women.

First, we need to find out how many surfers can stay upright during a big wave. To do this, we calculate 25% of the total number of surfers:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 surfers

So, 25 surfers can stay upright during a big wave.

Next, we need to find out how many of these staying-upright surfers are women. We do this by calculating 60% of the 25 surfers:

60% of 25 = 0.60 * 25 = 15 women

So, 15 of the surfers staying upright during a big wave are women.

Finally, to find out how many men can stay upright on the wave, we subtract the number of women from the total number of surfers who can stay upright:

Total candy = 3 pounds + 5 pounds + 4 pounds
Total candy = 12 pounds

Step 2: Divide the total amount of candy by the number of people to find out how much candy each person would get if they share their candy equally.

Money raised per hour = Total money raised / Number of hours

Next, we need to determine how many more hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal of $6300. We can do this by dividing the remaining amount they need to raise by the amount they raise per hour:

Remaining hours = (Total goal - Money already raised) / Money raised per hour

1. **Understanding the problem**: Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days. Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks each day.

2. **Calculating Sofie's total distance**: Sofie walks 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, her total distance walked is calculated as:

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Ara joined the basketball team four years ago. This means she has been playing for four years.

2. She has been playing 40 games every year. So, the total number of games she has played in four years is:
   Total games = Games per year * Number of years
   = 40 games/year * 4 years
   = 160 games

3. If her score for every game is 21 points, then the total number of points she has scored in four years is:
   Total points = Score per game * Total games
   = 21 points/game * 160 games
   = 3360 points

So, the final answer is:

1. Jade wants to upload all her photos on her Instagram.
2. She takes 7 photos in one batch.
3. She uploads 6 batches each day.

So, to find out how many batches she has in total:
Total batches = Total photos / Photos per batch
Total batches = 210 / 7
Total batches = 30

Now, to find out how many days she will need to upload all her photos:

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem:

1. Initially, it's given that Steve took 10! hours to complete the puzzle. 10! is the factorial of 10, which equals 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 3,628,800 hours. However, since the result is not realistic in practical time, we'd assume the reference indicates it was ""10"" hours, not ""10!"". So, Steve took 10 hours.

2. Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time to complete the puzzle. Half of Steve's time is 10/2 = 5 hours.

3. Adding 2 hours to Anna's half-time equals 5 + 2 = 7 hours.

1. The caretaker wants to have 3 feet of line for every 1 foot of dock.
2. Right now, there are 200 feet of dock.
3. He already has 6 feet of new line.

To find out how many feet of line he needs to buy in total, we first need to calculate how much line he needs for the existing dock:

Line needed = Line per foot of dock * Length of dock
= 3 feet * 200 feet
= 600 feet

However, he already has 6 feet of new line. So, the additional line he needs to buy is:

Additional line needed = Total line needed - Line he already has
= 600 feet - 6 feet
= 594 feet

Since he needs to buy new line, the answer is 594 feet.

- Amy = A
- Jackson = J
- Corey = C
- James = M

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: A = C - 2
3. James is 10 years old: M = 10
4. James is 1 year younger than Corey: C = M + 1

We can substitute equation 4 into equation 3 to find the age of Corey:
C = 10 + 1
C = 11

Now we can substitute the value of C into equation 2 to find the age of Amy:

1. We start with 2 containers on the first day, each containing 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles.

2. On the second day, the total number of vehicles becomes 30. We already had 10 vehicles from the first day, so the number of vehicles added on the second day is 30 total vehicles - 10 vehicles from the first day = 20 vehicles.

3. We're told that all containers still contain 5 vehicles. So, to find out how many containers were imported on the second day, we divide the number of vehicles imported on the second day by the number of vehicles per container. That is, 20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers.

Step 1: Find the number of semi-automatic cars.
Subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.
20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 semi-automatic cars

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars.
Divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

1. The tank initially has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank, which leaves:
   120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters
3. After using 90 liters, Celine collects rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank.
4. To find out how much rainwater is collected, we need to multiply the remaining water in the tank by 2:
   30 liters * 2 = 60 liters
5. Now, Celine has collected 60 liters of rainwater and used 90 liters of water from the tank. So, the total amount of water she had was:
   60 liters (rainwater) + 90 liters (water from tank) = 150 liters
6. To find out how much water is left in the tank now, we need to subtract the amount of water Celine used and the rainwater she collected from the total amount of water:

1. First, we know that John has 54 candies.

2. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can find out how many candies Robert has by dividing the number of candies John has by 2. So, Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

3. Now, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has 27 (Robert's candies) + 6 = 33 candies.

4. To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has. So, John has 54 (his candies) - 33 (James's candies) = 21 more candies.

She has saved $2 from her ; allowance, and her mother , gave her : $16. How ; much more money does . Dora need ! to buy . the skipping rope, the , game, and : the ball?
                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy. The skipping rope costs $6, the ? board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, the total cost is:
   $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

2. Next, let's see how much money Dora already has. She has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. So, the total amount of money she has is:
   $2 + $16 = $18

3. Now, let's compare the total cost of the items with the total amount of money Dora has. If Dora has more money than the total cost, she doesn't need more money. If the total cost is more than the amount of money she has, then that's how much more money she needs. In this case, Dora has $18 and the total cost is $19. So, Dora needs:
   $19 - $18 = $1 more money

So, the final answer is Dora needs $1 more money to buy the skipping rope, the ? board game, and the ball.</s>",1,1.0,1.0

1. Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

2. After twenty minutes, a friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn did. Since this number is not specified, let's call it X. So, the number of fairies became 50 + X.

3. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, so the number of fairies left would be (50 + X) - 30.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step.

1. We know that Paul drives twice a day and he has been doing this for 14 days. So, the total number of trips he has made are:
   Total trips = Trips per day * Number of days
   = 2 * 14
   = 28

2. Next, we need to find out how much money he spends on these trips. We know that each morning ride costs him $6 and each afternoon ride costs him $2. So, his total spending per day would be:
   Spending per day = (Cost of morning ride + Cost of afternoon ride)
   = $6 + $2
   = $8

3. Finally, to find out how much money he spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we multiply his spending per day by the total number of days:

2. 2 of her friends want 5 gifts each. So, the total number of gifts for these two friends is 2 * 5 = 10 gifts.
3. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each. So, the total number of gifts for these three friends is 3 * 2 = 6 gifts.
4. Cherrie buys these gifts, so she has bought a total of 10 (for the first two friends) + 6 (for the next three friends) = 16 gifts.
5. Cherrie decides to further surprise them by getting 10 more random gifts.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row. Therefore, the number of rows of red tulips he can plant is the total number of red tulips divided by the number of tulips per row. In this case, that's 36 red tulips divided by 6 tulips per row.

2. Jackson can also fit 8 blue tulips in a row. Therefore, the number of rows of blue tulips he can plant is the total number of blue tulips divided by the number of tulips per row. In this case, that's 24 blue tulips divided by 8 tulips per row.

3. The total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant is the sum of the number of rows of red tulips and the number of rows of blue tulips.

Let's calculate:

1. Number of rows of red tulips = 36 red tulips / 6 tulips per row = 6 rows

2. Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 blue tulips / 8 tulips per row = 3 rows

3. Total number of rows of flowers = 6 rows (red tulips) + 3 rows (blue tulips) = 9 rows

                [/INST] First, let's think about the situation in 7 years. Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So if we denote Shiloh's nephew's age in 7 years as x, we can write:

44 + 7 = 3x

Now, let's solve for x:

51 = 3x
x = 51 / 3
x = 17

So, Shiloh's nephew will be 17 years old in 7 years.

At the end of the line sat a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon. How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?""

Here's how to solve it:

1. We start by finding the weight of the Dachshund. The problem states that the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, which we know weighs 10 pounds. So, the Dachshund weighs 10 * 2 = 20 pounds.

2. Next, we find the weight of the Papillon. The problem states that the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, which we know weighs 20 pounds. So, the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

3. Finally, we find the weight of the Mastiff. The problem states that the Mastiff weighs 44 times as much as the Papillon, which we know weighs 5 pounds. So, the Mastiff weighs 5 * 44 = 220 pounds.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. First, we determine the temperature change needed to prevent the pipes from freezing. Since the pipes will freeze when the temperature drops below 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house above this point. So, the temperature change required is 32 - 45 = -13 degrees. However, since the question asks for the number of logs needed to raise the temperature, our target temperature should be 32 degrees, which is the point at which the pipes would just start to freeze.

2. Next, we need to figure out how much of this temperature change occurs naturally during the day. If the house stays at 45 degrees during the day and the temperature drops by 33 degrees during the night, the house would normally drop to 45 - 33 = 12 degrees during the night.

3. Since we want to prevent the temperature from falling below 32 degrees, Carson needs to make up the difference between the natural drop and the target temperature. This is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

4. Finally, we determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to achieve this temperature change. Since every log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, Carson needs to burn enough logs to raise the temperature by 20 degrees. Therefore, he needs 20 / 5 = 4 logs.

Therefore, the final answer is {Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing}.</s>",4,4.0,4.0

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the discount on the jeans**: The jeans are advertised at a 25% discount, and the original price is $40. The discount amount is calculated as a percentage of the original price.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = \frac{25}{100} \times 40 = 10
   \]
   This means the discount is $10.

2. **Determine the price of the jeans after the discount**: To find the price after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original price.
   \[
   \text{Price after discount} = 40 - 10 = 30
   \]
   So, the price of the jeans after the discount is $30.

3. **Calculate the money Mike will have left after payment**: Mike pays with a $50 bill, and the price of the jeans after the discount is $30. To find out how much money Mike will have left, we subtract the price of the jeans from the amount he is paying with.
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]
   Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after paying for the jeans.

1. The first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
2. The second car is traveling at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
3. If both cars continue on the highway at the same speed, we need to find out how far each car will travel in 2 hours.
4. The distance traveled by a car is equal to its speed multiplied by the time traveled.
5. For the first car: Distance = Speed * Time
- Distance_1 = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

For the second car: Distance = Speed * Time
- Distance_2 = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

Now, since both cars start from the same point and continue on the highway at the same time, the distance between them after 2 hours is:
- Distance_between_cars = Distance_2 - Distance_1
- Distance_between_cars = 140 miles - 120 miles

                    ! Kimberly bought . 8 packages of cat : food and . 6 packages of dog , food. Each package of cat food contained 11 tins, and , each package of ? dog food contained 6 tins. ! How ! many more tins of , cat food . than dog food did Kimberly ? buy?
                [/INST] Based on the given information, we can calculate the number of tins of cat food and dog food that Kimberly bought.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food bought by Kimberly. She bought 0.8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is 0.8 * 11 = 8.8 tins.

2. Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food bought by Kimberly. She bought 0.6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is 0.6 * 6 = 3.6 tins.

3. Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food. So, the difference is 8.8 - 3.6 = 5.2 tins.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Naruto.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Kagiyami.
3. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
4. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

First, let's find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain. Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, and Pompei can lift it 1 inch, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.

Now, let's find out how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain. Since Saskay can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Kagiyami, and Saskay can lift it 12 inches, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 12 / 4 = 3 inches high.

Finally, let's find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain. Since Kagiyami can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Naruto, and Kagiyami can lift it 3 inches, Naruto can lift a mountain 3 / 10 inches high.

To convert inches to feet, we know that 1 foot is 12 inches. So, Naruto can lift a mountain 3 / 10 inches * 1 foot / 12 inches = 0.025 feet high.

1. First, we need to find out how much milk one cow produces a day. Since one cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we know that each cow is already contributing 5 liters to the total milk production.
2. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. He currently has 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk, so he currently produces 3 * 5 = 15 liters of milk a day.
3. He wants to produce 25 liters of milk and currently produces 15 liters, so the difference is 25 - 15 = 10 liters.
4. Since he needs to produce these extra 10 liters of milk and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, he needs an additional 10 / 5 = 2 cows.

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. {The final answer is 2 more cows.}</s>",2,2.0,2.0

1. First, we need to find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and he plans to sell 3/5 of them. So, we calculate 3/5 of 300, which is (3/5)*300 = 180 chickens.

2. Next, we need to find out how much money Isaias will get from selling these 180 chickens. Since he sells each chicken for $50, the total money he gets is 180 * $50 = $9000.

3. Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000 from selling these chickens. So, the amount he spent on buying these chickens is the total money he got from selling them minus his profit. That is, $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

4. Finally, to find out how much each chicken cost him, we divide the total amount he spent on buying them by the number of chickens. That is, $7000 / 180 = $38.89 (rounded to two decimal places).

So, Isaias bought each chicken for $38.89 (rounded to two decimal places).

1. First, we need to find out the total distance between San Diego, California and New York City, New York. It is given that it is approximately 1955 kilometers. However, the question marks the distance with ""?"", so we can assume it is correct. But for the sake of clarity, let's denote the distance from San Diego to New York as D.

2. Next, we need to calculate the distance Bernice has already covered during her 4-day drive. She drove 0.325 kilometers per day. So, the total distance she covered is 0.325 kilometers/day * 4 days = 1.3 kilometers.

3. Finally, to find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already covered from the total distance. So, the distance left is D - 1.3 kilometers. Given that D = 1955 kilometers, the distance left is 1955 kilometers - 1.3 kilometers = 1953.7 kilometers.

                [/INST] Mr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks for delivery on a particular day. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.

The total amount of fertiliser dispatched was 20 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 400 tons.

Two hours after the trucks had departed, Mr. Hezekiah got the news that a quarter of the number of trucks dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures on the road and could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers.

So, the number of trucks that could not deliver was 1/4 * 20 trucks = 5 trucks.

The total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day was the total amount dispatched minus the amount lost due to mechanical failures.

The amount lost due to mechanical failures was 5 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 100 tons.

So, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day was 400 tons - 100 tons = 300 tons.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the information given and calculate step by step:

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog.
   Given that Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds, so Elijah's first dog weighs 60/4 = 15 pounds.

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog.
   So, Elijah's second dog weighs 60/2 = 30 pounds.

3. Now, to find the total weight of both Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog, we add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog.
   That is, 15 pounds (Elijah's first dog) + 30 pounds (Elijah's second dog) + 60 pounds (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate how many carrots Mason eats on weekdays. Since there are 5 weekdays and he eats 4 carrots each day, we multiply 4 by 5:

 Carrots on weekdays = Carrots per weekday * Number of weekdays
 = 4 * 5
 = 20

2. Next, let's calculate how many carrots he eats on Saturday and Sunday. He eats 5 carrots each day, and there are 2 days, so we multiply 5 by 2:

 Carrots on weekends = Carrots per weekend day * Number of weekend days
 = 5 * 2
 = 10

3. Finally, to find out how many carrots he eats in a week, we add the number of carrots he eats on weekdays to the number of carrots he eats on weekends:

 Total carrots = Carrots on weekdays + Carrots on weekends
 = 20 + 10
 = 30

So, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. John arm wrestles with 20 people. This is the total number of people he has faced.
2. He beats 80% of them. So, 20% of the people he faces he loses to.
3. To find out how many people he loses to, we calculate 20% of the total number of people he faces.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we follow the information given and apply the relationships between the costs of the items.

1. We are told that a magazine costs half as much as a book. Given that the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of a magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of a book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \, \text{dollars} \]

2. Next, we are informed that a pen costs $1 less than a magazine. Since we've found that a magazine costs $2, we can find the cost of the pen by subtracting $1 from the cost of the magazine:
\[ \text{Cost of a pen} = \text{Cost of a magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \, \text{dollar} \]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is \(\boxed{1}\) dollar.</s>",1,1.0,1.0

1. The company bought $400,000 worth of equipment.
2. 40% of the equipment were faulty, which means 60% of the equipment were functioning.
3. To calculate the cost of the functioning equipment, we need to find 60% of the total cost.

The calculation would be:

Total cost = $400,000
Percentage of functioning equipment = 60% = 0.6

Cost of functioning equipment = Total cost * Percentage of functioning equipment

Next, we know that Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. To find out how many days it will take him to finish, we divide the total number of pages he has to read by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

So, 66.67 pages / 10 pages per day = 6.67 days.

Since Mike can't read for a fraction of a day, we'll round up to the nearest whole number.

2. The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

3. The sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip.

First, let's find out how many trips the sloth makes in 8 hours:

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

So, the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours.

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth can pick up in one trip if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours:

                [/INST] To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Charleston**: Given that Charleston has $4$ times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has $20$ sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:
   \[
   \text{Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ sheep}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse**: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, the number of sheep in Toulouse can be calculated by:
   \[
   \text{Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ sheep}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle**: To find the total, we add the number of sheep in each city:
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Toulouse} + \text{Charleston} + \text{Seattle} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \text{ sheep}

1. We know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes.
2. We also know that when Freda cooks the tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. So, if she uses two cans of tomatoes, she will get 32 ounces of sauce. This is because the volume of one can (16 ounces) is halved (8 ounces) when cooked, and two halves make up 32 ounces.
3. Since each can contains three tomatoes, and she used two cans to make 32 ounces of sauce, the total number of tomatoes used is 3 (from the first can) + 3 (from the second can) = 6 tomatoes.

So, {Freda used 6 tomatoes}.</s>",12,12.0,6.0

                [/INST] First, we need to determine how many elves quit after children vomit on them. A third of the 60 elves quit, so we calculate:

60 elves / 3 = 20 elves

So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them. We then subtract this number from the original number of elves to find out how many are left:

60 elves - 20 elves = 40 elves

Next, we need to determine how many elves quit after 10 of the remaining ones quit due to kids kicking their shins. Out of the remaining 40 elves, 10 quit, so we subtract 10 from the remaining number of elves:

40 elves - 10 elves = 30 elves

                [/INST] First, let's calculate how much time Susan spends on the task. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a 3-hour span. However, she takes a pause of half an hour. So, the actual working time is 3 hours minus half an hour, which equals 2.5 hours.

Next, we need to convert this time into minutes because Susan earns for every 10 minutes. We know that 1 hour equals 60 minutes, so 2.5 hours equals 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.

Now, we can calculate how many 10-minute intervals there are in 150 minutes. This is done by dividing the total minutes by the interval time: 150 / 10 = 15 intervals.

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, the total amount she earns is the number of intervals multiplied by her earnings per interval: 15 * $5 = $75.

                [/INST] First, let's find out how many razors Heather can get from buying two packs without considering the sale. Each pack contains 4 razors, so she would get 4 * 2 = 8 razors.

Next, because the razors are on sale, buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for one razor in each pair. So, the total number of razors she actually pays for is 8 / 2 = 4 razors.

The cost of each pack is $4.00, so the total cost for these 4 razors is 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.

However, Heather also has a $2.00 coupon to use. After applying this coupon, the total cost becomes $16.00 - $2.00 = $14.00.

Finally, to find out the cost of each razor in cents, we divide the total cost by the number of razors and multiply by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar). So, the cost of each razor in cents is ($14.00 / 4 razors) * 100 = $350.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we'll need to first find out how long it takes for the dog to eat the sausages, and then calculate the average time for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages.

1. **Finding the time the dog takes to eat the sausages:**

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. If a dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, then we calculate the time the dog takes as follows:

\[ \text{Time the dog takes} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \, \text{minutes} = 20 \, \text{minutes} \]

2. **Calculating the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages:**

To find the average time, we add the time the cat takes to the time the dog takes and divide by 2 (since there are two animals):

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time the cat takes} + \text{Time the dog takes}}{2} \]

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 \, \text{minutes} + 20 \, \text{minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \, \text{minutes}}{2} = 25 \, \text{minutes} \]

Therefore, the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

                [/INST] First, let's denote the number of notebooks Joseph originally had as j and the number of notebooks Martha originally had as m.

According to the problem, we know that:

j = 3m (Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha)

Then, we are told that Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so her new total is m + 5. And we also know that after buying the additional notebooks, she has 7 notebooks in total. So, we can write the equation:

m + 5 = 7

Now, let's solve this equation for m:

m = 7 - 5
m = 2

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Now, let's find out how many notebooks Joseph has. We use the first equation:

j = 3m
j = 3*2
j = 6

So, Joseph originally had 6 notebooks.

Now, let's find out how many notebooks Martha has now:

She has 7 notebooks after buying 5 more.

Finally, let's find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph:

Martha's notebooks - Joseph's notebooks = 7 - 6 = 1

So, Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money raised by selling lollipops and then subtract the amount spent on buying the lollipops before selling them. Here are the steps:

1. First, calculate the total number of lollipops sold. Each of the 30 students sold 10 lollipops, so the total number of lollipops sold is:
   Total lollipops = Number of students * Lollipops sold per student
   = 30 * 10
   = 300 lollipops

2. Next, calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollipop is sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:
   Total revenue = Total lollipops * Price per lollipop
   = 300 * $0.8
   = $240

3. Then, calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollipop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:
   Total cost = Total lollipops * Cost per lollipop
   = 300 * $0.5
   = $150

4. Finally, calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
   Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   = $240 - $150
   = $90

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

Movies watched during one weekend = Movies watched on Saturday + Movies watched on Sunday = 4 + 2 = 6

Since Jill and her friends watch movies every weekend, we can now calculate the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks:

1. Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies.
2. He sold 150 candies, but because there were only 100 initially ordered, it means he must have had 50 more from somewhere else.
3. After selling 150, he ordered 100 more.

At this point, Dale has:
- The 100 he initially ordered
- The 50 additional candies from somewhere else
- The 100 he ordered after selling the first batch

So, in total, Dale now has:
100 (initial order) + 50 (additional candies) + 100 (additional order) = 250 candies

The question asks how many more candies Dale needs to sell to sell all of his candy. Since he has 250 candies and has already sold 150, he needs to sell:

3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
4. We need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, we know that the time between the two sightings of the comet is 75 years.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. If the time between the two sightings is 75 years, then when Bill saw the comet for the second time, he was 30 (Bill's dad's age when he saw the comet) times 3, which is 90 years old.

So, if Bill was 90 when he saw the comet during the second sighting, and there are 75 years between the two sightings, then to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we subtract 75 years from 90:

90 (Bill's age during the second sighting) - 75 (years between sightings) = 15 years old

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Bernie has 4 dogs, and we know that one of them needs to walk 1 mile, one needs to walk 4 miles, and one needs to walk 3 miles. We need to find out how much the last dog needs to walk.

2. We also know that on average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. To find the total distance they need to walk per day, we can multiply the number of dogs by the average distance:

Total distance = 4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles

3. Now, we can subtract the distances we already know for three of the dogs from the total distance to find the distance the last dog needs to walk:

Distance for last dog = Total distance - (First dog + Second dog + Third dog)
= 12 miles - (1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles)
= 12 miles - 8 miles
= 4 miles

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

The final answer is {The last dog needs to walk 4 miles}.</s>",4,4.0,4.0

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Paul initially has 52 marbles.
2. His friend gives him 28 marbles, so now Paul has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.
3. Paul then loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles that is, we calculate 1/4 of 80, which is 80 * 1/4 = 20 marbles.
4. Subtracting the lost marbles from the total, Paul now has 80 - 20 = 60 marbles.

So, the final answer is Paul has 60 marbles left.</s>",60,60.0,60.0

How many , pairs of ; microphones was he able ; to arrange on the stage?
                [/INST] First, we need to determine how many microphones will not fit on the stage due to not being able to make a pair. This is 20% of the total 50 microphones.

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

Since 10 microphones cannot form a pair, they must be odd in number. To find the total number of pairs, we need to subtract the number of odd microphones from the total number of microphones and then divide by 2 (since a pair consists of 2 microphones).

Step 1: Calculate the number of pairs that can be formed if all microphones could fit:
Total number of pairs = Total number of microphones / Number of microphones in a pair
= 50 / 2
= 25 pairs

Step 2: Adjust for the microphones that do not fit:
Since 10 microphones cannot form a pair, they must be odd in number and therefore they are equivalent to 5 pairs that cannot be formed.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pairs that were successfully arranged:
Pairs arranged = Total number of pairs - Pairs that cannot be formed
= 25 - 5
= 20 pairs

The final answer is: {20 pairs} of microphones were able to be arranged on the stage.</s>",20,20.0,20.0

                [/INST] Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box that Peter has as P and the number of chocolate bars in each box that Martha has as M. We know that Peter has 4 boxes and Martha has 4 boxes as well, but they have different numbers of boxes with chocolate bars.

We are given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars, and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars. So, we can write the following equations:

Peter's chocolate bars: 4P = 64
Martha's chocolate bars: 7M = 56

Now, let's solve these equations:

For Peter:
4P = 64
Divide both sides by 4 to find P:
P = 64 / 4
P = 16

For Martha:
7M = 56
Divide both sides by 7 to find M:
M = 56 / 7
M = 8

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We can do this by subtracting M from P:

More chocolate bars in Peter's box = P - M
More chocolate bars in Peter's box = 16 - 8
More chocolate bars in Peter's box = 8

The final answer is:
Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. {The final answer is: \boxed{8}}</s>",8,8.0,8.0

Anne purchased a box of sweets containing 15 packs, each pack has 60 pieces. She kept 2 packs and gave the rest to 10 friends equally.

Now, let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces Anne initially had. This is done by multiplying the number of packs by the number of pieces per pack: 15 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces.

2. Next, subtract the number of pieces Anne kept for herself (2 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 120 pieces) from the total number of pieces: 900 pieces - 120 pieces = 780 pieces.

3. Finally, divide the remaining pieces of sweets by the number of friends (10 friends) to find out how many pieces each friend received: 780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces/friend.

3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people came in at 10:00, twice this number is 80 more people. So now, we add 80 to the total, which gives us 170 people.
4. Finally, by evening, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, that's 3 times 50, or 150 more people. Adding these to the total gives us 320 people.

1. **Calculate the total cost price of one watermelon**: The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price per watermelon is $80 / 50 = $1.60.

2. **Calculate the total selling price of one watermelon**: The vendor made a 25% profit on each watermelon. Profit is calculated on the cost price. So, the profit on each watermelon is 25% of $1.60, which is $1.60 * 0.25 = $0.40. Therefore, the selling price of each watermelon is the cost price plus the profit, which is $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00.

1. We know that Tim grows 5 trees.
2. He collects 6 lemons from each tree each year.
3. We need to find out how many lemons he collects in a decade (10 years).

To calculate this, we first need to find out how many lemons Tim collects in a year:

Lemons collected in a year = Number of trees * Lemons collected per tree per year
                                     = 5 trees * 6 lemons/tree
                                     = 30 lemons

Now, to find out how many lemons Tim collects in a decade, we multiply the amount of lemons collected in a year by the number of years in a decade:

Lemons collected in a decade = Lemons collected in a year * Years in a decade
                                          = 30 lemons/year * 10 years
                                          = 300 lemons

                [/INST] This problem is about students wanting a certain number of red and green apples. First, let's find out how many total number of apples were ordered.

1. Calculating the total number of apples ordered:
   Total apples = Number of red apples + Number of green apples
   = 43 + 32
   = 75

Now, if there are only two students and they each want a piece of fruit, it means 2 fruits are required by the students. So, subtract this from the total number of apples to find out how many apples the cafeteria ends up with extra.

2. Calculating the extra apples:
   Extra apples = Total apples - Apples needed
   = 75 - 2
   = 73

So, the cafeteria ends up with an extra 73 apples.

                [/INST] The problem is not fully clear and requires some assumptions to solve. Let's start by filling in the blanks:

Haley and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Haley picked 39 carrots and her mom picked 38 carrots. If only 64 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?

Since Haley picked 39 carrots and her mom picked 38 carrots, they picked a total of 39 + 38 = 77 carrots. If 64 of these carrots were good, then the number of bad carrots is the total number of carrots minus the number of good carrots.

However, it seems there might be a mistake in the problem as the total number of picked carrots (77) is more than the number of good carrots (64). This means that either Haley or her mom could have picked more than 64 good carrots. Assuming that both of them picked good carrots, the maximum possible number of good carrots they could have picked together is the number of carrots picked by Haley plus the number of carrots picked by her mom, which is 39 + 38 = 77.

If they both picked only good carrots, then there would be no bad carrots. But since the problem states that only 64 of the carrots were good, we have to assume that one of them picked some bad carrots. Without more information about how many carrots each of them picked, we can't determine the exact number of bad carrots.

However, if we assume that Haley picked all 39 carrots, then her mom must have picked 25 bad carrots out of her 38 carrots, because the total number of bad carrots is 77 - 64 = 13, so in this case, the number of bad carrots is 25.

If instead we assume that her mom picked all 38 carrots, then Haley must have picked 13 bad carrots out of her 39 carrots, which could be possible if we assume that the 64 good carrots is the total number of carrots picked by Haley.

So, depending on which assumption we make, the number of bad carrots could be either 25 or 38. But without more information, we can't determine the exact number of bad carrots.

Vanessa has 13 music files and 30 video files.

Step 2: Identify the number of files Vanessa deleted.
Vanessa deleted 10 files.

Step 3: Identify the remaining number of music files.
Since no information is given about deleting a specific type of file, we will assume that the deletion was random and applied to both types of files.

1. **Initial Spring Earnings**: Kaleb made $4 in the spring mowing lawns.

2. **Summer Earnings**: Kaleb made $50 in the summer mowing lawns.

3. **Total Earnings Before Supplies**: To find out how much money Kaleb had before buying supplies, we add his spring and summer earnings:
   \[
   \$4 + \$50 = \$54
   \]

4. **Expenses on Supplies**: Kaleb had to spend $4 on supplies.

5. **Final Amount After Supplies**: To find out how much money Kaleb ended up with after buying supplies, we subtract the cost of supplies from his total earnings:
   \[
   \$54 - \$4 = \$50
   \]

Therefore, Kaleb ended up with $\boxed{\$50}$.</s>",50,50.0,50.0

                [/INST] To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to first find out how many apples were ordered in total and then subtract the number of apples that were taken by the students.

The cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples. So, the total number of apples ordered is:

Apples ordered = Red apples + Green apples
= 6 + 15
= 21 apples

Then, we find out how many apples the students took. It is given that only 5 students wanted fruit. However, it is not specified how many apples each student took. So, let's assume each student took one apple. This would mean:

Apples taken = Number of students * Apples per student
= 5 * 1
= 5 apples

Now, we can calculate the number of extra apples:

Extra apples = Apples ordered - Apples taken
= 21 - 5
= 16 apples

So, the cafeteria ended up with 16 extra apples.

Final answer: The cafeteria ended up with 16 extra apples. {The final answer is: 16}</s>",16,16.0,16.0

Haley originally had 27 music files and 42 video files on her flash drive. The total number of files is the sum of these two numbers.

Step 2: Calculate the original total number of files
Total number of files = Number of music files + Number of video files
Total number of files = 27 + 42 = 69 files

Step 3: Calculate the number of files after deletion
Haley deleted 11 files. So, the number of files left on her flash drive is the original total minus the deleted files.

Step 4: Calculate the final number of files
Final number of files = Original total number of files - Deleted files
Final number of files = 69 - 11 = 58 files

To find out how many extra apples they had, we need to first find out the total number of apples they prepared and then subtract the number of apples that were wanted by the 10 students.

Step 1: Find the total number of apples prepared by the cafeteria.
Total apples = Red apples + Green apples
Total apples = 25 + 17
Total apples = 42

Step 2: Find out how many apples were wanted by the 10 students.
Since it was only mentioned that 10 students wanted fruit, we cannot determine the exact number of apples they wanted. However, we can assume that each student took one apple.

Apples wanted by students = Number of students
Apples wanted by students = 10

Step 3: Find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with.
Extra apples = Total apples prepared - Apples wanted by students
Extra apples = 42 - 10
Extra apples = 32

However, the question did not specify how the students took the apples. It could be one student took one apple, or there could be a combination of one apple and two apples.

2. She then graded 4 worksheets, which means the number of worksheets to grade is reduced. So, we subtract 4 from the initial number: 38 - 4 = 34.
3. However, then another 15 worksheets were turned in, which means the number of worksheets to grade increases. So, we add 15 to the current number: 34 + 15 = 49.

2. Only 38% of the carrots were good. So, the number of good carrots is 0.38 * 45 = 17.1. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a carrot, let's round this number to the nearest whole number. In this case, we'll round down to 17 because you usually can't have a part of a fully grown carrot and it's more likely that the fraction represents an error in the data rather than a partial carrot.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. The florist starts with 37 roses.
2. She sells 16 of them, so she has 37 - 16 = 21 roses left.
3. Then she picks 19 more, so she has 21 + 19 = 40 roses.

So, the florist would have 40 roses. {The final answer is 40.}</s>",40,40.0,40.0

                [/INST] Sure, let's break it down:

1. The florist starts with 6 roses.
2. She sells 5/7 of her roses. To find out how many that is, we calculate 5/7 * 6 = 30/7 ≈ 4.29, but since we can't have a fraction of a rose in this context, we'll round down to 4 roses sold (since she can't sell a fraction of a rose).
3. After selling 4 roses, she has 6 - 4 = 2 roses left.
4. She then picks 12 more roses.
5. The final count of roses is 2 (remaining after selling) + 12 (newly picked) = 14 roses.

So, the final answer is: The florist would have 14 roses.</s>",13,13.0,14.0
