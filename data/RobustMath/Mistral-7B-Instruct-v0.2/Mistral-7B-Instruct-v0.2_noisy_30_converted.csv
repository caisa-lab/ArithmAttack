                    question:
                    A ? robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber ! and half that much ? white ! fiber.  ; How , many bolts in total does it take?
                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many bolts of blue fiber are needed. We know that one robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.

{One robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber}.

Next, let's find out how many bolts of white fiber are needed, which is half the amount of blue fiber.

{One robe requires half of the bolts of blue fiber. Since one robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber, then one robe requires 2 bolts * 0.5 = 1 bolt of white fiber}.

To find the total number of bolts required, we need to find the sum of bolts of both colors.

{The final answer is: One robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts in total}.</s>",3,3.0,3.0

                 [/INST] To find the number of hours John spends taking care of dogs per week, we first need to calculate the number of hours he spends on walking and taking care of business for each dog daily, and then find the total hours for all dogs in a week.

1. Hours spent on walking each dog per day: 10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours.
2. Hours spent on taking care of business for each dog per day: 10 dogs * ! ! = It is not clear how many hours to take for taking care of business for each dog. So, we'll leave it as is and continue with what we have: 5 hours on walking.

3. Total hours spent on taking care of dogs daily: 5 hours on walking (step 1) + ? hours on taking care of business (step 2) = 5 hours + ?.

Unfortunately, we cannot provide a definitive answer for the number of hours spent on taking care of business per day for each dog without that critical piece of information. Therefore, the final answer is:

                 [/INST] To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained from the 4-foot-long wire after cutting it into 6-inch-long pieces, we first need to determine how many 6-inch-long pieces can be made from 1 foot (12 inches) of wire, then calculate the number of such pieces that can be made from the 4-foot-long wire.

1. First, let's find out how many 6-inch pieces can be made from 1 foot:
   1 foot = 12 inches
   Number of 6-inch pieces in 1 foot = 1 foot / 6 inches/piece
   = 2 pieces/foot
2. Since 1 foot equals 4 pieces of 6-inch pieces, we can find out how many 6-inch pieces are in 4 feet:
    4 feet = 4 * 12 inches
           = 48 inches
   Number of 6-inch pieces in 4 feet = 4 feet / 6 inches/piece
   = 8 pieces/foot
   = 8 * 4 pieces
   = 32 pieces

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many hours James slept.
Since James slept for 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can calculate how many hours that is as follows:

Harry slept for 9 hours
James slept for 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours

Step 2: Determine the difference in hours between Harry and James' sleep.

Difference in hours = Harry's hours - James' hours
Difference in hours = 9 - 6 = 3 hours

1. Each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times per day.
2. In each lesson, the teacher cleans the whiteboard 3 times.

So, the number of whiteboard cleanings per teacher per day is:
2 lessons/day * 3 cleanings/lesson = 6 cleanings/day

There are 4 teachers in the classroom, so the total number of whiteboard cleanings in a day is:
6 cleanings/teacher/day * 4 teachers = 24 cleanings/day

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Ryan plants 2 flowers a day in his garden.

Step 2: After 15 days, the number of flowers planted would be 2 (flowers planted per day) x 15 (number of days).

Step 3: However, we're told that 5 flowers didn't grow. So, the actual number of flowers in Ryan's garden would be the number of plants minus the number that didn't grow.

Step 4: Subtract the 5 flowers that didn't grow from the total number of flowers we calculated in step 2: 2 x 15 = 30. So, 30 - 5 = 25.

The final answer is: Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden.</s>",25,25.0,25.0

                    question:
                    After transferring to a new school, Amy made . 20 more friends ! than Lily. ; If . Lily ? made 50 friends, ; how many : friends do Lily and Amy have ! together?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, so the number of friends Amy has is one more than the number of friends Lily has.

Let's denote the number of friends Lily has as L. Then, the number of friends Amy has is L + 20.

Step 2: Lily made 50 friends. So, Lily has L = 50 - friend_difference friends less than Amy.

Step 3: Substitute L = 50 - friend_difference in the expression for the number of friends Amy has to find the combined number of friends they have.

friends_Amy = L + 20
          = (50 - friend_difference) + 20
          = 50 + 20 - friend_difference
          = 70 - friend_difference

To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, add their individual friend counts:

Total_friends = friends_Amy + friends_Lily
             = 70 - friend_difference + 50 - friend_difference
             = 120 - 2 * friend_difference

However, since the question asks for a clear answer, we need to account for the fact that friend_difference is the difference in the number of friends between them, not an absolute number. Therefore, we should find the absolute value of friend_difference and add it to Amy's friend count since Amy has more friends than Lily.

Total_friends = 70 + 20 + abs(friend_difference)
             = 90 + abs(friend_difference)

                 [/INST] Step 1: On Monday, the depth of the water in the tank is 17 feet.

Step 2: On Tuesday, there is 7 feet more water in the tank than on Monday. So, the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 feet + 7 feet = <<17+7=24>>24 feet.

Step 3: On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, the depth of the water on Wednesday is (2/3)*24 = <<2/3*24=15.333333333333336>>15.33 feet (approximately).

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the amount of money Ethel has. In mathematical terms, this can be represented as: Jimmy's money = 2 * Ethel's money + $2

Step 2: We also know that Ethel has $8. So we can substitute ""Ethel's money"" with 8 in the equation: Jimmy's money = 2 * $8 + $2

1. Andy plants 90 geraniums.
2. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums.
3. To find out how many petunias Andy plants, we need to find the difference between the number of geraniums and the number of petunias.
4. Petunias = Geraniums - 40
5. Subtracting 40 from the number of geraniums: Geraniums - 40 = Petunias
6. Therefore, Andy plants 90 geraniums and (90-40) petunias.

The final answer is: Andy plants 130 flowers in total (90 geraniums + 40 petunias).</s>",140,140.0,40.0

                 [/INST] Step 1: The company spends $15000 on advertising in the first year.

Step 2: In the second year, the company spends a third of the amount spent in the first year on advertising. To find out how much that is, we need to find one third of $15000.

Step 3: To find one third of $15000, we can divide $15000 by 3.

$15000 ÷ 3 = $5000

Step 4: So, the company spends $5000 on advertising in the second year.

Step 5: To find the total amount spent on advertising in the two years, we add the amounts spent in each year.

Total amount spent = $15000 (first year) + $5000 (second year)

Step 2: Determine how many slices come with one pizza.
One pizza is sold sliced into 8 portions, so each pizza provides:

Step 2: By the end of the fourth week, Josh has added 3 balls to his initial 3, making it a total of 6 balls he's practicing with.

Step 3: At the talent show, Josh slips and drops all 3 balls he's juggling on stage.

Step 4: Two of the dropped balls are caught by the crowd.

Step 5: Unfortunately, one ball gets lost in the dark auditorium.

Step 6: With a sigh, Josh starts juggling on stage again, trying to regain his composure. There are no balls mentioned in his hands at this point, so we don't know how many he's juggling. If we assume he starts juggling again with the amount he practiced with (6 balls), it would make the situation more complicated and less entertaining for the audience who's already seen him drop all of them once. For the sake of the talent show, it's likely Josh will continue juggling with fewer balls to avoid any further mishaps and to give the audience a chance to enjoy his performance.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Ray had 25 lollipops.

Step 2: Ray kept 5 lollipops for himself. So, the number of lollipops Ray gave away is:
25 (total lollipops) - 5 (lollipops Ray kept) = 20 lollipops

Step 3: Ray gave the remaining 20 lollipops equally to his 4 friends. So, the number of lollipops each friend received is:
20 (lollipops given away) / 4 (number of friends)

Step 4: The calculation in Step 3 can be simplified as follows:
20 / 4 = 5
However, this result indicates that each friend received 5 lollipops, which is not possible since there were only 20 lollipops in total for Ray to share.

Step 5: There must have been an error in the question as the number of lollipops Ray had initially or the number of friends he had were given incorrectly. Without the correct information, it's impossible to determine how many lollipops each friend received.

1. First, we need to find out the rate at which the plane travels. Since it travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, its rate of speed is:

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles/hour

2. Now, we want to find out how long it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate of 400 miles/hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

12 croissants make 1 dozen.
Butter needed for 12 croissants = 1/4 pound

Step 2: Find out how much butter is needed to make 4 dozen croissants.
Butter needed for 1 dozen = 1/4 pound
Butter needed for 4 dozen = 1/4 pound * 4 = 1.5 pounds

The final answer is: Juan will need 1.5 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants daily.

Step 3: Find out how much butter is needed for a week (7 days).
Butter needed for 1 day = 1.5 pounds

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate how much meat Prince sells in one day.
Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour, and he works for 10 hours a day. So he sells:
Meat sold in 1 day = Meat sold per hour * Hours worked per day
= 15kg * 10hrs
= 150kg

Step 2: Calculate how long it takes Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull.
The bull weighs 750kg. Since Prince sells 150kg per day, it will take him:
Days to sell the meat = Total weight of meat * (1 day / Weight of meat Prince sells per day)
= 750kg * (1day / 150kg)
= 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright on a 30-foot wave and there are 100 riders in total.

To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we first need to find the number of riders who can't by subtracting the number of riders who can from the total number of riders.

Number of riders who can't stay upright = Total number of riders × (1 − Percentage who can stay upright)
Number of riders who can't stay upright = 100 × (1 − 0.25)
Number of riders who can't stay upright = 100 × 0.75
Number of riders who can't stay upright = 75

Number of riders who can stay upright = Total number of riders − Number of riders who can't stay upright
Number of riders who can stay upright = 100 − 75
Number of riders who can stay upright = 25

Step 2: Find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave.
Given that 60% of the riders are women.

Let's first find the number of women who can stay upright on the wave:

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 × 0.4
Number of women who can stay upright = 10

Now, let's find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave:

Number of men who can stay upright = Total number of riders who can stay upright − Number of women who can stay upright
Number of men who can stay upright = 25 − 10
Number of men who can stay upright = 15.

2. We know that Sheila has already written 1/3 of the paper, so to find out how many pages she has already written, we multiply the total number of pages in the paper by 1/3: 45 pages * 1/3 = 15 pages.
3. Therefore, Sheila has already written 15 pages out of the 45 pages required for her research paper.
4. To find out how many pages are left to write, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages required: 45 pages - 15 pages = 30 pages.

                 [/INST] To find out how many hours the firefighters need to fundraise in total to reach their goal, we first need to determine how many hours it takes them to raise $2100 and then subtract that from the total number of hours needed to raise $6300.

Let x be the number of hours it takes to raise $2100. Since they raise an equal amount per hour, it takes one hour to raise $2100. Therefore, x = 2100.

To find out how many hours it takes them in total to reach their goal of $6300, we divide the goal amount by the amount raised per hour:

Total hours = Goal / Amount raised per hour

Total hours = 6300 / 21

Total hours = 295.24 (approximately)

Since they can't fundraise for a fraction of an hour, they need to work for at least 300 hours to reach their goal. This means that, after raising $2100 in the first 3 hours, they need to fundraise for an additional 297 hours to reach their goal.

Step 2: We also know that 10 students like to bake, 5 students like to play basketball, and the rest either like to play video games or play music.

Step 3: The number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. So, let's find the number of students who like to play basketball first.

Step 4: We know that there are 5 students who like to play basketball, so the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10 students.

Step 5: Since there are 50 students in total, and we have identified 10 students who like to play music and 5 students who like to play basketball, we can find out how many students like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like baking from the total number of students.

Step 6: We know that 10 students like to bake and 5 students like to play basketball, so the number of students who like to play video games is 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 students.

                    Melissa . works as a , pet groomer. This week, ? she : has 8 dogs that need to be bathed, 5 cats ! that need their : nails clipped, 3 ; birds . that ? need their wings trimmed, and 12 horses that ? need to . be ? brushed. If : she splits the grooming ! jobs evenly over ? the days, how many , animals ! will she groom each ! day of the week?
                 [/INST] To find out how many animals Melissa grooms each day of the week, we first need to find out how many animals need to be groomed in total and then divide that number by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find out how many animals need grooming:

* Dogs: 8
* Cats: 5
* Birds: 3
* Horses: 12

Total number of animals = 8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 26 animals

Next, let's find out how many animals she can groom each day if she wants to distribute the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week:

Animals groomed per day = Total number of animals / Number of days in a week
 = 26 animals / 7 days
 = 🌍≈3.71 animals per day

Since she cannot groom a fraction of an animal, we need to round this number up or down to a realistic number. Rounding either way would result in giving too many or too few animals a day. To find a more reasonable number, let's try to distribute the jobs as evenly as possible:

Looking at the given numbers, Melissa has a relatively large number of horses, which accounts for a majority of her grooming jobs. If she were to groom only horses one day of the week, she could groom 12 animals or 🐎3.4 horses per day. Since the number of horses is not divisible by the number of days in a week, this approach is not feasible. Instead, we can assume that she spends a day on horses exclusive of her other days.

Therefore, to split the grooming jobs evenly among the rest of the days, we distribute the jobs for dogs, cats, and birds. With 8 dogs, 5 cats, and 3 birds coming to 16 animals, that leaves Melissa grooming approximately 2.21 animals per day excluding the day on horses. Although this is smaller than her capacity for that ratio, we assume it to be a reasonable number to consider since we're already assigning more than one full day to the horses. For this reason, we recommend Melissa consider grooming 3 animals per day, with one day solely dedicated to grooming horses.

Now that we have established a feasible day-to-day grooming plan, let's find out how many animals Melissa will encounter on each day of the week excluding the horse-grooming day:

Total number of animals groomed per week = 26 animals
Number of animals groomed per day (excluding horses) = 3 animals

So, Melissa will groom roughly 3 animals per day, excluding the horses:

{The final answer is: Melissa grooms approximately 3 animals each day of the week (excluding the day dedicated to horses).}</s>",4,4.0,3.0

1. We know Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
2. He played 1 match on Friday.
3. On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday.

Let's find out how many matches he played on Saturday:
- He played 2 matches on Monday.
- Saturday has double the number of matches he played on Monday.
- Therefore, Joey played 2 * 2 = << 2*2=4 >>4 matches on Saturday.

Now we know that Joey played 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday, and 4 matches on Saturday in one week.
- So the total number of matches Joey played in one week = 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = << 2+1+4=7 >>7 matches.

How , many . pounds of carrots did Daisy buy?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the weight of a bag of potatoes as P. Since the weight of a bag of potatoes is 5 pounds, we have:

1. P = 5 pounds

The weight of a bag of sweet potatoes is 2 times the weight of a bag of potatoes:

2. Weight of a bag of sweet potatoes = 2 * P

Now we know that the weight of a bag of carrots is 3 pounds fewer than the weight of a bag of sweet potatoes. So,

3. Weight of a bag of carrots = Weight of a bag of sweet potatoes - 3 pounds
4. Weight of a bag of carrots = 2 * P - 3

Now, let's find the weight of the carrots that Daisy bought in total. Since she bought one bag of potatoes, one bag of sweet potatoes, and one bag of carrots, the total weight is:

5. Total weight = P + 2 * (2 * P) - 3
6. Total weight = P + 4 * P - 3
7. Total weight = 5 * P - 3

Now, since our initial assumption was that the weight of a bag of potatoes was P, we can find the weight of the total purchase by substituting that value back in:

8. Total weight = 5 * (5 pounds) - 3
9. Total weight = 25 pounds - 3 = 22 pounds

Finally, we'll find the weight of the carrots:

10. Weight of carrots = 5 * P - 3 - P
11. Weight of carrots = 4 * P - 3
12. Weight of a bag of carrots = 4 * (5 pounds) - 3
13. Weight of a bag of carrots = 20 pounds - 3 = 17 pounds

Therefore, Daisy bought 17 pounds of carrots.

- The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays.
- They make 125 chimichangas on Wednesdays.
- They make twice as many chimichangas on Fridays as they do on the other two days.

Step 2: Find the number of chimichangas made on Fridays.
Since they make twice as many chimichangas on Fridays as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, we can calculate the number of chimichangas made on Fridays as follows:
Chimichangas on Fridays = 2 * Chimichangas on Tuesdays and Wednesdays = 2 * 125 = 250

Step 3: Sum up the number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
Total chimichangas made = Chimichangas on Tuesdays + Chimichangas on Wednesdays + Chimichangas on Fridays

- Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.
- Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that.

Step 2: Substitute the given information into the equation.
- Let's define 'x' as the number of acres in Farmer Brown's farm.
- Then, Farmer Smith's farm has x + 100 acres.

Step 3: Solve for the total number of acres for both farms.
- We know that Farmer Brown's farm has x acres.
- According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm has 100 acres more than twice that, which would be 2x + 100.
- To find the total number of acres for both farms, add the number of acres for each farm: x (Farmer Brown's farm) + (2x + 100) (Farmer Smith's farm).

Step 4: Combine like terms.
- In this case, there are no like terms to combine.

Step 5: Find the final answer.
- The equation showing the total number of acres for both farms is x + 2x + 100.
- Combining like terms results in 3x + 100.
- Since we do not have a specific value for 'x', we cannot represent the answer in terms of 'x' alone; instead, we can express the answer as an equation: 3x + 100 = total number of acres for both farms.
- Therefore, if we were given a specific value for 'x', we could determine the combined number of acres for both farms.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each one step by step:

1. We know that James spends 10 minutes reading 3 pages of his book before bed.
2. He reads 18 pages in total before going to sleep.
3. To find out how long it takes James to read 18 pages, we first need to find out how long it takes him to read one page.

To find out how long it takes James to read one page, we can divide the time it takes him to read 3 pages by the number of pages:

Time per page = Time to read 3 pages / Number of pages
Time per page = 10 minutes / 3 pages = 3 minutes and 40 seconds (approximately, since we usually express minutes as whole numbers)

Now that we know James spends about 3 minutes and 40 seconds to read one page, we can multiply this by the number of pages he reads in total to find out how long it takes him to read all 18 pages:

Total time = Time per page * Number of pages
Total time = 3 minutes and 40 seconds per page * 18 pages
Total time = 64 minutes and 40 seconds

Since the time was given in minutes, we don't need to convert minutes and seconds to hours for the final answer. Therefore, the final answer is:

                 [/INST] Let's think step by step through this problem:

1. We know that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.
2. We also know that Sofie walks 10 miles every day.

Let's first find out how far Sofie walks in 7 days:
Sofie's daily distance = 10 miles
Distance she covers in 7 days = Daily distance * Number of days
Distance Sofie covers in 7 days = 10 miles * 7 days
Distance Sofie covers in 7 days = 70 miles

Now we know that Brian covers half that distance in the same number of days:
Brian's daily distance = Sofie's daily distance / 2
Brian's daily distance = 10 miles / 2
Brian's daily distance = 5 miles

To find Brian's total distance covered in 7 days, we multiply his daily distance by the number of days:
Brian's total distance = Daily distance * Number of days
Brian's total distance = 5 miles * 7 days
Brian's total distance = 35 miles

number of balloons = packs filled * balloons per pack
number of balloons = 10 * 30
number of balloons = 300

Step 2: However, we also know that by the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. The total number of balloons they used, including the ones that were not thrown and the ones that were thrown and burst, must have exceeded the number of filled balloons:

total number of balloons > number of filled balloons
300 < total number of balloons

Step 3: To find the number of balloons they actually threw, we can subtract the number of leftover balloons from the initial amount:

To find the number of pomelos given away, we can first find the number of pomelos Eve has left:

1/4 * 20 = 5 pomelos left

Now we can find the number of pomelos given away by subtracting the number of pomelos Eve has left from the original amount:

20 (Eve's original pomelos) = 20 > 5 (pomelos left) + X (pomelos given away)

                 [/INST] To find out how many times the alarm rang in total, we need to calculate the number of rings during each alarm event and then sum them up.

1. The first alarm event: It rang four times.
2. The second alarm event: It rang three times, which was longer than the first time it rang. Let's assume the first ringing lasted for A units of time. Since the second ringing was longer, we can write the equation: 3 * B = A + 4 (where B is the duration of the second alarm event in units greater than A).
3. The third alarm event: It rang for half the duration of the second alarm event. So, the third alarm rang for B/2 units of time.

Now, we have two equations:
 - 4 = A (First alarm rings)
 - 3 * B = A + 4 (Second alarm rings)

We want to find the total number of rings, which is the sum of rings during all alarm events. Let's first solve the algebraic equation for A:

4 = A
A = 4

Now we have A = 4, and for the second equation:

3 * B = 4 + 4
3 * B = 8
B = 8 / 3

B is not a whole number, which means our assumption about the second alarm being longer than the first one was incorrect. Let's try another approach.

First, let's find the duration of the second alarm event accurately. Since the first alarm event rings for 4 rings and the third alarm event rings for half the duration of the second alarm, we can write:

1st alarm: 4 rings
2nd alarm: x rings
3rd alarm: x/2 rings

We know that the duration of 1 ring during the second and third alarms is equal. Let's call it y units. So, we have:

4 * y = Duration of the first alarm event
x * y = Duration of the second alarm event
(x/2) * y = Duration of the third alarm event

Since the duration of the third alarm event is half the duration of the second alarm event, we have:

x * y = (x/2) * y * 2

Divide both sides by y:

x = 2 * x/2
x = x
x = 2 * (Duration of the third alarm event / y)

Substitute x/2 from the third alarm equation into this equation:

x = 2 * (x / (2 * y))

Cross multiplication:

x = 2 * (1 / (1 / 2 * y))
x = 2 * 2 * y
x = 4 * y

Now, we have x = 4 * y. We already know that A = 4, and we can now find y:

Duration of the first alarm event = 4 * y
Duration of the second alarm event = x * y = 4 * y * (4 * y) = 16 * y^2
Duration of the third alarm event = x / 2 = 4 * y / 2 = 2 * y

We know that the third alarm event rings for half the duration of the second alarm event:

2 * y = Duration of the third alarm event
2 * y = 16 * y^2 / 16
y = y^2
y = 1
y = 1

Since y is equal to 1, we have the following numbers of rings for each alarm event:
 - 4 rings for the first alarm event
 - x rings for the second alarm event
   x = 4 * y = 4 * 1 = 4
   x = 4 rings
 - x/2 rings for the third alarm event
   x = 4 * y = 4 * 1 = 4
   x/2 = 2 rings

Now, we can calculate the total number of rings:

Total number of rings = 4 (First alarm) + 4 (Second alarm) + 2 (Third alarm) = 10 rings.

                 [/INST] Let's reason through this problem step by step:

1. We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, and Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
2. We also know that Corey is 1 year older than James, who is 10 years old.

Now let's find the age of Jackson using this information:

3. From the first piece of information, we know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, Jackson is 5 years younger than Amy.
4. We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore, Corey is 2 years older than Amy.
5. Since Corey is 1 year older than James, Corey is 11 years old (James is 10).
6. We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. To find Jackson's age, we can set up the following equations:
   - Amy's age = Jackson's age +5
   - Amy's age = Corey's age -2
   - Corey's age = Amy's age -1  (Corey is 1 year older than Amy)

7. Now we have the following system of equations:
   - Jackson's age +5 = Amy's age
   - Amy's age = Corey's age -2
   - Corey's age = Amy's age -1

8. Substituting Corey's age (11) and Amy's age (Corey is 2 years older than Amy) into the first equation, we get Jackson's age +5 = 13.
9. Solving this equation, we get Jackson's age = 8.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, then the first two containers have a total of: 2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles.

Step 2: Determine the number of vehicles after the first day.
The total number of vehicles at the port after the first day is 10 vehicles (from the first two containers) + 20 vehicles (unspecified number of vehicles from the second day) = 30 vehicles.

Step 3: Calculate the number of vehicles in the second day's containers.
To find the number of containers brought in on the second day, we can set up an equation: 10 vehicles (from first 2 containers) + X vehicles (from second day's containers) = 30 vehicles.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars

                 [/INST] April has bought 100 plant pots from the garden center before she knew how many she needed for the school. The school asked for 30 pots for daisies and twice as many for roses.

First, let's find out how many pots are needed for roses: 30 pots for daisies, so we know that's the number for one type of flower. Therefore, for twice as many roses, we need 2 * 30 = <<2*30=60>>60 plant pots.

Next, let's determine how many plant pots April has in total: 100 (already bought) + 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = <<100+30+60=190>>190 plant pots.

Finally, since the question asks for the number of plant pots left over, we can simply find the difference between the total number of plant pots and the number of plant pots the school asked for: 190 (total) - 30 (for daisies) - 60 (for roses) = <<190-30-60=100>>100 plant pots.

Dora has saved $2 from her allowance, and her mother gave her $16. So, Dora has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy.
The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, the total cost of the items is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total cost of the items and the total amount of money Dora has.
To find out how much more money Dora needs, subtract the total amount of money she has from the total cost of the items. $19 (total cost) - $18 (total amount of money) = $1.

Paul makes one ride in the morning and one ride in the afternoon, making a total of 2 rides per day. He drives for 14 days.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of rides Paul makes during the two-week period.
Total number of rides = Number of rides per day * Number of days = 2 * 14 = 28 rides

Step 4: Calculate the number of rows for each color.
- For red tulips: Number of rows = 36 / 6 = 6 rows
- For blue tulips: Number of rows = 24 / 8 = 3 rows

Step 5: Since Jackson is planting both red and blue tulips, we need to determine the total number of rows.

Let S be the age of Shiloh and N be the age of his nephew.

We know that:
Shiloh's age today is S = 44 years old
In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so:
S + 7 = 3N
Now we need to solve the equation for N.

First, we can express N in terms of S:
N = S / 3

Now let's find the value of S in terms of N. We already have an expression for S in the original equation:
S + 7 = 3N

To find the value of S, we can substitute the expression of N in terms of S into the equation and solve for S:
S + 7 = 3(S / 3)
S + 7 = S * 3 / 3
S + 7 = S * 1
S + 7 = S
S = -7

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps (S = 16)
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps (T = S + 3)
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps (R = T - 9)

We need to find the total number of stamps Max bought, which is S + T + R.

Substituting the given values, we get:

S = 16
T = S + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19
R = T - 9

Now, we have T = 19 and R = T - 9 = 19 - 9 = 10. However, we don't yet know the exact relationship between S, T, and R. To find the total number of stamps, we need to use the given information that the number of snowflake stamps (S) is less than the number of truck stamps (T):

16 (snowflake stamps) < 19 (truck stamps)

Since S = 16 and T = 19, this means there is a difference of 3 between the number of snowflake and truck stamps. However, we also know that there are fewer rose stamps (R) than truck stamps, so:

10 (rose stamps) < 19 (truck stamps)

This means that the difference between R and T is 9. From the given information, we know that there is a difference of 3 between S and T, and a difference of 9 between T and R. We can write this as:

1. S < T
2. T - S = 3
3. R - T = -9

Now, let's solve for R in terms of S and T:

R = T - 9
R = (S + 3) - 9
R = S + 3 - 9
R = S - 6

So, the number of rose stamps is 6 fewer than the number of snowflake stamps. Now we can find the total number of stamps Max bought:

S = 16
T = S + 3 = 19
R = S - 6

Total number of stamps = S + T+ R = 16 + 19 + (16 - 6) = 31

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is Max bought 31 stamps in total.}</s>",45,45.0,31.0

                 [/INST] To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents, we first need to calculate the number of sales for each type of scent.

For vanilla scents:
Number of sales = Number of units sold for each vanilla scent * Number of different vanilla scents
Number of sales = 5 units * 4 different scents
Number of sales = 20 units in total

For fruity scents:
Number of sales = Number of units sold for each fruity scent * Number of different fruity scents
Number of sales = 2 units * 8 different scents
Number of sales = 16 units in total

Now we subtract the number of fruity scent sales from the number of vanilla scent sales to find the difference:

Difference in sales = Vanilla sales - Fruity sales
Difference in sales = 20 units - 16 units
Difference in sales = 4 units

Therefore,
The final answer is: {4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents}.</s>",4,4.0,4.0

                    ; Bennet is a farmer. He sells ; 20 of his : eggplants for $3 each. He has : 25 ears of corn ; that he can . sell as : well. If : Bennet wants to make : a total , of ; $135, how much : should he sell each ear of ; corn for?
                 [/INST] First, let's find out how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants:
Eggplants sold = 20
Price per eggplant = $3
Total earnings from eggplants = Eggplants sold * Price per eggplant
Total earnings from eggplants = 20 * $3
Total earnings from eggplants = $60

Now, we know that Bennet wants to earn a total of $135, so we need to find out how much money he can earn from selling the ears of corn. Let's denote the price per ear of corn as x.

Total earnings = Earnings from eggplants + Earnings from corn
$135 = $60 + x * 25
$135 = $60 + 25x

To find the value of x, we need to solve this equation:

First, subtract $60 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term containing x:

$75 = 25x

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 25 to find the value of x:

x = $75 / 25
x = $3

However, it seems there's a mistake in the problem statement, as both the eggplant earnings and the target earnings are less than $135. Let's assume that the target earnings should be $135 + $60 = $195 instead.

Now, let's solve for the new value of x:

Total earnings = Earnings from eggplants + Earnings from corn
$195 = $60 + x * 25
$195 = $60 + 25x

Following the same steps as before:

Subtract $60 from both sides:
$135 = 25x

Divide both sides by 25:
x = $135 / 25
x = $5.4

Since Bennet can sell the ears of corn for approximately $5.4 each to reach a total earnings of $195.

{The final answer is: Approximately $5.4 per ear of corn.}</s>",3,3.0,5.4

                 [/INST] To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we need to determine how cold it is inside the house during the night and calculate how many logs it takes to raise the temperature above freezing (32 degrees).

Given:
- It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day.
- The house is at 45 degrees during the day.

To find the temperature inside the house during the night:

Temperature during the night = Temperature during the day - 33 degrees

Calculate the temperature during the night:

Temperature during the night = 45 degrees - 33 degrees

Temperature during the night = 12 degrees

Since the temperature inside the house needs to be above freezing to prevent the pipes from freezing, we need to find out how many logs it takes to raise the temperature by 9 degrees (from 12 degrees to 21 degrees which is above freezing):

Given:
- Each log raises the temperature inside the house by 5 degrees.

To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn:

Number of logs = Desired temperature increase / Temperature increase per log

Calculate the number of logs:

Number of logs = 9 degrees / 5 degrees/log

Number of logs = 1.8 logs

Since Carson cannot burn a fraction of a log, he will need to burn:

{The final answer is: 2 logs}

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 2 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.</s>",4,4.0,2.0

The original price of the jeans was $40 and they were advertised as being 25% off. So, to find the discounted price, we need to find 25% of $40.

Calculation: $40 * 0.25 = $10

Let's subtract the $10 discount from the original price to find the discounted price.

Subtraction: $40 - $10 = $30

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Mike will pay for the jeans.
Mike will pay the discounted price of the jeans, which is $30.

Step 3: Determine how much money Mike has left after paying for the jeans.

                 [/INST] To find out how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to find the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between their final positions.

First, let's find the distance each car travels in 1 hour. We know that:

The first car travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
The second car travels at a speed of 70 miles per hour.

Since both cars travel for 1 hour after the second car passes the first one, the distance between them after 1 hour is the difference in their travel distances during that hour:

Distance between cars after 1 hour = Distance traveled by first car - Distance traveled by second car

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled by each car in 1 hour:

Distance traveled by first car in 1 hour = Speed of first car * Hours
 = 60 miles/hour * 1 hour
 = 60 miles

Distance traveled by second car in 1 hour = Speed of second car * Hours
 = 70 miles/hour * 1 hour
 = 70 miles

So, the difference in their distances after 1 hour is:

Difference in distances after 1 hour = 60 miles (first car) - 70 miles (second car)
 = -10 miles

However, it isn't possible for the second car to travel more miles than the first car during this time. This means that there's a mistake in the problem statement or the given data. In this case, the problem doesn't have a valid solution.

Step 2: Calculate the number of tins of dog food that Kimberly bought.
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contained 6 tins, so the total number of tins of dog food is: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins. {Now we know: 88 tins of cat food and 36 tins of dog food.}

Step 3: Determine the difference in the number of tins between cat and dog food.

- Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kaguyami
- Kaguyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay
- Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei
- Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch

Step 2: Let's first find out how high a mountain Pompei can lift in feet.
1 inch = 1 * 12 * 12 * 12 * 1000 = 1,728,000 cubic inches ( approximate value)
Since the density of a mountain is approximately 2700 kg/m3, 1 cubic inch is equivalent to approximately 1.57 * 10^-5 kg.
So, 1 inch of mountain mass is approximately 1.57 * 10^-5 kg.

Step 3: Let's find out how high a mountain Saskay can lift:
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher = 12 * 1 inch = 12 inches

Step 4: Let's find out how high a mountain Kaguyami can lift:
Kaguyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay = 4 * 1 inch = 4 inches

Step 5: Let's find out how high a mountain Naruto can lift:
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kaguyami = 10 * 4 inches = 40 inches

Step 6: Let's convert these values from inches to feet:
1 foot = 12 inches
Naruto can lift a mountain = 40 inches / 12 inches/foot = 3.33 feet

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many liters of milk one cow produces each day. Since one cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we don't need to find the milk production of the other two cows because we're only concerned with how many more cows are needed to reach a certain milk production level.

Step 2: Determine how much milk is needed each day. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day, so we can subtract the current milk production from this number.

Milk needed per day = 25 liters
Current milk production = 5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters

Difference in milk production needed = 25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters

Step 3: Calculate how many more cows are needed based on the current milk production per cow. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we can find out how many additional cows are needed to produce an extra 10 liters of milk each day.

Number of additional cows = Milk production difference / Milk production per cow.

Number of additional cows = 10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Isaias makes a profit of $2000 from selling chickens priced at $50 per chicken.
2. He has 300 chickens on his farm.
3. He plans to sell 3/5 or 60% of them (calculate 60% of 300): 60% of 300 = 180 chickens.
4. He makes a profit of $2000 from selling these 180 chickens.
5. To find the cost price of one chicken, first find out how much money he made selling all the chickens he planned to sell (180 chickens), and then subtract that amount from the total profit.
   - Total profit: $2000
   - Profit per chicken: $2000 / 180 chickens = $11.11 per chicken (approximately)
   - Since he sells chickens at $50, his cost price per chicken is $50 - $11.11 = $38.89 per chicken (approximately)

Therefore, the cost price of the chickens Isaias took to the market for sale was approximately $38.89.

                 [/INST] To find out how many yellow balloons there are in the bundle, we first need to determine how many pieces of bologna Benny used for each color of balloon.

1. Benny used 2 pieces of bologna for each red balloon.
2. Benny used 3 pieces of bologna for each yellow balloon.

Let's represent the number of red balloons with the variable ""r"" and the number of yellow balloons with the variable ""y"". We know that the total number of balloons in the bundle is 58, and the number of red balloons is 20.

The total number of balloons: 58
Number of red balloons: 20

Using the given information, we can write the following two equations:
1) r + y = 58
2) 2r + 3y = 116 (Since Benny used 116 pieces of bologna in total)

Now, we'll solve the system of equations:
First, we'll try to isolate r from equation (1).
r = 58 - y

Next, we'll isolate y from equation (2).
3y = 116 - 2r

Substitute r = 58 - y into the second equation:
3y = 116 - 2(58 - y)

Solve for y:
3y = 116 - 116 + 2y
3y = 2y
y = 3y/2
y = 3/2 * 58/2
y = 3/2 * 29
y = 48.5

Step 1: Find out how many bottles the teacher got with her 9 coupons.
Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, the teacher got:

Number of bottles = Coupons * Bottles per coupon

Pamela uses ounce(s) ? of sunscreen every hour. So, the amount of sunscreen she uses in one hour is ounce(s) ?.

Step 2: Determine how much sunscreen Pamela uses in total during her vacation.
Pamela will be outside for 4 hours a day over 8 days. Therefore, she will use sunscreen for a total of 4 hours/day × 8 days = 32 hours. Since she uses ounce(s) ? of sunscreen every hour, she will use ounce(s) ? × 32 hours = ounce(s) 32 during her vacation.

Step 3: Determine how many 8-ounce bottles Pamela will need to pack.
To find out how many 8-ounce bottles Pamela will need, divide the total amount of sunscreen she needs by the size of one bottle: ounce(s) 32 ÷ ounce(s) 8 = bottle(s) 4.

However, since Pamela can't buy a fraction of a bottle, she will need to pack 5 bottles to have enough sunscreen for her vacation. {The final answer is 5 bottles}</s>",4,4.0,5.0

                 [/INST] First, we need to find the distance between San Diego, California, and New York City, New York. According to Google Maps, the approximately driving distance between these two cities is about 4,046.4 kilometers. {The distance between San Diego, California, and New York City, New York, is approximately 4,046.4 kilometers.}

Next, we are given that Bernice drove for 4 days and covered a distance of 325 kilometers per day. So, she covered a total distance of 325 kilometers/day × 4 days = 1,300 kilometers.

Now, we need to subtract the distance Bernice has already driven from the total driving distance between San Diego and New York City to find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive.

Total driving distance between San Diego and New York City = 4,046.4 kilometers
Distance Bernice has already driven = 1,300 kilometers

So, the remaining distance for Bernice to drive is = Total driving distance between San Diego and New York City - Distance Bernice has already driven

The problem states that ""two hours after the trucks had departed, Mr. Hezekiah got the news that a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures."" This means that 1/4 of the 20 trucks had mechanical issues.

Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 trucks * 1/4
= 5 trucks

Step 2: Determine the number of tons of fertiliser in each truck that reached the farmers.
The problem states that ""Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser"", so no tons of fertiliser were lost due to mechanical failures on the road.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers.
To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we simply multiply the number of trucks that didn't have mechanical issues by the amount of fertiliser each truck carried.

Total tons of fertiliser = Number of trucks without mechanical failures * Amount of fertiliser per truck

Step 1: Find the time it takes James to walk half the distance (2 miles) at 4 miles per hour:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

Step 2: Since James had to walk back to the store, the total distance he covered was 4 miles * 2 = 8 miles. The time it took him for the round trip is thus:

1. The weight of Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
   Weight of Elijah's first dog = (1/4) * Weight of Kory's dog
   Weight of Elijah's first dog = (1/4) * 60 pounds

2. Solving this equation, we get:
   Weight of Elijah's first dog = 15 pounds

3. The weight of Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   Weight of Elijah's second dog = 1/2 * Weight of Kory's dog
   Weight of Elijah's second dog = 1/2 * 60 pounds

4. Solving this equation, we get:
   Weight of Elijah's second dog = 30 pounds

5. To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we add the weights of both dogs:
   Total weight of Elijah's dogs = Weight of Elijah's first dog + Weight of Elijah's second dog
   Total weight of Elijah's dogs = 15 pounds + 30 pounds

6. Solving this equation, we get:

                    A company bought $400000 worth ; of . equipment from . a retailer . business, but pieces : of equipment worth 40% of the total number were faulty. If , they returned : the faulty pieces of equipment ? to ? the : seller, ! calculate the total amount of money spent ? on functioning ! pieces of equipment.
                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that the company bought $400,000 worth of equipment in total.

Step 2: The problem states that 40% of the equipment was faulty. To find the number of faulty pieces, we can calculate 40% of the total number of pieces:

40% of total pieces = total pieces × 0.4
total pieces = total pieces × 1 / 0.4
total pieces = total pieces × 2.5

Assuming there are a whole number of pieces in total, we can round up to the nearest whole number:

total pieces = Math.ceil(total pieces × 2.5)

Step 3: Since there are faulty pieces, there must also be functioning pieces. To find the number of functioning pieces, we can subtract the number of faulty pieces from the total number of pieces:

functioning pieces = total pieces - faulty pieces
functioning pieces = total pieces - Math.ceil(total pieces × 0.4)

Step 4: The problem asks us to find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment. Since we know that the total cost of the equipment was $400,000 and we have found the number of functioning pieces, we can calculate the cost per piece and then multiply it by the number of functioning pieces:

cost per piece = total cost / total pieces
cost per piece = $400,000 / total pieces
cost per piece = $400,000 / (total pieces - faulty pieces)

functioning cost = cost per piece × number of functioning pieces
functioning cost = $400,000 / (total pieces - Math.ceil(total pieces × 0.4)) × (total pieces - Math.ceil(total pieces × 0.4))

{The final answer is $400,000 / (total pieces - 2x}, where x is the number of total pieces and can be found by trial and error. A calculator or computer algebra system may be necessary to determine the value of x that will make the equation equal to $400,000.

                 [/INST] To find out how much money was withheld from Sally's wage, we first need to determine how much wage she actually received this week. We know that her bank account started at $200 and ended at $420, and she received no other money into her account during the week.

Therefore, the difference between the beginning and ending balances of Sally's bank account represents the amount of her wage that was deposited into her account this week.

Let's calculate that difference:

$420 (ending balance) - $200 (beginning balance) = $220

So, Sally deposited $220 into her bank account from her wages this week. Since we know that her weekly wage should be $300, we can find out how much was withheld by subtracting the amount she actually received from her regular wage:

$300 (weekly wage) - $220 (amount deposited) = $80

To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies available for the nephews:

1. Susan made 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies. So there are now 96 cookies left for Susan's nephews.

                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many berries the sloth picks up and transports in one trip, in order to collect 24 berries within 8 hours.

The total time spent on making one trip is 4 hours (going down the tree + picking up berries + climbing back up the tree). Therefore, the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours (since 8 hours is twice the time it takes to make one trip).

Since each trip results in collecting a certain number of berries, that number must be sufficient to accumulate 24 berries in total within 8 hours.

Given that each trip takes 4 hours, we can compute the least number of berries the sloth must pick up during each trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours:

We know that the sloth makes 2 trips in 8 hours, so we need to divide the total number of berries he aims to collect by the number of trips: 24 berries ÷ 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Hence, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is {12}.

Therefore, the answer to this problem is that the sloth needs to pick up a minimum of 12 berries per trip if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.</s>",12,12.0,8.0

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Tyrion changes his mask twice every time he goes out.

Step 2: So, for each outing, Tyrion uses two masks.

Step 3: Therefore, in one day, with three outings, Tyrion uses:
 masks used in one day = outings per day * masks per outing
 masks used in one day = 3 * 2
 masks used in one day = 6 masks

Step 4: Two days consist of four8 hours:24 hours*2=48 hours. Since Tyrion goes out three times a day, in two days he will have:
outings in 2 days = outings per day * days
outings in 2 days = 3 * 2

1. We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so x = 2y.

Now we will find the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle using these relationships.

3. Substitute the expression for y from step 2 into the expression for x from step 1: x = 2(4z) = 8z.
4. We're given that Seattle has 20 sheep, so z = 20.

                 [/INST] To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine how many 16 ounce cans of tomatoes she used. We know that each can contains three tomatoes and that her last batch made 32 ounces of sauce.

1. First, we need to find out how many ounces there are in one can of tomatoes. We know that each can is 16 ounces, so:
   One can = 16 ounces

2. We also know that each can contains three tomatoes. However, the problem doesn't give us any information about the weight of one tomato. We can't directly calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the weight of the sauce alone.

3. Since the problem asks for the number of tomatoes and not the weight, we can assume that the tomatoes lose only volume, not weight, when they're cooked into sauce. This means that each tomato occupies half the volume it had before cooking when it's in the sauce.

4. Therefore, if one can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes and makes 16 ounces of sauce, then each tomato contributes half that amount, or 8 ounces, to the sauce. We can calculate the number of tomatoes in one can by dividing the weight of the can by the weight of one tomato as a fraction of the can's weight:

   Three tomatoes in one can = Total weight of three tomatoes
   One tomato = 8 ounces

   So, one tomato represents 8/3 of the weight of the can:
    One tomato = Total weight of three tomatoes / 3 = 16 oz / 3 ≈ 5.33 oz

5. Now that we know each tomato weighs approximately 5.33 oz, we can calculate the number of tomatoes in the 32 ounces (1 lb) of sauce that Freda made:

   Number of tomatoes = Weight of sauce / Weight of one tomato
   Number of tomatoes = 32 oz / 5.33 oz/tomato ≈ 6.22 * Number of tomatoes
   
   Since we can't have a fraction of a tomato, we must round up to get another whole tomato:

    Number of tomatoes = 7 Approx.

However, due to the initial approximation, this answer is not very accurate. The difference in weight between the actual tomatoes and the 1 lb used is not significant enough to impact the final calculation significantly. Therefore, we can round up to the nearest whole number of tomatoes, which is 7, with a minor error.

Step 2: A third of them quit after children vomit on them. To find out how many elves quit after vomiting, we calculate one-third of the initial number of elves: 60 * (1/3) = 20. So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them.

Step 3: Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after children kick their shins. To find out how many elves quit after kids kicked their shins, we subtract the number of elves who quit after vomiting from the total remaining elves. First, we find out how many elves remained after the first wave of quitting: 60 - 20 = 40. Then, we subtract the 10 elves who quit after kids kicked their shins: 40 - 10 = 30.

1. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 minutes in an hour.
2. Therefore, there are 6 intervals of 10 minutes in an hour.
3. Now, we need to find out how many intervals there are between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.

9. From 10:30 a.m. to 11 a.m. there are 30 minutes or 3 intervals of 10 minutes.
10. In total, there are: 3 intervals (from 8 a.m. to 8:30 a.m.) + 3 intervals (from 8:30 a.m. to 9 a.m.) + 3 intervals (from 9 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.) + 3 intervals (from 9:30 a.m. to 10 a.m.) + 3 intervals (from 10 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.) + 2 intervals (pausing between 10:30 a.m. and 11 a.m.) = 15 intervals

Now that we know there are 15 intervals, we can calculate how much money Susan earns during this time.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of onions that Sophia bought as x. Then, the number of onions that Rose bought was 4x.

Given that Rose bought 12 onions, we can write the equation: 12 = 4x

To find the value of x, we need to solve for x:

x = 12 / 4 = 3

So, Sophia bought 3 onions.

To find the number of potatoes that Sophia bought, we know that Rose bought 4 times as many potatoes as Sophia bought onions. Since Sophia bought 3 onions, Rose bought:

4 * 3 = 12 potatoes

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 12 * 4 = 48 potatoes.

{The final answer is: Sophia bought 3 onions and 48 potatoes.}</s>",4,4.0,48.0

                    A , cat eats nine sausages in 30 ! minutes. A dog can ! eat the same number ? of sausages in ? 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes. Calculate ? the . average time : the two , take : the : eat the sausages.
                 [/INST] First, let's find out how long it takes for the cat to eat nine sausages. We're given that the cat consumes nine sausages in 30 minutes. Hence, the time it takes for the cat to eat one sausage is:

Time for cat to eat one sausage = Time for cat to eat nine sausages / Number of sausages
Time for cat to eat one sausage = 30 minutes / 9

Time for cat to eat one sausage = 3.33 minutes (approximately)

Now we'll determine how long it takes for the dog to eat the same number (nine) of sausages but in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat.

Time for dog to eat nine sausages = Time it takes the cat to eat nine sausages * 2/3
Time for dog to eat nine sausages = 30 minutes * 2/3

Time for dog to eat nine sausages = 20 minutes

Since the dog consumes nine sausages in 20 minutes, we can figure out the time it takes for the dog to eat one sausage:

Time for dog to eat one sausage = Time for dog to eat nine sausages / Number of sausages
Time for dog to eat one sausage = 20 minutes / 9

Time for dog to eat one sausage = 2.22 minutes (approximately)

To find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat one sausage, we'll take the average of their respective times:

Average time for cat and dog to eat one sausage = (Time for cat to eat one sausage + Time for dog to eat one sausage) / 2
Average time for cat and dog to eat one sausage = (3.33 minutes + 2.22 minutes) / 2

Average time for cat and dog to eat one sausage = 2.83 minutes

{The final answer is: The average time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat one sausage is approximately 2.83 minutes.}</s>",25,25.0,2.83

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha had as M, and the number of notebooks Joseph had as J. We're given the following information:

1. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so J = 3M.
2. Martha bought 5 more notebooks, making her new total number of notebooks M + 5.

Now we want to find the difference between the number of notebooks Martha has and the number of notebooks Joseph has:

The difference in the number of notebooks is M + 5 - J = M + 5 - (3M) = M + 5 - 3M = 2M - 3M = -M.

Since the difference is negative, it means that Joseph had more notebooks than Martha initially, and now Martha has more. But the question asks for the difference in the opposite direction, so we need to find the absolute value of the difference, which is M.

{The final answer is M.}

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the total number of lollipops sold by each student.
Each student sold on average 10 lollipops. So, the total number of lollipops sold by all 30 students is:
Total lollipops sold = Number of students * Average number of lollipops sold per student
Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops
Total lollipops sold = 300 lollipops

Step 2: Find the profit made on each lollipop sold.
The students sold lollipops for $0.8 each, and they bought them for $0.5 each. So, the profit made on each lollipop sold is:
Profit per lollipop = Selling price - Buying price
Profit per lollipop = $0.8 - $0.5
Profit per lollipop = $0.3

Step 3: Find the total profit made from selling all the lollipops.
Total profit = Total number of lollipops sold * Profit per lollipop
Total profit = 300 lollipops * $0.3/lollipop

                 [/INST] To determine how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can stand while still able to hit it with the javelin, we need to find out how far she can throw the javelin with and without the gemstone.

Given:
- Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone.
- Polly can throw the javelin 3 times farther with the gemstone.

Calculation:
- The distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is 400 feet × 3 = 1200 feet.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of years it takes for Comet Halley to orbit the sun as T. We know that T = 75 years.

We also know that Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Let's call this year F. So, F = 30 + 75 * k, where k is the number of orbits since the first recorded observation.

Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was at the first observation. Let's call the year Bill saw the comet B. So, B = 3 * (F + T).

Substituting F = 30 + 75 * k into the equation for B, we get:
B = 3 * (30 + 75 * k + 75)

Now, let's find the value of k. We know that the time between Bill's and his father's observations is twice the orbital period, T. So,
B - F = 2 * T
Substituting F = 30 + 75 * k, we have:
B - (30 + 75 * k) = 2 * 75

Solution:
Step 1: Solve for k.
k = ((B - 30) / 75) - 1

Step 2: Find Bill's age at the first observation.
F = 30 + 75 * k
Age of Bill's father at first observation = 30
Age of Bill at first observation = F - 30

Substituting the value of F in terms of k from Step 1 in the equation above, we get:
Age of Bill at first observation = (75 * k + 30) - 30 = 75 * k

                 [/INST] Let's find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk on average to make the total daily exercise for Bernie's dogs equal to 3 miles per day.

First, let's find the total miles needed for the first three dogs:

1. The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
2. The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
3. The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

Total miles for the first three dogs = 1 mile (for the first dog) + 4 miles (for the second dog) + 3 miles (for the third dog) = 8 miles

Since the total daily exercise for Bernie's dogs should be 3 miles, we need to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk on average to make up for the 5 miles (8 miles for the three dogs - 3 miles for the daily average):

Miles for the last dog = Total miles for all dogs - Miles for the first three dogs
Miles for the last dog = 3 miles (daily average) * Number of dogs - 8 miles (for the first three dogs)
                                 = 3 miles/dog * 4 dogs - 8 miles
                                 = 12 miles - 8 miles

- The singer has 50 microphones.
- We want to find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged.
- To find the number of pairs, we need to divide the total number of microphones by 2.

Number of pairs = Total microphones / 2
Number of pairs = 50 / 2
Number of pairs = 25

Step 2: Calculate how many microphones will not be able to fit in pairs.
- We know that 20% of the microphones won't find any space.
- To find this number, calculate 20% of the total microphones.

Microphones not fitting in pairs = Total microphones * 0.2
Microphones not fitting in pairs = 50 * 0.2
Microphones not fitting in pairs = 10

Step 3: Subtract the number of microphones that won't fit in pairs from the total number of pairs.

Number of pairs that can be arranged = Number of pairs calculated in Step 1 - Microphones not fitting in pairs calculated in Step 2
Number of pairs that can be arranged = 25 - 10
Number of pairs that can be arranged = 15

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in one box for Peter as x.
Then, the number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha is y.

From the problem statement, we know that:

Peter has 4 boxes with x chocolate bars each.
Martha has 7 boxes with y chocolate bars each.

The total number of chocolate bars for Peter is 4x (since there are 4 boxes with x chocolate bars each), and for Martha, it is 7y (since there are 7 boxes with y chocolate bars each).

Step 2: Use the information given about the total number of chocolate bars for Peter and Martha to set up an equation.

We know that:
4x = 64 (Total number of chocolate bars Peter has)
And,
7y = 56 (Total number of chocolate bars Martha has)

Step 3: Solve the equation for x (the number of chocolate bars in Peter's box) and y (the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box).

Let's start by solving the equation for x:
4x = 64
x = 64 / 4
x = 16

Now, let's solve the equation for y:
7y = 56
y = 56 / 7
y = 8

Step 4: Find the difference in the number of chocolate bars between Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Since there are x chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes and y chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes, the difference in the number of chocolate bars is given by (x - y).

From Step 3, we have x = 16 and y = 8.

So, the difference in the number of chocolate bars between Peter's and Martha's boxes is:

16 (Number of chocolate bars in Peter's box) - 8 (Number of chocolate bars in Martha's box) = 8

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of sweets in the box.
Since there are 15 packs in the box and each pack has 60 pieces, then the total number of pieces in the box is:
15 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of packs Anne kept.
The problem states that Anne kept two packs. So, the number of packs she kept is:
2 packs

Step 3: Calculate the number of packs Anne gave to her friends.
The total number of packs in the box is 15. Since Anne kept 2 packs, then the number of packs she gave to her friends is:
15 packs (in the box) - 2 packs (Anne kept) = 13 packs

Step 4: Calculate the number of pieces each friend received.
There are a total of 10 friends, and the number of pieces in 1 pack is 60. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:
60 pieces/pack / 10 friends = 6 pieces/friend

The final answer is: Each friend received 6 pieces of sweets.</s>",78,78.0,6.0

Step 2: At 10:00 am, 40 more people entered, bringing the total to M + 40.

Step 3: Later in the day, 2 times the number of people who came in at 10:00 entered. So, an additional 2(M + 40) people came in.

Step 4: By evening, 3 times the original number of people had entered, so we have M + 40 + 3M.

Step 5: To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, add the number of people who came in the morning, at 10:00 am, and in the evening:

Total number of people = M + 40 + 3M

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So the cost price of each watermelon is:

Cost price = Total cost / Number of watermelons
Cost price = $80 / 50
Cost price = $1.6

Step 2: Find the selling price of each watermelon.
The vendor sold all the watermelons at a profit of 25%. Therefore, the selling price of each watermelmelon is:

Selling price = Cost price * (1 + Profit percentage)
Selling price = $1.6 * (1 + 0.25)
Selling price = $1.6 * 1.25
Selling price = $2

Step 2: Each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is: 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Step 3: Since Henry and 4 friends are going to share the pizzas equally, the number of slices each person gets is the total number of slices divided by the number of people: 56 slices / (Henry + 4 friends) = 56 slices / 5 people = 11.2 slices/person. However, since it's not possible to divide a pizza into 11.2 slices, we need to find an alternative way to divide the slices evenly. One solution is to allow Henry to have an extra slice.

Step 4: If Henry takes one extra slice, then we have enough slices for the 5 people. The number of slices each person gets is: 55 slices / 5 people = 11 slices/person.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many pieces of candy each person will have after one day.
Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so she will have 100 - 4 = <ins>96</ins> pieces of candy left after one day.
Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so she will have 100 - 3 = <ins>97</ins> pieces of candy left after one day.

2. Next, we need to find out how many pieces of candy each person will have after two weeks. One week has 7 days, so two weeks have 14 days in total.

Ginger's candy after two weeks = Initial candy amount * (1 - Dailyconsumption / Totaldays)
Ginger's candy after two weeks = 100 * (1 - 4 / 14) = 100 * (7 / 14) = <ins>64.29...</ins> pieces. Since we cannot have a fraction of a piece, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, Ginger will have 64 pieces of candy after two weeks.

Amy's candy after two weeks = Initial candy amount * (1 - Dailyconsumption / Totaldays)
Amy's candy after two weeks = 100 * (1 - 3 / 14) = 100 * (11 / 14) = <ins>71.43...</ins> pieces. Again, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, Amy will have 71 pieces of candy after two weeks.

3. To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we can subtract the amount of candy Ginger has after two weeks from the amount of candy Amy has after two weeks.

Difference in candy = Amy's candy after two weeks - Ginger's candy after two weeks = 71 - 64 = <ins>7</ins>.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the given information.
Alice has more books than Steven. Clara has twice as many books as Steven. Clara has 20 books.

Step 2: Find out how many books Steven has.
We know that Clara has 20 books and has twice as many books as Steven. So, Steven has half as many books as Clara: Steven = Clara / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10 books.

Step 3: Find out how many books Alice has.
Alice has more books than Steven, so Alice > 10 books.

Step 4: Calculate the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice.
Clara has 20 books and Alice has more. The difference in their number of books is: Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books = 20 - Alice's books.

Step 5: Find the value of Alice's books that makes the difference equal to a desired value.
Let's assume that we want to find the difference in books between Clara and Alice to be 5 books more. In that case, we set up the equation: Difference = 20 - Alice's books = 5. Solving for Alice's books, we get: Alice's books = 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Step 6: Check if the solution is reasonable.
In this case, it's reasonable since Alice has more books than Steven (10 books), and Clara has 2 more books than Alice (15 - 13 = 2).

The final answer is: Alice has 13 books, and Clara has 15 books, making a difference of 2 books.</s>",4,4.0,2.0

                 [/INST] To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the number of beads needed to fill the space between 8 topaz gemstones that add up to a total length of 25 inches.

Let's denote the number of beads between each gemstone as ""x."" Since there are 8 topaz gemstones and each one is 1 inch long, the total length of gemstones is 8 inches. Therefore, the total length of the beads that fill the space between the gemstones and make up the rest of the necklace must be 17 inches (25 inches total length - 8 inches gemstones length).

Next, let's calculate the number of beads (x) needed between one pair of gemstones:
1 inch (one gemstone) + x inches (beads between the gemstones) + 1 inch (next gemstone) = 2 inches (length of one pair of gemstones and beads)

Subtract the length of one gemstone (1 inch) from this equation:
x inches (beads between the gemstones) = 1 inch (gemstone length)

Now, we need to find out how many beads of one-quarter inch long make up one inch.
1 inch = 4 beads of one-quarter inch long

Multiply the number of beads (x) between one pair of gemstones by the number of beads per inch to find the total number of beads in one pair of gemstones and beads:
4 beads per inch * x inches = x * 4 beads

Since there are 8 pairs of gemstones and beads in a necklace, we multiply the number of beads in one pair by 8:
Total beads in a necklace = x * 4 beads/pair * 8 pairs = 32x beads

The total length of beads is 17 inches:
Total length of beads = 17 inches = 32x/2 fifths (divide by 2 to get the number of beads for half an inch)

Solving for x:
x = 17 inches * (2/32 beads/inch) = 1 inch * (2/4) = 1/2 inch

The number of beads between each gemstone is 1/2 inch, and since one bead is one-quarter inch long:
Number of beads between one pair of gemstones = 1/2 inch / (1/4 inch/bead) = 2 beads

Now, since there are 8 pairs of gemstones in a necklace:
Total number of beads in a necklace = 8 * 2 beads = 16 * 2 = 32 beads

1. The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples.
2. However, only 9 students wanted fruit for their lunches.

First, let's find out how many apples were ordered in total:
Total apples ordered = Red apples + Green apples
Total apples ordered = 42 + 7
Total apples ordered = 49

Next, let's calculate how many apples were needed for the 9 students:
Apples needed for students = Number of students * Average apples per student
Assuming each student eats one apple, so the average apples per student is 1.
Apples needed for students = 9 * 1
Apples needed for students = 9

Now we'll determine how many apples were used by the students:
Apples used by students = Apples needed for students
Apples used by students = 9

Finally, we'll calculate how many apples the cafeteria ended up having extra:

We know she finished 40 problems in total. Let's assume the number of math problems she finished at school was x, and the number of science problems she finished at school was y.

Given:
Total number of math problems = 46
Total number of science problems = 9
Number of problems Faye finished at school = 40

We know that the sum of the number of math problems and science problems she finished at school must be equal to 40, so we can write the equation: x + y = 40

Let's find out how many math problems she finished at school and how many science problems she finished at school.

First, let's check if it's possible for Faye to finish all her math problems (46) at school. If this is the case, she would have no math problems left to do for homework. In other words, x = 46.

However, this is not possible since, according to the problem, she finished 40 problems at school in total.

To find a solution, let's assume that Faye finished a certain number of math problems at school and use the equation x + y = 40 to find the unknowns.

Let's assume that Faye finished 'a' math problems at school, and she had 'b' math problems left to do for homework. Then, the total number of math problems would be 46, and she would have finished 40 at school and b for homework. So,

46 = a + b

Likewise, let s be the number of science problems she finished at school, and c be the number of science problems left to do for homework, we have:

9 + s = c

Since we don't have enough information to determine a and s, we cannot directly answer how many problems Faye has left to do for homework. We only know that she had 46 math problems and 9 science problems for homework, finished 40 in total during school hours, and there are certain numbers of math and science problems left to be done for homework. We don't know the exact distribution of problems between math and science.

Thus, the problem lacks enough information to calculate the answer. To provide a final answer, at least one more piece of information is required.

1. Tom won 32 tickets playing 'whack a mole'.
2. He won an additional 25 tickets playing 'skee ball'.
3. Tom spent 7 tickets on a hat.

To find out how many tickets Tom has left, we need to subtract the number of tickets he spent on the hat from the total number of tickets he won.

1. The total number of tickets Tom won is 32 (from 'whack a mole') + 25 (from 'skee ball') = <<32+25=57>>57 tickets.
2. Tom spent 7 tickets on a hat.
3. Therefore, Tom has 57 (total tickets) - 7 (tickets spent on a hat) = <<57-7=50>>50 tickets left.

                 [/INST] To find out how many pictures Zoe has left to color, we first need to determine how many pictures she has colored so far. The problem states that she has colored ""20 of the"" pictures after one week. However, it doesn't explicitly mention which coloring book these 20 pictures are from. We'll assume that the number of pictures in each coloring book is denoted by ""x"" and ""y"" respectively.

Let's analyze the given information:
1) Zoe bought two coloring books, one had 44 pictures and the other had 44 pictures.
2) After one week, she had colored 20 pictures.

Since we don't know which coloring book the 20 pictures belong to, let's assume that ""a"" number of pictures from one coloring book have been colored, and ""b"" number of pictures from the other coloring book have been colored. Then:

a + b = 20 (Since she has colored a total of 20 pictures)

We know that one coloring book has 44 pictures, but we don't have enough information to determine the exact number of pictures she has colored from each book. To solve this problem, let's try different combinations of pictures colored from each book to see which one satisfies the given condition:

If she colored all 20 pictures from the 44-picture coloring book, then:

a = 20
b = 0

However, if she colored all 20 pictures from the other 44-picture coloring book, then:

a = 0
b = 20

Neither of these combinations satisfy the given condition that both coloring books have at least 24 pictures left to be colored (since neither combination leaves us with that many pictures).

Therefore, based on the given information, it is impossible to determine the exact number of pictures Zoe has left to color. {The final answer is: Insufficient information provided to find the number of pictures Zoe has left to color.}</s>",68,68.0,24.0

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that the pet store had 12 Siamese cats and 20 house cats before the sale. So the total number of cats was: 12 (Siamese) + 20 (house) = 32 cats

Step 2: During the sale, they sold 20 cats. But we don't know if all the cats sold were of the same type (Siamese or house). Let's assume all cats sold were of one type for simplicity. We'll use two scenarios, one for each type of cat.

Scenario 1: All cats sold were Siamese cats. In this case, the number of Siamese cats before the sale was 12 and they sold 20 Siamese cats during the sale. So the number of Siamese cats left would be: 12 (initial) - 20 (sold) = -8

Since the number of cats cannot be negative, this scenario is not possible.

Scenario 2: All cats sold were house cats. In this case, the number of house cats before the sale was 20 and they sold 20 house cats during the sale. So the number of house cats left would be: 20 (initial) - 20 (sold) = 0

Again, since the number of cats cannot be zero, this scenario is also not possible.

Step 3: To find a valid solution, we need to assume that some of each type of cat were sold. Let's say they sold x Siamese cats and y house cats during the sale.

Then, the number of cats left would be: (12 (Siamese) - x) + (20 (house) - y)

Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact numbers of Siamese and house cats sold, we cannot provide an exact answer.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of apples the cafeteria ordered.
The cafeteria ordered 43 red apples and 32 green apples.
Total number of apples = Red apples + Green apples
Total number of apples = 43 + 32
Total number of apples = 75

Step 2: Calculate the number of apples needed if only 2 students wanted fruit.
If only 2 students wanted fruit, then the cafeteria would need to prepare apples for those 2 students.
Number of apples for 2 students = Apples per student
Number of apples for 2 students = 2 * Apples per student

Step 3: Find out how many apples are surplus to requirements.
Surplus apples = Total number of apples - Number of apples for 2 students
Surplus apples = 75 - 2 * Apples per student

In order to find the value of Apples per student, we need more information as it was not given in the question. Therefore, I cannot find the exact number of surplus apples. However, the formula to calculate the number of surplus apples is given above.

Step 1: Find the number of carrots picked by Haley.
The text says ""Haley picked 39 carrots.""

Step 2: Find the number of carrots picked by Haley's mom.
The text says ""her mother picked 38,"" so her mother picked 38 carrots.

Step 3: Find the total number of carrots picked.
Total carrots picked = Carrots picked by Haley + Carrots picked by her mom
Total carrots picked = 39 + 38 = 77

Step 4: Find the number of good carrots.
The text says ""If only 64 of the carrots were good,"" which means there were 64 good carrots.

Step 5: Find the number of bad carrots.
First, find the number of bad carrots by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked:

                 [/INST] To find out how many points Emily had at the end of the game, we need to find her total score by adding the number of points she scored in the first and second rounds and then subtracting the number of points she lost in the last round.

First, let's calculate Emily's total score:

Total score = Points in the first round + Points in the second round - Points lost in the last round

= 16 + 33 - 48

= 16 + 33 - (1 + 47)

= 16 + 33 - 48

= 49

However, we made a mistake in the calculation above. We should have subtracted 48 from the sum of points in the first and second rounds instead of adding it. Here's how to do it correctly:

Total score = Points in the first round + Points in the second round - Points lost in the last round

= 16 + 33 - 48

= 16 + 33 - (-48)

= 16 + 33 + 48

= 97

So, we made an error of 94 points, and the actual total score is 97 points.

Total number of apples = Red apples + Green apples
= 33 red apples + 23 green apples
= 56 apples

Step 2: Calculate how many apples were ordered for each student.
Apples per student = Total number of apples / Number of students
= 56 apples / 54 students
≈ 1.04 apples per student

Since it's not possible for each student to receive a fraction of an apple, it's clear that there was an excess order of apples.

Step 3: Determine how many apples were ordered extra for the students who didn't want fruit.
Extra apples = Total number of apples - Apples for students who wanted fruit
= 56 apples - (Apples for 21 students)

First, let's calculate how many apples would have been distributed among the 21 students that wanted fruit:

Apples for 21 students = Apples per student * Number of students
= 1.04 apples per student * 21 students
≈ 21.41 apples

Since it's not possible to distribute 0.41 apples, we'll round this number up to 22 apples.

Step 2: For his birthday, he received an additional 50 dollars. We calculate his new total by adding the 50 dollars to his initial amount: 35 + 50 = <<35+50=85>>85 dollars.

Step 3: However, the problem includes an error in the text, where it states that Oliver spent 84 dollars on a new game. But the number he spent, 84, is inconsistent with the given initial amount (35 dollars) and the additional amount he received for his birthday (50 dollars). Given the information provided, Oliver shouldn't have spent 84 dollars, and thus, there's an inconsistency with the presented information. Therefore, we cannot proceed with the calculation without correcting this inconsistency.

Step 4: Assuming the inconsistency is corrected and Oliver indeed spent 84 dollars on the new game, we find his current amount by subtracting the 84 dollars from his initial total after the birthday: 85 - 84 = <<85-84=1>>1 dollar remains.

                 [/INST] To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with when 51 students wanted fruit instead of the ordered amount for 37 red apples and 45 green apples, we first need to calculate the total number of apples ordered and then find out how many apples would have been enough for 51 students.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of apples ordered.
Red apples: 37
Green apples: 45
Total number of apples = Red apples + Green apples
Total number of apples = 37 + 45
Total number of apples = 82

Step 2: Find out how many apples would have been enough for 51 students.
Let x be the number of red apples and y be the number of green apples for 51 students.
x + y = 51 (since there are 51 students)

We want to minimize the number of apples while still having enough for 51 students. Since red apples take priority in the question, we want to minimize the number of green apples.

Let's try to find the minimum possible number of green apples that would satisfy the equation x + y = 51.

y = 51 - x
y = 51 - (37 - x) (substitute x = 37 - y)
y = 51 - 37 + x
y = 14 + x

Now we want to find the smallest integer value for x such that 14 + x >= 45 (number of green apples originally ordered). We find that x = 30 satisfies this condition:

14 + x = 14 + 30 = 44

So the minimum number of green apples for 51 students is 44. And the minimum total number of apples needed for 51 students is the sum of the number of red apples (37) and the minimum number of green apples found (44):

Total number of apples for 51 students = 37 + 44
Total number of apples for 51 students = 81

Step 3: Find the extra apples.
Extra apples = Total apples ordered - Total apples needed for 51 students
Extra apples = 82 - 81
Extra apples = 1

However, since integers cannot represent a fraction of an apple, the question seems to have a discrepancy or error. If we take it as is, the answer would be 1 extra apple. But in reality, it is impossible for there to be just 1 extra apple with the given numbers.

Thus, the given problem seems to contain inconsistent data and needs to be refined before providing an accurate solution.

                 [/INST] To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with when only 5 students wanted fruit, we first need to calculate the number of apples ordered for all students and then find the difference between that and the number of apples wanted by the 5 students.

1. The cafeteria ordered 6 red apples for each student, so they ordered a total of:
   Red apples = 6 apples/student * number of students
2. They also ordered 15 green apples for each student, so the total number of green apples ordered is:
   Green apples = 15 apples/student * number of students
3. Let's assume the number of students is x. So, the total number of apples ordered is:
   Total apples = Red apples + Green apples = 6x + 15x
4. However, only 5 students wanted fruit. So, the number of apples needed for their lunches is:
   Apples for 5 students = Red apples + Green apples = 6 * 5 + 15 * 5

Now, we'll find the difference between the total number of apples ordered and the number of apples needed for the 5 students:

5. ExTRA apples = Total apples - Apples for 5 students
6. Substitute the expressions for Total apples and Apples for 5 students from steps 3 and 4 into the equation:
   ExTRA apples = (6x + 15x) - (6 * 5 + 15 * 5)
7. Simplifying the equation: ExTRA apples = 6x + 15x - 30 - 75

1. The waiter had 39 customers to start with.
2. Another 12 customers were added to that number during the lunch rush.

Total number of customers = Initial number of customers + Customers added during the lunch rush
Total number of customers = 39 + 12
Total number of customers = 51

However, the question states that 49 of the customers didn't leave a tip. Therefore, we need to find out how many customers did leave a tip by subtracting the number of non-tipping customers from the total number of customers.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We know that the waiter had 26 customers to wait on initially.
2. Then, during the lunch rush, another 27 customers arrived, making the total number of customers 53 (26 + 27).
3. We're told that 27% of the customers didn't leave a tip. So, we need to find 27% of the total number of customers to determine how many didn't tip.
4. To calculate 27% of 53, first find 27% of 53 as a decimal value: 0.27 * 53 = 14.37
5. Since there cannot be a fraction of a customer, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. So, 14 customers didn't leave a tip.
6. To find out how many customers did leave a tip, we subtract the number of customers who didn't tip from the total number of customers: 53 (total customers) - 14 (customers who didn't tip) = 40

                 [/INST] To find out how many pastries Wendy sold at the bake sale, we first need to determine how many cupcakes and cookies she made and kept back.

1. Wendy made 41 cupcakes.
2. Wendy made 31 cookies.
3. After the sale, she had 32 pastries left at home.

Let's find out how many of each she kept back:
1. Cupcakes kept back: 41 (total made) - x (sold) = 37 - x
2. Cookies kept back: 31 (total made) - y (sold) = 28 - y

Both of these equations should equal the total number of pastries she had left after the sale, which is 32. So we can write the following system of linear equations:

37 - x + 28 - y = 32

To solve this system of equations, we can add the coefficients of x and y to find the constant term, and then subtract the constant term from both sides. This will give us an equation in terms of x and y.

x + y = 11

Next, we can try different values for x and y to see which will result in a valid number of pastries remaining at home for Wendy. Let's try x = 29:

29 + y = 11
y = -9

Since we can't have a negative number of cookies sold, this solution is not valid. Let's try another value for x, such as x = 28:

28 + y = 11
y = 3

This solution results in a valid number of pastries sold, so Wendy sold 28 cupcakes and 31 - 3 = 28 cookies at the bake sale.

Therefore, {Wendy sold a total of 56 pastries (28 cupcakes and 28 cookies) at the bake sale}.</s>",40,40.0,28.0

                 [/INST] Step 1: Paige initially had x songs on her mp3 player. So the equation for the number of songs before deleting and adding new ones is:
x = 8 (given)

Step 2: Paige deleted 5 old songs. So the equation for the number of songs after deleting old ones is:
x - 5 = ?

Step 3: Paige added 30 new songs. So the equation for the number of songs after adding new ones is:
x - 5 + 30 = ?

Step 4: To find the final number of songs on Paige's mp3 player, we need to solve the equation from step 3:
x - 5 + 30 = x + n
x - 5 = x + n - 30
n = 35 (subtract 5 from both sides and then add 30 to both sides)

Step 5: Therefore, the final answer is:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the total number of carrots picked.
Carol picked 29 carrots, and her mom picked 16 carrots. So, the total number of carrots picked is:
Total carrots picked = Carrots picked by Carol + Carrots picked by her mom
Total carrots picked = 29 + 16
Total carrots picked = 45

Step 2: Subtract the number of good carrots from the total carrots picked to find the number of bad carrots.
The total number of carrots picked was 45, and only 38 good carrots were picked. So, the number of bad carrots picked is:
Bad carrots picked = Total carrots picked - Good carrots picked
Bad carrots picked = 45 - 38
Bad carrots picked = 7

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the number of shirts Oliver washed.
- He washed 39 short sleeve shirts.
- He washed 47 long sleeve shirts.
- Total number of shirts washed = 39 (short sleeve) + 47 (long sleeve)
- Total number of shirts washed = 86

Step 2: Identify the number of shirts he didn't wash.
- He didn't wash 86 (total number of shirts) - 20 (number of shirts he washed)
- He didn't wash = 86 - 20 = 66 shirts.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many carrots Bianca and her mother picked in total. We know that Bianca picked 26 carrots and her mother picked 15. So,

Total carrots picked = Carrots picked by Bianca + Carrots picked by her mother
Total carrots picked = 26 + 15
Total carrots picked = 41

Step 2: Next, we are told that only 16 of the carrots were good. To find out how many bad carrots there were, we need to subtract the good carrots from the total carrots picked.

Bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Good carrots
Bad carrots = 41 - 16
Bad carroks = 25

The final answer is: They had 25 bad carrots.</s>",25,25.0,25.0

                 [/INST] To find out how many pastries Katie sold at the bake sale, we need to determine the number of cupcakes and cookies she made in total and then subtract the number of pastries she took home.

Step 1: Find the total number of pastries Katie made.
She made 7 cupcakes and 5 cookies. Therefore, the total number of pastries she made is:
Total pastries = Cupcakes + Cookies
= 7 + 5
= 12 pastries

Step 2: Subtract the number of pastries she took home to find out how many she sold.
She took home 8 pastries. So, the number of pastries she sold at the bake sale is:
Pastries sold = Total pastries - Pastries taken home
= 12 - 8
= 4 pastries

The final answer is: Katie sold 4 pastries at the bake sale.</s>",4,4.0,4.0

Step 2: Determine the number of good carrots.
Only 24 of the carrots were good.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bad carrots.
Number of bad carrots = Total number of carrots picked - Number of good carrots

                 [/INST] Step 1: We start with the information given that Oliver had 33 dollars in January.

Step 2: Next, we're told that Oliver spent 4 dollars by March. To find out how much money Oliver had left after his expenditure, we subtract the amount he spent from the original amount: 33 dollars (January) - 4 dollars (spending) = <<33-4=29>>29 dollars.

Step 3: Then, we learn that Oliver received an additional 32 dollars from his mom. To find out how much money Oliver now has, we add the new amount he received to the previous amount he had: 29 dollars (spent) + 32 dollars (gift) = <<29+32=61>>61 dollars.

                 [/INST] Step 1: The florist started with 37 roses.
Step 2: She sold 16 of them, so we subtract 16 from the initial number of roses.
37 roses (initial) - 16 roses (sold) = 21 roses remaining

Step 3: Afterwards, she bought 19 more roses. To find the new total number of roses, we add the number of roses she had remaining to the number of roses she bought.
21 roses (remaining) + 19 roses (bought) = 40 roses
