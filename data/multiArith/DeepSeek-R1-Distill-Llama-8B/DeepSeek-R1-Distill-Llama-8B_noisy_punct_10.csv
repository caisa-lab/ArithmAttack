                    question:
                     Paige ! had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how ; many songs ? does she have on her mp3 player? 
                 {I need to figure out how many songs Paige has on her mp3 player after deleting some and adding new ones. Let me break this down step by step.}

First, she started with 11 songs. Then she deleted 9 old songs. So, I should subtract those 9 from the original 11. Let me write that down: 11 minus 9. Hmm, that equals 2. So after deleting, she has 2 songs left.

But wait, after deleting, she adds 8 new songs. So I need to add those 8 to the remaining 2. That would be 2 plus 8, which is 10. So, putting it all together: 11 minus 9 is 2, plus 8 is 10. Therefore, she has 10 songs now.
</think>

Paige started with 11 songs on her mp3 player. Let's break down the changes step by step:

1. **Deleting Old Songs**:  
   Paige deleted 9 old songs.  
   Remaining songs after deletion = Original songs - Deleted songs  
   Remaining songs = 11 - 9 = 2

2. **Adding New Songs**:  
   She then added 8 new songs.  
   Total songs after addition = Remaining songs + Added songs  
   Total songs = 2 + 8 = 10

**Final Answer**: {The final answer is 10}.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",10
" There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the ! schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called back, how many ? students didn't make the ! cut? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the ! schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called back, how many ? students didn't make the ! cut? 
                 Okay, so I need to figure out how many students didn't make the cut when 39 girls and 4 boys tried out for the basketball team, and only 26 got called back. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should find out the total number of students trying out. There are 39 girls and 4 boys, so adding those together gives me 39 + 4 = 43 students in total.

Now, the problem says that only 26 of them got called back. So, I need to figure out how many students were not called back. To do that, I subtract the number of students who made it from the total number of students.

So, 43 total students minus 26 who made it equals 17 students who didn't make the cut.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem specifies 39 girls and 4 boys, but it doesn't say anything about the gender distribution of the 26 who made it. Does that affect the calculation? Hmm, I think it doesn't matter because the question is only asking for the total number of students who didn't make it, not how many boys or girls were cut. So, my initial calculation should be correct.

Therefore, the number of students who didn't make the cut is 17.
</think>

To determine how many students didn't make the cut, follow these steps:

1. **Find the total number of students trying out:**
   \[
   39 \text{ girls} + 4 \text{ boys} = 43 \text{ students}
   \]

2. **Subtract the number of students who made it from the total:**
   \[
   43 \text{ total students} - 26 \text{ who made it} = 17 \text{ who didn't make it}
   \]

**Answer:** 17 students didn't make the cut.

                <think>
First, I note that Faye initially has 34 coloring books.

She gives away 3 of them, which leaves her with 34 minus 3, resulting in 31 coloring books.

Next, she buys 48 more coloring books. Adding these to her remaining 31 gives her a total of 31 plus 48, which equals 79.

Therefore, after giving away 3 books and purchasing 48 additional ones, Faye has a total of 79 coloring books.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Faye initially has **34** coloring books.
- She gives away **3** coloring books.
- Then, she buys **48** more coloring books.

**Step 1:** Calculate the number of coloring books Faye has after giving away **3**.

\[
34 - 3 = 31
\]

**Step 2:** Add the **48** new coloring books she bought to the remaining **31**.

\[
31 + 48 = 79
\]

**Final Answer:**

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many apples the school cafeteria has.

**Step 1: Initial Number of Apples**
The cafeteria starts with **23 apples**.

**Step 2: Apples Used for Lunch**
They use **20 apples** to prepare lunch for the students.

**Step 3: Subtract the Apples Used**
Subtract the apples used from the initial number:
\[ 23 - 20 = 3 \]
So, after using 20 apples, there are **3 apples** left.

**Step 4: Buying Additional Apples**
The cafeteria buys **6 more apples** to replenish their stock.

**Step 5: Add the Additional Apples**
Add the newly bought apples to the remaining apples:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
Therefore, after purchasing the additional apples, the total number of apples the cafeteria has is **9**.

                    question:
                     Megan earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 14 bags, but didn't recycle 5 ! of them, how many points would ? she ; have earned? 
                 {The final number of points Megan earned is 8 points per bag multiplied by 13 bags, which equals 104 points. She didn't earn points for the 5 bags she didn't recycle. Therefore, the total points Megan earned are 104.}
</think><think>
First, I need to determine how many bags Megan recycled. She had a total of 14 bags but didn't recycle 5 of them. So, the number of bags she recycled is 14 minus 5, which equals 9 bags.

Next, I calculate the points Megan earned from recycling these 9 bags. She earns 8 points for each bag, so I multiply 9 bags by 8 points per bag.

Finally, I consider whether she earned points for the 5 bags she didn't recycle. Since she didn't recycle them, she also didn't earn points for those.

Therefore, the total points Megan earned are only from the 9 bags she recycled.
</think>

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many points Megan earned.

**Given:**
- Megan earns **8 points** for each bag of cans she recycles.
- She has **14 bags** of cans.
- She didn't recycle **5 bags**.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of bags Megan recycled.**
\[
\text{Bags recycled} = \text{Total bags} - \text{Bags not recycled} = 14 - 5 = 9
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total points Megan earned from recycling.**
\[
\text{Points earned} = \text{Points per bag} \times \text{Bags recycled} = 8 \times 9 = 72
\]

**Step 3: Determine if Megan earned points for the 5 bags she didn't recycle.**
Since Megan didn't recycle those 5 bags, she didn't earn points for them.

**Final Answer:**
Megan earned a total of **72 points**.

" April's discount flowers was having ! a sale where each rose was 4 dollars. If April started with 13 roses and had ; 4 roses left, how much : money did she earn? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     April's discount flowers was having ! a sale where each rose was 4 dollars. If April started with 13 roses and had ; 4 roses left, how much : money did she earn? 
                 Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how much money April earned from selling roses. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

Alright, the problem says that April's discount flower shop was having a sale where each rose was $4. She started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left. The question is, how much money did she earn?

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to determine how many roses she sold. She started with 13 and ended with 4. So, the number of roses she sold would be the difference between 13 and 4. Let me write that down.

Number sold = Starting roses - Roses left
Number sold = 13 - 4
Number sold = 9

So, she sold 9 roses. Now, each rose was $4, so the revenue from the sale would be the number sold multiplied by the price per rose. Let me calculate that.

Revenue = Number sold * Price per rose
Revenue = 9 * 4
Revenue = 36

Therefore, April earned $36 from selling the roses. Wait, let me double-check that. She had 13 roses initially, sold 9, and had 4 left. 9 times 4 is indeed 36. Yeah, that makes sense.

I don't think there are any other details in the problem that I'm missing. It's straightforward: she sold a certain number of roses at a fixed price, and we can calculate her total earnings from that.

Just to make sure, I'll think about it another way. If she had 13 roses and ended with 4, that means she sold 9. Each rose at $4, so 9 times 4 is $36. Yep, that's consistent.

I don't see any trick or hidden information in the problem. It seems pretty direct. So, I feel confident that $36 is the correct answer.
</think>

April started with 13 roses and had 4 left after the sale. The number of roses sold is 13 - 4 = 9. Each rose was sold for $4, so the total revenue is 9 * $4 = $36.

{The final answer is $36.}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",36

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash?

---

**Step 1: Understand the Total Number of Shirts to Wash**
- **Short sleeve shirts:** 9
- **Long sleeve shirts:** 21
- **Total shirts to wash:** \( 9 + 21 = 30 \)

---

**Step 2: Understand the Number of Shirts Washed**
- **Total washed:** 29

---

**Step 3: Determine the Number of Shirts Not Washed**
- **Number not washed = Total shirts to wash - Total washed**
- **Number not washed = \( 30 - 29 = 1 \)**

                <think>
To determine the number of tables needed, I first calculate the total number of people attending the luncheon by subtracting the 7 who didn't show up from the initial 47.

This gives me 40 people.

Next, I consider that each table can accommodate 5 people. To find out how many tables are required, I divide the total number of people by the number of people each table can hold.

So, 40 divided by 5 equals 8.

Therefore, the company needs 8 tables.
</think>

**Solution:**

We need to determine the number of tables required to seat the attendees at the luncheon.

1. **Total people invited:** 47

2. **Number of people who didn't show up:** 7

3. **Total people attending the luncheon:**  
   \( 47 - 7 = 40 \) people

4. **Number of people each table can accommodate:** 5

5. **Number of tables needed:**  
   \( \frac{40}{5} = 8 \)

" Tom had 5 books. If he sold 4 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books : would : Tom have? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Tom had 5 books. If he sold 4 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books : would : Tom have? 
                 {I think I need to figure out how many books Tom has after selling some and buying new ones. Let me break it down step by step.}

First, Tom has 5 books to start with. He sells 4 of them. So, he gets money from selling those 4 books. Then, he uses that money to buy 38 new books. So, the total number of books he has now would be the books he had after selling minus the ones he sold, plus the new ones he bought.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When he sells 4 books, he gains 4 books' worth, but he loses those 4 books. So, he has 5 - 4 = 1 book left. Then, he uses the money to buy 38 new books. So, he now has 1 book plus 38 new ones, which is 39 books. Hmm, that makes sense.

But wait, another way to look at it is: he started with 5, sold 4, so he has 1 left. Then he bought 38, so 1 + 38 = 39. So, yeah, 39 books in total.

Alternatively, maybe someone might think that selling 4 books gives him 4 times the money, and then buying 38 books, so 4 times the money would be 4 times the value of a book. But the question doesn't specify the value of the books, so perhaps it's assuming that each book is worth the same amount. So, maybe he sells 4 books for, say, x dollars, then buys 38 books with x dollars, so each book is x/38 dollars. But since the question is just about the number of books, not the money, maybe it's simpler.

So, regardless of the money, the number of books he has after selling 4 and buying 38 is 1 + 38 = 39.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick someone into thinking he ends up with 5 + 38 = 43, but that's not correct because he sold some books first. So, the correct answer is 39.

Another way: initial books = 5. After selling 4, he has 1. Then he buys 38, so total is 1 + 38 = 39.

Yeah, I think that's the right approach.
</think>

Tom started with 5 books. He sold 4, leaving him with 1. Then, he used the money from the sale to buy 38 new books. Therefore, the total number of books Tom has is 1 + 38 = 39.

To determine how many shelves Jerry needs to fill, I'll start by calculating the total number of sodas he has. He bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas, which makes a total of 63 sodas.

Each shelf can hold 9 sodas. To find out how many shelves are needed, I'll divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.

So, 63 divided by 9 equals 7. Therefore, Jerry needs 7 shelves to store all his sodas.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of sodas Jerry bought:**
   
   - Regular sodas: 41
   - Diet sodas: 22
   - **Total sodas = 41 + 22 = 63**

2. **Determine how many sodas each shelf can hold:**
   
   - Each shelf holds **9** sodas.

Emily was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 41 seeds. She planted 29 of them in the ""big garden"" and in each of her ""small gardens"" put 4 seeds each. How many small gardens did Emily have?
</problem>
Alright, so I need to figure out how many small gardens Emily has. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, she started with 41 seeds. Out of these, she planted 29 in the big garden. That means the remaining seeds went into the small gardens. So, I should subtract the number of seeds in the big garden from the total to find out how many seeds are left for the small gardens.

Calculating that, 41 minus 29 equals 12 seeds left. So, 12 seeds were planted in the small gardens.

Now, each small garden has 4 seeds each. So, to find out how many small gardens there are, I need to divide the total number of seeds in small gardens by the number of seeds per small garden.

That would be 12 divided by 4. Let me do that division: 12 divided by 4 is 3. So, that means there are 3 small gardens.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. She started with 41 seeds, used 29 for the big garden, leaving 12. Each small garden takes 4 seeds, so 12 divided by 4 is indeed 3. Yep, that seems right.

I don't think I missed anything. The problem didn't mention anything about different sizes or extra seeds, just the big garden and the small ones. So, yeah, 3 small gardens.
</think>

Emily started with 41 seeds. She used 29 of them in the big garden, leaving 12 seeds for the small gardens. Each small garden holds 4 seeds, so the number of small gardens is 12 divided by 4, which equals 3.

I start by determining the total number of candy pieces Emily has. She received 5 pieces from her neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister, which adds up to 18 pieces in total.

Next, I calculate how many days the candy will last by dividing the total number of pieces by the number she eats each day. Since she eats 9 pieces a day, I divide 18 by 9, which equals 2 days.

Therefore, the candy will last Emily for 2 days.

To determine how many shelves Mike needs, I first calculate the number of books he has after the librarian takes 10 away.

Starting with 82 books and subtracting the 10 taken by the librarian gives 72 books remaining.

Next, I consider how many books can be placed on each shelf. Mike can fit 9 books on a shelf.

Finally, I divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books each shelf can hold. Dividing 72 by 9 gives 8 shelves.

Therefore, Mike will need 8 shelves.

First, I need to determine the total number of pictures Nancy took during her vacation. She took 49 pictures at the zoo and 8 at the museum.

Next, I'll add these two amounts to find the total number of pictures she had. So, 49 plus 8 equals 57 pictures in total.

Then, Nancy deleted 38 pictures. To find out how many pictures she still has, I'll subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures.

Finally, subtracting 38 from 57 gives me 19 pictures that she still has.

                    question:
                     A : store had 40 ; oranges in a bin. : If they threw away 25 of the old ones and put 21 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin? 
                 Okay, so I have this problem here: A store had 40 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 25 of the old ones and put 21 new ones in the bin, how many would be in the bin? Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

First, I need to understand what's happening here. The store initially has 40 oranges in a bin. Then they threw away 25 of the old ones. So, they're removing some oranges, but then they also put 21 new ones in the bin. I guess I need to calculate the total number after these two actions.

Let me break it down step by step. Initially, there are 40 oranges. They throw away 25, so how many oranges are left? Well, 40 minus 25. Let me do that subtraction: 40 - 25 equals 15. So, after throwing away 25, there are 15 oranges left in the bin.

Now, they put 21 new oranges into the bin. So, I need to add 21 to the remaining 15 oranges. Let me add those together: 15 + 21. Hmm, 15 plus 20 is 35, and then plus 1 more is 36. So, adding those together gives me 36 oranges.

Wait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe I can consider it as a replacement or a net change. If they threw away 25 and added 21, the net change is 21 - 25, which is -4. So, subtracting 4 from the original 40 gives me 36 as well. Yeah, that matches what I got before.

Is there a chance I misread the problem? Let me check again. The store had 40 oranges. They threw away 25 old ones and put 21 new ones. So, the initial oranges were 40, then minus 25, then plus 21. So, 40 -25 is 15, plus 21 is 36. That seems correct.

I don't think I made a mistake in the calculations. So, the total number of oranges in the bin should be 36.
</think>

The store initially had 40 oranges. After throwing away 25, 15 remained. Adding 21 new oranges gives a total of 36.

{The final answer is} 36 oranges.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Start with 40 oranges.
2. Subtract 25 thrown away: 40 - 25 = 15.
3. Add 21 new oranges: 15 + 21 = 36.

Answer: 36 oranges.

                    question:
                     At lunch a waiter had 7 customers and 5 of them didn't leave a tip. If ; he got $3 each from the ones who , did tip, how much money did he earn? , 
                 ,,,,

</think>
Alright, let's try to figure out how much money the waiter earned. So, the problem is: At lunch, the waiter had 7 customers, and 5 of them didn't leave a tip. The ones who did leave a tip gave him $3 each. We need to find out how much money the waiter earned in total.

First, I'll break down the information given. There are 7 customers in total. Out of these, 5 didn't leave a tip. So, to find out how many customers did leave a tip, I can subtract the number of those who didn't tip from the total number of customers.

So, 7 total customers minus 5 who didn't tip equals 2 customers who did leave a tip. That makes sense because 5 didn't tip, so only 2 did.

Now, each of these 2 customers who did tip gave the waiter $3. To find out how much money they gave in total, I can multiply the number of tip-giving customers by the amount each tip was worth. So, 2 customers times $3 each equals $6 in total from tips.

But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about the non-tipping customers leaving anything. It only says that 5 didn't leave a tip. So, I assume that those 5 customers didn't give any money, meaning the waiter didn't earn anything from them.

Therefore, the only income the waiter earned was from the 2 customers who tipped. Adding that up, the total earnings would be $6.

Let me double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't miss anything. Total customers: 7. 5 didn't tip, so 2 did. Each tip was $3, so 2 times 3 is $6. Non-tippers didn't leave any money, so the waiter's total earnings are just the tips. Yep, that seems right.
</think>

The waiter earned a total of $6.

</think><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of chicken wings available. The chef has 9 chicken wings already cooked and an additional 7 wings that need to be cooked specifically for the group of 4 friends.

Next, I'll calculate the total number of chicken wings by adding the already cooked wings to the ones that need to be cooked. So, 9 plus 7 equals 16 chicken wings in total.

Since the group consists of 4 friends and each person is supposed to receive the same amount of chicken wings, I'll divide the total number of wings by the number of people. Dividing 16 by 4 gives 4 wings per person.

Therefore, each friend will receive 4 chicken wings.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's determine how many chicken wings each friend will receive.

1. **Total Chicken Wings Available:**
   - Already cooked: 9 wings
   - Additional wings to be cooked: 7 wings
   - **Total wings = 9 + 7 = 16 wings**

2. **Number of Friends:**
   - There are 4 friends in the group.

3. **Amount per Friend:**
   - To find out how many wings each friend gets, divide the total wings by the number of friends.
   - **Wings per friend = Total wings ÷ Number of friends = 16 ÷ 4 = 4 wings**

                 {Think step by step}
Okay, so I have this problem here about a builder who needs to install 9 windows. He's already installed 6 of them, and each window takes 6 hours to install. The question is, how long will it take him to install the rest? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand how many windows are left to install. The total required is 9, and he's already installed 6. So, the number of windows remaining should be 9 minus 6, which is 3. Got that part.

Now, each window takes 6 hours to install. So, if he has 3 windows left, I guess I need to calculate the total time required for those 3 windows and then figure out how long it'll take him. But wait, I should also consider if he can install them one after another or if he can work on them simultaneously. Hmm, the problem doesn't mention anything about multiple workers or parallel installation, so I think it's safe to assume he's doing it alone, one window at a time.

So, if he has 3 windows left, and each takes 6 hours, I can multiply the number of windows by the time per window. That would be 3 multiplied by 6, which is 18 hours. So, it'll take him 18 hours to install the remaining 3 windows.

Wait, let me double-check that. He has 6 windows already installed. 9 total minus 6 is 3. Each window is 6 hours. So, 3 times 6 is indeed 18 hours. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I'm missing anything here. The problem doesn't mention any breaks, multiple workers, or any other factors that could affect the time. So, the total time for the remaining windows is 18 hours.

I think that's all there is to it. So, the answer should be 18 hours.
</think>

To determine how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of windows remaining to be installed:**
   - Total windows needed: 9
   - Windows already installed: 6
   - Remaining windows = 9 - 6 = 3

2. **Determine the time required per window:**
   - Time per window = 6 hours

3. **Calculate the total time needed for the remaining windows:**
   - Total time = Number of remaining windows × Time per window
   - Total time = 3 × 6 = 18 hours

**Answer:** It will take the builder 18 hours to install the remaining windows.

Okay, so Frank went to the arcade and played two games: whack a mole and skee ball. He won 33 tickets from whack a mole and 9 tickets from skee ball. Now, he wants to buy candy that costs 6 tickets each. The question is, how many candies can he buy with his total tickets?

First, I need to figure out the total number of tickets Frank has. He won 33 from whack a mole and 9 from skee ball. So, I should add those together. Let me write that down: 33 + 9. Hmm, 33 plus 9 is 42. So, Frank has 42 tickets in total.

Now, each candy costs 6 tickets. To find out how many candies he can buy, I need to divide the total tickets by the cost per candy. So, that would be 42 divided by 6. Let me do that division: 42 ÷ 6. 6 goes into 42 seven times because 6 times 7 is 42. So, he can buy 7 candies.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 33 plus 9 is definitely 42, right? Yeah, because 30 plus 9 is 39, and then plus 3 more is 42. And 42 divided by 6 is 7 because 6 times 7 is 42. That seems correct.

I don't think I missed anything here. The problem is straightforward: add the tickets and then divide by the cost per candy. So, the answer should be 7 candies.

First, let me break down the problem. There are 13 people total. Out of these, 9 are kids, so that leaves 4 adults. Since kids eat free, their meals don't cost anything. But each adult meal costs $7. So, I only need to calculate the cost for the 4 adult meals.

Wait, is there any catch here? Like, sometimes problems mention taxes or tips, but this one doesn't say anything about that. So, I can safely assume it's just the cost of the meals without any extra charges.

So, let me write down the numbers. Number of adults = 4. Cost per adult meal = $7. Therefore, total cost for adults = 4 * 7.

Hmm, 4 times 7 is 28. So, the total cost would be $28.

Is there another way to think about this? Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The group has 13 people: 9 kids and 4 adults. Kids don't pay anything, so the only expense is for the 4 adults. Each adult pays $7, so 4 x 7 is indeed 28.

I think that's straightforward. No discounts or special offers are mentioned, so it's just a straightforward calculation. Therefore, the total cost is $28.
</think>

The group consists of 13 people: 9 kids who eat for free and 4 adults. Each adult meal costs $7. 

- Number of adults = 4
- Cost per adult meal = $7

Total cost for adults = 4 × $7 = $28.

{The final answer is $28}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",28

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Paige has **43 math problems** and **12 science problems** for homework.
- She finished **44 problems** at school.

**To Find:**
- The number of problems Paige had to do for homework.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of homework problems:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total homework problems} = \text{Math problems} + \text{Science problems} = 43 + 12 = 55
   \]

</think><think>
Rachel was playing a video game where she scores 9 points for each treasure she finds. She found 5 treasures on the first level and 2 on the second. To determine her total score, I need to calculate the points from each level separately and then sum them up.

First, on the first level, she found 5 treasures. Since each treasure is worth 9 points, I multiply 5 by 9 to find the total points from the first level: 5 × 9 = 45 points.

Next, on the second level, she found 2 treasures. Again, each treasure is worth 9 points, so I multiply 2 by 9 to find the total points from the second level: 2 × 9 = 18 points.

Finally, to find the total score, I add the points from both levels: 45 points (from the first level) + 18 points (from the second level) = 63 points.
</think>

**Solution:**

Rachel is playing a video game where she earns **9 points** for each treasure she finds. 

1. **First Level:**
   - She found **5 treasures**.
   - Points from the first level = Number of treasures × Points per treasure
   - Points = 5 × 9 = **45 points**

2. **Second Level:**
   - She found **2 treasures**.
   - Points from the second level = Number of treasures × Points per treasure
   - Points = 2 × 9 = **18 points**

3. **Total Score:**
   - Total points = Points from first level + Points from second level
   - Total points = 45 + 18 = **63 points**

**Final Answer:**

                    question:

                 {Think step by step}

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a waiter at a restaurant named ""The Greasy Spoon."" Let me try to understand what's going on. 

The problem says the waiter had 26 customers to wait on during lunch. Then, during the rush, he added another 27 customers. So, initially, it's 26, and then he gets 27 more, making the total number of customers... hmm, 26 plus 27. Let me add those up. 26 plus 27 is 53. So, in total, there are 53 customers. 

Now, the next part says that 27 of these customers didn't leave him a tip. Hmm, so out of the total 53, 27 didn't tip. The question is asking how many customers did leave a tip. 

Wait, so if 27 didn't tip, then the number who did tip would be the total minus those who didn't tip. So, 53 total minus 27 who didn't tip equals... let me do that subtraction. 53 minus 27. Hmm, 27 from 53. 27 goes into 53 once with 26 left over, so 1 times 27 is 27, subtract that from 53, and you get 26. So, 26 customers did leave a tip.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the problem starts by saying he had 26 customers to wait on, then added another 27 during the rush. So, total customers is 26 + 27 = 53. Then, 27 didn't leave a tip. So, the ones who did tip would be 53 - 27 = 26. That seems straightforward. 

Is there any other way to interpret this? Maybe the initial 26 were already waiting, and then 27 came in during the rush. So, the 27 during the rush didn't leave a tip, and the original 26, did they all tip? Or could some of them have not tipped as well? The problem says ""27 of the customers didn't leave him a tip,"" so it's 27 out of the total 53, not just the 27 added during the rush. So, the original 26 could have some who didn't tip, but the problem doesn't specify how many. 

Wait, actually, the problem doesn't say that the original 26 all tipped or not. It just says that 27 of the total 53 didn't tip. So, the 27 could include some from the initial 26 and some from the 27 added during the rush. So, the number of customers who did tip would be 53 minus 27, which is 26, regardless of how the 27 are distributed between the initial and added customers. 

So, in any case, the total number of customers who tipped is 26. I don't think there's any more to it. The problem doesn't give any more details, so I think that's the answer.
</think>

To determine how many customers left a tip, first calculate the total number of customers. The waiter initially had 26 customers and then added 27 more during the rush, making the total 53. Since 27 didn't leave a tip, subtract this number from the total to find out how many did leave a tip.

53 total customers - 27 who didn't tip = 26 who did tip.

                    question:
                     A toy ; store had 17 giant stuffed bears in stock ? when they got another shipment with 10 bears in it. The put the bears onto shelves . with 9 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? 
                 Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many shelves the toy store used. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says the toy store had 17 giant stuffed bears in stock. Then they got another shipment with 10 more bears. So, I should probably start by finding out the total number of bears they have after the shipment arrives. That makes sense because the shelves are going to be used to store all these bears.

Alright, so 17 plus 10 is... let me do the math. 17 + 10 equals 27. So, they have a total of 27 bears now. Got that.

Next, the problem mentions that the bears are put onto shelves with 9 on each shelf. So, I need to figure out how many shelves are required to store all 27 bears if each shelf can hold 9 bears. Hmm, how do I do that?

I remember that when you have a certain number of items and you want to know how many containers you need, you can use division. If I divide the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf, the result should tell me how many shelves are needed. But wait, division can sometimes give me a decimal, which doesn't make sense here because you can't have a fraction of a shelf. So, I think I need to round up to the nearest whole number in that case.

Let me write that down: number of shelves = total bears / bears per shelf. Plugging in the numbers, that's 27 divided by 9. Let me do the division. 27 ÷ 9 is 3. So, that gives me exactly 3 shelves. 

But hold on, what if the division didn't come out evenly? For example, if there were 28 bears instead of 27, 28 ÷ 9 is about 3.111... So, in that case, you'd need 4 shelves because you can't have a third of a shelf. But in our problem, since 27 is perfectly divisible by 9, we don't have that issue. So, 3 shelves are enough.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 17 plus 10 is definitely 27, right? Yeah, 17 plus 10 is 27. And 27 divided by 9 is 3. That seems right. So, the shelves required are 3.

Is there another way to think about this problem to confirm my answer? Maybe by distributing the bears into shelves one by one. Let's see:

First shelf: 9 bears
Second shelf: 9 bears
Third shelf: 9 bears

That's 9 + 9 + 9, which is 27. Perfect, that matches the total number of bears. So, 3 shelves are indeed needed.

Alternatively, I can visualize it. If I imagine 9 bears on each shelf, the first shelf is full, the second shelf is full, and the third shelf is full. There's no bear left over, so 3 shelves are sufficient.

I think I'm confident with this answer. No mistakes noticed here.
</think>

The toy store had 17 bears and received 10 more, making a total of 27 bears. Each shelf holds 9 bears. Dividing the total number of bears by the number per shelf gives 27 ÷ 9 = 3. Therefore, 3 shelves are needed.

                 Wendy uploaded 79 pictures. She put 44 into one album and the rest into 5 different albums. We need to find how many pictures are in each of those 5 different albums. 

First, let's find out how many pictures were put into the 5 different albums. She has 79 total pictures. She already put 44 into one album. So, 79 minus 44 equals 35 pictures left. These 35 pictures are distributed equally into the 5 different albums. 

To find out how many pictures are in each of these 5 albums, we can divide 35 by 5. 

35 divided by 5 is 7.

                <think>
First, determine the number of members who attended the game. Since there were originally 11 members and 6 didn't show up, the number of attendees is 11 minus 6, which equals 5.

Each of these 5 members scored 9 points. To find the total points scored, multiply the number of attendees by the points each member earned. So, 5 attendees multiplied by 9 points each equals 45 points.

Therefore, the total points scored by the team is 45.

                    question:
                     A pet store had 13 siamese cats and : 5 house cats. During a sale they ! sold 10 cats. How many cats do they have left? 
                 Okay, so I have this problem about a pet store. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the store has two types of cats: siamese and house cats. Initially, there are 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats. Then, during a sale, they sold 10 cats. I need to find out how many cats are left.

Alright, let me break it down. The total number of cats initially is the sum of siamese and house cats. So, 13 plus 5. Let me calculate that: 13 + 5 equals 18. So, they started with 18 cats.

Now, the store sold 10 cats. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify whether the sale was only for siamese cats, house cats, or a mix. That could be important. Wait, the way it's worded is just ""sold 10 cats,"" so I think it's a mix of both types. So, they sold some siamese and some house cats.

But hold on, do I need to know exactly how many of each were sold? Or can I just subtract the total sold from the initial total? Because the problem doesn't specify, maybe I can just assume that all 10 sold were from either group. Wait, but in reality, the store would have sold a combination, but without knowing how many of each, I can't be precise.

Wait, maybe the problem is intended to be straightforward. It says ""they sold 10 cats,"" so perhaps the total number sold is 10 regardless of type. So, the remaining cats would be 18 minus 10, which is 8. But that seems too simple, and the problem mentions two types, so maybe I need to consider both.

Wait, another approach: maybe the store sold all 10 cats from one type, so we have to subtract from each accordingly. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the intended answer is simply 18 - 10 = 8. However, that might be incorrect because the problem mentions two types, implying that the number remaining would be a combination.

Alternatively, maybe the store sold 10 cats, but it's unclear whether they were all siamese, all house, or a mix. So, perhaps the problem expects me to realize that without knowing how many of each were sold, I can't determine the exact number left. But that seems unlikely because the problem is presented as solvable.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem states the store had 13 siamese and 5 house cats. It sold 10 cats. So, the total number of cats now is 13 + 5 - 10 = 8. So, 8 cats left. But that ignores the types, but the problem doesn't specify how many of each were sold. So, perhaps the answer is 8, assuming that the 10 sold were a mix, but without knowing the exact numbers, maybe the problem expects just the total subtraction.

Wait, let me check the problem again: ""A pet store had 13 siamese cats and : 5 house cats. During a sale they ! sold 10 cats. How many cats do they have left?"" The colon after 5 might be a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be ""and 5 house cats."" So, the store had 13 siamese and 5 house, total 18. Sold 10, so 18 - 10 = 8. So, the answer is 8.

But wait, the problem mentions two types, so maybe it's implying that the store sold all 10 from one type, but since it doesn't specify, perhaps the answer is 8 regardless. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the store sold 10 cats, but couldn't sell more than each type had. Wait, 13 siamese and 5 house. If they sold 10, perhaps they sold all 5 house cats and 5 siamese, leaving 8 siamese. But that's assuming they sold as many as possible from each type.

But without knowing, the problem might just be expecting the total subtraction. So, 18 - 10 = 8. Therefore, the answer is 8.

Wait, but the problem mentions two types, so maybe it's intended that after selling 10, the store has some of each type left. So, perhaps the store sold 5 siamese and 5 house cats, leaving 8 siamese and 0 house cats. Or maybe sold 10 of one type, say 10 siamese, leaving 3 siamese and 5 house. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the answer is simply 8, regardless of type.

I think the intended answer is 8, so I",8

Hmm, first, I should probably calculate how much he earned each day and then add them together. That makes sense because earnings are accumulated over time.

Starting with Monday. He worked 5 hours at $6 per hour. So, I can multiply the number of hours by his hourly rate to get his daily earnings. Let me write that down: 5 hours * $6/hour = $30. Okay, so he made $30 on Monday.

Now, moving on to Tuesday. He worked the same number of hours, which is 5 hours, at the same hourly rate of $6. So, using the same calculation: 5 hours * $6/hour = $30. That means he also made $30 on Tuesday.

To find the total earnings for the two days, I need to add the money he made each day. So, $30 from Monday plus $30 from Tuesday equals $60 in total.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 5 hours times $6 is indeed $30, and adding that twice gives $60. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think there are any other factors mentioned in the problem, like taxes or deductions, so I don't need to consider those. It's straightforward hourly wage for the hours worked each day.

So, Victor made $60 in total over the two days.
</think>

To determine how much money Victor earned over the two days, we can calculate his earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Victor's earnings on Monday:**
   - Victor worked for 5 hours at an hourly rate of $6.
   - Earnings = (Number of hours worked) × (Hourly rate)
   - Earnings = 5 hours × $6/hour = $30

2. **Calculate Victor's earnings on Tuesday:**
   - Victor also worked for 5 hours at an hourly rate of $6.
   - Earnings = (Number of hours worked) × (Hourly rate)
   - Earnings = 5 hours × $6/hour = $30

3. **Sum the earnings from both days:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings on Monday + Earnings on Tuesday
   - Total earnings = $30 + $30 = $60

**Final Answer:**
Victor made a total of $\boxed{60}$ dollars over the two days.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",60
" Megan ; baked 71 cupcakes ! for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 43 of them how many packages , could she make if she put 7 cupcake in each package? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Megan ; baked 71 cupcakes ! for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 43 of them how many packages , could she make if she put 7 cupcake in each package? 
                 Megan baked 71 cupcakes. Her brother Todd ate 43 of them. So, how many cupcakes did Megan have left after Todd ate some? Let me subtract the 43 from 71. 71 minus 43 is 28. So Megan has 28 cupcakes left.

Now, she wants to put these into packages with 7 cupcakes each. How many packages can she make from 28 cupcakes? I need to divide 28 by 7. 28 divided by 7 is 4. So she can make 4 packages.

Wait, let me double-check. 4 packages with 7 cupcakes each is 4 times 7, which is 28. Yes, that matches the number of cupcakes she has left. So the answer is 4.
</think>

Megan baked a total of 71 cupcakes. Her brother Todd ate 43 of them. To find out how many cupcakes are left, subtract the number Todd ate from the total:

71 cupcakes (baked) - 43 cupcakes (eaten by Todd) = 28 cupcakes left.

Next, to determine how many packages Megan can make if she puts 7 cupcakes in each package, divide the number of remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per package:

28 cupcakes ÷ 7 cupcakes/package = 4 packages.

Therefore, Megan can make \(\boxed{4}\) packages.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",4

                    question:
                     There were 2 friends playing a ? video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 6 lives, how ! many lives did they have total? ; 
                

</think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where two friends are playing an online video game. Then, two more players join them. Each player has 6 lives. The question is asking how many lives they had in total.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. We have two friends already playing the game, and then two more players join. So, in total, there are four players now. Each of these players has 6 lives. So, to find the total number of lives, I need to figure out how many lives each player has and then add them all together.

Let me break it down. Initially, there are two friends. Each has 6 lives. So, for the first two players, the total lives would be 6 (for the first friend) plus 6 (for the second friend). That adds up to 12 lives.

Now, two more players join. So, that makes the total number of players four. Each of these new players also has 6 lives. So, for each new player, it's 6 lives. Since there are two new players, that's 6 times 2, which is 12 lives.

Now, to find the total lives altogether, I need to add up the lives of all four players. The initial two had 12 lives together, and the new two added another 12 lives. So, 12 plus 12 equals 24.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says each player had 6 lives. So, each of the four players has 6 lives. That means 4 players times 6 lives each. 4 times 6 is 24. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think there's any trick or hidden detail here. It's straightforward. The initial two plus the two new players make four players, each with 6 lives. So, the total lives are 4 multiplied by 6, which is 24.

Just to double-check, if I list out each player's lives: Friend 1 has 6, Friend 2 has 6, Player 3 has 6, Player 4 has 6. Adding them all together: 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24. Yep, that confirms it.

So, the total number of lives they have is 24.
</think>

There were initially 2 friends, and 2 more players joined, making a total of 4 players. Each player had 6 lives. To find the total number of lives:

- Number of players = 4
- Lives per player = 6

Total lives = 4 players × 6 lives/player = 24 lives.

{The final answer is} 24 lives.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",24

</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Sam had 10 socks. If he threw away **3** old ones that didn't fit and bought **36** new ones, how many socks would he have?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Initial Count of Socks:**
   - Sam initially has **10** socks.

2. **Socks Thrown Away:**
   - Sam throws away **3** old socks.
   - After throwing away, the number of socks left with Sam is:
     \[
     10 \text{ (initial)} - 3 \text{ (thrown away)} = 7 \text{ socks}
     \]

3. **New Socks Purchased:**
   - Sam buys **36** new socks.
   - Adding the new socks to the remaining socks:
     \[

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of flowers Wendy has, which is 103.

She is making bouquets with 8 flowers each. To find out how many bouquets she can make initially, I divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet.

Next, out of the 103 flowers, 47 wilted. This means the number of usable flowers is the total minus the wilted ones.

Finally, I divide the usable flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet to find out how many bouquets Wendy can still make.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Total number of flowers Wendy has:**  
   \(103\) flowers.

2. **Number of flowers per bouquet:**  
   \(8\) flowers per bouquet.

3. **Number of flowers that wilted:**  
   \(47\) flowers.

4. **Calculate the number of usable flowers:**  
   \[
   \text{Usable flowers} = \text{Total flowers} - \text{Wilted flowers} = 103 - 47 = 56
   \]

5. **Determine how many bouquets can be made with the usable flowers:**  
   \[
   \text{Number of bouquets} = \frac{\text{Usable flowers}}{\text{Flowers per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7
   \]

";  Adam , had 48 books. If he sold 19 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Adam have? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    ;  Adam , had 48 books. If he sold 19 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Adam have? 
                 

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Adam and his books. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, Adam starts with 48 books. Then he sells 19 of them. Selling books would mean he gets money, right? So he makes some money from selling 19 books. Then he uses that money to buy 38 new books. The question is asking how many books Adam would have after all this.

Alright, let's break it down. First, he has 48 books. He sells 19. So, he loses those 19 books, but gains some money. Then he uses that money to buy 38 new ones. So, the number of books he has after selling and buying is his original 48 minus the 19 he sold, plus the 38 he bought with the money.

Wait, let me make sure. When he sells 19 books, he's decreasing his total by 19. Then, he uses the money from those sales to buy 38 new ones. So, he's increasing his total by 38. So, the net change is minus 19 plus 38.

Let me write that out numerically. He starts with 48. He sells 19, so subtract 19: 48 - 19 = 29. Then he buys 38, so add 38: 29 + 38 = 67. So, he ends up with 67 books.

Wait, is there another way to think about it? Maybe using money. Let's say he sells each book for $1, just to make the math simple. Then he would get $19 from selling 19 books. With that $19, he buys 38 books. Hmm, that doesn't quite add up because $19 divided by 38 books would be about 0.5 dollars per book, which is a bit odd. Maybe the price per book isn't important here because the problem doesn't specify it. It's just about the number of books.

So, I think my initial way is correct. He starts with 48, sells 19, so he has 29 left. Then he buys 38, so he ends up with 29 + 38 = 67. That makes sense.

Another way to look at it: the total number of books he has is the books he had after selling plus the new ones he bought. So, he had 48, sold 19, so he had 48 - 19 = 29. Then he bought 38, so 29 + 38 = 67.

Wait, maybe I should consider it differently. If he sold 19 and bought 38, is there a possibility that the money from selling 19 is used to buy 38, which might mean he's exchanging old books for new ones, but the problem says he used the money to buy new books, so he's not exchanging, he's just using the money to buy more books. So, he's selling some to get money, then using that money to buy more, so the total number is 48 -19 +38 = 67.

Yes, that's consistent. So, I think 67 is the correct answer.

Let me double-check the arithmetic: 48 minus 19 is 29, and 29 plus 38 is 67. Yep, that's correct.

So, the key steps are:

1. Adam starts with 48 books.
2. He sells 19, so subtract 19: 48 -19 =29.
3. He uses the money from the sale to buy 38 new books, so add 38: 29 +38=67.

Therefore, Adam ends up with 67 books.
</think>

Adam starts with 48 books. He sells 19, leaving him with 29. He then buys 38 new books, so the total is 29 + 38 = 67.

                    question:
                     Nancy's class is going on a field trip to , the zoo. If each van : can hold 5 people and there ? are 12 students and 3 adults going, how many vans will they need? 
                 Okay, so Nancy's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. Hmm, let me try to figure out how many vans they'll need. First, I need to know how many people are going. The problem says there are 12 students and 3 adults. So, adding those together, that makes 15 people in total.

Wait, the problem mentions that each van can hold 5 people. So, if each van holds 5, I guess I need to see how many groups of 5 can be formed from the 15 people. Let me think, 15 divided by 5 is 3. So, that would mean they need 3 vans. But wait, am I missing something?

Oh, wait, the problem says there are 12 students and 3 adults. So, does each van require specific numbers of adults or can it be a mix? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify that adults and students have to be in separate vans. So, I think each van can carry any combination of students and adults, as long as the total doesn't exceed 5.

So, let me recalculate. If we have 15 people total, and each van can take up to 5, then the number of vans needed is the total number of people divided by the capacity of each van. So, 15 divided by 5 is 3. So, 3 vans.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe they need more than 3 because of some other constraints. For example, maybe each van requires a certain number of adults, like a driver or something. But the problem doesn't specify that. It just says each van can hold 5 people. So, I don't think that's the case.

Another thought: are the adults and students treated differently? Like, maybe each van needs to have at least one adult. But again, the problem doesn't specify that. It just says 12 students and 3 adults going. So, I don't think that's necessary.

Therefore, the total number of people is 15, each van can take 5, so 15 divided by 5 is 3. So, 3 vans. That seems straightforward.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is simple: 12 students + 3 adults = 15 people. Each van holds 5. So, 15 / 5 = 3. So, 3 vans needed.

Yeah, I think that's correct. There's no mention of any additional constraints, so I don't see why it would require more than 3.
</think>

Nancy's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. There are 12 students and 3 adults attending. Each van can hold up to 5 people. To determine the number of vans needed, we calculate the total number of people and divide by the capacity of each van.

Total people = 12 students + 3 adults = 15 people.

Number of vans needed = Total people / Capacity per van = 15 / 5 = 3.

Thus, they will need 3 vans.

                 {Think:}
Okay, so Tom is having a birthday party and he's buying sodas. He bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. Now, the fridge can only hold 7 sodas on each shelf. The question is asking how many shelves he would fill up. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to figure out the total number of sodas Tom has. He bought 4 regular and 52 diet. So, adding those together, 4 + 52 equals... let me do the math... 4 + 50 is 54, and then +2 is 56. So, he has 56 sodas in total.

Now, the fridge can hold 7 sodas per shelf. So, to find out how many shelves he needs, I guess I need to divide the total number of sodas by the number each shelf can hold. That would be 56 divided by 7. Let me calculate that: 56 ÷ 7 is 8. So, he would need 8 shelves.

Wait, but hold on a second. The problem mentions regular and diet sodas. Does that matter? Like, can he mix them on the same shelf or does he have to separate them? The problem doesn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume he can mix them. So, whether they're regular or diet, each soda takes up one spot on the shelf. Therefore, the total number of sodas, regardless of type, is 56, and each shelf holds 7. So, 56 divided by 7 is indeed 8 shelves.

Is there another way to look at it? Maybe by calculating how many of each soda he has and then figuring out how to distribute them? But since the fridge can hold any type, I don't think it's necessary. The problem doesn't give any constraints on the types, so I think the initial approach is correct.

Just to double-check, 8 shelves with 7 each would hold 56, which matches the total number of sodas. So, yeah, 8 shelves is the answer.
</think>

Tom has a total of 56 sodas (4 regular + 52 diet). Since each shelf can hold 7 sodas, he needs 8 shelves.

First, I need to determine how many trays Luke can carry in a single trip. He can carry 4 trays at a time.

Next, I'll calculate the number of trips required to pick up 20 trays from the first table. Since he can carry 4 trays per trip, the number of trips is 20 divided by 4, which equals 5 trips.

Then, I'll calculate the number of trips needed for the second table with 16 trays. Again, dividing 16 by 4 gives 4 trips.

Finally, I'll add the number of trips from both tables together. Adding 5 trips and 4 trips results in a total of 9 trips.
</think>

**Solution:**

Luke can carry **4 trays** at a time. We need to determine the number of trips he will make to pick up **20 trays** from one table and **16 trays** from another.

1. **Calculate trips for the first table:**
   - Total trays to pick up: 20
   - Trays carried per trip: 4
   - Number of trips = Total trays ÷ Trays per trip
   - Number of trips = 20 ÷ 4 = **5 trips**

2. **Calculate trips for the second table:**
   - Total trays to pick up: 16
   - Trays carried per trip: 4
   - Number of trips = Total trays ÷ Trays per trip
   - Number of trips = 16 ÷ 4 = **4 trips**

3. **Calculate total trips:**
   - Total trips = Trips for first table + Trips for second table
   - Total trips = 5 + 4 = **9 trips**

</think><think>
To determine how much money Henry needs to complete his collection of 8 action figures, I'll follow these steps.

First, I'll calculate the total cost for one action figure, which is $6.

Since Henry already has 3 action figures, I'll identify the number of additional figures he needs by subtracting the ones he already has from the total required, which is 8 - 3 = 5.

Finally, I'll calculate the total cost for the remaining 5 action figures by multiplying the cost per figure by the number of additional figures needed: 5 * $6 = $30.

Therefore, Henry would need $30 to complete his collection.
</think>

**Solution:**

Henry wants to complete his action figure collection, which requires a total of **8** figures. He currently has **3** figures. Let's determine how much money he needs to buy the remaining figures.

1. **Identify the number of additional figures needed:**
   
   \[
   \text{Additional figures needed} = \text{Total required} - \text{Current number of figures} = 8 - 3 = 5
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for the additional figures:**
   
   Each action figure costs **\$6**. Therefore, the cost for **5** figures is:
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of additional figures} \times \text{Cost per figure} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ dollars}

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Frank had saved up \$3. If he received another \$37 for his allowance, how many \$8 toys could he buy?

**Step 1: Determine the Total Amount Frank Has After Receiving the Allowance**

Frank initially has \$3. He receives an additional \$37.
\[
\text{Total Amount} = \$3 + \$37 = \$40
\]

**Step 2: Calculate How Many \$8 Toys Frank Can Buy with \$40**

To find out how many toys Frank can purchase, divide the total amount by the cost of one toy.
\[
\text{Number of Toys} = \frac{\$40}{\$8} = 5
\]

**Conclusion:**
Frank can buy 5 toys with his total allowance.

                <think>
First, I need to determine the total number of carrots picked by Vanessa and her mom. Vanessa picked 17 carrots, and her mother picked 14, so together they picked 17 + 14 = 31 carrots.

Next, it's stated that only 24 of the carrots were good. To find out how many bad carrots there are, I subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked.

So, the number of bad carrots is 31 total carrots minus 24 good carrots, which equals 7 bad carrots.

Therefore, Vanessa and her mom have 7 bad carrots.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bad carrots Vanessa and her mom have.

1. **Total Carrots Picked:**
   - Vanessa picked **17** carrots.
   - Her mom picked **14** carrots.
   
   **Total carrots picked = 17 + 14 = 31** carrots.

2. **Good Carrots:**
   - It is given that **24** carrots are good.

3. **Calculating Bad Carrots:**
   - To find the number of bad carrots, subtract the number of good carrots from the total carrots picked.
   
   **Bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Good carrots**
   
   **Bad carrots = 31 - 24 = 7**

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
To determine how many people will be on each team when 23 managers and 7 employees split into 6 teams, I first calculate the total number of participants.

23 managers plus 7 employees equals 30 people in total.

Since there are 6 teams, I divide the total number of participants by 6 to find out how many people will be on each team.

30 divided by 6 equals 5.

Therefore, each team will have 5 people.
</think>

**Solution:**

We need to determine how many people will be on each team when **23 managers** and **7 employees** split into **6 teams**.

1. **Calculate the total number of participants:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total participants} = \text{Managers} + \text{Employees} = 23 + 7 = 30
   \]

2. **Determine the number of people per team:**
   
   \[
   \text{People per team} = \frac{\text{Total participants}}{\text{Number of teams}} = \frac{30}{6} = 5

                     Tiffany baked 8 brownies, but needed 17 total for her party. : If she used 8 cups , of flour . on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need? 
                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
First, I need to determine how much flour Tiffany used for the 8 brownies she baked. Each brownie requires 8 cups of flour, so the total flour used is 8 cups multiplied by 8 brownies, which equals 64 cups.

Next, I calculate the total flour needed for the party. Tiffany requires 17 brownies in total, and each brownie needs 8 cups of flour. Therefore, the total flour needed is 17 multiplied by 8 cups, resulting in 136 cups.

Finally, to find out how much more flour Tiffany needs, I subtract the flour she already used from the total needed. So, 136 cups minus 64 cups equals 72 cups.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total flour used for the 8 brownies:**
   
   \[
   \text{Flour used} = \text{Flour per brownie} \times \text{Number of brownies} = 8 \, \text{cups} \times 8 = 64 \, \text{cups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total flour needed for 17 brownies:**
   
   \[
   \text{Flour needed} = \text{Flour per brownie} \times \text{Number of brownies} = 8 \, \text{cups} \times 17 = 136 \, \text{cups}
   \]

3. **Find out how much more flour is needed:**
   
   \[
   \text{Flour still needed} = \text{Total flour needed} - \text{Flour used} = 136 \, \text{cups} - 64 \, \text{cups} = 72 \, \text{cups}

                 Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. So, Carol and her mom are picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked 29 carrots, and her mom picked 16. In total, that's 29 plus 16, which is 45 carrots picked. Now, it says that only 38 of these carrots were good. The question is asking how many bad carrots they had.

Hmm, so if there are 38 good carrots out of 45 picked, then the bad ones would be the total minus the good ones. That seems straightforward. So, 45 minus 38 equals... let me calculate that. 45 minus 38 is 7. So, does that mean there were 7 bad carrots?

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem mentions Carol and her mom, so it's two people picking carrots. Carol picked 29, mom picked 16. So, 29 plus 16 is 45. Then, only 38 were good. So, the bad ones are the remaining. So yes, 45 minus 38 is 7. So, 7 bad carrots.

I don't think there's anything more complicated here. It's just a simple subtraction problem after adding their picks together. So, I think the answer is 7.
</think>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Carrots Picked**: Carol picked 29 carrots, and her mom picked 16. So, the total number of carrots picked is:
   
   \[
   29 + 16 = 45
   \]

2. **Good Carrots**: It is given that only 38 of these carrots were good.

3. **Bad Carrots**: To find the number of bad carrots, subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked.

   \[
   45 - 38 = 7
   \]

Therefore, Carol and her mom had **7** bad carrots.

</think>
Alright, so Bianca got 78 pieces of candy for Halloween. She ate 30 pieces first. Hmm, okay, so how many candies does she have left after eating? Let me subtract 30 from 78. 78 minus 30 is 48. So she has 48 candies left.

Now, she wants to put the remaining candies into piles, with each pile having 8 candies. The question is, how many piles can she make? So I think I need to divide the number of candies she has left by the number of candies per pile.

Let me do that calculation. 48 divided by 8. Hmm, 8 goes into 48 six times because 8 times 6 is 48. So that means she can make 6 piles.

Wait, let me double-check that. If she makes 6 piles with 8 candies each, that's 6 times 8, which is 48. Yep, that matches the number of candies she has left after eating. So 6 is the correct number of piles.
</think>

Bianca started with 78 candies, ate 30, leaving her with 48 candies. She can create piles of 8 candies each. Dividing 48 by 8 gives 6 piles.

</think>
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Wendy is playing a video game and she has 10 lives. Then she gets into a hard part of the game and loses 6 lives. After that, she gets 37 more lives in the next level. The question is, how many lives does she have in total now?

First, I need to understand the initial number of lives Wendy has. It says she started with 10 lives. That seems straightforward. So, she begins with 10.

Then, she loses 6 lives in a hard part of the game. Hmm, losing lives means her total decreases. So, I should subtract those 6 lives from her initial 10. Let me do that calculation: 10 minus 6 equals 4. So, after losing 6 lives, she has 4 left.

Now, she gets 37 more lives in the next level. So, after losing some, she gains more. That should increase her total. So, I need to add those 37 lives to her current number, which is 4. Let me add that: 4 plus 37 equals 41. So, adding 37 to her 4 remaining lives gives her a total of 41.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 10, subtract 6 gives 4. Then adding 37: 4 + 37 is definitely 41. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think there's any other information or steps involved here. It's a straightforward subtraction and addition problem. So, I think 41 is the correct number of lives Wendy has now.

                    question:
                     There school's baseball team had 48 new players ; and ! 6 returning players. If the coach put ! them into groups with 6 players in each group, how many groups would there be? 
                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
First, I identify the total number of players, which is 48 new players plus 6 returning players, totaling 54 players.

Next, I consider the number of players per group, which is 6. To find out how many groups there are, I divide the total number of players by the number of players per group.

Finally, dividing 54 by 6 gives me the total number of groups, which is 9.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Number of new players = 48
- Number of returning players = 6

**Total number of players =**  
48 (new) + 6 (returning) = **54 players**

**Players per group =**  
6 players per group

**Number of groups =**  
To find the number of groups, divide the total number of players by the number of players per group.

\[
\text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total players}}{\text{Players per group}} = \frac{54}{6} = 9
\]

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{9}

                 Okay, let's see. So Luke has some old games he's selling. He started with 39 games. Then he sold 19 of them. So, how many does he have left?

Hmm, 39 minus 19. Let me do that subtraction. 39 minus 10 is 29, and then minus 9 more is 20. So he has 20 games left.

Now, he packed the rest up, putting 4 games into each box. I need to figure out how many boxes he used. So, how many times does 4 go into 20?

Well, 4 times 5 is 20. So, he would need 5 boxes.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. He started with 39, sold 19, so 20 left. Each box holds 4. 20 divided by 4 is 5. Yep, that seems right.

So, he used 5 boxes.
</think>

Luke started with 39 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games he has left, subtract the number he sold from the total he had:

39 - 19 = 20 games remaining.

Next, he packed the remaining 20 games into boxes, with each box containing 4 games. To determine how many boxes he needed, divide the total number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold:

20 ÷ 4 = 5 boxes.

Therefore, Luke used 5 boxes.

                    question:
                     There are 65 ! students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 17 of them didn't get picked ! for the team and the rest ? were put into 8 groups, how many students would be in each group? 
                 {The final answer is}
</think>

Alright, so I've got this problem here about 65 factorial students trying out for the school's trivia teams. Hmm, that seems like a huge number! Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that 17 of them didn't get picked for the team. So, if there are 65! students in total and 17 didn't get picked, how many were actually picked? I think I can subtract the 17 who weren't picked from the total number of students. So, that would be 65! minus 17. Let me write that down:

Number of students picked = 65! - 17

Okay, now it says the rest were put into 8 groups. So, the rest refers to the students who were picked, right? Because the 17 didn't get picked. So, the rest would be 65! minus 17, which is the number of students picked. So, these picked students are divided into 8 groups.

To find out how many students are in each group, I need to divide the total number of picked students by the number of groups. That makes sense because if you have a certain number of students and you want to split them equally into groups, you divide by the number of groups.

So, number of students per group = (65! - 17) / 8

Wait a minute, that seems a bit complicated. Let me think about whether I'm missing something. The problem mentions 65! which is a factorial, meaning 65 multiplied by every whole number below it down to 1. That's a massive number! So, 65! is a huge number, and subtracting 17 from it would still leave us with an enormous number.

But when we divide that by 8, we're looking for how many students are in each group. Since 65! is divisible by all numbers up to 65, subtracting 17 might complicate things. Is there a way to simplify this?

Hold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem doesn't specify that the groups have to be whole numbers or anything, so perhaps it's acceptable to leave the answer in terms of 65! divided by 8 minus 17 divided by 8. But that would involve fractions, which might not make sense in the context of the problem.

Wait, no, the number of students per group has to be a whole number because you can't have a fraction of a student. So, maybe 65! - 17 must be divisible by 8. But 65! is divisible by 8 because 8 is less than 65, so 65! includes 8 as a factor. Therefore, 65! is divisible by 8, so 65! divided by 8 is a whole number. But when we subtract 17, which isn't divisible by 8, the result might not be a whole number anymore.

Hmm, that's a problem. If 65! - 17 isn't divisible by 8, then the number of students per group wouldn't be a whole number, which doesn't make sense. So, maybe the problem assumes that 65! - 17 is divisible by 8, or perhaps it's a trick question.

Wait, let me go back to the problem statement: ""There are 65! students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 17 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 8 groups, how many students would be in each group?""

So, it's saying the rest were put into 8 groups, implying that 65! - 17 is divisible by 8. Maybe in the context of the problem, they expect us to assume that 65! - 17 is divisible by 8, so we can just proceed with the division.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that 65! is a factorial, so 65! is divisible by all integers up to 65, which includes 8. So, 65! divided by 8 is an integer, but when we subtract 17, which is not a multiple of 8, we might have a remainder. So, perhaps the problem is expecting an expression rather than a numerical value.

But I think the problem is expecting a numerical answer, so maybe it's assuming that 65! - 17 is divisible by 8, so the number of students per group is (65! - 17)/8.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Maybe I'm supposed to recognize that 65! is a multiple of 8, so 65! divided by 8 is an integer, but when we subtract 17, which is not a multiple of 8, the result is not an integer. So,",6

</think><think>
I need to determine the total number of pictures Isabel uploaded to Facebook.

She uploaded a total of 25 pictures. She placed 10 pictures into one album.

This leaves 25 minus 10, which equals 15 pictures remaining.

These 15 pictures are distributed into 5 different albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, I divide the remaining 15 pictures by 5 albums.

15 divided by 5 equals 3.

Therefore, each of the 5 albums contains 3 pictures.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's determine the number of pictures in each album step by step.

1. **Total Pictures Uploaded:**
   \[
   \text{Total pictures} = 25
   \]

2. **Pictures in the First Album:**
   \[
   \text{Pictures in first album} = 10
   \]

3. **Remaining Pictures After the First Album:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining pictures} = 25 - 10 = 15
   \]

4. **Pictures Distributed into the Remaining Albums:**
   \[
   \text{Total remaining albums} = 5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pictures per remaining album} = \frac{15}{5} = 3
   \]

**Answer:** Each of the 5 different albums contains \(\boxed{3}\) pictures.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",3

                    question:
                     Mike made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 26 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 5 dollar a week, how long would the money ! last . him? 
                 Okay, so Mike made some money from mowing lawns and weed eating. He made $14 from mowing and $26 from weed eating. Hmm, wait, that seems like a lot. Let me see, does that add up? So, $14 plus $26 would be... 14 plus 20 is 34, and then plus 6 is 40. So he made a total of $40? That's impressive for a week's work, I guess.

Now, the question is about how long his money will last if he only spends $5 a week. So, he has $40, and he's spending $5 each week. I think to find out how long the money will last, we need to divide the total amount he has by the weekly expenditure. So, $40 divided by $5. Let me do that math: 40 divided by 5 is 8. So, does that mean his money will last him 8 weeks?

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says he made $14 mowing lawns and $26 weed eating. So, is that per week? Or is that total? The wording isn't entirely clear. Hmm. It says ""Mike made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 26 dollars weed eating."" It doesn't specify the time period, but since the next part is about weekly spending, I think it's safe to assume that the $14 and $26 are his earnings for the week. So, in total, he has $40 for the week.

He spends $5 each week, so as I calculated before, 40 divided by 5 is 8. So, his money will last him 8 weeks. That seems straightforward.

Is there another way to look at this? Maybe considering daily expenses or something, but the problem doesn't mention anything about daily spending. It only mentions he spent $5 a week. So, I think the initial approach is correct.

Let me just double-check my division. 5 times 8 is 40, which matches the total money Mike has. So, yes, 8 weeks is the correct answer.
</think>

Mike earned a total of $40 from mowing lawns and weed eating. If he spends $5 each week, the amount of time his money will last is calculated by dividing the total earnings by the weekly expenditure:  
40 ÷ 5 = 8 weeks.

First, I need to determine the total number of shirts Dave has. There are two types of shirts: short sleeves and long sleeves.

There are 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts. Adding these together gives a total of 36 shirts.

Next, I see that Dave washed 20 shirts before school started. This includes both short and long sleeve shirts.

To find out how many shirts were not washed, I subtract the number of washed shirts from the total number of shirts. So, 36 shirts minus 20 washed shirts equals 16 shirts that were not washed.

Therefore, Dave did not wash 16 shirts.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of shirts:**
   - **Short sleeve shirts:** 9

First, I need to determine how many potatoes the chef has left to cook. He initially needs to cook 9 potatoes and has already cooked 7, so there are 2 potatoes remaining.

Next, I should calculate the total cooking time required for the remaining potatoes. Each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, so for 2 potatoes, the total cooking time would be 2 multiplied by 3, which equals 6 minutes.

Finally, I will compare the total cooking time of the remaining potatoes with the time already spent. Since the chef has already cooked 7 potatoes, the cooking time for those is 7 multiplied by 3, which is 21 minutes. Subtracting the already cooked time from the total required time gives 21 minutes minus 6 minutes, resulting in 15 minutes remaining.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of potatoes remaining to cook:**
   
   - Total potatoes needed = 9
   - Already cooked = 7
   - Remaining potatoes = 9 - 7 = **2**

2. **Calculate the total cooking time required for the remaining potatoes:**
   
   - Time per potato = 3 minutes
   - Total time for 2 potatoes = 2 × 3 = **6 minutes**

3. **Calculate the total cooking time already spent:**
   
   - Already cooked potatoes = 7
   - Time spent = 7 × 3 = **21 minutes**

4. **Determine the remaining cooking time:**
   
   - Total required time = 21 minutes (already cooked)
   - Time remaining = 21 - 6 = **15 minutes**

**Final Answer:**

It will take the chef \(\boxed{15 \text{ minutes}}\) to cook the remaining potatoes.

                    question:
                     While on . vacation, Gwen took 41 pictures at the zoo and 29 at . the museum. If she later deleted 15 of the pictures, ? how many pictures from her vacation did she still have? 
                 Okay, so I have this problem here about Gwen and her pictures. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, the problem says that Gwen took 41 pictures at the zoo and 29 at the museum during her vacation. Then, she later deleted 15 pictures. The question is, how many pictures from her vacation does she still have?

Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down. She took a total number of pictures. To find the total, I should add the number she took at the zoo and the museum together. So, 41 plus 29. Let me do that math. 41 plus 29 is... 70? Wait, no, that's not right. 40 plus 30 is 70, and then 1 plus 9 is 10, so total is 80? No, wait, that's not correct either. Let me just add them properly.

41 plus 29: 40 plus 20 is 60, and 1 plus 9 is 10, so 60 plus 10 is 70. Oh, wait, no. Wait, 41 is 40 plus 1, and 29 is 20 plus 9. So, 40 plus 20 is 60, and 1 plus 9 is 10, so total is 70. Yeah, that's correct. So, she took a total of 70 pictures.

Now, she later deleted 15 of them. So, to find out how many she has left, I need to subtract the 15 deleted pictures from the total. So, 70 minus 15. Let me calculate that. 70 minus 10 is 60, and then minus 5 more is 55. So, 70 minus 15 is 55.

Wait a minute, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Maybe I should try another way. So, if she had 41 at the zoo and 29 at the museum, that's 70. She deleted 15, so she has 70 minus 15, which is 55. That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about it as subtracting the deletions from each category separately. But wait, the problem doesn't specify which category she deleted the pictures from. It just says she deleted 15 pictures in total. So, maybe she deleted some from the zoo and some from the museum. But since the problem doesn't specify how many from each, I can't assume that. Therefore, I should treat it as a total deletion.

So, the correct approach is to subtract the total number of deletions from the total number of pictures. So, 70 minus 15 is 55. So, she has 55 pictures left.

Let me just double-check my addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. 41 plus 29: 40 plus 20 is 60, and 1 plus 9 is 10, so 70. Yep, that's correct. And 70 minus 15 is definitely 55. So, I think that's the right answer.

Gwen took a total of 70 pictures (41 at the zoo + 29 at the museum). She later deleted 15, leaving her with 55 pictures.

                     A pet shelter had 2 puppies when another 34 were brought in. If 4 puppies a day ; are adopted, how long would it take for all of : them to be : adopted? 
                 Okay, so I have this problem here about a pet shelter with puppies. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, the shelter already has 2 puppies. Then, another 34 are brought in. So, that means the total number of puppies at the shelter now is 2 plus 34. Let me add those together: 2 + 34 equals 36. So, there are 36 puppies in total.

Next, the problem says that 4 puppies are adopted each day. I need to find out how long it will take for all of them to be adopted. So, I guess I need to divide the total number of puppies by the number adopted each day to find out the number of days required.

Let me write that down: total puppies (36) divided by puppies adopted per day (4). So, 36 divided by 4 equals 9. That means it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Wait, let me double-check. If 4 puppies are adopted each day, then after day 1, there are 32 left. Day 2, 28. Day 3, 24. Day 4, 20. Day 5, 16. Day 6, 12. Day 7, 8. Day 8, 4. Day 9, 0. Yep, that adds up. So, it does take 9 days.

So, the final answer is 9 days. So, if I were to put that in a box, it would be \boxed{9}. But wait, the instructions say to put the final answer within {The final answer is}. So, I think I should format it that way.

Wait, the initial problem says ""how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?"" So, the answer is 9 days. So, yes, that's correct.

I think that's all. I don't think I've missed anything. The shelter starts with 2, adds 34, so 36 total. 4 a day, so 36 divided by 4 is 9. Yep, that seems right.
</think>

The pet shelter starts with 2 puppies and adds 34 more, totaling 36. At a rate of 4 puppies adopted daily, it takes 36 divided by 4, which equals 9 days.

Then, instead of doing the remaining clothes all at once, he split the rest into 9 equal loads. Hmm, the question is asking how many pieces could go into each of these small loads. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, let me break this down. Will has a total of 59 pieces of clothing. He uses 32 of them in the first load. So, the remaining pieces would be 59 minus 32, which is... let me calculate that. 59 minus 32 is 27. So, he has 27 pieces left after the first load.

Now, he wants to split these remaining 27 pieces into 9 equal loads. So, each of these small loads will have the same number of pieces. To find out how many pieces each load has, I need to divide the remaining pieces by the number of loads. That is, 27 divided by 9. Let me do that division. 27 divided by 9 equals 3. So, each of the small loads will have 3 pieces of clothing.

Wait a minute, let me make sure I'm doing this right. If he splits 27 into 9 equal parts, each part should be 3. Because 9 times 3 is 27, which covers all the remaining pieces. So, that makes sense. Each load would have exactly 3 pieces. That seems straightforward.

But just to double-check, let me add it all up. The first load has 32 pieces, and each of the 9 small loads has 3 pieces. So, 9 times 3 is 27. Adding that to the initial 32 gives us 32 plus 27, which is indeed 59. So, that checks out.

Is there another way to think about this problem? Maybe using subtraction or division in a different way? Let's see. If he splits the remaining 27 into 9 equal parts, each part must be an integer since you can't have a fraction of a piece of clothing. So, 27 divided by 9 is exactly 3, which is an integer. That means each of the small loads will have 3 pieces.

Alternatively, could he have split them differently? For example, if he had a different number of loads, say 10, then each load would have 2.7 pieces, which isn't possible because you can't have a fraction of a piece. So, 9 is the right number of loads because it divides evenly into 27. Hence, each small load has 3 pieces.

Wait, let me think about the division again. If I have 27 pieces and 9 loads, then each load is 27 divided by 9. 9 goes into 27 three times. So, 3 pieces per load. That's clear.

Is there a way this could be a trick question? Maybe, but I don't see it. The problem seems straightforward. He splits the remaining 27 into 9 equal parts, each being 3. So, the answer should be 3.

Just to visualize, if each small load has 3 pieces, and there are 9 of them, that's 9 times 3, which is 27. Adding the initial 32, it totals 59. Yep, that all adds up correctly.

I think that's solid. No mistakes in the calculations. 59 minus 32 is 27, and 27 divided by 9 is 3. So, each small load has 3 pieces.
</think>

To determine how many pieces of clothing go into each of the small loads, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining pieces after the first load:**
   - Total pieces: 59
   - Pieces in the first load: 32
   - Remaining pieces: 59 - 32 = 27

2. **Divide the remaining pieces into 9 equal loads:**
   - Number of loads: 9
   - Pieces per load: 27 ÷ 9 = 3

**Answer:** Each small load contains 3 pieces of clothing.

                    question:
                     Adam bought 2 boxes of . chocolate candy and 5 boxes . of caramel : candy. If each box has 4 pieces inside it, how much candy did he have total? 
                 {Think step by step}
Okay, so Adam bought some candy, right? He bought two boxes of chocolate candy and five boxes of caramel candy. Hmm, I need to figure out how much candy he has in total. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let me think about the chocolate boxes. He bought two boxes, and each box has 4 pieces. So, to find out how many chocolate pieces he has, I should multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces per box. That would be 2 boxes multiplied by 4 pieces per box. Let me write that down: 2 * 4 = 8. So, he has 8 chocolate pieces.

Now, onto the caramel boxes. He bought five boxes, and each box also has 4 pieces. Similar to the chocolate, I need to calculate the total caramel pieces. So, that's 5 boxes times 4 pieces per box. Let me compute that: 5 * 4 = 20. So, he has 20 caramel pieces.

Wait, but the question is asking for the total candy he has. So, I need to add both the chocolate and the caramel pieces together. That would be the chocolate pieces (8) plus the caramel pieces (20). Let me add those: 8 + 20 = 28. So, in total, Adam has 28 pieces of candy.

Hmm, does that make sense? Let me double-check. Two boxes of chocolate at 4 each: 2*4=8. Five boxes of caramel at 4 each: 5*4=20. Adding them gives 8+20=28. Yeah, that seems right. So, the total candy Adam has is 28 pieces.
</think>

Adam bought 2 boxes of chocolate and 5 boxes of caramel, each containing 4 pieces. 

- Chocolate: 2 boxes * 4 pieces/box = 8 pieces
- Caramel: 5 boxes * 4 pieces/box = 20 pieces
- Total candy: 8 + 20 = 28 pieces

                 {The final answer is}
</think>

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Problem:**  
April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was \$6. If Katie bought 5 roses and 5 daisies, how much did she spend?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Sale:**  
   April's discount is offering each flower for \$6. This applies to both roses and daisies.

2. **Calculate Cost of Roses:**  
   Katie bought 5 roses.  
   Cost per rose = \$6  
   Total cost for roses = 5 roses × \$6 per rose  
   Total cost for roses = \$30

3. **Calculate Cost of Daisies:**  
   Katie bought 5 daisies.  
   Cost per daisy = \$6  
   Total cost for daisies = 5 daisies × \$6 per daisy  
   Total cost for daisies = \$30

4. **Total Amount Spent:**  
   Total cost = Cost of roses + Cost of daisies  
   Total cost = \$30 + \$30  
   Total cost = \$60

**Final Answer:**  
Katie spent \$60.

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
I need to determine how many new books Victor bought. He initially purchased 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books, making a total of 69 books.

He used 16 books, so the number of books he has left is 69 minus 16, which equals 53 books.

Since he initially had 69 books and used 16, he has 53 books remaining. Assuming he wants to keep all the books he initially bought, he needs to buy enough new books to make his total collection 53 books.

Therefore, the number of new books Victor needs to buy is 53 minus 69, which is -16. However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, indicating that Victor is likely selling or no longer needs the initial books.

Thus, Victor bought 16 new books.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   - Victor bought **32 adventure books** and **37 mystery books**.
   - **Total books initially bought = 32 + 37 = 69 books**.

2. **Books Used:**
   - Victor used **16 books**.
   - **Books remaining after use = Total books - Books used = 69 - 16 = 53 books**.

3. **Books Victor Keeps:**
   - It's implied that Victor wants to keep all his initial books.
   - However, since he used **16 books**, it's likely he no longer needs those specific books.
   - Therefore, Victor needs to **replace the 16 books he used** with new books.

4. **Number of New Books to Buy:**
   - **New books bought = Books used = 16 books**.

                 , 

Alright, let's try to figure out this carrot problem. So Maria has a garden, and she picked 48 carrots. Hmm, okay. Then she threw out 11 of them. Wait, so does that mean she's left with 48 minus 11? Let me do that math: 48 minus 11 is 37. So she has 37 carrots now.

But then, the next day, she picked 15 more. So I guess she went back to her garden and picked 15 more carrots. So now, how many does she have in total? Well, she had 37 from the previous day, and then she adds 15 more. So 37 plus 15... Let me add that. 37 plus 10 is 47, and then plus 5 more is 52. So she has 52 carrots in total.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. She started with 48, threw out 11, so 37 left. Then picked 15 more, so 37 plus 15 is indeed 52. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think she did any more actions mentioned in the problem. So the total number of carrots she has is 52.

                    question:
                     Jerry made 14 ? dollars mowing lawns and 31 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 5 dollar a week, how long would the money ; last him? 
                 Okay, let's try to figure out how long Jerry's money will last. So, Jerry has two sources of income: mowing lawns and weed eating. He made $14 ? dollars mowing lawns and $31 dollars from weed eating. Hmm, wait, the question says ""14 ? dollars."" I think that might be a typo or maybe some special notation. Maybe it's supposed to be $14? Or perhaps it's a variable like ""x."" Let me assume it's a typo and he made $14. So, total income from both activities would be $14 + $31, which is $45.

Now, Jerry only spent $5 a week. I need to find out how long his $45 will last at that weekly spending rate. To find out the duration, I can divide the total amount of money he has by the weekly expenditure. So, $45 divided by $5 per week equals 9 weeks. So, his money should last for 9 weeks.

Wait a second, the initial problem mentioned ""14 ? dollars."" Maybe that ""?"" is significant. Perhaps it's a variable, like 14 times some number. If it's not a typo, I need to consider that. Maybe the ""?"" represents a number of lawns he mowed or something. But without more information, it's hard to tell. If I take it as $14? where the ""?"" is a digit, it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's a multiplication symbol, like 14x dollars. If that's the case, we have two unknowns: x and the duration.

But the problem doesn't mention anything about the number of lawns or the rate for mowing, so maybe I should stick with the initial assumption that it's a typo and the amount is $14. So, total income is $45, spending is $5 per week, so 45 divided by 5 is 9 weeks. Therefore, the money will last for 9 weeks.

Alternatively, if ""14 ?"" is meant to represent 14 multiplied by some number, but since the second amount is given as $31, which is a fixed number, I think it's safe to assume that the first amount is also a fixed number, possibly with a typo. So, the answer is 9 weeks.
</think>

To determine how long Jerry's money will last, we first calculate his total income from mowing lawns and weed eating. 

- **Mowing Lawns:** Jerry earned $14? dollars. Assuming this is a typo and the amount is $14, he earned $14.
- **Weed Eating:** He earned $31.

**Total Income:**  
$14 + $31 = $45

Jerry spends $5 per week. To find out how long his $45 will last, we divide the total amount by the weekly expenditure:

\[
\frac{\$45}{\$5 \text{/week}} = 9 \text{ weeks}
\]

**Answer:** The money will last Jerry for 9 weeks.

**Step 1: Determine how many books Adam has after selling 11.**

\[
\text{Books after selling} = \text{Original books} - \text{Books sold} = 33 - 11 = 22
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of books Adam has after buying the new ones.**

Assuming that the money from selling 11 books is enough to buy 23 new books:

\[
\text{Total books} = \text{Books after selling} + \text{New books bought} = 22 + 23 = 45
\]

" Kaleb was collecting . cans . for recycling. On Saturday he filled 5 bags up and on Sunday he filled 5 more bags. If each bag had 4 cans in it, how many cans , did he pick up total? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>

                    question:
                     Kaleb was collecting . cans . for recycling. On Saturday he filled 5 bags up and on Sunday he filled 5 more bags. If each bag had 4 cans in it, how many cans , did he pick up total? 
                 Okay, so I need to figure out how many cans Kaleb picked up in total. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, Kaleb collected cans on Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday, he filled 5 bags. Each bag had 4 cans. So, I can calculate the number of cans he picked up on Saturday by multiplying the number of bags by the number of cans per bag.

Let me write that down. Saturday cans = 5 bags * 4 cans per bag. Hmm, 5 times 4 is 20. So, he picked up 20 cans on Saturday.

Now, on Sunday, he filled another 5 bags. Each bag also had 4 cans. So, I can use the same calculation for Sunday's cans. Sunday cans = 5 bags * 4 cans per bag. Again, that's 5 times 4, which is 20 cans.

Now, to find the total cans he picked up, I need to add the cans from both days together. So, total cans = Saturday cans + Sunday cans. That would be 20 cans + 20 cans, which equals 40 cans.

Wait, let me double-check that. Saturday: 5 bags * 4 cans = 20. Sunday: 5 bags * 4 cans = 20. Total: 20 + 20 = 40. Yeah, that seems right.

Is there another way to approach this? Maybe. Instead of calculating each day separately, I could think of it as two sets of 5 bags. So, 2 sets * 5 bags each * 4 cans per bag. But wait, that would be 2 times 20, which is 40. Same result.

Alternatively, I could consider the total number of bags first. He filled 5 bags on Saturday and 5 on Sunday, so 10 bags in total. Then, since each bag has 4 cans, 10 bags * 4 cans = 40 cans. That also gives the same answer.

So, regardless of the method I use, the total number of cans Kaleb picked up is 40.

I think I'm confident with this answer. It makes sense because each day he collected the same amount, so doubling it gives the total.
</think>

Kaleb collected cans on both Saturday and Sunday. Each day, he filled 5 bags with 4 cans each. 

- **Saturday:** 5 bags × 4 cans = 20 cans
- **Sunday:** 5 bags × 4 cans = 20 cans

**Total cans collected:** 20 + 20 = 40 cans.

{The final answer is 40 cans.}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",40

                    question:
                    ?  Nancy ! was organizing her book case making , sure each of the shelves had exactly 6 books on it. , If she had 2 shelves of mystery books and 6 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total? 
                 Okay, so Nancy is organizing her bookcase. She wants each shelf to have exactly 6 books. She has two types of books: mystery books and picture books. She has 2 shelves of mystery books and 6 shelves of picture books. The question is asking how many books she has in total.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out how many mystery books there are and how many picture books, and then add them together for the total number.

She has 2 shelves of mystery books. Since each shelf has exactly 6 books, I can multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf to get the total mystery books. So that's 2 shelves * 6 books per shelf. Let me calculate that: 2 * 6 equals 12. So there are 12 mystery books.

Next, she has 6 shelves of picture books. Using the same logic, each shelf has 6 books, so 6 shelves * 6 books per shelf. That's 6 * 6, which is 36. So there are 36 picture books.

Now, to find the total number of books, I just need to add the mystery and picture books together. That would be 12 + 36. Let me add those up: 12 + 36 equals 48. So Nancy has a total of 48 books.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Two shelves with 6 books each: 2*6=12. Six shelves with 6 books each: 6*6=36. Adding them together: 12+36=48. Yeah, that seems correct.
</think>

Nancy has 2 shelves of mystery books, each containing 6 books. So, the total number of mystery books is 2 × 6 = 12.

She also has 6 shelves of picture books, each containing 6 books. Therefore, the total number of picture books is 6 × 6 = 36.

Adding the two quantities together gives the total number of books: 12 + 36 = 48.

{The final answer is} 48.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",48

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Paul had saved up 3 dollars. If he received another 7 dollars for ! his allowance, how many 5 dollar ; toys could he buy? 
                 Okay, so Paul has saved up 3 dollars, and he gets another 7 dollars for his allowance. I need to figure out how many 5 dollar toys he could buy with that. Hmm, let me think.

First, I should probably figure out how much money Paul has in total now. He had 3 dollars saved, and he gets another 7 dollars. So, adding those together, that's 3 + 7, which is 10 dollars. Okay, so he has 10 dollars in total.

Now, the question is how many 5 dollar toys he can buy with that 10 dollars. I remember that to find out how many times a number fits into another, you divide the total by the cost per item. So, in this case, it would be 10 divided by 5.

Let me do that calculation. 10 divided by 5 is 2. So, he can buy 2 toys. Wait, is that all? Let me double-check. If he buys one toy, that's 5 dollars, leaving him with 5 dollars. Then, another toy would be another 5, totaling 10. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think there's any extra cents or anything mentioned, so all the money can be used for the toys. So, 2 toys it is. I don't see any other factors here, like tax or something else reducing the amount. So, yeah, 2 is the answer.
</think>

Paul initially has \$3. After receiving an additional \$7, he has a total of \$3 + \$7 = \$10.

To determine how many \$5 toys he can buy, divide the total amount by the cost per toy:
\[
\frac{10}{5} = 2
\]

Therefore, Paul can buy \boxed{2} toys. {The final answer is}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",2

                    question:
                     Wendy was playing a video game and had 43 lives. In a hard part of the game she lost 8 lives. If she . got 39 more lives in the next level, ; how . many lives would she have? 
                 Okay, so Wendy has 43 lives in the video game. Hmm, the problem says she lost 8 lives in a hard part. Losing lives means subtracting from her total. So I need to subtract 8 from 43. Let me do that: 43 minus 8 is 35. So she now has 35 lives left.

Now, the next part says she got 39 more lives in the next level. Okay, so she gains 39 lives. I need to add that to her current total. So 35 plus 39. Let me calculate that: 35 + 39 is 74. So adding them together gives her 74 lives.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 43 minus 8 is definitely 35 because 43 minus 10 would be 33, and adding back 2 gives 35. Then 35 plus 39... Hmm, 35 plus 40 is 75, so subtracting 1 gives 74. Yeah, that seems right.

So, after losing 8 lives and then gaining 39, her total lives are 74. I don't think I missed anything in the problem. It just says she had 43, lost 8, then got 39 more. No other information is given, so this should be the correct answer.
</think>

Wendy starts with 43 lives. She loses 8 lives in a hard part of the game, reducing her total to 35. Then, she gains 39 more lives, bringing her total to 74.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Initial Lives:** Wendy begins with 43 lives.
2. **Loss of Lives:** She loses 8 lives, so her total becomes \( 43 - 8 = 35 \).
3. **Gain of Lives:** She then gains 39 lives, so her total becomes \( 35 + 39 = 74 \).

First, I need to determine the total number of files Katie had initially, which is 85.

Next, she deleted 40 files, so I'll subtract those from the total. That leaves her with 85 minus 40, which equals 45 files remaining.

Since she wants to put the remaining files into folders with 5 files each, I'll divide the number of remaining files by 5. Dividing 45 by 5 gives me 9.

Therefore, Katie ends up with 9 folders.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Total files initially:**  
   Katie had **85** files on her computer.

2. **Files deleted:**  
   She deleted **40** files.

3. **Remaining files:**  
   To find the number of files left after deletion:
   \[
   85 - 40 = 45
   \]
   So, **45** files remain.

4. **Files per folder:**  
   Each folder holds **5** files.

5. **Number of folders needed:**  
   To determine how many folders are needed, divide the remaining files by the number of files per folder:
   \[
   \frac{45}{5} = 9

                    question:
                     Will was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 8 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 8 hours ; and on ; Tuesday he worked 2 , hours. How much money did Will make in . those two days? 
                 Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Will made in those two days. Let me see... He works at a grocery store and gets 8 dollars an hour. On Monday, he worked 8 hours, and on Tuesday, he worked 2 hours. Hmm, right.

First, I should probably calculate how much he earned each day and then add them together to get the total. That makes sense because the question is asking for the total money he made in those two days.

So, starting with Monday. He worked 8 hours at $8 per hour. To find his earnings for the day, I can multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate. Let me write that down: 8 hours * $8/hour. Hmm, 8 times 8 is 64, so that would be $64. Okay, that's straightforward.

Now, moving on to Tuesday. He worked 2 hours at the same rate, which is still $8 per hour. So again, I can multiply the hours by the hourly rate. That would be 2 hours * $8/hour. Calculating that, 2 times 8 is 16. So, he earned $16 on Tuesday.

Wait, let me double-check that. 8 dollars times 8 hours is indeed 64, and 8 dollars times 2 hours is 16. Yep, that seems right.

Now, to find the total money he made over both days, I need to add the earnings from Monday and Tuesday. So, that would be $64 plus $16. Let me do that addition. 64 plus 16 is 80. So, the total amount he made is $80.

Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. On Monday: 8 hours * $8 = $64. Tuesday: 2 hours * $8 = $16. Total is $64 + $16 = $80. Yep, that checks out.

I don't think I missed anything here. The problem didn't mention any breaks, different pay rates, or other factors, so it's just straightforward hourly calculation for each day and then summing them. So, the total should be $80.
</think>

To determine how much Will earned in those two days, we calculate his earnings for each day separately and then sum them.

1. **Monday's Earnings:**
   - Hours worked: 8
   - Hourly rate: $8
   - Calculation: 8 hours * $8/hour = $64

2. **Tuesday's Earnings:**
   - Hours worked: 2
   - Hourly rate: $8
   - Calculation: 2 hours * $8/hour = $16

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Monday's earnings + Tuesday's earnings = $64 + $16 = $80

First, I note that Carol initially made 19 cupcakes.

She sold 6 of them, so she has 19 minus 6, which equals 13 cupcakes left.

**Solution:**

1. **Initial Number of Cupcakes:**
   - Carol made **19** cupcakes initially.

2. **Cupcakes Sold:**
   - She sold **6** cupcakes.

                 {Think step by step}

Okay, so I have this problem here about a trivia team. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes I get confused with word problems, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says: A trivia team had 14 members total, but during a game, 7 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 5 points, how many points were scored in total?

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the team has 14 members. But 7 didn't show up. So, how many members actually participated? Let me subtract the ones who didn't show from the total. So, 14 minus 7 equals... 7 members showed up. Got that.

Now, each of these 7 members scored 5 points. I need to find the total points scored. So, I think I need to multiply the number of members who showed up by the points each scored. That makes sense because if each person gets 5 points, then 7 people would get 5 points each.

Let me write that out: 7 members * 5 points/member. So, 7 times 5 is... 35. So, the total points scored would be 35.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 14 total minus 7 not showing is 7 showing. Each scores 5, so 7 times 5 is 35. Yep, that seems right.

I don't think there's anything else to it. The problem doesn't mention any bonuses or different scoring systems, so it's just straightforward multiplication. Yeah, I'm confident the total points scored is 35.
</think>

The team initially has 14 members, but 7 don't show up, leaving 7 participants. Each participant scores 5 points, so the total points are calculated as 7 multiplied by 5, which equals 35.

{The final answer is} 35 points.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",35

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
I need to determine the total points scored by the trivia team. 

First, there are 5 members on the team. However, 2 members did not show up, so 3 members participated.

Each participating member scored 6 points. Therefore, I multiply the number of participants by the points per participant: 3 members * 6 points = 18 points.

Thus, the total points scored by the team is 18.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Total Members:** The trivia team initially has **5** members.
2. **Members Absent:** During the game, **2** members did not show up.
3. **Members Present:** Subtract the absent members from the total:
   \[
   5 \text{ total members} - 2 \text{ absent members} = 3 \text{ present members}
   \]
4. **Points per Member:** Each present member scores **6** points.
5. **Total Points:** Multiply the number of present members by the points per member:

                     Oliver is at the library helping put ! away books. : There are 46 book to ! put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how . many shelves will he need? 
                 Okay, so I need to figure out how many shelves Oliver will need to put away the remaining books after the librarian took 10. He can fit 4 books on each shelf. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the total number of books is 46. The librarian took 10 of them, so how many are left? I subtract 10 from 46. 46 minus 10 is 36. So, Oliver has 36 books left to put away.

Now, he can fit 4 books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves he needs, I think I have to divide the total number of books by the number he can put on each shelf. So, 36 divided by 4. Let me do that calculation. 36 divided by 4 is 9. So, he would need 9 shelves.

Wait a minute, is there any chance that he might need an extra shelf if there's a remainder? Let me think. If he divides the books evenly, 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, with no remainder. So, he doesn't need an extra shelf. That means 9 shelves are enough.

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Total books: 46. Librarian took 10, so 36 left. Each shelf holds 4, so 36 divided by 4 is 9. Yep, that seems right.

I don't think I missed anything. The problem doesn't mention any other constraints, like varying sizes of books or different shelf capacities. It's just a straightforward division problem after subtracting the books taken by the librarian.

So, putting it all together: 46 total books minus 10 taken by the librarian equals 36. Then, 36 divided by 4 books per shelf equals 9 shelves needed. I don't see any errors in that logic.
</think>

Oliver starts with 46 books. After the librarian takes 10, he has 36 left. He can put 4 books on each shelf, so he needs 9 shelves.

                 {Think step by step}
Okay, so Luke is putting his spare change into piles. He has 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes. Each pile has 3 coins in it. I need to figure out how many coins he has in total.

First, I should figure out how many quarters he has. He has 5 piles of quarters, and each pile has 3 coins. So, the total number of quarters would be the number of piles multiplied by the number of coins per pile. That would be 5 times 3, which is 15 quarters.

Next, I need to find out how many dimes he has. Similarly, he has 5 piles of dimes, and each pile also has 3 coins. So, the total number of dimes is 5 times 3, which is 15 dimes.

Now, to find the total number of coins, I should add the number of quarters and dimes together. So, 15 quarters plus 15 dimes equals 30 coins in total.

Wait, let me double-check that. 5 piles of quarters times 3 coins each: 5 * 3 = 15. 5 piles of dimes times 3 coins each: 5 * 3 = 15. Adding them together: 15 + 15 = 30. Yeah, that seems right.
</think>

Luke has 5 piles of quarters, each containing 3 coins, resulting in 5 × 3 = 15 quarters. Similarly, he has 5 piles of dimes, each with 3 coins, totaling 5 × 3 = 15 dimes. Adding these together, he has 15 + 15 = 30 coins in total.

**Question:**  
Kaleb bought 14 boxes of ? chocolate candy and gave 5 . to . his little brother. If each box has 6 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Kaleb still have?

---

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Kaleb has 14 boxes of chocolate candy.
   - Each box contains 6 pieces.
   - He gives 5 pieces to his little brother.
   - We need to find out how many pieces Kaleb still has.

                <think>
To determine how many pictures are in each of Robin's albums, I'll start by analyzing the total number of photos she uploaded.

Robin uploaded a total of 31 pictures from her phone and 5 from her camera, which means she has 36 pictures in total.

Next, she sorted these pictures into 9 different albums, and each album has the same number of pictures. To find out how many pictures are in each album, I'll divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

So, 36 divided by 9 equals 4. This means that each album contains 4 pictures.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's determine how many pictures are in each album step by step.

1. **Total Number of Pictures:**
   
   Robin uploaded:
   - 31 pictures from her phone.
   - 5 pictures from her camera.
   
   **Total pictures = 31 + 5 = 36**

2. **Number of Albums:**
   
   Robin sorted the pictures into **9 different albums**.

3. **Number of Pictures per Album:**
   
   Since the pictures are equally distributed into the albums, we can find the number of pictures per album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

   \[
   \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{\text{Total pictures}}{\text{Number of albums}} = \frac{36}{9} = 4

                    question:
                     Mike made 69 dollars mowing lawns over ! the summer. If he spent 24 dollars buying new mower : blades, how many 5 dollar games : could he buy with the money he had left? 
                 okay, so Mike earned $69 mowing lawns over the summer. He spent $24 buying a new mower, which includes blades. Now, he wants to know how many 5-dollar games he could buy with the money he has left. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out how much money Mike has left after buying the mower. He started with $69. He spent $24 on the mower. So, subtracting the amount he spent from his total earnings should give me the remaining money.

So, 69 minus 24. Let me calculate that. 69 minus 20 is 49, and then minus 4 more is 45. So, he has $45 left.

Now, he wants to know how many 5-dollar games he can buy with $45. Since each game costs $5, I can divide the remaining amount by 5 to find out how many games he can purchase.

45 divided by 5 is 9. So, Mike can buy 9 games with the money he has left.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 69 minus 24 is indeed 45, and 45 divided by 5 is 9. Yep, that seems correct.
</think>

Mike earned $69 mowing lawns. He spent $24 on a new mower. To find out how much money he has left, subtract the amount he spent from his earnings:

\[
69 - 24 = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, to determine how many 5-dollar games he can buy with the remaining \$45, divide the amount by the cost per game:

\[
\frac{45}{5} = 9
\]

So, Mike can buy \boxed{9} 5-dollar games.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",9

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Maria bought 2 new chairs and . 2 new tables for her ? house. If she spent 8 minutes on each piece furniture putting it together, how many minutes did it take her to ? finish? 
                 Okay, so Maria bought 2 new chairs and 2 new tables for her house. She spent 8 minutes on each piece of furniture putting it together. I need to figure out how many minutes it took her to finish all the furniture. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I should figure out how much time she spent on each item. She bought 2 chairs and 2 tables. Each piece took 8 minutes to assemble. So, for each chair, it's 8 minutes, and for each table, it's also 8 minutes.

Wait, does that mean she spent 8 minutes on each individual piece, regardless of what it is? So, each chair and each table took 8 minutes each. That would mean for 2 chairs, it's 2 times 8 minutes, and for 2 tables, it's also 2 times 8 minutes.

So, chairs: 2 chairs * 8 minutes each = 16 minutes.
Tables: 2 tables * 8 minutes each = 16 minutes.

Then, total time would be chairs plus tables, which is 16 + 16 = 32 minutes.

But wait, is there another way to look at it? Maybe considering that she worked on both at the same time? But the problem doesn't specify if she worked simultaneously on multiple pieces or one after another. It just says she spent 8 minutes on each piece. So, I think it's safer to assume she did one after another, so total time is additive.

Alternatively, if she worked on multiple pieces at once, maybe the time could be less, but since the problem doesn't specify, I can't assume that. So, I should stick with the total time being 32 minutes.

So, the answer is 32 minutes.
</think>

Maria bought 2 chairs and 2 tables. Each piece took 8 minutes to assemble. 

Total time for chairs: 2 × 8 = 16 minutes  
Total time for tables: 2 × 8 = 16 minutes  
Total time = 16 + 16 = 32 minutes

                 Given the problem, the user is to find out how many pictures Rachel still has after deleting 6. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says she took 6 pictures at the zoo and 9 at the museum, so total 15 pictures. Then she deleted 11 of them. So how many does she have left? Hmm, but the problem also has some symbols, which is unclear. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the problem is written with some typos or odd symbols. It says: ""Rachel took 6 pictures at the zoo and ! 9 at the museum. If she later deleted 11 of the : pictures, how many pictures from her . vacation did she still have?"" It seems like there are some extra characters, like ""!"", "":"", and ""."" Maybe they are typos. So perhaps it's supposed to be ""Rachel took 6 pictures at the zoo and 9 at the museum. If she later deleted 11 of the pictures, how many pictures from her vacation did she still have?"" That would make more sense. So I think the user intended to write that, maybe with some formatting issues.

So, to solve the problem, I can start by determining the total number of pictures Rachel took. She took 6 at the zoo and 9 at the museum, so that's 6 + 9 = 15 pictures in total. Then, she deleted 11 of them. To find out how many she has left, I can subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total.

So, 15 total pictures minus 11 deleted pictures equals 4 pictures remaining. Therefore, Rachel still has 4 pictures from her vacation.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret anything. The original problem had some extra characters. Maybe the numbers are in different places? Let me check again. It says: ""Rachel took 6 pictures at the zoo and ! 9 at the museum. If she later deleted 11 of the : pictures, how many pictures from her . vacation did she still have?"" So, it's 6, then ""!"", then 9, then "":"" and ""11"", and then "". vacation."" Hmm, perhaps the numbers are 6, 9, and 11, but the other characters are just typos.

So, ignoring the extra characters, the numbers are 6, 9, and 11. So total is 6 + 9 = 15. She deletes 11, so 15 - 11 = 4. That seems correct.

Alternatively, if the numbers are in different positions, maybe she took 6 at the zoo and 9 at the museum, but then she had 11 in a different context. Wait, no, the problem says she later deleted 11 of the pictures. So the 11 is the number deleted.

So, to recap:

Total pictures = zoo + museum = 6 + 9 = 15.

Pictures deleted = 11.

Pictures remaining = 15 - 11 = 4.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be 4 pictures.

Rachel took a total of 15 pictures (6 at the zoo and 9 at the museum). After deleting 11, she has 4 pictures left.

                <think>
First, I need to determine the cost of each type of flower Zoe purchased.

Zoe bought 8 roses. Since each rose costs $3, I multiply 8 by $3 to find the total cost for the roses.

Next, she bought 2 daisies. Each daisy also costs $3, so I multiply 2 by $3 to calculate the cost of the daisies.

Finally, I add the total cost of the roses and the daisies to find the overall amount Zoe spent.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the cost per flower:**
   - Each rose costs \$3.
   - Each daisy also costs \$3.

2. **Calculate the total cost for roses:**

                 Alright, so Bianca has this book case with shelves. Each shelf has exactly 8 books. She has shelves for mystery books and picture books. Specifically, there are 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books. I need to figure out the total number of books she has. Hmm, okay.

First, I should think about what each type of shelf contributes to the total number of books. Each shelf has 8 books, so if there are multiple shelves, I can multiply the number of shelves by 8 to get the total for that category.

So for the mystery books, there are 5 shelves. Each of those shelves has 8 books. So I can calculate the total number of mystery books by multiplying 5 times 8. Let me write that down: 5 * 8 = 40. So Bianca has 40 mystery books.

Next, for the picture books, there are 4 shelves. Each shelf also has 8 books. So similarly, I can calculate the total number of picture books by multiplying 4 by 8. That would be 4 * 8 = 32. So she has 32 picture books.

Now, to find the total number of books Bianca has, I need to add the number of mystery books and picture books together. So that's 40 (mystery) + 32 (picture) = 72. Therefore, Bianca has a total of 72 books.

Wait, let me just double-check that. 5 shelves with 8 books each: 5*8=40. 4 shelves with 8 books each: 4*8=32. Adding 40 and 32 gives 72. Yep, that seems right. So the total number of books Bianca has is 72.
</think>

Bianca has a total of 72 books.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Calculate the number of mystery books:**
   - There are 5 shelves of mystery books.
   - Each shelf holds 8 books.
   - Total mystery books = 5 shelves * 8 books per shelf = 40 books.

2. **Calculate the number of picture books:**
   - There are 4 shelves of picture books.
   - Each shelf holds 8 books.
   - Total picture books = 4 shelves * 8 books per shelf = 32 books.

3. **Find the total number of books:**
   - Add the number of mystery books and picture books.
   - Total books = 40 (mystery) + 32 (picture) = 72 books.

Maybe it's supposed to say ""Isabel baked 3 brownies, but needed 5 total for her party."" And then, ""If she used 5 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?""

Okay, that makes more sense. So she baked 3 brownies but needs 5 in total. So she needs to make more brownies. Each brownie uses 5 cups of flour. So she needs to figure out how much flour she needs in total to make the remaining brownies.

Let me break it down. She has already baked 3 brownies. Each brownie uses 5 cups of flour. So she has used 3 * 5 = 15 cups of flour so far.

But she needs a total of 5 brownies for her party. She has already baked 3, so she needs to bake 5 - 3 = 2 more brownies.

Each of those 2 brownies will also require 5 cups of flour, so she needs 2 * 5 = 10 cups of flour for the remaining brownies.

Therefore, the total flour she needs is the flour already used plus the flour needed for the remaining brownies. That's 15 cups + 10 cups = 25 cups.

Wait, but let me double-check. She needs 5 brownies in total. She has 3, so she needs 2 more. Each uses 5 cups, so 10 cups. She already used 15, so total needed is 25. That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking how much flour she still needs, not the total. If she already used 15 cups, and needs 10 more, then she still needs 10 cups.

But the wording is a bit unclear. It says, ""how much cups of flour . does she still need?"" The period after ""need"" might be a typo. So maybe it's asking for the total needed, which would be 25 cups. Or if she already used 15, she needs 10 more.

Wait, let me read the problem again: ""Isabel baked 3 brownies, but needed 5 total for her party. If she used 5 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?""

Hmm, maybe it's asking for the total needed, not the additional needed. So she needs 5 brownies, each using 5 cups, so 5 * 5 = 25 cups in total. But she already used 15, so she needs 25 - 15 = 10 more cups.

But the problem doesn't specify whether it's the total needed or the additional needed. It says ""how much cups of flour . does she still need?"" The period is after ""need,"" which might mean it's a typo, and it's supposed to be ""does she still need?"" So perhaps the total needed.

Wait, but she already baked some, so the ""still need"" implies the additional needed. So she needs 10 more cups.

But to be safe, let me consider both interpretations.

If the question is asking for the total flour needed for all 5 brownies, it's 25 cups. If it's asking for the additional flour needed beyond what she already used, it's 10 cups.

Given the phrasing, ""how much cups of flour . does she still need?"" The word ""still"" suggests it's the additional amount needed on top of what she already used. So 10 cups.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the problem is just asking for the total needed, regardless of what she already used. It's a bit ambiguous.

Wait, let's look at the original problem again:

""Isabel baked 3 brownies, ? but . needed 5 total for her party. If she used 5 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour . does she still need?""

The first part is cut off, but it seems like she baked 3 but needed 5",10

                    question:
                     . Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair. He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth and decided to use the rest on ? rides. ! If : each ride cost 4 tickets, how many rides could he go on? 
                 . Okay, so I have this problem here where Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair. He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth and decided to use the rest on ? rides. Each ride costs 4 tickets. How many rides could he go on?

Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slowly.

First, Tom bought 40 tickets in total. So, that's our starting point. Now, he spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth. So, he used 28 tickets on that. I guess the rest of the tickets he wants to use on other rides.

So, to find out how many tickets he has left after spending 28 at the booth, I can subtract 28 from 40. Let me write that down.

Total tickets: 40

Tickets used at booth: 28

So, tickets remaining = 40 - 28

Let me calculate that. 40 minus 28 is... 12? Hmm, wait, 28 plus 12 is 40, right? Yeah, that seems correct. So he has 12 tickets left.

Now, each ride costs 4 tickets. So, he wants to know how many rides he can go on with the remaining 12 tickets. So, how do I find that?

I think I need to divide the number of remaining tickets by the cost per ride. That should give me the number of rides he can afford.

So, rides possible = tickets remaining / tickets per ride

Plugging in the numbers:

rides possible = 12 / 4

12 divided by 4 is 3. So, he can go on 3 rides.

Wait, let me double-check that. If each ride is 4 tickets, then 3 rides would cost 3 times 4, which is 12 tickets. That's exactly the number he has left. So that makes sense.

Hmm, but let me think again. Is there another way this could be approached? Maybe by considering the total cost of the rides he wants to take.

He wants to use the remaining tickets on rides. Each ride is 4 tickets, so the total cost for rides would be 4 times the number of rides.

So, total cost for rides = 4 * rides

And this total cost should be equal to the remaining tickets, which is 12.

So, 4 * rides = 12

Then, rides = 12 / 4 = 3.

Same answer. So that confirms it.

I guess I was overcomplicating it at first, but breaking it down step by step helped me see it clearly. So, the key steps were:

1. Subtract the tickets used at the booth from the total tickets to find remaining tickets.
2. Divide the remaining tickets by the cost per ride to find the number of rides possible.

I don't see any mistakes in that logic. It seems straightforward.

Wait, just another thought: The problem says Tom decided to use the rest on ? rides. So, maybe the question mark was indicating that the number of rides is unknown, and we have to find it. So, yeah, that's exactly what we did. We found that he can go on 3 rides.

So, putting it all together, the answer is 3 rides.

**Final Answer**
Tom could go on \boxed{3} rides.
</think>

Tom bought 40 tickets in total. He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth, so the remaining tickets are calculated as follows:

\[
40 - 28 = 12
\]

Each ride costs 4 tickets. To find out how many rides Tom can go on, we divide the remaining tickets by the cost per ride:

\[
\frac{12}{4} = 3
\]

Thus, Tom could go on \boxed{3} rides.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",3

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
I need to determine how many towels Maria has after giving 34 towels to her mother.

First, Maria initially has 35 green towels and 21 white towels, making a total of 35 + 21 = 56 towels.

She gives her mother 34 towels. I don't know which color towels she gave, so I'll consider both possibilities: giving only green towels, only white towels, or a combination of both.

If Maria gave only green towels: 35 - 34 = 1 green towel remaining. She still has all 21 white towels. So, 1 + 21 = 22 towels in total.

If Maria gave only white towels: She only has 21 white towels, so she can't give 34 towels. This scenario isn't possible.

If Maria gave a combination of green and white towels: She would have fewer than 35 green towels and fewer than 21 white towels. However, since she can't give more towels than she has of any color, the only realistic scenario is giving only green towels.

Therefore, Maria ends up with 22 towels.
</think>

**Solution:**

Maria initially has:
- **35 green towels**
- **21 white towels**

Total towels = 35 + 21 = **56 towels**

She gives her mother **34 towels**. We need to determine how many towels Maria has left.

**Step 1: Determine the possible scenarios**

1. **Giving only green towels:**
   - She has 35 green towels.
   - If she gives 34 green towels, she'll have:
     - Green towels left = 35 - 34 = **1**
     - White towels remain = **21**

2. **Giving only white towels:**
   - She has 21 white towels.
   - She cannot give 34 white towels because she only has 21. This scenario is **not possible**.

3. **Giving a combination of green and white towels:**
   - She could give some green and some white towels.
   - However, since she cannot give more towels than she has of any color, this scenario is **also not possible**.

**Step 2: Conclusion**

The only feasible scenario is giving only green towels. Therefore, Maria ends up with:
- **1 green towel**
- **21 white towels**

**Total towels left = 1 + 21 = 22**

                    question:
                    ,  Paul was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday : he filled 6 bags : up and on Sunday he filled 3 more bags. If each bag had 8 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total? 
                


Okay, so Paul was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday, he filled 6 bags, and on Sunday, he filled 3 more bags. Each bag had 8 cans in it. I need to find out the total number of cans he picked up. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably figure out how many cans he filled on each day separately and then add them together. That makes sense because the total cans would be the sum of the cans from Saturday and Sunday.

So, starting with Saturday. He filled 6 bags, and each bag had 8 cans. To find out how many cans that is, I can multiply the number of bags by the number of cans per bag. That would be 6 bags multiplied by 8 cans per bag. Let me calculate that: 6 times 8 is 48. So, he picked up 48 cans on Saturday.

Next, on Sunday, he filled 3 more bags. Each bag also had 8 cans. So, similarly, I can multiply 3 bags by 8 cans per bag. That would be 3 times 8, which equals 24. So, he picked up 24 cans on Sunday.

Now, to find the total number of cans he collected over the weekend, I need to add the cans from Saturday and Sunday together. That would be 48 cans from Saturday plus 24 cans from Sunday. Let me add those: 48 plus 24 is 72. So, altogether, Paul picked up 72 cans.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, 6 bags on Saturday at 8 cans each: 6 times 8 is indeed 48. On Sunday, 3 bags times 8 cans is 24. Adding 48 and 24 gives 72. Yep, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I could think of it as the total number of bags he filled. He filled 6 on Saturday and 3 on Sunday, so that's a total of 9 bags. If each bag has 8 cans, then 9 bags times 8 cans per bag would be 72 cans. That's another way to confirm the same answer.

So, both methods give me the same total, which makes me more confident that 72 is the correct number of cans Paul collected.

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
First, I need to determine the total pounds of paper recycled by Bianca and her friends. Bianca recycled 24 pounds, and her friends recycled 3 pounds. So, the total recycled is 24 + 3 = 27 pounds.

Next, since they earn one point for every 3 pounds recycled, I'll divide the total pounds by 3 to find out how many points they earned. 27 pounds divided by 3 pounds per point equals 9 points.

Therefore, Bianca and her friends earned a total of 9 points from recycling.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Bianca recycled **24 pounds**.
- Her friends recycled **3 pounds**.
- **1 point** is earned for every **3 pounds** recycled.

**Step 1: Calculate the total pounds recycled.**
\[
\text{Total pounds} = \text{Bianca's recycling} + \text{Friends' recycling} = 24\ \text{lbs} + 3\ \text{lbs} = 27\ \text{lbs}

**Step 2: Determine how many points they earned.**
\[
\text{Points earned} = \frac{\text{Total pounds}}{\text{Pounds per point}} = \frac{27\ \text{lbs}}{3\ \text{lbs per point}} = 9\ \text{points}

                    question:
                     A group of 3 friends went into a , restaurant. The chef already had ? 8 chicken wings cooked but cooked 10 more for the group. If they each got the same amount how many would each person get? . 
                 {The final answer is}

Okay, so I have this problem here: there are three friends who go into a restaurant. The chef already had 8 chicken wings cooked, but then he cooked 10 more for the group. The question is, if each friend gets the same amount, how many chicken wings would each person get? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. We have three friends, and the chef has some chicken wings. Initially, he has 8 cooked, but he cooks 10 more specifically for this group. So, the total number of chicken wings the chef has now is 8 plus 10. Let me write that down.

Total chicken wings = 8 (already cooked) + 10 (cooked for the group) = 18 chicken wings.

Now, these chicken wings are to be distributed equally among the three friends. So, each friend should get the same number of wings. That means I need to divide the total number of wings by the number of friends.

Number of friends = 3.

So, each person gets total wings divided by number of friends.

Each person gets = Total wings ÷ Number of friends = 18 ÷ 3.

Wait, let me do that division. 18 divided by 3 is 6. So, each person gets 6 chicken wings.

But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me double-check. If each gets 6, then three people get 6 each. So, 6 times 3 is 18. That adds up to the total number of wings, which is correct.

So, I think the answer is 6 chicken wings per person.

**Final Answer**
{The final answer is 6}
</think>

First, we determine the total number of chicken wings the chef has, which is the sum of the already cooked wings and the additional wings cooked for the group:
\[
8 \text{ (already cooked)} + 10 \text{ (cooked for the group)} = 18 \text{ chicken wings}
\]

Next, we need to distribute these 18 chicken wings equally among the three friends. We do this by dividing the total number of wings by the number of friends:
\[
\frac{18}{3} = 6
\]

Each friend gets 6 chicken wings. Verifying this, 3 friends each receiving 6 wings gives:
\[
6 \times 3 = 18
\]
which matches the total number of wings available.

Thus, the final answer is:

                 {Let me think...}

Okay, so John has 33 socks to start with. Then he throws away 19 old ones that don't fit. Hmm, so if he had 33 and threw away 19, how many does he have left? Let me do the subtraction: 33 minus 19. Wait, that's 14 socks left. But then he bought 13 new ones. So I need to add those 13 to the remaining 14. So 14 plus 13 is... let me see, 14 plus 10 is 24, and then plus 3 more is 27. So he would have 27 socks in total now. 

Wait, let me double-check that. Starting with 33, subtract 19 gives 14. Adding 13 gives 27. Yeah, that seems right. So the final number of socks he has is 27.
</think>

John started with 33 socks. After throwing away 19 old ones, he has \(33 - 19 = 14\) socks left. He then buys 13 new ones, so the total number of socks is \(14 + 13 = 27\).

Okay, so I have this problem here about the school's baseball team. They have 2 new players and 6 returning players. The coach wants to put them into groups with 4 players in each group. I need to figure out how many groups there will be. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I should figure out the total number of players on the team. They mentioned 2 new players and 6 returning ones. So, adding those together: 2 + 6 equals 8 players in total. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, the coach wants to divide these 8 players into groups where each group has 4 players. So, I guess I need to see how many groups of 4 can be formed from 8 players. Hmm, how do I do that?

Well, if I have 8 players and each group has 4, I can think about how many times 4 goes into 8. Let me recall, division is the inverse of multiplication. So, if I have 8 divided by 4, that should give me the number of groups. Let me calculate that: 8 ÷ 4 equals 2. So, does that mean there will be 2 groups?

Wait a second, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes when problems mention groups, especially with different types of players, there might be more to it. But in this case, the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on the groups, like each group needing to have a certain number of new or returning players. It just says the coach put them into groups with 4 players in each group. So, I think it's just a straightforward division.

Let me double-check the total number of players again. 2 new plus 6 returning is definitely 8. Each group has 4 players, so 8 divided by 4 is 2. Yeah, that seems right.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe visualizing it. If I imagine 8 players, and I pair them up into groups of 4, how many pairs would I have? Well, 4 goes into 8 twice. So, two groups of 4 each. That makes sense.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when you have groups, if the numbers don't divide evenly, you have to have some groups with fewer people. But in this case, 4 divides evenly into 8, so no leftover players. So, all groups will have exactly 4 players. That means the number of groups is just the total number divided by the group size.

So, to recap: total players = 8, group size = 4, so number of groups = 8 ÷ 4 = 2. Yeah, that seems solid.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. The problem is pretty straightforward. It doesn't mention anything about different group sizes or any specific constraints on the groups, so it's just a simple division problem.

Another way to think about it: if each group has 4 players, how many groups can I form? With 8 players, I can form 2 groups. Each group will have 4 players, and all players will be accounted for. So, that's consistent.

I guess the key here is to recognize that this is a division problem where we're dividing the total number of players by the number of players per group. So, 8 ÷ 4 = 2 groups.

I don't see any alternative interpretations that would change this result. The problem is clear and doesn't introduce any complicating factors. So, I'm confident that the number of groups is 2.
</think>

The baseball team has a total of 8 players (2 new + 6 returning). Since each group consists of 4 players, the number of groups is calculated by dividing the total number of players by the number of players per group: 8 ÷ 4 = 2 groups.

" A painter needed to paint 6 rooms in a building. ; Each room takes 5 hours to paint. . If he . already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     A painter needed to paint 6 rooms in a building. ; Each room takes 5 hours to paint. . If he . already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest? 
                <think>
To determine how long the painter will take to paint the remaining rooms, I first identify the total number of rooms and the number of rooms already painted.

There are 6 rooms in total, and 2 rooms have already been painted. This means there are 6 minus 2, which equals 4 rooms left to paint.

Next, I calculate the total time required to paint all 6 rooms. Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the total time needed is 6 rooms multiplied by 5 hours per room, resulting in 30 hours.

Finally, I subtract the time already spent painting the 2 rooms from the total time needed. Since painting the 2 rooms took 2 rooms multiplied by 5 hours, which is 10 hours, the remaining time is 30 hours minus 10 hours, totaling 20 hours.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Total Rooms to Paint:**  
   There are **6 rooms** in total.

2. **Rooms Already Painted:**  
   The painter has already painted **2 rooms**.

3. **Remaining Rooms to Paint:**  
   \[
   \text{Remaining rooms} = \text{Total rooms} - \text{Already painted rooms} = 6 - 2 = 4
   \]

4. **Time to Paint All Remaining Rooms:**  
   Each room takes **5 hours** to paint. Therefore, the time needed to paint the remaining **4 rooms** is:
   \[
   4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ hours/room} = 20 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**  
   The painter will take **20 hours** longer to paint the remaining rooms.

                 {The final answer is}
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
A waiter had 22 customers in his section. If 14 of them left and the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table, how many tables did he have?

**Step 1: Understand the Given Information**

- **Total customers initially:** 22
- **Customers who left:** 14
- **Customers remaining after some left:** Total customers - Customers who left = 22 - 14 = 8

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Tables**

- Each table has **4 people** after the customers left.
- **Customers remaining:** 8
- **Number of tables:** Customers per table = Number of tables

To find the number of tables, we can use the formula:

                    question:
                     Roger had 120 pieces of clothing to wash. He put ! 48 of them in ! one load, but decided to ? split the rest into 9 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing : could go in each of the small loads? 
                <think>
First, I need to determine how many pieces of clothing Roger has in total, which is 120.

He uses one load of 48 pieces of clothing, leaving 120 minus 48, which equals 72 pieces remaining.

Next, he decides to split the remaining 72 pieces into 9 equal loads. To find out how many pieces go into each small load, I divide the remaining pieces by the number of loads: 72 divided by 9 equals 8.

Therefore, each small load can have 8 pieces of clothing.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Total Pieces of Clothing:** Roger has a total of 120 pieces of clothing to wash.

2. **First Load:** He puts 48 pieces of clothing in the first load.

3. **Remaining Pieces:** Subtract the first load from the total:
   \[
   120 - 48 = 72 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Splitting Remaining Pieces:** Roger decides to split the remaining 72 pieces into 9 equal loads.

5. **Calculating Pieces per Small Load:**
   \[
   \frac{72}{9} = 8 \text{ pieces per load}
   \]

**Answer:** Each small load can contain \(\boxed{8}\) pieces of clothing.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",8

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     ? In . fourth grade there were 10 students : at the start of the year. During the year 4 students left and 42 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end? 
                 {Okay, so I have this problem here about fourth-grade students. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that at the start of the year, there were 10 students in fourth grade. Then, during the year, 4 students left, and 42 new students came to school. I need to find out how many students were in fourth grade at the end of the year. 

Alright, let me break it down. First, we start with 10 students. That's clear. Then, during the year, some changes happen: 4 leave, and 42 come in. So, I think I need to calculate the number of students after these changes. 

Wait, let me make sure I understand. When they say 4 students left, does that mean they were part of the original 10? Or are they separate? Hmm, I think they are part of the original 10 because it says 4 left, and 42 came. So, the 4 leaving are subtracted from the original, and then we add the 42 new ones. 

So, mathematically, it would be 10 (original) minus 4 (leaving) plus 42 (new). Let me write that out: 10 - 4 + 42. Hmm, let me compute that. 10 minus 4 is 6, and then 6 plus 42 is 48. So, does that mean there are 48 students at the end of the year? 

Wait, let me think again. If 4 leave, we subtract them, and then add 42. So yes, that seems right. 10 - 4 is 6, and adding 42 makes 48. So, the total number of students at the end would be 48. 

Is there another way to look at it? Maybe by considering the net change. The number of students who left is 4, and the number of new students is 42. So, the net increase would be 42 - 4, which is 38. Then, adding that to the original 10 gives 10 + 38 = 48. Yep, same result. 

So, both methods lead me to 48. That seems consistent. I don't think I made a mistake in the calculations. 10 minus 4 is definitely 6, and adding 42 to that gives 48. Alternatively, the net change is 42 new minus 4 leaving, which is 38, and 10 plus 38 is 48. Either way, the answer is 48. 

I guess another way to visualize it is to imagine the classroom. Starting with 10 students. Then, 4 leave, so we have 6 left. Then, 42 come in, so we add 42 to the 6, making 48. Yeah, that makes sense. 

I don't think I'm missing anything here. The problem is pretty straightforward. It's just about tracking the changes in the number of students. So, subtract the leavers and add the newcomers to the initial number. 

Wait, just to make sure, is there a possibility that the 42 new students are replacing the 4 who left? Like, maybe the 42 are in addition, but the 4 are subtracted. So, total would be 10 - 4 + 42, which is definitely 48. Yeah, that's correct. 

Alternatively, if it was 42 minus 4, that would be a net change of 38, but no, because 42 are new students, they are separate from the ones who left. So, the total number is original minus those who left, plus those who came. So, 10 - 4 is 6, plus 42 is 48. 

I think I've got it. So, the answer is 48 students at the end of the year.
</think>

The number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year is calculated by starting with 10 students, subtracting the 4 who left, and adding the 42 new students.

{The final answer is 48.}

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Start with the initial number of students:**
   - At the beginning of the year, there are 10 fourth-grade students.

2. **Calculate the number of students who left:**
   - 4 students left during the year.

3. **Calculate the number of new students who arrived:**
   - 42 new students came to school.

4. **Compute the net change in the number of students:**
   - Net change = Number of new students - Number of students who left
   - Net change = 42 - 4 = 38

5. **Add the net change to the initial number of",48

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
First, there are 14 books that need to be shelved.

The librarian takes 2 of these books, leaving Roger with 14 minus 2, which is 12 books.

Roger can place 3 books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves he needs, I divide the total number of books by the number of books he can place on each shelf.

So, 12 books divided by 3 books per shelf equals 4 shelves.

Therefore, Roger will need 4 shelves.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Total Number of Books:**  
   Roger has a total of 14 books to put away.

2. **Books Taken by the Librarian:**  
   The librarian takes 2 books, leaving Roger with:  
   \( 14 - 2 = 12 \) books.

3. **Books per Shelf:**  
   Roger can fit 3 books on each shelf.

4. **Calculating the Number of Shelves Needed:**  
   To find out how many shelves Roger needs, divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books he can place on each shelf:

</think><think>
I need to determine how many extra flowers Bianca picked beyond what she used.

First, Bianca picked a total of 39 tulips and 49 roses, which means she picked 39 + 49 = 88 flowers in total.

She used 81 of these flowers to make bouquets. To find out how many extra flowers she picked, I subtract the number of flowers used from the total number of flowers picked: 88 - 81 = 7.

Therefore, Bianca picked 7 extra flowers.

                 {Wait, this seems like a problem with missing punctuation. Let me try to parse it. It says: Dave had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 20 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? Hmm. So, the problem is that Dave had a total of 9 + 27 shirts to wash, which is 36 shirts. He washed 20 of them, so the number he didn't wash would be 36 minus 20, which is 16. So the answer is 16. But wait, the way the problem is phrased, it says ""he had only washed 20 of them,"" which might imply that he didn't finish washing all. So maybe he didn't wash all of them.

                    question:
                     While on vacation, Haley , took 50 pictures at the zoo and 8 at the museum. If she . later deleted 38 of the pictures, how many pictures from her vacation ! did she still have? 
                 Okay, so I need to figure out how many pictures Haley still has after deleting some. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, Haley took pictures at two places: the zoo and the museum. She took 50 pictures at the zoo and 8 at the museum. So, the total number of pictures she took initially is 50 plus 8. Let me add those together: 50 + 8 equals 58. So, she had 58 pictures in total before deleting any.

Now, she later deleted 38 pictures. I need to subtract these deleted pictures from the total she had. So, 58 minus 38. Hmm, let me do that math. 58 minus 38 is... let's see, 58 minus 30 is 28, and then minus 8 more is 20. So, 58 - 38 equals 20. That means she has 20 pictures left.

Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. If I have 58 and take away 38, breaking it down: 58 minus 20 is 38, and then I still have 38 minus 38, which is 0. Wait, that doesn't make sense because earlier I thought it was 20. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait no, that can't be right. If I take away 38 from 58, I should have 20 left, because 38 plus 20 is 58. So, yeah, 58 minus 38 is 20. I think I confused myself earlier. So, the correct number is 20 pictures remaining.

I guess another way to look at it is: if I have 58 pictures and delete 38, I'm left with 58 - 38 = 20. That makes sense because 38 is less than 58, so there are still some pictures left. So, 20 is the right answer.

Just to be thorough, let me visualize it. Imagine she has 58 pictures. She deletes 38, which is like removing 38 items from a pile. So, 58 minus 38 is like 20 left. Yeah, that checks out.

So, after deleting 38 pictures, Haley still has 20 pictures from her vacation.
</think>

Haley initially took 58 pictures (50 at the zoo and 8 at the museum). She later deleted 38 of them. To find out how many pictures she still has, subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures she took.

58 total pictures - 38 deleted pictures = 20 remaining pictures.

                    question:
                     For a birthday party Cody bought 4 regular , sodas and 44 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 6 on each shelf, how ? many shelves would ? he fill up? 
                 Cody's problem is to figure out how many shelves he would fill in his fridge with the sodas he bought. He has 4 regular and 44 diet sodas. His fridge can hold 6 on each shelf. So, the first step is to calculate the total number of sodas he has, which is 4 + 44 = 48. Now, he needs to figure out how many shelves he needs to fill to hold all 48 sodas, given that each shelf can hold up to 6 sodas. So, he can divide the total number by the number each shelf can hold: 48 ÷ 6 = 8. So, he needs 8 shelves.

Wait, but hold on a second. The problem says that Cody bought 4 regular and 44 diet sodas. So, that's 48 total. Each shelf can hold 6 sodas, so 48 divided by 6 is 8. So, he needs 8 shelves. That seems straightforward. But let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem.

Maybe the question is trying to trick me by considering different types of sodas? Like, perhaps regular and diet sodas can't be mixed on the same shelf? Or maybe they have different sizes, but the problem doesn't specify. It just says he bought 4 regular and 44 diet, so total 48. Each shelf holds 6. So, regardless of the type, each shelf can take 6 sodas, whether they're regular or diet. So, the total number of shelves is 48 / 6 = 8.

Is there a possibility that the fridge has a limited number of shelves? The problem says Cody's fridge would only hold 6 on each shelf. So, each shelf can hold 6 sodas. So, he needs to fill as many shelves as needed to hold all 48. So, 8 shelves.

But wait, perhaps the fridge has a maximum number of shelves? Like, maybe the fridge can only hold a certain number of shelves, but the problem doesn't specify. It just says each shelf can hold 6 on each shelf. So, the number of shelves is determined by the total number of sodas divided by the capacity per shelf.

So, 48 divided by 6 is 8. So, he needs 8 shelves.

I don't think there's any trick here. It's a straightforward division problem. Total sodas: 4 + 44 = 48. Each shelf holds 6, so 48 / 6 = 8 shelves.

Therefore, the answer is 8.
</think>

Cody has a total of 48 sodas (4 regular + 44 diet). Each shelf can hold up to 6 sodas. To find out how many shelves he needs, divide the total number of sodas by the number each shelf can hold.

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Therefore, Cody needs 8 shelves to store all his sodas.

</think><think>
To determine how many groups of 9 can be formed from the debate team, I first calculate the total number of students. There are 26 boys and 46 girls, making a total of 72 students.

Next, I find out how many groups of 9 can be formed by dividing the total number of students by the size of each group. Dividing 72 by 9 gives 8.

Therefore, the debate team can form 8 groups.
</think>

Let's determine how many groups of 9 can be formed from the debate team.

**Given:**
- **Boys:** 26
- **Girls:** 46
- **Total Students:** \(26 + 46 = 72\)

**Step 1:** Determine the total number of students.

\[
\text{Total Students} = 26 \text{ (boys)} + 46 \text{ (girls)} = 72
\]

**Step 2:** Calculate how many groups of 9 can be formed from the total number of students.

\[
\text{Number of Groups} = \frac{\text{Total Students}}{\text{Size of Each Group}} = \frac{72}{9} = 8
\]

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total red apples ordered = 6
- Total green apples ordered = 15
- Number of students wanting fruit = 5

**Step 1:** Determine the total number of apples ordered.
Total apples = Red apples + Green apples
Total apples = 6 + 15
Total apples = 21

**Step 2:** Calculate the number of apples needed for 5 students.
Each student wants 1 apple.
Apples needed for 5 students = 5

**Step 3:** Find the difference between the total apples ordered and the apples needed.

                     At a company picnic 9 managers and 15 employees decided to start . a game of volleyball. If : they split into 8 teams how many people would be on each ? team? 
                 {Let me see, so we have 9 managers and 15 employees who want to play volleyball. They split into 8 teams. I need to find out how many people would be on each team. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, let me figure out the total number of people. There are 9 managers plus 15 employees. So that's 9 plus 15, which is 24 people in total. Okay, so 24 people want to play volleyball.

Now, they split into 8 teams. Wait, 8 teams from 24 people. I need to find out how many people per team. Let me think. If they have 8 teams, how do we divide 24 by 8?

Well, 24 divided by 8 is 3. So does that mean 3 people per team? That seems straightforward, but wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here.

Wait, could it be that the teams are not all the same size? Maybe some teams have more people than others? But the problem doesn't specify that the teams are uneven. It just says they split into 8 teams. So, I think it's safe to assume that each team has the same number of people.

So, if I have 24 people and 8 teams, dividing 24 by 8 gives me 3. So, each team would have 3 people. Is there another way to think about this?

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as distributing the people equally. Since there are 24 people, and 8 teams, each team gets 24 divided by 8, which is 3. Yeah, that makes sense.

I don't see any other factors here. There's no mention of different roles or anything that would require varying team sizes. So, I think it's just a straightforward division problem.

Therefore, the number of people on each team would be 3.}
</think>

To determine how many people are on each team when 9 managers and 15 employees split into 8 teams, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of participants:**
   - Managers: 9
   - Employees: 15
   - Total = 9 + 15 = 24 people.

2. **Divide the total number of participants by the number of teams:**
   - 24 people ÷ 8 teams = 3 people per team.

                    question:
                     Mike made 42 dollars mowing lawns over the : summer. If he spent 10 dollars buying new mower blades, ? how many 8 dollar games could he buy . with the money he had left? 
                 {Okay, so Mike made $42 from mowing lawns over the summer. He spent $10 on buying new mower blades. Now, I need to figure out how many $8 games he could buy with the money he has left. Let me break this down step by step.}

First, I'll calculate how much money Mike has left after buying the mower blades. He started with $42 and spent $10, so I subtract 10 from 42. That gives me 42 minus 10 equals 32. So, Mike has $32 left.

Now, I need to determine how many $8 games he can purchase with the remaining $32. To find this, I'll divide the amount he has left by the cost per game. So, 32 divided by 8 equals 4. That means Mike can buy 4 games with the money he has left.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with $42, subtracting $10 gives $32. Then, dividing $32 by $8 gives 4. Yep, that seems correct. So, Mike can buy 4 games.
</think>

Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Mike made \$42 from mowing lawns over the summer. He spent \$10 on buying new mower blades. How many \$8 games could he buy with the money he had left?

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the remaining money after buying mower blades:**
   
   Mike earned \$42 and spent \$10 on mower blades.
   
   \[
   \$42 - \$10 = \$32
   \]
   
   So, Mike has \$32 left.

2. **Determine how many \$8 games can be bought with \$32:**
   
   To find out how many games Mike can buy, divide the remaining money by the cost per game.
   
   \[
   \$32 \div \$8 = 4
   \]
   
   Therefore, Mike can buy **4** games.

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
I need to determine how long it will take the chef to cook the remaining potatoes.

First, I'll calculate the total number of potatoes that need to be cooked. There are 13 potatoes in total, and 5 have already been cooked. So, the number of potatoes left to cook is 13 minus 5, which equals 8 potatoes.

Next, I'll find out the total cooking time required for all 13 potatoes. Since each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, the total cooking time for 13 potatoes is 13 multiplied by 6, resulting in 78 minutes.

Then, I'll subtract the time already spent on the 5 cooked potatoes. The time spent is 5 multiplied by 6, which equals 30 minutes.

Finally, I'll subtract the time already spent from the total required time to find out how much longer it will take the chef to cook the remaining potatoes. So, 78 minutes minus 30 minutes equals 48 minutes.

Therefore, it will take the chef 48 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total potatoes to cook: 13
- Potatoes already cooked: 5
- Time to cook one potato: 6 minutes

**Step 1:** Determine the number of potatoes remaining to cook.
\[
\text{Remaining potatoes} = \text{Total potatoes} - \text{Already cooked} = 13 - 5 = 8
\]

**Step 2:** Calculate the total cooking time required for all 13 potatoes.
\[
\text{Total cooking time} = \text{Number of potatoes} \times \text{Time per potato} = 13 \times 6 = 78 \text{ minutes}

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     ! Robin ! was making baggies of cookies with 6 cookies in each bag. If she had 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies, how ; many baggies could she make? 
                 Alright, so Robin has these cookies she wants to bag up. She has two types: chocolate chip and oatmeal. Let me see... She makes baggies with 6 cookies each. She has 23 chocolate chip and 25 oatmeal cookies. The question is, how many baggies can she make?

Okay, so first off, she needs to figure out how to combine these cookies into bags of 6. Now, the challenge here is that she has two different types of cookies, and I guess she can't mix them because maybe the oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies don't go together? Or maybe she can, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. Wait, the problem doesn't say anything about mixing, so maybe she can only make baggies with one type of cookie at a time. So she has to decide whether to make chocolate chip baggies or oatmeal ones.

So she has 23 chocolate chip cookies. Each bag holds 6. How many bags can she make with just the chocolate chip cookies? Let's see, 23 divided by 6. Hmm, 6 times 3 is 18, and 6 times 4 is 24. So she can make 3 full bags of chocolate chip cookies, because 18 cookies fit into 3 bags, and then she has 5 left over. So 3 bags, and 5 leftover chocolate chip cookies.

Now, she also has 25 oatmeal cookies. Similarly, 25 divided by 6. 6 times 4 is 24, so she can make 4 bags of oatmeal cookies, with 1 leftover. So 4 bags, and 1 leftover oatmeal cookie.

But she can't mix the two, right? Because the problem doesn't specify she can mix, so maybe she has to use each type separately. So she has 3 bags from chocolate chip and 4 bags from oatmeal, so total 7 bags.

Wait, but maybe she can mix them? Let me think. If she can mix, then the total number of cookies is 23 + 25, which is 48. Then, 48 divided by 6 is 8. So she can make 8 bags. But wait, the problem doesn't specify whether she can mix or not. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says ""baggies of cookies with 6 cookies in each bag."" It doesn't specify that she has to use only one type of cookie per bag. So maybe she can mix them. But the problem is, maybe she can't, because maybe she doesn't want to mix chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies. So, the answer could vary depending on that.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's implied that she can only make baggies with one type of cookie at a time. Because otherwise, if she can mix, then the answer would be 8. But the problem doesn't specify, so I might need to consider both possibilities.

Wait, but the problem is from a math problem, so maybe it's just a straightforward division. Let me check the problem again: ""Robin was making baggies of cookies with 6 cookies in each bag. If she had 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make?"" So it's about making baggies, each with 6 cookies, and she has these two types. It doesn't specify that she can't mix. So maybe she can mix.

So if she can mix, the total cookies are 23 + 25 = 48, and 48 divided by 6 is exactly 8, so she can make 8 baggies. So the answer would be 8. But if she can't mix, then she can make 3 (chocolate chip) + 4 (oatmeal) = 7 baggies.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I should assume she can't mix because she has two types. Maybe she can only make baggies of one type. So 3 + 4 = 7. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to go with the assumption that she can mix, because otherwise, the problem would probably specify that she can't.

Wait, but sometimes in math problems, when you have two different items, you can only make bags of one type. So perhaps the answer is 7. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. Let me check the problem: ""Robin was making baggies of cookies with 6 cookies in each bag. If she had 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make?"" So she's making baggies, each of 6 cookies. She has two types. So maybe she can make baggies with any combination, but perhaps she can't mix. So maybe she can't make",8

                 Okay, so I have this problem where Wendy uploaded a bunch of pictures to Facebook. She has two different types of pictures: ones from her phone and ones from her camera. Specifically, she uploaded 22 factorial pictures from her phone and 2 from her camera. Then she sorted all these pictures into 4 different albums, and each album has the same number of pictures. I need to figure out how many pictures were in each album.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. So, Wendy has two sources: phone and camera. From her phone, she uploaded 22!, which is a huge number, right? Because factorial grows really quickly. And from her camera, only 2 pictures. So in total, how many pictures does she have?

Wait, the problem says she uploaded 22! pictures from her phone and 2 from her camera. So total pictures would be 22! + 2. Then she sorted all these into 4 different albums, each with the same number of pictures. So each album has the same number, say, n pictures. Therefore, the total number of albums multiplied by the number per album should equal the total number of pictures.

So, 4n = 22! + 2. Therefore, n = (22! + 2)/4. But n has to be an integer because you can't have a fraction of a picture in an album. So, (22! + 2) must be divisible by 4.

Let me check if 22! is divisible by 4. Well, 22! is the product of numbers from 1 to 22. In that range, there are plenty of even numbers, and in fact, multiples of 4 as well. So 22! is definitely divisible by 4. What about 2? 2 is obviously divisible by 4? No, 2 divided by 4 is 0.5, which isn't an integer. So 22! is divisible by 4, but 2 is not. So when you add them together, 22! + 2, the total will be 22! (which is divisible by 4) plus 2, which is 2 more than a multiple of 4.

So, 22! is divisible by 4, so 22! = 4k for some integer k. Then 22! + 2 = 4k + 2. So 4k + 2 divided by 4 is k + 0.5, which is not an integer. Wait, that can't be, because the total number of pictures is 22! + 2, which needs to be divisible by 4 to have equal albums. But 22! + 2 is 2 more than a multiple of 4, so it's not divisible by 4. That suggests a problem.

Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again. It says she uploaded 22! pictures from her phone and 2 from her camera. So total is 22! + 2. Then she sorted all the pics into 4 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album. So 4n = 22! + 2. So n = (22! + 2)/4. But since n must be an integer, 22! + 2 must be divisible by 4. But as I saw earlier, 22! is divisible by 4, so 22! + 2 ≡ 2 mod 4, which is not zero. So that would mean n is not an integer, which is impossible because you can't have half a picture in an album.

Hmm, that suggests that there might be a mistake in the problem or my understanding. Wait, maybe the problem is written differently. Let me check again: ""Wendy uploaded 22 ! pictures from her phone and 2 ; from her camera to facebook."" So the 22! is from phone, and 2; from camera. Maybe the semicolon is indicating something else, like two separate statements. So perhaps it's 22! from phone and 2 from camera, with the 2 being in a separate category, maybe? Or maybe the 2 is also factorial? Wait, no, because the 2 is just 2, not a factorial.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 22! and 2 are both being added together, and then divided by 4. So, if 22! + 2 is not divisible by 4, then it's impossible. But that can't be, because the problem says she did it. So maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let me think again. 22! is divisible by 4 because it includes factors of 2 and 4. So 22! is 4",6

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Katie has 8 pieces of candy.
- Her sister has 23 pieces of candy.
- They combined the candies before eating.

**Total candies before eating:**
\[
8 \, (\text{Katie's candies}) + 23 \, (\text{sister's candies}) = 31 \, \text{pieces}
\]

**They ate 8 pieces the first night.**

**Candies left after eating:**

                    question:
                     A pet store had 88 puppies. In one day they sold 34 of them and put ? the ! rest into cages with 6 in each ; cage. How many cages did they use? 
                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
To determine the number of cages needed, I first calculate how many puppies remain after selling 34.

88 puppies minus 34 sold equals 54 puppies left.

Next, I divide the remaining 54 puppies by the number of puppies per cage, which is 6.

54 divided by 6 equals 9 cages.

Therefore, the pet store used 9 cages.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total puppies = 88
- Puppies sold in one day = 34
- Puppies remaining = ?

**Step 1: Calculate the number of puppies remaining.**
\[
\text{Puppies remaining} = \text{Total puppies} - \text{Puppies sold} = 88 - 34 = 54
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of cages needed.**
Each cage holds **6** puppies. To find out how many cages are needed for the remaining puppies, divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage.
\[
\text{Number of cages} = \frac{\text{Puppies remaining}}{\text{Puppies per cage}} = \frac{54}{6} = 9
\]

**Final Answer:**

</think><think>
Jerry can carry a maximum of 8 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another. 

First, he will make a trip to the first table. Since he can carry 8 trays, he will take 8 trays from the first table, leaving 1 tray remaining there. He will then make a trip to the second table, taking all 7 trays. 

Now, he has 8 - 8 = 0 trays from the first table and 7 - 7 = 0 trays from the second table. 

He will need to make another trip to the first table to carry the remaining 1 tray. 

So, in total, Jerry makes 3 trips.
</think>

Let's determine the number of trips Jerry needs to make step by step.

1. **Initial Trip to Table 1:**
   - **Trays to Pick Up:** 9
   - **Trays Jerry Can Carry:** 8
   - **Trays Picked Up:** 8 (leaving 1 tray at Table 1)
   - **Trays Picked Up from Table 2:** 7 (since he can't return immediately)

2. **Second Trip:**
   - **Trays Picked Up from Table 1:** 0 (all 8 trays carried in the first trip)
   - **Trays Picked Up from Table 2:** 0 (all 7 trays carried in the second trip)

3. **Third Trip to Table 1:**

                 {Wait, the original question seems incomplete. It ends with ""how many . groups would there be?"" with a period. Maybe a typo? Perhaps it was meant to be ""how many groups would there be?""} 

Hmm, let me try to parse this question properly. It says: There school's baseball team had 12 new players and 44 returning players. If the coach put them into ? groups with 8 players in each group, how many groups would there be? 

Wait, the original question has a period after ""groups"" so it was probably a typo. So, the question is: The baseball team had 12 new players and 44 returning players. If the coach put them into groups with 8 players in each group, how many groups would there be?

Okay, so first, let me figure out the total number of players. There are 12 new players and 44 returning players. So, total players = 12 + 44 = 56 players.

Now, the coach is putting them into groups, each with 8 players. So, we need to find how many such groups are needed to accommodate all 56 players.

To find the number of groups, we can divide the total number of players by the number of players per group. So, number of groups = total players / players per group.

Let me compute that. 56 divided by 8 equals... Well, 8 times 7 is 56, so 56 divided by 8 is 7.

Therefore, the coach would need 7 groups.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. 12 plus 44 is indeed 56. 56 divided by 8 is 7. Yep, that seems right. So, the number of groups is 7.
</think>

The baseball team has a total of 56 players (12 new + 44 returning). Dividing the total number of players by the number of players per group (8) gives 56 ÷ 8 = 7 groups.

                 {I need to figure out how much money Will has left after buying the mower blades and then determine how many $9 games he can purchase with that amount.}

Okay, so Will made $104 over the summer from mowing lawns. Then he spent $41 on buying new mower blades. I need to find out how much money he has left after this purchase and then see how many $9 games he can buy with the remaining amount.

First, let me subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings to find out how much he has left. So, $104 minus $41. Hmm, what's 104 minus 41? Let me do the subtraction step by step. 104 minus 40 is 64, and then minus 1 more is 63. So, he has $63 left.

Now, he wants to buy as many $9 games as possible with this $63. I need to figure out how many times $9 fits into $63. So, I can divide 63 by 9 to find out the number of games he can buy.

Calculating that, 9 goes into 63 how many times? Well, 9 times 7 is 63, so he can buy 7 games. Wait, let me check that again. 9 multiplied by 7 is indeed 63, so yes, 7 games.

Therefore, Will can buy 7 $9 games with his remaining money.
</think>

Will made $104 from mowing lawns and spent $41 on mower blades. To find out how much money he has left, subtract the amount spent from his total earnings:

\[
104 - 41 = 63 \, \text{dollars}
\]

With the $63 remaining, he wants to buy as many $9 games as possible. To determine how many games he can purchase, divide the remaining amount by the cost per game:

                    question:
                     Sam ; was collecting cans for recycling. . On Saturday he filled 3 bags up and on Sunday he filled 4 more bags. If ! each bag had 9 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total? 
                 Okay, so Sam collected cans over the weekend. He filled 3 bags on Saturday and 4 more on Sunday. Each bag has 9 cans. I need to find the total number of cans he picked up.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, on Saturday, he filled 3 bags. Each bag has 9 cans. So, to find out how many cans he put into the bags on Saturday, I can multiply the number of bags by the number of cans per bag.

So, 3 bags multiplied by 9 cans per bag. Let me calculate that: 3 times 9 is 27. So, he put 27 cans into the bags on Saturday.

Now, on Sunday, he filled 4 more bags. Each bag still has 9 cans. So, similar to Saturday, I need to multiply the number of bags by the number of cans per bag for Sunday.

That would be 4 bags times 9 cans per bag. Let me do that multiplication: 4 times 9 is 36. So, he put 36 cans into the bags on Sunday.

Now, to find the total number of cans he picked up, I need to add the cans from Saturday and Sunday together. So, 27 cans from Saturday plus 36 cans from Sunday.

Let me add those together: 27 plus 36. Hmm, 20 plus 30 is 50, and 7 plus 6 is 13, so 50 plus 13 is 63. So, 27 plus 36 equals 63.

Therefore, Sam picked up a total of 63 cans.

Wait, let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3 times 9 is definitely 27, and 4 times 9 is 36. Adding those gives 63. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I missed anything in the problem. It says he filled 3 bags on Saturday and 4 more on Sunday, each with 9 cans. So, yeah, 3 times 9 plus 4 times 9 equals 63 total cans.
</think>

Sam collected cans over the weekend. On Saturday, he filled 3 bags, each containing 9 cans, totaling 27 cans. On Sunday, he filled 4 bags, each also containing 9 cans, totaling 36 cans. Adding these together, he picked up a total of 63 cans.

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
First, determine the total number of problems on each worksheet. Since there are 4 problems per worksheet, each worksheet contains 4 problems.

Next, calculate the total number of problems the teacher has to grade. If there are 16 worksheets and each has 4 problems, the total number of problems is 16 multiplied by 4, which equals 64 problems.

Then, identify how many problems the teacher has already graded. It is stated that the teacher has already graded 8 worksheets. Since each worksheet has 4 problems, the number of problems already graded is 8 multiplied by 4, resulting in 32 problems.

Finally, subtract the number of already graded problems from the total number of problems to find out how many more problems the teacher needs to grade. This is 64 total problems minus 32 already graded, which equals 32 remaining problems.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Number of Problems:**
   - Each worksheet has **4** problems.
   - The teacher has **16** worksheets.
   - **Total problems to grade = Number of worksheets × Problems per worksheet**
   - **Total problems = 16 × 4 = 64**

2. **Already Graded Problems:**
   - The teacher has already graded **8** worksheets.
   - **Already graded problems = Number of graded worksheets × Problems per worksheet**
   - **Already graded problems = 8 × 4 = 32**

                     Paige was unboxing some of : her old winter clothes. She found 6 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 5 scarves and 5 mittens. ! How many ? pieces of winter clothing did Paige have total? 
                 {The final answer is}
</think>

Let's determine the total number of winter clothing pieces Paige has.

**Step 1: Determine the number of scarves.**
- Each box contains 5 scarves.
- There are 6 boxes.
- Total scarves = 5 scarves/box × 6 boxes = 30 scarves.

**Step 2: Determine the number of mittens.**
- Each box contains 5 mittens.
- There are 6 boxes.
- Total mittens = 5 mittens/box × 6 boxes = 30 mittens.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of clothing pieces.**
- Total scarves + Total mittens = 30 + 30 = 60 pieces.

**Final Answer:** {The final answer is} 60.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",60

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
To determine how long it will take the chef to cook the remaining potatoes, I first need to identify the total number of potatoes that need to be cooked and the current number that are already cooked.

There are 12 potatoes in total, and 6 of them are already cooked. This means there are 12 - 6 = 6 potatoes left to cook.

Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook. Therefore, the total cooking time required for the remaining 6 potatoes is 6 potatoes multiplied by 6 minutes per potato, which equals 36 minutes.

Finally, since the chef is cooking the remaining potatoes simultaneously, the total cooking time for the remaining potatoes is 36 minutes.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Total Potatoes to Cook:**
   - **Total potatoes** = 12

2. **Already Cooked Potatoes:**
   - **Already cooked** = 6

3. **Remaining Potatoes:**
   - **Remaining** = Total - Already Cooked
   - **Remaining** = 12 - 6 = 6

4. **Time per Potato:**
   - **Time per potato** = 6 minutes

5. **Total Time to Cook Remaining Potatoes:**
   - **Total time** = Number of Remaining Potatoes × Time per Potato
   - **Total time** = 6 × 6 = 36 minutes

**Final Answer:**  
It will take the chef \(\boxed{36}\) minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",36

                 {The final answer is}
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Luke started with 57 games. He sold 39 of them. He packed the remaining games, putting 2 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use?

**Solution:**

1. **Total Games Initially:**
   - Luke started with **57** games.

2. **Games Sold:**
   - He sold **39** games.

3. **Games Remaining:**
   - Subtract the games sold from the total games:
     \[
     57 - 39 = 18
     \]
   - So, **18** games remain.

4. **Games per Box:**
   - He packed the remaining games with **2** games in each box.

5. **Number of Boxes Needed:**
   - To find out how many boxes are needed, divide the remaining games by the number of games per box:
     \[
     \frac{18}{2} = 9

                    question:
                     April's discount flowers was ! having a sale where each flower was 3 dollars. ? If Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies, how much did she spend? 
                 Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much Emily spent at April's discount flowers. Let me see... The problem says that April's discount flowers had a sale where each flower was $3. So, that means every single flower, regardless of type, was priced at $3.

Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies. Hmm, wait a minute. Are roses and daisies different types of flowers? I think so. Roses are a type of flower, and daisies are another type. So, each rose costs $3, and each daisy costs $3 as well.

So, if Emily bought 2 roses, that would be 2 times $3. Let me write that down: 2 * $3. That equals $6. Okay, that's the cost for the roses.

Then, she also bought 2 daisies. Using the same logic, that's 2 times $3. So, 2 * $3 is also $6. Got that.

Now, to find out the total amount she spent, I need to add the cost of the roses and the cost of the daisies together. So, that's $6 for the roses plus $6 for the daisies. Let me add those up: $6 + $6.

Hmm, what's $6 plus $6? That's $12. So, does that mean Emily spent a total of $12?

Wait, just to double-check. Each flower is $3, regardless of type. So, two roses would be 2 * 3 = 6, and two daisies would be 2 * 3 = 6. Adding those together gives 6 + 6 = 12. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think there's any catch here. The problem doesn't mention any additional discounts or special offers beyond each flower being $3. So, it's straightforward multiplication and addition.

So, putting it all together: Emily bought 2 roses at $3 each, totaling $6, and 2 daisies at $3 each, also totaling $6. Therefore, her total expenditure is $12.
</think>

Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies, with each flower costing $3. The cost for the roses is 2 × $3 = $6, and the cost for the daisies is 2 × $3 = $6. Adding these together, the total amount Emily spent is $6 + $6 = $12.

                 {The final answer is}
</think>

To determine how many cages the pet store used, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Puppies:**
   - The store starts with **13 puppies**.

2. **Puppies Sold:**
   - They sold **7 puppies** in one day.

3. **Puppies Remaining:**
   - Subtract the number sold from the total:
     \[
     13 \text{ puppies} - 7 \text{ puppies} = 6 \text{ puppies remaining}
     \]

4. **Caging the Remaining Puppies:**
   - The remaining **6 puppies** are to be placed into cages with **2 puppies each**.

5. **Calculating the Number of Cages:**
   - Since each cage holds **2 puppies**, divide the remaining puppies by **2**:
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ puppies}}{2 \text{ puppies per cage}} = 3 \text{ cages}

                    question:
                     Faye and ? her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Faye picked . 23 and her mother picked 5. If only 12 of the carrots were good, how , many bad carrots did they have? 
                 Okay, so Faye and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Faye picked 23 carrots, and her mother picked 5. Then it says that only 12 of the carrots were good. The question is, how many bad carrots did they have?

Hmm, let me break this down. First, let me figure out the total number of carrots they picked together. Faye picked 23, and her mom picked 5, so together that's 23 plus 5. Let me do that addition: 23 + 5 is 28. So altogether, they picked 28 carrots.

Now, out of these 28 carrots, only 12 were good. That means the rest must be bad, right? So to find the number of bad carrots, I can subtract the number of good carrots from the total number picked. So that would be 28 minus 12. Let me calculate that: 28 minus 12 is 16. So, does that mean there are 16 bad carrots?

Wait, let me double-check. If Faye picked 23 and her mom picked 5, that's 28 total. 12 are good, so 28 minus 12 is indeed 16. That seems straightforward.

But just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me think about whether there's another way to approach this. Maybe considering how many each picked, but that doesn't seem necessary because the problem just gives the total number of good carrots and asks for the bad ones. So I don't need to know how many each individually picked or how many of each were good or bad. It's a straightforward subtraction problem.

So, total carrots: 23 + 5 = 28. Good carrots: 12. Bad carrots: 28 - 12 = 16. That makes sense. I don't think there's any trick here or anything I'm overlooking. The answer should be 16.
</think>

The total number of carrots picked by Faye and her mother is 23 + 5 = 28. Subtracting the 12 good carrots, we find there are 16 bad carrots.

                 {Isabel picked 66 flowers. She was making bouquets with 8 flowers each. 10 flowers wilted. How many bouquets could she still make?}
</think><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of flowers Isabel has after accounting for the 10 that wilted. She originally picked 66 flowers, so subtracting the 10 wilted ones leaves her with 56 usable flowers.

Next, I'll calculate how many bouquets she can make with the remaining 56 flowers. Each bouquet requires 8 flowers, so I'll divide the total number of usable flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet. 

56 flowers divided by 8 flowers per bouquet equals 7 bouquets. Therefore, Isabel can make 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of flowers after some wilted.**
- **Total flowers picked:** 66
- **Flowers that wilted:** 10
- **Remaining flowers:** \( 66 - 10 = 56 \)

                    question:
                     At the town carnival ; Oliver rode ! the ferris wheel 5 times and the bumper cars 4 times. If each ride ; cost 7 tickets, how many tickets did he use? 
                 Okay, so I have this problem here about Oliver at the town carnival. He rode the ferris wheel five times and the bumper cars four times. Each ride costs seven tickets. I need to figure out how many tickets he used in total. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should figure out how much each type of ride costs. The problem says each ride costs seven tickets. So, one ferris wheel ride is 7 tickets, and one bumper car ride is also 7 tickets. That part is straightforward.

Now, I need to find out how many rides he took in total. He went on the ferris wheel five times. So, that's 5 rides. And he also went on the bumper cars four times. So, that's 4 rides. To find the total number of rides, I should add these together. Let me write that down: 5 (ferris wheel) + 4 (bumper cars) = 9 rides in total.

Since each ride costs seven tickets, I can multiply the total number of rides by seven to find the total number of tickets used. So, 9 rides * 7 tickets per ride. Let me do that multiplication. 9 times 7 is 63. So, he used 63 tickets in total.

Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Five ferris wheel rides at seven tickets each: 5 * 7 = 35 tickets. Four bumper car rides: 4 * 7 = 28 tickets. Adding those together, 35 + 28 = 63 tickets. Yep, that's the same answer as before. So, I think that's correct.

I don't think there's any trick or hidden detail here. The problem seems pretty straightforward. It just requires calculating the total number of each ride and then adding them together since each ride costs the same amount.
</think>

To determine how many tickets Oliver used, calculate the total number of each ride and sum them.

1. Ferris wheel rides: 5 * 7 = 35 tickets.
2. Bumper car rides: 4 * 7 = 28 tickets.
3. Total tickets: 35 + 28 = 63 tickets.

First, I need to determine the total number of furniture pieces Wendy purchased. She bought 4 chairs and 4 tables, which makes a total of 8 furniture items.

Next, I'll calculate the total time spent assembling each piece. Since she spent 6 minutes on each chair and 6 minutes on each table, I'll multiply the number of chairs by 6 and the number of tables by 6. 

For the chairs: 4 chairs × 6 minutes per chair = 24 minutes.
For the tables: 4 tables × 6 minutes per table = 24 minutes.

Finally, I'll add the time spent on chairs and tables to find the total assembly time. 
24 minutes (chairs) + 24 minutes (tables) = 48 minutes.

Therefore, it took Wendy a total of 48 minutes to finish assembling all the furniture.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of furniture pieces:**
   - Chairs: 4

                 {I need to find out how many good games Ned ended up with. Let's see...}

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many good games Ned ended up with. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Ned bought 50 games from a friend and 27 more at a garage sale. So, in total, he bought 50 + 27 games. Let me add those up. 50 plus 27 is... 77 games in total.

Now, it mentions that 74 of the games didn't work. Hmm, so out of all the games he bought, 74 are broken. That means the remaining games are working, right? So to find out how many good games he has, I need to subtract the number of broken games from the total he bought.

So, total games: 77. Broken games: 74. If I subtract the broken ones from the total, 77 minus 74, that should give me the number of good games. Let me do that subtraction. 77 minus 74 is 3. So, does that mean he has 3 good games?

Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The problem says he bought 50 from a friend and 27 from a garage sale. Are there any details about whether some games from the friend worked or not? The problem doesn't specify, so I assume that all 50 from the friend might not have worked or maybe some did. But the problem says 74 didn't work in total, so I need to consider that.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says, ""He bought 50 games from a friend and bought 27 more at a garage sale. If 74 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with?"" So, the 74 broken games are across both purchases. So, of the total 77 games, 74 didn't work, meaning 3 worked. So, the answer should be 3.

Wait another thought: is there a chance that the games from the friend and the garage sale have different numbers of broken games? But the problem doesn't specify that. So, we can't assume that. It just says 74 of the games didn't work in total. So, regardless of where they came from, 74 are broken, so 3 are good.

Therefore, I think the answer is 3 good games.
</think>

Ned bought a total of 50 + 27 = 77 games. Out of these, 74 didn't work. To find the number of good games, subtract the broken games from the total: 77 - 74 = 3.

 A pet store had 38 siamese cats : and 25 house cats. During a sale ? they sold 45 cats. How many cats do they have left? ,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     A pet store had 38 siamese cats : and 25 house cats. During a sale ? they sold 45 cats. How many cats do they have left? 
                 Okay, so I need to figure out how many cats are left after the sale. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the pet store has two types of cats: Siamese cats and house cats. The numbers given are 38 Siamese cats and 25 house cats. So, before the sale, the total number of cats would be 38 plus 25, which is 63 cats.

Now, during a sale, they sold 45 cats in total. The question is, how many are left? Well, to find out how many are left, I need to subtract the number sold from the total number of cats.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify how many of each type were sold. Hmm. So, I might have to make an assumption here. Maybe all 45 cats sold were a mix of Siamese and house cats, but I don't know the exact numbers sold of each type.

Alternatively, perhaps the store sold all the cats, but that doesn't make sense because 38 plus 25 is 63, and they sold 45, so 63 minus 45 would leave 18. But that might not be the case because they might have sold a combination of both types.

Wait, maybe I should consider the worst case scenario. If they sold as many as possible of one type, leaving the other type untouched. For instance, if they sold all 38 Siamese cats, then they would have sold 38, and the remaining 45 minus 38 is 7 house cats sold. So, house cats left would be 25 minus 7, which is 18. Then, total cats left would be 18 house cats plus 0 Siamese cats, totaling 18.

Alternatively, if they sold all 25 house cats first, then they would have sold 25, leaving 45 minus 25, which is 20 Siamese cats sold. So, Siamese cats left would be 38 minus 20, which is 18. Then, total cats left would be 18 Siamese cats plus 0 house cats, again 18.

Wait, that's interesting. In both cases, whether they sold more Siamese or more house cats, the total number left is 18. So, regardless of the mix, the total number of cats left is 18.

So, perhaps the answer is 18 cats left. But I should make sure I'm not missing anything here.

Let me think differently. Maybe the 45 cats sold were a combination of both types. So, let's denote the number of Siamese cats sold as x and the number of house cats sold as y. So, x plus y equals 45. The remaining Siamese cats would be 38 minus x, and the remaining house cats would be 25 minus y.

But since I don't know x and y, I can't directly compute the total remaining. However, the problem doesn't provide information about the number sold of each type, so maybe the total remaining is the same regardless of how the sale was conducted.

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. Whether they sold more of one type or the other, the total remaining is 18. Because if they sold 38 Siamese and 7 house cats, total sold is 45, and 25 -7=18 house cats left. Similarly, if they sold 25 house cats and 20 Siamese, then 38 -20=18 Siamese cats left.

So, in both cases, the total number left is 18. Therefore, regardless of how the 45 were sold, the total number left is 18.

Wait, is there a mathematical way to see this? Let's consider that the total number of cats is 63. They sold 45, so 63 minus 45 is 18. So, the number of cats left is 18. The type doesn't matter because whether you subtract more from one type or the other, the total is the same.

So, the answer is 18 cats left.
</think>

The pet store initially had 38 Siamese cats and 25 house cats, totaling 63 cats. During the sale, 45 cats were sold. Regardless of how many of each type were sold, the total number of cats remaining is 63 minus 45, which equals 18.

                 Okay, so Carol is playing a trivia game, and there are three rounds. Let me try to figure out how many points she ended up with. Hmm, let's see. In the first round, she scored 17 points. That's straightforward. Then, in the second round, she scored 6 points. So far, so good. Now, in the last round, she lost 16 points. Wait, does that mean she lost 16 points from the previous total, or does it mean she scored negative 16 points? Hmm, I think it means she lost 16 points from her current total. So, she had some points, then she lost 16, which would be subtracting 16 from whatever she had before.

So, let me break it down step by step. First, after the first round, she has 17 points. Then, in the second round, she adds 6 points. So, 17 plus 6 is 23. Now, in the last round, she loses 16 points. So, subtracting 16 from 23 gives her 7 points. So, at the end of the game, she has 7 points left.

Wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the loss correctly. If she lost 16 points in the last round, does that mean her total decreased by 16? Yes, because losing points typically means subtracting from your current score. So, if she had 23 after two rounds, losing 16 would bring her to 7. That seems right.

Let me write it out numerically to double-check. Starting points: 17. After second round: 17 + 6 = 23. After third round: 23 - 16 = 7. Yeah, that adds up. So, Carol ends up with 7 points at the end of the game.
</think>

Carol starts with 17 points in the first round. She scores 6 points in the second round, bringing her total to 23. In the last round, she loses 16 points, which subtracts from her current total. Subtracting 16 from 23 leaves her with 7 points.

                    question:
                    .  Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy and , gave 5 to his little brother. If each box has 3 . pieces inside it, how many pieces did Dave still have? 
                <think>
First, I need to determine the total number of chocolate candy pieces Dave originally has. He purchased 12 boxes, and each box contains 3 pieces. So, I multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces per box to find the total.

Next, Dave gave 5 boxes to his little brother. Since each box has 3 pieces, I calculate how many pieces he gave away by multiplying the number of boxes he gave to his brother by the number of pieces per box.

Finally, to find out how many pieces Dave still has, I subtract the number of pieces he gave away from the total he originally had.
</think>

Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 5 to his little brother. If each box has 3 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Dave still have?

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of chocolate pieces Dave originally had.**
   - **Number of boxes bought:** 12
   - **Pieces per box:** 3
   - **Total pieces = Number of boxes × Pieces per box**
   \[
   \text{Total pieces} = 12 \times 3 = 36 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. **Determine how many pieces Dave gave to his little brother.**
   - **Boxes given to brother:** 5
   - **Pieces per box:** 3
   - **Pieces given to brother = Boxes given × Pieces per box**
   \[
   \text{Pieces given} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pieces Dave still has.**
   - **Total pieces initially:** 36
   - **Pieces given away:** 15
   - **Pieces remaining = Total pieces − Pieces given away**
   \[
   \text{Pieces remaining} = 36 - 15 = 21 \text{ pieces}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{21}

                    question:
                     A waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 39 customers to wait on. ; During the lunch rush he added another 12 customers. If 49 , of the ? customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave , a tip? 
                 Okay, let's see. So the waiter had 39 customers to wait on initially. Then during lunch rush, he added another 12 customers. Hmm, so first, how many customers were there in total?

Wait, is it 39 plus 12? That would make 51 customers total. Yeah, that makes sense. So total customers are 51.

Now, the question says that 49 of the ? customers didn't leave him a tip. Wait, hold on. Is it 49 of the total customers or 49 of the original 39? Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me read it again.

""A waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 39 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush he added another 12 customers. If 49 of the ? customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip?""

So the question is, ""49 of the ? customers didn't leave him a tip."" The ""of the ? customers"" part is confusing. Is it referring to the original 39, or the total 51?

I think it's referring to the total customers, because it says ""49 of the ? customers."" So maybe it's 49 of the 51 didn't leave a tip. Or perhaps it's 49 of the original 39. Hmm.

Wait, if it's referring to the original 39, then 49 is more than 39, which doesn't make sense because you can't have more people not tipping than the total number of customers. So that can't be. So it must be referring to the total.

So total customers are 51, and 49 didn't leave a tip. So how many left a tip? That would be 51 minus 49, which is 2. So is the answer 2? That seems low.

Wait, maybe I misinterpreted. Let me think again. Maybe it's 49 of the original 39 didn't leave a tip. But 49 is more than 39, so that doesn't make sense. So no, it has to be referring to the total.

Alternatively, maybe the question is saying that 49 of the ? customers, meaning the ones that were added, didn't leave a tip. But the way it's phrased is a bit unclear.

Wait, the way it's written is ""49 of the ? customers didn't leave him a tip."" The question is using ""of the ? customers"", where the question mark is probably referring to the number of customers. So it's probably 49 of the total customers.

So total customers are 51, 49 didn't tip, so 51 minus 49 is 2. So 2 customers left a tip. That seems really low, but maybe in a rush, people might not tip much.

Alternatively, maybe the question is 49 of the original 39 didn't leave a tip. But as I thought earlier, 49 is more than 39, which is impossible. So no, it must be referring to the total.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is ""49 of the ? customers didn't leave him a tip,"" where the question mark is referring to the number of customers, meaning 49 of the 12 added customers didn't tip. So 12 added customers, 49 didn't tip? That doesn't make sense either because 49 is more than 12.

Hmm, so maybe the question is actually referring to the original 39. So 49 is referring to the original 39, but 49 is more than 39, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question is ""49 of the ? customers didn't leave him a tip,"" where the question mark is referring to the total number of customers, which is 51. So 49 of the 51 didn't tip. So 51 minus 49 is 2. So 2 customers left a tip.

Alternatively, maybe it's referring to the 12 added customers, so 49 of the 12 didn't tip, which is impossible because 49 is more than 12.

So I think it's referring to the total customers. So total customers are 51, 49 didn't tip, so 2 left a tip. So the answer is 2.

Wait, but let me make sure. Maybe the question is written differently. Maybe it's 49 of the original 39 didn't tip, but that's impossible because 49 is more than 39. So no, it has to be referring to the total.

Another angle: maybe the total customers are 39 plus 12, which is 51. Then 49 didn't tip, so 2 tipped. So 2 is the answer.

Yes, that seems correct.

                    question:
                     The cafeteria had 50 ! apples. ! For lunch they handed out 5 to students and decided to use the rest to ; make pies. If each pie takes 5 apples, how many pies could they make? 
                 Okay, so I've got this problem here about the cafeteria having 50! apples. Hmm, that's a factorial, right? So 50! means 50 multiplied by 49 multiplied by 48 and so on all the way down to 1. But wait, that seems like a massive number. Maybe I don't need to calculate the entire thing because the numbers are so huge. Let me think.

So, the problem says that for lunch, they handed out 5 apples to each student. But it doesn't specify how many students there are. Wait, is that part of the problem? Let me check again. ""The cafeteria had 50! apples. For lunch, they handed out 5 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 5 apples, how many pies could they make?"" Hmm, okay, so maybe the number of students is given elsewhere? Wait, no, the problem is as written. Hmm, maybe I missed something.

Wait, maybe the number of students is actually part of the factorial notation? Like, maybe it's 50! apples, and the students are 5 each, so the number of students is 50! divided by 5. But no, that doesn't make sense because 50! is the total number of apples, and they're giving out 5 apples per student. So the number of students would be total apples divided by 5. But wait, the problem doesn't specify how many students there are. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again. ""The cafeteria had 50! apples. For lunch, they handed out 5 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 5 apples, how many pies could they make?"" So, perhaps the number of students is actually part of the problem, but it's not specified. Maybe it's a typo, and the number of students is 50, and they gave out 5 each, making 50*5 apples used for lunch, and the rest made into pies. But that's just my assumption because the problem as written doesn't specify the number of students.

Wait, maybe the number of students is given by the factorial. Like, 50! students, each getting 5 apples. But that would make the number of apples given out way too high, and the remaining apples for pies would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way it's written. Let me check the punctuation. It says, ""they handed out 5 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies."" So maybe ""students"" here refers to a single student, meaning they gave 5 apples to one student, and the rest is for pies. But that would mean the number of pies is (50! - 5)/5, but that seems odd because the number of pies would be almost 50! divided by 5, which is still a gigantic number.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is that the cafeteria had 50! apples, and for lunch, each student gets 5 apples. So if there are, say, N students, then the total apples given out would be 5*N. Then the remaining apples would be 50! - 5*N, and then they make pies with 5 apples each, so the number of pies would be (50! - 5*N)/5.

But wait, the problem doesn't give me the number of students. So perhaps the number of students is given by the factorial. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's a misprint, and the number of students is 50, so total apples given out would be 50*5=250 apples. Then the remaining apples would be 50! - 250, and the number of pies would be (50! - 250)/5. But that's still a huge number, and maybe not what the problem is asking for.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply that the cafeteria had 50! apples, and for lunch, they gave 5 apples to each student, and then used the rest to make pies, each requiring 5 apples. So the number of pies would be (50! - 5*number_of_students)/5. But since the number of students isn't given, maybe it's a trick question where the number of pies is (50! - 5)/5, implying that only one student got 5 apples, and the rest is used for pies. But that seems like an assumption.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the cafeteria had 50! apples, and for lunch, they gave 5 apples to a student",9

                    question:
                     Oliver had 33 dollars in January. By March he ! had spent 4 dollars. . If he got another 32 dollars from his mom, how much money would he ; have? 
                 Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, Oliver started with $33 in January. Then, by March, he had spent $4. Hmm, so I guess he spent that $4 over the two months. But wait, does that mean he spent $2 each month or something else? Or maybe he spent all $4 in January, and then nothing in February? The problem isn't entirely clear. Hmm. Well, maybe I should just take it at face value. So, he started with $33, spent $4, so he has $33 minus $4, which is $29 left.

Now, he got another $32 from his mom. So, I should add that to his remaining money. So, $29 plus $32 is... let's see, 29 plus 30 is 59, plus 2 more is 61. So, he would have $61 in total.

Wait, but did he get the $32 in March or after March? The problem says he got it ""from his mom,"" but doesn't specify when. Hmm. Maybe it's after the spending. So, if he had $29 left after spending $4, and then he gets another $32, adding up to $61. Yeah, that makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe the $32 is added before the spending? But the problem says he had 33 in January, then spent 4 by March, and then got another 32. So, the order is: starting with 33, then spending 4, then getting 32. So, it's 33 minus 4 plus 32.

So, 33 minus 4 is 29, plus 32 is 61. So, yeah, he'd have $61.

I think that's it. I don't see any complications here. Maybe I'm overcomplicating, but I think the answer is $61.

                    question:
                     Frank ; and his friend were buying trick decks from the magic shop for 7 . dollars each. How much . did they spend if Frank bought 3 decks and his friend bought 2 decks? 
                 Okay, so I need to figure out how much Frank and his friend spent buying trick decks. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I see that each deck costs $7. Frank bought 3 decks, and his friend bought 2. So, I think I need to calculate the total cost for each of them and then add them together to get the total amount they spent.

Starting with Frank: If one deck is $7, then three decks would be 3 multiplied by $7. Let me write that down. 3 * 7 equals... hmm, 3 times 7 is 21. So, Frank spent $21.

Now, moving on to his friend: He bought 2 decks. Since each deck is $7, I should multiply 2 by 7. 2 * 7 is 14. So, his friend spent $14.

To find the total amount they spent together, I need to add Frank's $21 and his friend's $14. So, 21 plus 14. Let me add them: 21 + 14 is 35. Therefore, together they spent $35.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, Frank bought 3 decks at $7 each: 3 * 7 = 21. Friend bought 2 decks: 2 * 7 = 14. Total is 21 + 14 = 35. Yep, that seems correct.

I don't think I missed anything here. The problem was straightforward—calculating individual costs and summing them. So, the total amount they spent is $35.
</think>

Frank bought 3 trick decks at $7 each, and his friend bought 2 trick decks at the same price. To find the total amount they spent, calculate the cost for each person and then sum them.

**Frank's cost:**  
3 decks × $7/deck = $21

**Friend's cost:**  
2 decks × $7/deck = $14

**Total cost:**  
$21 + $14 = $35

                     Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school . started, ? how many ? did he not wash? 
                 I think the problem is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash?

Hmm. So, total shirts to wash: 40 short + 23 long = 63 shirts.

He washed 29 of them. So, he hasn't washed 63 - 29 = 34 shirts. But wait, the question is asking how many he did not wash. So, is it 34?

Wait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting. Maybe he only washed 29 shirts in total, regardless of type. So, if he had to wash 40 short and 23 long, that's 63 shirts. If he only washed 29, then he didn't wash 63 - 29 = 34 shirts.

But maybe the question is considering that he washed some of each type. Maybe he didn't finish washing all short and long sleeves. So, he washed some short and some long.

Wait, but the problem says he had to wash 40 short and 23 long, but only washed 29 of them by the time school started. So, he could have washed some short and some long, totaling 29. So, the number he didn't wash would be the total minus the ones he did wash.

So, total shirts: 63. He washed 29, so he didn't wash 63 - 29 = 34.

But maybe the problem is trying to trick us. Maybe he only washed 29 shirts in total, not considering the types. So, he didn't wash the remaining 34 shirts, which would be a combination of short and long. So, the answer is 34.

But wait, the problem says he had to wash 40 short and 23 long, so maybe it's 40 short and 23 long. So, if he only washed 29, maybe he washed some of each, but the total is 29.

So, he washed x short shirts and y long shirts, where x + y = 29, and x <=40 and y <=23.

But the problem is asking how many he didn't wash. So, total shirts not washed would be 63 -29 =34.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that he didn't wash all of each type, so he didn't finish washing the short or the long shirts. So, he didn't wash 40 - x short and 23 - y long shirts. But the total number not washed would be (40 -x) + (23 - y) = (40 +23) - (x + y) =63 -29=34.

So, regardless of how he distributed the washing between short and long, the total not washed is 34.

So, the answer is 34 shirts.
</think>

Sam needed to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts, totaling 63 shirts. By the time school started, he had washed 29 shirts. Therefore, the number of shirts he did not wash is 63 minus 29, which equals 34.

Then, it mentions that 41 customers left. Hmm, so if 41 leave, we subtract that from the total. Let me write that down:

47 (starting number) - 41 (who left) = 6 (remaining customers).

Wait, but then it says he got another 20 customers. So after those 41 left, he gains 20 more. So that would be adding 20 to the remaining 6.

Let me compute that:

6 (remaining after 41 left) + 20 (new customers) = 26 (total customers now).

So, putting it all together, the waiter started with 47, lost 41, ended up with 6, and then gained 20, which brings the total to 26.

I think that's it. Let me just double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

47 minus 41 is definitely 6 because 40 would leave 7, and then one more leaves 6. Then 6 plus 20 is 26. Yep, that seems right.

So, the final number of customers the waiter would have is 26.

The waiter initially has 47 customers. After 41 leave, 6 remain. Then, he gains 20 more, resulting in a total of 26 customers.

{The final answer is 26.}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",26
