Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Initial Number of Songs:**
   - Paige initially has **11 songs** on her mp3 player.

2. **Deleting 9 Songs:**
   - She deletes **9 old songs**.
   - After deletion, the number of songs left on her mp3 player is:
     \[
     11 - 9 = 2 \text{ songs}
     \]

3. **Adding 8 New Songs:**
   - She adds **8 new songs** to the remaining 2 songs.
   - After addition, the total number of songs becomes:
     \[
     2 + 8 = 10 \text{ songs}
     \]

4. **Final Count of Songs:**
   - Therefore, after deleting and adding songs, Paige has **10 songs** on her mp3 player.

**Answer:**
Paige has \boxed{10} songs on her mp3 player.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",10,10.0,3.0

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     There were ! 39 girls and ? 4 boys trying ; out ; for the schools ? basketball team. If only ; 26 of : them got called ! back, how many students didn't ! make the cut? 
                 Okay, so I have this problem here about selecting a basketball team. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, the problem says there were ! 39 girls and ? 4 boys trying out for the school's basketball team. Wait, that's interesting. So, is the number of boys 4 or is it a question mark? Hmm, maybe it's a typo or something. Let me check again. It says ""39 girls and ? 4 boys."" Oh, so the number of boys is 4. That makes more sense. So, total students trying out are 39 girls plus 4 boys, which is 43 students in total.

Now, the problem states that only 26 of them got called back. So, 26 made the team. The question is asking how many students didn't make the cut. That means I need to find the number of students who were not selected, which would be the total number of students minus those who were selected.

So, total students = 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students. Selected students = 26. Therefore, students not selected = 43 - 26. Let me calculate that: 43 minus 26 is 17. So, 17 students didn't make the cut.

Wait, let me double-check my numbers. 39 girls plus 4 boys is indeed 43. Subtracting 26 gives 17. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes there.

But just to be thorough, let me consider if there was a different interpretation of the question. Could the problem be implying something else? Like, maybe the boys are a different number? But the problem says ""39 girls and ? 4 boys,"" so the number of boys is definitely 4. So, the total is 43, and subtracting 26 gives 17.

I think that's all. No need to complicate it further. The answer is 17 students didn't make the cut.
</think>

There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out, making a total of 43 students. If 26 were selected, the number of students not chosen is 43 minus 26, which equals 17.

{The final answer is 17.}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",17,17.0,17.0

                <think>
To determine how many coloring books Faye has in total, I first note that she initially has 34 coloring books.

Next, Faye gives away 3 of her coloring books. This reduces her total count to 34 minus 3, which equals 31 coloring books.

After giving away the books, Faye buys 48 more coloring books. Adding these to her current count, she now has 31 plus 48, totaling 79 coloring books.

Therefore, the total number of coloring books Faye has is 79.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Faye starts with **34** coloring books.
- She gives away **3** coloring books.
- Then, she buys **48** more coloring books.

**Step 1:** Calculate the number of coloring books after giving away 3.
\[
34 - 3 = 31
\]

**Step 2:** Add the 48 new coloring books to the remaining 31.
\[
31 + 48 = 79
\]

**Final Answer:**
Faye has a total of \(\boxed{79}\) coloring books.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",79,79.0,79.0
" . The school : cafeteria had 23 apples. If ; they used 20 to ! make , lunch for the : students : and then bought : 6 more, how many apples would they have? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     . The school : cafeteria had 23 apples. If ; they used 20 to ! make , lunch for the : students : and then bought : 6 more, how many apples would they have? 
                 Okay, so I have this problem here about the school cafeteria having 23 apples. They used 20 to make lunch for the students, and then bought 6 more. The question is asking how many apples they would have. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. The initial number of apples is 23. They used 20 of them for lunch. So, subtracting 20 from 23 should give me the number of apples left after making lunch. Let me write that down: 23 minus 20 equals... 3? Yeah, because 20 plus 3 is 23, so that makes sense.

Then, after using those 20 apples, they bought 6 more. So, I guess I need to add those 6 apples to the remaining 3. Let me calculate that: 3 plus 6 equals 9. So, adding 6 to the leftover 3 gives me 9 apples in total.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 23 apples, subtract 20 used for lunch, which leaves 3. Then adding 6 more gives me 9. Yeah, that seems right. No, I don't think I missed anything here.

So, putting it all together: the initial count is 23, minus 20 used, so 3 left. Then plus 6 bought, totaling 9 apples. That seems straightforward. I don't think there's any trick or hidden part in this problem. It's just basic subtraction and addition.

Just to visualize it another way, imagine the cafeteria starts with 23 apples on the table. They take away 20 to make lunch, leaving 3 apples on the table. Then they go out and buy 6 more apples to add to their stock. So, 3 plus 6 is 9. Yep, that adds up.

I don't see any alternative interpretations here. The problem is pretty direct. It's not like they used some apples for lunch and then used more for something else, which would complicate things. No, it's just using 20 to make lunch, then buying 6 more. So, the total would be the leftover after using 20 plus the 6 they bought.

Another way to think about it is: if you have 23 apples and you use 20, you're left with 3. Then, you add 6, so 3 plus 6 is 9. It's like two separate operations: subtracting the used apples and then adding the new ones.

I wonder if the problem is trying to test understanding of operations in a particular order. Sometimes, in word problems, the order of operations matters. But here, since they first use the apples and then buy more, it's clear that you first subtract the used ones and then add the new ones. There's no overlap or anything else mentioned, so I think the straightforward approach is correct.

Let me also consider if ""they used 20 to make lunch for the students"" implies that all the apples used were for the students, meaning perhaps the cafeteria didn't use any of the apples for anything else. So, no, it's just 20 apples used for lunch, leaving 3, then adding 6 more. So, 9 total.

I think I'm confident with this answer. It's pretty straightforward, and I don't see any hidden complexities.

The school cafeteria started with 23 apples. After using 20 to make lunch, 3 apples remained. They then bought 6 more, resulting in a total of 9 apples.

                    question:
                     In : a video game, each enemy ? defeated gives ! you ; 9 , points. If a , level . has ; 11 enemies ; total and you ! destroy all but 3 of them, how many points would you earn? 
                 I have to make sure to show all the steps clearly.
</think>
First, I need to determine how many enemies are defeated at each level. The problem states that each enemy defeated gives 9 points.

Given that there are 11 enemies at level 0 and I destroy all but 3, that means I defeated 8 enemies.

Calculating the points earned from defeating these 8 enemies: 8 enemies × 9 points per enemy = 72 points.

Therefore, the total points earned are 72.
</think>

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find the total points earned.

### **Problem Statement:**
- **Each enemy defeated gives 9 points.**
- **At level 0, there are 11 enemies.**
- **You destroy all but 3 enemies.**

**Question:** How many points would you earn?

### **Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Determine the Number of Enemies Defeated:**
   - Total enemies at level 0: 11
   - Destroyed all but 3: 
     \[
     \text{Enemies Defeated} = \text{Total Enemies} - \text{Enemies Not Destroyed} = 11 - 3 = 8
     \]

2. **Calculate the Points Earned:**
   - Points per enemy defeated: 9
   - Total points earned:
     \[
     \text{Total Points} = \text{Enemies Defeated} \times \text{Points per Enemy} = 8 \times 9 = 72

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     April's discount flowers : was having a ? sale . where each rose ; was . 4 dollars. If April started with ; 13 ; roses and had 4 roses ! left, how ? much money did she earn? 
                 Okay, so I have this problem here about April's discount flowers. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit confusing, but I'll try to break it down.

First, the problem says: April's discount flowers was having a ? sale. Where each rose ; was . 4 dollars. If April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left, how much money did she earn?

Wait, the question has some punctuation and symbols that aren't clear. Maybe those are supposed to be commas or periods. Let me try to parse it again.

It says: ""April's discount flowers : was having a ? sale . where each rose ; was . 4 dollars. If April started with ; 13 ; roses and had 4 roses ! left, how ? much money did she earn?""

So maybe the question is: April's discount flowers was having a sale. Where each rose was 4 dollars. If April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left, how much money did she earn?

Alright, that makes more sense. So, let me rephrase the problem:

April's discount flowers was having a sale. Each rose was priced at $4. April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left. How much money did she earn?

Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. If she started with 13 roses and had 4 left, that implies she sold some roses. So, she must have sold 13 minus 4, which is 9 roses. Each rose was sold for $4, so 9 times $4 would be the money earned.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says she started with 13 roses and had 4 left. So, she sold 13 - 4 = 9 roses. Each rose was $4, so 9 * $4 = $36. So, she earned $36.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem mentions a sale, so maybe the discount affects the price. But it says each rose was 4 dollars, so I think the discount is already applied. So, each rose is sold for $4.

Alternatively, maybe the sale was 25% off or something, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says each rose was 4 dollars. So, I think each rose was sold at $4, regardless of the sale.

So, she started with 13, sold 9, each at $4, so 9*4=36. So, she earned $36.

Wait, but the problem says ""how much money did she earn?"" So, the answer is $36.

Wait, but let me check again. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again:

""April's discount flowers : was having a ? sale . where each rose ; was . 4 dollars. If April started with ; 13 ; roses and had 4 roses ! left, how ? much money did she earn?""

So, the punctuation is a bit messed up, but it seems like the sale was on, each rose was $4. She started with 13, ended with 4, so sold 9, 9*4=36.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me. Maybe she didn't sell all the roses, but the problem doesn't specify why she had 4 left. Maybe she had a discount and bought more? Wait, no, the problem says she started with 13 and had 4 left, so she sold some.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the discount on the purchase, not the sale. Wait, no, the problem says she was having a sale where each rose was $4. So, the roses were being sold at $4 each, so she earned money from selling them.

So, she started with 13, sold some, had 4 left. So, she sold 9, each at $4, so 9*4=36. So, she earned $36.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe the discount was on the purchase, so she bought roses at a discount, but then sold them. But the problem doesn't mention buying, only that she had a sale where each rose was $4. So, I think she sold roses at $4 each, so 9*4=36.

Alternatively, maybe she didn't sell all the roses, but the problem says she had 4 left. So, she sold 9, earned $36.

I think that's it. So, the answer is $36.
</think>

April started with 13 roses and had 4 left after the sale. Therefore, she sold 9 roses. Each rose was sold for $4, so her total earnings were 9 × 4 = $36.

I need to determine how many shirts Ned didn't wash before school started.

First, I'll calculate the total number of shirts Ned needs to wash. He has to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts, making a total of 30 shirts.

Next, I'll find out how many shirts he actually washed. It's mentioned that he only washed 29 shirts by the time school started.

Finally, to find out how many shirts he didn't wash, I'll subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts he needed to wash. So, 30 shirts minus 29 washed shirts equals 1 shirt not washed.

                 Okay, so the company invited 47 people to a luncheon, but 7 didn't show up. So, how many people actually came? Let me do the subtraction first. 47 minus 7 equals 40. So, 40 people attended the luncheon.

Now, the tables they had held 5 people each. Hmm, so each table can seat 5 people. We need to figure out how many tables are needed to seat 40 people. To find this out, I should divide the total number of people by the number of people each table can hold. So, 40 divided by 5 equals 8. That means they need 8 tables.

Wait, let me double-check. If each table has 5 people, then 8 tables can seat 8 times 5, which is 40. Yep, that matches the number of people who attended. So, that seems correct.

To determine the number of tables needed, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of people who attended:**

</think>
Alright, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Tom had 5 books. He sold 4 of them and used the money to buy 38 new books. I need to find out how many books Tom would have in total after these transactions.

First, let me break down what's happening here. Tom starts with 5 books. Then he sells 4 of them. Selling books usually means he gets money in return. So, he earns some money from selling those 4 books. Then, he uses that money to buy 38 new books. So, the key here is to figure out how much money he made from selling the 4 books and then use that to buy the new ones.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify how much money he made from selling the books. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem assumes that the money he made is enough to buy the 38 new books, so I don't need to know the exact amount. Let me think again.

Tom had 5 books initially. He sold 4, so he's left with 1 book. Then he bought 38 new books. So, the total number of books he has would be the 1 he has left plus the 38 he bought, right? That would be 1 + 38 = 39 books. So, maybe that's the answer.

Wait, but does selling the books affect the count? Let me make sure. He started with 5, sold 4, so he has 1. Then he bought 38, so adding those gives 39 total. Yeah, that seems straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me into thinking about the money he made. But since the problem doesn't give specific values for the money, I think the intended answer is just the total number of books after the transactions, which is 39.

So, to sum it up: Tom starts with 5, sells 4, has 1 left, buys 38, so total is 39.

Tom starts with 5 books. He sells 4, leaving him with 1. He then buys 38 new books, resulting in a total of 39 books.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    :  ! For a birthday party Jerry bought . 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If . his fridge would only hold ! 9 on each shelf, how many : shelves ? would , he fill up? , 
                 So, I need to figure out how many shelves Jerry would fill up. He has a total of 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. His fridge can hold 9 sodas per shelf. So first, I should calculate the total number of sodas he has. That would be 41 plus 22, which is 63 sodas in total.

Now, he wants to know how many shelves he needs to fill. Since each shelf holds 9 sodas, I can divide the total number of sodas by 9 to find out how many shelves he needs. So, 63 divided by 9 is 7. That seems straightforward.

But wait, does he need to fill all the shelves or just enough to hold all the sodas? If he only needs enough shelves to hold all the sodas, then he doesn't necessarily need a whole number of shelves. He could have some shelves partially filled. So, maybe I should consider that.

However, the question is asking how many shelves he would fill up, not how many shelves he needs in total. So, if he has 7 shelves each holding 9 sodas, that's 63 sodas, which is exactly the number he has. So, he would fill up 7 shelves completely.

But let me double-check. If he only fills some shelves, then maybe he could have fewer shelves filled. But no, because each shelf holds 9 sodas, and he has 63, which is exactly 7 shelves. So, he would fill up all 7 shelves completely.

Alternatively, if the question was about the number of shelves he needs to store all the sodas, then the answer would be 7 shelves because 7 shelves can hold 63 sodas. But since the question is about how many shelves he would fill up, meaning how many full shelves he can make with his 63 sodas, the answer is still 7.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the question is implying that he wants to fill as many shelves as possible, not necessarily all of them. But since 63 is a multiple of 9, he can fill all 7 shelves completely. There's no soda left over, so he doesn't have any partially filled shelf. Therefore, the answer is 7 shelves.

Another angle: perhaps the question is trying to trick me into thinking about the number of different types of sodas. He has two types: regular and diet. But the fridge can hold any type, so the total number is still 63. So, the number of shelves is still 7.

Is there any other consideration? Maybe the arrangement of the sodas? But since it's a question about the number of shelves, it's purely a division problem.

So, to recap: total sodas = 41 + 22 = 63. Each shelf holds 9 sodas. Therefore, 63 / 9 = 7 shelves. He fills up all 7 shelves completely.
</think>

To determine how many shelves Jerry would fill, we first calculate the total number of sodas he has:

- **Regular sodas:** 41
- **Diet sodas:** 22

**Total sodas = 41 + 22 = 63**

Each shelf can hold **9** sodas. To find out how many shelves Jerry needs to fill, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold:

**Number of shelves = Total sodas ÷ Sodas per shelf = 63 ÷ 9 = 7**

Since Jerry has exactly 63 sodas and each shelf holds 9, he can fill **7 shelves completely** without any partial shelves.

**Answer:** Jerry would fill up 7 shelves.

</think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here about Emily planting vegetables. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes I get confused with these word problems, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says Emily started with 41 seeds. She planted 29 of them in a big garden. Then, in each of her small gardens, she put 4 seeds each. The question is, how many small gardens did she have?

Hmm, let's break it down. She has a total of 41 seeds. Out of those, 29 are planted in the big garden. So, that leaves the rest for the small gardens. To find out how many small gardens she has, I think I need to subtract the seeds used in the big garden from the total seeds.

So, total seeds = 41. Seeds in big garden = 29. So, 41 minus 29 should give me the number of seeds left for the small gardens.

Let me do the math: 41 - 29 equals... 12? Yeah, that's right. So, 12 seeds are left for the small gardens.

Now, each small garden has 4 seeds. So, if I have 12 seeds and each garden needs 4, I can divide the total remaining seeds by the number of seeds per small garden to find out how many small gardens there are.

So, 12 divided by 4 is 3. That means Emily has 3 small gardens.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. She started with 41, used 29 in the big garden, so 12 left. Each small garden has 4, so 12 divided by 4 is indeed 3. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I missed anything here. The problem didn't mention any other details, like the size of the big garden or anything else, so I think my approach is solid.
</think>

Emily started with 41 seeds. She used 29 in the big garden, leaving 12 seeds. Each small garden requires 4 seeds, so dividing 12 by 4 gives 3 small gardens.

                <think>
To determine how long Emily's candy will last, I need to calculate the total number of candy pieces she has.

Emily received 5 pieces from her neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister. Adding these together gives her a total of 18 candy pieces.

Next, I'll consider how Emily consumes the candy. She eats 9 pieces each day. To find out how many days the candy will last, I'll divide the total candy by the daily consumption.

So, 18 candy pieces divided by 9 pieces per day equals 2 days. Therefore, the candy will last Emily for 2 days.

**Solution:**

1. **Total Candy Received:**
   - **From neighbors:** 5 pieces
   - **From older sister:** 13 pieces
   - **Total candy = 5 + 13 = 18 pieces**

2. **Daily Candy Consumption:**
   - Emily eats **9 pieces/day**.

Mike is helping to put away 82 books. A librarian takes 10 books and leaves Mike with the rest. If Mike can fit 9 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of books Mike has to put away after the librarian takes some.**
   - Total books = 82
   - Librarian takes 10 books.
   - Books left with Mike = 82 - 10 = **72 books**.

2. **Calculate how many books Mike can put on each shelf.**
   - Mike can fit **9 books** on a shelf.

                 Corrected: The store had 40 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 25 of the old ones and put 21 new ones in the bin, how many would be in the bin?

Alright, so I've got this problem here: A store had 40 oranges in a bin. Then they threw away 25 of the old ones and put 21 new ones in the bin. How many oranges would be left in the bin? Hmm, okay, let's try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. The store initially has 40 oranges in a bin. Then, they did two actions: they threw away 25 of the old ones and put 21 new ones in the bin. The question is asking how many oranges are left in the bin after these actions.

Wait, let me make sure I'm reading this correctly. It says, ""they threw away 25 of the old ones and put 21 new ones in the bin."" So, they are removing some oranges and adding others. It's possible that the thrown away ones are the old ones, meaning they are getting rid of the old stock and replacing them with new ones.

Okay, so maybe the total number of oranges after these actions is the original number minus the ones thrown away plus the new ones added. That seems logical. So, if I take the initial count, subtract the 25 old ones, and then add 21 new ones, the total should be 40 - 25 + 21.

Wait, let me compute that: 40 minus 25 is 15, and 15 plus 21 is 36. So, 36 oranges would be left in the bin. Is that right? Hmm, let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me. Perhaps ""putting 21 new ones in the bin"" could mean adding 21 to the existing ones, but that doesn't seem right because they also threw away 25. So, it's a combination of removing and adding.

Let me break it down more carefully. Starting with 40 oranges. Then, they throw away 25. So, 40 minus 25 is 15. Then, they add 21 new ones. So, 15 plus 21 equals 36. So, that seems consistent.

Wait, but what if ""putting 21 new ones in the bin"" is in addition to the existing ones without removing any? Then it would be 40 plus 21, which is 61. But that doesn't make sense because the problem mentions throwing away 25 of the old ones. So, the throwing away part must be part of the process.

Another way to think about it is that they are replacing the old ones with new ones. So, they had 40, threw away 25, so 15 left, and then added 21 new ones, making it 36 total. That seems to make sense.

I don't think there's a trick here. It's straightforward subtraction and addition. So, 40 minus 25 is 15, plus 21 is 36. So, the final number of oranges in the bin is 36.

Wait, but let me double-check. If you take 40, throw away 25, you have 15 left. Then, adding 21 new ones, so 15 + 21 is 36. Yep, that's correct.

I don't see any alternative interpretation here. The key is that they are removing some and adding others, so it's a net change. So, the total is the original minus the thrown away plus the added.

Therefore, the final answer is 36 oranges in the bin.
</think>

The store initially had 40 oranges. After throwing away 25 old ones, 15 oranges remained. Then, 21 new oranges were added, resulting in a total of 36 oranges.

</think>
Alright, so I need to figure out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that the building needs a total of 9 windows. The builder has already installed 6 of them. So, I should subtract the ones already installed from the total needed to find out how many more windows need to be installed.

That means the number of windows left to install is 9 minus 6, which is 3. Okay, so there are 3 windows remaining.

Next, I need to determine how long it takes to install each window. The problem states that it takes 6 hours to install each window. Since there are 3 windows left, I can multiply the number of windows by the time it takes to install each one to find the total time required.

So, 3 windows multiplied by 6 hours per window equals 18 hours. Hmm, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total windows needed: 9
Windows already installed: 6
Remaining windows: 9 - 6 = 3
Time per window: 6 hours
Total time needed: 3 * 6 = 18 hours

Yes, that all adds up. So, it will take the builder 18 hours to install the remaining windows.

To determine how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of windows remaining to be installed:**
   - Total windows needed = 9
   - Windows already installed = 6
   - Remaining windows = 9 - 6 = 3

2. **Calculate the total time required to install the remaining windows:**
   - Time to install one window = 6 hours
   - Total time = 3 windows * 6 hours per window = 18 hours

**Answer:** It will take the builder 18 hours to install the remaining windows.

                    .  ; A teacher had ! 34 worksheets to grade. ! If she . graded 7, . but then another , 36 : were turned in, how many worksheets would she have to grade? 
                 
Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many worksheets the teacher has to grade. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says the teacher had 34 worksheets to grade. Then it mentions that she graded 7, but then another 36 were turned in. Hmm, okay, so initially, she had 34, she graded 7, but then more came in. I need to find out the total number she has to grade now.

Wait, let me make sure I understand the timeline here. She started with 34, graded some, and then more were submitted. So does that mean the 36 are in addition to the original 34? Or were the 36 part of the original 34? Hmm, the wording says another 36 were turned in. So I think that means in addition to the original 34.

But let me read it again: ""If she graded 7, but then another, 36 were turned in."" So it seems like after grading 7, 36 more came in. So the total number of worksheets she has to grade is the original 34 plus the additional 36. So that would be 34 + 36.

Wait, but hold on. If she had 34 to grade, and she graded 7, does that mean she already graded 7, so the remaining are 34 - 7 = 27? Then another 36 came in. So would that mean the total is 27 + 36? Or is it 34 + 36?

Hmm, this is where I might be getting confused. Let me think about it. If she started with 34, she graded 7, so she has 34 - 7 = 27 left. Then, another 36 were turned in. So those 36 are additional worksheets that she now has to grade. So does that mean she now has 27 + 36 to grade? Or is it 34 + 36?

Wait, maybe the problem is saying that she had 34, then another 36 came in, so total is 34 + 36. But then she graded 7 of them. So perhaps the total number she has to grade is 34 + 36, regardless of how many she graded. But then it says she graded 7, but then another 36 were turned in. So maybe the 36 are in addition to the original 34, making the total 70, but she graded 7, so the remaining would be 70 - 7 = 63.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the 36 are part of the original 34 or not. The wording says ""another 36 were turned in."" So that suggests that they were in addition, so 34 + 36 = 70 total. She graded 7, so she still has 70 - 7 = 63 to grade.

But let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The original number is 34, and then another 36 are turned in. So total is 70. She graded 7, so the remaining would be 70 - 7 = 63.

Alternatively, if the 36 were part of the original 34, then she graded 7, leaving 34 -7 = 27, and then 36 more came in, making it 27 + 36 = 63. So either way, the total is 63.

Wait, so whether the 36 are part of the original 34 or added later, the result is the same. Because if she had 34, graded 7, and then another 36 came in, making it 34 + 36 = 70, but she graded 7, so 70 -7 =63. Alternatively, if the 36 were part of the original 34, she graded 7, leaving 27, and then 36 more came in, so 27 +36 =63.

So either way, the answer is 63.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe the 36 were turned in after she graded 7, so the total number she has to grade is 34 +36, but she already graded 7, so the total is 70, and she has to grade 70 -7 =63.

Alternatively, if the 36 were part of the original 34, then she had 34, graded 7, so 34 -7=27 left, then another 36 came in, so 27 +36=63.

Either way, it's 63.

So the final answer is 63.

Wait, but let me make sure. The problem says she had 34 worksheets to grade. She graded 7, but then another 36 were turned in. So the 36 were turned",63,63.0,36.0

</think>

Alright, let's try to figure out how many candies Frank can buy with his tickets. So, Frank won 33 tickets from playing ""whack a mole"" and 9 tickets from playing ""skee ball."" That means he has a total of 33 + 9 tickets. Let me write that down first.

Total tickets = 33 (whack a mole) + 9 (skee ball) = 42 tickets.

Now, each candy costs 6 tickets. I need to find out how many candies Frank can buy with 42 tickets. To do that, I should divide the total number of tickets by the number of tickets each candy costs.

Number of candies = Total tickets ÷ Tickets per candy = 42 ÷ 6.

Let me calculate that. 42 divided by 6 is... 7? Wait, let me double-check. 6 times 7 is 42. Yep, that's right.

So, Frank can buy 7 candies with his 42 tickets.

                    question:

                 Okay, so I've got this problem here about figuring out how much a group of people would cost at a restaurant. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says that each adult meal costs $7, and kids eat free. So, if I have a group of people, some of whom are adults and some are kids, the total cost would just be the number of adults multiplied by $7, right? Because kids don't pay anything.

Alright, the group that came in has 13 people. Out of these 13, 9 are kids. Hmm, so wait, does that mean there are 13 minus 9 kids, which is 4 adults? Let me check that math. Yeah, 13 total people minus 9 kids equals 4 adults. So, 4 adults and 9 kids.

Now, since each adult meal costs $7, the cost for the adults would be 4 times $7. Let me calculate that. 4 times 7 is 28. So, the adult meals would cost $28 in total.

As for the kids, they eat free, so there's nothing to pay for them. That means the only cost is from the adults. So, the total cost for the group is just the $28 for the adults.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. The problem says 9 were kids, so does that mean 9 kids and the rest adults? Yeah, 13 minus 9 is 4 adults. So, 4 adults times $7 each is $28. No kids to pay for, so total is $28.

Is there any other way this could be interpreted? Like, maybe some kids also have meals, but the problem says kids eat free, so that shouldn't affect the cost. So, the only cost is the adults.

So, yeah, the total cost for the group would be $28.
</think>

To determine the total cost for the group, we first identify the number of adults and kids. There are 13 people in total, with 9 being kids. Subtracting the kids from the total gives us 4 adults.

Each adult meal costs $7, so the cost for the adults is 4 multiplied by $7, which equals $28. Since kids eat free, there are no additional costs.

**The final answer is $28.**<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",28,28.0,28.0

                 Okay, so Paige has math and science homework. She had 43 math problems and 12 science problems. She finished 44 problems at school. I need to figure out how many problems she has left to do for homework. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I should figure out how many problems she finished in each subject. She finished 44 in total. But wait, she has two subjects: math and science. So I need to know how many math and science problems she finished. But the problem doesn't say she finished some of each; it just says she finished 44 at school. So maybe she finished all her math problems or all her science problems? Or maybe a combination.

Wait, no. She has 43 math problems and 12 science problems. If she finished 44 at school, that could mean she finished some math and some science. But 43 + 12 is 55 problems. She only finished 44, so she didn't finish all. Hmm.

Wait, maybe she finished all her math problems and some science ones. Or all her science and some math. Let me see.

If she finished all 43 math problems, that would take 43 of her 44 finished problems. Then she would have 1 more problem to finish in science. Since she has 12 science problems, she could finish 1 of them. So 43 math + 1 science = 44 total.

Alternatively, if she finished all 12 science problems, that would take 12 of her 44. Then she would have 44 - 12 = 32 math problems left. But she only had 43 to start with, so she finished 32 math problems? Wait, no, wait. If she finished all 12 science problems, then she used 12 of her 44 finished problems. So 44 - 12 = 32 math problems finished. So she has 43 - 32 = 11 math problems left.

Wait, so if she finished all 12 science, she has 11 math left. If she finished all 43 math, she has 1 science left. So which scenario gives the minimal number of homework problems? Or is there another way?

Wait, maybe she finished some of each. Let me think differently. Let me denote m as the number of math problems she finished and s as the number of science problems she finished.

So m + s = 44.

But she can't finish more than 43 math or more than 12 science.

So m ≤ 43 and s ≤ 12.

We need to find m and s such that m + s = 44, with m ≤43 and s ≤12.

So s can be at most 12, so m would be at least 44 - 12 = 32.

But m can't exceed 43. So m is between 32 and 43.

Wait, but we need to find how many homework problems she has left.

She has 43 math and 12 science to start with.

If she finished m math and s science, then remaining math problems are 43 - m and remaining science problems are 12 - s.

Total remaining problems would be (43 - m) + (12 - s) = 55 - (m + s) = 55 - 44 = 11.

Wait, regardless of how many she finished in each, the total remaining is 11. Because total problems are 55, she finished 44, so 55 - 44 = 11 left.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. So regardless of how she split the 44 problems between math and science, she has 11 problems left.

Wait, that makes sense because total problems are 43 +12=55. She finished 44, so 55-44=11 left. So the answer is 11.

Wait, but the initial problem said she had 43 math and 12 science problems, and finished 44 at school. So total homework left is 11.

So maybe I overcomplicated it earlier, but the key is total problems minus finished.

But let me double-check. If she finished 44, total is 55, so 55 -44=11. So yeah, 11.

So the answer is 11.

But wait, in the initial problem, the punctuation was a bit messed up with semicolons and stuff. But I think the key is that total problems are 43 +12=55, finished 44, so 11 left.

So I think the answer is 11.

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Rachel was playing a video game where she scores 9 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 5 treasures on the first level and 2 on the second, what would her score be?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Scoring System:**
   - Rachel gets **9 points** for **each** treasure she finds.
   - This means that the number of treasures multiplied by 9 gives her total score.

2. **Calculate the Score from the First Level:**
   - On the first level, Rachel found **5 treasures**.
   - Score from the first level = Number of treasures × Points per treasure
   - Score from first level = 5 × 9 = 45 points

3. **Calculate the Score from the Second Level:**
   - On the second level, Rachel found **2 treasures**.
   - Score from the second level = Number of treasures × Points per treasure
   - Score from second level = 2 × 9 = 18 points

4. **Combine the Scores from Both Levels:**
   - Total score = Score from first level + Score from second level
   - Total score = 45 + 18 = 63 points

                 {The final answer is}
</think>

Alright, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about a waiter named ""The Greasy Spoon"" who had 26 customers to wait on during lunch rush. Then, he added another 27 customers. Out of these 27 new customers, 27 didn't leave him a tip. We need to find out how many of the customers did leave a tip.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It seems like there are two groups of customers: the original 26 and the additional 27. Out of the 27, 27 didn't tip, so we're supposed to find out how many of them did tip. That means I need to figure out how many customers are in the group of 27 and subtract those who didn't tip from the total.

Let me break it down:

1. **Total customers after adding the new ones:**
   - Original customers: 26
   - Additional customers: 27
   - Total customers = 26 + 27 = 53

2. **Out of these 27 additional customers:**
   - 27 didn't leave a tip.
   - So, we need to find out how many did leave a tip.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. If all 27 didn't leave a tip, then the number of customers who did leave a tip would be zero. But the question seems to suggest that some did leave a tip. Maybe I misread the problem.

Let me read it again:

""A waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 26 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush, he added another 27 customers. If 27 of the customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip?""

Hmm, maybe the 27 customers who didn't leave a tip are among the additional 27. So, of the 27 new customers, 27 didn't tip, meaning none of them tipped. But that can't be right because the question asks how many did leave a tip, implying that some did.

Wait, maybe the total customers are 26 + 27 = 53, and 27 didn't leave a tip. So, the number of customers who did leave a tip would be 53 - 27 = 26.

That makes sense. So, the total number of customers is 53, and 27 didn't tip, so 26 did tip.

Let me confirm:

- Total customers = 26 original + 27 new = 53
- 27 didn't tip
- So, customers who tipped = 53 - 27 = 26

Yes, that seems correct.

                 Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: A toy store had 17 giant stuffed bears in stock. Then they got another shipment with 10 bears. They put the bears onto shelves with 9 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?

Hmm, okay. So the store starts with 17 bears. Then they receive an additional 10, making the total number of bears 17 + 10. Let me calculate that first.

17 plus 10 is 27. So altogether, the store has 27 giant stuffed bears now.

Next, they put these bears onto shelves, and each shelf holds 9 bears. The question is asking how many shelves they used. So, I think I need to divide the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf to find out how many shelves are needed.

So, that would be 27 divided by 9. Let me do that calculation.

27 divided by 9 is 3. So, they used 3 shelves.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I do math quickly, I might overlook something.

Starting with 17 bears, adding 10 gives me 27. Then, each shelf holds 9, so 27 divided by 9 is indeed 3. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think there's anything tricky here. It's a straightforward division problem. The key steps are adding the initial stock and the shipment, then dividing by the number of bears per shelf.

So, I think the answer is 3 shelves.
</think>

The toy store initially has 17 bears and receives an additional 10, making a total of 27 bears. Each shelf holds 9 bears, so dividing the total by 9 gives 3 shelves.

                 Okay, so Gwen has this book case, and she's organizing it. She wants each shelf to have exactly 4 books. Hmm, that's the key point here—each shelf must have 4 books. Now, the problem mentions two types of books: mystery books and picture books. She has 5 shelves of mystery books and 3 shelves of picture books. Wait, so the total number of shelves is 5 plus 3, which is 8 shelves. But each shelf has 4 books. So, if I think about it, each shelf has 4 books, regardless of whether they are mystery or picture. So, maybe I need to calculate the total number of books by multiplying the number of shelves by 4 and then considering both types.

But hold on, the problem says she has 5 shelves of mystery books and 3 shelves of picture books. So, how many books are on each type? For the mystery books, if each shelf has 4 books and there are 5 shelves, then the total number of mystery books would be 5 times 4, which is 20. Similarly, for the picture books, she has 3 shelves, each with 4 books, so that's 3 times 4, which is 12. 

So, adding those together, 20 mystery books plus 12 picture books gives a total of 32 books. But let me double-check that. Each shelf has 4 books, so for 5 shelves of mystery, 5 times 4 is 20. For 3 shelves of picture books, 3 times 4 is 12. So, 20 plus 12 is indeed 32. 

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it another way. If all shelves had both mystery and picture books, but she has separate shelves for each type. So, she has 5 shelves dedicated to mystery, each with 4 books, and 3 shelves for pictures, each with 4 books. So, the total number of books is just the sum of these two groups.

Wait, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the total number of shelves first. She has 5 + 3 = 8 shelves in total. Each shelf has 4 books, so total books would be 8 times 4, which is 32. So, regardless of the type, each shelf contributes 4 books, so the total is 32. That makes sense because whether it's mystery or picture, each shelf is counted separately, but each shelf only has 4 books. So, the total number of books is just the total number of shelves multiplied by 4. So, 8 shelves times 4 is 32.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says ""each of the shelves had exactly 4 books on it."" So, all shelves, regardless of type, have 4 books. So, if she has 5 shelves of mystery and 3 shelves of picture, that's 8 shelves in total, each with 4 books. So, 8 times 4 is 32. So, the total number of books is 32. 

I think that's solid. I don't see any other interpretation here. She has separate shelves for each type, but each shelf only has 4 books. So, adding all the books from all shelves gives 32. Yeah, that makes sense.
</think>

Gwen has 5 shelves of mystery books and 3 shelves of picture books. Each shelf contains exactly 4 books. 

1. Calculate the total number of mystery books: 5 shelves × 4 books/shelf = 20 books.
2. Calculate the total number of picture books: 3 shelves × 4 books/shelf = 12 books.
3. Add the two totals together to find the overall number of books: 20 + 12 = 32 books.

First, I need to determine the total number of pictures Wendy uploaded, which is 79.

Next, I'll identify how many pictures she placed into the first album, which is 44.

To find out how many pictures were placed into the other albums, I'll subtract the 44 pictures from the total of 79. This gives me 79 minus 44, which equals 35 pictures.

Since these remaining 35 pictures are distributed equally among 5 different albums, I'll divide 35 by 5 to find the number of pictures in each of the remaining albums.

                 Okay, so I have this problem here about April's discount flowers. It says that they were having a sale where each rose was $7. April started with 9 roses and had 4 roses left. I need to figure out how much money she earned. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I want to understand what the problem is asking. It's about a sale where each rose costs $7. April starts with 9 roses and ends up with 4. So, she must have sold some roses. The question is, how much money did she earn from selling those roses?

Alright, so to find out how much she earned, I need to find out how many roses she sold. Once I know the number of roses sold, I can multiply that by the price per rose, which is $7. So, the formula I think I'll use is:

Money earned = Number of roses sold × Price per rose

But to find the number of roses sold, I can subtract the number of roses left from the total number she started with. That is:

Roses sold = Total roses initially - Roses left

Plugging in the numbers:

Roses sold = 9 - 4 = 5

So, she sold 5 roses. Now, calculating the money earned:

Money earned = 5 × $7 = $35

Wait, let me double-check that. She started with 9 roses, sold some, and had 4 left. So, 9 minus 4 is indeed 5. At $7 each, 5 times 7 is 35. That seems straightforward.

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe, but I think this method is the simplest. Another way could be to think about the cost or revenue, but in this case, it's about revenue, so the method I used is appropriate.

Alternatively, if I think about it in terms of equations, let me set it up:

Let R = roses sold

We know that:
Initial roses - Roses left = Roses sold
So,
9 - 4 = R
R = 5

Then, revenue is R × 7 = 5 × 7 = 35.

Same result. So, regardless of the method, I end up with $35.

Is there any possibility I might have misread the problem? Let me check again.

The problem states: ""April's discount flowers : was : having a sale where each , rose was 7 dollars. If April started ; with 9 roses and had ! 4 roses . left, ? how : much money did she : earn?""

Wait, the punctuation is a bit off in the problem statement, but the key numbers are 9 roses initially and 4 left. So, I think my interpretation is correct.

Another thing to consider: is the sale about the price per rose, or are there discounts on the total? The problem says ""each rose was 7 dollars,"" so I think it's per rose. So, each rose she sold was $7, so 5 roses × $7 = $35.

Alternatively, if the sale was a discount on the total purchase, but the wording is ""each rose was 7 dollars,"" which suggests the individual price, not a discount on the total. So, no, I think the per-rose price is correct.

Therefore, after all this thinking, I believe the answer is $35.
</think>

April started with 9 roses and had 4 left after the sale. The number of roses sold is 9 - 4 = 5. Each rose was sold for $7, so the total money earned is 5 × 7 = $35.

                 ```

</think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here about a pet store that has some cats and during a sale, they sold some, and I need to figure out how many cats they have left. Let me try to break this down step by step because I want to make sure I understand it correctly.

First, the problem mentions that the pet store has ""13 siamese cats and 5 house cats."" Hmm, so that's a total of 13 plus 5, which is 18 cats. Wait, but I should double-check that to make sure I didn't misread. So, 13 Siamese and 5 house cats. Yeah, that adds up to 18.

Then it says that during a sale, they sold 10 cats. So, I think that means they sold 10 of these cats. Now, the question is, how many cats do they have left? So, I guess I need to subtract the number sold from the total number they had initially.

Let me write this out to visualize it better. Initially, they have 13 Siamese and 5 house cats. So, total cats = 13 + 5 = 18.

They sold 10 cats. So, the number of cats left would be 18 - 10. Let me calculate that: 18 minus 10 is 8. So, that would mean they have 8 cats left.

Wait a second, does it matter how many of each type they sold? The problem just says they sold 10 cats, not specifying if it was Siamese or house cats. So, I think it doesn't matter because whether they sold all Siamese, all house, or a mix, the total number sold is 10. So, subtracting 10 from the total gives the correct remaining number.

Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering each type separately. So, if they sold 10 cats, how does that affect the counts of Siamese and house cats?

But since the problem doesn't specify how many of each type were sold, I can't determine the exact number of each type left. Therefore, the only safe approach is to consider the total number sold and subtract that from the total number initially.

So, initial total cats: 13 + 5 = 18.

Sold: 10.

Remaining: 18 - 10 = 8.

Therefore, the pet store has 8 cats left.

I don't think there's any trick here. It's a straightforward subtraction problem. The types (Siamese vs. house) might be a red herring because without knowing how many of each were sold, we can't know the exact distribution, but the total number is sufficient for the problem.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem starts with ""A pet store had 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats."" So, that's 18 in total. Then during a sale, they sold 10 cats. So, regardless of the types sold, the total number sold is 10, so subtracting 10 from 18 gives 8.

Yes, that seems correct. I don't think I need to consider each type separately because the problem doesn't provide that information. It's possible that the types were included just to give context about the store's inventory.

So, to sum it up, the pet store started with 18 cats, sold 10, so they have 8 left.
</think>

The pet store initially had a total of 18 cats (13 Siamese and 5 house cats). During the sale, they sold 10 cats. Subtracting the number sold from the total gives:

18 - 10 = 8

Therefore, the store has 8 cats left.

                    question:

                 Okay, so Victor works at a grocery store and makes $6 an hour. He worked 5 hours on Monday and 5 hours on Tuesday. I need to figure out how much he made in total over those two days. Hmm, let me break it down. 

First, I should find out how much he earned each day and then add them together. On Monday, he worked 5 hours at $6 per hour. So, Monday's earnings would be 5 multiplied by 6. Let me calculate that: 5 x 6 is 30. So, he made $30 on Monday.

Now, for Tuesday, he also worked 5 hours. Using the same hourly rate, his earnings would be 5 x 6 as well. That's also 30 dollars. So, he made another $30 on Tuesday.

To find the total earnings over the two days, I need to add the money he made each day. That would be $30 from Monday plus $30 from Tuesday. Adding those together: 30 + 30 equals 60. So, Victor earned a total of $60 over the two days.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Each day he worked 5 hours at $6, so each day he makes $30. Two days would be 30 times 2, which is indeed $60. Yep, that seems right.
</think>

Victor earned $6 per hour. On Monday, he worked 5 hours, and on Tuesday, he also worked 5 hours.

Calculating his earnings:
- Monday: 5 hours × $6/hour = $30
- Tuesday: 5 hours × $6/hour = $30

Total earnings over the two days: $30 + $30 = $60

                 Okay, so Megan has baked 71 cupcakes. Hmm, that's a lot! Her brother, Todd, ate 43 of them. I need to figure out how many packages she could make if each package has 7 cupcakes. Let me think step by step.

First, how many cupcakes did Todd eat? The problem says 43. So, Megan started with 71 cupcakes. If Todd ate 43, then how many are left? I subtract 43 from 71. Let me do that: 71 minus 43. Hmm, 70 minus 40 is 30, and 1 minus 3 is negative 2, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should do it properly. 71 minus 43: 71 minus 40 is 31, then minus 3 more is 28. So, 28 cupcakes left.

Now, Megan wants to make packages with 7 cupcakes each. So, how many packages can she make from the remaining 28 cupcakes? To find that, I need to divide the number of leftover cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per package. So, 28 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 7 goes into 28 four times because 7 times 4 is 28. So, she can make 4 packages.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If she has 28 cupcakes and each package has 7, then 28 divided by 7 is indeed 4. So, yes, she can make 4 packages.

So, Megan can make 4 packages with 7 cupcakes each after her brother ate 43 cupcakes.

But wait, another thought: is there any leftover cupcakes or is it exact? Since 28 is perfectly divisible by 7, there are no leftovers. So, 4 packages exactly.

I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Total cupcakes: 71.

Todd ate: 43.

Cupcakes left: 71 - 43 = 28.

Packages per cupcake: 7.

Number of packages: 28 / 7 = 4.

Yes, that seems right. So, Megan can make 4 packages.
</think>

Megan baked 71 cupcakes. Her brother, Todd, ate 43 of them. To find out how many packages she could make, we first calculate the remaining cupcakes:

71 total - 43 eaten = 28 cupcakes left.

Each package contains 7 cupcakes. Therefore, the number of packages she can make is:

28 cupcakes ÷ 7 cupcakes per package = 4 packages.

                 Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two friends playing an online video game. Then, two more players join them. Each player has 6 lives. The question is asking how many lives they have in total.

First, I need to figure out the total number of players. Initially, there are two friends. Then, two more players join, making the total number of players four.

Each of these players has 6 lives. So, to find the total number of lives, I can multiply the total number of players by the number of lives each player has.

That would be 4 players multiplied by 6 lives each. 4 times 6 equals 24.

So, altogether, they have 24 lives.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Initially, two players, each with 6 lives, that's 12 lives. Then, two more players join, each also with 6 lives. That adds another 12 lives. So, 12 plus 12 equals 24. Yeah, that seems right.

I think I've got it. The total number of lives they have is 24.
</think>

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of players:**
   - Initially, there are **2 friends** playing the game.
   - Then, **2 more players** join.
   - Total players = 2 (initial) + 2 (new) = 4 players.

2. **Calculate the number of lives each player has:**
   - Each player has **6 lives**.

3. **Find the total number of lives:**
   - Multiply the number of players by the number of lives per player.
   - Total lives = 4 players × 6 lives/player = 24 lives.

                 Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I want to make sure I understand it step by step. Let me read it again:

""Wendy picked 103 flowers for her friend’s wedding. She was making bouquets with 8! flowers in each one. If 47 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?""

Alright, let me break this down. First, Wendy has a total of 103 flowers. She was making bouquets, each containing 8! flowers. But 47 flowers wilted, so she can't use those. I need to figure out how many bouquets she can still make with the remaining flowers.

Wait, hold on. The problem mentions 8! flowers in each bouquet. I should remember that 8! means 8 factorial, which is 8×7×6×...×1. Let me calculate that.

8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. Let me compute this step by step:

8 × 7 = 56

56 × 6 = 336

336 × 5 = 1680

1680 × 4 = 6720

6720 × 3 = 20160

20160 × 2 = 40320

40320 × 1 = 40320

So, 8! equals 40,320. That's a lot of flowers per bouquet.

Wait, but Wendy only has 103 flowers. If each bouquet requires 40,320 flowers, she can't make even one bouquet because 40,320 is way more than 103. That seems impossible. Did I do something wrong here?

Let me go back to the problem. It says she picked 103 flowers. So, she has 103 flowers in total. Each bouquet requires 8! flowers, which is 40,320. So, if she can't use the 47 wilted flowers, she's left with 103 - 47 = 56 flowers.

56 flowers. Each bouquet needs 40,320. So, how many bouquets can she make? It's 56 divided by 40,320. But that's a tiny fraction, less than one. So, she can't make any bouquets because she doesn't have enough flowers.

Wait, but maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.

""Wendy picked 103 flowers... making bouquets with 8! flowers in each one. If 47 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?""

Hmm, maybe the problem is in the wording. It says she was making bouquets, but maybe she was trying to make multiple bouquets, each with 8! flowers. But with only 56 flowers, she can't make any. So, the answer is zero bouquets.

But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating 8!.

Wait, let me double-check 8!:

8 × 7 = 56

56 × 6 = 336

336 × 5 = 1680

1680 × 4 = 6720

6720 × 3 = 20160

20160 × 2 = 40320

Yes, that's correct. So, 8! is indeed 40,320.

So, with 56 flowers, she can't make any bouquets because each bouquet requires 40,320, which is way more than she has.

Wait, maybe the problem was written differently, and perhaps it was 8 flowers in each bouquet, not 8! Maybe a typo. But the problem says 8!, so I have to go with that.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the 47 wilted flowers as part of the 103, so total usable flowers are 56. Then, 56 divided by 40,320 is less than one, so she can't make any bouquets.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach, like using factorials differently. Wait, but 8! is a specific number, so it's 40,320.

Wait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it was supposed to be 8 flowers, not 8! So, if each bouquet had 8 flowers, then 56 flowers would allow her to make 7 bouquets (since 8×7=56). But the problem says 8! flowers, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant 8 times the number of flowers, but that's not how factorials work. So, I think the correct calculation is that she can't make any bouquets.

But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

                 Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, Adam has 48 books. He sells 19 of them and uses the money from that sale to buy 38 new books. The question is, how many books does Adam have in total now? Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

First, let's figure out how much money Adam made from selling 19 books. But wait, the problem doesn't mention the price per book or anything about the money. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again.

It says, ""Adam had 48 books. If he sold 19 ? of them and used : the money he earned , to buy 38 ! new , books, how many , books would Adam . have?"" Hmm, the question marks and colons are probably indicating variables or something, but since they aren't specified, maybe it's a typo or placeholder. Perhaps it's meant to be a straightforward subtraction and addition problem.

Okay, maybe the question is asking: Adam had 48 books. He sold 19 of them and bought 38 new books with the money. How many does he have left? So, he started with 48, sold 19, so he has 48 - 19 = 29 left. Then he bought 38 new ones, so he adds 38 to his remaining books. So, 29 + 38 = 67. So, he would have 67 books in total.

Wait, but the problem mentions ""used : the money he earned , to buy 38 ! new , books"". The exclamation marks and colons are confusing. Maybe it's a translation issue or some formatting error. But the main idea is that he sold some books for money and used that money to buy new ones. So, he's not increasing the total number of books unless he bought more than he sold.

Let me confirm. Starting with 48, selling 19 gives him 29 left. Then he uses the money from 19 sold to buy 38 new. So, he now has 29 + 38 = 67. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 67.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to test if I recognize that he's converting 19 into 38, but that doesn't quite make sense. If he sold 19 and bought 38, that's an increase of 19 books. But he started with 48, so 48 - 19 = 29, plus 38 bought, so total 67. Yeah, that seems right.

I think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer is 67.
</think>

Adam initially has 48 books. He sells 19, leaving him with 29. He then buys 38 new books, so he ends up with a total of 29 + 38 = 67 books.

                    question:

                 I need to solve this problem step by step, but I'm a bit confused about how to approach it. Let me try to think through it.

First, I need to figure out the total number of people going on the field trip. Nancy's class has 12 students and 3 adults. So, I should add those together. 12 plus 3 equals 15 people in total.

Next, I need to determine how many vans are needed to transport all these people. Each van can hold up to 5 people. So, I should divide the total number of people by the number of people each van can carry. That would be 15 divided by 5.

Wait, 15 divided by 5 is 3. So, does that mean they need 3 vans? But I need to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me double-check.

If each van holds 5 people, then one van can take 5 people, another can take the next 5, and the third van can take the remaining 5. But wait, in this case, the total is exactly 15, which is 3 times 5. So, 3 vans would be sufficient.

But hold on, sometimes in these problems, there are other factors to consider, like the number of adults versus students or if there are any constraints about how many vans can be used or if some people need to be separated. But the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It just says each van can hold 5 people, and there are 12 students and 3 adults, making 15 people in total.

Therefore, the number of vans needed is 3.

Hmm, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that some people might not fit if, for example, the group is mixed? Like, if adults and students can't be in the same van or something. But the problem doesn't specify any such restrictions. It just says each van can hold 5 people, regardless of their age or status. So, I think it's safe to assume that all 15 can be transported in 3 vans without any issues.

So, I'm pretty confident now that the number of vans needed is 3.
</think>

To determine the number of vans needed, we first calculate the total number of people attending the field trip. There are 12 students and 3 adults, making a total of 15 people. Each van can accommodate up to 5 people. Dividing the total number of people by the capacity of each van gives us the required number of vans:

15 people ÷ 5 people per van = 3 vans.

                <think>
First, I need to determine the total number of sodas Tom purchased. He bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas, which adds up to 56 sodas in total.

Next, I should consider how the sodas are arranged in the fridge. The problem states that the fridge can hold 7 sodas on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, I need to divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.

So, I'll divide 56 by 7. 

56 divided by 7 equals 8. 

This means that Tom will need 8 shelves to store all his sodas.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Sodas:**
   
   Tom bought:
   - 4 regular sodas
   - 52 diet sodas

   **Total sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas = 4 + 52 = 56**

2. **Determine the Number of Sodas per Shelf:**
   
   Each shelf can hold **7 sodas**.

3. **Calculate the Number of Shelves Needed:**
   
   To find out how many shelves are required to hold all the sodas, divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.

   **Number of shelves = Total sodas ÷ Sodas per shelf = 56 ÷ 7 = 8**

                    question:
                     The school cafeteria : had 38 apples. If they used : 20 to ; make lunch for the ! students , and then bought ? 28 more, ! how many apples would they have? ? 
                 Okay, so I have this problem here about apples in the school cafeteria. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says the cafeteria had 38 apples. Then they used 20 apples to make lunch for the students. After that, they bought 28 more apples. The question is, how many apples would they have in total?

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. Initially, they have 38 apples. Then they use some of them. So I think I need to subtract the number of apples used from the initial amount. 

Wait, but then they buy more apples. So after using 20 apples, they have 38 minus 20. Let me calculate that. 38 minus 20 is 18. So after using 20 apples, they have 18 left. 

Then they bought 28 more apples. So now, adding those 28 to the remaining 18. Let me do that addition. 18 plus 28... 18 plus 20 is 38, and then plus 8 more is 46. So, 18 plus 28 equals 46.

Therefore, the total number of apples they have now is 46. 

Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. Starting with 38 apples, subtract 20 used, which gives 18. Then adding 28 more, so 18 plus 28 is indeed 46. Yep, that seems correct.

I don't see any other steps or complications here. It's a straightforward subtraction and addition problem. So the final answer should be 46 apples.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Luke can carry up to **4 trays** at a time.
   - He needs to pick up **20 trays** from one table.
   - He also needs to pick up **16 trays** from another table.
   - Determine the total number of trips Luke will make.

2. **Calculate Trips for Each Table Separately:**
   - **First Table:** 20 trays.
     - Since he can carry **4 trays** per trip, the number of trips is:
     \[
     \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ trips}
     \]
   - **Second Table:** 16 trays.
     - Similarly, the number of trips is:
     \[
     \frac{16}{4} = 4 \text{ trips}
     \]

3. **Total Trips:**
   - Add the trips from both tables:
   \[
   5 \text{ trips} + 4 \text{ trips} = 9 \text{ trips}

                 Okay, so I have this problem here about apples in the cafeteria. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says the cafeteria had 96 apples. They used 42 of them for lunch, handing out 42 to students. Then, they decided to use the rest to make pies. Each pie takes 6 apples. The question is, how many pies could they make?

Alright, let's break it down. So, starting with the total number of apples: 96. They used 42 for lunch. So, to find out how many apples are left for making pies, I need to subtract the 42 apples from the total.

So, 96 minus 42. Let me do that subtraction. 96 minus 40 would be 56, and then minus 2 more is 54. So, there are 54 apples left for making pies.

Now, each pie requires 6 apples. To find out how many pies they can make, I need to divide the remaining apples by the number of apples per pie. That would be 54 divided by 6.

Hmm, 54 divided by 6. Well, 6 times 9 is 54, so that means they can make 9 pies. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total apples: 96. Subtract the 42 used for lunch: 96 - 42 = 54. Then, each pie needs 6 apples, so 54 / 6 = 9 pies. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here.

Wait, let me think again. Sometimes when problems mention things like ""the rest,"" I should ensure I'm only using the leftover apples and not the initial ones or anything else. But in this case, the 42 apples are used for lunch, so the rest are definitely for pies. So, yeah, 54 apples for pies, which divided by 6 is 9. That should be correct.

I don't see any other steps involved here. The problem is straightforward: subtract the apples used, then divide by the number needed per pie. So, I think 9 is the right answer.
</think>

The cafeteria started with 96 apples. They used 42 for lunch, leaving 54 apples. Since each pie requires 6 apples, they can make 9 pies.

                 Okay, so Henry has 3 action figures, but he wants a complete collection of 8. Hmm, that means he needs more. Each action figure costs $6, so I guess I need to figure out how many more he needs to buy. Let me see. If he currently has 3 and needs 8 total, then the number of additional ones he needs is 8 minus 3. So that's 5 more. Each one is $6, so I multiply 5 by $6. Let me do that: 5 times 6 is 30. So he needs $30 more. But wait, the question is a bit confusing. It says ""needed ; 8 total for a , complete ? collection."" Maybe I misread that part. Let me check again. It seems like there are some missing words or maybe some punctuation issues. It says ""needed ; 8 total for a , complete ? collection."" Hmm, that part is a bit unclear. Maybe it's saying he needs 8 more to complete his collection? So if he has 3, he needs 5 more. So that still stands. Each costs $6, so 5 times $6 is $30. So the total amount he needs is $30. I think that's the answer.
</think>

Henry has 3 action figures and needs a complete collection of 8. Each action figure costs $6.

Step 1: Determine how many additional action figures Henry needs.
He needs \( 8 - 3 = 5 \) more action figures.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the additional action figures.
Each additional action figure costs $6, so \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) dollars.

Therefore, Henry needs \$30 to complete his collection.

                 {Wait, that was a bit confusing. Let me try to parse the question again. Hmm, the question is a bit muddled with all the question marks and exclamation points. Let me see...}

Alright, let me try to make sense of this problem. It seems like the question is about Frank and his savings. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question starts with ""Frank ? had saved up 3 dollars."" The ""?"" here might be a typo or missing information. Maybe it's supposed to say ""Frank had saved up 3 dollars."" That makes more sense. So, I'll assume that Frank has saved up 3 dollars.

Next, it says, ""If he received ? another 37 ; dollars for his allowance, how many ! 8 dollar ; toys could he buy?"" Again, there are a lot of question marks and exclamation points, which are probably typos. Maybe it's supposed to be ""received another 37 dollars"" and ""how many 8 dollar toys could he buy?"" That seems to make sense.

So, putting it all together, the problem is: Frank had saved up 3 dollars. If he received another 37 dollars for his allowance, how many 8 dollar toys could he buy?

Alright, now that I have a clearer picture, let's solve the problem.

First, let's figure out how much money Frank has in total. He initially saved 3 dollars. Then he received another 37 dollars. So, total money = 3 + 37 = 40 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how many 8 dollar toys he can buy with this total amount.

To find the number of toys, we'll divide the total money by the cost per toy.

Number of toys = total money / cost per toy
Number of toys = 40 / 8

Let me calculate that. 40 divided by 8 is 5. So, he can buy 5 toys.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

3 dollars saved + 37 dollars received = 40 dollars total.

Each toy costs 8 dollars. So, 40 divided by 8 equals 5. Yep, that's correct.

So, Frank can buy 5 toys.

I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.

- Frank starts with 3 dollars.
- He gets an additional 37 dollars.
- Total money: 3 + 37 = 40.
- Each toy costs 8 dollars.
- Number of toys = 40 / 8 = 5.

Yep, that all adds up. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. So, the answer should be 5 toys.
</think>

Frank had saved up 3 dollars. If he received another 37 dollars, he would have a total of 40 dollars. Each toy costs 8 dollars, so he can buy 5 toys.

                 Okay, so Vanessa and her mom are picking carrots from their garden. I need to figure out how many bad carrots they have. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the problem says Vanessa picked 17 carrots. Her mom picked 14. So together, how many carrots did they pick? Let me add those numbers. 17 plus 14 equals 31. So, they picked a total of 31 carrots.

Now, it says only 24 of the carrots were good. That means the rest are bad. So, to find the number of bad carrots, I should subtract the number of good carrots from the total picked. Let me calculate that. 31 minus 24 equals 7. So, are they saying there are 7 bad carrots?

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem mentions Vanessa and her mom picking carrots from their garden. It specifies how many each picked and then tells that only 24 were good. It doesn't mention anything about them discarding or not picking bad ones, so I think the 31 total includes both good and bad carrots.

Therefore, subtracting the good ones from the total gives the bad ones. So yes, 31 minus 24 is 7. So, the number of bad carrots is 7.

But wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing. It says ""how many bad carrots did they have?"" So, does that mean the total number of bad carrots in the garden, or just the ones they picked? Hmm. The problem says they were picking carrots from their garden, and only 24 were good. So I think it refers to the total number in the garden, not just what they picked. But wait, no, because the problem doesn't mention the total number in the garden. It only mentions the number they picked.

Wait, this is tricky. Let me re-read the question. ""Vanessa and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Vanessa picked 17 and her mother picked 14. If only 24 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?""

So, the question is about the bad carrots. It doesn't specify whether it's the ones they picked or the total in the garden. But since they were picking carrots, and only 24 were good, I think it's referring to the ones they picked because the total in the garden isn't specified.

Wait, but if they picked 31 carrots, and only 24 were good, then 7 are bad. So, the answer is 7. But let me think again. Maybe the 24 good carrots are the ones they picked, meaning that in their garden, all the carrots, only 24 were good, so 24 good and 7 bad, making a total of 31 carrots. So, yes, the bad ones are 7.

Wait, another angle: If the 24 good carrots are in the garden, then how many bad carrots are in the garden? But since Vanessa and her mom are picking carrots, maybe the 24 good ones are the ones they picked. So, they picked 31 carrots, 24 good, 7 bad. So, the number of bad carrots they have is 7.

Alternatively, if the 24 good carrots are in the garden, and the total number of carrots in the garden is something else, but the problem doesn't specify that. So, the only numbers given are the ones they picked: 17 and 14, totaling 31. Of those, 24 are good, so 7 are bad. Therefore, the answer is 7.

Wait, but the question says ""how many bad carrots did they have?"" So, maybe it's referring to the ones they have in their garden, not just the ones they picked. But the problem doesn't give the total number of carrots in the garden. It only tells us about the ones they picked. So, perhaps the question is only about the ones they picked.

Alternatively, maybe the 24 good carrots are the ones they picked, so the total picked is 31, so 31 minus 24 is 7 bad. So, the answer is 7.

I think that's the correct way to interpret it. So, the number of bad carrots they have is 7.
</think>

The total number of carrots picked by Vanessa and her mom is 17 + 14 = 31. Since only 24 of these carrots are good, the number of bad carrots is 31 - 24 = 7.

                 {The final answer is}
</think>

Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the situation is that there's a company picnic with 23 managers and 7 employees. They decide to play a volleyball game and split into 6 teams. The question is, how many people would be on each team?

First, I need to understand the total number of people attending the picnic. There are two groups: managers and employees. The managers are 23 in number, and the employees are 7. So, to find the total number of people, I should add these two numbers together.

Let me write that down:

Total number of people = Number of managers + Number of employees
Total number of people = 23 + 7

Hmm, 23 plus 7 is 30. So, there are 30 people in total at the picnic.

Now, they want to split these 30 people into 6 teams for the volleyball game. The question is asking how many people would be on each team. So, I need to divide the total number of people by the number of teams.

Let me write that calculation:

Number of people per team = Total number of people ÷ Number of teams
Number of people per team = 30 ÷ 6

Dividing 30 by 6 gives me 5. So, each team would have 5 people.

Wait, let me double-check that. If there are 6 teams and each has 5 people, then the total number of people should be 6 multiplied by 5.

Let me calculate that:

Total number of people = Number of teams × Number of people per team
Total number of people = 6 × 5
Total number of people = 30

Yes, that matches the total number of people we had earlier (23 managers + 7 employees = 30). So, that checks out.

So, each team would have 5 people.

                <think>
First, I need to determine the total amount of flour Tiffany used for the 8 brownies. Since she used 8 cups of flour for each brownie, the total flour used is 8 cups multiplied by 8 brownies, which equals 64 cups.

Next, I calculate the total amount of flour needed for the party. Tiffany requires 17 brownies in total, and each brownie uses 8 cups of flour. Therefore, the total flour needed is 17 multiplied by 8 cups, resulting in 136 cups.

Finally, to find out how much more flour Tiffany needs, I subtract the flour she already used (64 cups) from the total required (136 cups). This gives a difference of 72 cups.
</think>

**Solution:**

Tiffany baked 8 brownies and needs 17 in total for her party. Each brownie requires 8 cups of flour. Let's determine how much more flour she needs.

1. **Flour used for baked brownies:**
   
   \[
   8 \text{ cups/brownie} \times 8 \text{ brownies} = 64 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Total flour needed for 17 brownies:**
   
   \[
   8 \text{ cups/brownie} \times 17 \text{ brownies} = 136 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Flour still needed:**
   
   \[
   136 \text{ cups} - 64 \text{ cups} = 72 \text{ cups}

</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Carol picked **29 carrots**.
- Her mother picked **16 carrots**.
- Total **38 carrots** were good.

**To Find:**
- The number of **bad carrots** they had.

---

### Step 1: Determine the Total Carrots Picked
Carol picked 29 carrots, and her mother picked 16 carrots.

\[
\text{Total carrots picked} = 29 + 16 = 45
\]

---

### Step 2: Understand the Distribution of Good Carrots
Out of the total 45 carrots, **38** were good.

\[
\text{Good carrots} = 38
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Bad Carrots
Since the total carrots picked are 45 and 38 are good, the remaining carrots must be bad.

\[
\text{Bad carrots} = \text{Total carrots picked} - \text{Good carrots} = 45 - 38 = 7
\]

---

**Final Answer:**
They had **7 bad carrots**.

                <think>
To determine how many more problems the teacher needs to grade, I first need to find the total number of problems across all 17 worksheets. Since each worksheet has 7 problems, the total number of problems is 17 multiplied by 7.

Next, I identify how many problems the teacher has already graded. She has graded 8 worksheets, and each of those has 7 problems. Therefore, the total number of problems she has already graded is 8 multiplied by 7.

Finally, to find out how many more problems she needs to grade, I subtract the number of problems she has already graded from the total number of problems across all worksheets.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Each worksheet has **7 problems**.
- The teacher has **17 worksheets** to grade.
- The teacher has already graded **8 worksheets**.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of problems in all 17 worksheets.**
\[
\text{Total problems} = \text{Number of worksheets} \times \text{Problems per worksheet} = 17 \times 7 = 119
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of problems the teacher has already graded.**
\[
\text{Problems graded already} = \text{Number of graded worksheets} \times \text{Problems per worksheet} = 8 \times 7 = 56
\]

**Step 3: Determine the number of additional problems the teacher needs to grade.**
\[
\text{Problems remaining} = \text{Total problems} - \text{Problems graded already} = 119 - 56 = 63

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     There were 8 friends playing a ! video game online when ? 2 more players joined ! the ! game. If each player ? had 6 : lives, how many ! lives did . they have total? ? 
                 Okay, so I have this problem here about friends playing a video game. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, the problem says there were 8 friends playing the game. Then, 2 more players joined. So, I need to find the total number of lives they have after these two join. Each player had 6 lives. Hmm, okay.

Wait, let me make sure I understand the question correctly. It says each player had 6 lives. So, initially, there are 8 friends. Each of these 8 has 6 lives. So, to find the total lives initially, I can multiply the number of players by the number of lives per player. That would be 8 times 6.

Let me calculate that. 8 times 6 is 48. So, initially, they have 48 lives in total.

Then, 2 more players joined. So, now the total number of players is 8 plus 2, which is 10 players. Each of these new players also has 6 lives. So, I need to add 2 times 6 to the previous total.

Calculating that, 2 times 6 is 12. So, adding that to the initial 48 lives, we get 48 plus 12, which equals 60.

Wait, is there another way to think about it? Maybe. Alternatively, I could calculate the total lives after all players have joined. Since each player has 6 lives, regardless of when they joined, the total lives would just be the total number of players multiplied by 6.

So, 8 original players plus 2 new players make 10 players in total. 10 times 6 is 60. Yep, same result.

Is there a possibility I misread the question? Let me check again. It says 8 friends were playing, then 2 more joined. Each player had 6 lives. So, the initial 8 each had 6, then the 2 new ones also each had 6. So, total lives would be 8*6 + 2*6 = 48 + 12 = 60.

Alternatively, if the question had meant that each player had a certain number of lives depending on when they joined, like initial players had more lives and new ones had fewer, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says each player had 6 lives, so they all have the same amount.

Therefore, I think 60 is the correct total number of lives they have after the two new players joined.

Wait, another angle: sometimes in games, when players join, their lives might be added to the pool. But in this case, it's unclear. The problem doesn't specify any change in how lives are shared or used. It just says each player had 6 lives. So, each of the 10 players has 6 lives, regardless of when they joined.

So, the total is 10 times 6, which is 60. Yeah, that makes sense.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. The problem is straightforward: initial number of players, additional players, lives per player, calculate total lives. So, 8 + 2 is 10 players, 10 * 6 = 60 lives total.

I think that's solid. No need to complicate it further.
</think>

First, there are 8 friends playing the game, each with 6 lives. This gives an initial total of 8 × 6 = 48 lives.

When 2 more players join, the total number of players becomes 8 + 2 = 10. Each of these players also has 6 lives, so the total lives contributed by the new players are 2 × 6 = 12.

Adding the new players' lives to the initial total: 48 + 12 = 60.

Alternatively, calculating the total lives directly: 10 players × 6 lives = 60.

Thus, the total number of lives they have is 60.

                 Okay, so I need to figure out how many tickets Cody has after spending some and winning more. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Cody won 49 tickets at the ? arcade. I'm not sure what the ""?"" refers to, but maybe it's just a placeholder for information not needed. So, he starts with 49 tickets.

Then it says he spent 25 tickets on a beanie. Okay, so spending 25 tickets would mean subtracting that from his total. So, 49 minus 25. Let me do that math: 49 - 25 equals 24. So after spending, he has 24 tickets left.

Then later, he won 6 more tickets. So, he adds 6 tickets to his current amount. That would be 24 plus 6, which is 30.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through it again.

He starts with 49 tickets. He spends 25, so 49 - 25 is definitely 24. Then he wins 6 more, so 24 + 6 is 30. Yeah, that seems right.

Hmm, maybe the ""?"" is just there to confuse or maybe it's a typo. But the numbers make sense as they are. So I think the final answer is 30 tickets.

Cody starts with 49 tickets, spends 25 on a beanie, leaving him with 24. He then wins 6 more, resulting in a total of 30 tickets.

I need to determine how many candy piles Bianca can make after eating 30 pieces of candy.

First, I'll calculate the total number of candy pieces Bianca received, which is 78.

Next, I'll subtract the number of candies she ate, which is 30, to find the remaining candies. So, 78 minus 30 equals 48 candies left.

Finally, to find out how many piles she can make, I'll divide the remaining candies by the number of candies in each pile, which is 8. Therefore, 48 divided by 8 equals 6.

So, Bianca can make 6 piles of candy.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Total Candy Received:** Bianca received a total of **78** pieces of candy.

2. **Candies Eaten:** She ate **30** pieces of candy.

3. **Candies Left:** To find out how many candies Bianca has left after eating, subtract the candies eaten from the total received.
   
   \[
   78 \text{ (total)} - 30 \text{ (eaten)} = 48 \text{ (left)}
   \]

4. **Candies per Pile:** Each pile contains **8** pieces of candy.

5. **Number of Piles:** To find out how many piles Bianca can make, divide the remaining candies by the number of candies per pile.
   
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ (left)}}{8 \text{ (per pile)}} = 6 \text{ (piles)}

                 Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is about five friends playing an online video game. Then two more players joined, making the total number of players seven. Each player had eight lives, and we need to find out the total number of lives they have altogether.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. It mentions ""each player had 8 lives,"" which I think means that each of the players in the game had eight lives. So, each of the five friends had eight lives, and then when two more players joined, each of those two also had eight lives.

So, to find the total number of lives, I should calculate the number of lives each group of players had and then add them together.

Let me break it down step by step.

Initially, there are five friends playing the game. Each has eight lives. So, the total lives before the new players join would be 5 multiplied by 8. Let me calculate that: 5 times 8 is 40. So, initially, there are 40 lives.

Then, two more players join the game. Now, the total number of players is 5 plus 2, which equals 7. Each of these two new players also has eight lives. So, I need to add two more sets of eight lives. That would be 2 times 8, which is 16.

Now, I need to add the initial 40 lives to the 16 lives from the new players to find the total number of lives. So, 40 plus 16 equals 56.

Therefore, the total number of lives they have is 56.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, five friends, each with eight lives: 5 * 8 = 40. Two new players, each with eight lives: 2 * 8 = 16. Adding those together: 40 + 16 = 56. Yeah, that seems correct.

Is there another way to think about it? Maybe by considering the total number of players and then multiplying by eight. So, 5 + 2 equals 7 players. 7 * 8 equals 56. Yep, same result. That confirms that the total number of lives is 56.

So, I think that's the right answer.
</think>

Initially, there are 5 friends playing the game. Each has 8 lives, so the total lives initially are 5 × 8 = 40. When 2 more players join, the total number of players becomes 7. Each of these 7 players has 8 lives, so the total lives are 7 × 8 = 56.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Each adult meal costs $8.
- Kids eat for free.
- There are 11 people in the group.
- Out of these, 2 are kids.

**Step 1: Determine the number of adult meals needed.**
Since there are 11 people and 2 are kids, the number of adults is:
11 total people - 2 kids = 9 adults.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost for adult meals.**
Each adult meal costs $8, so:
9 adults × $8 per meal = $72.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for kids' meals.**
Kids eat for free, so there is no additional cost for the 2 kids.

**Step 4: Add the costs together to find the total expense.**
Total cost = Cost for adult meals + Cost for kids' meals
Total cost = $72 + $0 = $72.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Roger initially has **25 books**.
- He **sold 21 books**.
- He **used the money** from the sale to **buy 30 new books**.
- We need to find out how many books Roger has **after** these transactions.

**Step 1: Calculate the Number of Books Sold**
Roger sold **21 books**.

**Step 2: Determine the Money Earned from the Sale**
Since the problem doesn't provide information about the price per book or the total money earned, we'll assume that selling one book gives him **1 unit of money** (this is a common assumption to simplify the problem).

- **Money earned from selling 21 books** = 21 units.

**Step 3: Calculate the Total Money Roger Has After the Sale**
Initially, Roger had **25 books**. After selling **21**, he has:
- **25 - 21 = 4 books** remaining.

**Step 4: Use the Money to Buy New Books**
Roger uses the **21 units of money** to buy **30 new books**.

**Step 5: Determine the Total Number of Books Roger Has After the Purchase**
After buying **30 new books**, Roger's total number of books is:
- **Books remaining after sale + New books bought** = 4 + 30 = 34 books.

                 **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
First, let's identify the initial number of lives Wendy has. She starts with 10 lives.

Next, in the hard part of the game, Wendy loses 6 lives. To find out how many lives she has left after this loss, subtract 6 from her initial total.

After losing 6 lives, she has 10 minus 6, which equals 4 lives remaining.

Then, in the next level, Wendy gains 37 more lives. This means her total number of lives increases by 37.

To find the final number of lives, add the 37 lives she gained to her remaining 4 lives.

So, 4 plus 37 equals 41.

Therefore, after losing 6 lives and gaining 37 more, Wendy has 41 lives left.
</think>

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Initial Number of Lives:**  
Wendy starts with **10 lives**.

**Lives Lost in the Hard Part:**

Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the problem is about a school's baseball team having some new players and some returning players, and the coach wants to put them into groups with 6 players each. I need to find out how many groups there will be.

First, let me parse the information given:

- The team has **48! new players**.
- There are **? 6 returning players**.

Wait, that part seems a bit confusing. It says ""There , school's baseball team had 48 ! new players and ? 6 returning players."" Hmm, maybe there was a typo or formatting issue. Let me see if I can interpret it correctly.

It seems like the team has:

- **48! new players**.
- **6 returning players**.

I think the exclamation mark was meant to denote something else, like emphasis, not mathematical factorial. So, I'll proceed with:

- **48 new players**.
- **6 returning players**.

Now, the coach wants to put them into groups with **6 players in each group**. So, I need to find the total number of players first and then divide that by the number of players per group to get the number of groups.

Let's calculate the total number of players:

Total players = Number of new players + Number of returning players  
Total players = 48 + 6  
Total players = 54

Now, if each group has **6 players**, then the number of groups can be found by dividing the total number of players by the number of players per group.

Number of groups = Total players / Players per group  
Number of groups = 54 / 6  
Number of groups = 9

So, the coach would need to form **9 groups**.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Total players: 48 new + 6 returning = 54 total.
2. Dividing by players per group: 54 / 6 = 9 groups.

That seems correct. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.

                 Okay, so Nancy had 80 question mark files on her computer. She deleted 31 of them, so that leaves her with 80 minus 31, which is 49 files. Then she put the rest into folders with 7 files each. Hmm, so how many folders does she need? Well, if she has 49 files and each folder holds 7, I think I need to divide 49 by 7. Let me do that: 49 divided by 7 is 7. So, she would have 7 folders. Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. 7 folders times 7 files each is 49 files. Yes, that adds up. So, the answer should be 7 folders. But wait, the question had some strange symbols, like exclamation marks and question marks. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me go through it again.

Nancy had 80 ? files on her ! computer. She deleted 31 of them : and put the rest into folders with 7 files in each one. How many ; folders did Nancy end up with?

Hmm, the punctuation is a bit confusing. Maybe the question marks and exclamation marks are just typos or placeholders. I'll treat them as part of the sentence structure and ignore them for the math. So, Nancy started with 80 files, deleted 31, so 49 left. Then divided into folders of 7 each. 49 divided by 7 is 7. So, 7 folders. That seems straightforward. I don't think I'm missing anything here. There's no mention of leftover files or anything, so 7 should be the correct answer.

Nancy started with 80 files, deleted 31, leaving her with 49. Dividing 49 by 7 gives 7 folders.

                    question:
                     , Luke was ? selling his old games. ? He started : out , with 39 ? but sold 19 of them. He packed ? the rest up putting 4 games into each , box. How many , boxes did he ? have to . use? 
                 Okay, so I have this problem here: Luke was selling his old games. He started with 39 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 4 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use?

Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, I need to figure out how many games Luke has left after selling 19. He started with 39, so subtracting the 19 he sold, that should give me the number of games he has left. Let me write that down.

39 total games - 19 sold = 20 remaining games.

Okay, so he has 20 games left to pack. Now, each box holds 4 games. I need to find out how many boxes he needs to use to pack all 20 games. That sounds like a division problem. Let me calculate that.

Number of boxes = Total remaining games / Games per box
Number of boxes = 20 / 4

Hmm, dividing 20 by 4. Well, 4 goes into 20 five times because 4 times 5 is 20. So, 20 divided by 4 is 5. Therefore, he needs 5 boxes.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 39, selling 19, that's 39 minus 19, which is 20. Each box holds 4 games, so 20 divided by 4 is 5. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think there's any trick here, like needing an extra box or something. It's straightforward division. So, yeah, he needs 5 boxes.
</think>

Luke started with 39 games, sold 19, leaving him with 20. Each box holds 4 games, so he needs 5 boxes.

                <think>
First, there are 65 students trying out for the trivia team.

17 students were not selected, so the number of students picked is 65 minus 17, which equals 48.

These 48 students are divided into 8 groups.

To find the number of students in each group, I divide the total number of students picked by the number of groups.

So, 48 divided by 8 equals 6.

Therefore, there are 6 students in each group.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Total Students Trying Out:**  
   There are **65** students trying out for the trivia team.

2. **Students Not Selected:**  
   **17** students didn't get picked for the team.

3. **Students Selected:**  
   To find out how many students were selected:
   \[
   65 \text{ (total)} - 17 \text{ (not selected)} = 48 \text{ (selected)}

I need to determine how many pictures were in each album that Isabel created.

Isabel uploaded 25 pictures to Facebook. She placed 10 pictures into one album. The remaining pictures will be distributed into 5 different albums.

To find out how many pictures are in each of the 5 different albums, I'll divide the remaining 15 pictures by 5.

15 divided by 5 equals 3.

Therefore, each of the 5 different albums will have 3 pictures.
</think>

**Solution:**

Isabel uploaded a total of **25 pictures** to Facebook. She organized them into albums as follows:

1. **First Album:**  
   - She placed **10 pictures** into one album.

                    question:
                     Mike made 14 dollars ! mowing ; lawns and 26 ! dollars : weed eating. If he only ? spent 5 dollar a week, ? how ? long would the money : last him? 
                 Okay, so Mike has earned a total of 14 dollars from mowing lawns and 26 dollars from weed eating. So first, I should figure out how much money Mike has in total. Let me add those two amounts together.

Hmm, 14 plus 26. Let me do that step by step. 14 plus 20 is 34, and then adding the remaining 6 makes it 40. So Mike has 40 dollars in total.

Now, the question is asking how long his money will last if he spends 5 dollars each week. To find out how long the money will last, I need to divide the total amount of money Mike has by the weekly spending amount.

So, 40 dollars divided by 5 dollars per week. Let me calculate that. 5 goes into 40 eight times because 5 multiplied by 8 is 40. So, the money should last Mike for 8 weeks.

Wait, let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Adding 14 and 26 again: 14 plus 20 is 34, plus 6 is 40. Yep, that's correct. And 40 divided by 5 is indeed 8. So, Mike's money will last him for 8 weeks.
</think>

Mike earned a total of \$14 from mowing lawns and \$26 from weed eating. 

1. **Total Earnings:**
   \[
   \$14 + \$26 = \$40

2. **Weekly Spending:**
   Mike spends \$5 each week.

3. **Duration of Money:**
   To find out how long \$40 will last, divide the total earnings by the weekly spending:

                 Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Gwen took 41 pictures at the zoo and 29 at the museum. Then she deleted 15 of them. I need to find out how many pictures she still has.

First, I should find out the total number of pictures she took. That would be the sum of the pictures at the zoo and the museum. So, 41 plus 29. Let me do that addition: 41 + 29 equals... hmm, 70. Yeah, 41 plus 29 is 70. So she took 70 pictures in total.

Then, she deleted 15 pictures. So, to find out how many she has left, I need to subtract the 15 deleted pictures from the total. That would be 70 minus 15. Let me calculate that: 70 minus 10 is 60, and then minus 5 more is 55. So, 70 - 15 equals 55. 

Therefore, after deleting 15 pictures, Gwen still has 55 pictures left. I think that's it. She started with 70 and got rid of 15, so 55 remain.
</think>

Gwen took a total of 41 pictures at the zoo and 29 at the museum. To find out how many pictures she took in total, we add these two numbers together:

\[ 41 + 29 = 70 \]

Next, she deleted 15 pictures. To determine how many pictures she still has, we subtract the deleted pictures from the total:

\[ 70 - 15 = 55 \]

Therefore, Gwen still has 55 pictures from her vacation.

                 Okay, so I need to figure out how long it will take for all the puppies at this pet shelter to be adopted if 4 puppies are adopted each day. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says the shelter had 2 puppies and then another 34 were brought in. So, I should add those together to find the total number of puppies. That would be 2 plus 34, which equals 36 puppies in total.

Now, if 4 puppies are adopted each day, I need to determine how many days it will take to adopt all 36 puppies. To do that, I can divide the total number of puppies by the number adopted each day. So, 36 divided by 4 equals 9. That means it will take 9 days to adopt all the puppies.

Wait, let me double-check. If we adopt 4 puppies a day, on day 1, we have 36-4=32 left. Day 2: 32-4=28. Day 3: 28-4=24. Day 4: 24-4=20. Day 5: 20-4=16. Day 6: 16-4=12. Day 7: 12-4=8. Day 8: 8-4=4. Day 9: 4-4=0. Yep, that's 9 days in total. So, my initial calculation was correct.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
A pet shelter initially had 2 puppies. Then, another 34 puppies were brought in. If 4 puppies are adopted each day, how long will it take for all of them to be adopted?

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of puppies:**
   
   - Initial puppies = 2
   - Additional puppies brought in = 34
   - Total puppies = 2 + 34 = 36

2. **Determine the number of days required to adopt all puppies:**

                 Hey, let me try to figure this out. So, Victor bought some adventure books and some mystery books from the school's book fair. He bought 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books. Then, he used 16 of the mystery books. The question is asking how many new books he bought. Hmm, wait, does that mean he bought more books after that? Or is it referring to the total number of books he bought initially?

Wait, maybe I need to clarify the problem first. So, Victor bought 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books. Then, he used 16 of the mystery books. The question is about the number of new books he bought. Hmm, ""new"" might mean he bought additional books after using some. But the problem doesn't mention him buying more books after using the 16. It just says he bought 32 and 37 initially.

Wait, maybe ""new"" refers to the total number of books he bought, not necessarily new in the sense of additional. But that doesn't quite make sense because he bought them all at once. Alternatively, maybe ""new"" is a typo or mistranslation. Alternatively, perhaps ""how many new books did he buy"" is referring to the total number he purchased initially, but that seems odd because he bought 32 and 37.

Wait, maybe ""new"" is a mistranslation and the intended question is how many books did he buy in total? So, 32 plus 37 is 69. But the problem mentions he used 16 mystery books. So, perhaps the question is about how many new books he bought after using some. But the problem doesn't state he bought more. It just says he bought 32 and 37, then used 16 of the mystery ones. So, maybe the total number he bought is 69. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking how many new books he had left after using 16. But that's not what's being asked. The question is specifically about the number of new books he bought, not how many he used or had left.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is straightforward: he bought 32 adventure and 37 mystery. Then, he used 16 mystery books. So, the total number he bought is 32 + 37 = 69. But the question is how many new books he bought. Wait, ""new"" might mean in addition to the ones he used. But he didn't buy any new ones after using the 16. So maybe the answer is 69.

Alternatively, perhaps ""new"" refers to the total number of books, which would be 32 + 37 = 69. So, he bought 69 new books in total.

Wait, but maybe the problem is saying he bought 32 adventure and 37 mystery, then used 16 mystery, so how many new books did he buy? Maybe the problem is implying he bought the 37 mystery books, and 16 were used, so he bought 37 - 16 = 21 new mystery books. But then he also bought 32 adventure books, which are all new. So total new books would be 32 + 21 = 53.

Wait, that seems plausible. So, he bought 32 adventure books, all of which are new. Then, he bought 37 mystery books, used 16, so he has 37 - 16 = 21 new mystery books. So total new books he bought would be 32 + 21 = 53.

But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe ""new"" refers to the total number of books, regardless of type. So, 32 + 37 = 69. But the problem mentions using 16 mystery books, so maybe the question is trying to say that he bought some books, used some, and then bought more. But the problem doesn't mention buying more after using 16. It just says he bought 32 and 37 initially.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in another language, and ""new"" is a translation issue. Maybe it's asking how many books he bought in total, which is 32 + 37 = 69. Alternatively, maybe ""new"" is referring to the total number after using some, but that doesn't make sense because he bought them all at once.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking how many new books he had left after using 16, but that's not what's being asked. The question is about how many new books he bought, so maybe it's 69.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to rephrase the problem.

</think>
Alright, let's see. Maria picked 48 carrots from her garden. Then she threw out 11 of them. Okay, so first, I need to figure out how many carrots she has left after throwing out 11. Hmm, 48 minus 11 should give me that.

So, 48 minus 11 is... let me do the math. 48 minus 10 is 38, and then minus 1 more is 37. So, she has 37 carrots left.

Then, the next day, she picked 15 more carrots. So, I need to add those 15 to the remaining 37. Let's see, 37 plus 15. 37 plus 10 is 47, and then plus 5 more is 52. So, adding those together gives me 52.

Wait, does that make sense? She started with 48, threw out 11, so 37 left. Then she picked 15 more, so 37 plus 15 is 52. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I missed anything here. It's straightforward subtraction and addition. So, the total number of carrots she has is 52.
</think>

Maria initially picked 48 carrots. She threw out 11 of them, leaving her with:

48 - 11 = 37 carrots.

The next day, she picked 15 more carrots, so the total number of carrots she has is:

37 + 15 = 52 carrots.

                 Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many roses the florist has after selling some and then picking more. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the problem says: ""A florist had 50 roses. If she sold 15 of them and then later picked 21 more, how many roses would she have?"" Hmm, wait a minute. The way it's phrased is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

""A ? florist had 50 roses. If she sold 15 of them and then later picked ? 21 ! more, how many roses would she have?"" Oh, okay, I see. There are some missing words or parts here. It seems like the original problem was cut off or something. The parts marked with question marks are missing. I need to figure out what those missing parts are.

Let me parse the sentence again: ""A ? florist had 50 roses. If she sold 15 of them and then later picked ? 21 ! more, how many roses would she have?"" So, the first missing word is between ""A"" and ""florist""—probably the article or a word like ""the"" or ""a."" Then, after ""picked,"" there's another missing word before ""21""—maybe ""more"" or something like that. Also, there's an exclamation mark after ""21,"" which seems out of place. Maybe it's a typo.

Assuming that the florist started with 50 roses. She sold 15 of them. Then, she picked 21 more. Wait, but the way it's phrased is confusing. Let me try to represent it as equations.

Let me denote the number of roses she had at the beginning as R, which is given as 50. So R = 50.

She sold 15 roses. So after selling, she has R - 15 roses left.

Then, she picked 21 more roses. So after picking, she has (R - 15) + 21 roses.

So the total number of roses she has at the end is (50 - 15) + 21.

Calculating that: 50 - 15 is 35, plus 21 is 56.

Wait, but the problem mentions ""A ? florist"" and ""picked ? 21 ! more."" So, perhaps the missing parts were numbers? Maybe the initial number of roses isn't 50, but something else? Or maybe the numbers are different.

Wait, let me read the problem again. It says: ""A ? florist had 50 roses. If she sold 15 of them and then later picked ? 21 ! more, how many roses would she have?"" So the first ? is probably an article, like ""the"" or ""a."" But in the problem statement, it's between ""A"" and ""florist."" So, maybe it's ""A the florist..."" which doesn't make sense. Or ""A ? florist""—maybe ""A 2 florist,"" but that doesn't make sense either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem was cut off. Maybe it's supposed to be ""A florist had 50 roses. If she sold 15 of them and then later picked 21 more, how many roses would she have?"" But in the original, it's ""picked ? 21 ! more."" So, the missing part is probably ""21"" or ""more."" Wait, no, the ""21"" is there, but the part before it is missing.

Wait, maybe the problem was intended to have more words, like ""picked 21 more."" But the way it's written is ""picked ? 21 ! more."" So, the ? is replacing ""picked"" or ""more."" Hmm, maybe the ""picked"" is missing. Or maybe the ""more"" is missing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is: ""A florist had 50 roses. If she sold 15 of them and then later picked 21 more, how many roses would she have?"" But in the problem given, the ""picked ? 21 ! more,"" so the ? is replacing ""21"" or ""more."" Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers are different. Maybe the initial number is different, or the sold and picked numbers are different. But the problem as given is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is: ""A florist had 50 roses. If she sold 15 of them and then later picked 21 more, how many roses would she have?"" So, perhaps the problem has some typos with the question marks and exclamation marks. Maybe the intended problem is as I just wrote.

</think>

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many problems Isabel had to complete in total.

**Step 1: Identify the number of pages for each type of homework.**
- **Math homework:** 2 pages
- **Reading homework:** 4 pages

**Step 2: Determine the number of problems per page for each type of homework.**
- **Math homework:** 5 problems per page
- **Reading homework:** 5 problems per page

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of problems for each type of homework.**
- **Math problems:** 2 pages × 5 problems/page = 10 problems

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
First, there are initially 4 friends playing the video game.

When 5 more players join, the total number of players becomes 4 + 5 = 9.

Each player has 3 lives.

To find the total number of lives, multiply the number of players by the number of lives per player: 9 × 3 = 27.

Therefore, the total number of lives they have is 27.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Initial Number of Players:**
   
   There are **4 friends** playing the video game initially.

2. **Additional Players Join:**
   
   **5 more players** join the game.

3. **Total Number of Players:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total players} = \text{Initial players} + \text{Additional players} = 4 + 5 = 9

</think>
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how many problems Katie has to complete in total. Hmm, the problem says she has some pages of math homework and some pages of reading homework. Each page has 9 problems. So, I guess I need to find out how many pages she has in total for both types of homework and then multiply that by 9 to get the total number of problems.

First, let me break it down. She has 7 pages of math homework. So, for math, each page has 9 problems. That means for math alone, she has 7 times 9 problems. Let me calculate that: 7 multiplied by 9 is 63. So, 63 problems for math.

Next, she also has 3 pages of reading homework. Since each page also has 9 problems, I need to calculate the number of problems for reading as well. So, 3 pages times 9 problems per page. That would be 3 times 9, which is 27. So, 27 problems for reading.

Now, to find the total number of problems, I need to add the math problems and the reading problems together. So, that's 63 problems from math plus 27 problems from reading. Let me add those together: 63 plus 27 equals 90.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 7 pages times 9 is 63, and 3 pages times 9 is 27. Adding those gives 90. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think there's anything else to consider here. The problem doesn't mention any other pages or different numbers of problems per page, so I think 90 is the correct total number of problems.
</think>

Katie has 7 pages of math homework and 3 pages of reading homework. Each page has 9 problems.

1. Calculate the number of problems for math homework:
   7 pages × 9 problems/page = 63 problems.

2. Calculate the number of problems for reading homework:
   3 pages × 9 problems/page = 27 problems.

3. Add the problems from both types of homework:

                    question:
                     , While shopping for music , online, Janet bought 6 country albums , and 2 pop albums. Each , album came with a lyric sheet ! and had 9 , songs. How , many songs ; did ! Janet ; buy total? 
                 Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Janet went shopping for music online and bought some albums. Specifically, she bought 6 country albums and 2 pop albums. Each album comes with a lyric sheet, and each has 9 songs. The question is asking how many songs Janet bought in total.

First, I need to figure out how many albums Janet purchased. She bought 6 country albums and 2 pop albums. So, that would be 6 plus 2, which equals 8 albums in total.

Now, each album has 9 songs, and each album comes with a lyric sheet. Wait, does the lyric sheet count as an additional item or is it just part of the album? The problem says each album came with a lyric sheet, so I assume each album includes the 9 songs plus the lyric sheet. But the question is about the number of songs, not the lyric sheets. So, the lyric sheets might not affect the count of songs.

Therefore, I should focus on calculating the total number of songs. Since each album has 9 songs, I can multiply the number of albums by 9 to get the total number of songs.

She bought 8 albums in total, so 8 albums multiplied by 9 songs per album would give the total number of songs. Let me do the math: 8 times 9 equals 72. So, that would be 72 songs in total.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. She bought 6 country albums and 2 pop albums. Each has 9 songs. So, country albums contribute 6 times 9, which is 54 songs, and pop albums contribute 2 times 9, which is 18 songs. Adding those together, 54 plus 18 equals 72 songs. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation.

I also need to consider whether the lyric sheets add any value to the song count. Since each album comes with a lyric sheet, but the question is specifically about songs, it's safe to ignore the lyric sheets when calculating the total number of songs.

So, to recap: 6 country albums x 9 songs = 54 songs; 2 pop albums x 9 songs = 18 songs; 54 + 18 = 72 songs total. That seems straightforward.

I don't think there are any other factors to consider here. The problem doesn't mention any bonuses or penalties for certain types of albums, nor does it mention any albums without songs or additional songs. So, it's a simple multiplication and addition problem.

Another way to think about it is to consider the total number of albums first. 6 + 2 = 8 albums. Then, 8 albums x 9 songs per album = 72 songs. This method also leads to the same conclusion.

Therefore, I'm confident that the total number of songs Janet bought is 72.
</think>

Janet bought 6 country albums and 2 pop albums. Each album contains 9 songs. 

First, calculate the number of songs from country albums: 6 × 9 = 54 songs.

Next, calculate the number of songs from pop albums: 2 × 9 = 18 songs.

Add the two results to find the total number of songs: 54 + 18 = 72 songs.

First, I need to determine how many weeks Jerry's money will last based on his weekly spending.

Jerry has \$14 from mowing lawns and \$31 from weed eating, making a total of \$45.

He spends \$5 each week.

To find out how many weeks his \$45 will last, I divide the total amount by the weekly expenditure: 45 ÷ 5 = 9 weeks.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Total Earnings:**
   - **Mowing Lawns:** \$14
   - **Weed Eating:** \$31
   - **Total Earnings = \$14 + \$31 = \$45**

2. **Determine Weekly Expenditure:**
   - **Jerry spends \$5 per week.**

3. **Find Out How Long the Money Will Last:**
   - **Total Weeks = Total Earnings ÷ Weekly Expenditure**
   - **Total Weeks = \$45 ÷ \$5 = 9 weeks**

</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Adam originally has **33 books**.
- He sells **11 books**.
- He uses the money earned from selling to buy **23 new books**.
- We need to find out how many books Adam has after these transactions.

**Step 1: Calculate the money earned from selling 11 books.**
Assume the price per book is **\$1** for simplicity.
- Money earned = 11 books × \$1/book = **\$11**.

**Step 2: Subtract the money spent on buying new books.**
- Total money spent = 23 books × \$1/book = **\$23**.
- Remaining money = \$11 - \$23 = **\-\$12**.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of books after the transactions.**
- Original books = 33 books.
- Books sold = 11 books.
- Books bought = 23 books.
- Net change in books = 33 - 11 + 23 = **45 books**.

**Conclusion:**
Adam has **45 books** after selling 11 and buying 23 new books.

                <think>
First, I need to determine how many cans Kaleb collected on Saturday. He filled 5 bags, and each bag contains 4 cans. So, the total cans from Saturday are 5 bags multiplied by 4 cans per bag, which equals 20 cans.

Next, on Sunday, Kaleb filled another 5 bags. Using the same calculation, the total cans from Sunday are also 5 bags multiplied by 4 cans per bag, resulting in 20 cans.

Finally, to find the total number of cans collected over the weekend, I add the cans from both days: 20 cans from Saturday plus 20 cans from Sunday equals a total of 40 cans.

**Problem Statement:**
Kaleb was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday, he filled 5 bags, and on Sunday, he filled 5 more bags. If each bag had 4 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up in total?

---

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Cans Collected on Saturday:**
   - **Number of bags on Saturday:** 5
   - **Cans per bag:** 4
   - **Total cans on Saturday:** \( 5 \text{ bags} \times 4 \text{ cans/bag} = 20 \text{ cans} \)

2. **Cans Collected on Sunday:**
   - **Number of bags on Sunday:** 5
   - **Cans per bag:** 4
   - **Total cans on Sunday:** \( 5 \text{ bags} \times 4 \text{ cans/bag} = 20 \text{ cans} \)

3. **Total Cans Collected:**
   - **Cans on Saturday:** 20

                    question:
                     Nancy , was ? organizing : her book case making sure each : of the shelves , had ; exactly : 6 ; books on it. If she had ! 2 shelves of . mystery books and 6 shelves of picture ; books, how many books did she , have total? 
                 Okay, let's try to figure this out. Hmm, so Nancy is organizing her book case. She wants each shelf to have exactly 6 books. She has two types of books: mystery books and picture books. She has 2 shelves of mystery books and 6 shelves of picture books. I need to find out the total number of books she has.

First, let me break it down. She has two categories: mystery and picture. Each category is organized on separate shelves. For the mystery books, she has 2 shelves, each holding exactly 6 books. So, how many mystery books are there? Well, if each shelf has 6, then 2 shelves would have 6 times 2, which is 12. So, 12 mystery books.

Next, the picture books. She has 6 shelves, and each shelf also has exactly 6 books. So, similar to the mystery books, the number of picture books would be 6 times 6, which is 36. So, 36 picture books.

Now, to find the total number of books, I just need to add the mystery and picture books together. So, 12 plus 36. Let me do that calculation. 12 plus 36 is 48. So, Nancy has a total of 48 books.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. She has 2 shelves with 6 books each for mysteries: 2 times 6 is 12. 6 shelves with 6 books each for pictures: 6 times 6 is 36. Adding them gives 12 plus 36, which is indeed 48. Yep, that seems correct.
</think>

Nancy has 2 shelves of mystery books, each with 6 books, totaling 12 mystery books. She also has 6 shelves of picture books, each with 6 books, totaling 36 picture books. Adding them together gives 48 books in total.

{The final answer is 48}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",48,48.0,48.0

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Paul had saved up 3 dollars. If , he . received another ? 7 dollars for his allowance, : how many 5 dollar toys , could ; he buy? ? 
                 Okay, let's see. Paul has saved up 3 dollars. He received another 7 dollars for his allowance. So first, I need to figure out how much money Paul has in total now.

Hmm, so he had 3 dollars, and then he got 7 more. So that would be 3 plus 7. Let me add those together. 3 plus 7 is 10. So Paul has a total of 10 dollars.

Now, the question is how many 5 dollar toys can he buy with that money. Each toy costs 5 dollars, so I need to see how many times 5 fits into 10. That would be 10 divided by 5, which is 2. So he can buy 2 toys.

Wait, let me double-check. If he buys 2 toys, that's 2 times 5, which is 10 dollars. He has exactly that amount, so he can buy exactly 2 toys without any money left over. That seems right.

I don't think I missed anything. The problem didn't mention any other costs or taxes or anything like that. It's straightforward: total money minus cost per toy equals number of toys he can buy. So yeah, 2 toys.
</think>

Paul initially saved $3. He then received an additional $7, bringing his total savings to $3 + $7 = $10.

To determine how many $5 toys he can buy, divide the total savings by the cost per toy:
$10 ÷ $5 = 2.

Therefore, Paul can buy \boxed{2} toys.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",2,2.0,2.0

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
I start by determining the total number of files Katie had initially, which is 85.

Next, she deleted 40 files. To find out how many files she has left, I subtract the deleted files from the total: 85 - 40 = 45 files remaining.

Katie then organizes the remaining 45 files into folders, with each folder containing 5 files. To find out how many folders she needs, I divide the number of remaining files by the number of files per folder: 45 ÷ 5 = 9 folders.

Therefore, Katie ends up with 9 folders.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total files initially = 85
- Files deleted = 40
- Files remaining = Total files - Deleted files = 85 - 40 = 45
- Files per folder = 5

**Calculation:**
- Number of folders needed = Remaining files ÷ Files per folder = 45 ÷ 5 = 9

**Answer:**

                    question:
                     . Will was , working , as a ; sacker at a grocery store where , he made 8 dollars : an hour. On Monday he worked 8 hours and ! on Tuesday he worked ; 2 hours. How much ! money did Will make . in : those two days? : 
                 . Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Will made in those two days. Hmm, let me break this down. First, I know that Will's hourly wage is $8. So, he makes $8 for every hour he works. 

Alright, on Monday, he worked 8 hours. To find out how much he made that day, I can multiply his hourly rate by the number of hours he worked. So, 8 hours multiplied by $8 per hour. Let me write that out: 8 * 8 = 64. So, he made $64 on Monday.

Now, moving on to Tuesday. He worked 2 hours that day. Using the same hourly rate, I'll calculate his earnings for Tuesday. That would be 2 hours multiplied by $8 per hour. So, 2 * 8 = 16. Therefore, Will made $16 on Tuesday.

To find the total amount he made over both days, I need to add the earnings from Monday and Tuesday together. So, $64 from Monday plus $16 from Tuesday equals $80. 

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. On Monday: 8 hours * $8 = $64. That seems right. On Tuesday: 2 hours * $8 = $16. Adding them together: 64 + 16 = 80. Yep, that adds up correctly. So, Will made a total of $80 over those two days.
</think>

Will made a total of $80 in those two days.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Determine the hourly wage:** Will earns $8 for each hour he works.

2. **Calculate Monday's earnings:**
   - Hours worked on Monday: 8 hours
   - Earnings = 8 hours * $8/hour = $64

3. **Calculate Tuesday's earnings:**
   - Hours worked on Tuesday: 2 hours
   - Earnings = 2 hours * $8/hour = $16

4. **Find the total earnings for both days:**
   - Total earnings = Monday's earnings + Tuesday's earnings
   - Total earnings = $64 + $16 = $80

                    question:

                 Okay, so I've got this problem here about Oliver helping the librarian at the library. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, I'll read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, the problem says: ""Oliver is . at ; the library helping put ! away books. ; There are : 46 book to put away ? total but a ; librarian ? takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with ? the : rest. , If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, ; how many shelves ? will he , need?""

Hmm, the problem seems a bit jumbled with all the punctuation and missing words. Maybe the punctuation got messed up when it was sent. Let me try to parse it properly.

Breaking it down:

- ""Oliver is . at ; the library helping put ! away books."" So, Oliver is at the library, helping put books away. The punctuation is probably just extra, so the important part is that he's helping to put books away.

- ""There are : 46 book to put away ? total but a ; librarian ? takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with ? the : rest."" Okay, so there are 46 books in total. A librarian takes 10 of them, leaving Oliver with the rest. So, the librarian takes 10, and Oliver has the remaining.

- ""If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, ; how many shelves ? will he , need?"" So, Oliver can fit 4 books on each shelf, and we need to find how many shelves he will need.

Alright, so the problem is about dividing 46 books between the librarian and Oliver. The librarian takes 10, so Oliver is left with 46 - 10 = 36 books. Then, we need to figure out how many shelves Oliver needs if he can put 4 books on each shelf.

Let me write that down:

Total books = 46
Librarian takes 10, so Oliver has 46 - 10 = 36 books left.

Number of books per shelf = 4
Number of shelves needed = total books / books per shelf

So, 36 books divided by 4 per shelf is 9 shelves. So, he will need 9 shelves.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Total books: 46
Librarian takes 10, so 46 - 10 = 36.

Each shelf holds 4 books, so 36 ÷ 4 = 9.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 9 shelves.

But let me make sure I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem mentions the librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. So, the rest would be 46 - 10 = 36. Then, Oliver is putting away those 36 books, 4 on each shelf. So, 36 ÷ 4 = 9.

Yes, that seems right. I don't see any trick or hidden details here. It's straightforward division after subtracting the books the librarian took.

I think that's all. So, the final answer is 9 shelves.
</think>

Oliver helps put away books. There are 46 total. A librarian takes 10, leaving 36 for Oliver. He can fit 4 on a shelf. So, 36 ÷ 4 = 9 shelves needed.

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Problem:**
Luke was putting his spare change into piles. He had 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes. If each pile had 3 coins in it, how many coins did he have in total?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Given Information:**

   - Total quarters = 5 × 3 = 15

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Dimes:**
   - Each pile of dimes has 3 coins.
   - Total dimes = Number of piles × Coins per pile
   - Total dimes = 5 × 3 = 15

</think>
Alright, so I've got this problem here that I need to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step to understand what's going on.

First, the problem is about Gwen and her friends recycling paper for their class. The question is asking how many points they earned based on the recycling. From what I gather, for every 3 pounds of paper recycled, they earn one point. So, the key here is to figure out the total pounds recycled by both Gwen and her friends and then see how many points that equals.

Let me start by identifying the given information. It says that Gwen recycled 5 pounds. Her friends recycled 13 pounds. So, together, they recycled 5 + 13 pounds. Let me write that down.

Gwen's recycled paper: 5 pounds  
Friends' recycled paper: 13 pounds  
Total recycled paper = 5 + 13 = 18 pounds

Okay, so together they recycled 18 pounds of paper. Now, the problem mentions that for every 3 pounds recycled, they earn one point. So, I need to find out how many points 18 pounds would earn them.

To do this, I can set up a ratio or a conversion factor. Since 3 pounds equals 1 point, I can find out how many points are in 18 pounds by dividing the total pounds by the pounds per point.

So, points earned = total pounds / pounds per point  
Points earned = 18 pounds / 3 pounds per point

Let me calculate that. 18 divided by 3 is 6. So, 18 pounds would earn them 6 points.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, if they recycled 3 pounds, they get 1 point. So, 3 pounds = 1 point. Therefore, 1 pound would get them 1/3 of a point. So, 5 pounds would be 5 * (1/3) = 5/3 points, which is approximately 1.666 points, and 13 pounds would be 13 * (1/3) ≈ 4.333 points. Adding those together, 1.666 + 4.333 is approximately 6 points. So that checks out.

Another way to think about it is to see how many groups of 3 pounds are in 18 pounds. Since 18 divided by 3 is 6, that means they have 6 complete groups of 3 pounds. Each group gives 1 point, so 6 groups give 6 points.

I think that's solid. So, the total points earned would be 6.
</think>

Gwen recycled 5 pounds, and her friends recycled 13 pounds. Together, they recycled 18 pounds. Since they earn 1 point for every 3 pounds recycled, the total points earned are 18 divided by 3, which equals 6 points.

{The final answer is} 6 points.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",6,6.0,6.0

                 Okay, so I need to figure out how much Haley spent. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, Haley's favorite band is holding a concert, and the tickets are $4 each. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends, and then 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. I need to find out the total amount she spent.

Alright, so let me break it down. She bought two batches of tickets: the first batch was for herself and her friends, and the second batch was extra in case others wanted to join.

In the first batch, she bought 3 tickets. Since each ticket is $4, I can calculate the cost of the first batch by multiplying the number of tickets by the price per ticket.

So, 3 tickets times $4 per ticket equals... let me do that math. 3 times 4 is 12. So, the first batch cost her $12.

Next, she bought 5 extra tickets. Again, each ticket is $4, so I need to multiply 5 by $4. 5 times 4 is 20. So, the extra tickets cost her $20.

Now, to find the total amount she spent, I should add the cost of the first batch and the extra tickets together.

So, $12 plus $20 equals... $32. Therefore, Haley spent a total of $32.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. She bought 3 tickets at $4 each, so 3*4 is indeed $12. Then she bought 5 more tickets, which is 5*4 equals $20. Adding those together gives 12+20, which is $32. Yep, that seems correct.

I think I've got it. Haley spent a total of $32 on the tickets.
</think>

Haley bought 3 tickets and 5 extra tickets. Each ticket costs $4.

Calculating the total cost:

- Cost for the first 3 tickets: 3 × $4 = $12
- Cost for the extra 5 tickets: 5 × $4 = $20
- Total cost: $12 + $20 = $32

</think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many birds are in the pet store. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The pet store has 4 bird cages. Each cage has 8 parrots and 2 parakeets. I need to find the total number of birds in the store.

Hmm, let's break it down. First, I should probably figure out how many parrots and parakeets are in each cage and then multiply that by the number of cages. Once I have the total number of each type of bird, I can add them together to get the overall total.

So, starting with parrots. Each cage has 8 parrots. There are 4 cages. To find the total number of parrots, I can multiply the number of parrots per cage by the number of cages. That would be 8 times 4. Let me do that math: 8 * 4 equals 32. So, there are 32 parrots in total.

Next, let's tackle the parakeets. Each cage has 2 parakeets. Again, there are 4 cages. So, I need to multiply 2 by 4 to find the total number of parakeets. 2 * 4 is 8. So, there are 8 parakeets in total.

Now, to find the total number of birds, I need to add the number of parrots and parakeets together. That would be 32 parrots plus 8 parakeets. 32 + 8 equals 40. So, the pet store has a total of 40 birds.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Each cage has 8 parrots and 2 parakeets, and there are 4 cages. So, 8 times 4 is definitely 32 parrots, and 2 times 4 is 8 parakeets. Adding them together gives 40 birds in total. Yep, that seems correct.

The pet store has a total of 40 birds.

First, I need to determine the total number of chocolate pieces Kaleb has initially by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of pieces per box.

Next, Kaleb gives 5 chocolates to his brother. I'll subtract this number from the total to find out how many pieces he has left.

Finally, I'll present the result clearly.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Number of Chocolate Pieces:**
   
   Kaleb bought **14 boxes** of chocolate, and each box contains **6 pieces**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total pieces} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Pieces per box} = 14 \times 6 = 84
   \]

2. **Pieces Given to Brother:**
   
   Kaleb gave **5 pieces** to his little brother.
   
   \[
   \text{Pieces given} = 5
   \]

3. **Remaining Pieces:**
   
   Subtract the pieces given from the total pieces.
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = \text{Total pieces} - \text{Pieces given} = 84 - 5 = 79

                     Robin : uploaded 31 . pictures from her ; phone and ! 5 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics ; into 9 different albums ! with ! the same amount of pics in each : album, how many : pictures were ? in each of the ? albums? ; 
                 Okay, so I need to figure out how many pictures Robin has in each album. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, Robin uploaded 31 pictures from her phone and 5 from her camera to Facebook. So in total, she uploaded 31 + 5 = 36 pictures.

She then sorted these pictures into 9 different albums. Each album has the same number of pictures. So, if I let x be the number of pictures in each album, then the total number of pictures would be 9 times x, right? So, 9x = 36.

To find x, I can divide 36 by 9. 36 divided by 9 is 4. So, does that mean each album has 4 pictures?

Wait, let me double-check. If each album has 4 pictures and there are 9 albums, then 4 multiplied by 9 is indeed 36. That matches the total number of pictures Robin uploaded.

But hold on, she uploaded 31 from her phone and 5 from her camera. Does that affect the distribution of pictures in the albums? Hmm, maybe not necessarily. Because she just uploaded them all together and then sorted them into albums. So, each album could have a mix of phone and camera pictures, but the total per album is 4.

So, in each album, there are 4 pictures, regardless of where they came from. Therefore, the number of pictures in each album is 4.

I think that's the answer. Each album has 4 pictures.
</think>

Robin uploaded a total of 36 pictures to Facebook, sorting them into 9 albums with the same number of pictures in each. To find how many pictures are in each album, divide the total by the number of albums:

Total pictures = 31 (phone) + 5 (camera) = 36  
Number of albums = 9  
Pictures per album = 36 ÷ 9 = 4

                 {Let me try to figure this out.}

Okay, so Mike made $69 from mowing lawns over the summer. He spent $24 buying new mower blades. I need to find out how many 5-dollar games he could buy with the money he had left.

First, let me figure out how much money Mike has left after buying the mower blades. He made $69 and spent $24, so I can subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings to find his remaining money.

So, subtracting $24 from $69: 69 minus 24. Hmm, let me calculate that. 69 minus 20 is 49, and then subtract 4 more, which gives me 45. So, Mike has $45 left.

Now, he wants to buy 5-dollar games. I need to find out how many games he can buy with $45. Since each game costs $5, I can divide the total money he has left by the cost per game.

So, dividing 45 by 5: 45 divided by 5 is 9. That means Mike can buy 9 games with his remaining money.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. He earned $69, spent $24, so 69 minus 24 is indeed 45. And 45 divided by 5 is 9. Yeah, that seems correct.

I think that's all. So Mike can buy 9 five-dollar games.
</think>

Mike earned $69 from mowing lawns and spent $24 on new mower blades. To find out how much money he has left, subtract the amount he spent from his earnings:

\$69 - \$24 = \$45

Now, to determine how many 5-dollar games he can buy, divide the remaining money by the cost per game:

\$45 ÷ \$5 = 9

Therefore, Mike can buy \boxed{9} five-dollar games.

                <think>
First, I need to determine how many pictures Rachel took in total. She took 6 pictures at the zoo and 9 at the museum, so that's 6 + 9 = 15 pictures.

Next, she deleted 11 pictures. To find out how many pictures she has left, I subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures taken.

So, 15 total pictures minus 11 deleted pictures equals 4 remaining pictures.

Therefore, Rachel still has 4 pictures from her vacation.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of pictures Rachel took.**

- Pictures at the zoo: 6
- Pictures at the museum: 9

**Total pictures taken = 6 + 9 = 15**

                    question:
                     Maria was making baggies ! of cookies with 8 cookies ? in each bag. If ; she had 5 chocolate : chip , cookies and ; 19 oatmeal cookies, how many ? baggies could she ? make? , 
                 Okay, so Maria is making baggies of cookies. Let me try to figure this out step by step. First, I need to understand the problem properly.

She has two types of cookies: chocolate chip and oatmeal. The problem says she has 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies. Each bag contains 8 cookies. I need to find out how many baggies she can make in total.

Hmm, let me break it down. She has a total number of cookies, which is the sum of chocolate chip and oatmeal. So, that would be 5 + 19. Let me do that addition: 5 plus 19 is 24. So, she has 24 cookies in total.

Each bag can hold 8 cookies. To find out how many bags she can make, I need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per bag. That would be 24 divided by 8. Let me calculate that: 24 ÷ 8 equals 3. So, she can make 3 baggies.

Wait, but the problem mentions she has 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies. Is there a possibility that she can't mix the two types of cookies in a bag? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify whether each bag must have a certain number of each type or just any combination. It just says she's making baggies with 8 cookies each.

So, since there's no restriction mentioned on the types of cookies in each bag, I can assume she can mix them as needed. Therefore, the total number of cookies she has is 24, and each bag holds 8. So, 24 ÷ 8 is indeed 3 baggies.

Let me just double-check my math to be sure. 5 chocolate chip + 19 oatmeal equals 24 cookies. 24 divided by 8 is 3. Yep, that makes sense. So, Maria can make 3 baggies.
</think>

Maria has a total of 24 cookies (5 chocolate chip + 19 oatmeal). Since each bag can hold 8 cookies, she can make 24 ÷ 8 = 3 baggies.

                 {The final answer is}
</think>

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, April's discount flower shop is having a sale where each flower is \$3. Zoe buys 8 roses and 2 daisies. We need to figure out how much she spent.

First, let's identify the price per flower. The problem states that each flower is \$3. That seems straightforward.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for the roses and the daisies separately and then add them together.

Starting with the roses: Zoe bought 8 roses. Since each rose costs \$3, we can multiply the number of roses by the price per rose to find the total cost for the roses.

So, for the roses:
\[
8 \text{ roses} \times \$3 \text{ per rose} = \$24
\]

Now, let's move on to the daisies. Zoe bought 2 daisies. Again, each daisy costs \$3, so we'll multiply the number of daisies by the price per daisy.

For the daisies:
\[
2 \text{ daisies} \times \$3 \text{ per daisy} = \$6
\]

Now, to find the total amount Zoe spent, we'll add the cost of the roses and the daisies together.

Total cost:
\[
\$24 \text{ (roses)} + \$6 \text{ (daisies)} = \$30
\]

So, Zoe spent a total of \$30.

                 Okay, so Bianca is organizing her books. She has two types of books: mystery books and picture books. Each shelf must have exactly 8 books. She has 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books. I need to find out the total number of books she has.

Hmm, let me think. Each shelf holds 8 books. So for the mystery books, if there are 5 shelves, each with 8 books, the total number of mystery books would be 5 times 8. Similarly, for the picture books, since there are 4 shelves, each with 8 books, that would be 4 times 8.

Wait, but 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books. So each type is on separate shelves? Or is it that she has 5 shelves in total, some for mystery and some for picture? The problem says ""5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books."" So that suggests she has 5 shelves dedicated to mystery and 4 shelves dedicated to picture. So all the mystery books are on those 5 shelves, and all the picture books are on those 4 shelves.

So the total number of mystery books would be 5 shelves multiplied by 8 books per shelf, which is 5 * 8. Let me calculate that: 5 times 8 is 40. So there are 40 mystery books.

Similarly, the picture books are on 4 shelves, each with 8 books, so that's 4 * 8. 4 times 8 is 32. So there are 32 picture books.

Now, to find the total number of books, I need to add the mystery and picture books together. So 40 plus 32 equals 72. Therefore, Bianca has a total of 72 books.

Wait, let me double-check. 5 shelves times 8 is 40. 4 shelves times 8 is 32. 40 plus 32 is 72. Yeah, that seems right.
</think>

To determine the total number of books Bianca has, we first calculate the number of each type of book separately and then sum them.

1. **Mystery Books:**
   - Bianca has 5 shelves of mystery books.
   - Each shelf holds exactly 8 books.
   - Total mystery books = 5 shelves × 8 books/shelf = 40 books.

2. **Picture Books:**
   - Bianca has 4 shelves of picture books.
   - Each shelf holds exactly 8 books.
   - Total picture books = 4 shelves × 8 books/shelf = 32 books.

</think>
Alright, let's try to figure out how many pages John would use to put his baseball cards into the binder. Okay, so he has 3 question marks on each page. Hmm, maybe that means each page can hold 3 cards? Or maybe it's the number of cards per page? Wait, the question says he's organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 3 ? on each page. So, I think each page can hold 3 cards. So, each page has space for 3 cards.

Now, he has 8 new cards and 16 old cards. So, total cards he wants to put in the binder would be 8 plus 16. Let me add that up: 8 + 16 equals 24. So, he has 24 cards in total.

If each page can hold 3 cards, then the number of pages he needs would be the total number of cards divided by the number of cards per page. So, that's 24 divided by 3. Let me do that division: 24 ÷ 3 equals 8. So, he would need 8 pages.

Wait, but let me double-check. If each page has 3 cards, then 8 pages would hold 8 times 3, which is 24 cards. Yes, that matches the total number of cards he has. So, that seems right.

I think that's it. He needs 8 pages to put all his 24 cards into the binder.
</think>

To determine how many pages John needs, first calculate the total number of cards and then divide by the number of cards each page can hold.

1. **Total number of cards**: 8 new + 16 old = 24 cards.
2. **Cards per page**: 3.
3. **Number of pages needed**: 24 ÷ 3 = 8.

                 Correct the syntax and punctuation, then solve the problem.
</think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here about Isabel baking brownies. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem says she baked 3 brownies but needed 5 total for her party. Hmm, so she was short by 2 brownies, right? She needed 5 but only baked 3.

Now, it mentions she used 5 cups of flour on ""each one."" Wait, that part is a bit confusing. Does that mean she used 5 cups per brownie? Or does it mean she used 5 cups in total for all three? Let me read it again: ""she used 5 cups of flour on ! each ; one, : how ; much cups of flour ? does she still ! need?""

Oh, I see, the punctuation is a bit messed up, but I think the intended meaning is that she used 5 cups of flour per brownie. So each brownie required 5 cups of flour. If she baked 3 brownies, how much flour did she use in total? Let me calculate that.

If each brownie needs 5 cups, then for 3 brownies, it would be 3 multiplied by 5. So 3 times 5 is 15. Therefore, she used 15 cups of flour in total. But she only baked 3 brownies, and she needed 5 for the party. That means she needs 2 more brownies. Since each brownie requires 5 cups, she needs 2 times 5, which is 10 more cups of flour.

Wait, let me double-check that. She needs 5 brownies in total. She baked 3, so she needs 2 more. Each brownie uses 5 cups, so 2 brownies would require 2 times 5, which is 10 cups. So she needs an additional 10 cups of flour. 

I think that's it. She used 15 cups already, but she needs 10 more to make the remaining 2 brownies. So the total flour she needs is 15 plus 10, which is 25 cups. But the question specifically asks how much she still needs, so it's just the additional 10 cups.
</think>

Isabel baked 3 brownies but needed 5 for her party, so she needs 2 more. Each brownie requires 5 cups of flour. Therefore, she needs 2 × 5 = 10 more cups of flour.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     In : fourth grade ? there were 31 students at , the start of the , year. ; During the . year ! 5 students ; left and 11 new students came to : school. How ? many students were : in fourth grade at the end? 
                 Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is about fourth graders in a school. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

At the start of the year, there were 31 students in fourth grade. Then, during the year, 5 students left, and 11 new students came to the school. The question is asking how many students were in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Hmm, okay. So, initially, 31 students are in fourth grade. Then, during the school year, some things happen: 5 leave, and 11 come. But wait, are the 11 new students all in fourth grade? Or are they in other grades? The problem isn't entirely clear. Hmm, that might affect the answer.

Wait, the problem says ""11 new students came to school."" It doesn't specify which grade. So, I think it's safe to assume that the 11 new students are entering fourth grade. Because if they were entering other grades, like first or second, that might complicate things, but since the question is about fourth grade, we can probably assume they're joining fourth grade.

So, if 5 students left fourth grade, and 11 joined, then the total number of fourth graders at the end would be 31 minus 5 plus 11. Let me calculate that: 31 - 5 is 26, plus 11 is 37. So, 37 students.

But wait, hold on. Is there a chance that the 11 new students are not all in fourth grade? Maybe some are in other grades, like kindergarten or fifth grade. But since the question is specifically about fourth grade, I think we can assume the 11 are joining fourth grade. Otherwise, the problem doesn't give enough information to figure out how many students are in other grades, which would be necessary to calculate the change in fourth grade.

So, to recap: At the start, 31 in fourth grade. 5 leave, so subtract 5. 11 new come, add 11. 31 - 5 is 26, plus 11 is 37. Therefore, 37 students are in fourth grade at the end.

Wait another thought: Is there a possibility that the 11 new students are all in fourth grade? Or could some be in other grades? If the school has other grades, like first, second, third, fourth, fifth, etc., then 11 new students could be spread across those grades. But since the problem doesn't specify, we can't know how many are in fourth grade versus others. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the change in fourth grade.

So, 5 leave fourth grade, 11 join. So, 31 -5 +11 =37.

I think that's the answer. So, 37 students in fourth grade at the end.

But to be thorough, let's consider if the 11 new students are only in fourth grade. Then, yes, 31-5+11=37. If they're in other grades, then the number of fourth graders would stay at 31, because only 5 left. But since the problem is about fourth graders, I think we're supposed to assume the 11 are joining fourth grade.

Therefore, the final answer is 37.
</think>

To determine the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we start with the initial count and adjust for the changes.

1. **Initial number of fourth graders**: 31
2. **Students who left**: 5
3. **New students who joined**: 11

**Calculation**:
31 (initial) - 5 (left) + 11 (new) = 37

**Answer**: 37 students were in fourth grade at the end of the year.

**Given:**
- Adam answered **8 questions** correct in the first half.
- Adam answered **2 questions** correct in the second half.
- Each question is worth **8 points**.

**Steps to Calculate the Final Score:**

1. **Calculate Points from First Half:**
   - Number of correct answers in the first half: 8
   - Points per question: 8
   - Total points from the first half = 8 (correct answers) × 8 (points per question) = 64 points

                 {The final answer is}
</think>
First, I need to determine the number of cans Paul collected on each day.

On Saturday, he filled 6 bags, and each bag contains 8 cans. So, the total number of cans collected on Saturday is 6 multiplied by 8, which equals 48 cans.

On Sunday, he filled 3 more bags. Again, each bag has 8 cans. Therefore, the total number of cans collected on Sunday is 3 multiplied by 8, resulting in 24 cans.

To find the total number of cans collected over the weekend, I will add the cans from Saturday and Sunday together. So, 48 cans from Saturday plus 24 cans from Sunday equals 72 cans in total.

Thus, Paul collected a total of 72 cans.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cans collected on Saturday:**
   - Paul filled **6 bags** on Saturday.
   - Each bag contains **8 cans**.
   - **Total cans on Saturday** = Number of bags × Cans per bag
   - **Total cans on Saturday** = 6 × 8 = 48 cans

2. **Cans collected on Sunday:**
   - Paul filled **3 more bags** on Sunday.
   - Each bag contains **8 cans**.
   - **Total cans on Sunday** = Number of bags × Cans per bag
   - **Total cans on Sunday** = 3 × 8 = 24 cans

3. **Total cans collected:**
   - **Total cans** = Cans collected on Saturday + Cans collected on Sunday
   - **Total cans** = 48 + 24 = 72 cans

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Bianca and her ? friends were recycling paper ; for . their ! class. ? For : every 3 : pounds they ? recycled they earned one point. If Bianca recycled 24 pounds and ; her friends , recycled 3 pounds, how many : points did they earn? 
                 Okay, so Bianca and her friends are recycling paper for their class. The problem is asking how many points they earned. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, I need to figure out the rate at which they earn points. The problem says, ""for every 3 pounds they recycled, they earned one point."" So, that means for every 3 pounds, 1 point. That seems straightforward. So, the ratio is 3 pounds to 1 point. 

Alright, now, Bianca recycled 24 pounds. So, how many points does she earn from that? Since it's 3 pounds per point, I can divide the total pounds she recycled by 3. So, 24 divided by 3 is 8. So, Bianca earned 8 points from her recycling.

Now, her friends recycled 3 pounds. Using the same rate, how many points did they earn? Again, it's 3 pounds per point, so 3 divided by 3 is 1. So, her friends earned 1 point.

Wait, let me double-check that. If 3 pounds give 1 point, then 3 pounds would be 1 point. That makes sense. So, Bianca gets 8, friends get 1. So, total points earned together would be 8 plus 1, which is 9 points.

Hold on, did I miss anything? Let me go back through the problem. The problem says Bianca and her friends were recycling paper for their class. Every 3 pounds recycled, they earned one point. Bianca recycled 24 pounds, her friends recycled 3 pounds. So, yeah, I think I got that right. 

Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by finding the total pounds they recycled and then dividing by 3? So, total pounds is 24 plus 3, which is 27 pounds. Then, 27 divided by 3 is 9 points. Oh, that's another way to do it. So, same answer, 9 points. So, that confirms it.

Hmm, okay, so both methods give me the same result, which is good. So, Bianca and her friends together earned 9 points.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me redo the division. 24 divided by 3 is 8, because 3 times 8 is 24. 3 divided by 3 is 1, because 3 times 1 is 3. Adding them together, 8 plus 1 is 9. Yep, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I add the pounds first: 24 plus 3 is 27, then 27 divided by 3 is 9. Either way, same answer. So, I think I've got it right.

Is there any chance the problem is trying to trick me? Maybe by having some hidden condition? The problem doesn't mention any other factors, like different rates for different people or something. It just says for every 3 pounds, one point. So, it seems straightforward. It's just a simple ratio problem.

Wait, maybe I should consider the units. They recycled pounds, and points are earned per 3 pounds. So, the pounds unit is in the numerator, and points are in the denominator. So, pounds divided by 3 gives points. Yeah, that makes sense.

Let me think if I can represent this as a proportion. If 3 pounds = 1 point, then 24 pounds = x points. So, 3/1 = 24/x. Wait, that's cross-multiplying. So, 3x = 24, so x = 8. Similarly, 3 pounds = 1 point, so 3/y = 3/1, so y =1. So, that also gives Bianca 8 points and friends 1 point, total 9 points. So, same result.

Okay, so all the methods lead me to 9 points. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in my reasoning. So, the final answer is 9 points.
</think>

They earned a total of 9 points. {The final answer is} Bianca and her friends earned a total of 9 points. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Points System:**
   - Every 3 pounds recycled gives 1 point.
   
2. **Calculate Bianca's Points:**
   - Bianca recycled 24 pounds.
   - Points earned = Total pounds recycled ÷ 3 = 24 ÷ 3 = 8 points.

3. **Calculate Her Friends' Points:**
   - Her friends recycled 3 pounds.

   - The chef had already cooked 8 chicken wings.
   - The chef then cooked an additional 10 chicken wings specifically for this group.
   - We need to determine how many chicken wings each friend will get if they each receive the same amount.

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Chicken Wings:**
   - Already cooked: 8 chicken wings
   - Additional cooked for the group: 10 chicken wings
   - **Total wings available = 8 + 10 = 18 chicken wings**

3. **Divide the Total Wings Among the 3 Friends:**
   - Each friend should get the same number of wings.
   - **Number of wings per friend = Total wings ÷ Number of friends**
   - **Number of wings per person = 18 ÷ 3 = 6 chicken wings**

                    question:

                 Okay, so I need to figure out how many socks John has after he threw away some and bought new ones. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says John had 33 socks. So initially, he has 33 socks.

Then it mentions he threw away 19 old ones that didn't fit. So he's getting rid of 19 socks. I need to subtract those from his total.

After throwing away the old socks, he bought 13 new ones. So he adds 13 socks to his collection.

So the process is: Start with 33, subtract 19, then add 13.

Let me calculate that: 33 minus 19 is... hmm, 33 minus 10 is 23, and then minus 9 more is 14. So 33 - 19 = 14.

Then add the 13 new socks: 14 + 13 equals 27.

Wait, so does that mean he has 27 socks left? That seems right. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with 33, subtract 19: 33 - 19. Let me do this on paper to be sure.

33  
-19  
____

Starting from the right, 3 minus 9. Can't do that, so I need to borrow. 13 - 9 is 4. Then the next digit is 2 (since I borrowed 1 from the 3, making it 2) minus 1 is 1. So the result is 14. That checks out.

Then adding 13: 14 + 13. 14 + 10 is 24, plus 3 is 27. Yep, that's correct.

So after throwing away 19 and buying 13, John has 27 socks left.

I think that's all. No other information is given, so I don't need to consider anything else. So the final answer is 27 socks.
</think>

John initially has 33 socks. He throws away 19 and buys 13 new ones. The calculation is as follows:

                 Okay, so I need to figure out how many groups the coach should put the players into. Let me start by understanding the problem properly.

First, the school's baseball team has 2 new players and 6 returning players. So, in total, how many players are there? Well, 2 plus 6 equals 8 players. Got that.

Now, the coach is putting them into groups, and each group has 4 players. I need to find out how many such groups there would be. Hmm, so if each group has 4 players, then the number of groups should be the total number of players divided by the number of players per group, right? That makes sense because if you have 8 players and you put 4 in each group, you'd have 2 groups. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here.

Is there any other information in the problem that might affect this calculation? Let me reread the problem. It says there are 2 new players and 6 returning players, so 8 in total. The coach puts them into groups with 4 players in each group. So, yeah, it's just a division problem. 8 divided by 4 equals 2 groups. That seems straightforward.

But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any trick or detail I might be overlooking. The problem mentions the coach putting them into groups, but doesn't specify if the groups are of equal size or if there are any restrictions. It just says each group has 4 players. So, assuming that the groups are all the same size, which is 4, then dividing the total number by 4 should give the number of groups.

Wait, another thought: is there a possibility that some players might not be grouped together? For example, if the coach has some reason to separate them, but the problem doesn't mention that. It just says the coach put them into groups with 4 players each. So, I think it's safe to assume that all players are being grouped, and each group has exactly 4, so it's a straightforward division.

Let me also think about the phrasing. The problem uses a semicolon and exclamation mark, but I don't think that affects the meaning. It's probably just punctuation. So, the key pieces of information are the number of players and the size of each group.

So, to recap: total players = 2 new + 6 returning = 8. Each group has 4 players. Number of groups = total players / players per group = 8 / 4 = 2. That seems correct.

Is there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using multiplication instead, but that would be if we were trying to find the number of players per group, which we already know. So, no, division is the correct approach here.

I think I've considered all angles. The answer should be 2 groups.
</think>

The school's baseball team has a total of 8 players (2 new + 6 returning). The coach divides them into groups of 4 players each. To find the number of groups, divide the total number of players by the number of players per group: 8 ÷ 4 = 2 groups.

                    question:
                     ; A painter needed to paint : 6 rooms in a building. Each room , takes . 5 hours to paint. If he , already painted , 2 rooms, how much longer ? will he take to paint ? the . rest? ; 
                

</think>
Alright, so I've got this problem here about a painter who needs to paint 6 rooms. Each room takes 5 hours to paint. The question is, if the painter has already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will it take him to paint the rest? Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I want to understand the total amount of work involved. Since each room takes 5 hours, painting one room is equivalent to 5 hours of work. So, if there are 6 rooms, the total work required would be 6 rooms multiplied by 5 hours per room. Let me write that down:

Total work = Number of rooms × Time per room
Total work = 6 × 5 = 30 hours

Okay, so the painter has to invest a total of 30 hours of work to paint all 6 rooms.

Now, the painter has already painted 2 rooms. So, how much work has he already done? Well, since each room is 5 hours, painting 2 rooms would take:

Work done = Number of painted rooms × Time per room
Work done = 2 × 5 = 10 hours

So, he's already put in 10 hours of work.

Now, the question is asking how much longer he will take to paint the rest. So, I need to find out how much work is left and then determine how much time that will take.

Work remaining = Total work - Work done
Work remaining = 30 - 10 = 20 hours

So, there's 20 hours of work left.

Since each room takes 5 hours, the number of rooms left to paint would be:

Number of rooms left = Work remaining ÷ Time per room
Number of rooms left = 20 ÷ 5 = 4 rooms

Therefore, there are 4 rooms left to paint.

Now, to find out how much longer the painter will take, I need to calculate the time required for the remaining 4 rooms. Since each room takes 5 hours:

Time remaining = Number of rooms left × Time per room
Time remaining = 4 × 5 = 20 hours

Wait, that doesn't seem right. If he has already worked 10 hours and needs to work 20 more hours, that would mean the total time taken is 30 hours, which is correct. But the question specifically asks how much longer he will take to paint the rest, so it's the remaining time.

So, the time remaining is 20 hours. But the question might be expecting the answer in terms of days or weeks, but since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's fine to leave it in hours.

Alternatively, if I want to express the time in days, since 20 hours is less than a day (24 hours), it would be a little less than a day and a half. But again, the problem doesn't specify units beyond hours, so perhaps it's better to stick with hours.

Wait, actually, the question says ""how much longer will he take to paint the rest?"" So, it's asking for the remaining time in hours, I think.

So, to recap:

Total rooms: 6
Time per room: 5 hours
Already painted: 2 rooms
Work done: 2 × 5 = 10 hours
Total work: 6 × 5 = 30 hours
Work remaining: 30 - 10 = 20 hours
Number of rooms remaining: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 rooms
Time remaining: 4 × 5 = 20 hours

So, the painter needs to spend an additional 20 hours to finish painting the remaining 4 rooms.

I think that's all. I don't see any complications here. It's a straightforward calculation based on the total work required and the work already done.
</think>

The painter needs to spend an additional 20 hours to finish painting the remaining 4 rooms.

                    question:
                     A waiter had 22 customers in his section. : If . 14 of ; them left and the rest . of ? his tables had ! 4 ; people ; at each table, how many : tables did he have? 
                 ………………………………………………………………………………………
Okay, so I need to figure out how many tables the waiter had based on the information given. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says the waiter had 22 customers in his section. That probably means there were 22 people total, right? So, the total number of customers is 22.

Then, it mentions that 14 of them left. Hmm, so 14 customers left, which means the number of customers who stayed would be 22 minus 14. Let me calculate that: 22 - 14 = 8. So, 8 customers stayed.

Next, it says the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table. Wait, so the remaining customers, which are 8, are distributed among the tables such that each table has 4 people. Hmm, that makes me think that the number of tables is equal to the number of remaining customers divided by the number of people per table.

So, if I have 8 customers and each table has 4 people, how many tables are there? That would be 8 divided by 4, which is 2. So, does that mean he had 2 tables?

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. The total customers are 22. 14 left, so 8 stayed. If each table has 4 people, then 8 divided by 4 is indeed 2 tables. So, yeah, that seems right.

But let me think about it another way to confirm. If he had T tables, each with 4 people, then the total number of customers would be 4T. But since 14 left, the number of customers is 22, so 22 - 14 = 8. So, 4T = 8, so T = 2. Yep, same answer.

So, I think the answer is 2 tables. Let me just visualize it. If there were 2 tables, each with 4 people, that's 8 people. 22 total, 14 left, 8 stayed. That adds up. If it were more tables, like 3, then 4 times 3 is 12, but we have 8, which is less than 12, so 3 tables wouldn't work because 8 is less than 12. So, only 2 tables fit.

Therefore, I'm confident that the number of tables is 2.
</think>

The waiter initially had 22 customers. After 14 left, 8 remained. Since each table has 4 people, the number of tables is 8 divided by 4, which equals 2.

{The final answer is 2 tables.}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",2,2.0,2.0

                    question:
                     , Roger had 120 pieces . of clothing to ; wash. ! He put 48 of them ! in : one load, but : decided to split . the rest ! into 9 equal , loads. How many pieces of , clothing could go ! in each of the small loads? 
                 , 

First, I need to determine the total number of clothing pieces Roger has. He initially has 120 pieces. He uses 48 of them in the first load, so the remaining pieces are 120 minus 48, which equals 72 pieces.

Next, he decides to split the remaining 72 pieces into 9 equal loads. To find out how many pieces go into each small load, I need to divide the total remaining pieces by the number of loads. So, 72 divided by 9 equals 8.

Therefore, each of the small loads can contain 8 pieces of clothing.
</think>

**Solution:**

Roger has a total of **120** pieces of clothing to wash.

1. **First Load:**
   - He uses **48** pieces for the first load.
   - Remaining pieces = Total pieces - Pieces used in the first load
   - Remaining pieces = 120 - 48 = **72**

2. **Splitting Remaining Pieces:**
   - He decides to split the remaining **72** pieces into **9** equal loads.
   - To find out how many pieces go into each load:
     - Pieces per load = Remaining pieces ÷ Number of loads
     - Pieces per load = 72 ÷ 9 = **8**

**Final Answer:**
Each small load can contain \boxed{8} pieces of clothing.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",8,8.0,8.0

                 {
</think>
Alright, so I have this problem here about fourth-grade students. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, at the start of the year, there were 10 students in fourth grade. During the year, 4 students left, and 42 new students came. I need to find out how many students were in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Hmm, let me think. At the beginning, there were 10 students. Then, some left, and some new ones came. So, the total number of students at the end should be the original number minus those who left plus the new ones who arrived, right?

Let me write that down. So, original students = 10. Number who left = 4. Number who came = 42. So, the total at the end would be 10 - 4 + 42. Let me calculate that.

10 minus 4 is 6. Then, 6 plus 42 is 48. So, does that mean there are 48 students in fourth grade at the end of the year?

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 10, subtracting 4 gives me 6, and adding 42 gives me 48. Yeah, that seems right. So, the final number is 48.

I guess another way to think about it is that the number of new students who came is more than those who left, so the total should increase. Since 42 came in and only 4 left, the increase is 42 - 4, which is 38. Then adding that to the original 10 gives 48. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation.

I don't think I missed anything here. The problem seems straightforward: just adjusting the total based on who left and who came. So, I'm pretty confident the answer is 48.
</think>

To determine the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we start with the initial count of 10 students. During the year, 4 students left, and 42 new students arrived. 

- **Initial number of students:** 10
- **Students who left:** 4
- **New students who arrived:** 42

The total number of students at the end of the year is calculated as follows:
\[ 10 - 4 + 42 = 48 \]

Thus, there were 48 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

                <think>
First, I need to determine the total number of books that Roger has to organize.

There are 14 books in total.

Next, the librarian takes 2 books from this total, leaving Roger with the remaining books.

So, the number of books left with Roger is 14 minus 2, which equals 12 books.

Finally, since Roger can fit 3 books on each shelf, I'll divide the total number of books he has by the number of books he can place on a shelf to find out how many shelves he needs.

12 books divided by 3 books per shelf equals 4 shelves.

Therefore, Roger will need 4 shelves.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Total Number of Books:**
   - There are **14** books in total.

2. **Books Taken by the Librarian:**
   - The librarian takes **2** books.
   - Books left with Roger = Total books - Books taken by the librarian
   - Books left = 14 - 2 = **12** books.

3. **Books per Shelf:**
   - Roger can fit **3** books on each shelf.

4. **Number of Shelves Needed:**
   - To find the number of shelves, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold.
   - Number of shelves = Books left / Books per shelf
   - Number of shelves = 12 / 3 = **4** shelves.

                 Corrected grammar: Bianca picked 39 tulips [and] 49 roses [to] make flower bouquets. If she only used 81 [of] the flowers [though], how many extra flowers did Bianca pick?

Okay, so Bianca picked 39 tulips and 49 roses to make flower bouquets. But she only used 81 of the flowers. I need to figure out how many extra flowers she picked. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I should figure out how many flowers she used in total. She used 81 flowers. But these flowers are a combination of tulips and roses. So, I need to know how many tulips and roses she used. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify how the 81 flowers are divided between tulips and roses. Hmm, maybe I need to assume something here.

Wait, actually, the original problem says she picked 39 tulips and 49 roses. So, the total number of flowers she picked is 39 + 49, which is 88 flowers. But she only used 81 of them. So, the extra flowers she picked would be the total she picked minus the total she used. So, 88 - 81 = 7. So, she picked 7 extra flowers.

Wait, but hold on. Maybe I'm oversimplifying. The problem says she picked 39 tulips and 49 roses, and she used 81 of the flowers. So, she used 81 flowers in total, but she used some tulips and some roses. So, the extra flowers would be the difference between the total picked and the total used.

But without knowing how many of each flower she used, I can't directly subtract. Wait, but maybe the problem is just asking for the total extra flowers, regardless of which type. So, if she used 81 flowers, and she had 88 in total, the extra is 88 - 81 = 7. So, she picked 7 extra flowers.

Alternatively, maybe the question is implying that she used 81 flowers in total, but each bouquet requires a certain number of tulips and roses. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify how many flowers per bouquet. So, maybe it's just a straightforward calculation.

Let me read the problem again: Bianca picked 39 tulips and 49 roses to make flower bouquets. If she only used 81 of the flowers, how many extra flowers did she pick? So, she picked 88 flowers in total, used 81, so she has 7 extra. So, the answer is 7.

But wait, is there another way to interpret it? Maybe she used 81 flowers, meaning she used 81 flowers in total, but not necessarily all the tulips and roses. So, she could have used some tulips and some roses, but not all. So, the extra flowers would be the total picked minus the total used.

Yes, that makes sense. So, 39 + 49 = 88 total flowers picked. She used 81, so 88 - 81 = 7 extra flowers picked. So, the answer is 7.

I think that's the correct approach. So, the extra flowers Bianca picked are 7.
</think>

Bianca picked a total of 39 tulips and 49 roses, which sums up to 88 flowers. She used 81 flowers, so the extra flowers she picked are 88 minus 81, which equals 7.

{The final answer is} Bianca picked 7 extra flowers.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",7,7.0,7.0

First, I need to determine the total time Emily spent on each piece of furniture.

Emily bought 4 new chairs and 2 new tables. That makes a total of 6 pieces of furniture.

She spent 8 minutes on each piece, so I multiply the number of pieces by the time per piece: 6 pieces * 8 minutes per piece = 48 minutes.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of furniture pieces:**
   - Chairs: 4
   - Tables: 2
   - **Total pieces = Chairs + Tables = 4 + 2 = 6**

2. **Calculate the total time spent:**

                     , A ? pet store has 6 bird cages. . If each cage has 2 ! parrots ! and 7 parakeets in ! it, how many birds does the : pet store have ? total? 
                 Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is about a pet store with bird cages. Hmm, the question is asking how many birds the store has in total. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

Alright, the problem says: ""A pet store has 6 bird cages. If each cage has 2 parrots and 7 parakeets, how many birds does the pet store have in total?"" Wait, the way it's phrased, I need to clarify whether each cage has 2 parrots and 7 parakeets, or if it's 2 parrots and 7 parakeets in each cage. Probably the latter, that each cage has 2 parrots and 7 parakeets.

So, the store has 6 cages. Each cage has 2 parrots and 7 parakeets. So, to find the total number of birds, I should calculate the total number of parrots and the total number of parakeets and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of parrots. There are 6 cages, each with 2 parrots. So, 6 multiplied by 2. That's 12 parrots.

Next, the number of parakeets. Each cage has 7 parakeets, and there are 6 cages. So, 6 multiplied by 7. Hmm, 6 times 7 is 42.

Now, adding both totals together: 12 parrots plus 42 parakeets equals 54 birds in total.

Wait a second, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 6 cages times 2 parrots each: 6*2=12. That's correct. 6 cages times 7 parakeets each: 6*7=42. That's right too. 12 plus 42 is 54. Yep, that adds up.

So, the total number of birds the pet store has is 54.

                    question:
                     , Dave ; had to , wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve ? shirts before ! school. If he . had only washed 20 of ! them ? by the time school started, how many did he ; not wash? ; 
                 Okay, so I have this problem here: Dave had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 20 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It says Dave had to wash a total of 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts. So, altogether, that's 9 plus 27 shirts. Let me add that up. 9 plus 27 is 36 shirts in total. Okay, so he had to wash 36 shirts before school started.

Now, it says if he had only washed 20 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash. So, he didn't finish washing all 36 shirts. He only washed 20, which means there are some shirts left unwashed. So, to find out how many he didn't wash, I think I need to subtract the number he washed from the total number of shirts.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem mentions short sleeve and long sleeve shirts separately. So, he had 9 short sleeve and 27 long sleeve. But when he washes, does he wash them all together, or are they separate tasks? Hmm, maybe I should consider if he washed all the short sleeves or all the long sleeves or a mix.

But the problem doesn't specify how many of each type he washed. It just says he washed 20 in total. So, he could have washed some combination of short and long sleeve shirts, totaling 20. But without knowing how many of each he washed, I might not be able to find the exact number of each type he didn't wash. Wait, but the question is asking how many he didn't wash in total, not by type. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me go back. The total shirts to wash are 9 short + 27 long = 36 shirts. He washed 20 of them. So, the number he didn't wash is 36 minus 20, which is 16. So, he didn't wash 16 shirts.

Wait, but maybe I should check if the problem is implying that he didn't wash all of a particular type. For example, maybe he didn't finish washing all the short or long sleeve shirts, but I don't see any indication of that. The problem doesn't specify that he had to wash all short sleeves or all long sleeves; it just says he had to wash 9 short and 27 long. So, he might have washed some of each, and 20 in total.

But the question is about how many he didn't wash, not how many of each type. So, the total number he didn't wash would be 36 - 20 = 16. So, I think the answer is 16.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think again. If he had to wash 9 short and 27 long, and he only washed 20, then yes, 36 total minus 20 washed equals 16 not washed. So, that seems straightforward.

I guess I was overcomplicating it at first by thinking about the types, but since the question is about the total number, it's just a simple subtraction problem.
</think>

To determine how many shirts Dave did not wash, we start by calculating the total number of shirts he needed to wash. There are 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts, so the total is:

9 + 27 = 36 shirts.

Dave washed 20 shirts before school started. To find out how many he did not wash, we subtract the number he washed from the total:

36 - 20 = 16 shirts.

Therefore, Dave did not wash 16 shirts.

                 Okay, so Haley took a total of 50 pictures. She took some at the zoo and some at the museum. The problem says she took 50 pictures at the zoo and 8 at the museum. Wait, no, actually, let me read that again. It says ""at the zoo and 8 at the museum."" Hmm, maybe it's 50 at the zoo and 8 at the museum? Or is it 50 in total? Wait, no, the wording is: ""Haley took 50 pictures: at the zoo and 8 at the museum."" Oh, maybe the 50 is the total. So she took 50 pictures in total, with some at the zoo and 8 at the museum. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If she took 50 in total, then she can't have taken 8 at the museum. Hmm, maybe I misread.

Wait, no, looking again: ""Haley took 50 pictures: at the zoo and 8 at the museum."" So it seems like she took 50 pictures in total, some at the zoo and 8 at the museum. So that would mean she took 50 total, which includes the 8 at the museum. So the rest, 50 minus 8, which is 42, were taken at the zoo.

But then she later deleted 38 of the pictures. So how many does she have left? Wait, she has two sets: some at the zoo and some at the museum. She took 42 at the zoo and 8 at the museum. Then she deleted 38 pictures. But are the deletions from one category or the total? The problem says she deleted 38 of the pictures. So that's 38 total pictures she deleted. So she started with 50, deleted 38, so she has 12 left.

Wait, but maybe she deleted 38 from each location? The problem isn't clear on that. Let me check the problem again. It says, ""If she later deleted 38 of the pictures."" So it's 38 in total, not 38 from each place. So she started with 50, deleted 38, so 12 remain.

Alternatively, maybe she had 50 in total, with 42 at the zoo and 8 at the museum. She then deleted 38, but maybe she deleted 38 from the zoo and 8 from the museum. But the problem doesn't specify that, so I think it's safer to assume that she deleted 38 in total, leaving 12.

Wait, but the problem says ""deleted 38 of the pictures."" It doesn't specify from where, so it's ambiguous. Hmm. But in the initial statement, she took 50 pictures: at the zoo and 8 at the museum. So that would mean 50 total, with 42 at the zoo and 8 at the museum.

If she later deleted 38, without specifying, it's safer to assume she deleted 38 in total, leaving 50 - 38 = 12.

Alternatively, maybe she had 50 at the zoo and 8 at the museum, totaling 58, but that doesn't make sense because the initial statement says she took 50 pictures, so probably 50 in total.

Wait, no, the initial statement is: ""Haley took 50 pictures: at the zoo and 8 at the museum."" So that implies 50 in total, with some at the zoo and 8 at the museum. So the breakdown is 42 at the zoo and 8 at the museum. Then she deletes 38, so 42 - x at the zoo and 8 - y at the museum, where x + y = 38. But without knowing how many she deleted from each location, we can't determine the exact number left. So perhaps the problem expects us to assume she deleted 38 in total, so 50 - 38 = 12.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem says she took 50 pictures: at the zoo and 8 at the museum. So that would be 50 total, meaning 50 - 8 = 42 at the zoo. Then she deletes 38 pictures. So she could have deleted all from the museum, which had only 8, but 38 is more than 8, so she must have deleted some from both. So she can't delete 38 from the museum alone because there are only 8 there. So she must have deleted 8 from the museum and 30 from the zoo, because 8 + 30 = 38. So then she would have 42 - 30 = 12 at the zoo and 0 at the museum. So total 12 left.

But wait, is that the correct interpretation? The problem doesn't specify where she deleted the pictures from,",20,20.0,12.0

                    question:
                    ?  For a ! birthday party Cody ; bought 4 ? regular sodas and 44 , diet sodas. If ; his fridge would only hold 6 on ? each shelf, how many ! shelves would he fill , up? 
                <think>
First, I need to determine the total number of sodas Cody bought. He purchased 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas, which sums up to 48 sodas in total.

Next, I should consider the capacity of the fridge. Each shelf can hold 6 sodas. To find out how many shelves are needed to accommodate all 48 sodas, I divide the total number of sodas by the capacity of each shelf.

Finally, I calculate the number of shelves required by performing the division: 48 ÷ 6, which equals 8. Therefore, Cody will need 8 shelves to fill his fridge.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Regular sodas bought:** 4
- **Diet sodas bought:** 44
- **Total sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas = 4 + 44 = 48**
- **Each shelf can hold:** 6 sodas

**Step 1:** Calculate the total number of sodas.
\[
\text{Total sodas} = 4 \, (\text{regular}) + 44 \, (\text{diet}) = 48 \, \text{sodas}
\]

**Step 2:** Determine the number of shelves required.
\[
\text{Number of shelves} = \frac{\text{Total sodas}}{\text{Sodas per shelf}} = \frac{48}{6} = 8
\]

**Final Answer:**
Cody will need to fill \boxed{8} shelves. {The final answer is}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",8,8.0,8.0

**Given:**
- The cafeteria ordered **6 red apples** and **15 green apples** for student lunches.

**Problem:**
- If **only 5 students** wanted fruit, how many **extra apples** did the cafeteria end up with?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Total Apples Ordered:**
   - Red apples: 6
   - Green apples: 15
   - **Total apples = 6 + 15 = 21 apples**

2. **Apples Needed by Students:**
   - Only **5 students** wanted fruit.

                    question:
                     A book ; store had . 4 books in ; the : bargin bin. If they sold 3 books, but then put : 10 more ! in the bin, how many . books would , be in the bin? . 
                 Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what it's asking.

Alright, the problem is: ""A book store had 4 books in the bargain bin. If they sold 3 books, but then put 10 more in the bin, how many books would be in the bin?"" Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, the store starts with 4 books in the bin. So, initially, bin has 4 books.

Then, they sold 3 books. So, they sold 3, which means they took 3 out of the bin. So after selling, how many books are left? Well, 4 minus 3 is 1. So now, the bin has 1 book left.

But wait, after selling those 3, they put 10 more books into the bin. So, adding 10 more to the remaining 1. So, 1 plus 10 is 11. So, does that mean the bin now has 11 books?

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The problem says: ""they sold 3 books, but then put 10 more in the bin."" So, sold 3, then added 10. So, yes, after selling, 1 left, then adding 10, total becomes 11.

But let me think again. Maybe I'm misreading the problem. It says, ""A book store had 4 books in the bargain bin. If they sold 3 books, but then put 10 more in the bin, how many books would be in the bin?""

So, starting with 4, selling 3, so 1 left. Then adding 10, so total is 11. That seems straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me into thinking that the 10 are added before selling? But the wording says: ""they sold 3 books, but then put 10 more in the bin."" So, the order is: sold 3, then added 10.

So, the sequence is: 4 books, minus 3 sold, plus 10 added. So, 4 - 3 = 1, then 1 + 10 = 11.

Hmm, yes, that makes sense.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in these problems, the numbers can be tricky. Maybe the 10 more are added before the selling? Let me check the wording again.

""If they sold 3 books, but then put 10 more in the bin.""

No, it says they sold 3 first, then put 10 more. So the order is clear.

Alternatively, maybe the 10 more are in addition to the 3 sold? But that wouldn't make much sense because you can't sell 3 and add 10 on top of that. It's more like after selling, they added 10 more.

So, let me confirm:

Start: 4 in bin.

After selling 3: 4 - 3 = 1 in bin.

After adding 10: 1 + 10 = 11.

Therefore, the bin would have 11 books.

Wait, but is there another way to interpret this? Maybe the 10 are in addition to the 3? Like, total books sold and added?

But the problem says ""they sold 3 books, but then put 10 more in the bin."" So, the 10 are added after the sale. So, the 10 are not part of the sold books.

So, it's 4 minus 3 sold, then plus 10 added.

So, 4 - 3 = 1, then 1 + 10 = 11.

Alternatively, if the 10 were in addition to the 3, then total would be 4 - 3 + 10 = 11 as well. Wait, that's the same result.

Wait, no. Let me see: if the 10 were in addition to the 3, that would mean 4 - 3 + 10 = 11. But in this case, the 10 are added after the sale, not in addition to the sold books.

But in either case, the result is 11. So, maybe the problem is straightforward.

But let me think again: is the 10 more added in addition to the 3 sold? Or is it just adding 10 after the 3 were sold?

If the 10 are added after the sale, then the total is 11.

If the 10 were added in addition to the 3, that would mean the total books are 3 sold and 10 added, making 13, but that's not the case here.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

If the 10 are added in addition",11,11.0,10.0

                 Okay, so Mike earned $42 over the summer from mowing lawns. But he spent $10 on buying new mower blades. Now, he wants to know how many $8 games he could buy with the money he has left. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out how much money Mike has left after buying the mower blades. He started with $42 and spent $10, so I subtract 10 from 42. That gives me 42 minus 10 equals 32. So Mike has $32 left.

Now, he wants to buy $8 games. To find out how many he can buy, I should divide the amount he has left by the cost per game. So that's 32 divided by 8. Let me calculate that: 32 ÷ 8 is 4. So Mike can buy 4 games.

Wait, let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting amount is $42, subtract the $10 gives $32. Then, $32 divided by $8 per game is indeed 4. Yep, that seems right.

Mike earned $42 from mowing lawns. He spent $10 on mower blades, leaving him with:

                 I need to figure out the problem step by step, even if I make mistakes, but then correct them. So, let me try to understand the problem.

First, the problem is about April's flower discount sale. It says April's ? discount flowers was having : a ; sale ; where each flower was ; 8 dollars. Hmm, the punctuation is a bit confusing here, but I think it means that the sale was offering a discount on flowers, each flower was priced at $8.

Then, the question is, if Vanessa bought 3 roses and 3 daisies, how much did she spend? So, Vanessa bought two types of flowers: roses and daisies.

Wait, but the problem says April's ? discount flowers was having : a ; sale ; where each flower was ; 8 dollars. So, perhaps the question is about whether the discount applies per flower or per type? Or maybe it's a typo, and the discount is on the total?

Wait, the original question is a bit unclear because of the punctuation. Let me try to parse it again.

Original problem:

April's ? discount flowers was having : a ; sale ; where each flower was ; 8 dollars. If Vanessa bought 3 roses and 3 daisies, how much did she spend?

I think the problem is that April is offering a discount on flowers, and each flower is priced at $8. But perhaps the discount is on the total purchase or per flower. The question is about Vanessa's purchase, so maybe the discount is applied per flower, or maybe it's a bulk discount.

But wait, the problem is written with some odd punctuation, so maybe the meaning is that each flower was priced at $8, and there was a discount applied. So, perhaps each flower was on sale for $8 with a discount.

Wait, perhaps the discount is on the total. Maybe the original price was higher, and each flower was being sold for $8 with a discount, so perhaps the discount is a percentage off the original price.

Wait, but the problem is a bit unclear. Let me try to rephrase it.

It says April's ? discount flowers was having : a ; sale ; where each flower was ; 8 dollars. So perhaps the discount is applied to each flower, each flower was priced at $8, and there was a discount, so each flower costs $8 with the discount. So, perhaps the discount is a fixed amount, but more likely a percentage.

Wait, maybe the problem is that each flower was priced at $8, and there was a discount, so the price per flower is $8 minus some discount. But without knowing the discount rate, I can't compute the exact price.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that each flower was on sale for $8, and there's a discount, but maybe the discount is a certain percentage, but the problem doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that each flower was priced at $8, and the discount applies to the total purchase, not per flower.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that each flower was priced at $8, but with a discount, so maybe each flower was $8, and the discount was, say, $2, making each flower $6, but again, without knowing the discount, I can't compute.

Wait, maybe the problem is that each flower was priced at $8, but the discount was a certain percentage. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the discount is a flat rate, like $1 off per flower, but again, the problem isn't clear.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again.

""April's ? discount flowers was having : a ; sale ; where each flower was ; 8 dollars. If Vanessa bought 3 roses and 3 daisies, how much did she spend?""

Wait, perhaps the question is that each flower was priced at $8, and the discount is a certain percentage, but maybe it's a typo, and the problem is that each flower was priced at $8, and the discount was 10%, so each flower is $8 * 0.9 = $7.20, but without knowing the discount rate, I can't be sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that each flower was priced at $8, and there was a discount, but perhaps the discount is only on certain types of flowers, but the problem doesn't specify.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that each flower was priced at $8, and the discount was a flat rate, say $1 off, making each flower $7, but again, without knowing the discount, I can't compute.

Wait, maybe the problem is that each flower was priced at $8, and the discount was a percentage, but the problem is missing information. So perhaps the problem is mistyped, and the intended discount was",48,48.0,8.0

First, I need to determine the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded. She uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera, so the total is 5 + 35 = 40 pictures.

Next, she sorted these pictures into 8 different albums, with the same number of pictures in each album. Let's denote the number of pictures in each album as x.

Since there are 8 albums and each has x pictures, the total number of pictures can also be expressed as 8x.

Setting the two expressions for the total number of pictures equal to each other gives the equation 8x = 40.

To find the value of x, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 8:
x = 40 / 8
x = 5

Therefore, each album contains 5 pictures.
</think>

**Solution:**

Olivia uploaded a total of \(5\) pictures from her phone and \(35\) pictures from her camera. Therefore, the total number of pictures is:
\[
5 + 35 = 40 \text{ pictures}
\]

She sorted these pictures into \(8\) different albums, with the same number of pictures in each album. Let \(x\) be the number of pictures in each album. Since there are \(8\) albums, the total number of pictures can also be expressed as:
\[
8x
\]

Setting the two expressions for the total number of pictures equal to each other:
\[
8x = 40
\]

To find \(x\), divide both sides by \(8\):
\[
x = \frac{40}{8} = 5

Therefore, each album contains \(5\) pictures.

                    .  Robin was making baggies of cookies ? with 6 : cookies in ; each bag. If she , had 23 chocolate chip , cookies and ? 25 : oatmeal cookies, how ; many baggies could she make? 
                


</think>
Okay, so Robin is making baggies of cookies. She has two types of cookies: chocolate chip and oatmeal. I need to figure out how many baggies she can make in total. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should figure out how many of each type of cookie she has. The problem says she has 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies. So, she has a total of 23 + 25 cookies. Let me add those up: 23 + 25 equals 48 cookies in total.

Now, each baggy can hold 6 cookies. I need to find out how many baggies she can make with 48 cookies. To do this, I'll divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies each baggy can hold. So, that's 48 divided by 6. Let me calculate that: 48 ÷ 6 equals 8. That means she can make 8 baggies.

Wait, but I should also consider if there's a different way to approach this, maybe by calculating how many bags she can make from each type of cookie separately and then seeing the limiting factor. Let me try that.

For the chocolate chip cookies: she has 23, and each baggy holds 6. So, 23 ÷ 6 is approximately 3.833. But since you can't make a fraction of a baggy, she can only make 3 full baggies from the chocolate chip cookies.

For the oatmeal cookies: she has 25, and again, each baggy holds 6. So, 25 ÷ 6 is approximately 4.166. So, she can make 4 full baggies from the oatmeal cookies.

Now, between the two, the chocolate chip cookies limit her to 3 baggies, and the oatmeal cookies allow for 4. So, the total number of baggies she can make is the smaller number, which is 3.

Wait, that doesn't match my first calculation where I added them up and got 8 baggies. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me think again. If she has 23 chocolate chip and 25 oatmeal cookies, and each baggy holds 6, regardless of the type, then the total number of cookies is 23 + 25 = 48. Divided by 6, that's 8 baggies. So, she can make 8 baggies in total, using all the cookies.

But when I considered the individual types, I got 3 and 4, which are less than 8. That doesn't make sense because she can't make more baggies than the individual cookie counts allow. So, I must have confused myself.

Wait, no. Actually, if she's making baggies that can have any combination of cookies, then the limiting factor is the total number of cookies, not the individual types. So, 48 cookies divided by 6 per baggy gives 8 baggies, regardless of the types. So, the initial approach was correct.

I think the confusion came when I considered the individual types, but since each baggy can have a mix of both types, the total number of cookies determines the number of baggies. So, 8 baggies is the correct answer.

Therefore, the final answer is that Robin can make 8 baggies.
</think>

Robin can make 8 baggies of cookies in total.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     ! Cody had 45 . dollars. For his birthday he got , 9 more dollars ; but , spent . 19 on ? a new game. How , much money does he have now? 
                 Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Cody has now after his birthday and some spending. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, Cody started with 45 dollars. Then he got 9 more dollars for his birthday. So I should add those two amounts together to find out how much he had after receiving the birthday money.

45 dollars plus 9 dollars is... let me calculate that. 45 plus 9 is 54. So he now has 54 dollars.

But then he spent 19 dollars on a new game. Hmm, okay, so after getting 54 dollars, he spent some of it. I need to subtract the amount he spent from the total he had after the birthday.

So, 54 dollars minus 19 dollars. Let me do that subtraction. 54 minus 19 is... 35. So he has 35 dollars left.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 45, adding 9 gives 54. Then subtracting 19 from 54. 54 minus 10 is 44, and then minus 9 more is 35. Yeah, that seems right.

So, putting it all together: he started with 45, got 9 more, making it 54, then spent 19, ending up with 35. So he has 35 dollars left now.
</think>

Cody started with 45 dollars. After receiving 9 more dollars for his birthday, he had a total of 54 dollars. He then spent 19 dollars on a new game, leaving him with 35 dollars.

                    question:

                 Okay, so I need to figure out how many pictures were in each of the four albums Wendy created. She uploaded a total of 22 pictures from her phone and 2 from her camera to Facebook. Then she sorted them into four different albums, each with the same number of pictures. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me get the total number of pictures she uploaded. She uploaded 22 from her phone and 2 from her camera. So, 22 plus 2 is 24 pictures in total. Got that. Now, she sorted these 24 pictures into four different albums, and each album has the same number of pictures. So, I need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find out how many pictures are in each album.

Let me do that calculation: 24 divided by 4 is 6. So, each album should have 6 pictures. Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If each album has 6 pictures, then four albums would have 4 times 6, which is 24 pictures. That matches the total number of pictures she uploaded. Okay, that seems right.

But wait, let me think again. Sometimes these problems can be tricky. She uploaded 22 from her phone and 2 from her camera. So, does that mean she has different categories of pictures? Like, some are from her phone and some from her camera. So, does that affect how she sorts them into albums?

Hmm, the problem doesn't specify that she sorted them based on the source, like separating phone and camera pictures into different albums. It just says she sorted the pictures into four different albums, each with the same number of pictures. So, it's possible that she mixed all the pictures together when sorting them into albums.

So, in that case, the total is 24, divided equally into four albums, each with 6 pictures. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. If she had separate categories, like 22 from phone and 2 from camera, maybe she distributed them in a different way. But the problem doesn't specify any constraints on how the pictures are distributed among the albums beyond each album having the same number of pictures.

So, it's safer to assume that all 24 pictures are randomly or uniformly distributed into the four albums, each having 6 pictures. Therefore, each album would have 6 pictures.

Wait another thought: could she have more than one picture from each source in each album? Or is it possible that the distribution affects the count? But since the problem doesn't specify any constraints beyond the total and the number of albums, I think my initial conclusion holds.

So, each album has 6 pictures. Therefore, the answer is 6 pictures in each of the four albums.
</think>

Wendy uploaded a total of 24 pictures (22 from her phone and 2 from her camera) and distributed them equally into 4 albums. Each album contains 24 divided by 4, which is 6 pictures.

</think><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of candy pieces Katie and her sister have combined. Katie has 8 pieces and her sister has 23 pieces.

Next, I'll add these two amounts together to find the total. 8 plus 23 equals 31.

Then, I'll calculate how many candy pieces they ate on the first night. They ate 8 pieces.

Finally, to find out how many pieces are left, I'll subtract the number they ate from the total. 31 minus 8 equals 23.

Therefore, after eating 8 pieces on the first night, Katie and her sister have 23 pieces of candy left.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Total Candy Pieces:**
   - Katie has **8** pieces.
   - Her sister has **23** pieces.
   
   **Total = 8 + 23 = 31** pieces.

2. **Candy Eaten on the First Night:**
   - They ate **8** pieces.

3. **Candy Left After the First Night:**
   
   **Candy Left = Total Candy Pieces - Candy Eaten**
   
   **Candy Left = 31 - 8 = 23** pieces.

                 Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many cages the pet store used. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The pet store had 88 puppies. In one day, they sold 34 of them and put the rest into cages with 6 in each cage. How many cages did they use?

Alright, so let's break this down. First, they started with 88 puppies. Then they sold 34, so how many are left? I think I need to subtract the number sold from the total. So, 88 minus 34. Let me calculate that.

88 minus 34 is... 54. So, 54 puppies are left.

Now, these remaining 54 puppies are being put into cages, with 6 in each cage. So, I need to figure out how many cages are needed to hold 54 puppies if each cage can only have 6. That sounds like a division problem. If I divide the number of puppies by the number per cage, the result should be the number of cages.

So, 54 divided by 6. Let me do that division. 6 goes into 54 how many times? 6 times 9 is 54, so that's 9 cages.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, total puppies are 88. Sold 34, so 88 minus 34 is indeed 54. Then, 54 divided by 6 is 9. That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. If each cage holds 6 puppies, then the number of cages is the total puppies after sale divided by 6. So, 54 divided by 6 is 9. Yep, that's consistent.

I don't think there's any trick here or anything. It's straightforward division after subtracting the number sold. So, the answer should be 9 cages.

**Final Answer**
The pet store used \boxed{9} cages.
</think>

The pet store started with 88 puppies. They sold 34 of them, so the remaining puppies are calculated as follows:

\[ 88 - 34 = 54 \]

These 54 puppies are placed into cages with 6 puppies each. To find the number of cages needed, we divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage:

\[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]

Thus, the number of cages used is \boxed{9}.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",9,9.0,9.0

                    question:
                     , Jerry : was helping , the cafeteria . workers pick up : lunch trays, ; but he could : only carry 8 trays at a time. ? If he had : to pick up 9 trays from one ? table and 7 trays from , another, how many trips will he ! make? ? 
                 Alright, so I have this problem here where Jerry is helping cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays. He can only carry 8 trays at a time. The question is asking how many trips he'll make if he has to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. Jerry can carry 8 trays each trip. There are two tables: one has 9 trays and the other has 7 trays. So, he needs to pick up all these trays. But he can only carry 8 at a time. So, I guess he has to make multiple trips.

Let me break it down. Starting with the table that has 9 trays. Since he can carry 8 at a time, he'll need to make at least two trips here. On the first trip, he picks up 8 trays. Then, on the second trip, he picks up the remaining 1 tray. So that's two trips for the first table.

Now, moving on to the second table with 7 trays. Since 7 is less than 8, he can pick up all 7 trays in one trip. So that's just one trip for the second table.

Wait, but does he have to go back and forth between the tables? Or can he carry trays from both tables in a single trip? Hmm, that's an important point.

The problem doesn't specify whether he can combine trips, meaning he could pick up some trays from one table and some from another in a single trip. But usually, in these types of problems, you assume that he can only carry trays from one table at a time because he can't carry multiple loads simultaneously. So, he has to make separate trips for each table.

So, let me recalculate. For the first table, he needs two trips: one with 8 trays and another with 1 tray. For the second table, he just needs one trip to carry all 7 trays. So, in total, that would be 2 + 1 = 3 trips.

Wait, but is there a more efficient way? Maybe if he can combine the trips, he can minimize the total number. Let me think about that.

If he can carry 8 trays, but needs to pick up 9 from one table and 7 from another, can he somehow combine the trips? For example, on his first trip, he could take 8 trays from the first table. Then, on his second trip, he takes 7 trays from the second table. Then, on his third trip, he goes back to the first table to pick up the remaining 1 tray. That would still be 3 trips.

Alternatively, could he take some trays from both tables in a single trip? Let me see. He can carry 8 trays at a time. So, if he takes, say, 7 trays from the first table and 1 tray from the second table, that's 8 trays total. Then, on his next trip, he takes the remaining 2 trays from the first table and 0 from the second. That would be two trips. Wait, but that's only if he can combine the trips.

But the problem doesn't specify whether he can carry trays from both tables in a single trip. In most similar problems, you can't carry from multiple tables in a single trip because each trip is to a single table. So, he has to make separate trips for each table.

Therefore, for the first table, he makes two trips: 8 and 1. For the second table, one trip. So, total of 3 trips.

Wait, but let me double-check. If he can combine trips, he could do it in two trips. For example, first trip: 8 from table A and 0 from table B. Second trip: 1 from table A and 7 from table B. So that would be two trips. But does the problem allow that? It just says he can carry 8 trays at a time. It doesn't specify whether he can split the load between tables.

I think in most cases, unless specified otherwise, you have to assume that he can't carry from both tables in a single trip. So, he must make separate trips for each table. So, three trips total.

But just to be thorough, let me consider both scenarios.

First scenario: He can only carry from one table per trip.

So, table A: 9 trays. He can carry 8 on the first trip, leaving 1. Then another trip to carry the last one. So, two trips for table A.

Table B: 7 trays. He can carry all 7 in one trip. So, one trip.

Total trips: 2 + 1 = 3.

                 Okay, let me try to figure out Faye's score. So, Faye is playing a video game where she gets 7 points for each treasure she finds. 

First, she found 2 treasures on the first level. Hmm, so I should multiply the number of treasures by the points per treasure. That would be 2 times 7. Let me write that down: 2 * 7 = 14 points from the first level.

Next, she found 6 treasures on the second level. Okay, so again, I need to multiply the number of treasures by 7. So, 6 * 7. Hmm, what's 6 times 7? Let me calculate that. 6*7 is 42. So, she gets 42 points from the second level.

Now, to find her total score, I should add the points from both levels together. That means adding 14 and 42. Let me do that: 14 + 42 = 56. So, her total score should be 56 points.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. She found 2 treasures on the first level, 2*7 is 14, that's correct. Then, 6 treasures on the second level, 6*7 is 42, that adds up. Adding those together, 14+42 is definitely 56. Yeah, that seems right. So, Faye's total score is 56.
</think>

Faye's score is calculated by adding the points from each level.

1. First level: 2 treasures × 7 points = 14 points.
2. Second level: 6 treasures × 7 points = 42 points.

I need to determine the total number of carrots Megan has after her two days of picking and discarding some.

First, Megan picked 19 carrots on the first day. She then threw out 4 of them, so she has 15 carrots left after the first day.

                 {The final answer is}
</think>

Alright, let's try to figure out how many groups the coach needs to form. So, we have a baseball team with 12 new players and 44 returning players. That means the total number of players on the team is 12 + 44. Let me write that down.

12 new players + 44 returning players = 56 total players.

Okay, now the coach wants to put all these players into groups, and each group should have 8 players. Hmm, so if each group has 8 players, how many groups will there be? Well, I think this is a division problem. If I divide the total number of players by the number of players per group, that should give me the number of groups.

So, total players = 56, and players per group = 8. Let me do that division.

56 ÷ 8 = ?

Let me calculate that. 8 goes into 56 seven times because 8 times 7 is 56. Wait, no, 8 times 7 is actually 56. So, 56 divided by 8 is 7. That means there are 7 groups.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If there are 7 groups with 8 players each, then 7 groups × 8 players = 56 players. That matches the total number of players we have. So, it seems correct.

I don't think there are any other considerations here, like different group sizes or anything. The problem just says each group has 8 players, so it's straightforward division.

So, yeah, the coach needs to form 7 groups.

The number of groups is \boxed{7}.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",7,7.0,7.0

                 Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to figure out how many $9 games Will could buy with the money he has left after buying a mower and mower blades. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand the given information. Will made $104 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. So, he has $104 initially. Then, he spent $41 dollars buying new mower blades. Hmm, so he used some of his money to buy these blades.

Now, I need to find out how much money he has left after this purchase. To do that, I can subtract the amount he spent on the blades from his initial amount. So, $104 minus $41. Let me calculate that.

$104 - $41 = ?

Let me subtract step by step. 104 minus 40 is 64, and then minus 1 more is 63. So, he has $63 left.

Now, the question is how many $9 games he can buy with the remaining money. So, he has $63, and each game costs $9. To find out how many games he can buy, I need to divide the total money he has by the cost per game.

So, $63 divided by $9. Let me compute that.

63 divided by 9. Hmm, 9 times 7 is 63, right? So, 7 games.

Wait, let me verify that. 7 times 9 is 63, yes. So, he can buy 7 games.

Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make arithmetic errors, so better safe than sorry.

Starting again, he had $104. He spent $41 on blades. So, 104 minus 41. Let me do it another way. 41 plus 63 equals 104, right? So, yes, he has $63 left.

Then, 63 divided by 9. Well, 9 times 7 is 63. So, 7 games. That seems correct.

Is there any other information I might have missed? Let me read the problem again.

""Will made $104 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent $41 dollars buying new mower blades, how many $9 games could he buy with the money he had left?""

So, initial amount: $104. Expenditure: $41. So, remaining: $63. Each game costs $9. 63 divided by 9 is 7. So, 7 games.

I think that's all. I don't see any other factors mentioned, like taxes or other expenses. So, I think 7 is the correct number.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as total money minus blades cost equals money left, then money left divided by game cost gives the number of games. So, (104 - 41)/9 = 63/9 = 7.

Yeah, that seems consistent.

Wait, just to be thorough, let me represent it with variables.

Let me denote:

Total money = T = $104.

Amount spent on blades = S = $41.

Money left = T - S.

Number of games = (T - S) / Cost per game.

Cost per game = C = $9.

Number of games = (104 - 41)/9 = 63/9 = 7.

So, same result.

Therefore, I'm confident the answer is 7 games.
</think>

Will initially has $104. He spends $41 on mower blades, leaving him with $63. He can buy 63 divided by 9, which is 7 games.

First, Nancy picked 12 carrots from her garden.

She threw out 2 of them.

This means she has 12 minus 2, which equals 10 carrots remaining.

The next day, she picked 21 more carrots.

To find the total number of carrots she has, I add the remaining carrots from the first day to the new carrots picked the next day.

So, 10 plus 21 equals 31.

Therefore, Nancy has a total of 31 carrots.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Initial Carrots Picked:**
   - Nancy initially picked **12 carrots**.

2. **Carrots Thrown Out:**
   - She threw out **2 carrots**.
   - Remaining carrots after throwing out: \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) carrots.

3. **Carrots Picked the Next Day:**
   - Nancy picked **21 more carrots** the next day.
   - Total carrots after picking the next day: \( 10 + 21 = 31 \) carrots.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     A worksheet : had 4 problems : on it. , If ! a ? teacher had 16 worksheets to grade and had already . graded ! 8 of them, how many more problems does she have ? to ; grade? 
                 Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out how many more problems a teacher has to grade. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that there's a worksheet with 4 problems on it. Hmm, okay, so each worksheet has 4 problems. Got that. Then it mentions that the teacher had 16 worksheets to grade. So, the teacher has 16 different worksheets, each with 4 problems.

Now, the teacher has already graded 8 of them. So, out of the 16 worksheets, 8 are already graded. That leaves how many ungraded worksheets? Let me subtract 8 from 16. 16 minus 8 is 8. So, there are 8 worksheets left that the teacher hasn't graded yet.

Each of these remaining 8 worksheets has 4 problems. So, to find out how many problems there are to grade, I need to multiply the number of ungraded worksheets by the number of problems per worksheet. That would be 8 times 4.

Wait, 8 times 4... 8 times 4 is 32. So, the teacher has 32 problems left to grade.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The teacher had 16 worksheets, each with 4 problems. She graded 8 worksheets, so 8 times 4 is 32 problems she's already graded. Therefore, the remaining problems are 32. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, putting it all together, the teacher has 8 ungraded worksheets, each with 4 problems, so 8 times 4 is 32. Therefore, she has 32 more problems to grade.

I think that's it. I don't see any other factors or steps involved here. It's straightforward multiplication once you figure out how many are left and then how many problems each of those has.
</think>

The teacher has 16 worksheets, each with 4 problems. She has already graded 8 worksheets. Therefore, the number of ungraded problems is calculated as follows:

Number of ungraded worksheets = Total worksheets - Graded worksheets = 16 - 8 = 8

Each ungraded worksheet has 4 problems, so the total number of problems to grade is:

Total problems to grade = Number of ungraded worksheets × Problems per worksheet = 8 × 4 = 32

</think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how many pieces of winter clothing Paige has in total. So, the problem says that Paige found 6 boxes of clothing. Inside each box, there are 5 scarves and 5 mittens. I need to find the total number of winter clothing pieces she has.

First, I should break down what's in each box. Each box has 5 scarves and 5 mittens. So, that's 5 scarves + 5 mittens per box. Wait, but the question is about the total number of pieces of winter clothing. So, I guess each scarf and each mitten is considered a piece of clothing.

Since there are 6 boxes, I can calculate the total scarves and total mittens separately and then add them together.

Let me start with the scarves. Each box has 5 scarves, and there are 6 boxes. So, the total number of scarves is 5 scarves/box multiplied by 6 boxes. That would be 5 * 6 = 30 scarves.

Now, for the mittens. Each box also has 5 mittens, and there are 6 boxes. So, the total number of mittens is 5 mittens/box multiplied by 6 boxes, which is 5 * 6 = 30 mittens.

Now, to find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, I need to add the total scarves and total mittens together. So, that would be 30 scarves + 30 mittens = 60 pieces of winter clothing.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Each box has 5 scarves and 5 mittens, so 10 pieces per box. With 6 boxes, that would be 10 * 6 = 60 pieces. Yep, that matches my previous calculation. So, the total is 60.
</think>

Paige found 6 boxes, each containing 5 scarves and 5 mittens. Therefore, the total number of scarves is 5 × 6 = 30, and the total number of mittens is also 5 × 6 = 30. Adding these together, the total number of pieces of winter clothing is 30 + 30 = 60.

                 I need to solve this problem step by step. I'll write down all the information and then figure out the solution.
</think>
Alright, so I have this problem here where a chef needs to cook 12 potatoes. He's already cooked 6, and each potato takes 6 minutes to cook. I need to figure out how long it will take him to cook the remaining potatoes. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should determine how many potatoes are left to cook. The chef has already cooked 6 out of 12, so I subtract 6 from 12. That gives me 6 potatoes remaining. Okay, so there are 6 potatoes left.

Next, I need to find out how long it takes to cook one potato. The problem says each potato takes 6 minutes to cook. So, one potato takes 6 minutes. Now, since there are 6 potatoes left, I need to calculate the total cooking time for all of them.

To find the total time, I multiply the number of potatoes left by the time it takes to cook one potato. So, that's 6 potatoes multiplied by 6 minutes each. Let me do that multiplication: 6 times 6 is 36. So, 36 minutes in total.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 12 potatoes minus 6 cooked equals 6 remaining. Each potato takes 6 minutes, so 6 times 6 is indeed 36 minutes. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think there's anything else to it. The problem doesn't mention anything about overlapping cooking times or whether the chef can cook multiple potatoes at once. It just asks for the total time to cook the remaining potatoes. So, it's straightforward multiplication after determining the number of potatoes left.

Hmm, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by finding the rate of cooking? Let me see. If one potato takes 6 minutes, then the chef can cook one potato every 6 minutes. So, the rate is one potato per 6 minutes. To cook 6 potatoes, it would take 6 times 6, which is 36 minutes. Yep, same result.

Alternatively, I could think in terms of fractions. If one potato takes 6 minutes, then half a potato would take 3 minutes, and so on. But since we have a whole number of potatoes left, it's easier to just multiply.

I guess another way to look at it is by using the concept of time per task. Each potato is a task that takes 6 minutes. So, with 6 tasks left, the total time is 6 times 6, which is 36 minutes.

I don't think there's any need to consider cooking times for multiple potatoes simultaneously. The problem doesn't specify if the chef can cook multiple at once or if he has only one burner or something. It just says each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, so I assume it's one after another.

So, to summarize: 12 potatoes total, 6 already cooked, 6 left. Each takes 6 minutes, so total time is 36 minutes. I think that's the answer.
</think>

To determine how long it will take the chef to cook the remaining potatoes, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of potatoes remaining to cook:**
   - Total potatoes needed: 12
   - Already cooked: 6
   - Potatoes left = 12 - 6 = 6

2. **Determine the total cooking time for the remaining potatoes:**
   - Time per potato: 6 minutes
   - Total time = Number of potatoes left × Time per potato = 6 × 6 = 36 minutes

**Final Answer:** It will take the chef 36 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes. {The final answer is}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",36,36.0,36.0

                 Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, Luke is selling his old games. He started with 57 games but sold 39 of them. Hmm, so first I need to find out how many games he has left after selling 39. That should be 57 minus 39. Let me do that subtraction: 57 minus 39 equals 18. So, he has 18 games left.

Now, he packed the rest up, putting 2 games into each box. I need to find out how many boxes he used. Since each box holds 2 games, I can divide the number of remaining games by 2 to find the number of boxes. So, 18 games divided by 2 games per box equals 9 boxes. Wait, but is that all? Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't miss anything.

He started with 57, sold 39, so 57 minus 39 is definitely 18. Then, packing 2 games each box, so 18 divided by 2 is 9. Yeah, that seems right. So, he used 9 boxes. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key steps were calculating the remaining games and then determining the number of boxes needed based on the packing rate.
</think>

To determine how many boxes Luke used, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining games after selling 39:**
   - Total games initially = 57
   - Games sold = 39
   - Remaining games = 57 - 39 = 18

2. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   - Each box holds 2 games.
   - Number of boxes = Remaining games ÷ Games per box = 18 ÷ 2 = 9

                 Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, Faye and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Faye picked 23 carrots, and her mom picked 5. Then it says if only 12 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?

Hmm, wait, let me break this down. First, Faye picked 23 carrots, and her mom picked 5. So, the total number of carrots they picked together would be 23 plus 5, which is 28. Is that right? Yeah, 23 plus 5 is 28.

Now, the problem says if only 12 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have? So, out of all the carrots they picked, 12 are good. That means the rest must be bad. So, if the total is 28, and 12 are good, then the bad ones would be 28 minus 12. Let me do that math: 28 minus 12 is 16. So, that would mean there are 16 bad carrots.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I interpret the question correctly? The problem says ""Faye and her mom were picking carrots from their garden."" So, they picked carrots together, right? So, Faye picked 23, her mom picked 5, so total is 28. If 12 are good, subtract 12 from 28, you get 16 bad.

Alternatively, could it be that the good carrots are only 12, meaning Faye and her mom picked 28, but only 12 are good. So, the bad ones are 28 minus 12, which is 16. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think there's any trick here. It's straightforward subtraction. So, 28 total carrots minus 12 good ones equals 16 bad carrots.

I guess I'm overcomplicating it, but just to make sure, let's visualize it. Imagine they have a garden with 28 carrots. 12 are good, 16 are bad. Faye picked 23, so she must have picked some good and some bad. Her mom picked 5, which could be all good or some bad. But since we don't need to know how many each picked, just the total bad, the subtraction is straightforward.

So, yeah, the answer should be 16 bad carrots.
</think>

The total number of carrots picked is 23 (Faye) + 5 (mother) = 28. If 12 are good, then bad carrots are 28 - 12 = 16.

Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Isabel picked 66 flowers for her friend's wedding. She was making bouquets, each with 8 flowers. But 10 of the flowers wilted before the wedding. I need to find out how many bouquets she could still make.

Alright, let's break it down. First, she started with 66 flowers. Then, out of those, 10 wilted. So, how many flowers does she have left? Well, if she started with 66 and lost 10, that should be 66 minus 10. Let me calculate that: 66 minus 10 is 56. So, she has 56 flowers left.

Now, each bouquet requires 8 flowers. She wants to make as many bouquets as possible from the remaining 56 flowers. So, how many groups of 8 can she make from 56? Hmm, that's a division problem. I need to divide 56 by 8. 

Let me do that division. 8 goes into 56 how many times? Well, 8 times 7 is 56. So, 56 divided by 8 is 7. That means she can make 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Did I account for all the flowers correctly? She had 66, 10 wilted, so 56 left. Each bouquet is 8, so 56 divided by 8 is 7. Yeah, that seems right. 

Is there another way to think about it? Maybe subtract the number of bouquets she would have made originally from the 10 wilted. But no, that doesn't make much sense because the bouquets are made after the flowers wilt. So, it's better to subtract the wilted flowers first and then see how many bouquets she can make.

So, yeah, 66 minus 10 is 56, and 56 divided by 8 is 7. So, she can make 7 bouquets. I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
Isabel could still make \boxed{7} bouquets.
</think>

Isabel started with 66 flowers. After 10 flowers wilted, she had 66 - 10 = 56 flowers left. Each bouquet requires 8 flowers, so she divided the remaining 56 flowers by 8 to find the number of bouquets she could make. 

56 divided by 8 equals 7. Therefore, Isabel could still make 7 bouquets.

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times and the bumper cars 4 times. Each ride costs 7 tickets. How many tickets did he use?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Information:**
   - Oliver took two types of rides: ferris wheel and bumper cars.
   - He rode the ferris wheel 5 times.
   - He rode the bumper cars 4 times.
   - Each ride costs 7 tickets.

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Rides:**
   - Ferris wheel rides: 5
   - Bumper cars rides: 4
   - **Total rides = 5 + 4 = 9 rides**

3. **Determine the Total Cost in Tickets:**
   - Each ride costs 7 tickets.
   - **Total tickets used = Number of rides × Cost per ride = 9 × 7**

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - 9 × 7 = 63

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Oliver used **63 tickets**.

                    question:

                 Correct the sentence and solve the problem.
</think>
Alright, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Wendy bought 4 new chairs and 4 new tables. She spent 6 minutes on each piece of furniture putting it together. I need to find out how many minutes it took her to finish all of them.

First, I should probably figure out how many pieces of furniture she has in total. She bought 4 chairs and 4 tables. So, chairs plus tables would be 4 + 4. Let me add that up: 4 plus 4 is 8. So, she has 8 pieces of furniture.

Now, she spent 6 minutes on each piece. Hmm, so if she worked on each piece one after another, I guess I need to multiply the number of pieces by the time she spent on each. That way, I can find the total time.

So, the calculation would be: 8 pieces multiplied by 6 minutes per piece. Let me write that out: 8 × 6. Hmm, 8 times 6 is 48. So, does that mean it took her 48 minutes?

Wait, but sometimes when you're dealing with time, especially if you can do multiple things at once, the total time might be less. But the problem doesn't mention anything about working simultaneously or having multiple people helping. It just says she spent 6 minutes on each piece, putting it together. So, I think it's safe to assume she worked on each piece one after another, meaning the total time is indeed the number of pieces multiplied by the time per piece.

Let me double-check that. If she had 8 pieces and spent 6 minutes on each, doing one at a time, then yes, 8 times 6 is 48 minutes. That makes sense.

I don't see any other way to interpret the problem, so I think 48 minutes is the correct answer.
</think>

Wendy bought 4 chairs and 4 tables, totaling 8 pieces of furniture. She spent 6 minutes on each piece. Therefore, the total time is 8 pieces × 6 minutes per piece = 48 minutes.

                    question:
                     The ! cafeteria had 50 : apples. : For lunch . they . handed ? out ! 5 to students and decided to use the rest ! to ! make pies. If each pie takes 5 ! apples, how many pies could they make? 
                 Alright, so I have this problem here about the cafeteria having 50 apples. They give out 5 apples to each student, and then use the rest to make pies, each pie requiring 5 apples. I need to figure out how many pies they can make. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to know how many students they gave apples to. Wait, the problem says ""For lunch, they handed out 5 to students."" Does that mean each student got 5 apples, or 5 apples in total? The wording is a bit unclear. Let me read it again. It says ""they handed out 5 to students."" Hmm, maybe it's 5 apples per student. So if there are multiple students, I need to know the number of students to subtract from the total apples.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify how many students. That's a problem. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think. The total apples are 50. They gave out 5 to students. So perhaps the number of apples given out is 5 per student, but without knowing how many students, I can't subtract. Maybe the problem is intended to be that they gave out 5 apples in total, not per student. That would make more sense because otherwise, without knowing the number of students, we can't proceed.

So, if it's 5 apples total given out, then the remaining apples would be 50 minus 5, which is 45. Then, each pie requires 5 apples, so 45 divided by 5 is 9. So they can make 9 pies. That seems straightforward.

But wait, the original problem says ""5 to students,"" which could imply 5 per student. If that's the case, how many students are there? The problem doesn't specify. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps ""they"" refers to the cafeteria staff, and ""handed out 5 to students,"" meaning 5 apples per student. But without knowing how many students, I can't subtract.

Alternatively, maybe ""they"" refers to the number of pies, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the problem is about the number of pies they can make after giving out apples to students. So, the key is to figure out how many apples are left after giving out 5 to each student, but since the number of students isn't given, perhaps it's a typo or misinterpretation.

Wait, another angle: maybe ""they handed 5 out"" refers to 5 pies, but no, the problem says apples. Hmm. Maybe the problem is in another language and the translation is a bit off. Let me check the original problem again.

The problem says: ""The cafeteria had 50 apples. For lunch, they handed 5 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 5 apples, how many pies could they make?""

So, ""handed 5 to students""—if it's 5 apples total, then 50-5=45 left. If it's 5 per student, then we need to know how many students. Since that's not given, maybe the problem assumes that the number of apples given out is 5, not per student. That would make the problem solvable without additional information.

Alternatively, maybe ""they"" refers to the number of pies, but that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe ""handed 5 to students"" means 5 apples each to students, but since the number of students isn't specified, perhaps the problem is intended to have a typo, and it should say ""handed 5 to each student,"" but it's unclear.

Given that, perhaps the intended interpretation is that they gave out 5 apples in total, so 50-5=45 apples left, and each pie requires 5 apples, so 45/5=9 pies.

Alternatively, if it's 5 apples per student, and the number of students is not given, the problem can't be solved. Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that they gave out 5 apples in total, leading to 45 apples left, which can make 9 pies.

So, I think the answer is 9 pies.

The cafeteria started with 50 apples. They gave out 5 apples in total to students, leaving 45 apples. Since each pie requires 5 apples, they can make 9 pies.

First, I note that the cafeteria initially has 14 apples.

They use 13 apples to make lunch, so I subtract 13 from the initial count.

After using 13 apples, the remaining apples are 14 minus 13, which equals 1 apple.

                 {
Alright, so I've got this problem here about Frank playing a trivia game. Let me try to figure out his final score step by step. Hmm, okay, first, I need to understand what the problem is saying.

So, Frank is playing a trivia game. In the first half, he answered 3 questions correctly, and in the second half, he got 2 right. Each question is worth 3 points. I need to calculate his total score.

Wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. It says ""While : playing ! a trivia game, ? Frank , answered 3 ; questions correct in the first half and 2 questions ? correct in the second half."" Okay, so he answered 3 correctly in the first half and 2 correctly in the second. Each question is worth 3 points.

So, I think I can break this down into two parts: the first half and the second half. Then, I can calculate the points from each and add them together.

First, the first half: he got 3 questions right. Each question is worth 3 points, so for the first half, he gets 3 multiplied by 3. Let me write that down: 3 correct * 3 points = 9 points.

Now, the second half: he got 2 questions correct. Again, each is worth 3 points. So, that's 2 * 3 = 6 points.

To find his total score, I add the points from both halves. So, 9 points + 6 points = 15 points.

Wait, is there anything else I need to consider? Like, did he answer any questions incorrectly? The problem doesn't mention penalties for wrong answers, so I think only the correct answers contribute positively to the score. So, no negative marks or anything.

Also, the problem doesn't specify the total number of questions in each half. It just says he answered 3 in the first half and 2 in the second. So, I don't need to worry about the total number of questions or anything like that.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. He got 3 right in the first half, each worth 3 points, so that's 9. He got 2 right in the second half, each worth 3, so that's 6. Total is 15. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think there are any trick elements here. It's straightforward addition after calculating points from correct answers. So, I'm pretty confident the final score is 15.
</think>

Frank's final score is calculated by determining the points from correct answers in each half of the trivia game and summing them.

First half:
- Correct answers: 3
- Points per correct answer: 3
- Total points from first half: 3 * 3 = 9

Second half:
- Correct answers: 2
- Points per correct answer: 3
- Total points from second half: 2 * 3 = 6

Total score:
- 9 (first half) + 6 (second half) = 15

First, I need to determine the total number of boxes Zoe found, which is 8 boxes.

Next, I'll calculate the number of scarves she found by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of scarves in each box: 8 boxes * 4 scarves per box = 32 scarves.

Then, I'll calculate the number of mittens by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of mittens in each box: 8 boxes * 6 mittens per box = 48 mittens.

Finally, I'll add the total number of scarves and mittens together to find the total number of pieces of winter clothing: 32 scarves + 48 mittens = 80 pieces of clothing.
</think>

Let's determine the total number of pieces of winter clothing Zoe has.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of boxes.**
Zoe found **8 boxes** of clothing.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of scarves.**
Each box contains **4 scarves**.
\[
\text{Total scarves} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Scarves per box} = 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ scarves}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of mittens.**
Each box contains **6 mittens**.
\[
\text{Total mittens} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Mittens per box} = 8 \times 6 = 48 \text{ mittens}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of pieces of winter clothing.**
\[
\text{Total clothing} = \text{Total scarves} + \text{Total mittens} = 32 + 48 = 80
\]

**Final Answer:**

                    question:
                     Frank ? and ? his . friend ! were buying , trick . decks from the magic shop for 7 ! dollars each. How much did they spend , if Frank , bought 3 decks and , his friend bought 2 decks? 
                 Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how much Frank and his friend spent buying magic decks. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says Frank and his friend were buying decks from a magic shop. Each deck costs 7 dollars. Frank bought 3 decks, and his friend bought 2 decks. I need to find the total amount they spent together.

Hmm, okay. So, the key pieces of information are:
- Price per deck: $7
- Number of decks Frank bought: 3
- Number of decks his friend bought: 2

I think the first step is to calculate how much Frank spent. Since each deck is $7, multiplying the number of decks by the price per deck should give the total cost. So for Frank, that's 3 decks multiplied by $7 per deck.

Let me write that down:
Frank's cost = 3 decks * $7/deck = $21.

Alright, that seems straightforward. Now, moving on to his friend. The friend bought 2 decks, so similarly, I should multiply the number of decks by the price per deck.

Friend's cost = 2 decks * $7/deck = $14.

Now, to find the total amount they spent together, I need to add Frank's cost and his friend's cost.

Total cost = Frank's cost + Friend's cost = $21 + $14.

Let me do that addition:
$21 plus $14. Hmm, 21 plus 10 is 31, and then plus 4 more is 35. So that's $35 total.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So 3 decks at $7 each: 3 times 7 is 21. 2 decks at $7 each: 2 times 7 is 14. Adding 21 and 14 gives 35. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think there's any trick here, like the decks being on sale or something. The problem doesn't mention any discounts or special offers, so I can safely ignore that possibility.

So, breaking it down:
- Frank buys 3 decks: 3 * 7 = 21.
- Friend buys 2 decks: 2 * 7 = 14.
- Total spent: 21 + 14 = 35.

Yep, that all adds up. I don't think I missed anything. The problem is pretty straightforward. It's just multiplication and addition, which are basic math operations, but it's easy to rush and make a mistake if you're not careful. But by taking it step by step, I avoided any errors.

I guess another way to look at it is to think of it as the total number of decks they bought together and then multiply by the price per deck. Let's try that method to confirm.

Total decks bought = 3 + 2 = 5 decks.
Total cost = 5 decks * $7/deck = $35.

Same result, so that's a good check. It doesn't matter whether I calculate each person's cost separately and add them or just calculate the total number of decks first and then multiply; both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.

I think that's all there is to it. The problem was designed to test basic multiplication and addition skills, making sure that even if you're buying multiple items, you can compute the total cost accurately.

So, just to recap:
- Calculate individual costs: 3*7=21, 2*7=14.
- Sum them: 21+14=35.
- Alternatively, sum the number of decks first: 5*7=35.

Either way, the total amount they spent is $35.
</think>

Frank bought 3 decks at $7 each, costing $21. His friend bought 2 decks at $7 each, costing $14. The total amount spent is $21 + $14 = $35.

The final answer is {The total amount they spent is $35.}.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",35,35.0,35.0

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve ! shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts before school. . If he had only ; washed : 29 of them ; by the time school , started, how ! many , did ; he not wash? ; 
                 **Understanding the problem:**
Sam needed to wash two types of shirts: short sleeve and long sleeve. He had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts. But he didn't finish washing all of them before school started. Instead, he only washed 29 shirts in total by the time school began. The question is, how many shirts did he not wash yet?

**Clarifying the variables:**
Let me define:
- Total short sleeve shirts needed: 40
- Total long sleeve shirts needed: 23
- Total shirts washed before school started: 29

**Identifying the unknowns:**
We need to find out how many shirts he didn't wash. That is, the total number of shirts he needed to wash minus the number he already washed.

**Calculating the number of short sleeve shirts washed:**
He needed 40 short sleeve shirts. Let's say he washed S short sleeve shirts. Then, the remaining short sleeve shirts he didn't wash would be 40 - S.

**Calculating the number of long sleeve shirts washed:**
Similarly, he needed 23 long sleeve shirts. Let's say he washed L long sleeve shirts. Then, the remaining long sleeve shirts he didn't wash would be 23 - L.

**Total shirts not washed:**
Since he didn't wash S and L shirts, the total number of shirts not washed would be (40 - S) + (23 - L).

But we also know that the total number of shirts he washed before school started is 29. So, S + L = 29.

**Setting up the equation:**
We have two equations:
1. S + L = 29
2. (40 - S) + (23 - L) = total shirts not washed

But the problem asks for the number of shirts not washed, so we need to express that in terms of known quantities.

**Expressing the total not washed:**
Total not washed = (40 - S) + (23 - L) = 63 - (S + L)

We already know that S + L = 29, so substituting that in:

Total not washed = 63 - 29 = 34

**Conclusion:**
Sam did not wash 34 shirts in total.
</think>

**Understanding the problem:**
Sam had to wash a total of 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts. However, by the time school started, he had only washed 29 shirts in total. We need to determine how many shirts he did not wash.

**Clarifying the variables:**
- **Total short sleeve shirts needed:** 40
- **Total long sleeve shirts needed:** 23
- **Total shirts washed before school started:** 29

**Identifying the unknowns:**
- **Short sleeve shirts washed (S):** Unknown
- **Long sleeve shirts washed (L):** Unknown

**Setting up the equations:**
1. **Total shirts washed:** \( S + L = 29 \)
2. **Total shirts not washed:** \( (40 - S) + (23 - L) \)

**Solving for the total shirts not washed:**
\[
\text{Total shirts not washed} = (40 - S) + (23 - L) = 63 - (S + L)
\]
Substituting the known value of \( S + L \):
\[
\text{Total shirts not washed} = 63 - 29 = 34
\]

**Final Answer:**
Sam did not wash \(\boxed{34}\) shirts.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",34,34.0,34.0

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
I need to determine how many customers the waiter would have after some changes.

First, the waiter initially has 47 customers waiting.

Then, 41 customers leave. To find out how many customers are left after this, I subtract 41 from 47.

47 minus 41 equals 6.

After that, the waiter receives 20 new customers. To find the total number of customers, I add the remaining 6 to the 20 new customers.

6 plus 20 equals 26.

Therefore, the waiter would have 26 customers in total.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of customers:**
   
   The waiter initially has **47** customers waiting.

2. **Customers leave:**
   
   **41** customers leave. 
   
   To find out how many customers are left after this:
   
   \[
   47 - 41 = 6
   \]
   
   So, **6** customers remain.

3. **New customers arrive:**
   
   The waiter gets **20** new customers.
   
   To find the total number of customers after the new ones arrive:
   
   \[
   6 + 20 = 26
   \]
   
4. **Final number of customers:**
   
   The waiter would have **26** customers in total.
