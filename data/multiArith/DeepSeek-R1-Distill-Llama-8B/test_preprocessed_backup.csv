                    question:
                     Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player? 
                 

</think>
Alright, so I've got this problem here about Paige and her mp3 player. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, the problem says she had 11 songs on her mp3 player. Then she deleted 9 old songs, and after that, she added 8 new songs. The question is, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player now?

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, she started with 11 songs. That's straightforward. Then she deleted 9 songs. So, I think I need to subtract those 9 songs from the original 11. Let me write that down: 11 minus 9. What's 11 minus 9? Well, 11 minus 9 is 2. So after deleting 9 songs, she's left with 2 songs.

Wait, but then she adds 8 new songs. So, after having 2 songs, she adds 8 more. That should be 2 plus 8, right? Let me calculate that: 2 plus 8 is 10. So, does that mean she ends up with 10 songs on her mp3 player?

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 11 songs, delete 9, that leaves her with 2. Then she adds 8, so 2 plus 8 is indeed 10. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think there's any tricky part here. It's just basic subtraction and addition. Sometimes, these problems can be a bit sneaky, but this one seems pretty straightforward. No need to overcomplicate it.

So, to recap: 11 minus 9 equals 2, and 2 plus 8 equals 10. Therefore, after deleting the old songs and adding the new ones, Paige has 10 songs on her mp3 player.
</think>

Paige started with 11 songs. After deleting 9, she has 2 left. Adding 8 new songs brings the total to 10.

{The final answer is 10 songs.}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",10
" There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut? 
                 

</think>
Alright, so I need to figure out how many students didn't make the cut for the basketball team. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that there are two groups trying out: 39 girls and 4 boys. So, the total number of students trying out is 39 plus 4. Let me add those together. 39 plus 4 equals 43. Okay, so there are 43 students in total.

Now, the problem says that 26 of them got called back. I need to find out how many didn't make the cut. To do this, I'll subtract the number of students who made it from the total number of students. So, 43 minus 26. Let me do that subtraction. 43 minus 26 is 17. 

Wait, let me double-check that. 26 plus 17 should equal 43. Let me add them: 26 plus 10 is 36, plus 7 more is 43. Yep, that checks out. So, 17 students didn't make the cut.

I think that's all there is to it. I didn't miss anything else in the problem, so I'm confident that 17 is the correct number of students who didn't make the basketball team.
</think>

To determine how many students didn't make the cut, we start by calculating the total number of students trying out and then subtract the number who were called back.

1. **Total number of students trying out**: 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students.
2. **Number of students who made the cut**: 26.
3. **Students who didn't make the cut**: 43 - 26 = 17.

**Answer**: 17 students didn't make the cut. {The final answer is}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",17

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Faye starts with 34 coloring books.**

- **Initial number of coloring books:** 34

**Step 2: Faye gives away 3 coloring books.**

- **Number of books given away:** 3
- **Remaining number of books after giving away 3:** 34 - 3 = 31

**Step 3: Faye buys 48 more coloring books.**

- **Number of new books bought:** 48
- **Total number of books after buying:** 31 + 48 = 79

**Final Answer:**

" The school cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch for the students and then bought 6 more, how many apples would they have? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     The school cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch for the students and then bought 6 more, how many apples would they have? 
                 {

</think>
Okay, let's see. The problem is about apples in the school cafeteria. So, they start with 23 apples. Then they used 20 to make lunch for the students. After that, they bought 6 more apples. The question is asking how many apples they would have in total after these actions.

First, I need to figure out how many apples they have after using 20 for lunch. If they started with 23 and used 20, I should subtract 20 from 23. Let me do that: 23 minus 20 equals 3. So, after using 20 apples, they have 3 left.

Next, they bought 6 more apples. So, I need to add those 6 apples to the remaining 3. That would be 3 plus 6, which equals 9. So, adding the 6 apples brings the total back up to 9.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 23, using 20 leaves 3. Then adding 6 gives 9. Yeah, that seems right.

I'm a bit confused though. Is the order of operations correct? They used 20 first, so subtracting that makes sense. Then, they bought more apples, so adding makes sense. Yeah, I think I did it right.

Another way to look at it is to add the 6 apples first. If they started with 23 and bought 6, that would be 29. Then they used 20, so 29 minus 20 is 9. Same result, so that checks out.

I think I'm confident now. The total number of apples they have after using 20 and then buying 6 is 9.
</think>

To determine the total number of apples the cafeteria has after using 20 apples and then buying 6 more, follow these steps:

1. **Start with the initial number of apples:**
   \[
   23 \text{ apples}
   \]

2. **Subtract the number of apples used for lunch:**
   \[
   23 \text{ apples} - 20 \text{ apples} = 3 \text{ apples remaining}
   \]

3. **Add the 6 new apples purchased:**
   \[
   3 \text{ apples} + 6 \text{ apples} = 9 \text{ apples total}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of apples the cafeteria has is **9**.

                    question:
                     Tom had 5 books. If he sold 4 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Tom have? 
                 {Think...}
Alright, let's try to figure out how many books Tom has after selling some and buying new ones. So, Tom starts with 5 books. Hmm, okay. He sells 4 of them. Wait, how much money does he get from selling 4 books? I guess the problem doesn't specify the price per book, but maybe I don't need that information. Maybe it's just about the number of books he has after the transactions.

Okay, so he sold 4 books. Let's say he gets some money from that. Then he uses that money to buy 38 new books. So, he's replacing the 4 he sold with 38 new ones. But wait, he started with 5 books. If he sold 4, he would have 1 left, right? Then he uses the money to buy 38 new books. So, he would have 1 plus 38 books. That would make it 39 books in total.

Wait, is that all? Let me double-check. Starting with 5 books, sells 4, so he's left with 1. He uses the money to buy 38, so adding that to the 1 he has. So 1 + 38 is 39. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I need to consider any other details like the price per book or anything else because the problem doesn't give that information, and it's only asking about the number of books.

Hmm, is there another way to look at it? Maybe subtracting the 4 he sold from his total and then adding the 38 he bought. So, 5 - 4 = 1, then 1 + 38 = 39. Yep, same result. I think that's the correct answer. He ends up with 39 books.
</think>

Tom initially has 5 books. He sells 4 of them, leaving him with 1 book. He then uses the proceeds from the sale to buy 38 new books. Therefore, the total number of books Tom has is:

5 (initial) - 4 (sold) + 38 (bought) = 39 books.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem:**
Emily was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 41 seeds and planted 29 of them in the big garden. In each of her small gardens, she put 4 seeds each. How many small gardens did Emily have?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Total Seeds:**
   - Emily started with a total of **41 seeds**.

2. **Seeds Planted in the Big Garden:**
   - She planted **29 seeds** in the big garden.
   - Remaining seeds after planting in the big garden:
     \[
     41 \text{ seeds} - 29 \text{ seeds} = 12 \text{ seeds}
     \]

3. **Seeds Planted in Small Gardens:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of small gardens.
   - Each small garden has **4 seeds**.
   - Total seeds planted in small gardens:
     \[
     4 \text{ seeds} \times x = 4x
     \]
   - According to the problem, the remaining seeds after planting in the big garden are used for the small gardens:
     \[
     4x = 12 \text{ seeds}
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - To find the number of small gardens, divide both sides of the equation by 4:

                 Okay, so Mike is helping put away books at the library. There are a total of 82 books. A librarian takes 10 of them, leaving Mike with the rest. Now, Mike can fit 9 books on a shelf. The question is, how many shelves will he need?

Hmm, let me break this down. First, Mike starts with 82 books. Then a librarian takes 10 away. So, how many books does Mike have left? I think I need to subtract 10 from 82.

Let me do that: 82 minus 10. 82 minus 10 is 72. So, Mike has 72 books left to put away.

Now, the next part is about how many shelves he needs. He can fit 9 books on each shelf. So, I guess I need to figure out how many times 9 goes into 72. That's essentially dividing 72 by 9.

Wait, let me make sure. So, 9 books per shelf. How many shelves? So, 72 divided by 9. Let me do that division. 9 goes into 72 eight times because 9 times 8 is 72. So, he would need 8 shelves.

But hold on, let me double-check my math. 9 times 8 is indeed 72. So, that seems right. So, the number of shelves is 8.

Alternatively, I can think of it as each shelf holding 9 books, so for 72 books, the number of shelves is 72 divided by 9, which is 8. Yeah, that makes sense.

I don't think there's any need to complicate this further. It's straightforward division. So, I think 8 is the correct number of shelves Mike will need.
</think>

Mike starts with 82 books. After the librarian takes 10, he has 72 left. Dividing 72 by 9 (the number of books per shelf) gives 8 shelves needed.

                    question:
                     A store had 40 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 25 of the old ones and put 21 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin? 
                 }
Okay, so I have this problem here about oranges in a bin. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the store starts with 40 oranges in the bin. Then they throw away 25 of the old ones. Hmm, I think that means they remove 25 oranges from the bin. After that, they put 21 new ones in. I need to find out how many oranges are left in the bin after these actions.

Let me break it down. First, they had 40 oranges. Then they threw away 25. So, how many oranges does that leave? I guess I subtract 25 from 40. Let me do that: 40 minus 25 equals 15. So, after throwing away 25, there are 15 oranges left.

But wait, then they put 21 new ones in. So, I need to add those 21 oranges to the remaining 15. Let me add them: 15 plus 21. Hmm, 15 plus 20 is 35, and then plus 1 more is 36. So, 36 oranges in total.

Wait, let me double-check. Starting with 40, subtract 25 gives 15. Then adding 21 gives 36. Yeah, that seems right. So, the total number of oranges in the bin should be 36.

I don't think I missed anything here. They removed the old ones and added new ones, so it's a straightforward subtraction and addition problem. Yep, 36 oranges in the bin.
</think>

The store initially has 40 oranges. They remove 25 old oranges, leaving 15. Then they add 21 new oranges, resulting in a total of 36.

                 {
</think>
Okay, so I have this problem about a pet shelter with puppies. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the shelter initially has 5 puppies. Then, they bring in another 35 puppies. So, I need to figure out the total number of puppies they have after these new ones are added. Let me write that down.

Total puppies = Initial puppies + New puppies
Total puppies = 5 + 35
Total puppies = 40

Alright, so there are 40 puppies in total now. The next part says that 8 puppies a day are adopted. The question is asking how long it would take for all of them to be adopted. Hmm, okay, so I need to find out the time required to adopt all 40 puppies at a rate of 8 per day.

I think this is a division problem where I divide the total number of puppies by the adoption rate. Let me do that.

Time = Total puppies / Adoptions per day
Time = 40 / 8
Time = 5 days

Wait, does that make sense? If 8 puppies are adopted each day, then in 5 days, 8 * 5 = 40 puppies would be adopted. That matches the total number we have. So, it should take 5 days to adopt all the puppies.

I don't see any complications here. There's no mention of any puppies being returned or not adopted, so I think it's a straightforward division problem. So, yeah, I think 5 days is the correct answer.
</think>

To determine how long it will take to adopt all the puppies, we first calculate the total number of puppies and then divide by the adoption rate.

1. **Total number of puppies:**
   - Initial puppies: 5
   - Additional puppies: 35
   - Total = 5 + 35 = 40

2. **Adoption rate per day:**
   - 8 puppies adopted each day

3. **Time required to adopt all puppies:**
   - Time = Total puppies / Adoptions per day
   - Time = 40 / 8 = 5 days

First, Frank won 33 tickets from 'whack a mole' and 9 tickets from 'skee ball'. So, the total number of tickets he has is 33 plus 9. Let me do that addition: 33 plus 9 is... um, 42. So, he has 42 tickets in total.

Now, the candy he wants to buy costs 6 tickets each. That means for each candy, he needs to spend 6 tickets. I need to find out how many candies he can buy with 42 tickets.

To find that, I should divide the total number of tickets by the cost per candy. So, that would be 42 divided by 6. Let me calculate that. 42 divided by 6 is 7. So, he can buy 7 candies.

Wait, let me double-check. If each candy costs 6 tickets, then 7 candies would cost 7 times 6 tickets, which is 42. Yes, that matches the number of tickets he has. So, he can exactly buy 7 candies without any leftover tickets.

I don't think there's any trick or anything here. It's just a simple division problem. So, yeah, 7 candies is the answer.

</think>
Alright, let's try to figure out how many customers left a tip at The Greasy Spoon. Hmm, okay, so the waiter started with 26 customers. Then during lunch rush, he had 27 more come in. So first, I should add those together to find out the total number of customers he waited on.

26 plus 27... let me do that math. 26 plus 20 is 46, and then plus 7 more is 53. So, he had a total of 53 customers. That makes sense because 26 plus 27 equals 53. Okay, got that part down.

Now, the problem says that 27 of the customers didn't leave a tip. Hmm, so that means out of all the customers, 27 didn't tip. I need to find out how many did leave a tip. Well, if there are 53 customers in total and 27 didn't tip, then the number of customers who did tip would be the total minus those who didn't tip.

So, 53 minus 27. Let me calculate that. 53 minus 20 is 33, and then minus 7 more is 26. So, 26 customers left a tip. That seems straightforward.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If he had 26 to start with and added 27 more, that's 53 customers. Out of these 53, 27 didn't tip, so subtracting 27 from 53 gives 26 who did tip. Yeah, that adds up.

I don't think there's anything tricky here. It's just a matter of adding and subtracting. No need to overcomplicate it. So, the answer should be 26 customers who left a tip.
</think>

To determine how many customers left a tip, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of customers:**
   - Start with 26 customers.
   - Add 27 more customers during lunch rush.
   - Total customers = 26 + 27 = 53.

2. **Determine the number of customers who didn't leave a tip:**
   - 27 customers didn't leave a tip.

3. **Find out how many customers left a tip:**
   - Subtract the number of customers who didn't tip from the total number of customers.
   - Customers who left a tip = 53 - 27 = 26.

**Final Answer:** 26 customers did leave a tip. {The final answer is 26}.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",26

                    question:
                     A toy store had 17 giant stuffed bears in stock when they got another shipment with 10 bears in it. The put the bears onto shelves with 9 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? 
                 <think>
First, I need to determine the total number of giant stuffed bears the toy store has after receiving the new shipment.

The store initially has 17 bears in stock, and they receive an additional 10 bears from the shipment. By adding these together, the total number of bears becomes 17 plus 10, which equals 27 bears.

Next, I need to figure out how many shelves are required to display these 27 bears, with 9 bears on each shelf.

To do this, I will divide the total number of bears by the number of bears each shelf can hold. So, 27 divided by 9 equals 3. This means that 3 shelves are needed to display all the bears.

Therefore, the toy store will use 3 shelves to display the giant stuffed bears.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of bears:**
   
   - **Initial stock:** 17 bears
   - **New shipment:** 10 bears
   - **Total bears = 17 + 10 = 27 bears**

2. **Determine the number of shelves needed:**
   
   - **Bears per shelf:** 9
   - **Number of shelves = Total bears ÷ Bears per shelf = 27 ÷ 9 = 3 shelves**

**Final Answer:**

They used \boxed{3} shelves. {The final answer is}.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",3

" Wendy picked 103 flowers for her friend’s wedding. She was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. If 47 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>

                    question:
                     Wendy picked 103 flowers for her friend’s wedding. She was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. If 47 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make? 
                 Okay, so Wendy has 103 flowers that she picked for her friend's wedding. She was planning to make bouquets, each containing 8 flowers. But then, 47 of those flowers wilted before the wedding. Hmm, I need to figure out how many bouquets she can still make with the remaining flowers.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I should find out how many flowers are left after the wilted ones. So, she started with 103 flowers, and 47 of them wilted. To find the number of flowers that didn't wilt, I subtract the wilted ones from the total. That would be 103 minus 47. Let me do that subtraction: 103 minus 40 is 63, and then minus 7 more is 56. So, she has 56 flowers that didn't wilt.

Now, each bouquet requires 8 flowers. I need to figure out how many bouquets she can make with 56 flowers. To do this, I should divide the number of remaining flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet. That would be 56 divided by 8. Hmm, 8 times 7 is 56, right? So, 56 divided by 8 is exactly 7. That means she can make 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers.

Wait a second, let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with 103 flowers, subtract 47 wilted ones: 103 - 47. 103 minus 40 is 63, and then 63 minus 7 is 56. Yep, that's correct. Then, 56 divided by 8 is 7. That seems right. So, she can make 7 bouquets.

I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm. Maybe think about how many bouquets she could have made originally and then subtract the ones affected by the wilted flowers. Let's see, 103 divided by 8 is... 8 times 12 is 96, which leaves 7 flowers. So, she could have made 12 full bouquets and had 7 flowers left over. But since 47 flowers wilted, which is more than 7, that affects the total number of bouquets she can make.

Wait, maybe that's complicating things. It's probably better to just focus on the remaining flowers after the wilt. So, she has 56 flowers, each bouquet uses 8, so 56 divided by 8 is 7. Yeah, that's straightforward.

Alternatively, I can think about how many flowers are needed for each additional bouquet. Each bouquet needs 8, so starting from 0, adding 8 each time. 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56. So that's 7 bouquets, each requiring 8 flowers, to get to 56. That matches my earlier calculation.

I guess another way to verify is to multiply the number of bouquets by 8 and see if it equals the remaining flowers. 7 bouquets times 8 flowers each is 56 flowers. Yep, that's exactly how many she has left. So, that checks out.

Is there any possibility that she could make more bouquets if she used fewer flowers in each bouquet? But the problem states that each bouquet has 8 flowers, so she can't change that. So, she has to make bouquets with exactly 8 flowers each. Therefore, 7 bouquets is the maximum number she can make.

So, putting it all together, Wendy started with 103 flowers, 47 wilted, leaving her with 56. Divided by 8 flowers per bouquet gives 7. So, she can make 7 bouquets.
</think>

Wendy has 103 flowers and 47 wilt. Subtracting the wilted flowers gives 56 remaining. Dividing 56 by 8 flowers per bouquet yields 7 bouquets.

                     - **Initial Books:** 48
                     - **Books Sold:** 19
                     - **Books Bought:** 38

                  3. **Calculating Profit:**
                     - **Profit per Book:** Since it's not specified, we can assume he sells each book at the same price. Let's denote the selling price per book as ""x"".
                     - **Total Profit:** 19x
                     - **Cost of New Books:** 38x

                  4. **Determining the Net Change:**
                     - **Books After Selling:** 48 - 19 = 29
                     - **Books After Buying:** 29 + 38 = 67
                     - **Profit in Books:** Since he used the profit to buy new books, the 38 books are effectively added to his collection. The exact profit in terms of books isn't directly needed because the problem is about the total number of books.

                  5. **Conclusion:**
                     - Adam starts with 48, sells 19, buys 38, resulting in 48 - 19 + 38 = 67 books.
</think>

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many books Adam has after his transactions.

1. **Initial Number of Books:**
   - Adam starts with **48 books**.

2. **Books Sold:**
   - Adam sells **19 books**.
   - **Books Remaining After Selling:**  
     \( 48 - 19 = 29 \) books.

3. **Books Purchased:**
   - Adam uses the money from selling 19 books to buy **38 new books**.
   - **Total Books After Purchase:**  
     \( 29 + 38 = 67 \) books.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Adam's total number of books after selling and purchasing is **67**.

" Nancy's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 5 people and there are 12 students and 3 adults going, how many vans will they need? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Nancy's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 5 people and there are 12 students and 3 adults going, how many vans will they need? 
                 }
Okay, so I've got this problem here about Nancy's class going on a field trip to the zoo. The question is asking how many vans they'll need. Each van can hold 5 people, and there are 12 students and 3 adults going. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out the total number of people going on the trip. There are 12 students and 3 adults. So, I should add those together. Let me do that: 12 plus 3. Hmm, that equals 15. Okay, so there are 15 people in total.

Now, each van can hold 5 people. I guess I need to find out how many groups of 5 people there are in the total number of people. So, I should divide the total number of people by the number each van can hold. That would be 15 divided by 5. Let me calculate that: 15 ÷ 5 is 3. So, that suggests they need 3 vans.

Wait a second, let me double-check. If each van holds 5 people, then one van can take 5 people. So, three vans would hold 15 people, which is exactly the number we have. That makes sense because there are no extra people beyond 15. So, 3 vans should be enough.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe by considering each group separately. There are 12 students and 3 adults, making 15 people. If each van can take 5, then we can see how many vans each group needs and then add them up. But wait, the students and adults can all go together in the same van, right? So, it's not like they need separate vans for students and adults. So, it's just one group of 15 people.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about how many students per van and how many adults per van. But since they're all going together, it doesn't matter. Each van can take up to 5 people, regardless of whether they're students or adults. So, whether it's 5 students, 5 adults, or a mix, each van can carry 5 people.

So, adding it all up, 15 people divided by 5 per van equals 3 vans. That seems right. I don't think there's any need to round up because 3 times 5 is exactly 15, so there are no leftover people. So, 3 vans should be sufficient.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in these problems, they might consider if there's an extra person or not, and you have to round up. But in this case, since 15 is perfectly divisible by 5, there's no extra needed. So, 3 is the exact number. I think that's correct.

Let me just visualize it. If each van is like a big box that can hold 5 people. So, first van takes 5, second takes another 5, third takes the last 5. That's 3 vans, each with exactly 5 people. Perfect fit, no one left behind. Yeah, that makes sense.

I don't see any other way to approach this. It's straightforward division. Total people divided by capacity per van gives the number of vans needed. So, 15 ÷ 5 = 3. That's the answer.
</think>

Nancy's class has 15 people going to the zoo (12 students + 3 adults). Each van can hold 5 people. Dividing the total number of people by the capacity per van gives 15 ÷ 5 = 3. Therefore, they need 3 vans.

" For a birthday party Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 7 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     For a birthday party Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 7 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up? 
                 I need to figure out how many shelves Tom will fill up with his sodas. He has 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas, making a total of 56 sodas. Each shelf can hold 7 sodas. So, I need to divide the total number of sodas by the number each shelf can hold to find out how many shelves he needs. 

Hmm, wait a minute. But the problem says he bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. Are regular and diet sodas different? If they are different, does that mean he needs separate shelves for each type? Or can he mix regular and diet on the same shelf? The problem doesn't specify any restrictions on that, so maybe he can mix them. 

If I go with the initial thought of just dividing 56 by 7, that would be 8 shelves. But if he needs separate shelves for regular and diet, then he would have 1 shelf for regular (since there are only 4) and 8 shelves for diet (since 52 divided by 7 is approximately 7.428, which would round up to 8). So in that case, he would need 9 shelves total. 

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about different types needing separate shelves. It just asks how many shelves he would fill up. Maybe the type doesn't matter; it's just the total number. So, 56 divided by 7 is 8 shelves. That seems straightforward. 

But to make sure, let me check if the types matter. The problem says 4 regular and 52 diet, so maybe they are different. But unless specified, I think it's safe to assume he can mix them. 

Alternatively, maybe the fridge has a specific arrangement where it's 7 per shelf, regardless of type. So, whether they're regular or diet, each shelf holds 7. Therefore, regardless of the types, he needs 8 shelves. 

But then again, if he has only 4 regular, that's less than a shelf, so he could potentially combine them with diet on the same shelf. So, 4 regular and 52 diet, total 56, divided by 7 per shelf is 8. So, 8 shelves. 

Wait, but 52 divided by 7 is 7.428, which is 7 and 3/7, so he would need 8 shelves for diet alone, right? And 4 regular can fit on one shelf since 4 is less than 7. So, in that case, he would have 1 shelf for regular and 8 for diet, totaling 9 shelves. 

Hmm, this is conflicting. The problem is a bit ambiguous. It depends on whether the types are considered or not. 

Looking back at the problem: ""how many shelves would he fill up?"" It doesn't specify whether the types matter. So, maybe it's just the total number of sodas. So, 56 divided by 7 is 8 shelves. 

But, if the fridge can hold 7 on each shelf, regardless of type, then it's 8 shelves. If the types need separate shelves, then it's 9. Since the problem doesn't specify that, I think it's safer to assume that they can be mixed. 

Alternatively, maybe the fridge is arranged such that it's 7 per shelf, but the types have to be separate. But again, the problem doesn't say that. 

I think the answer is 8 shelves because the problem doesn't specify that different types need separate shelves, so we can assume they can be mixed. Therefore, 56 divided by 7 is 8.

Tom needs to fill up 8 shelves with his sodas.

                 {The final answer is}
</think>

To determine the total number of apples the school cafeteria has after using 20 apples for lunch and purchasing 28 additional apples, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Apples in the Cafeteria:**
   - The cafeteria starts with **38 apples**.

2. **Apples Used for Lunch:**
   - **20 apples** are used to make lunch for the students.

3. **Apples Purchased After Using:**
   - After using 20 apples, the cafeteria buys **28 more apples**.

4. **Calculating the Remaining Apples:**
   - Subtract the apples used from the initial amount:
     \[
     38 \text{ apples} - 20 \text{ apples} = 18 \text{ apples}
     \]
   - Add the apples purchased to the remaining apples:
     \[

" Luke was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 4 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another, how many trips will he make? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>

                    question:
                     Luke was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 4 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another, how many trips will he make? 
                 }
Okay, so Luke is helping with the lunch trays, right? He can carry 4 trays at a time. There are two tables he needs to pick up from: one with 20 trays and another with 16 trays. I need to figure out how many trips he'll have to make in total.

Hmm, let me break it down. First, he has to go to the first table with 20 trays. Since he can carry 4 at a time, I should figure out how many trips that takes. So, 20 divided by 4 is 5. That means he'll make 5 trips to the first table.

Now, onto the second table with 16 trays. Again, he can carry 4 trays each trip. So, 16 divided by 4 is 4. That means he'll need 4 trips to the second table.

Wait, but does he have to go back and forth between the tables? Like, does he go from the first table to the second, or is he making separate trips? The problem doesn't specify, so I think he just needs to go to each table separately. So, the trips are for each table, not combined.

So, adding those up, 5 trips to the first table and 4 trips to the second table, that's a total of 9 trips.

But let me double-check. If he goes to the first table, does he need to come back? Or is he just making one-way trips? Since the problem says he's picking up trays from each table, I think each trip is a one-way trip to each table. So, for each table, he makes as many trips as needed to carry all the trays, without considering the return trips because he's just dropping them off or taking them somewhere else.

So, yeah, 5 trips for 20 trays and 4 trips for 16 trays. 5 plus 4 equals 9. That makes sense.
</think>

Luke needs to make 5 trips to the first table and 4 trips to the second table, totaling 9 trips.

                 {
</think>
Alright, so Tiffany has this problem where she baked 8 brownies, but she needs 17 in total for her party. She used 8 cups of flour on each one, and the question is asking how much more flour she needs. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out how much flour Tiffany has already used. She used 8 cups per brownie, and she made 8 brownies. So, to get the total flour used, I should multiply the number of brownies by the cups of flour per brownie. That makes sense because each brownie uses the same amount.

So, 8 cups per brownie times 8 brownies equals... let me do the math. 8 times 8 is 64. So, she has used 64 cups of flour so far.

Now, she needs a total of 17 brownies. She's already baked 8, so she needs 17 minus 8 more brownies. Let me subtract that: 17 minus 8 is 9. So, she needs to make 9 more brownies.

Each of those 9 brownies will require 8 cups of flour, right? So, to find out how much more flour she needs, I multiply the number of additional brownies by the cups of flour per brownie. That's 9 times 8.

Calculating that, 9 times 8 is 72. So, she needs 72 cups of flour for the remaining brownies.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. She made 8 brownies with 8 cups each, totaling 64 cups. She needs 17, so 17 minus 8 is 9 more brownies. Each of those requires 8 cups, so 9 times 8 is indeed 72. Yeah, that seems right.

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by calculating the total flour needed for 17 brownies first and then subtracting what she already used. Let's try that method to confirm.

So, 17 brownies times 8 cups each would be 17 times 8. Let me calculate that: 17 times 8 is 136. So, she needs 136 cups of flour in total.

She already used 64 cups, so subtracting that from the total needed: 136 minus 64 is 72. Yep, same result. That confirms it.

I think I've got it right. She needs 72 more cups of flour.

Tiffany baked 8 brownies using 8 cups of flour each, totaling 64 cups. She needs 17 brownies, so she requires 9 more, each needing 8 cups. Therefore, she needs 72 cups more.

                 Okay, so Carol and her mom are picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked 29, and her mom picked 16. But only 38 of the carrots were good. The question is asking how many bad carrots they had. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, let me figure out how many carrots they picked in total. Carol picked 29, and her mom picked 16. So adding those together, 29 plus 16 equals 45. So altogether, they picked 45 carrots.

Now, out of these 45 carrots, only 38 were good. That means the rest must be bad, right? So to find the number of bad carrots, I can subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots they picked.

So, 45 total carrots minus 38 good carrots equals... let me do the subtraction. 45 minus 38 is 7. So, that would mean there are 7 bad carrots.

Wait a minute, let me double-check that. Sometimes when I do subtraction, I might make a mistake. So, 38 plus 7 is 45, which matches the total they picked. Yep, that makes sense. So, the bad carrots are 7 in total.

                    question:
                     A worksheet had 7 problems on it. If a teacher had 17 worksheets to grade and had already graded 8 of them, how many more problems does she have to grade? 
                 {The final answer is}
</think>
First, I recognize that there are a total of 17 worksheets that need to be graded.

The teacher has already graded 8 of these worksheets.

To find out how many more worksheets need to be graded, I subtract the number of graded worksheets from the total number of worksheets.

17 total worksheets minus 8 graded worksheets equals 9 remaining worksheets.

Therefore, the teacher has 9 more problems to grade.
</think>

**Solution:**

To determine how many more problems the teacher has to grade, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of worksheets to grade:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total worksheets} = 17
   \]

2. **Determine how many worksheets have already been graded:**
   
   \[
   \text{Graded worksheets} = 8
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ungraded worksheets:**
   
   \[
   \text{Ungraded worksheets} = \text{Total worksheets} - \text{Graded worksheets}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Ungraded worksheets} = 17 - 8 = 9
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   
   The teacher has to grade \(\boxed{9}\) more problems.

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
To determine the total cost for the group of 11 people, I'll start by identifying the number of adults and children.

There are 2 kids in the group, so the number of adults is 11 minus 2, which equals 9 adults.

Each adult meal costs $8. Therefore, the cost for the adult meals is 9 adults multiplied by $8 per meal, totaling $72.

Kids eat free, so there are no additional costs for the 2 children.

Adding the cost of the adult meals to the cost of the children's meals, the total cost for the group is $72 plus $0, which equals $72.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the number of adults and kids in the group.**
   
   - **Total people:** 11
   - **Kids:** 2
   - **Adults:** 11 - 2 = **9**

2. **Calculate the cost for the adult meals.**
   
   - **Cost per adult meal:** \$8
   - **Total cost for adults:** 9 adults × \$8/adult = **\$72**

3. **Calculate the cost for the kids' meals.**
   
   - **Kids eat free:** 2 kids × \$0 = **\$0**

4. **Determine the total cost for the group.**
   
   - **Total cost:** \$72 (adults) + \$0 (kids) = **\$72**

                 Okay, so Frank made $19 mowing lawns. Then he spent $11 on new mower blades. I need to figure out how much money he has left after that. Then, see how many 2-dollar games he can buy with the remaining amount. 

First, subtract the amount he spent from the total he earned. So, $19 minus $11. Let me do that calculation: 19 minus 11 equals 8. So, Frank has $8 left.

Now, each game costs $2. To find out how many games he can buy, I'll divide the remaining money by the cost per game. That's $8 divided by $2. 

Hmm, 8 divided by 2 is 4. So, Frank can buy 4 games.

Wait, let me double-check my math to be sure. 19 minus 11 is definitely 8, and 8 divided by 2 is 4. Yeah, that seems right.
</think>

Frank earned a total of **\$19** from mowing lawns. He spent **\$11** on new mower blades. To find out how much money he has left, subtract the amount he spent from the total he earned:

\[
19 - 11 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, to determine how many **2**-dollar games he can buy with the remaining **\$8**, divide the amount of money he has left by the cost per game:

\[
8 \div 2 = 4
\]

Therefore, Frank can buy **4** 2-dollar games with his remaining money.

Okay, let's try to figure out how many pictures were in each album. So, Isabel uploaded 25 pictures to Facebook. She put 10 pictures into one album and the rest into 5 different albums. Hmm, I need to find out how many pictures are in each of those 5 different albums.

First, she has one album with 10 pictures. That part is clear. Now, the remaining pictures are in 5 different albums. So, to find out how many pictures are in each of those 5 albums, I think I should subtract the 10 pictures from the total 25.

Let me write that down: 25 total pictures minus 10 pictures in the first album equals... 15 pictures left. So, those 15 pictures are spread out over 5 different albums. Now, to find out how many are in each of those 5 albums, I should divide the remaining pictures by the number of albums.

So, 15 pictures divided by 5 albums. Let me do that calculation: 15 ÷ 5 = 3. That means each of the 5 different albums has 3 pictures.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, one album has 10, and each of the other 5 has 3. So, 10 plus (5 times 3) should equal 25. Let's see: 10 + (5×3) = 10 + 15 = 25. Yep, that adds up. So, each of the 5 different albums has 3 pictures each.

I think that's the correct answer. Each of the 5 albums has 3 pictures.
</think>

Isabel uploaded a total of 25 pictures to Facebook. She created one album with 10 pictures and distributed the remaining 15 pictures across 5 different albums. 

To determine how many pictures are in each of the 5 albums:
- Subtract the 10 pictures from the total: 25 - 10 = 15 pictures left.
- Divide the remaining pictures by the number of albums: 15 ÷ 5 = 3 pictures per album.

Thus, each of the 5 different albums contains 3 pictures.

To determine how long Mike's money will last, I'll start by calculating the total amount of money he has.

Mike earned $14 from mowing lawns and $26 from weed eating, so his total earnings are $14 + $26 = $40.

He spends $5 each week. To find out how many weeks his money will last, I'll divide the total amount of money by his weekly spending.

$40 divided by $5 equals 8 weeks.

Therefore, Mike's money will last him for 8 weeks.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Total Earnings:**
   
   Mike earned money from two activities:
   
   - **Mowing Lawns:** \$14
   - **Weed Eating:** \$26
   
   **Total Earnings = \$14 + \$26 = \$40**

2. **Calculate Weekly Spending:**
   
   Mike spends \$5 each week.

3. **Determine How Long the Money Will Last:**
   
   To find out how many weeks the money will last, divide the total earnings by the weekly spending.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Weekly Spending}} = \frac{\$40}{\$5} = 8 \text{ weeks}
   \]

                 }
</think>
To solve the problem, I first determine how many pieces of clothing Will has left after the initial load. He started with 59 pieces and used 32 in the first load, so he has 27 pieces remaining.

Next, I need to divide these remaining 27 pieces into 9 equal loads. To find out how many pieces go into each small load, I divide the total number of remaining pieces by the number of loads.

Finally, I calculate the number by performing the division: 27 divided by 9, which equals 3. Therefore, each of the small loads can contain 3 pieces of clothing.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Pieces of Clothing:**  
   Will has a total of **59** pieces of clothing to wash.

2. **First Load:**  
   He puts **32** pieces of clothing in the first load.

3. **Remaining Pieces After First Load:**  
   To find out how many pieces are left to be washed, subtract the first load from the total:
   
   \[
   59 \text{ (total)} - 32 \text{ (first load)} = 27 \text{ (remaining)}
   \]

4. **Number of Small Loads:**  
   Will decides to split the remaining **27** pieces into **9** equal loads.

5. **Clothing per Small Load:**  
   To find out how many pieces go into each small load, divide the remaining pieces by the number of small loads:
   
   \[
   \frac{27 \text{ (remaining)}}{9 \text{ (small loads)}} = 3
   \]

6. **Final Answer:**  
   Each small load can contain **3** pieces of clothing.

                    question:
                     April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was 6 dollars. If Katie bought 5 roses and 5 daisies, how much did she spend? 
                


</think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here about April's discount flowers. They're having a sale where each flower is $6. Katie bought 5 roses and 5 daisies. I need to figure out how much she spent. Alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should probably identify what the problem is asking. It wants to know the total amount Katie spent on buying roses and daisies. Each flower costs $6, so I guess I need to find the cost for each type of flower and then add them up.

Wait, the problem mentions that each flower is $6. Does that mean each rose is $6 and each daisy is also $6? That makes sense because it's a sale where each flower is on discount. So whether it's a rose or a daisy, each one individually costs $6. So, I don't have to worry about different prices for roses and daisies.

Now, Katie bought 5 roses and 5 daisies. So, I need to calculate the total cost for the roses and the total cost for the daisies separately and then add them together to get the total amount she spent.

Let me write that down:

Total cost = Cost of roses + Cost of daisies

Since each rose is $6, and she bought 5, the cost for roses would be 5 multiplied by $6. Similarly, each daisy is also $6, so the cost for daisies would be 5 multiplied by $6 as well.

So, mathematically, that would be:

Cost of roses = 5 * $6
Cost of daisies = 5 * $6

Then, total cost = (5 * $6) + (5 * $6)

Let me calculate each part.

First, 5 times 6 is... let me see, 5 times 6 is 30. So, each set of 5 flowers (whether roses or daisies) costs $30.

Since she bought 5 roses and 5 daisies, that's two sets of 5 flowers. So, I can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the roses and the cost of the daisies.

So, total cost = $30 (roses) + $30 (daisies) = $60.

Wait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe I can combine the two purchases into one calculation since each flower is the same price.

She bought a total of 5 roses + 5 daisies = 10 flowers. Each flower is $6, so total cost would be 10 * $6 = $60.

Oh, that's another way to look at it, and it gives the same answer. So, whether I calculate each type separately or combine them, the total comes out to $60.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 5 roses at $6 each: 5 * 6 = 30. 5 daisies at $6 each: 5 * 6 = 30. Adding them together: 30 + 30 = 60. Yep, that's correct.

Alternatively, 10 flowers at $6 each: 10 * 6 = 60. Same result.

I think that's solid. So, Katie spent $60 in total.
</think>

Katie bought 5 roses and 5 daisies, each costing $6. 

Calculating the cost:
- Cost of roses = 5 * $6 = $30
- Cost of daisies = 5 * $6 = $30

Total cost = $30 + $30 = $60.

Alternatively, total flowers = 10, so cost = 10 * $6 = $60.

{The final answer is $60.}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",60

                    question:
                     At the schools book fair Victor bought 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books. If 16 of the books were used, how many new books did he buy? 
                 {Think...}
Okay, so Victor bought some books at the school book fair. He bought 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books. Then, he used 16 of them. The question is asking how many new books he bought. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand what's given. He bought two types of books: adventure and mystery. The numbers are 32 and 37 respectively. So, in total, how many books did he buy before any were used? Let me add those two numbers together. 32 plus 37 is... let's see, 30 plus 30 is 60, and 2 plus 7 is 9, so 60 plus 9 is 69. So, he bought a total of 69 books.

Now, out of these 69 books, he used 16. Wait, does ""used"" mean he read them and doesn't want to read them again, so he's done with them? Or does it mean he's using them for something else, like giving them to a friend or donating them? The problem isn't entirely clear, but I think in the context of a book fair purchase, using a book might mean he's finished reading it and doesn't need it anymore. So, he probably wants to know how many new books he needs to buy, considering he already used 16.

But wait, maybe ""used"" here refers to using them for another purpose, like as part of a class project or something. Hmm, but the question is about how many new books he bought, so perhaps he's keeping some and wants to replace the ones he used. So, he bought 69 books and used 16, so he might have some left. But actually, the question is how many new books he bought, so maybe he's buying more to add to his collection beyond the 69 he already has?

Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Let me read the question again: ""If 16 of the books were used, how many new books did he buy?"" Hmm. Maybe he bought some new books on top of the ones he already bought. But the initial purchase was 32 adventure and 37 mystery, so 69 total. Then, he used 16, so he might have some left, but he bought new ones. Wait, the wording is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the 16 used books are part of the total he bought, so he's left with some, and he bought more. Wait, but the question is about how many new books he bought, not how many he has left. So maybe he bought some books, used 16, and then bought more new ones. But the problem says he bought 32 and 37, so maybe those are the ones he initially bought, and then he bought more on top of that, but then he used 16. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that he went to the book fair and bought some books, then used 16 of them, and now he wants to know how many new books he bought in addition to those 16. But I'm not sure. Let me try to parse the problem again.

""At the schools book fair Victor bought 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books. If 16 of the books were used, how many new books did he buy?""

So, he bought 32 + 37 = 69 books. Then, he used 16 of them. The question is, how many new books did he buy? Wait, did he buy new books in addition to the 69, or is the 16 used part of the 69?

I think the 16 used books are part of the 69 he bought. So, he has 69 books, used 16, so he has 69 - 16 = 53 books left. But the question is how many new books he bought. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe he bought some books, then used 16, and then bought more. But the problem says he bought 32 and 37, so that's his initial purchase. So, perhaps he used 16 of those, and then bought more. But the problem doesn't mention buying more, only that he bought 32 and 37. So, maybe the 16 used books are from those 69, and he wants to know how many new ones he bought beyond that. But the problem doesn't mention buying more, so maybe the answer is zero? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that he bought some books, used 16, and then bought new ones. But the problem says he bought 32 and 37, so maybe those are the ones he initially bought, and then he used 16, so he needs to buy more to replace them. But the question is how many new books he bought, so perhaps he bought 32 and 37, used 16, and then bought more to replace them, but the problem doesn't specify that he bought more. So, maybe the answer is that he didn't buy any new books because he only bought 69 and used 16, so he still has 53 left. But the question is about new books, so maybe he bought some new ones in addition to the 69.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem says he bought 32 adventure and 37 mystery, so 69 total. Then, 16 were used. So, he has 69 - 16 = 53 books left. The question is how many new books he bought. Wait, but he only bought 69, so maybe he didn't buy any new ones beyond that. Alternatively, maybe the 16 used books are part of the ones he bought, and he wants to buy new ones to replace them. But the problem doesn't specify that he wants to replace them, just that he used 16.

Alternatively, perhaps the 16 used books are from the ones he bought, and he wants to know how many new ones he needs to buy to replenish his collection. But the problem doesn't specify that he wants to replenish, just that he bought some books and used 16. So, maybe the answer is that he bought 32 and 37, used 16, and then bought more, but the problem doesn't give the number of additional books he bought, so maybe the answer is zero.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that he bought some books, used 16, and then bought new ones, but the problem only mentions the initial purchase. So, maybe the answer is that he didn't buy any new books beyond the 69 he already bought. But the question is how many new books he bought, so maybe the answer is zero.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it as he bought 32 and 37, so 69 total. Then, he used 16, so he has 53 left. The question is how many new books he bought. But he only bought 69, so unless he bought more, the answer is zero. But maybe the 16 used books are part of the ones he bought, and he wants to buy new ones to add to his collection beyond what he has. But the problem doesn't specify that he bought more, only that he bought 32 and 37.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that he bought 32 and 37, then used 16, and then bought new ones, but the problem doesn't mention buying more. So, maybe the answer is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking how many new books he bought in addition to the 16 used. But that doesn't make sense because he bought 32 and 37, which is 69, and used 16, so he has 53 left. But the question is about new books, not the ones he has left.

Wait, maybe the problem is that he bought some books, then used 16, and then bought new ones, but the problem only mentions the initial purchase. So, perhaps the answer is that he didn't buy any new books beyond the 69 he already bought.

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is: Victor bought 32 adventure and 37 mystery books, so total 69. He used 16 of them. The question is, how many new books did he buy?

Wait, perhaps the 16 used books are part of the 69 he bought, and he wants to know how many new ones he bought in addition to those. But the problem doesn't mention buying more, so perhaps he bought zero new books beyond the 69.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that he bought some books, used 16, and then bought new ones, but the problem only mentions the initial purchase, so perhaps he bought zero new books beyond the 32 and 37.

Wait, but the problem says he bought 32 and 37, so that's his initial purchase. Then, he used 16, so he has 53 left. The question is how many new books he bought, so if he didn't buy any more, the answer is zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that he bought 32 and 37, then used 16, so he needs to buy new ones to replace them. But the problem doesn't specify that he did that, so perhaps the answer is zero.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is that he bought 32 and 37, so 69 total. Then, he used 16. The question is how",53

 Will was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 8 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 8 hours and on Tuesday he worked 2 hours. How much money did Will make in those two days? ,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Will was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 8 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 8 hours and on Tuesday he worked 2 hours. How much money did Will make in those two days? 
                 Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, Will works two days: Monday and Tuesday. He gets paid $8 per hour. On Monday, he worked 8 hours, and on Tuesday, he worked 2 hours. I need to find out how much money he made in total for both days.

First, I should probably calculate how much he earned each day separately and then add them together. That makes sense because his earnings are based on his hours worked each day.

Starting with Monday: He worked 8 hours at $8 per hour. So, I can multiply 8 hours by $8 to get his Monday earnings. Let me do that: 8 * 8. Hmm, 8 times 8 is 64. So, he made $64 on Monday.

Now, moving on to Tuesday: He worked 2 hours at the same rate of $8 per hour. To find out how much he earned that day, I'll multiply 2 hours by $8. That's 2 * 8, which equals 16. So, he made $16 on Tuesday.

To find the total amount he earned over the two days, I'll add his earnings from Monday and Tuesday together. That would be $64 + $16. Let me add those: 64 plus 16 is 80. So, adding them together gives a total of $80.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. On Monday, 8 hours times 8 dollars is definitely 64. And on Tuesday, 2 hours times 8 is 16. Adding 64 and 16 gives 80. Yeah, that seems right. So, Will made a total of $80 over the two days.
</think>

To determine how much money Will made in two days, we'll calculate his earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate Monday's earnings.**
- **Hours worked on Monday:** 8 hours
- **Pay rate:** $8 per hour
- **Earnings on Monday:** 8 hours × $8/hour = $64

**Step 2: Calculate Tuesday's earnings.**
- **Hours worked on Tuesday:** 2 hours
- **Pay rate:** $8 per hour
- **Earnings on Tuesday:** 2 hours × $8/hour = $16

**Step 3: Calculate total earnings for both days.**
- **Total earnings:** $64 (Monday) + $16 (Tuesday) = $80

" Oliver is at the library helping put away books. There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Oliver is at the library helping put away books. There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? 
                 Okay, so I have this problem here where Oliver is helping put away books at the library. There are 46 books in total. A librarian takes 10 of them, so Oliver is left with 46 minus 10, which is 36 books. Now, the question is, how many shelves will he need if he can fit 4 books on each shelf.

Alright, let me break this down. First, the total number of books is 46. Then, the librarian takes 10, so that leaves Oliver with 36 books. Now, each shelf can hold 4 books. So, I need to figure out how many shelves are required to hold 36 books when each shelf holds 4 books.

Hmm, okay, so this seems like a division problem. If I divide the number of books Oliver has by the number of books each shelf can hold, that should give me the number of shelves needed. So, that would be 36 divided by 4. Let me write that out: 36 ÷ 4.

Calculating that, 4 goes into 36 nine times because 4 times 9 is 36. So, that would mean Oliver needs 9 shelves to put away all the remaining books. But wait, let me double-check that because sometimes these problems can have a twist.

Wait, if he has 36 books and each shelf holds 4, then 36 divided by 4 is 9. So, he would need exactly 9 shelves with no books left over, right? Because 9 shelves times 4 books per shelf is 36. So, that seems correct.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in subtracting the books the librarian took. Total books are 46, and the librarian took 10, so 46 minus 10 is indeed 36. Yeah, that's right. So, 36 books left for Oliver.

Another way to think about it is: If each shelf can hold 4 books, how many groups of 4 can we make from 36? Well, each group is a shelf, so 36 divided by 4 is 9 groups. Therefore, 9 shelves.

I don't think there's any chance of needing an extra shelf because 36 is perfectly divisible by 4. There are no leftover books that would require an additional shelf. So, it's exactly 9 shelves.

Let me visualize it. Imagine each shelf has 4 spots. If I have 9 shelves, each with 4 spots, that's 9 times 4, which is 36. So, all the books will fit neatly without any overflow onto a new shelf. That makes sense.

I think I've got it. The key steps are: subtract the books taken by the librarian, then divide the remaining books by the number of books per shelf. Since both numbers are exact, the division doesn't leave any remainder, so the number of shelves is straightforward.
</think>

Oliver starts with 46 books. The librarian takes 10, leaving him with 36. Since each shelf holds 4 books, dividing 36 by 4 gives 9 shelves needed.

                 I'm a bit confused about whether I should multiply 4 by 8 or 4 by 2 first. Hmm, maybe I should break it down further.
</think>
To determine the total number of birds in the pet store, I need to calculate the number of parrots and parakeets separately and then add them together.

First, I'll find out how many parrots there are in total. There are 4 cages, and each cage has 8 parrots. So, I multiply the number of cages by the number of parrots per cage:
4 cages × 8 parrots/cage = 32 parrots.

Next, I'll calculate the number of parakeets. There are also 4 cages, and each cage contains 2 parakeets. Therefore, I multiply the number of cages by the number of parakeets per cage:
4 cages × 2 parakeets/cage = 8 parakeets.

Finally, I'll add the number of parrots and parakeets to find the total number of birds:
32 parrots + 8 parakeets = 40 birds.

So, the pet store has a total of 40 birds.

   - **Total parrots = 4 × 8 = 32**

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Parakeets:**
   - **Number of parakeets per cage:** 2
   - **Number of cages:** 4
   - **Total parakeets = Number of cages × Parakeets per cage**
   - **Total parakeets = 4 × 2 = 8**

4. **Find the Total Number of Birds:**
   - **Total birds = Total parrots + Total parakeets**

                 {The final answer is}
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Robin uploaded a total of 31 pictures from her phone and 5 from her camera to Facebook. She sorted these pictures into 9 different albums, with each album having the same number of pictures. We need to find out how many pictures were in each of these albums.

**Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Pictures Uploaded**
First, let's determine the total number of pictures Robin uploaded to Facebook.

- Pictures from phone: 31
- Pictures from camera: 5

**Total Pictures = Pictures from phone + Pictures from camera**
\[
\text{Total Pictures} = 31 + 5 = 36
\]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Albums and the Distribution of Pictures**
Robin has sorted these pictures into 9 different albums, and each album has the same number of pictures. Let's denote the number of pictures in each album as \( x \).

Since there are 9 albums, the total number of pictures can also be expressed as:
\[
\text{Total Pictures} = 9 \times x
\]

**Step 3: Set Up the Equation and Solve for \( x \)**
We know from Step 2 that:
\[
36 = 9 \times x
\]

To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 9:
\[
x = \frac{36}{9} = 4
\]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
To ensure our answer is correct, let's verify it.

- If each album has 4 pictures, then:
\[
9 \text{ albums} \times 4 \text{ pictures per album} = 36 \text{ pictures}
\]
This matches the total number of pictures Robin uploaded.

**Conclusion:**
Each of the 9 albums contains 4 pictures.

</think><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of furniture pieces Maria purchased. She bought 2 new chairs and 2 new tables, which makes a total of 4 furniture items.

Next, I'll consider the time she spent on each piece. Maria spent 8 minutes on each piece of furniture. Since there are 4 pieces in total, I'll multiply the number of pieces by the time spent on each piece.

Finally, I'll calculate the total time by multiplying 4 (the number of furniture pieces) by 8 minutes (the time spent on each piece), which gives a total of 32 minutes.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the total number of furniture pieces:**
   
   Maria bought:
   - 2 chairs
   - 2 tables

   Total pieces = 2 (chairs) + 2 (tables) = **4 pieces**.

2. **Calculate the time spent on each piece:**
   
   She spent **8 minutes** on each piece of furniture.

3. **Compute the total time required:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Number of pieces} \times \text{Time per piece}

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
First, I need to determine how many cups of flour Isabel used in total for the brownies she baked.

She baked 3 brownies, and each one requires 5 cups of flour. So, the total flour used is 3 multiplied by 5, which equals 15 cups.

Next, I'll calculate how many more cups of flour she needs for the remaining brownies.

Isabel needs a total of 5 brownies, and she has already baked 3. Therefore, she needs 5 minus 3, which is 2 more brownies.

Each of these remaining brownies requires 5 cups of flour, so the additional flour needed is 2 multiplied by 5, resulting in 10 cups.

Finally, adding the flour she has already used to the additional flour needed gives the total amount she still requires. So, 15 cups used plus 10 cups needed equals a total of 25 cups of flour.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total flour used:**
   
   - Isabel baked **3 brownies**.
   - Each brownie requires **5 cups of flour**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total flour used} = 3 \text{ brownies} \times 5 \text{ cups per brownie} = 15 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of brownies needed:**
   
   - She needs **5 total brownies**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total brownies needed} = 5
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional brownies needed:**
   
   - She has already baked **3 brownies**.
   
   \[
   \text{Additional brownies needed} = 5 \text{ total} - 3 \text{ baked} = 2 \text{ brownies}
   \]

4. **Calculate the additional flour needed for the remaining brownies:**
   
   - Each additional brownie requires **5 cups of flour**.
   
   \[
   \text{Additional flour needed} = 2 \text{ brownies} \times 5 \text{ cups per brownie} = 10 \text{ cups}
   \]

5. **Determine the total flour still needed:**
   
   - Total flour used: **15 cups**
   - Additional flour needed: **10 cups**

                    question:
                     Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair. He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth and decided to use the rest on rides. If each ride cost 4 tickets, how many rides could he go on? 
                 }
Okay, so Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair. Hmm, he went to the 'dunk a clown' booth and used 28 tickets there. Now, he wants to use the remaining tickets on rides. Each ride costs 4 tickets. The question is asking how many rides he could go on. 

Alright, let me break this down. First, he started with 40 tickets. He used 28 tickets at the dunk a clown booth. So, to find out how many tickets he has left, I need to subtract the 28 tickets he used from the total 40 tickets. 

Let me do the math: 40 minus 28 equals... let's see, 40 minus 20 is 20, and then minus 8 more is 12. So, he has 12 tickets left.

Now, each ride costs 4 tickets. So, to find out how many rides he can go on, I need to divide the number of remaining tickets by the cost per ride. That would be 12 divided by 4.

Calculating that, 12 divided by 4 is 3. So, he can go on 3 rides.

Wait, let me double-check that. 3 rides at 4 tickets each would use 12 tickets. Yep, that adds up because he had 12 tickets left. So, that seems correct.
</think>

Tom bought 40 tickets in total. He used 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth. To find out how many tickets he has left, subtract the 28 tickets used from the total:

40 tickets - 28 tickets = 12 tickets remaining.

Each ride costs 4 tickets. To determine how many rides Tom can go on, divide the remaining tickets by the cost per ride:

12 tickets ÷ 4 tickets per ride = 3 rides.

Therefore, Tom can go on 3 rides. {The final answer is}.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",3

                     In fourth grade there were 31 students at the start of the year. During the year 5 students left and 11 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end? 
                 

</think>
Okay, so I've got this math problem here about fourth-grade students. Let me see if I can figure it out. Alright, the problem says there were 31 students at the start of the year. Then, during the year, 5 students left, and 11 new students came. I need to find out how many students were there at the end of the year.

Hmm, okay, let me break this down. First, there were 31 students at the beginning. Then, some students left and some new ones came. So, I guess I need to figure out how these changes affect the total number of students.

Let me write down what I know:

- Start of the year: 31 students.
- Students who left: 5.
- New students who came: 11.

I think the first step is to determine the total number of changes. So, 5 students left, and 11 came in. That means a net change of... hmm, let me subtract the number of students who left from the number who came. So, 11 minus 5 equals 6. So, there's a net gain of 6 students.

Wait, is that right? If 11 come in and 5 leave, the net change is indeed 6. So, the total number of students increases by 6.

Now, to find the total number at the end, I need to add this net change to the original number of students. So, 31 plus 6. Let me do that calculation. 31 plus 6 is 37.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with 31, subtracting 5 gives me 26, and then adding 11 gives me 37. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as adding all the new students first. So, 31 plus 11 is 42. Then, subtract the 5 who left, which gives 37. Yep, same result.

I think I've got it. So, the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year is 37.
</think>

The number of students at the end of the year is calculated by adding the number of new students to the original number and then subtracting the number of students who left.

Step-by-step calculation:
1. Start with 31 students.
2. Add 11 new students: 31 + 11 = 42.
3. Subtract the 5 students who left: 42 - 5 = 37.

                    question:
                     While shopping, Maria bought 35 green towels and 21 white towels. If she gave her mother 34 of them, how many towels did Maria end up with? 
                 I need to figure out how many towels Maria has after giving 34 to her mother. She originally bought 35 green and 21 white. So, first, I need to determine how many of each color she gave her mother. 

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the towels given were green or white. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's assuming that all towels are of the same color? But that doesn't make sense because she bought two different colors. 

Alternatively, perhaps she gave away an equal number of green and white towels, or maybe she gave away all of one color and some of the other. The problem isn't clear. I need to make an assumption here. Maybe it's safest to assume that she gave away all 35 green towels and all 21 white towels, totaling 56. But then she would have none left. But the question is asking how many towels she ended up with, implying she still has some. 

Alternatively, maybe she gave away 34 towels in total, not necessarily all of one color. So she could have given some green and some white towels, but the problem doesn't specify how many of each. This is tricky. 

Wait, maybe the key is that she gave her mother 34 towels, which could be a mix of green and white, but without knowing the exact number of each color given away, I can't determine how many she has left. This seems like a missing piece of information. 

Alternatively, perhaps the towels are all the same color, but the problem states two different colors. Maybe the towels are indistinct aside from color, but without knowing how many of each she gave, I can't calculate the remaining. 

I think I need to make an assumption here. Maybe she gave away all of one color and some of the other. For example, she gave away all 35 green towels and 0 white towels, but that's only 35 towels, which is less than 34. Wait, no, 35 is more than 34. So perhaps she gave 34 towels in total, which could be a combination of green and white. 

Wait, but without knowing how many of each she gave, I can't determine the exact number left. Maybe the problem is expecting a total number, regardless of color. So she gave away 34 towels, so she has 35 + 21 - 34 = 22 towels left. But is that the case? 

Wait, that would be if she gave away 34 towels in total, regardless of color. So total towels she has is 35 + 21 = 56. She gave away 34, so 56 - 34 = 22. So she has 22 towels left. 

But the problem is, the question is a bit ambiguous because it doesn't specify whether the 34 towels are of a specific color or a total. If it's total, then 22 is the answer. If it's specific, we can't determine. 

I think the problem is expecting the total number, so the answer is 22. But to be sure, let me think again. 

She bought 35 green and 21 white. Total 56. She gave 34 towels. So she has 56 -34=22. So the answer is 22.
</think>

Maria originally purchased 35 green towels and 21 white towels, totaling 56 towels. She gave away 34 towels to her mother. To find out how many towels she has left, subtract the number of towels she gave away from the total she had:

56 (total towels) - 34 (towels given) = 22 towels.

                    question:
                     Paul was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday he filled 6 bags up and on Sunday he filled 3 more bags. If each bag had 8 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total? 
                 

Okay, so Paul is collecting cans for recycling. Hmm, let's see. The problem says he filled 6 bags on Saturday and 3 more on Sunday. Each bag has 8 cans. I need to figure out the total number of cans he picked up.

First, I should probably figure out how many cans are in each set of bags. On Saturday, he filled 6 bags, each with 8 cans. So, 6 times 8 cans. Let me calculate that. 6 times 8 is 48. So, 48 cans on Saturday.

Then, on Sunday, he filled 3 more bags. Each bag still has 8 cans. So, 3 times 8 cans. Calculating that, 3 times 8 is 24. So, 24 cans on Sunday.

Now, to find the total number of cans, I need to add the cans from Saturday and Sunday together. That would be 48 cans plus 24 cans. Let me add those up. 48 plus 24 is 72. 

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 6 bags times 8 cans is indeed 48. 3 bags times 8 cans is 24. Adding 48 and 24 gives 72. Yeah, that seems right.

So, putting it all together, Paul collected a total of 72 cans.
</think>

Paul collected cans over two days. On Saturday, he filled 6 bags, each containing 8 cans. On Sunday, he filled 3 additional bags, each also containing 8 cans. To find the total number of cans collected, we calculate the number of cans from each day and sum them.

1. **Cans collected on Saturday:**
   \[
   6 \text{ bags} \times 8 \text{ cans per bag} = 48 \text{ cans}
   \]

2. **Cans collected on Sunday:**
   \[
   3 \text{ bags} \times 8 \text{ cans per bag} = 24 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Total cans collected:**
   \[
   48 \text{ cans} + 24 \text{ cans} = 72 \text{ cans}
   \]

Therefore, Paul collected a total of \boxed{72} cans. {The final answer is}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",72

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Bianca and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Bianca recycled 24 pounds and her friends recycled 3 pounds, how many points did they earn? 
                 }
Okay, so Bianca and her friends are recycling paper to earn points for their class. The problem says that for every 3 pounds they recycle, they earn one point. Bianca recycled 24 pounds, and her friends recycled 3 pounds. I need to figure out how many points they earned in total.

First, I think I should figure out how many points Bianca earned by herself. She recycled 24 pounds. Since they earn one point for every 3 pounds, I can divide the number of pounds she recycled by 3 to find her points. So, 24 divided by 3 is 8. That means Bianca earned 8 points on her own.

Next, I need to calculate how many points her friends earned. They recycled 3 pounds. Using the same method, I'll divide 3 by 3. 3 divided by 3 is 1. So, her friends earned 1 point.

Now, to find the total points they earned together, I should add Bianca's points and her friends' points. That means adding 8 and 1 together. 8 plus 1 equals 9. So, altogether, they earned 9 points.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Bianca had 24 pounds, which divided by 3 is indeed 8. Her friends had 3 pounds, which is 1 point. Adding them gives 9. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think there's any other way to interpret the problem. It's straightforward: points are based on the total pounds recycled, and each 3 pounds give one point. So, adding both individuals' points is the correct approach. I don't see any complications or alternative methods needed here.
</think>

Bianca recycled 24 pounds, which is 24 ÷ 3 = 8 points. Her friends recycled 3 pounds, which is 3 ÷ 3 = 1 point. Together, they earned 8 + 1 = 9 points.

{The final answer is 9 points.}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",9

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
There are 2 new players and 6 returning players on the school's baseball team. The coach wants to divide them into groups with 4 players in each group. How many groups will there be?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Total Number of Players:**

" A waiter had 22 customers in his section. If 14 of them left and the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table, how many tables did he have? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     A waiter had 22 customers in his section. If 14 of them left and the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table, how many tables did he have? 
                 Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the waiter has 22 customers in his section. Out of these, 14 left. Hmm, so that means how many customers remained? Let me subtract 14 from 22. 22 minus 14 is 8. So, there are 8 customers left.

Now, the problem says that the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table. So, these 8 customers are distributed among the tables, with each table having 4 people. To find out how many tables there are, I need to divide the number of remaining customers by the number of people per table. That would be 8 divided by 4. 

8 divided by 4 is 2. So, does that mean there are 2 tables? Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.

He started with 22 customers. 14 left, so 22 minus 14 is 8. These 8 are spread across tables with 4 people each. So, 8 divided by 4 is indeed 2 tables. That seems right. 

But let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using algebra. Let's let T be the number of tables. Each table has 4 customers, so the total number of customers would be 4T. But we know that 14 customers left, so the original number minus the ones who left equals the ones remaining. So, 22 minus 14 is 8. So, 4T equals 8. Then, solving for T, we divide both sides by 4, which gives T equals 2. Yep, same answer. So, that confirms it.

I don't think I've missed anything here. The key was figuring out how many customers remained and then determining how many tables with 4 people each would accommodate them. So, the number of tables is 2.
</think>

The waiter initially had 22 customers. After 14 left, 8 remained. Each table holds 4 people, so the number of tables is 8 divided by 4, which is 2.

                    question:
                     Roger had 120 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 48 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 9 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads? 
                 1. First, determine how many pieces of clothing Roger had after putting the first load into the washing machine.
                  Roger initially had 120 pieces. He put 48 into the first load. So, 120 minus 48 equals 72 pieces remaining.

2. Next, he decided to split the remaining 72 pieces into 9 equal loads. To find out how many pieces go into each small load, divide the total remaining pieces by the number of loads.
72 divided by 9 equals 8. So, each small load can have 8 pieces of clothing.
</think><think>
Roger needs to wash a total of 120 pieces of clothing. He starts by washing 48 pieces in the first load. 

After the first load, there are 120 minus 48, which equals 72 pieces remaining.

**Solution:**

Roger has a total of **120** pieces of clothing to wash. He decides to split this task into multiple loads as follows:

1. **First Load:**
   - Roger puts **48** pieces of clothing into the first load.
   
2. **Remaining Pieces After First Load:**
   - Total pieces: **120**
   - Pieces used in first load: **48**
   - Remaining pieces:

3. **Splitting the Remaining Pieces into Equal Loads:**
   - Roger decides to split the remaining **72** pieces into **9** equal loads.
   - To find out how many pieces go into each small load, divide the remaining pieces by the number of loads:
     \[
     \frac{72}{9} = 8

                     Roger is at the library helping put away books. There are 14 book to put away total but a librarian takes 2 of them and leaves Roger with the rest. If he can fit 3 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? 
                 Okay, so I have this problem here where Roger is helping put away books at the library. There are 14 books in total. But then a librarian takes 2 of them, leaving Roger with the rest. Now, I need to figure out how many shelves Roger will need if he can fit 3 books on each shelf.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, there are 14 books in total. Then the librarian takes 2, so how many are left? Let me subtract 2 from 14. That gives me 12 books. Okay, so Roger has 12 books left to put away.

Now, the next part is about how many shelves he needs. He can fit 3 books on each shelf. So, I think I need to divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf. That is, 12 divided by 3.

Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. 12 divided by 3. Well, 3 goes into 12 four times. So, that would mean he needs 4 shelves. Is there any more to this problem? Hmm, let me double-check.

The problem says there are 14 books total. A librarian takes 2, so 14 minus 2 is 12. Then, each shelf holds 3 books. So, 12 divided by 3 is 4. Yeah, that seems straightforward.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. Sometimes problems can have tricks, but this one seems pretty simple. Just basic subtraction and division. No need to complicate it further.

So, putting it all together: 14 total books minus 2 taken by the librarian equals 12 books left. Then, 12 divided by 3 books per shelf equals 4 shelves needed. That makes sense. I don't see any other way to approach this problem.

Wait, could it be that the librarian takes 2 books and Roger has to put them somewhere? No, the problem says the librarian takes 2 and leaves Roger with the rest. So, the 2 books are taken away, so they aren't part of the 12 that need to be shelved. So, yeah, 12 divided by 3 is definitely 4.

I think I've considered all possibilities here. There's no mention of any other constraints or details, so I'm confident that the answer is 4 shelves.
</think>

Roger is at the library helping put away books. There are 14 books in total, but a librarian takes 2, leaving him with 12. Since he can fit 3 books on each shelf, he needs 12 divided by 3, which is 4 shelves.

                    question:
                     At a company picnic 9 managers and 15 employees decided to start a game of volleyball. If they split into 8 teams how many people would be on each team? 
                 {Think step by step}

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a company picnic where 9 managers and 15 employees decide to play volleyball. They want to split into 8 teams, and I need to figure out how many people would be on each team. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should figure out the total number of people involved. There are 9 managers and 15 employees, so adding those together, that's 9 + 15. Let me do that math: 9 plus 15 is 24. So, there are 24 people in total at the picnic who want to play volleyball.

Now, the problem says they split into 8 teams. I need to find out how many people are on each team. To do that, I think I need to divide the total number of people by the number of teams. So that would be 24 divided by 8. Let me calculate that: 24 ÷ 8. Hmm, 8 goes into 24 three times because 8 times 3 is 24. So, each team would have 3 people.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check. If there are 8 teams and each has 3 people, that's 8 times 3, which is 24. Yep, that adds up. So, 24 people divided equally by 8 teams is 3 people per team. 

I don't think there's anything wrong with this reasoning. It seems straightforward. They didn't mention any specific rules about team sizes or if some teams need more people than others, so I guess it's a fair split. Each person gets to be on a team with two others, which makes 3 per team.
</think>

To determine how many people would be on each team, we start by calculating the total number of participants. There are 9 managers and 15 employees, so:

9 + 15 = 24 people in total.

Next, we divide the total number of people by the number of teams, which is 8:

24 ÷ 8 = 3.

Therefore, each team will have 3 people.

                 }
</think>
To determine how many books are in the bin after the changes, I'll start by identifying the initial number of books in the bin.

Next, I'll account for the books sold. The store sold 3 books, which means there are 3 fewer books remaining in the bin.

After the sale, 10 additional books are added to the bin. This will increase the number of books in the bin.

Finally, I'll calculate the total number of books in the bin by adding the remaining books after the sale to the newly added books.

By following these steps, I can find the final number of books in the bin.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem:**
A book store had 4 books in the bargin bin. If they sold 3 books, but then put 10 more in the bin, how many books would be in the bin?

**Solution:**

1. **Initial Number of Books in the Bin:**
   
   The store starts with **4** books in the bargin bin.

   \[
   \text{Initial books} = 4
   \]

2. **Books Sold:**
   
   The store sold **3** books.

   \[
   \text{Books sold} = 3
   \]

3. **Books Remaining After Sale:**
   
   To find out how many books are left after selling 3, subtract the sold books from the initial count.

   \[
   \text{Books remaining} = \text{Initial books} - \text{Books sold} = 4 - 3 = 1
   \]

4. **Adding More Books to the Bin:**
   
   After selling 3 books, the store adds **10** more books to the bin.

   \[
   \text{Books added} = 10
   \]

5. **Total Books in the Bin After the Sale and Addition:**
   
   Add the remaining books to the newly added books to find the total number of books in the bin.

   \[
   \text{Total books} = \text{Books remaining} + \text{Books added} = 1 + 10 = 11

                    question:
                     Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 8 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? 
                 1. **Understand the problem:**
                    Olivia has a total number of pictures she wants to upload. She has 5 from her phone and 35 from her camera. So, the total number is 5 + 35 = 40 pictures.

                    She wants to sort these into 8 different albums, and each album has the same number of pictures. So, we need to divide 40 by 8 to find how many pictures are in each album.

                    40 divided by 8 is 5. So, each album has 5 pictures.

                    Wait, but 8 albums times 5 pictures is 40, which matches the total number. So, that seems straightforward.

                    However, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem mentions she uploaded pictures from her phone and camera, but it doesn't specify any constraints based on the source. So, each album can have any combination of phone and camera pictures.

                    Also, the problem says ""sorted into 8 different albums,"" which implies that each album must have at least one picture. Since 5 is a positive integer and 8 times 5 is 40, which is exactly the total number, there's no issue here.

                    So, my initial thought seems correct. Each album will have 5 pictures.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded.**
   - Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera.
   - Total pictures = 5 (phone) + 35 (camera) = 40 pictures.

2. **Calculate the number of pictures per album.**
   - Olivia sorted these 40 pictures into 8 different albums, with each album containing the same number of pictures.
   - Number of pictures per album = Total pictures ÷ Number of albums = 40 ÷ 8 = 5 pictures.

3. **Verify the distribution.**

</think>
To determine how many baggies Robin can make, I need to calculate the number of complete baggies from each type of cookie separately.

First, I'll calculate the number of baggies from the chocolate chip cookies. Since each baggie holds 6 cookies, I'll divide the total number of chocolate chip cookies by 6.

Next, I'll do the same for the oatmeal cookies by dividing the total number of oatmeal cookies by 6.

Finally, I'll add the number of baggies from both types of cookies to find the total number of baggies Robin can make.
</think>

**Solution:**

Robin is making baggies with **6 cookies** in each bag. She has two types of cookies:

1. **Chocolate chip cookies:** **23** pieces
2. **Oatmeal cookies:** **25** pieces

To find out how many baggies she can make, we need to calculate the number of complete baggies from each type of cookie and then add them together.

### Step 1: Calculate baggies from Chocolate Chip Cookies
\[
\text{Number of baggies} = \left\lfloor \frac{23}{6} \right\rfloor
\]
\[
\text{Number of baggies} = 3 \text{ (since 6 × 3 = 18; 23 - 18 = 5 remaining cookies)}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate baggies from Oatmeal Cookies
\[
\text{Number of baggies} = \left\lfloor \frac{25}{6} \right\rfloor
\]
\[
\text{Number of baggies} = 4 \text{ (since 6 × 4 = 24; 25 - 24 = 1 remaining cookie)}

" Wendy uploaded 22 pictures from her phone and 2 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 4 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>

                    question:
                     Wendy uploaded 22 pictures from her phone and 2 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 4 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? 
                 

Okay, so Wendy has uploaded 22 pictures from her phone and 2 from her camera to Facebook. That means in total, she has 22 + 2, which is 24 pictures. Now, she wants to sort these pictures into 4 different albums, and each album should have the same number of pictures. Hmm, so I need to figure out how many pictures will be in each album.

Alright, let me break this down. The total number of pictures is 24, and she wants to divide them equally into 4 albums. So, I think I need to divide 24 by 4 to find out how many pictures each album will have. Let me do that calculation: 24 divided by 4 equals 6. So, does that mean each album has 6 pictures?

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. She uploaded 22 from her phone and 2 from her camera. So, does the source matter? Like, does she need to have the same number from each source in each album? The problem doesn't specify that. It just says she sorted the pics into 4 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album. So, I think the source isn't a factor here. It's just about dividing the total number equally.

So, 24 total pictures divided by 4 albums is 6 each. That seems straightforward. I don't think there's a trick here. But let me double-check. Maybe she wants to distribute them so that each album has a certain number from each source. But since the problem doesn't mention anything about the distribution based on the source, I think it's just a simple division problem.

Another way to think about it is, if she has 24 pictures and 4 albums, how many go into each. 24 divided by 4 is 6. So, each album would have 6 pictures. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't see any other way to interpret this. There's no mention of different categories or anything else, so it's just about equal distribution.

I guess I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is pretty straightforward. She has 24 pictures, wants them split into 4 equal albums, so each has 6. That should be the answer.
</think>

Wendy has a total of 24 pictures. To divide them equally into 4 albums, each album will contain 24 ÷ 4 = 6 pictures.

{The final answer is 6 pictures in each album.}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",6

                    question:
                     For Halloween Katie and her sister combined the candy they received. Katie had 8 pieces of candy while her sister had 23. If they ate 8 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left? 
                <think>
First, I identify the total number of candies Katie and her sister have combined. Katie has 8 pieces and her sister has 23 pieces.

Next, I calculate the total by adding Katie's candies to her sister's candies: 8 + 23 = 31.

Then, I determine how many candies they ate on the first night, which is 8 pieces.

Finally, I subtract the number of candies eaten from the total to find out how many candies are left: 31 - 8 = 23.

Therefore, after eating 8 pieces on the first night, Katie and her sister have 23 pieces of candy left.
</think>

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pieces of candy Katie and her sister have left after eating some of them.

**Given:**
- **Katie's candies:** 8 pieces
- **Her sister's candies:** 23 pieces
- **Candies eaten the first night:** 8 pieces

**Step 1: Find the Total Number of Candies**
First, we add the number of candies Katie and her sister have together to find the total number of candies they have.

\[
\text{Total candies} = \text{Katie's candies} + \text{Her sister's candies} = 8 + 23 = 31 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Step 2: Subtract the Candies Eaten**
Next, we subtract the number of candies they ate the first night from the total number of candies to find out how many are left.

\[
\text{Candies left} = \text{Total candies} - \text{Candies eaten} = 31 - 8 = 23 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{23}
\]

                    question:
                     A pet store had 88 puppies. In one day they sold 34 of them and put the rest into cages with 6 in each cage. How many cages did they use? 
                <think>
First, I need to determine how many puppies remain after selling 34.

88 total puppies minus 34 sold equals 54 remaining puppies.

Next, to find out how many cages are needed, I will divide the remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage.

54 divided by 6 equals 9 cages.

Therefore, the pet store used 9 cages.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the number of puppies remaining after selling:**
   
   \[
   88 \text{ (total puppies)} - 34 \text{ (sold)} = 54 \text{ (remaining puppies)}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of cages needed:**
   
   Each cage holds **6** puppies. To find out how many cages are required:
   
   \[
   \frac{54 \text{ (remaining puppies)}}{6 \text{ (puppies per cage)}} = 9 \text{ (cages)}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

                    question:
                     Jerry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 8 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another, how many trips will he make? 
                 {The final answer is}
</think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jerry helping in the cafeteria. He can only carry 8 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another. The question is asking how many trips he'll make in total. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what exactly the problem is asking. Jerry can carry 8 trays in each trip. He has two tables to pick up trays from: one with 9 trays and another with 7. So, he's going to have to make multiple trips to each table, right? The key here is to figure out how many trips he needs to make to each table and then add them together.

Let me start by breaking it down. There are two tables: Table A with 9 trays and Table B with 7 trays. Jerry can carry 8 trays each time. So, for Table A, he needs to figure out how many trips it takes to carry all 9 trays when he can only carry 8 at a time. Similarly, for Table B, he needs to figure out how many trips for 7 trays.

Starting with Table A: 9 trays. Since Jerry can carry 8 trays per trip, he'll need to make more than one trip here. Let's see: in the first trip, he can carry 8 trays, leaving 1 tray remaining. Then, he'll need a second trip to carry that remaining 1 tray. So, that's 2 trips for Table A.

Now, moving on to Table B: 7 trays. Again, Jerry can carry 8 trays each trip, but here he has fewer trays. So, how many trips does he need? Well, in the first trip, he can carry all 7 trays because 7 is less than 8. He doesn't need a second trip because there are not enough trays left for another trip. So, that's just 1 trip for Table B.

Wait a minute, is that right? Let me double-check. If he's carrying 8 trays each time, and Table B only has 7, he can carry all 7 in one trip without needing a second trip. So, yes, 1 trip for Table B.

Now, to find the total number of trips, I need to add the trips from both tables. That would be the trips for Table A plus the trips for Table B. So, 2 trips for Table A plus 1 trip for Table B equals 3 trips in total.

But wait, another thought: maybe I should consider whether Jerry can optimize his trips by combining the tables. Like, can he carry trays from both tables in a single trip? The problem doesn't specify any constraints about that, so I think it's safe to assume that he has to make separate trips to each table. So, he can't combine the trays from both tables in one trip. Therefore, he has to go to each table separately, which means the trips are not combined.

Alternatively, if combining was allowed, he might be able to carry some trays from both tables in a single trip, which could reduce the total number of trips. But since the problem doesn't mention that, I think the standard approach is to consider each table separately.

So, to recap: Table A requires 2 trips, Table B requires 1 trip. Total trips = 2 + 1 = 3 trips.

Let me visualize this to make sure I'm not missing anything. Imagine Jerry starts at Table A, carries 8 trays. Then, he goes back, but since there's only 1 tray left, he picks that up in the second trip. Then, he moves on to Table B, which only has 7 trays. He can carry all 7 in one trip. So, he does 2 trips for Table A and 1 trip for Table B, totaling 3 trips.

Another way to think about it is by dividing the number of trays by the number he can carry each time, rounding up because he can't make a partial trip. So, for Table A: 9 divided by 8 is 1.125, which rounds up to 2 trips. For Table B: 7 divided by 8 is 0.875, which rounds up to 1 trip. Adding them together, 2 + 1 = 3 trips.

I don't see any other factors that could affect the number of trips. There's no mention of rest periods, waiting times, or any other constraints. It's purely about how many trips he needs to carry the trays, considering his carrying capacity.

So, after all that, I'm confident that the total number of trips Jerry will make is 3.
</think>

Jerry needs to make 2 trips to Table A (carrying 8 trays each time) and 1 trip to Table B. Therefore, the total number of trips is 2 + 1 = 3 trips.

Sure, let's break down Faye's score step by step.

**Step 1: Determine the points per treasure.**
Faye earns **7 points** for each treasure she finds.

**Step 2: Calculate the points from the first level.**
She found **2 treasures** on the first level.
Points from the first level = 2 treasures × 7 points/treasure = **14 points**

**Step 3: Calculate the points from the second level.**
She found **6 treasures** on the second level.
Points from the second level = 6 treasures × 7 points/treasure = **42 points**

**Step 4: Add the points from both levels to find the total score.**
Total score = 14 points + 42 points = **56 points**

\]

**Step 2: She Throws Out Some Carrots**

Next, Megan throws out **4 carrots**.

\[
\text{Carrots thrown out} = 4
\]

**Step 3: Megan Picks More Carrots the Next Day**

The next day, Megan picks **46 more carrots**.

\[

**Step 4: Calculate the Total Carrots Megan Has**

To find the total number of carrots Megan has, we need to:

1. **Subtract** the carrots thrown out from the initial ones picked.
2. **Add** the additional carrots picked the next day to this result.

\[
\text{Total carrots} = (\text{Initial carrots picked} - \text{Carrots thrown out}) + \text{Additional carrots picked}

</think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many carrots Nancy has in total. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, Nancy picked 12 carrots from her garden. That seems straightforward. So, she starts with 12 carrots.

Then, she threw out 2 of them. Hmm, okay, so if she had 12 and threw out 2, how many does she have left? Well, 12 minus 2 should give me the number she has after throwing out the bad ones. Let me calculate that: 12 - 2 equals 10. So, she has 10 carrots remaining after throwing out the 2.

Now, the next part says she picked 21 more the next day. So, she adds 21 carrots to her collection. I need to add this to the 10 carrots she had after throwing out the bad ones. So, 10 plus 21 equals... let me see, 10 + 20 is 30, and then plus 1 more is 31. So, that makes 31 carrots.

Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 12, throw out 2, so that's 10. Then she picks 21 more, so 10 + 21 is indeed 31. Yeah, that seems right.

So, putting it all together, she started with 12, lost 2, ended up with 10, and then added 21 more, making the total 31 carrots.

Nancy started with 12 carrots. She threw out 2, leaving her with 10. The next day, she picked 21 more, bringing her total to 31.

                 I need to figure out how many more problems the teacher has to grade. Let's break it down.
</think>
Alright, so I've got this problem here: A worksheet had 4 problems on it. The teacher has 16 worksheets to grade and has already graded 8 of them. I need to figure out how many more problems she has to grade. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I want to understand what the problem is asking. It mentions that each worksheet has 4 problems. So, each sheet the teacher has to grade contains 4 questions or tasks. Now, the teacher has a total of 16 worksheets to grade. That means, in total, there are 16 sheets, each with 4 problems. So, if I multiply the number of worksheets by the number of problems per sheet, I can find the total number of problems the teacher has to grade.

Let me write that down:
Total problems = Number of worksheets × Problems per worksheet
Total problems = 16 × 4
Total problems = 64

Okay, so the teacher has to grade a total of 64 problems. But wait, she's already graded 8 of them. So, to find out how many more problems she needs to grade, I need to subtract the number of problems she's already graded from the total number of problems.

Let me do that:
Problems left to grade = Total problems − Problems already graded
Problems left to grade = 64 − 8
Problems left to grade = 56

So, the teacher has 56 more problems to grade. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with 16 worksheets, each with 4 problems, that's 16 × 4 = 64 total problems. She's already graded 8, so subtracting 8 from 64 gives 56. Yeah, that seems right.

I think I've got it. The teacher has 56 more problems to grade.
</think>

The teacher has to grade a total of 64 problems. She has already graded 8, so she has 56 more problems left to grade.

{The final answer is 56.}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",32
 Paige was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 6 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 5 scarves and 5 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Paige have total? ,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>

                    question:
                     Paige was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 6 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 5 scarves and 5 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Paige have total? 
                 Okay, so I need to figure out how many pieces of winter clothing Paige has in total. Let me break this down step by step. First, she found 6 boxes. Each box has 5 scarves and 5 mittens. Hmm, so I guess I need to calculate the total number of scarves and the total number of mittens, and then add them together.

Let me start with the scarves. If each box has 5 scarves, and there are 6 boxes, I can multiply the number of scarves per box by the number of boxes. So 5 scarves multiplied by 6 boxes. Let me do that: 5 times 6 is 30. So that means there are 30 scarves in total.

Now, onto the mittens. Each box also has 5 mittens. So, similar to the scarves, I'll multiply 5 mittens by 6 boxes. 5 times 6 is again 30. So, there are 30 mittens in total.

Wait, so if I have 30 scarves and 30 mittens, how many pieces of clothing does that make in total? I think I just add them together since each scarf and each mitten is a separate piece. So 30 plus 30 equals 60.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 6 boxes times 5 scarves each: 6×5=30. Yep, that's right. And 6 boxes times 5 mittens each: 6×5=30. Adding them together: 30+30=60. That seems correct.

I don't think there's anything else to consider here. The problem doesn't mention any other types of clothing, so it's just scarves and mittens. Therefore, the total number of pieces of winter clothing Paige has is 60.
</think>

Paige discovered a total of 6 boxes. Each box contains 5 scarves and 5 mittens. To find the total number of scarves, multiply the number of scarves per box by the number of boxes: 5 × 6 = 30. Similarly, for mittens: 5 × 6 = 30. Adding these together gives 30 + 30 = 60 pieces of winter clothing.

{The final answer is 60.}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",60

 Luke was selling his old games. He started out with 57 but sold 39 of them. He packed the rest up putting 2 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? ,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Luke was selling his old games. He started out with 57 but sold 39 of them. He packed the rest up putting 2 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? 
                 I need to find the number of boxes Luke used when he packed the remaining games. He had 57 games initially, sold 39, so he has 57 minus 39 left. Then, he puts 2 games into each box. So, the number of boxes is the remaining games divided by 2. But I need to make sure that if there's an odd number, he'll have to use an extra box. Wait, but does the problem say anything about that? It just says he put 2 games into each box. Hmm. Maybe he can't have a box with just one game. So, if there's an odd number, he has to round up. So, in mathematical terms, it's the ceiling of (57-39)/2. Let me calculate that.

First, 57 minus 39 is 18. Then, 18 divided by 2 is 9. So, 9 boxes. But wait, 18 is exactly divisible by 2, so no need to worry about rounding up. So, the number of boxes is 9.
</think>

To determine how many boxes Luke used, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining games after sale:**
   
   Luke started with 57 games and sold 39 of them.
   
   \[
   57 - 39 = 18 \text{ games remaining}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   
   He packs the remaining games by putting 2 games into each box. Since 18 is exactly divisible by 2, no boxes will be left empty.
   
   \[
   \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ boxes}
   \]

**Final Answer:** Luke used \(\boxed{9}\) boxes.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",9

</think>

Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem:**
A pet store had 13 puppies. In one day, they sold 7 of them and put the rest into cages with 2 in each cage. How many cages did they use?

**Solution:**

1. **Total Number of Puppies Initially:**
   - The pet store starts with **13 puppies**.

2. **Number of Puppies Sold:**
   - They sold **7 puppies** in one day.

3. **Remaining Puppies After Sales:**
   - To find out how many puppies are left after selling, subtract the number sold from the total.
   \[
   13 \text{ puppies} - 7 \text{ puppies} = 6 \text{ puppies}
   \]
   - So, there are **6 puppies** remaining.

4. **Number of Puppies per Cage:**
   - The remaining puppies are to be put into cages with **2 puppies per cage**.

5. **Calculating the Number of Cages Needed:**
   - To find out how many cages are needed, divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage.
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ puppies}}{2 \text{ puppies per cage}} = 3 \text{ cages}
   \]
   - So, they need **3 cages**.

They used **3 cages**. {The final answer is}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>",3
" Faye and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Faye picked 23 and her mother picked 5. If only 12 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Faye and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Faye picked 23 and her mother picked 5. If only 12 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have? 
                 

</think>
Alright, so Faye and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Faye picked 23 carrots, and her mom picked 5. Then, it says that only 12 of the carrots were good. The question is asking how many bad carrots they had in total.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step. First, I need to figure out the total number of carrots they picked together. Faye picked 23, and her mom picked 5, so I can add those together to get the total.

23 (Faye's carrots) + 5 (mom's carrots) = 28 total carrots.

Got that part. So, altogether, they picked 28 carrots. Now, out of these 28, only 12 were good. That means the rest must be bad, right? So, to find the number of bad carrots, I can subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots.

So, 28 total carrots - 12 good carrots = 16 bad carrots.

Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If 12 are good, subtracting that from 28 should give me the number of bad ones. 28 minus 12 is indeed 16.

But hold on, I should also consider whether all the carrots they picked are from the same batch or if there's a possibility that some carrots were already bad before they picked them. The problem doesn't specify anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume that all the carrots they picked are the ones that needed to be evaluated for being good or bad.

Another way to think about it is to consider the number of good and bad carrots separately. If 12 are good, and together they picked 28, then the bad ones would be the remaining. So, 28 minus 12 equals 16. That seems consistent.

I don't see any other factors mentioned in the problem, like different sections of the garden where some carrots are better than others or any other conditions. It's a straightforward problem where we have total picked carrots, subtract the good ones to get the bad ones.

Just to make sure, let's go through it again. Total carrots picked: 23 + 5 = 28. Good carrots: 12. So, bad carrots = 28 - 12 = 16. Yep, that checks out.

I think that's the correct answer. There's no indication of any carrots being overlooked or any other complexities in the problem, so 16 bad carrots is the logical conclusion.
</think>

To determine the number of bad carrots, we start by calculating the total number of carrots picked by Faye and her mother. Faye picked 23 carrots, and her mother picked 5, so together they picked:

23 + 5 = 28 carrots.

Next, we know that 12 of these carrots were good. To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots:

28 - 12 = 16.

Therefore, there were 16 bad carrots.

                <think>
To determine how many bouquets Isabel can still make after 10 flowers wilted, I'll start by calculating the total number of flowers she initially had. She picked 66 flowers in total.

Next, I'll subtract the 10 wilted flowers from the total. This gives her 66 minus 10, which equals 56 remaining flowers.

Since each bouquet requires 8 flowers, I'll divide the remaining 56 flowers by 8 to find out how many complete bouquets she can make. Dividing 56 by 8 results in 7.

Therefore, Isabel can still make 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total flowers picked by Isabel: 66
- Flowers used per bouquet: 8
- Wilted flowers: 10

**Step 1: Calculate the remaining flowers after wilted ones.**

</think>
To determine the total number of tickets Oliver used, I will first calculate the cost for each type of ride he took.

Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times, and each ride costs 7 tickets. So, the total cost for the ferris wheel is 5 multiplied by 7 tickets.

Next, he rode the bumper cars 4 times, with each ride also costing 7 tickets. Therefore, the total cost for the bumper cars is 4 multiplied by 7 tickets.

Finally, I will add the total costs of both rides together to find the overall number of tickets used.

**Solution:**

Let's calculate the total number of tickets Oliver used step by step.

1. **Cost for the Ferris Wheel:**
   
   - Oliver rode the ferris wheel **5 times**.
   - Each ride costs **7 tickets**.
   
   \[

                     Ned was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 50 games from a friend and bought 27 more at a garage sale. If 74 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with? 
                 I need to solve this problem, but I'm a bit confused about how to approach it. Let me try to break it down.

First, let me figure out how many games Ned bought in total. He bought 50 games from a friend and 27 more at a garage sale. So, 50 plus 27 is 77 games in total. Okay, that seems straightforward.

Now, the problem says that 74 of the games didn't work. Hmm, so that means out of the 77 games he bought, 74 were defective. So, how many worked? Well, if 74 didn't work, then the number of working games should be the total games minus the defective ones. So, 77 minus 74 equals 3. So, does that mean Ned has 3 good games?

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check. He bought 50 from a friend and 27 from a garage sale, totaling 77. If 74 didn't work, then the number that did work is 3. That seems correct mathematically, but maybe I'm missing something.

Is there a possibility that the defective games are from a specific group, like from the friend or the garage sale? The problem doesn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume that all 74 defective games are part of the total 77 he bought. Therefore, the good games would indeed be 3.

Wait another thought: 74 didn't work, so 3 worked. So, he has 3 good games. Yeah, that seems to be the answer.

I think I've got it. He bought 77 games, 74 didn't work, so 3 did. So, the answer is 3.
</think>

Ned purchased a total of 77 games (50 from a friend and 27 from a garage sale). Out of these, 74 were defective. To find the number of good games, subtract the defective games from the total games purchased:

77 total games - 74 defective games = 3 good games.

                 Step-by-step explanation:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of each type of cat.
- Siamese cats: 38
- House cats: 25

Step 2: Determine the total number of cats before the sale.
Total cats = Siamese cats + House cats
Total cats = 38 + 25
Total cats = 63

Step 3: Figure out how many cats were sold during the sale.

                     Carol was playing a trivia game. In the first round she scored 17 points and in the second round she scored 6 points. In the last round she lost 16 points. How many points did she have at the end of the game? 
                <think>
I need to determine Carol's total score at the end of the game by adding her points from each round and then subtracting the points she lost.

First, I'll add the points she scored in the first two rounds: 17 points plus 6 points equals 23 points.

Next, I'll subtract the points she lost in the last round from this total: 23 points minus 16 points equals 7 points.

Therefore, Carol ended the game with 7 points.
</think>

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many points Carol had at the end of the game.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Points Scored
Carol scored points in two rounds and lost points in the third round. To find her total score, we'll add her points from the first two rounds and then subtract the points she lost in the last round.

\[
\text{Total Score} = \text{First Round Score} + \text{Second Round Score} - \text{Third Round Loss}

</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem:**  
Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 5 to his little brother. If each box has 3 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Dave still have?

---

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of boxes Dave initially bought.**
Dave bought **12 boxes** of chocolate candy.

---

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes Dave gave to his little brother.**
Dave gave **5 boxes** to his little brother.

---

**Step 3: Find out how many boxes Dave has left after giving some to his brother.**
To find the number of boxes Dave still has:
\[
\text{Boxes left} = \text{Total boxes} - \text{Boxes given away}
\]
\[
\text{Boxes left} = 12 - 5 = 7 \text{ boxes}
\]

---

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of chocolate pieces in the boxes Dave has left.**
Each box contains **3 pieces** of candy.
\[
\text{Total pieces} = \text{Boxes left} \times \text{Pieces per box}
\]
\[
\text{Total pieces} = 7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ pieces}
\]

" A waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 39 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush he added another 12 customers. If 49 of the customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     A waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 39 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush he added another 12 customers. If 49 of the customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip? 
                 Okay, so I have this problem here about a waiter and customers tipping. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details. The waiter had 39 customers to wait on initially. Then during the lunch rush, he added another 12 customers. So, that makes the total number of customers he waited on to be 39 plus 12. Let me calculate that: 39 + 12 is 51. So, in total, there were 51 customers.

Now, the next part says that 49 of the customers didn't leave him a tip. Hmm, so out of all these 51 customers, 49 didn't tip. That means the number of customers who did leave a tip would be the total number minus those who didn't tip. So, I need to subtract 49 from 51 to find out how many left a tip.

Let me do that calculation: 51 minus 49 equals 2. So, does that mean only 2 customers left a tip? That seems really low. Maybe I should double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let's go through it again. Total customers: 39 plus 12 is 51. Customers who didn't tip: 49. So, 51 total minus 49 no-tippers equals 2 tippers. Yeah, that seems correct. So, only 2 customers left a tip.

Hmm, is there another way to look at this problem? Maybe I can think of it in terms of sets or something. Let's see, the total number is the union of the original 39 and the additional 12, so 39 + 12 is indeed 51. The number who didn't tip is 49, so the ones who tipped must be the difference, which is 2. 

Wait, maybe I should consider if there's any overlap between the original 39 and the 12 added. But the problem doesn't mention anything about that, so I think it's safe to assume they are distinct groups. So, no overlaps, just adding them together. So, yeah, 51 total, minus 49 no-tippers, gives 2 tippers.

Is 2 a reasonable number? It seems a bit low, but maybe it's a slow day or something. Anyway, the math checks out. So, I think the answer is 2 customers left a tip.
</think>

The waiter initially had 39 customers and an additional 12 during lunch rush, totaling 51 customers. Since 49 didn't leave a tip, the number who did is 51 minus 49, which equals 2.

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Problem:**
The cafeteria had 50 apples. For lunch, they handed out 5 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 5 apples, how many pies could they make?

---

**Step 1: Determine the number of apples used for lunch.**
The cafeteria started with **50 apples** and handed out **5 apples** to students for lunch.

\[
\text{Apples used for lunch} = 5
\]

---

**Step 2: Calculate the remaining apples after handing out 5 apples.**
Subtract the apples used for lunch from the total number of apples.

\[
\text{Remaining apples} = 50 - 5 = 45
\]

---

**Step 3: Find out how many pies can be made with the remaining apples.**
Each pie requires **5 apples**. To find out how many pies can be made, divide the remaining apples by the number of apples needed per pie.

\[
\text{Number of pies} = \frac{\text{Remaining apples}}{\text{Apples per pie}} = \frac{45}{5} = 9
\]

First, I identify Oliver's initial amount of money, which is \$33.

Next, I account for the amount he spent in March, which is \$4.

Then, I add the additional \$32 that Oliver received from his mom.

Finally, I calculate the total money Oliver has after these transactions.
</think>

Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Identify the Initial Amount**
- **Initial Amount:** Oliver starts with \$33 in January.

**Step 2: Subtract the Amount Spent**
- **Amount Spent:** By March, Oliver spends \$4.
- **Calculation:** \$33 (initial) - \$4 (spent) = \$29

**Step 3: Add the Additional Money Received**
- **Additional Money:** Oliver receives \$32 from his mom.
- **Calculation:** \$29 (after spending) + \$32 (received) = \$61

**Final Answer:**
Oliver would have \$61 after his spending and receiving the additional money.

First, I need to determine how many apples are used for the students' lunches. The cafeteria starts with 14 apples and uses 13 of them.

Next, after using 13 apples, there are 14 minus 13 apples left, which equals 1 apple remaining.

Then, the cafeteria buys 49 more apples to replenish their stock. Adding these 49 apples to the remaining 1 apple gives a total of 50 apples.

Therefore, the school cafeteria would have 50 apples after the students have been served lunch and the additional apples have been purchased.

                 }
</think>
Alright, so I need to figure out Frank's final score in this trivia game. Let's see, he answered 3 questions correctly in the first half and 2 in the second half. Each question is worth 3 points. Hmm, okay, so I think I need to calculate how many points he got in each half and then add them together.

First, for the first half, he got 3 questions right. Each is worth 3 points, so I should multiply 3 by 3. Let me write that down: 3 correct answers * 3 points each. That would be 3 times 3, which is 9 points. Okay, so he has 9 points from the first half.

Now, moving on to the second half. He got 2 questions correct there. Using the same logic, I'll multiply 2 by 3 points. So, 2 * 3 equals 6 points. Got it, so he has 6 points from the second half.

To find his total score, I need to add the points from both halves together. So that's 9 points from the first half plus 6 points from the second half. Adding those together: 9 + 6 equals 15. So, his final score should be 15 points.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3 correct in the first half times 3 points is indeed 9. 2 correct in the second half times 3 points is 6. Adding 9 and 6 gives 15. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. Each question is worth the same, so it's straightforward multiplication and addition.
</think>

Frank's final score is calculated by determining the points earned in each half of the game and then summing them.

1. **First Half:**
   - Correct answers: 3
   - Points per correct answer: 3
   - Total points: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) points

2. **Second Half:**
   - Correct answers: 2
   - Points per correct answer: 3
   - Total points: \(2 \times 3 = 6\) points

3. **Total Score:**
   - Points from first half + Points from second half = \(9 + 6 = 15\) points

                    question:
                     Zoe was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 8 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 4 scarves and 6 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Zoe have total? 
                 Okay, so I need to figure out how many pieces of winter clothing Zoe has in total. Let's see, she found 8 boxes. Inside each box, there are 4 scarves and 6 mittens. Hmm, so each box has both scarves and mittens. I guess I need to find out how many scarves and how many mittens there are in total, and then add them together.

Wait, maybe I should start by calculating the total number of scarves first. Since each box has 4 scarves, and there are 8 boxes, I can multiply 4 by 8 to get the total number of scarves. Let me write that down: 4 scarves/box * 8 boxes = 32 scarves. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, for the mittens. Each box has 6 mittens, so I'll multiply 6 by 8 to find the total number of mittens. 6 mittens/box * 8 boxes = 48 mittens. Okay, that seems right.

So now I have 32 scarves and 48 mittens. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, I need to add the number of scarves and mittens together. That would be 32 + 48. Let me add those: 32 + 48 is... hmm, 32 plus 40 is 72, and then plus 8 more is 80. So, 80 pieces in total.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the scarves: 4 times 8 is 32. Yep, that's correct. For the mittens: 6 times 8 is 48. That adds up too. And adding 32 and 48 gives 80. Yeah, that seems right. So, the total number of pieces of winter clothing Zoe has is 80.
</think>

Zoe found a total of 8 boxes. Each box contains 4 scarves and 6 mittens. To find the total number of scarves, multiply the number of scarves per box by the number of boxes: 4 × 8 = 32 scarves. Similarly, to find the total number of mittens, multiply the number of mittens per box by the number of boxes: 6 × 8 = 48 mittens. Adding these together gives the total number of pieces of winter clothing: 32 + 48 = 80.

**Problem:**
Frank and his friend are buying trick decks from a magic shop. Each deck costs \$7. Frank buys 3 decks, and his friend buys 2 decks. We need to find out how much they spent in total.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Determine the cost per deck:**
   - Each deck costs \$7.
   
2. **Calculate the number of decks Frank bought:**
   - Frank bought 3 decks.

" Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? ","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>

                    question:
                     Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? 
                 I have to figure out how many shirts Sam didn't wash before school. Let me break it down.

First, let's figure out the total number of shirts Sam has to wash. There are two types: short sleeve and long sleeve.

So, short sleeve shirts: 40
Long sleeve shirts: 23
Total shirts = 40 + 23 = 63

Okay, so Sam has a total of 63 shirts to wash.

Now, he only washed 29 of them before school started. But wait, how many of each type did he wash? Hmm, that's not specified. So, I need to consider both possibilities: he might have washed some short sleeve shirts and some long sleeve shirts, or he might have washed all the short sleeve shirts and none of the long sleeve shirts, or any other combination.

But actually, since we don't know how many of each type he washed, maybe I can approach it differently. Instead of trying to split them, perhaps I can calculate the total number of shirts he didn't wash.

He had 63 shirts in total and he washed 29. So, the number of shirts not washed would be 63 minus 29, which is 34.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, regardless of how many of each type he washed, the total number not washed is 34.

But let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Total shirts: 40 short + 23 long = 63.

Washed: 29 shirts.

Not washed: 63 - 29 = 34 shirts.

Yes, that makes sense. He didn't have to wash all of them before school, so 34 is the number he didn't wash.
</think>

Sam had to wash a total of 63 shirts (40 short sleeve + 23 long sleeve). He washed 29 shirts before school. The number of shirts he did not wash is the total minus the ones he washed.

                 {The final answer is}
</think>
First, I identify the initial number of customers the waiter has, which is 47.

Next, I note that 41 customers left. To find out how many customers are left after they leave, I subtract 41 from 47.

Then, the waiter receives 20 new customers. I add these new customers to the remaining number of customers to determine the total number of customers he now has.
