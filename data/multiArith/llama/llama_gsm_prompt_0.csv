                    question:
                     Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Paige initially has 11 songs on her mp3 player.

Step 2: She deletes 9 old songs from her mp3 player. To find the number of songs she has left after deleting 9 songs, I subtract 9 from 11:

11 - 9 = 2

So, Paige has 2 songs left on her mp3 player after deleting 9 old songs.

Step 3: Paige then adds 8 new songs to her mp3 player. To find the total number of songs she has now, I add 8 to the 2 songs she had left:

2 + 8 = 10

Step 4: Therefore, Paige has 10 songs on her mp3 player after deleting 9 old songs and adding 8 new songs.

{The final answer is 10.}<|eot_id|>",10
" There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut? ","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

                    question:
                     There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of students trying out for the team.
We know there were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out. To find the total number of students, we add these two numbers together:
39 (girls) + 4 (boys) = 43

Step 2: Identify the number of students who got called back.
We know that only 26 students got called back. This means that the remaining students did not make the cut.

Step 3: Find the number of students who did not make the cut.
To find the number of students who did not make the cut, we subtract the number of students who got called back (26) from the total number of students trying out (43):
43 (total students) - 26 (students who got called back) = 17

{The final answer is 17 students did not make the cut.}<|eot_id|>",17

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of bags Megan recycled.
Megan had 14 bags, but didn't recycle 5 of them. To find the number of bags she recycled, we subtract the number of bags she didn't recycle from the total number of bags:

14 (total bags) - 5 (bags not recycled) = 9 bags recycled

Step 2: Calculate the points Megan would earn for each bag recycled.
Megan earns 8 points for each bag recycled. Since she recycled 9 bags, we multiply the number of bags recycled by the points earned per bag:

9 (bags recycled) × 8 (points per bag) = 72 points

Step 3: Determine the total points Megan would earn.
We calculated the points Megan would earn for each bag recycled in Step 2. To find the total points, we simply add up the points earned for each bag:

72 points

April had 4 roses left.

Step 3: Calculate the number of roses April sold.
To find the number of roses April sold, subtract the number of roses left from the initial number of roses:
13 (initial roses) - 4 (roses left) = 9

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from the sale of roses.
Since each rose was $4, multiply the number of roses sold by the price of each rose:
9 (roses sold) × $4 (price per rose) = $36

Step 5: Determine the total revenue earned by April.
The total revenue earned by April is the revenue from the sale of roses:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of shirts Ned had to wash.
Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts. To find the total number of shirts, we add these two numbers together:

9 (short sleeve) + 21 (long sleeve) = 30 shirts

Step 2: Determine how many shirts Ned washed before school started.
According to the problem, Ned washed 29 shirts before school started.

Step 3: Find the number of shirts Ned did not wash.
To find the number of shirts Ned did not wash, we subtract the number of shirts he washed (29) from the total number of shirts he had to wash (30):

30 (total shirts) - 29 (shirts washed) = 1 shirt

The company invited 47 people to the luncheon.

Step 2: Identify the number of people who didn't show up.
7 people didn't show up.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of people who actually attended the luncheon.
47 (total invited) - 7 (didn't show up) = 40 people attended.

Step 4: Determine the number of tables needed.
Each table holds 5 people, so to accommodate the 40 people who attended, we need to divide 40 by 5.

40 ÷ 5 = 8

Step 5: Round up to the nearest whole number (since you can't have a fraction of a table).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Tom had 5 books initially.

Step 2: He sold 4 of them. To find out how many books he has left, we subtract 4 from 5:

5 (initial books) - 4 (books sold) = 1

So, Tom has 1 book left after selling 4.

Step 3: Tom used the money he earned from selling 4 books to buy 38 new books.

Step 4: Since Tom has 1 book left, we add the 38 new books to it:

1 (book left) + 38 (new books) = 39

Step 5: Therefore, Tom would have a total of 39 books.

{The final answer is 39.}<|eot_id|>",39

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sodas Jerry has.
Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. To find the total number of sodas, we add these two numbers together:

41 (regular sodas) + 22 (diet sodas) = 63 sodas

Step 2: Determine the maximum number of sodas Jerry can store on each shelf.
Jerry's fridge has 9 shelves, and each shelf can hold 9 sodas. This means that Jerry can store a maximum of:

9 (sodas per shelf) x 9 (shelves) = 81 sodas

Step 3: Calculate how many shelves Jerry needs to fill up.
Jerry has 63 sodas in total, and his fridge can hold a maximum of 81 sodas. To find out how many shelves Jerry needs to fill up, we divide the total number of sodas by the maximum number of sodas that can be stored on each shelf:

63 (total sodas) ÷ 9 (sodas per shelf) = 7

Step 4: Check if Jerry needs to fill up any extra shelves.
Since Jerry has 63 sodas and his fridge can hold 81 sodas, he will not need to fill up all 9 shelves. He will need to fill up 7 shelves, leaving 2 shelves empty.

{The final answer is} Jerry needs to fill up 7 shelves.<|eot_id|>",7

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of candy Emily received.

Emily received 5 pieces from her neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister. To find the total number of pieces, I add these amounts together:

5 (from neighbors) + 13 (from sister) = 18 pieces

{Step 1 result: Emily has 18 pieces of candy.}

Step 2: Calculate how many pieces Emily eats per day.

Emily eats 9 pieces of candy per day. This is her daily consumption.

{Step 2 result: Emily eats 9 pieces of candy per day.}

Step 3: Calculate how many days the candy will last Emily.

To find out how many days the candy will last, I divide the total number of pieces Emily has (18) by the number of pieces she eats per day (9):

18 pieces ÷ 9 pieces/day = 2 days

{Step 3 result: The candy will last Emily for 2 days.}

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of windows left to be installed.
The builder needs to install 9 windows, and he has already installed 6. To find the number of windows left, we subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed:

9 (total windows) - 6 (windows already installed) = 3

{Step 1: 3 windows are left to be installed.}

Step 2: Determine the time it takes to install one window.
It takes 6 hours to install each window.

{Step 2: It takes 6 hours to install one window.}

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to install the remaining windows.
We need to install 3 windows, and each window takes 6 hours. To find the total time, we multiply the number of windows by the time it takes to install one window:

* Each adult meal costs $7, so the total cost of the adult meals is:
4 adults × $7/adult = $28

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the kids' meals.

* Since kids eat free, the cost of the kids' meals is $0.

Step 4: Add the cost of the adult meals and the kids' meals to get the total cost for the group.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of roses April had.
April started with 9 roses.

Step 2: Identify the number of roses April sold.
April had 4 roses left, which means she sold 9 - 4 = 5 roses.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money April earned from selling the roses.
Each rose was $7, and April sold 5 roses. To find the total amount of money she earned, multiply the number of roses sold by the price of each rose:

5 roses × $7 per rose = $35

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money April earned, considering she had 4 roses left.
April started with 9 roses and sold 5, leaving her with 4 roses. Since she earned $35 from selling the roses, she must have earned that amount from selling the 5 roses. The 4 roses she had left are not part of the calculation.

                     A pet store had 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats. During a sale they sold 10 cats. How many cats do they have left?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of cats
The pet store has 13 Siamese cats and 5 house cats, so the total number of cats initially is:
13 (Siamese) + 5 (house) = 18 cats

Step 2: Determine how many cats were sold
During the sale, 10 cats were sold.

Step 3: Subtract the number of sold cats from the initial number of cats
To find the number of cats left, we subtract the number of sold cats from the initial number of cats:
18 (initial cats) - 10 (cats sold) = 8 cats

Step 4: Check for any remaining cats
Since we subtracted 10 cats from the initial 18, we should have 8 cats left.

{The final answer is 8 cats.}<|eot_id|>",8

                    question:
                     Megan baked 71 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 43 of them how many packages could she make if she put 7 cupcake in each package?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Determine the number of cupcakes Megan has left after Todd eats 43 of them.

Megan had 71 cupcakes initially, and Todd ate 43 of them. To find the number of cupcakes left, I'll subtract 43 from 71:

71 - 43 = 28

So, Megan has 28 cupcakes left.

Step 2: Determine how many packages Megan can make with the remaining cupcakes.

Megan wants to put 7 cupcakes in each package. To find out how many packages she can make, I'll divide the number of cupcakes left (28) by 7:

28 ÷ 7 = 4

This means Megan can make 4 packages with the remaining cupcakes.

Step 3: Check if there are any cupcakes left over.

To find out if there are any cupcakes left over, I'll multiply the number of packages Megan can make (4) by the number of cupcakes per package (7):

4 × 7 = 28

Since the result is equal to the number of cupcakes left (28), there are no cupcakes left over.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many more action figures Henry needs to complete his collection.

Henry currently has 3 action figures, but needs 8 total. To find out how many more he needs, we subtract the number he has from the total number needed:

8 (total needed) - 3 (current number) = 5

So, Henry needs 5 more action figures.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the action figures Henry needs to buy.

Each action figure costs $6, and Henry needs to buy 5 more. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of action figures needed by the cost per figure:

5 (action figures needed) x $6 (cost per figure) = $30

Step 3: Determine the total amount of money Henry needs to finish his collection.

Henry already has 3 action figures, which he can keep. He needs to buy 5 more, which will cost $30. To find the total amount of money he needs, we add the cost of the new action figures to the cost of the ones he already has:

$0 (cost of existing figures) + $30 (cost of new figures) = $30

Step 3: Determine the total amount of money Frank has now.
Frank now has a total of 40 dollars.

Step 4: Find out how many 8-dollar toys Frank can buy.
To find out how many 8-dollar toys Frank can buy, we need to divide the total amount of money he has (40 dollars) by the cost of each toy (8 dollars).

40 dollars ÷ 8 dollars per toy =?

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of worksheets the teacher has to grade.
The teacher has 17 worksheets to grade.

Step 2: Identify the number of worksheets the teacher has already graded.
The teacher has already graded 8 worksheets.

Step 3: Subtract the number of worksheets already graded from the total number of worksheets to find the number of worksheets left to grade.
17 (total worksheets) - 8 (already graded) = 9

Step 4: Each worksheet has 7 problems. To find the total number of problems left to grade, multiply the number of worksheets left to grade by the number of problems per worksheet.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of players.
There were 8 friends playing the game initially.

Step 2: Determine the number of new players joining the game.
2 more players joined the game, so the total number of players is:
8 (initial players) + 2 (new players) = 10

Step 3: Identify the number of lives each player has.
Each player has 6 lives.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of lives for the initial players.
Since there are 8 initial players, the total number of lives they have is:
8 (players) x 6 (lives per player) = 48

Step 5: Calculate the total number of lives for the new players.
Since there are 2 new players, the total number of lives they have is:
2 (players) x 6 (lives per player) = 12

Step 6: Calculate the total number of lives for all players.
The total number of lives for all players is the sum of the lives for the initial players and the new players:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate Jerry's total earnings
Jerry made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 31 dollars weed eating, so his total earnings are:
14 + 31 = 45 dollars

Step 2: Calculate Jerry's weekly expenses
Jerry spends 5 dollars a week, so his weekly expenses are:
5 dollars

Step 3: Calculate Jerry's total expenses
Since Jerry spends 5 dollars a week, we need to calculate his total expenses over a certain period. Let's call this period ""x"" weeks. Then, Jerry's total expenses would be:
5x dollars

Step 4: Set up the equation
Since Jerry's money will last as long as his total expenses are less than or equal to his total earnings, we can set up the following equation:
45 dollars ≥ 5x dollars

Step 5: Solve for x
To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:
x ≤ 45/5
x ≤ 9

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Nancy has 2 shelves of mystery books and 6 shelves of picture books. We also know that each shelf has exactly 6 books on it.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of mystery books.
Since there are 2 shelves of mystery books, and each shelf has 6 books, we can calculate the total number of mystery books as:
2 shelves x 6 books/shelf = 12 mystery books

Step 3: Calculate the total number of picture books.
Since there are 6 shelves of picture books, and each shelf has 6 books, we can calculate the total number of picture books as:
6 shelves x 6 books/shelf = 36 picture books

Step 4: Add the total number of mystery books and picture books to find the total number of books.
We can add the total number of mystery books (12) and picture books (36) to get:
12 + 36 = 48 books

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Oliver has 46 books initially, but the librarian takes 10 of them. To find out how many books Oliver is left with, we subtract 10 from 46:

46 - 10 = 36

{So, Oliver has 36 books left.}

Step 2: Since Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf, we need to divide the number of books he has left (36) by 4 to find out how many shelves he needs:

36 ÷ 4 = 9

{So, Oliver needs 9 shelves to put away the remaining books.}

The final answer is 9 shelves.<|eot_id|>",9

Since there are 5 piles of quarters, and each pile has 3 coins, the total number of coins in the quarters is:
5 piles x 3 coins per pile = 15 coins

Step 4: Calculate the total number of coins in the dimes.
Since there are 5 piles of dimes, and each pile has 3 coins, the total number of coins in the dimes is:
5 piles x 3 coins per pile = 15 coins

Step 5: Add the total number of coins in the quarters and dimes to find the total number of coins.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Gwen recycled 5 pounds and her friends recycled 13 pounds. We also know that for every 3 pounds recycled, they earn 1 point.

Step 2: Calculate the total pounds recycled by Gwen and her friends.
Gwen recycled 5 pounds, and her friends recycled 13 pounds. To find the total pounds recycled, we add these amounts together:

5 pounds (Gwen) + 13 pounds (friends) = 18 pounds

Step 3: Divide the total pounds recycled by 3 to find the number of times the 3-pound increment is reached.
We need to divide the total pounds recycled (18 pounds) by 3 to find out how many times the 3-pound increment is reached:

18 pounds ÷ 3 = 6

Step 4: Since each 3-pound increment earns 1 point, we multiply the number of times the increment is reached (6) by 1 point.
6 (times the increment is reached) × 1 point = 6 points

Step 5: The final answer is the total number of points earned.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Isabel baked 3 brownies.
* She needed 5 brownies in total for her party.
* She used 5 cups of flour for each brownie.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of flour used for the 3 brownies.

* Since Isabel used 5 cups of flour for each brownie, she used a total of:
5 cups/brownie × 3 brownies = 15 cups of flour

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of flour needed for the 5 brownies.

* Since Isabel needed 5 brownies in total, she needs a total of:
5 cups/brownie × 5 brownies = 25 cups of flour

Step 4: Calculate the amount of flour still needed.

* To find out how much flour Isabel still needs, we subtract the amount of flour used (15 cups) from the total amount of flour needed (25 cups):
25 cups - 15 cups = 10 cups

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of tickets Tom has left after spending 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth.

Tom bought 40 tickets initially, and spent 28 tickets. To find the number of tickets he has left, we subtract the number of tickets spent from the initial number:

40 (initial tickets) - 28 (tickets spent) = 12 tickets left

Step 2: Calculate the number of rides Tom can go on with the remaining 12 tickets.

Each ride costs 4 tickets, so to find the number of rides Tom can go on, we divide the number of tickets left (12) by the cost per ride (4):

12 (tickets left) ÷ 4 (cost per ride) = 3

Step 3: Determine the number of rides Tom can go on.

Since Tom can go on rides with the remaining 12 tickets, and each ride costs 4 tickets, he can go on 3 rides.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Bianca recycled 24 pounds of paper and her friends recycled 3 pounds of paper.

Step 2: Determine the rate at which points are earned.
We are told that for every 3 pounds of paper recycled, 1 point is earned. This means that the rate at which points are earned is 1 point per 3 pounds.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pounds of paper recycled in total.
We know that Bianca recycled 24 pounds and her friends recycled 3 pounds, so the total number of pounds of paper recycled is:

24 pounds (Bianca) + 3 pounds (friends) = 27 pounds

Step 4: Divide the total number of pounds by 3 to find the number of times the rate is earned.
Since we earn 1 point for every 3 pounds, we need to divide the total number of pounds (27) by 3 to find the number of times the rate is earned:

27 pounds ÷ 3 = 9

Step 5: Multiply the result from Step 4 by 1 to find the total number of points earned.
Since we earn 1 point for every 3 pounds, and we earned the rate 9 times (since 27 ÷ 3 = 9), we multiply the result by 1 to find the total number of points earned:

9 × 1 = 9

Initial wings: 8
Additional wings: 10
Total wings: 8 + 10 = 18

**Step 4:** Determine how many chicken wings each of the 3 friends will receive.
Since they each get the same amount, we need to divide the total number of wings by 3.

**Step 5:** Perform the division.
Total wings: 18

Step 1: John had 33 socks initially.
Let's start with this number.

Step 2: John threw away 19 old socks that didn't fit.
To find the number of socks John has left after throwing away 19, we subtract 19 from 33:

33 - 19 = 14

So, John has 14 socks left after throwing away the old ones.

Step 3: John bought 13 new socks.
Now, we add the 13 new socks to the 14 socks John had left:

14 + 13 = 27

Step 4: Calculate the total number of socks John has now.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of players on the team.
The school's baseball team has 2 new players and 6 returning players. To find the total number of players, we add these two numbers together:

2 (new players) + 6 (returning players) = 8 players

Step 2: Determine the number of players in each group.
The coach wants to put the players into groups with 4 players in each group.

Step 3: Divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.
To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of players (8) by the number of players in each group (4):

8 ÷ 4 = 2

Step 4: Check the result.
Since we divided the total number of players (8) by the number of players in each group (4), we can conclude that there will be 2 groups.

* The painter needs to paint 6 rooms.
* Each room takes 5 hours to paint.
* He has already painted 2 rooms.

Step 2: Calculate the total time it takes to paint all 6 rooms.
* Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the total time to paint all 6 rooms is:
6 rooms x 5 hours/room = 30 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time it took to paint the 2 rooms he has already finished.
* Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the time it took to paint the 2 rooms is:
2 rooms x 5 hours/room = 10 hours

Step 4: Calculate the time remaining to paint the rest of the rooms.
* The painter has already painted 2 rooms, which took 10 hours. To paint the remaining 4 rooms, he needs to spend:

                    question:
                     Bianca picked 39 tulips and 49 roses to make flower bouquets. If she only used 81 of the flowers though, how many extra flowers did Bianca pick?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of flowers Bianca picked.
Bianca picked 39 tulips and 49 roses, so we need to add these numbers together to get the total number of flowers:
39 (tulips) + 49 (roses) = 88

Step 2: Identify the number of flowers Bianca used.
Bianca used a total of 81 flowers.

Step 3: Subtract the number of flowers used from the total number of flowers picked.
To find the number of extra flowers Bianca picked, we need to subtract the number of flowers used from the total number of flowers picked:
88 (total flowers) - 81 (flowers used) = 7

Step 4: Interpret the result.
The result of 7 indicates that Bianca picked 7 extra flowers beyond what she used.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of shirts Dave had to wash.
Dave had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts. To find the total number of shirts, we add these two numbers together:

9 (short sleeve) + 27 (long sleeve) = 36 shirts

Step 2: Identify the number of shirts Dave had washed by the time school started.
Dave had washed 20 shirts by the time school started.

Step 3: Find the number of shirts Dave did not wash.
To find the number of shirts Dave did not wash, we subtract the number of shirts he had washed (20) from the total number of shirts he had to wash (36):

36 (total shirts) - 20 (shirts washed) = 16 shirts

Step 4: Check our answer.
We have found that Dave did not wash 16 shirts. Let's double-check by adding the number of shirts he had washed (20) to the number of shirts he did not wash (16):

20 (shirts washed) + 16 (shirts not washed) = 36 shirts

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     For a birthday party Cody bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 6 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sodas Cody has.
Cody has 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas, so the total number of sodas is:
4 (regular sodas) + 44 (diet sodas) = 48 sodas

Step 2: Determine how many sodas can fit on each shelf.
Cody's fridge can hold 6 sodas on each shelf.

Step 3: Calculate how many shelves Cody can fill with regular sodas.
Since Cody has 4 regular sodas, he can fit them on:
4 regular sodas ÷ 6 sodas per shelf = 0.67 shelves (round down to 0 shelves, since you can't have a fraction of a shelf)

Step 4: Calculate how many shelves Cody can fill with diet sodas.
Cody has 44 diet sodas, and he can fit them on:
44 diet sodas ÷ 6 sodas per shelf = 7.33 shelves (round down to 7 shelves, since you can't have a fraction of a shelf)

Step 5: Add the number of shelves Cody can fill with regular and diet sodas.
Cody can fill 0 shelves with regular sodas and 7 shelves with diet sodas, so:
0 + 7 = 7 shelves

Step 6: Check if Cody has any leftover sodas.
Since Cody has 48 sodas in total and he can fit 42 sodas (7 shelves × 6 sodas per shelf) in his fridge, he has:
48 sodas - 42 sodas = 6 sodas leftover

Step 7: Since Cody has leftover sodas, he will need additional shelves to store them.
Cody will need to store the leftover 6 sodas, which means he will need:
6 sodas ÷ 6 sodas per shelf = 1 additional shelf

Step 8: Add the initial 7 shelves to the additional shelf needed.
Cody will need a total of:
7 shelves + 1 additional shelf = 8 shelves

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the total number of students on the debate team.
We are given that there are 26 boys and 46 girls. To find the total number of students, we add these two numbers together:
26 (boys) + 46 (girls) = 72

Step 2: Determine how many groups of 9 students can be formed.
Since we want to split the students into groups of 9, we need to find out how many times 9 goes into the total number of students (72). We can do this by dividing 72 by 9:
72 ÷ 9 = 8

Step 3: Check if there are any remaining students after forming the groups.
Since we have 72 students and we can form 8 groups of 9 students each, we can calculate the number of remaining students by subtracting the total number of students in the groups from the total number of students:
72 - (8 × 9) = 72 - 72 = 0

There are no remaining students, which means that we have formed the maximum number of groups possible.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial order
The school cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples, so in total they ordered:

6 (red apples) + 15 (green apples) = 21 apples

Step 2: Determine the number of apples needed for 5 students
Since 5 students wanted fruit, and each student wants one piece of fruit, the cafeteria needs:

5 (students) x 1 (apple per student) = 5 apples

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples remaining after fulfilling the students' requests
The cafeteria has 21 apples initially, and they need 5 apples to fulfill the students' requests. To find out how many apples are left over, subtract the number of apples needed from the initial order:

21 (initial apples) - 5 (apples needed) = 16 apples

Step 4: Identify the extra apples
Since the cafeteria has 16 apples left over, and they initially ordered 21 apples, they have:

16 (apples remaining) - 21 (initial apples) = -5 apples

Wait, what? We can't have a negative number of apples! This means that the cafeteria actually has fewer apples than they initially ordered. To find the number of extra apples, we need to calculate the difference between the initial order and the number of apples needed:

21 (initial apples) - 5 (apples needed) = 16 apples

So, the cafeteria has 16 apples left over, which is fewer than they initially ordered. To find the number of extra apples, we subtract the number of apples needed from the initial order:

21 (initial apples) - 5 (apples needed) = 16 apples

The cafeteria has 16 apples fewer than they initially ordered, which means they have:

16 (fewer apples) x -1 (since it's a subtraction) = -16 apples

Step 2: Determine how many teams they will split into.
The problem states they will split into 8 teams.

{So, there will be 8 teams.}

Step 3: Calculate the number of people on each team.

Step 3: Subtract the amount spent from the initial amount to find the remaining amount of money.
$42 (initial amount) - $10 (amount spent) = $32

{Remaining amount: $32}

Step 4: Determine how many 8-dollar games Mike can buy with the remaining amount of money.
To find the answer, divide the remaining amount by the cost of each game (8 dollars).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of trays Jerry needs to pick up from each table.
Jerry needs to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another.

Step 2: Determine the total number of trays Jerry needs to pick up.
To find the total number of trays, we add the number of trays from each table: 9 + 7 = 16 trays.

Step 3: Calculate the number of trips Jerry will make.
Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, so to find the number of trips, we divide the total number of trays by 8: 16 ÷ 8 = 2 trips.

However, we need to consider that Jerry still needs to pick up 2 trays (16 - 8 = 2) after making the first 2 trips. Since he can only carry 8 trays at a time, he will need to make one more trip to pick up the remaining 2 trays.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of trips Jerry will make.
Jerry will make 2 trips initially, and then one more trip to pick up the remaining 2 trays. Therefore, the total number of trips is: 2 + 1 = 3 trips.

Faye found 2 treasures on the first level and 6 treasures on the second level.

Step 3: Calculate the total score for each level
For the first level, Faye found 2 treasures, so her score is:
2 treasures x 7 points per treasure = 14 points

For the second level, Faye found 6 treasures, so her score is:
6 treasures x 7 points per treasure = 42 points

Step 4: Add the scores for each level to find the total score

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of players on the team.
There are 12 new players and 44 returning players. To find the total number of players, I add these two numbers together:

12 (new players) + 44 (returning players) = 56 players

Step 2: Determine the number of players in each group.
The coach wants to put the players into groups with 8 players in each group.

Step 3: Divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.
To find the number of groups, I divide the total number of players (56) by the number of players in each group (8):

56 players ÷ 8 players per group = 7 groups

Step 4: Check the result.
I've divided the total number of players by the number of players in each group, and the result is 7. This means that the coach can put the 56 players into 7 groups of 8 players each.

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that the worksheet has 4 problems on it.
We know that the teacher has 16 worksheets to grade.
We know that the teacher has already graded 8 of them.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of problems the teacher has graded so far.
Since the teacher has graded 8 worksheets, and each worksheet has 4 problems, the total number of problems graded so far is:
8 worksheets x 4 problems per worksheet = 32 problems

Step 3: Calculate the total number of problems the teacher still needs to grade.
The teacher has 16 worksheets in total, and has already graded 8 of them. To find the number of worksheets she still needs to grade, we subtract the number of worksheets she's already graded from the total number of worksheets:
16 worksheets - 8 worksheets = 8 worksheets

                     A pet store had 13 puppies. In one day they sold 7 of them and put the rest into cages with 2 in each cage. How many cages did they use?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The pet store had 13 puppies initially.

Step 2: They sold 7 puppies, which means they have:

13 - 7 = 6 puppies left

Step 3: The remaining 6 puppies need to be put into cages with 2 puppies in each cage. To find the number of cages needed, we can divide the number of puppies left (6) by the number of puppies per cage (2):

6 ÷ 2 = 3

Step 4: Since we can fit 2 puppies in each cage, we need 3 cages to accommodate the remaining 6 puppies.

{The final answer is} 3 cages.<|eot_id|>",3

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Faye picked 23 carrots and her mother picked 5 carrots. We also know that only 12 of the carrots are good.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of carrots picked by Faye and her mother.
Faye picked 23 carrots and her mother picked 5 carrots, so the total number of carrots picked is:
23 (Faye's carrots) + 5 (her mother's carrots) = 28 carrots

Step 3: Subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked to find the number of bad carrots.
We know that only 12 carrots are good, so the number of bad carrots is:
28 (total carrots) - 12 (good carrots) = 16 bad carrots

Step 4: The final answer is:
Faye and her mom had 16 bad carrots. {The final answer is}<|eot_id|>",16

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of flowers Isabel had, which is 66.

Step 2: Identify the number of flowers that wilted, which is 10.

Step 3: Subtract the wilted flowers from the initial number of flowers to find the remaining flowers: 66 - 10 = 56

Step 4: Identify the number of flowers needed for each bouquet, which is 8.

Step 5: Divide the remaining flowers (56) by the number of flowers needed for each bouquet (8) to find the number of bouquets Isabel can still make: 56 ÷ 8 = 7

Step 6: Check the calculation to make sure it makes sense. If Isabel had 66 flowers initially, and 10 wilted, she would have 56 left. If she needs 8 flowers for each bouquet, she can make 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Identify the number of times Oliver rode the ferris wheel and the bumper cars.
He rode the ferris wheel 5 times and the bumper cars 4 times.

**Step 2:** Identify the cost of each ride.
Each ride of the ferris wheel and the bumper cars costs 7 tickets.

**Step 3:** Calculate the total number of tickets used for the ferris wheel rides.
Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times, and each ride costs 7 tickets. To find the total number of tickets used, multiply the number of times he rode the ferris wheel by the cost of each ride:
5 rides × 7 tickets per ride = 35 tickets

**Step 4:** Calculate the total number of tickets used for the bumper car rides.
Oliver rode the bumper cars 4 times, and each ride costs 7 tickets. To find the total number of tickets used, multiply the number of times he rode the bumper cars by the cost of each ride:
4 rides × 7 tickets per ride = 28 tickets

Wendy bought 4 new chairs and 4 new tables, so she bought a total of:

4 chairs + 4 tables = 8 pieces of furniture

Step 2: Identify the time it takes to assemble each piece of furniture.
Wendy spends 6 minutes on each piece of furniture, so we need to multiply the number of pieces by the time it takes to assemble each one:

8 pieces x 6 minutes/piece = 48 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to assemble all the furniture.
Since Wendy has to assemble all 8 pieces, we simply add up the time it takes to assemble each one:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Ned bought 50 games from a friend.
Step 2: He bought 27 more games at a garage sale.
Step 3: To find the total number of games Ned bought, we add the number of games he bought from his friend (50) to the number of games he bought at the garage sale (27). This gives us a total of:

50 + 27 = 77

Step 4: Ned ended up with 77 games in total.
Step 5: However, 74 of these games didn't work. To find the number of good games Ned has, we need to subtract the number of non-working games from the total number of games.

77 (total games) - 74 (non-working games) = 3

Step 6: Therefore, Ned has 3 good games.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of cats.
We are told that the pet store had 38 Siamese cats and 25 house cats. To find the total number of cats initially, we add these two numbers together:

38 (Siamese cats) + 25 (house cats) = 63 cats

Step 2: Determine the number of cats sold.
The pet store sold 45 cats during the sale.

Step 3: Subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of cats.
To find the number of cats left, we subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of cats:

63 (initial cats) - 45 (cats sold) =?

Step 4: Perform the subtraction.
63 - 45 = 18

She scored 17 points in the first round and 6 points in the second round, so her total points after the first two rounds are:
17 + 6 = 23

Step 2: Determine the total points Carol had before the last round.
She had 23 points after the first two rounds, so this is her point total before the last round.

Step 3: Determine the points Carol lost in the last round.
She lost 16 points in the last round, so subtracting this from her total points before the last round, we get:
23 - 16 = 7

Step 4: Determine the final point total.
Carol had 7 points left after the last round. {The final answer is} 7.<|eot_id|>",7

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many pieces of chocolate candy Dave had initially.
Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy, and each box has 3 pieces inside. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces per box:

12 boxes × 3 pieces/box = 36 pieces

{So far, we know Dave had 36 pieces of chocolate candy initially.}

Step 2: Determine how many pieces Dave gave away.
Dave gave 5 boxes of chocolate candy to his little brother. Since each box has 3 pieces, we multiply the number of boxes given away by the number of pieces per box:

5 boxes × 3 pieces/box = 15 pieces

{So far, we know Dave gave away 15 pieces of chocolate candy.}

Step 3: Subtract the pieces given away from the initial total.
To find out how many pieces Dave still has, we subtract the number of pieces given away from the initial total:

36 pieces (initial) - 15 pieces (given away) = 21 pieces
