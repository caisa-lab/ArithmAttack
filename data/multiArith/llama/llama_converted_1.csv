                    question:
                     Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Paige has 11 songs initially.

Step 2: She deletes 9 old songs from her mp3 player. To find the number of songs she has left, we subtract 9 from 11:

11 - 9 = 2

So, Paige has 2 songs left on her mp3 player after deleting 9 old songs.

Step 3: Then, she adds 8 new songs to her mp3 player. To find the total number of songs she has now, we add 8 to the 2 songs she had left:

2 + 8 = 10

Step 4: Finally, we need to find the total number of songs Paige has on her mp3 player. Since we've added the 8 new songs to the 2 songs she had left, the total number of songs is:

10

{The final answer is 10 songs.}<|eot_id|>",10,10.0,10.0
