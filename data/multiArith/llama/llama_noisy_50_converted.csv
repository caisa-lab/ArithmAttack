Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Paige had 11 songs initially.

Step 2: She deleted 9 old songs. To find out how many songs she had left, we subtract 9 from 11:

11 - 9 = 2

So, Paige had 2 songs left on her mp3 player after deleting 9 old songs.

Step 3: Then, she added 8 new songs. To find out how many songs she has now, we add the 2 songs she had left to the 8 new songs:

2 + 8 = 10

So, Paige has 10 songs on her mp3 player now.

{The final answer is 10.}<|eot_id|>",10,10.0,10.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of students trying out for the basketball team.
We are given that there were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out. To find the total number of students, we add the number of girls and boys:

39 (girls) + 4 (boys) = 43

Step 2: Determine the number of students who got called back.
We are given that only 26 students got called back. This means that the remaining students did not make the cut.

Step 3: Find the number of students who did not make the cut.
To do this, we subtract the number of students who got called back (26) from the total number of students trying out (43):

43 (total students) - 26 (students who got called back) = 17

Step 4: Write the final answer.
{The final answer is} 17 students did not make the cut.<|eot_id|>",17,17.0,17.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Faye starts with 34 coloring books.

Step 2: She gives away 3 coloring books, which means she has 34 - 3 = 31 coloring books left.

Step 3: She buys 48 more coloring books, which means she adds 48 to the 31 she has left.

Step 4: To find the total number of coloring books Faye has, we add the 31 she had left to the 48 she bought: 31 + 48 =?

Step 5: To calculate the total, we perform the addition: 31 + 48 = 79

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The school cafeteria had 23 apples initially.

Step 2: They used 20 apples to make lunch for the students. To find out how many apples they have left, we need to subtract 20 from the initial 23 apples:

23 - 20 = 3 apples

So, after using 20 apples, the school cafeteria has 3 apples left.

Step 3: Then, they bought 6 more apples. To find out how many apples they have now, we need to add the 6 new apples to the 3 apples they had left:

3 (apples left) + 6 (new apples) = 9 apples

Step 4: Therefore, after buying 6 more apples, the school cafeteria would have a total of 9 apples.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of enemies defeated
The problem states that you destroy all but 3 of the 11 enemies in the level. To find the number of enemies defeated, subtract 3 from 11:

11 (total enemies) - 3 (enemies left) = 8

So, 8 enemies are defeated.

Step 2: Calculate the points earned
Each enemy defeated gives you 9 points. To find the total points earned, multiply the number of enemies defeated by 9:

8 (enemies defeated) × 9 (points per enemy) = 72

Step 3: Write the final answer

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of bags Megan recycled.
Megan had 14 bags, but didn't recycle 5 of them. To find the number of bags she recycled, we need to subtract 5 from 14.

14 (total bags) - 5 (bags not recycled) = 9

So, Megan recycled 9 bags.

Step 2: Determine the points earned per bag.
Megan earns 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled. This is a constant rate, so we can multiply the number of bags recycled by 8 to find the total points earned.

Step 3: Calculate the total points earned.
Megan recycled 9 bags, and each bag earns her 8 points. To find the total points earned, we multiply 9 (bags recycled) by 8 (points per bag).

9 (bags) x 8 (points per bag) = 72

So, Megan earned a total of 72 points.

Step 2: Determine the price of each rose
Each rose was sold for $4.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount earned from selling roses
April sold 9 roses at $4 each. To find the total amount earned, multiply the number of roses sold by the price of each rose:

9 roses × $4/rose = $36

Step 4: Determine the amount of money earned

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts before school.

Step 2: Determine the total number of shirts Ned had to wash.
To do this, we add the number of short sleeve shirts (9) to the number of long sleeve shirts (21).
9 + 21 = 30

Step 3: Identify the number of shirts Ned washed before school started.
According to the problem, Ned washed 29 shirts before school started.

Step 4: Determine the number of shirts Ned did not wash.
To find this out, we subtract the number of shirts Ned washed (29) from the total number of shirts he had to wash (30).

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the number of people who actually showed up to the luncheon.
The problem states that 7 people didn't show up, so we need to subtract 7 from the original 47 invited people.

47 (invited) - 7 (didn't show up) = 40 people showed up

Step 2: Determine the number of tables needed based on the capacity of each table.
Each table can hold 5 people, so we need to divide the number of people who showed up by 5 to find the number of tables needed.

40 people ÷ 5 people per table = 8 tables

Step 3: Since we can't have a fraction of a table, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure everyone has a seat.

{The final answer is 8 tables.}<|eot_id|>",8,8.0,8.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Tom had 5 books initially.

Step 2: He sold 4 ""of them"". This implies that he sold a certain number of books, but the exact number is not specified. We can represent this as a variable, let's say ""x"".

Step 3: He used the money he earned from selling the books to buy 38 new books. This means that he added 38 new books to his collection.

Step 4: To find out how many books Tom has now, we need to subtract the number of books he sold (x) from the initial number of books he had (5), and then add the number of new books he bought (38).

Step 5: Let's represent the number of books Tom has now as ""y"". We can write an equation to represent the situation:

y = 5 - x + 38

Step 6: To solve for y, we need to simplify the equation. First, we can combine the constants:

y = 43 - x

Step 7: The problem doesn't specify the exact number of books Tom sold, so we can't find the exact value of y. However, we can express the final answer in terms of the variable x.

Step 8: The final answer is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sodas Jerry bought.

Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. To find the total number of sodas, we add these two numbers together:

41 (regular sodas) + 22 (diet sodas) = 63 sodas

Step 2: Determine how many sodas will fit on each shelf.

Jerry's fridge can hold 9 sodas on each shelf.

Step 3: Divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

To find out how many shelves Jerry's fridge can fill, we divide the total number of sodas (63) by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf (9):

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Mike is at the library helping put away books.
* There are 82 books in total.
* A librarian takes 10 books and leaves the rest for Mike.
* Mike can fit 9 books on a shelf.

Step 2: Calculate the number of books left for Mike after the librarian takes 10 books.

* The librarian takes 10 books, so Mike is left with:
82 (total books) - 10 (books taken) = 72 books

Step 3: Calculate the number of shelves Mike will need to put away the remaining books.

* Since Mike can fit 9 books on a shelf, we need to divide the number of books left for him (72) by 9 to find the number of shelves needed:
72 (books left) ÷ 9 (books per shelf) = 8 shelves

                    . A. store had 40 oranges! in a bin. If they threw. away! 25! of the old. ones and. put 21 new ones in the bin how many would. be in the ; bin?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The store had 40 oranges initially.

Step 2: They threw away 25 old oranges. To find the number of oranges left, we subtract 25 from 40:

40 - 25 = 15

So, there are 15 oranges left in the bin.

Step 3: The store put 21 new oranges in the bin. To find the total number of oranges in the bin, we add the 15 left oranges to the 21 new oranges:

15 + 21 = 36

Step 4: Therefore, there are 36 oranges in the bin after the store threw away the old ones and added new ones.

{The final answer is 36 oranges.}<|eot_id|>",36,36.0,36.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
The waiter had 7 customers. 5 of them didn't leave a tip.

Step 2: Calculate the number of customers who left a tip
If 5 customers didn't leave a tip, that means the remaining customers did leave a tip. To find the number of customers who left a tip, subtract 5 from the total number of customers:

7 (total customers) - 5 (customers who didn't leave a tip) = 2

So, 2 customers left a tip.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount earned from the customers who left a tip
Each customer who left a tip gave $3. To find the total amount earned, multiply the number of customers who left a tip by the amount each gave:

2 (customers who left a tip) × $3 (per customer) = $6

Step 4: Calculate the total amount earned
The waiter earned $6 from the customers who left a tip.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of chicken wings cooked initially by the chef.
The problem states that the chef had 9 chicken wings cooked initially.

Step 2: Identify the number of chicken wings cooked additionally for the group.
The problem states that the chef cooked 7 more chicken wings for the group.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of chicken wings cooked.
To find the total number of chicken wings, we add the initial 9 wings to the additional 7 wings cooked for the group.
9 + 7 = 16

Step 4: Identify the number of people in the group.
The problem states that there are 4 friends in the group.

Step 5: Calculate the number of chicken wings each person would get.
To find the number of wings each person would get, we divide the total number of wings (16) by the number of people in the group (4).
16 ÷ 4 = 4

Step 6: Verify that each person gets the same amount.
Since we divided the total number of wings by the number of people, we can confirm that each person would get the same amount, which is 4 wings.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Wendy uploaded 79 pictures to Facebook. She put 44 pictures into one album.

* We know that 44 pictures are in one album. This means that 79 - 44 =? pictures are left.

Step 2: Wendy put the rest of the pictures into 5 different albums.

* The ""rest"" refers to the pictures that are not in the first album. We know that 79 - 44 =? pictures are left. To find out how many pictures are left, we subtract 44 from 79:

79 - 44 = 35

* So, there are 35 pictures left.

Step 3: These 35 pictures are divided into 5 different albums.

* To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures left (35) by the number of albums (5):

35 ÷ 5 = 7

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of team members.
The team has 5 boys and 40 girls, so the total number of team members is:

Step 2: Determine the number of members in each group.
The problem states that the team members are to be split into groups of 9. Let's call the number of groups ""x"".

Step 3: Write an equation to represent the situation.
Since each group has 9 members, the total number of members in all groups should equal the total number of team members (45). We can write an equation:
9x = 45

Step 4: Solve the equation for x.
To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:
x = 45 ÷ 9
x = 5

Step 5: Interpret the result.
The result shows that the team can be split into 5 groups of 9 members each.

We know that each rose was $7, and April started with 9 roses. We also know that she had 4 roses left after the sale.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount April spent on roses.
Since April started with 9 roses and had 4 roses left, she must have sold 9 - 4 = 5 roses.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount April earned from selling the roses.
Since each rose was $7, and she sold 5 roses, the total amount she earned is:
5 roses x $7 per rose = $35

Step 4: Determine the amount of money April earned.
Since April started with 9 roses and had 4 roses left, she must have earned the total amount she sold (5 roses) minus the cost of the roses she didn't sell (5 roses).

Step 5: Calculate the amount of money April earned.
$35 (total earned from selling 5 roses) - $35 (cost of 5 unsold roses) = $0

Step 6: Determine the final answer.
April did not earn any money from the sale, since she spent the same amount she earned on the unsold roses.

{The final answer is $0}<|eot_id|>",35,35.0,0.0

Todd ate 43 cupcakes.

Step 3: Subtract the number of cupcakes Todd ate from the initial number of cupcakes Megan baked.
To find out how many cupcakes are left, subtract the number of cupcakes Todd ate from the initial number:
71 (initial cupcakes) - 43 (cupcakes Todd ate) = 28 cupcakes

Step 4: Determine how many packages Megan can make with the remaining cupcakes.
Megan wants to put 7 cupcakes in each package. To find out how many packages she can make, divide the remaining number of cupcakes by 7:

To find the total number of players, we add the initial 2 friends to the 2 new players:
2 (initial friends) + 2 (new players) = 4 players

Step 4: Determine the number of lives each player has.
The problem states that each player has 6 lives.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of lives.
Since there are 4 players, and each player has 6 lives, we multiply the number of players by the number of lives each player has:

Step 2: He throws away 3 old socks that didn't fit. To find the number of socks he has left, we subtract the number of socks he threw away from the original number:

10 (initial socks) - 3 (socks thrown away) = 7

So, Sam has 7 socks left.

Step 3: He buys 36 new socks. To find the total number of socks he has now, we add the number of new socks to the number of socks he had left:

7 (socks left) + 36 (new socks) = 43

Step 4: We add the new socks to the socks he had left, giving us the total number of socks Sam has now.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Wendy picked 103 flowers for her friend's wedding.

Step 2: She was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. To find the total number of bouquets she could make, we need to divide the total number of flowers (103) by the number of flowers in each bouquet (8).

103 ÷ 8 = 12.875 (round down to 12, since you can't make a fraction of a bouquet)

Step 3: 47 of the flowers wilted before the wedding. To find the number of flowers left, we subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers:

103 - 47 = 56

Step 4: Now we need to make bouquets with the remaining flowers. Since each bouquet requires 8 flowers, we divide the number of remaining flowers (56) by 8:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Step 5: Therefore, Wendy can still make 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Adam initially had 48 books.

Step 2: He sold 19/100 of his books. To find out how many books he sold, we need to find 19% of 48.

To do this, we can convert 19% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 19 ÷ 100 = 0.19

Then, we multiply 0.19 by 48: 0.19 × 48 = 9.12

Since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we'll round down to the nearest whole number: 9 books.

Step 3: Adam used the money he earned from selling the books to buy 38 new books.

Step 4: To find out how many books Adam has now, we need to subtract the books he sold (9) from the initial number of books he had (48), and then add the new books he bought (38).

48 - 9 = 39 (books he has left after selling)

39 + 38 = 77 (total books he has now)

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of people going on the field trip.
We know there are 12 students and 3 adults going. To find the total number of people, we add these numbers together:

12 students + 3 adults = 15 people

Step 2: Determine the capacity of each van.
We know that each van can hold 5 people.

Step 3: Divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van.
To find out how many vans they will need, we divide the total number of people (15) by the capacity of each van (5):

15 people ÷ 5 people/van = 3 vans

Step 4: Check if there are any remaining people.
Since we've divided the total number of people by the capacity of each van, we need to check if there are any remaining people. In this case, we're left with no people (because we've divided the total number of people by the capacity of each van).

{The final answer is} 3 vans.<|eot_id|>",3,3.0,3.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of sodas Tom has.
Tom has 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. To find the total number of sodas, we add these two numbers together:

4 (regular sodas) + 52 (diet sodas) = 56 sodas

Step 2: Determine how many sodas can fit on each shelf.
The fridge can hold 7 sodas on each shelf.

Step 3: Divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.
To find out how many shelves Tom would need to fill up, we divide the total number of sodas (56) by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf (7):

56 ÷ 7 = 8

Step 4: Round up to the nearest whole number, if necessary.
Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, 8 is already a whole number, so we don't need to round.

* From one table, Luke needs to pick up 20 trays.
* From another table, Luke needs to pick up 16 trays.

Step 2: Determine the total number of trays Luke needs to pick up.

* Total trays = 20 (from one table) + 16 (from another table) = 36 trays

Step 3: Since Luke can only carry 4 trays at a time, calculate the number of trips he'll need to make to pick up all the trays.

* To find the number of trips, divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Luke can carry per trip.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Determine the number of apples handed out to students
The cafeteria handed out 42 apples to students.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining apples after handing out to students
The cafeteria had 96 apples initially. After handing out 42 apples, the remaining number of apples can be calculated as:

96 - 42 = 54 apples remaining

Step 3: Determine the number of apples needed to make pies
Each pie takes 6 apples. To find out how many pies can be made, we need to divide the remaining apples by 6:

54 apples remaining ÷ 6 apples per pie = 9 pies

Step 4: Confirm the answer
The cafeteria can make 9 pies using the remaining apples.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Tiffany baked 8 brownies, but she needs a total of 17 brownies for her party. This means she is still short 17 - 8 = 9 brownies.

Step 2: Since Tiffany needs 9 more brownies, she will need to make 9 more batches of brownies using the same recipe. Each batch requires 8 cups of flour, so she will need 9 x 8 = 72 cups of flour for the remaining brownies.

Step 3: Tiffany already used 8 cups of flour for each of the 8 brownies she baked, which means she used a total of 8 x 8 = 64 cups of flour.

Step 4: To find out how much flour she still needs, we subtract the amount of flour she already used (64 cups) from the total amount of flour she needs for the remaining brownies (72 cups). This gives us:

72 cups - 64 cups = 8 cups

{The final answer is 8 cups of flour.}<|eot_id|>",72,72.0,8.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Carol and her mom were picking carrots from their garden.
* Carol picked 29 carrots.
* Her mother picked 16 carrots.
* Only 38% of the carrots were good.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of carrots picked by Carol and her mom.

* Carol picked 29 carrots.
* Her mother picked 16 carrots.
* Total number of carrots = 29 + 16 = 45 carrots.

Step 3: Calculate the number of good carrots.

* Since only 38% of the carrots are good, we need to calculate 38% of the total number of carrots.
* To do this, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 38% = 0.38.
* Then, we can multiply the total number of carrots by this decimal: 0.38 x 45 = 17.1.
* Since we can't have a fraction of a carrot, we'll round down to the nearest whole number: 17 good carrots.

Step 4: Calculate the number of bad carrots.

* Since there are a total of 45 carrots, and 17 are good, the number of bad carrots is:
* 45 (total carrots) - 17 (good carrots) = 28 bad carrots.

{The final answer is 28 bad carrots.}<|eot_id|>",7,7.0,28.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of problems the teacher has to grade.
The teacher has 17 worksheets to grade, and she has already graded 8 of them. To find the number of problems she has to grade, we need to subtract the number of problems she has already graded from the total number of worksheets.

17 worksheets - 8 worksheets =?

Step 2: Perform the subtraction.
17 - 8 = 9

So, the teacher has 9 worksheets left to grade.

Step 3: Identify the number of problems on each worksheet.
Each worksheet has 7 problems, as stated in the problem.

Step 4: Multiply the number of worksheets left to grade by the number of problems on each worksheet.
To find the total number of problems the teacher has to grade, we multiply the number of worksheets left to grade (9) by the number of problems on each worksheet (7).

There were 8 friends playing the game initially.

Step 2: Determine how many more players joined the game.
2 more players joined the game, making a total of:

8 (initial players) + 2 (new players) = 10 players

Step 3: Calculate the total number of lives each player has.
Each player has 6 lives, so the total number of lives for each player is:

6 lives per player

Step 4: Calculate the total number of lives for all players.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Cody initially won 49 tickets.

Step 2: He spent 25 tickets on a beanie. To find out how many tickets he has left, we subtract the number of tickets he spent from the initial number of tickets he won:

49 - 25 = 24

So, Cody has 24 tickets left.

Step 3: He later won 6 more tickets. To find out how many tickets he has now, we add the 6 new tickets to the 24 tickets he had left:

24 + 6 = 30

Therefore, Cody has a total of 30 tickets.

78 (initial pieces) - 30 (pieces eaten) = 48 pieces left

Step 2: Bianca placed the remaining 48 pieces into piles with 8 pieces in each pile. To find the number of piles, we need to divide the number of remaining pieces (48) by the number of pieces in each pile (8).

48 ÷ 8 = 6

Step 3: Since 48 divided by 8 leaves no remainder, Bianca can make 6 piles with 8 pieces in each pile.

The cost of an adult meal is $8.

Step 2: Identify the number of adult meals
There are 11 people in the group, and 2 of them are kids. This means that 9 people are adults.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the adult meals
Since 9 people are adults, they will eat 9 adult meals. The cost of these meals is:
9 x $8 = $72

Step 4: Identify the cost of the kid's meals
Since the kids eat for free, the cost of their meals is $0.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost

Here's the step-by-step solution to the problem:

Step 1: Roger had 25 books initially.
Let's denote the number of books Roger had initially as x, where x = 25.

Step 2: He sold 21 of them.
This means Roger sold 21 books, which reduces the number of books he had by 21. To find the new number of books Roger has, we subtract 21 from the initial number:

x - 21 =?

Step 3: We need to find the new number of books Roger has after selling 21 books.
Let's denote the new number of books Roger has as y. We can set up the equation:

y = x - 21
y = 25 - 21
y = 4

Step 4: Roger used the money he earned to buy 30 new books.
This means Roger now has 4 books (from Step 3) and 30 new books he bought. To find the total number of books Roger has now, we add the number of books he had initially (4) to the number of new books he bought (30):

Total number of books = 4 + 30
Total number of books = 34

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Wendy had 10 lives initially.

Step 2: She lost 6 lives in a hard part of the game.

To find out how many lives she has left, we need to subtract the lives she lost from the initial number of lives:

10 (initial lives) - 6 (lives lost) = 4

So, Wendy has 4 lives left.

Step 3: She got 37 more lives in the next level.

To find out how many lives she has now, we need to add the new lives to the number of lives she had left:

The school's baseball team has 48 new players and 6 returning players. To find the total number of players, we add these two numbers together:

48 (new players) + 6 (returning players) = 54 players

Step 2: Determine the number of players in each group
The coach wants to put the players into groups with 6 players in each group.

Step 3: Divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group
To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of players (54) by the number of players in each group (6):

54 players ÷ 6 players/group = 9 groups

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Isabel uploaded 25 pictures to Facebook. We know that she put 10 pictures into one album, so we need to subtract 10 from 25 to find out how many pictures are left.

25 (total pictures) - 10 (pictures in one album) = 15

Step 2: Isabel put the rest of the pictures (15) into 5 different albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we need to divide 15 by 5.

15 (pictures left) ÷ 5 (number of albums) = 3

Step 3: We know that Isabel put 10 pictures into one album. Since we've already calculated that each of the other 5 albums has 3 pictures, we can add 3 to 10 to find the total number of pictures in the first album.

10 (pictures in one album) + 3 (pictures in each of the other albums) = 13

Step 4: Since we've already calculated that each of the other 5 albums has 3 pictures, we can conclude that:

                    question:
                     Vanessa had 16 music files and 48 video files on her flash drive. If she deleted 30? of the files, how many files, were? still on, her flash drive?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of files Vanessa had initially.
Vanessa had 16 music files and 48 video files, so the total number of files is:
16 (music files) + 48 (video files) = 64 files

Step 2: Determine the percentage of files to be deleted.
The problem states that Vanessa deleted 30% of the files. To find the actual number of files to be deleted, we need to calculate 30% of the total number of files:
30% of 64 files = 0.30 x 64 = 19.2 files

Step 3: Round the result to the nearest whole number.
Since we can't delete a fraction of a file, we round the result to the nearest whole number:
19.2 files → 19 files

Step 4: Delete the calculated number of files from the total.
Vanessa had 64 files initially, and she deleted 19 files. To find the remaining files, we subtract the number of deleted files from the total:
64 files - 19 files = 45 files

Step 5: The final answer is:
{The final answer is 45 files.}<|eot_id|>",34,34.0,45.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The florist had 50 roses initially.

Step 2: She sold 15% of them. To find 15% of 50, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 15 ÷ 100 = 0.15. Then, multiply 0.15 by 50 to get the number of roses sold: 0.15 × 50 = 7.5. Since you can't sell a fraction of a rose, we'll round down to 7 roses sold.

Step 3: The florist had 50 - 7 = 43 roses left after selling 7.

Step 4: She picked 21 more roses. To find the total number of roses she now has, add the number of roses she had left (43) to the number of new roses she picked (21): 43 + 21 = 64.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Kaleb had 12 dollars initially.

Step 2: He spent 8 bucks on a new game. To find out how much money he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount:

12 dollars - 8 bucks =?

To subtract the dollars and cents correctly, we need to convert the bucks to dollars and cents. Since there are 100 cents in 1 dollar, 8 bucks is equal to:

8 bucks = 8 x 100 cents = 800 cents

Now, we can convert the cents to dollars and cents:

800 cents = 8 dollars and 0 cents

So, Kaleb spent 8 dollars on the game.

Step 3: To find out how much money Kaleb has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount:

12 dollars - 8 dollars = 4 dollars

Kaleb has 4 dollars left.

Step 4: The problem asks how many 2-dollar toys Kaleb can buy with the money he has left. To find the answer, we divide the amount of money he has left (4 dollars) by the cost of each toy (2 dollars):

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Adam had 33 books initially.

Step 2: He sold 11 books, which means he has fewer books now than he did initially. To find out how many books he has left, we subtract the number of books he sold from the initial number:

33 (initial books) - 11 (books sold) = 22

So, Adam has 22 books left.

Step 3: Adam used the money he earned from selling the books to buy 23 new books.

Step 4: To find out how many books Adam has now, we add the number of books he has left (22) to the number of new books he bought (23):

22 (books left) + 23 (new books) = 45

Therefore, {The final answer is} 45 books.<|eot_id|>",45,45.0,45.0

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
Kaleb collected cans on Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday, he filled 5 bags. On Sunday, he filled 5 more bags.

Step 2: Determine the number of cans in each bag.
Each bag has 4 cans.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cans collected on Saturday.
Kaleb filled 5 bags on Saturday. Since each bag has 4 cans, the total number of cans collected on Saturday is:
5 bags x 4 cans/bag = 20 cans

Step 4: Calculate the total number of cans collected on Sunday.
Kaleb filled 5 more bags on Sunday. Since each bag has 4 cans, the total number of cans collected on Sunday is:
5 bags x 4 cans/bag = 20 cans

Step 5: Add the total number of cans collected on Saturday and Sunday.
To find the total number of cans collected, add the number of cans collected on Saturday (20) to the number of cans collected on Sunday (20):
20 cans + 20 cans = 40 cans

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Nancy has:
* 2 shelves of mystery books
* 6 shelves of picture books

Step 2: Determine how many books are on each shelf.
We know that each shelf has exactly 6 books.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of books on the mystery book shelves.
Since there are 2 shelves of mystery books, and each shelf has 6 books, the total number of books on the mystery book shelves is:
2 shelves x 6 books/shelf = 12 books

Step 4: Calculate the total number of books on the picture book shelves.
Since there are 6 shelves of picture books, and each shelf has 6 books, the total number of books on the picture book shelves is:
6 shelves x 6 books/shelf = 36 books

Step 5: Add the total number of books on the mystery book shelves and the picture book shelves to find the total number of books Nancy has.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Paul had saved up 3 dollars initially.

Step 2: He received an additional 7 dollars for his allowance.

Step 3: To find the total amount of money Paul has now, we add the initial amount (3 dollars) to the additional amount (7 dollars):

3 dollars + 7 dollars = 10 dollars

Step 4: The problem asks how many 5-dollar toys Paul can buy. To find the answer, we need to divide the total amount of money Paul has (10 dollars) by the cost of each toy (5 dollars):

10 dollars ÷ 5 dollars = 2

Step 5: Therefore, Paul can buy 2 toys that cost 5 dollars each.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Wendy had 43 lives initially.

Step 2: She lost 8 lives in a hard part of the game.

To find out how many lives she has left, we subtract the number of lives she lost (8) from the initial number of lives (43):

43 - 8 = 35

So, Wendy has 35 lives left after losing 8.

Step 3: She gets 39 more lives in the next level.

To find out how many lives she has in total, we add the number of new lives she gets (39) to the number of lives she has left (35):

35 + 39 = 74

So, Wendy now has a total of 74 lives.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Haley bought 3 tickets for herself.
Let's calculate the cost of these 3 tickets:
3 tickets × $4 per ticket = $12

Step 2: Haley also bought tickets for her friends. The problem doesn't specify how many friends she bought tickets for, so we'll represent this unknown number as ""x"".
Haley bought x tickets for her friends.

Step 3: The problem also mentions that Haley bought 5 extra tickets ""in case anyone else wanted to go"". This means she's buying these extra tickets in addition to the 3 tickets she bought for herself and the x tickets she bought for her friends.

Step 4: To find the total number of tickets Haley bought, we add the 3 tickets she bought for herself, the x tickets she bought for her friends, and the 5 extra tickets:
Total tickets = 3 (for herself) + x (for friends) + 5 (extra) = x + 8

Step 5: Now, we need to calculate the total cost of all these tickets. Since each ticket costs $4, we multiply the total number of tickets (x + 8) by $4:
Total cost = (x + 8) × $4 = $4x + $16

Step 6: The problem asks how much Haley spent, which is the total cost of all the tickets. So, we can conclude that Haley spent $4x + $16.

* Rachel took 6 pictures at the zoo.
* Rachel took 9 pictures at the museum.

Step 2: Combine the number of pictures taken at the zoo and the museum.

* Total number of pictures taken = 6 (at the zoo) + 9 (at the museum) = 15

Step 3: Determine which pictures Rachel deleted.

* Rachel deleted 11 pictures. The question does not specify which pictures she deleted, so we'll assume she deleted a combination of pictures from the zoo and the museum.

Step 4: Subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures taken.

* Total number of pictures taken = 15
* Number of deleted pictures = 11
* Number of pictures remaining = 15 - 11 = 4

Step 5: Determine which type of pictures Rachel has remaining.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of cookies Maria has.
Maria has 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies.
To find the total number of cookies, I add these two numbers together:
5 + 19 = 24

Step 2: Determine the number of cookies that can fit in each baggie.
Maria can fit 8 cookies in each baggie.

Step 3: Divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies that can fit in each baggie.
To find out how many baggies Maria can make, I divide the total number of cookies (24) by the number of cookies that can fit in each baggie (8):
24 ÷ 8 = 3

Step 4: Check if there are any leftover cookies.
Since Maria has 24 cookies and she can fit 8 cookies in each baggie, she can make 3 baggies. To find out if there are any leftover cookies, I subtract the total number of cookies that can fit in the baggies (3 x 8 = 24) from the total number of cookies:
24 - 24 = 0

There are no leftover cookies, so Maria can make exactly 3 baggies.

{The final answer is} 3 baggies.<|eot_id|>",3,3.0,3.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of shelves for each type of book.
We know Bianca has 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books.

Step 2: Determine the number of books on each shelf.
We know each shelf has exactly 8 books.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of books on the mystery book shelves.
Since there are 5 shelves of mystery books, and each shelf has 8 books, we can multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf:
5 shelves x 8 books/shelf = 40 mystery books

Step 4: Calculate the total number of books on the picture book shelves.
Since there are 4 shelves of picture books, and each shelf has 8 books, we can multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf:
4 shelves x 8 books/shelf = 32 picture books

Step 5: Add the total number of mystery books and picture books to find the total number of books.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many new cards John has.
He has 8 new cards.

Step 2: Determine how many old cards John has.
He has 16 old cards.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cards John has.
He has 8 new cards + 16 old cards = 24 cards in total.

Step 4: Since each page can hold 3 cards, calculate how many pages John can fill with his cards.
24 cards ÷ 3 cards per page = 8 pages

Step 5: Since John has 8 new cards, he won't use a full page for those. He'll use a partial page for the remaining cards.
8 new cards - 3 cards per page = 5 remaining cards

Step 6: Calculate how many partial pages John needs to fill the remaining cards.
5 remaining cards ÷ 3 cards per page = 1.67 pages (round up to 2 pages, since you can't have a fraction of a page)

Step 7: Add the full pages (8) to the partial pages (2) to get the total number of pages John needs.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of brownies Isabel baked.
Isabel baked 3 brownies.

Step 2: Identify the total number of brownies needed for her party.
Isabel needs 5 brownies for her party.

Step 3: Determine how many cups of flour were used for each brownie.
Isabel used 5 cups of flour for each brownie.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of flour used for the 3 brownies.
Since Isabel used 5 cups of flour for each brownie, the total amount of flour used for the 3 brownies is:
3 brownies x 5 cups/brownie = 15 cups

Step 5: Determine how much flour Isabel still needs.
Since Isabel needs 5 brownies in total, and she already used 15 cups of flour for the 3 brownies, she still needs:
5 total brownies - 3 brownies already made = 2 brownies
For the 2 remaining brownies, she will need:
2 brownies x 5 cups/brownie = 10 cups

Step 6: Add the remaining flour needed to the total amount of flour used.
To find the total amount of flour Isabel still needs, we add the remaining flour needed to the total amount of flour used:
10 cups (remaining flour needed) + 15 cups (total flour used) = 25 cups

{The final answer is} Isabel still needs 25 cups of flour.<|eot_id|>",10,10.0,25.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair. He spent 28 tickets at the ""dunk, a clown booth"" and decided to use the rest on rides.

Step 2: Calculate the number of tickets Tom has left
Tom started with 40 tickets and spent 28 tickets. To find out how many tickets he has left, we subtract the number of tickets he spent from the total number of tickets:

40 (initial tickets) - 28 (tickets spent) = 12 tickets

Step 3: Determine how many rides Tom can go on
Each ride costs 4 tickets. To find out how many rides Tom can go on, we divide the number of tickets he has left (12) by the number of tickets each ride costs (4):

12 tickets ÷ 4 tickets per ride = 3 rides

31 - 5 = 26

So, there are 26 students remaining in fourth grade.

Step 3: 11 new students came to the school during the year. To find the new total number of students, add the 11 new students to the remaining 26 students:

26 + 11 = 37

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that Bianca and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled, they earned 1 point. We need to find out how many points they earned.

Step 2: Identify the variables
Let's identify the variables:

* Bianca's recycling amount: 24 pounds
* Her friends' recycling amount: 3 pounds
* Total points earned: unknown

Step 3: Calculate the points earned by Bianca
Since Bianca recycled 24 pounds, and they earn 1 point for every 3 pounds recycled, we can calculate her points earned as follows:

24 pounds (recycled by Bianca) ÷ 3 pounds (per point) = 8 points

So, Bianca earned 8 points.

Step 4: Calculate the points earned by her friends
Her friends recycled 3 pounds, and they earn 1 point for every 3 pounds recycled, so:

3 pounds (recycled by friends) ÷ 3 pounds (per point) = 1 point

So, her friends earned 1 point.

Step 5: Calculate the total points earned

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The chef had 8 chicken wings already cooked.
* The chef cooked 10 more chicken wings for the group.
* The group consists of 3 friends.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of chicken wings

* The chef had 8 wings initially.
* The chef cooked 10 more wings, so the total number of wings is: 8 + 10 = 18 wings

Step 3: Determine how many wings each person will get

* Since the group consists of 3 friends, we need to divide the total number of wings by 3 to find out how many wings each person will get.

Step 4: Perform the division

* 18 wings ÷ 3 friends = 6 wings per friend

The final answer is: Each person would get 6 chicken wings.<|eot_id|>",6,6.0,6.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: John initially has 33 socks.

Step 2: He throws away 19 old socks that didn't fit. To find the number of socks he has left, we subtract 19 from 33:

33 - 19 = 14

So, John has 14 socks left after throwing away the old ones.

Step 3: He buys 13 new socks. To find the total number of socks he now has, we add the 14 socks he had left to the 13 new socks:

14 + 13 = 27

Step 4: John now has a total of 27 socks.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of players on the team.
The team has 2 new players and 6 returning players, so the total number of players is:
2 (new players) + 6 (returning players) = 8 players

Step 2: Determine the number of groups with 4 players each.
To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players (8) by the number of players in each group (4).

8 players ÷ 4 players/group = 2 groups

Step 3: Check if there are any remaining players.
Since we have 2 groups with 4 players each, we've used up 2 × 4 = 8 players. This leaves us with:
8 total players - 8 used players = 0 remaining players

Step 4: Verify that all players are accounted for.
We've used up all 8 players, which means we've accounted for every player on the team.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
* A painter needs to paint 6 rooms in a building.
* Each room takes 5 hours to paint.
* The painter has already painted 2 rooms.

Step 2: Calculate the total time taken to paint the 2 rooms that are already done
* The painter has already painted 2 rooms, and each room takes 5 hours to paint.
* To find the total time taken, multiply the number of rooms by the time taken to paint each room: 2 rooms x 5 hours/room = 10 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total time remaining to paint the rest of the rooms
* The painter needs to paint 6 rooms in total, but has already painted 2 rooms.
* To find the total time remaining, subtract the time taken to paint the 2 rooms that are already done from the total time needed to paint all 6 rooms: 6 rooms x 5 hours/room = 30 hours - 10 hours = 20 hours

Step 4: Calculate the time taken to paint the remaining rooms
* The painter needs to paint 4 rooms (6 rooms - 2 rooms already done = 4 rooms).
* Each room takes 5 hours to paint, so the time taken to paint the remaining rooms is: 4 rooms x 5 hours/room = 20 hours

Step 5: Calculate the time remaining to paint the rest
* The painter has already taken 10 hours to paint the 2 rooms that are already done.
* To find the time remaining to paint the rest, subtract the time taken to paint the remaining rooms from the total time remaining: 20 hours - 10 hours = 10 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of customers
The waiter had 22 customers in his section initially.

Step 2: Identify the number of customers who left
14 customers left.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of customers
To find the remaining number of customers, subtract the number of customers who left from the initial number:

22 - 14 = 8

Step 4: Identify the number of customers at each table
The rest of his tables had 4 people at each table.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of customers at the remaining tables
Since each table has 4 people, multiply the number of tables by 4 to find the total number of customers:

Number of tables × 4 =?

Step 6: Equate the total number of customers at the remaining tables with the remaining number of customers
Set up an equation:

Number of tables × 4 = 8

Step 7: Solve for the number of tables
Divide both sides of the equation by 4:

Number of tables = 8 ÷ 4
= 2

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Roger had 120 pieces of clothing to wash.
We know this because the problem statement tells us so.

Step 2: He put 48 pieces of clothing in one load.
This means that 48 pieces of clothing have already been accounted for.

Step 3: Roger decided to split the rest into 9 equal loads.
This means that we need to find out how many pieces of clothing are left after the first load, and then divide that number by 9 to find the number of pieces of clothing that can go in each small load.

Step 4: To find the number of pieces of clothing left after the first load, we subtract the number of pieces of clothing in the first load from the total number of pieces of clothing: 120 - 48 = 72
This leaves us with 72 pieces of clothing that need to be split into 9 equal loads.

Step 5: To find the number of pieces of clothing that can go in each small load, we divide the number of pieces of clothing left (72) by the number of small loads (9): 72 ÷ 9 = 8
This means that each small load can hold 8 pieces of clothing.

Roger is helping put away books at the library. There are 14 books in total, but a librarian takes 2 of them, leaving Roger with the rest.

Step 2: Calculate the number of books left
If the librarian takes 2 books, Roger will be left with:
14 (initial books) - 2 (books taken) = 12 books

Step 3: Determine how many books can fit on a shelf
Roger can fit 3 books on a shelf.

Step 4: Calculate how many shelves are needed
To find out how many shelves Roger will need, we need to divide the number of books left (12) by the number of books that can fit on a shelf (3).

We know that Bianca picked 39 tulips and 49 roses, and she used 81 flowers in total.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of flowers Bianca picked.
To do this, we add the number of tulips and roses she picked:
39 (tulips) + 49 (roses) = 88

Step 3: Determine how many flowers Bianca used.
According to the problem, she used 81 flowers.

Step 4: Calculate the difference between the total number of flowers Bianca picked and the number of flowers she used.
To find the number of extra flowers Bianca picked, we subtract the number of flowers she used from the total number of flowers she picked:

6 (red apples) + 15 (green apples) = 21 apples

Step 2: Determine the number of students who wanted fruit.
According to the problem, only 5 students wanted fruit.

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples needed for the students.
Since each student wants fruit, and there are 5 students, we need to multiply the number of students by the number of apples each student wants (assuming one apple per student):

5 students × 1 apple/student = 5 apples

Step 4: Calculate the number of extra apples the cafeteria has.
The cafeteria ordered 21 apples in total, but only 5 apples are needed for the students. To find the number of extra apples, we subtract the number of apples needed from the total number of apples:

21 apples (ordered) - 5 apples (needed) = 16 apples

Step 5: Determine the answer.
The cafeteria ended up with 16 extra apples.

{The final answer is 16 extra apples.}<|eot_id|>",16,16.0,16.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of people participating in the game.

There are 9 managers and 15 employees, so the total number of people is:

9 (managers) + 15 (employees) = 24

Step 2: Determine how many teams they will split into.

The problem states that they will split into 8 teams.

Step 3: Calculate the number of people on each team.

To find the number of people on each team, we can divide the total number of people (24) by the number of teams (8):

24 ÷ 8 = 3

Step 4: Check if the result makes sense.

Having 3 people on each team seems reasonable, as it's a common number for a volleyball team.

{The final answer is} 3 people would be on each team.<|eot_id|>",3,3.0,3.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of books in the bargain bin.
The book store had 4 books in the bargain bin initially.

Step 2: Determine how many books were sold.
The book store sold 3 books.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of books in the bargain bin after the sale.
To find the remaining number of books, subtract the number of books sold (3) from the initial number of books (4):
4 - 3 = 1

So, after the sale, there would be 1 book left in the bargain bin.

Step 4: Determine how many more books were added to the bargain bin.
The book store added 10 more books to the bin.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of books in the bargain bin after the addition.
To find the total number of books, add the remaining number of books (1) to the number of new books added (10):

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of potatoes that need to be cooked.
The chef has already cooked 5 potatoes, and he needs to cook a total of 13 potatoes. To find the number of potatoes that need to be cooked, we subtract the number of potatoes already cooked from the total number of potatoes:

13 (total potatoes) - 5 (already cooked) = 8 potatoes

Step 2: Determine the total cooking time needed for the remaining potatoes.
Since each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, we multiply the number of potatoes that need to be cooked by the cooking time:

8 potatoes x 6 minutes/potato = 48 minutes

Step 3: Determine the total cooking time needed, including the time already spent cooking.
The chef has already spent 5 x 6 = 30 minutes cooking the potatoes he has already cooked. To find the total cooking time needed, we add the time already spent cooking to the time needed to cook the remaining potatoes:

30 minutes (already spent) + 48 minutes (remaining potatoes) = 78 minutes

Step 4: Write the final answer.
The chef will need 78 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Paige has 43 math problems and 12 science problems for homework.
* She finished 44 problems at school.

Step 2: Break down the problem into smaller parts.

* Let's focus on the math problems first. Paige had 43 math problems initially. She finished 44 problems at school, which means she has some remaining math problems. Let's find out how many.
* We can subtract the number of problems she finished (44) from the initial number of math problems (43) to find the remaining math problems. This is because we know she didn't finish all of them.

43 (initial math problems) - 44 (problems finished) =?

Step 3: Perform the subtraction.

43 - 44 = -1

* Oops! We can't subtract 44 from 43 because it's a negative number. This means Paige didn't have enough math problems to finish 44. She must have finished fewer than 44 math problems.

Step 4: Think about the science problems.

* Paige had 12 science problems initially. She finished some of them at school, but we don't know how many. Let's assume she finished some, but not all, of them.

Step 5: Combine the remaining math problems with the unfinished science problems.

* Paige has -1 remaining math problems (because she didn't finish 44, but rather fewer). She still has 12 science problems, but we don't know how many she finished. Let's assume she finished some, but not all, of them.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of remaining problems.

* Add the remaining math problems (-1) to the remaining science problems (12). We don't know how many science problems she finished, so we'll add the entire 12 to the -1 math problems.

-1 (remaining math problems) + 12 (remaining science problems) = 11

* Paige has 11 remaining problems to do for homework.

Step 2: Determine the cost of each type of flower.

* Roses: Since each flower is $8, the cost of 3 roses is:
3 x $8 = $24

* Daisies: Since each flower is $8, the cost of 3 daisies is:
3 x $8 = $24

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all the flowers Vanessa bought.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded to Facebook.
Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 pictures from her camera, so the total number of pictures is:
5 (phone) + 35 (camera) = 40 pictures

Step 2: Determine the number of albums Olivia created.
Olivia created 8 different albums.

Step 3: Divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find the number of pictures in each album.
To find the number of pictures in each album, we divide the total number of pictures (40) by the number of albums (8):

40 pictures ÷ 8 albums = 5 pictures per album

Step 4: Verify the answer.
To ensure our answer is correct, let's count the number of pictures in each album. If we assume each album has 5 pictures, we can count:

Album 1: 5 pictures
Album 2: 5 pictures
Album 3: 5 pictures
...
Album 8: 5 pictures

Total number of pictures in all albums: 5 + 5 + 5 +... + 5 = 40 pictures

This matches the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded, so our answer is correct.

Wendy uploaded 22 pictures from her phone and 2 pictures from her camera, so the total number of pictures is:
22 (phone) + 2 (camera) = 24 pictures

Step 2: Determine how many pictures are in each album.
Since Wendy sorted the pictures into 4 albums with the same number of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures (24) by 4 to find the number of pictures in each album:
24 ÷ 4 = 6 pictures per album

Step 3: Verify that the calculation makes sense.
Let's check that the total number of pictures (24) is indeed divisible by 4 (the number of albums). If the calculation is correct, we should be able to multiply the number of pictures per album (6) by the number of albums (4) to get the total number of pictures:
6 pictures per album × 4 albums = 24 pictures

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the task Jerry needs to accomplish
Jerry needs to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another.

Step 2: Determine the maximum number of trays Jerry can carry at a time
Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of trays Jerry needs to pick up
Jerry needs to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another. To find the total number of trays, we add these numbers together:

9 trays + 7 trays = 16 trays

Step 4: Calculate the number of trips Jerry will need to make to pick up all the trays
Since Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, we need to divide the total number of trays (16) by 8 to find the number of trips he'll need to make:

16 trays ÷ 8 trays/trip = 2 trips

However, this calculation assumes Jerry can pick up all 16 trays in one trip. But he can't, because he can only carry 8 trays at a time. So, we need to make multiple trips to pick up all the trays.

Step 5: Calculate the number of trips Jerry will need to make to pick up all the trays, taking into account his carrying capacity
Since Jerry needs to pick up 16 trays, and he can only carry 8 trays at a time, we need to make multiple trips. Let's calculate the number of trips needed:

16 trays ÷ 8 trays/trip = 2 trips (to pick up 16 trays)

However, Jerry still needs to pick up 2 trays (9 - 8 = 1 tray, and 7 - 0 = 7 trays). Since he can only carry 8 trays at a time, he'll need to make one more trip to pick up these remaining 2 trays.

So, the total number of trips Jerry will need to make is:

                     Wendy had 82 files on her computer. She deleted 37 of them and put the rest into folders with, 5 files in, each! one. How many? folders did Wendy end up with?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Wendy had 82 files initially.

Step 2: She deleted 37 files. To find the number of files left, we subtract 37 from 82:

82 - 37 = 45

So, Wendy has 45 files left.

Step 3: She put the remaining files into folders with 5 files in each. To find the number of folders needed, we divide the number of files left (45) by the number of files per folder (5):

45 ÷ 5 = 9

So, Wendy needs 9 folders.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of players on the team.
There are 12 new players and 44 returning players, so the total number of players is:

12 (new players) + 44 (returning players) = 56 players

Step 2: Determine the number of players in each group.
The coach wants to put the players into groups with 8 players in each group.

Step 3: Divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.
To find the number of groups, we can divide the total number of players (56) by the number of players in each group (8):

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Step 4: Determine the number of groups.
Since we can divide the total number of players (56) by the number of players in each group (8) exactly 7 times, there will be 7 groups.

Will made $104 mowing lawns over the summer.

Step 2: Determine how much money he spent on new mower blades.
He spent $41 on new mower blades.

Step 3: Calculate how much money Will had left after buying the new mower blades.
To do this, we subtract the amount spent on mower blades from the initial amount made:
$104 (initial amount) - $41 (amount spent) = $63

Step 4: Determine how many 9-dollar games he could buy with the money he had left.
Since each game costs $9, we can divide the amount of money left ($63) by the cost of each game ($9) to find the number of games he can buy:
$63 ÷ $9 = 7

Sam filled 3 bags on Saturday. Each bag has 9 cans, so the total number of cans in the bags filled on Saturday is:

3 bags x 9 cans/bag = 27 cans

Step 3: Calculate the number of cans in the bags filled on Sunday
Sam filled 4 more bags on Sunday. Each bag has 9 cans, so the total number of cans in the bags filled on Sunday is:

4 bags x 9 cans/bag = 36 cans

Step 4: Calculate the total number of cans collected
To find the total number of cans collected, we add the number of cans collected on Saturday and Sunday:

The chef has already cooked 6 potatoes, and there are a total of 12 potatoes to be cooked.

Step 2: Identify the unknown quantity
We want to find out how long it will take the chef to cook the rest of the potatoes.

Step 3: Calculate the number of potatoes left to be cooked
The chef has already cooked 6 potatoes, so the number of potatoes left to be cooked is:

12 (total potatoes) - 6 (already cooked) = 6

Step 4: Calculate the total cooking time for the remaining potatoes
Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, so the total cooking time for the 6 remaining potatoes is:

6 (remaining potatoes) x 6 (minutes per potato) = 36 minutes

Step 5: Calculate the time it will take to cook the rest of the potatoes
The chef has already cooked 6 potatoes, which took a total of 36 minutes. To find out how long it will take to cook the rest of the potatoes, we subtract the time already spent cooking from the total cooking time:

The pet store had 38 Siamese cats and 25 house cats. To find the total number of cats, I add these two numbers together:

38 (Siamese cats) + 25 (house cats) = 63 cats

Step 2: Identify the number of cats sold
During the sale, 45 cats were sold.

Step 3: Subtract the number of cats sold from the initial total
To find the number of cats left, I subtract the number of cats sold from the initial total:

63 (initial cats) - 45 (cats sold) =?

Step 4: Perform the subtraction
63 - 45 = 18

Step 5: State the answer
{The final answer is} 18 cats.<|eot_id|>",18,18.0,18.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Carol scored 17 points in the first round.
Step 2: Carol scored 6 points in the second round.
Step 3: In the last round, Carol lost 16 points.

To find the total points Carol had at the end of the game, we need to add the points she scored in the first two rounds and then subtract the points she lost in the last round.

Step 4: Add the points Carol scored in the first two rounds:
17 (points in first round) + 6 (points in second round) = 23

Step 5: Subtract the points Carol lost in the last round:
23 - 16 = 7

Step 6: Carol had 7 points at the end of the game.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy.

Step 2: He gave 5 boxes to his little brother.

Step 3: To find out how many boxes Dave still has, we subtract the number of boxes he gave away from the total number of boxes he bought:

12 (initial boxes) - 5 (boxes given away) = 7

So, Dave still has 7 boxes of chocolate candy.

Step 4: Each box contains 3 pieces of chocolate candy. To find out how many pieces Dave still has, we multiply the number of boxes he still has by the number of pieces per box:

7 (boxes) x 3 (pieces per box) = 21

Step 5: Therefore, Dave still has 21 pieces of chocolate candy.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
A waiter, A, had 39 customers to wait on initially. During the lunch rush, he added 12 more customers, making a total of:

39 (initial customers) + 12 (additional customers) = 51 customers

Step 2: Identify the information we need to find
We need to find out how many customers left a tip. The problem states that 49 customers didn't leave a tip. To find the number of customers who left a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers.

Step 3: Calculate the number of customers who left a tip
We know that 49 customers didn't leave a tip. To find the number of customers who left a tip, we subtract 49 from the total number of customers:

51 (total customers) - 49 (customers who didn't leave a tip) = 2

Step 4: Write the final answer

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of apples.
The cafeteria had 50 apples.

Step 2: Determine how many apples were handed out to students.
The cafeteria handed out 5 apples to students.

Step 3: Subtract the number of apples handed out from the initial number of apples.
50 (initial apples) - 5 (apples handed out) = 45 apples remaining

Step 4: Determine the number of apples needed to make pies.
Each pie takes 5 apples.

Step 5: Divide the number of remaining apples by the number of apples needed per pie.
45 (remaining apples) ÷ 5 (apples per pie) = 9 pies

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Oliver had 33 dollars in January.

Initial amount = 33 dollars

Step 2: By March, he had spent 4 dollars.

To find the remaining amount, subtract the amount spent from the initial amount:

Remaining amount = 33 - 4 = 29 dollars

Step 3: If he got another 32 dollars from his mom.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: The school cafeteria started with 14 apples.

Step 2: They used 13 apples to make lunch for the students. To find the remaining apples, I'll subtract 13 from 14:

14 - 13 = 1

So, they have 1 apple left.

Step 3: The school cafeteria then bought 49 more apples. To find the total number of apples they have now, I'll add the remaining 1 apple to the new apples:

1 + 49 = 50

Step 4: Therefore, the school cafeteria now has 50 apples.

Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts. To find the total number of shirts, we add these two numbers together:

40 (short sleeve) + 23 (long sleeve) = 63 shirts

Step 2: Identify the number of shirts Sam washed before school started.
Sam washed 29 shirts by the time school started.

Step 3: Find the number of shirts Sam did not wash.
To find the number of shirts Sam did not wash, we subtract the number of shirts he washed (29) from the total number of shirts he had to wash (63).

47 - 41 = 6

So, the waiter is left with 6 customers.

Step 3: The waiter gets another 20 customers. To find the total number of customers he now has, we add the 6 customers he had initially to the 20 new customers:

6 + 20 = 26

Therefore, the waiter now has 26 customers.
