                    question:
                    :  Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 ; old songs ; from it and? then added 8. new songs,. how many songs does she? have on her mp3 player?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Paige has 11 songs initially.

Step 2: She deletes 9 old songs. To find the number of songs remaining, subtract 9 from 11:

11 - 9 = 2

So, Paige has 2 songs left on her mp3 player after deleting the old songs.

Step 3: She then adds 8 new songs.

To find the total number of songs she has now, add the 2 songs remaining from Step 2 to the 8 new songs:

2 + 8 = 10

Step 4: The final answer is the total number of songs Paige has on her mp3 player after adding the new songs. Therefore, the answer is:

{The final answer is 10.}<|eot_id|>",10

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
April is selling roses at a discount, and each rose costs $4. She starts with 13 roses and has 4 roses left. We need to find out how much money she earned.

Step 2: Calculate the number of roses sold
April starts with 13 roses and has 4 roses left. To find out how many roses she sold, we subtract the number of roses left from the initial number of roses:

13 (initial roses) - 4 (roses left) = 9 roses sold

Step 3: Calculate the total amount earned
Since each rose costs $4, we multiply the number of roses sold by the price of each rose:

9 (roses sold) x $4 (price per rose) = $36

Step 4: Check if the answer makes sense
The answer of $36 seems reasonable, considering April started with 13 roses and sold most of them.

{The final answer is $36}<|eot_id|>",36

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of shirts Ned had to wash.
Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts. To find the total number of shirts, we add these two numbers together:

9 (short sleeve shirts) + 21 (long sleeve shirts) = 30 shirts

Step 2: Identify the number of shirts Ned had washed by the time school started.
According to the problem, Ned had washed 29 shirts by the time school started.

Step 3: Find the number of shirts Ned did not wash.
To find the number of shirts Ned did not wash, we subtract the number of shirts he had washed (29) from the total number of shirts he had to wash (30).

30 (total shirts) - 29 (shirts washed) = 1 shirt

Step 4: Verify the answer.
We can verify that our answer makes sense by thinking about it in real-life terms. If Ned had washed 29 shirts and he had to wash a total of 30 shirts, it means he has 1 shirt left to wash.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of people who actually showed up.

The problem states that 47 people were invited, but 7 didn't show up. To find the number of people who actually showed up, we subtract the number of people who didn't show up from the total number of people invited:

47 (total invited) - 7 (didn't show up) = 40

So, 40 people actually showed up.

Step 2: Determine the number of people who can fit at each table.

The problem states that the tables can hold 5 people each. This means that each table can accommodate 5 people.

Step 3: Divide the number of people who showed up by the number of people who can fit at each table.

To find the number of tables needed, we divide the number of people who showed up (40) by the number of people who can fit at each table (5):

40 ÷ 5 = 8

Step 4: Determine the number of tables needed.

Since we need to accommodate 40 people, and each table can hold 5 people, we need:

Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. To find the total number of sodas, we add these two numbers together:

41 + 22 = 63

So, Jerry has a total of 63 sodas.

Step 2: Determine how many sodas can fit on each shelf:

Jerry's fridge can hold 9 sodas on each shelf.

Step 3: Calculate how many shelves Jerry would need to fill:

To find out how many shelves Jerry would need, we divide the total number of sodas (63) by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf (9):

63 ÷ 9 = 7

So, Jerry would need 7 shelves to fill.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial amount of candy Debby and her sister had combined.

Debby had 32 pieces of candy.
Her sister had 42 pieces of candy.

To find the total amount of candy they had, we add the two numbers together:

32 + 42 = 74

So, they had a total of 74 pieces of candy initially.

Step 2: Identify the number of pieces they ate the first night.

They ate 35 pieces of candy the first night.

Step 3: Subtract the number of pieces they ate from the initial total to find the remaining amount of candy.

74 (initial total) - 35 (pieces eaten) =?

Let's subtract:

74 - 35 = 39

So, they have 39 pieces of candy left after eating 35 pieces the first night.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem

* Emily started with 41 seeds.
* She planted 29 seeds in the big garden.
* She planted 4 seeds in each of her small gardens.

Step 2: Calculate the number of seeds Emily has left after planting in the big garden

* Emily started with 41 seeds.
* She planted 29 seeds in the big garden, so she has:
41 - 29 = 12 seeds left

Step 3: Calculate the total number of seeds Emily planted in her small gardens

* Emily planted 4 seeds in each of her small gardens.
* Let's call the number of small gardens x.
* The total number of seeds planted in small gardens is:
4x

Step 4: Set up an equation to represent the situation

* Emily has 12 seeds left after planting in the big garden. These seeds are distributed among her small gardens.
* The total number of seeds planted in small gardens (4x) plus the seeds left over (12) is equal to the original number of seeds Emily had (41).
* This can be represented by the equation:
4x + 12 = 41

Step 5: Solve the equation for x

* Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
4x = 41 - 12
4x = 29
* Divide both sides of the equation by 4:
x = 29/4
x = 7.25

Step 6: Since you can't have a fraction of a garden, round up to the nearest whole number

* Emily has 7.25 small gardens, but since you can't have a fraction of a garden, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is:
8 small gardens

{The final answer is 8 small gardens.}<|eot_id|>",3

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Determine the number of windows left to be installed
The builder had already installed 8 windows, and a total of 14 windows are needed. To find the number of windows left to be installed, subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed:

14 (total windows needed) - 8 (windows already installed) = 6

{So, 6 windows are left to be installed.}

Step 2: Determine the number of hours required to install the remaining windows
Each window takes 8 hours to install, and there are 6 windows left to be installed. To find the total number of hours required to install the remaining windows, multiply the number of windows by the number of hours per window:

6 (windows left) × 8 (hours per window) = 48 hours

{So, it will take 48 hours to install the remaining 6 windows.}

Step 1: The store had 40 oranges initially.
{Initial number of oranges: 40}

Step 2: They threw away 25 old oranges.
{Number of oranges thrown away: 25}

Step 3: The store subtracts the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number.
{New number of oranges = 40 - 25 = 15}

Step 4: The store then puts 21 new oranges into the bin.
{Number of new oranges added: 21}

Step 5: To find the final number of oranges in the bin, we add the new oranges to the remaining oranges.
{New total number of oranges = 15 + 21 = 36}

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is 36 oranges in the bin}.<|eot_id|>",36

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
We know that the waiter had 7 customers, and 5 of them didn't leave a tip.

Step 2: Determine the number of customers who left a tip
If 5 customers didn't leave a tip, that means the remaining customers did leave a tip. Let's subtract 5 from 7 to find the number of customers who left a tip:

7 (total customers) - 5 (customers who didn't leave a tip) = 2

So, 2 customers left a tip.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money earned from tips
The waiter received $3 from each customer who left a tip. Since there are 2 customers who left a tip, we multiply the number of customers by the amount of money earned per customer:

2 (customers who left a tip) x $3 (per customer) = $6

Step 4: Write the final answer
The waiter earned a total of $6 from the tips left by the 2 customers who left a tips.

{The final answer is $6}.<|eot_id|>",6

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Faye starts with 47 pieces of candy.

Step 2: She eats 25 pieces on the first night. To find out how many pieces she has left, we subtract 25 from 47:

47 - 25 = 22

So, Faye has 22 pieces of candy left after eating 25 pieces on the first night.

Step 3: Her sister gives her 40 more pieces of candy. To find out how many pieces Faye has now, we add the 40 pieces her sister gave her to the 22 pieces she had left:

22 + 40 = 62

Therefore, Faye has 62 pieces of candy now.

Initially, there were 9 chicken wings. After cooking 7 more, the total number of chicken wings becomes:
9 + 7 = 16

Step 4: Determine the number of people in the group.
There are 4 friends in the group.

Step 5: Calculate the number of chicken wings each person would get if they each got the same amount.
To find the number of chicken wings each person would get, we divide the total number of chicken wings (16) by the number of people (4):

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total amount John was supposed to earn if he had mowed all 15 lawns.

John earns $8 for each lawn he mows. To find the total amount he was supposed to earn, we multiply the number of lawns by the amount he earns per lawn:

15 lawns x $8 per lawn = $120

Step 2: Determine the number of lawns John actually mowed.

John forgot to mow 7 lawns, so he only mowed:

15 lawns - 7 lawns = 8 lawns

Step 3: Calculate the amount John actually earned.

Since John only mowed 8 lawns, we multiply the number of lawns he actually mowed by the amount he earns per lawn:

8 lawns x $8 per lawn = $64

Step 4: Determine the final answer.

John actually earned $64.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of puppies at the shelter.
The pet shelter had 5 puppies initially.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of puppies at the shelter after the additional 35 puppies are brought in.
The shelter starts with 5 puppies, and 35 more are brought in, so the total number of puppies is:
5 + 35 = 40 puppies

Step 3: Identify the number of puppies that are adopted each day.
8 puppies are adopted each day.

Step 4: Calculate the number of days it would take to adopt all the puppies.
To find the number of days, we need to divide the total number of puppies (40) by the number of puppies adopted each day (8).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
The builder needs to install 9 windows, and they have already installed 6 of them.

Step 2: Calculate the number of windows that still need to be installed.
To do this, subtract the number of windows already installed (6) from the total number of windows needed (9):

9 - 6 = 3

So, 3 windows still need to be installed.

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to install one window.
According to the problem, it takes 6 hours to install one window.

Step 4: Calculate the time it will take to install the remaining 3 windows.
Since it takes 6 hours to install one window, we can multiply this time by the number of windows that still need to be installed (3):

6 hours/window × 3 windows = 18 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of adults in the group.
We know that 9 people are kids, and the total number of people is 13. Therefore, the number of adults is:

13 (total people) - 9 (kids) = 4 adults

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the adult meals.
Each adult meal costs $7, and there are 4 adults. Therefore, the total cost of the adult meals is:

4 (adults) x $7 (per adult) = $28

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the kids' meals.
Since kids eat for free, the cost of the kids' meals is $0.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for the group.
We already calculated the cost of the adult meals ($28). Since the kids' meals are free, we don't need to add anything to that total. Therefore, the total cost for the group is:

$28 (adult meals) + $0 (kids' meals) = $28

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Wendy uploaded 79 pictures to Facebook. She put 44 pictures into one album.

* We know the total number of pictures is 79.
* We know 44 pictures were put into one album.

Step 2: Find the number of pictures left after putting 44 into one album.

* 79 (total pictures) - 44 (pictures in one album) = 35 pictures left

Step 3: Wendy put the remaining 35 pictures into 5 different albums.

* Since there are 5 albums, we can divide the remaining 35 pictures by 5 to find the number of pictures in each album.

* 35 (remaining pictures) ÷ 5 (number of albums) = 7 pictures per album

Step 4: Combine the 44 pictures in the first album with the 7 pictures in each of the remaining 5 albums.

* The first album has 44 pictures.
* The remaining 5 albums each have 7 pictures, so the total number of pictures in these albums is:
	+ 5 albums × 7 pictures per album = 35 pictures

Step 5: Add the pictures in the first album (44) to the pictures in the remaining albums (35).

* 44 (pictures in first album) + 35 (pictures in remaining albums) = 79 pictures

Step 6: Verify that the total number of pictures is correct.

* 79 (total pictures) is equal to the sum of the pictures in the first album (44) and the pictures in the remaining albums (35).

The final answer is: Each album, except the first one, has 7 pictures. The first album has 44 pictures.<|eot_id|>",7

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of students on the debate team.
There are 5 boys and 40 girls, so the total number of students is:
5 (boys) + 40 (girls) = 45 students

Step 2: Determine the number of students in each group.
The problem states that the students are to be split into groups of 9. Let's call the number of groups x.

Step 3: Write an equation to represent the situation.
The total number of students (45) is equal to the number of groups (x) multiplied by the number of students in each group (9). This can be represented as:
45 = x × 9

Step 4: Solve the equation for x.
To find the number of groups, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:
x = 45 ÷ 9
x = 5

Step 5: Interpret the result.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of cats.
The pet store had 13 Siamese cats and 5 house cats. To find the total number of cats, I add the two numbers together:

13 (Siamese cats) + 5 (house cats) = 18 cats

Step 2: Determine the number of cats sold.
The pet store sold 10 cats during the sale.

Step 3: Subtract the number of cats sold from the initial total.
To find the number of cats left, I subtract the number of cats sold from the initial total:

18 (initial cats) - 10 (cats sold) = 8

Step 4: Verify the answer.
Let's double-check our answer by adding the number of cats left to the number of cats sold. This should equal the initial number of cats minus the number of cats sold:

8 (cats left) + 10 (cats sold) = 18 - 10 = 8

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the task
Luke needs to pick up lunch trays, and he can carry 4 trays at a time.

Step 2: Determine the total number of trays to be picked up
Luke needs to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another. To find the total number of trays, we add these two numbers together:

20 trays + 16 trays = 36 trays

Step 3: Determine the number of trips needed
Since Luke can carry 4 trays at a time, we need to divide the total number of trays (36) by 4 to find the number of trips needed:

36 trays ÷ 4 trays/trip = 9 trips

Step 4: Check the answer
To confirm, let's calculate the total number of trays Luke will carry on each trip:

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the number of action figures Henry needs to collect.
Henry needs a total of 8 action figures to complete his collection, but he already has 3. Therefore, he needs to collect:

8 (total needed) - 3 (already has) = 5

Step 2: Determine the cost of each action figure.
Each action figure costs $6.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the action figures Henry needs to collect.
Since Henry needs to collect 5 action figures, and each one costs $6, the total cost would be:

5 (number of action figures needed) x $6 (cost per action figure) = $30

Step 4: Add the cost of the action figures to the cost of the action figures Henry already has.
Henry already has 3 action figures, which would cost:

3 (number of action figures already has) x $6 (cost per action figure) = $18

Adding the cost of the new action figures to the cost of the action figures Henry already has, we get:

* Vanessa picked 17 carrots
* Her mother picked 14 carrots
* Only 24 carrots were good

Step 2: Find the total number of carrots picked by both Vanessa and her mother

* Total carrots picked = Vanessa's carrots + Mother's carrots
* Total carrots picked = 17 + 14
* Total carrots picked = 31

Step 3: Since only 24 carrots were good, the number of bad carrots can be found by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of people participating in the game.

We are told that 23 managers and 7 employees decided to play. To find the total number of people, we add these two numbers together:

23 (managers) + 7 (employees) = 30

Step 2: Determine the number of teams.

The problem states that they will split into 6 teams. This means we need to divide the total number of people (30) by 6 to find the number of people on each team.

Step 3: Divide the total number of people by the number of teams.

30 (total people) ÷ 6 (number of teams) =?

To divide 30 by 6, we can perform the calculation:

30 ÷ 6 = 5

Step 4: Determine the number of people on each team.

Since we divided the total number of people (30) by the number of teams (6), we can conclude that each team will have:

                    question:
                    ? Tiffany baked 8 brownies, but needed 17! total for ; her party. If she : used 8 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem

* Tiffany baked 8 brownies.
* She needs a total of 17 brownies for her party.
* She used 8 cups of flour for each brownie.

Step 2: Determine how many cups of flour she used so far

* Tiffany used 8 cups of flour for each of the 8 brownies she baked, so she used a total of:
8 brownies x 8 cups/brownie = 64 cups of flour

Step 3: Calculate how many cups of flour she still needs

* Tiffany needs a total of 17 brownies, but she only baked 8. To find out how many more brownies she needs to bake, subtract the number of brownies she baked from the total number of brownies needed:
17 brownies - 8 brownies = 9 brownies

* Since each brownie requires 8 cups of flour, Tiffany needs:
9 brownies x 8 cups/brownie = 72 cups of flour

* However, she already used 64 cups of flour, so she still needs:
72 cups of flour - 64 cups of flour = 8 cups of flour

The final answer is: Tiffany still needs 8 cups of flour.<|eot_id|>",72

* Carol and her mom picked a total of x carrots from their garden (x =?)
* Carol picked 29 carrots
* Her mom picked 16 carrots
* Only 38 carrots were good

Step 2: Calculate the total number of carrots picked

* To find the total number of carrots picked, add the number of carrots picked by Carol and her mom: 29 (Carol) + 16 (mom) = 45 carrots

Step 3: Identify the number of good carrots

* We know that only 38 carrots were good. This means that the remaining carrots are bad.

Step 4: Calculate the number of bad carrots

* To find the number of bad carrots, subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked: 45 (total carrots) - 38 (good carrots) = 7 bad carrots

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of worksheets the teacher has to grade. The problem states that she has 17 worksheets, and she has already graded 8 of them.

Step 2: Calculate the number of worksheets she still needs to grade. To do this, subtract the number of worksheets she has already graded (8) from the total number of worksheets she has (17).

17 (total worksheets) - 8 (already graded) = 9

{The teacher has 9 worksheets left to grade.}

Step 3: Identify the number of problems on each worksheet. The problem states that each worksheet has 7 problems.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of problems on the worksheets the teacher still needs to grade. To do this, multiply the number of worksheets she still needs to grade (9) by the number of problems on each worksheet (7).

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Cody initially won 49 tickets.

**Step 2:** He spent 25 tickets on a beanie. To find out how many tickets he has left, we subtract the number of tickets spent from the initial number of tickets won:

49 (initial tickets) - 25 (tickets spent) = 24 tickets left

**Step 3:** Cody later won 6 more tickets.

**Step 4:** To find out how many tickets he has now, we add the 6 new tickets won to the 24 tickets left:

24 tickets left + 6 new tickets = 30 tickets

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Bianca received 78 pieces of candy initially.

Step 2: She ate 30 pieces of candy, leaving her with:

78 - 30 = 48 pieces of candy remaining

Step 3: Bianca wants to put the remaining 48 pieces of candy into piles with 8 pieces in each pile.

Step 4: To find out how many piles she can make, we need to divide the remaining 48 pieces of candy by 8:

48 ÷ 8 = 6

Step 5: Since 48 divided by 8 leaves no remainder, Bianca can make exactly 6 piles with 8 pieces of candy in each pile.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the cost of an adult meal
The problem states that each adult meal costs $8.

Step 2: Identify the number of adult meals
There are 11 people in the group, and 2 of them are kids. To find the number of adult meals, subtract the number of kids from the total number of people:
11 (total people) - 2 (kids) = 9

So, there are 9 adult meals.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the adult meals
Multiply the number of adult meals by the cost of an adult meal:
9 (adult meals) x $8 (cost per meal) = $72

Step 4: Determine the cost of the kids' meals
The problem states that kids eat free, so the cost of the kids' meals is $0.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost for the group

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Roger starts with 25 books.

Step 2: He sells 21 books. To find out how much money he earns, we need to know the price of each book. Since this information is not given, we'll assume the price of each book is the same. Let's call it x.

Step 3: Roger earns x * 21 = 21x by selling 21 books.

Step 4: He uses the money he earned to buy 30 new books.

Step 5: To find the total number of books Roger has now, we add the number of books he had initially (25) to the number of new books he bought (30).

Step 6: So, Roger has 25 + 30 = 55 books.

However, we need to consider that the money he earned from selling books was used to buy new books. This means that the number of books he had after selling some and buying new ones is not simply the sum of the initial number of books and the number of new books.

Step 7: To account for this, we need to subtract the number of books he sold (21) from the total number of books he has now (55).

Step 8: So, Roger has 55 - 21 = 34 books.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Wendy initially had 10 lives.

Step 2: She lost 6 lives in the hard part of the game.

To find out how many lives she has left, we subtract the lives she lost from the initial number of lives:

10 (initial lives) - 6 (lives lost) = 4 lives

So, Wendy has 4 lives left.

Step 3: She gets 37 more lives in the next level.

To find out how many lives she has now, we add the new lives to the number of lives she had left:

Step 2: He spent $11 buying new mower blades.

Step 3: To find out how much money Frank has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent ($11) from the amount he made ($19).

$19 - $11 = $8

Step 4: Frank has $8 left.

Step 5: The problem asks how many 2-dollar games he could buy with the money he has left. To find this out, we need to divide the amount of money he has left ($8) by the cost of each game ($2).

$8 ÷ $2 = 4

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the total number of players on the team.
The team has 48 new players and 6 returning players, so the total number of players is:
48 (new players) + 6 (returning players) = 54 players

Step 2: Determine the number of players in each group.
The coach wants to put the players into groups with 6 players in each group.

Step 3: Divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.
To find the number of groups, divide the total number of players (54) by the number of players in each group (6):
54 ÷ 6 = 9

Step 4: Determine the number of groups.
Since we divided the total number of players by the number of players in each group, we can conclude that the coach can put the players into 9 groups with 6 players in each group.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Isabel uploaded 25 pictures to Facebook. We know she put some pictures into albums, but we don't know how many yet.

Step 2: She put 10 pictures into one album. This means we need to subtract 10 from the total number of pictures to find out how many are left.

25 (total pictures) - 10 (pictures in one album) = 15 pictures left

Step 3: The problem states that she put the rest of the pictures into 5 different albums. Since she put 10 pictures into one album, we know that the remaining 15 pictures are divided among the other 5 albums.

Step 4: To find out how many pictures are in each of the other 5 albums, we can divide the remaining 15 pictures by 5.

15 (remaining pictures) ÷ 5 (number of albums) = 3 pictures per album

Step 5: Finally, we need to add the 10 pictures in the first album to the 3 pictures per album in the other 5 albums to get the total number of pictures in each album.

For the first album: 10 pictures
For the other 5 albums: 3 pictures per album × 5 albums = 15 pictures

14 + 26 = 40 dollars

Step 2: Identify the weekly expense.
Mike spends 5 dollars per week.

Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks the money will last.
To find out how long the money will last, we need to divide the total amount of money (40 dollars) by the weekly expense (5 dollars).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of shirts Dave had to wash.

Dave had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts. To find the total number of shirts, I add these two numbers together:

9 (short sleeve) + 27 (long sleeve) = 36 shirts

Step 2: Identify the number of shirts Dave had washed by the time school started.

According to the problem, Dave had washed 20 shirts by the time school started.

The shelter received 34 more puppies, making the total number of puppies:

2 (initial puppies) + 34 (new puppies) = 36 puppies

Step 3: Determine the total number of puppies that need to be adopted.
Since 4 puppies are adopted each day, we need to find out how many days it would take to adopt all 36 puppies.

Step 4: Divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted each day.
To find the number of days, we divide the total number of puppies (36) by the number of puppies adopted each day (4):

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Will had 59 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 32 of them in one load.

* This means that 32 pieces of clothing are already accounted for.
* To find out how many pieces of clothing are left, we subtract 32 from 59:

59 - 32 = 27

So, Will has 27 pieces of clothing left to wash.

Step 2: Will decided to split the rest into 9 equal loads.

* Since there are 27 pieces of clothing left, we need to divide them evenly among the 9 loads.

Step 3: To find out how many pieces of clothing can go in each small load, we divide 27 by 9:

27 ÷ 9 = 3

So, each small load can have 3 pieces of clothing.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the sale price of each flower. According to the problem, the sale price of each flower is $6.

Step 2: Determine how many flowers Katie bought. Katie bought 5 roses and 5 daisies. Since we don't have information about the price of daisies, we'll treat them as a separate category.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the roses. Since each rose costs $6, the total cost of the roses is:

5 roses × $6/rose = $30

Step 4: Since we don't know the price of daisies, we'll treat them as a separate category. We'll come back to this later.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the flowers so far. The total cost of the roses is $30.

Step 6: Since we're still missing the cost of the daisies, we'll add the cost of the daisies to the total cost. However, we don't know the price of daisies, so we'll come back to this later.

Step 7: Since we've accounted for the cost of the roses, we can now calculate the total cost of the flowers. The total cost is $30 (roses) +? (daisies).

Step 8: To find the total cost, we need to know the price of the daisies. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide this information.

Step 9: Since we can't find the total cost without knowing the price of the daisies, we can't provide a final answer.

However, if we knew the price of the daisies, we could add it to the total cost of the roses to get the final answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate Jerry's total earnings from mowing lawns and weed eating.
Jerry made $14 from mowing lawns and $31 from weed eating. To find the total, I add these amounts together:

$14 + $31 = $45

Step 2: Determine Jerry's weekly expenses.
Jerry spends $5 per week. This is a fixed amount that he spends every week.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Jerry has.
Jerry has a total of $45 from his earnings. He also has no initial savings, so this is the total amount he has.

Step 4: Divide the total amount of money Jerry has by his weekly expenses.
To find out how long Jerry's money will last, I divide the total amount he has ($45) by his weekly expenses ($5):

$45 ÷ $5 = 9

Step 5: Interpret the result.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Nancy has:
* 2 shelves of mystery books
* 6 shelves of picture books

Step 2: Determine the number of books on each shelf.
Each shelf has exactly 6 books.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of books on the mystery book shelves.
Since there are 2 shelves of mystery books, and each shelf has 6 books, we multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf:
2 shelves × 6 books/shelf = 12 books

Step 4: Calculate the total number of books on the picture book shelves.
Since there are 6 shelves of picture books, and each shelf has 6 books, we multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf:
6 shelves × 6 books/shelf = 36 books

Step 5: Add the total number of books on the mystery book shelves and the picture book shelves.
12 books (mystery) + 36 books (picture) = 48 books

Step 2: Identify the number of members who didn't show up for the game.
The problem states that 7 members didn't show up.

Step 3: Calculate the number of members who did show up for the game.
To do this, subtract the number of members who didn't show up from the total number of members:
14 (total members) - 7 (members who didn't show up) = 7

So, 7 members showed up for the game.

Step 4: Calculate the total points scored by the members who showed up.
The problem states that each member who showed up scored 5 points. Since 7 members showed up, we multiply the number of members by the points scored per member:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Oliver starts with 46 books, but the librarian takes 10 of them. To find out how many books Oliver is left with, we subtract 10 from 46:

46 - 10 = 36

So, Oliver is left with 36 books.

Step 2: Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf. To find out how many shelves he will need, we need to divide the number of books he has left (36) by the number of books he can fit on a shelf (4).

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away the remaining 36 books.

* Each pile has 3 coins.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of quarters

* Since there are 5 piles of quarters, and each pile has 3 quarters, the total number of quarters is:
5 piles × 3 quarters/pile = 15 quarters

Step 3: Calculate the total number of dimes

* Since there are 5 piles of dimes, and each pile has 3 dimes, the total number of dimes is:
5 piles × 3 dimes/pile = 15 dimes

Step 4: Calculate the total number of coins

* The total number of coins is the sum of the quarters and dimes:
15 quarters + 15 dimes = 30 coins

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends. This means she spent money on 3 tickets.

Step 2: Each ticket costs 4 dollars, so the total cost of the 3 tickets is:
3 tickets x 4 dollars per ticket = 12 dollars

Step 3: Haley also bought 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. This means she spent more money on these additional tickets.

Step 4: The total number of tickets Haley bought is the initial 3 tickets plus the 5 extra tickets, which is:
3 + 5 = 8 tickets

Step 5: Since each ticket costs 4 dollars, the total cost of the 8 tickets is:
8 tickets x 4 dollars per ticket = 32 dollars

Step 6: Haley already spent 12 dollars on the initial 3 tickets, so to find the total amount she spent, we add the cost of the additional 5 tickets to the initial 12 dollars:

Step 2: Determine the number of birds in each cage. The problem states that each cage has ""8 parrots and 2 parakeets in it"". This means that each cage has a total of 8 parrots + 2 parakeets = 10 birds.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of birds in all 4 cages. Since each cage has 10 birds, we can multiply the number of cages by the number of birds per cage:

4 cages × 10 birds/cage = 40 birds

Step 4: The problem asks for the total number of ""birds"" (note the plural form). Since we've calculated the total number of birds, we can conclude that the pet store has 40 birds in total.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Kaleb bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy.

Step 2: He gave 5 boxes to his little brother.

To find out how many boxes Kaleb has left, we need to subtract the number of boxes he gave away from the total number of boxes he bought:

14 (total boxes) - 5 (boxes given away) = 9

So, Kaleb has 9 boxes of chocolate candy left.

Step 3: Each box has 6 pieces of chocolate candy inside it.

To find out how many pieces of chocolate candy Kaleb has left, we need to multiply the number of boxes he has left by the number of pieces in each box:

9 (boxes left) x 6 (pieces per box) = 54

So, Kaleb has 54 pieces of chocolate candy left.

Mike made $69 and spent $24 on new mower blades, so to find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he made:

$69 (made) - $24 (spent) = $45

So, Mike has $45 left.

Step 2: Determine how many 5-dollar games he could buy with the $45 he has left.

To find out how many 5-dollar games he could buy, we divide the amount of money he has left ($45) by the cost of each game ($5):

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the number of pictures Rachel took at the zoo and the museum.
Rachel took 6 pictures at the zoo and 9 pictures at the museum.

Step 2: Combine the number of pictures taken at the zoo and the museum.
Rachel took a total of 6 + 9 = 15 pictures.

Step 3: Rachel later deleted 11 pictures.
She deleted 11 pictures, which means she removed 11 pictures from her total.

Step 4: Subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures taken.
To find the number of pictures Rachel still has, subtract the number of deleted pictures (11) from the total number of pictures taken (15):

                    question:
                     Maria was making baggies of cookies! with 8 cookies in each bag.. If she had 5 chocolate chip cookies. and. 19 : oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of cookies Maria has.
Maria has 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies. To find the total number of cookies, we add these two numbers together:
5 (chocolate chip) + 19 (oatmeal) = 24 cookies

Step 2: Determine the number of baggies Maria can make with 8 cookies in each bag.
Since each baggie contains 8 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies (24) by 8 to find the number of baggies Maria can make:
24 cookies ÷ 8 cookies per baggie = 3 baggies

Step 3: Verify that Maria has enough cookies to make the calculated number of baggies.
Since Maria has 24 cookies and she can make 3 baggies with 8 cookies in each bag, we can verify that she has enough cookies by multiplying the number of baggies by the number of cookies per baggie:
3 baggies × 8 cookies per baggie = 24 cookies

Since the calculation matches the total number of cookies Maria has, we can conclude that she has enough cookies to make 3 baggies.

{The final answer is} Maria can make 3 baggies of cookies.<|eot_id|>",3

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* April's : discount flowers is having a sale where each! flower is $3.
* Zoe bought 8 roses and 2 : daisies.

Step 2: Determine the value of each rose and daisy.

* Since each! flower is $3, we can assume that the value of each rose is also $3, since it's not specified otherwise.
* The problem doesn't mention the value of daisies, so we'll assume it's also $3, although this might not be the actual value.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the roses.

* Zoe bought 8 roses, and each rose costs $3.
* Total cost of roses = 8 x $3 = $24

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the daisies.

* Zoe bought 2 daisies, and each daisy costs $3 (assuming).
* Total cost of daisies = 2 x $3 = $6

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of all the flowers.

* Total cost of flowers = Total cost of roses + Total cost of daisies = $24 + $6 = $30

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of cards John has to organize.

John has 8 new cards and 16 old cards, so he has a total of:

8 (new cards) + 16 (old cards) = 24 cards

Step 2: Calculate the number of cards that can fit on each page.

The problem states that John can fit 3 cards on each page.

Step 3: Divide the total number of cards by the number of cards that can fit on each page.

To find out how many pages John will need, we divide the total number of cards (24) by the number of cards that can fit on each page (3):

24 ÷ 3 = 8

Step 4: Since John can fit 3 cards on each page, he will need at least 8 pages to accommodate all his cards.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the problem statement
Isabel baked 3 brownies, but needed 5 total for her party. If she used 5 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?

Step 2: Determine the amount of flour used so far
Isabel used 5 cups of flour for each brownie, and she baked 3 brownies. To find the total amount of flour used, multiply the amount of flour used per brownie by the number of brownies:

5 cups/brownie × 3 brownies = 15 cups of flour

Step 3: Determine the total amount of flour needed
Isabel needs 5 brownies in total, and she already has 3. To find the total amount of flour needed, subtract the amount of flour used so far from the total amount of flour needed:

5 brownies × 5 cups/brownie = 25 cups of flour (total needed)

Step 4: Calculate the amount of flour still needed
Isabel used 15 cups of flour so far, and she needs a total of 25 cups of flour. To find the amount of flour still needed, subtract the amount of flour used so far from the total amount of flour needed:

25 cups (total needed) - 15 cups (used so far) = 10 cups of flour still needed

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
The painter needs to paint 6 rooms, and each room takes 5 hours to paint.
The painter has already painted 2 rooms.

Step 2: Calculate the total time taken to paint the 2 rooms already painted.
Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the total time taken to paint the 2 rooms is:
2 rooms x 5 hours/room = 10 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total time remaining to paint the rest of the rooms.
There are 6 rooms in total, and the painter has already painted 2. To find the remaining rooms, subtract the 2 rooms already painted from the total:
6 rooms - 2 rooms = 4 rooms

Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the total time remaining to paint the rest of the rooms is:
4 rooms x 5 hours/room = 20 hours

Step 4: Calculate the additional time needed to paint the rest of the rooms.
The painter has already taken 10 hours to paint the 2 rooms, and there are 20 hours remaining to paint the rest of the rooms. To find the additional time needed, subtract the time already taken from the time remaining:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
The waiter had 22 customers in his section initially.

Step 2: Identify the change
14 customers left, which means the number of customers remaining needs to be calculated.

Step 3: Calculate the number of customers remaining
22 (initial customers) - 14 (customers who left) = 8

Step 4: Understand the new information
The rest of the tables had 4 people at each table. This means that the 8 remaining customers are seated at tables with 4 people each.

Step 5: Calculate the number of tables
Since each table has 4 people, and there are 8 people remaining, we can divide the number of remaining customers by the number of people per table:

8 (remaining customers) ÷ 4 (people per table) = 2

Step 6: Conclusion
The waiter has 2 tables remaining.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Roger started with 120 pieces of clothing to wash.

Step 2: He put 48 pieces of clothing in one load. To find out how many pieces of clothing are left, we subtract 48 from 120:

120 - 48 = 72

So, there are 72 pieces of clothing left.

Step 3: Roger decided to split the remaining 72 pieces of clothing into 9 equal loads. To find out how many pieces of clothing can go in each small load, we divide 72 by 9:

72 ÷ 9 = 8

Step 4: The result of the division is 8, which means that 8 pieces of clothing can go in each of the small loads.

{The final answer is} 8 pieces of clothing can go in each of the small loads.<|eot_id|>",8

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Start with the initial number of students in fourth grade, which is 10.

Step 2: 4 students left the school, which means we subtract 4 from the initial number of students.

10 - 4 = 6

So, there are 6 students remaining from the initial group.

Step 3: 42 new students came to school. We add these new students to the remaining students.

6 + 42 = 48

Step 4: Combine the remaining students with the new students to find the total number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

There are initially 14 books. The librarian takes 2 away, so we subtract 2 from 14:

14 - 2 = 12

{So, Roger has 12 books left.}

Step 2: Determine how many books can fit on a shelf.

Roger can fit 3 books on a shelf.

Step 3: Divide the total number of books left (12) by the number of books that can fit on a shelf (3) to find the number of shelves needed.

39 (tulips) + 49 (roses) = 88 flowers

Step 2: Bianca used 81 of these flowers to make bouquets. To find the number of extra flowers she picked, we subtract the number of flowers used from the total number of flowers:

88 (total flowers) - 81 (flowers used) = 7

So, Bianca picked 7 extra flowers.

Step 4: Identify the number of parakeets in each cage.
Each cage has 7 parakeets.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of parakeets in all 6 cages.
Since each cage has 7 parakeets, we multiply the number of cages by the number of parakeets per cage:
6 cages x 7 parakeets/cage = 42 parakeets

Step 6: Calculate the total number of birds in all 6 cages.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of sodas Cody has.

Cody has 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas. To find the total number of sodas, we add these two numbers together:

4 (regular sodas) + 44 (diet sodas) = 48 sodas

Step 2: Determine the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Cody's fridge can hold 6 sodas on each shelf.

Step 3: Divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

To find the number of shelves Cody needs, we divide the total number of sodas (48) by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf (6):

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of students on the debate team.
The problem states that there are 26 boys and 46 girls on the team. To find the total number of students, we add the number of boys and girls:

26 (boys) + 46 (girls) = 72 students

Step 2: Determine the number of students that can be grouped into groups of 9.
To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of students (72) by the number of students in each group (9):

72 ÷ 9 = 8

Step 3: Check if there are any remaining students after grouping.
Since we divided the total number of students by the number of students in each group, we can check if there are any remaining students by multiplying the number of groups (8) by the number of students in each group (9):

8 × 9 = 72

Since the product is equal to the total number of students (72), we can conclude that there are no remaining students after grouping.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The book store initially has 4 books in the bargain bin.

Step 2: They sell 3 books, which means they remove 3 books from the bin.

To find the number of books left in the bin after selling 3 books, we subtract 3 from the initial 4 books:

4 (initial books) - 3 (books sold) = 1 book left in the bin

Step 3: After selling 3 books, the store puts 10 more books in the bin.

To find the total number of books in the bin after adding the new books, we add the 1 book left in the bin (from Step 2) to the 10 new books:

1 book left in the bin + 10 new books = 11 books in the bin

                    question:
                     April's discount flowers was having a sale where each! flower was, 8 dollars. ; If Vanessa. bought 3 : roses? and 3! daisies, how! much did she spend?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the sale price of each flower
The sale price of each! flower is $8.

Step 2: Identify the number of roses and daisies bought
Vanessa bought 3 roses and 3 daisies.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the roses
Since each rose is not marked with an exclamation point (!), we can assume the sale price of each rose is still $8. To calculate the total cost of the roses, we multiply the number of roses by the sale price of each rose:

3 roses × $8/rose = $24

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the daisies
Since each daisy is marked with an exclamation point (!), we need to apply the sale price of $8 to each daisy. To calculate the total cost of the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the sale price of each daisy:

3 daisies × $8/daisy = $24

Step 5: Add the total cost of the roses and daisies
To find the total amount Vanessa spent, we add the total cost of the roses and daisies:

$24 (roses) + $24 (daisies) = $48

{The final answer is $48.}<|eot_id|>",48

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of cookies Robin has.
She has 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies, so we add these numbers together:

23 + 25 = 48

{Step 1: Total number of cookies = 48}

Step 2: Since each baggie contains 6 cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies by 6 to find the number of baggies Robin can make:

48 ÷ 6 =?

To do this division, we can divide 48 by 6:

48 ÷ 6 = 8

{Step 2: Number of baggies = 8}

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Cody had 45 dollars initially.

Step 2: For his birthday, he got 9 more dollars. To find the new total amount of money Cody has, we add the initial amount to the amount he received as a gift:

45 (initial amount) + 9 (gift) = 54 dollars

Step 3: Cody spent 19 dollars on a new game. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the new total amount:

54 (new total amount) - 19 (amount spent) = 35 dollars

Step 4: Finally, we find out how much money Cody has now by stating the answer:

{The final answer is} 35 dollars.<|eot_id|>",35

Here's the step-by-step solution to the problem:

Step 1: Identify the initial amount of candy Katie and her sister have.
Katie has 8 pieces of candy.
Her sister has 23 pieces of candy.

Step 2: Combine the initial amount of candy Katie and her sister have.
To do this, I'll add the number of pieces Katie has (8) to the number of pieces her sister has (23).

8 + 23 = 31

So, Katie and her sister have a total of 31 pieces of candy initially.

Step 3: Identify the number of pieces they ate the first night.
They ate 8 pieces of candy the first night.

Step 4: Subtract the number of pieces they ate from the total amount of candy.
To find out how many pieces they have left, I'll subtract the number of pieces they ate (8) from the total amount of candy (31).

31 - 8 = 23

Step 5: The final answer is:
Katie and her sister have 23 pieces of candy left after eating 8 pieces the first night.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the number of puppies remaining after selling 34.

Initial number of puppies = 88
Number of puppies sold = 34
Remaining puppies = 88 - 34 = 54

Step 2: Determine the number of puppies that can fit in each cage.

Number of puppies per cage = 6

Step 3: Divide the remaining puppies by the number of puppies that can fit in each cage to find the number of cages needed.

Remaining puppies = 54
Number of puppies per cage = 6

Number of cages = 54 ÷ 6 = 9

Step 4: Check if there are any remaining puppies that don't fit in a cage.

Since 54 puppies can fit in 9 cages (with 6 puppies each), there are no remaining puppies that don't fit in a cage.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the problem
Jerry needs to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another. We need to find out how many trips he'll make to accomplish this.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of trays Jerry needs to pick up
9 trays (from one table) + 7 trays (from another table) = 16 trays

Step 3: Determine Jerry's carrying capacity
Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time.

Step 4: Calculate how many trips Jerry needs to make to pick up the total number of trays
To find the number of trips, we'll divide the total number of trays (16) by Jerry's carrying capacity (8).

16 trays ÷ 8 trays/trip = 2 trips

Step 5: Check if Jerry needs to make an additional trip for any remaining trays
Since Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, he'll need to make at least 2 trips to pick up the total number of trays (16). However, after making 2 trips, he'll still have 8 trays left to pick up (since 2 trips × 8 trays/trip = 16 trays).

Jerry will need to make an additional trip to pick up the remaining 8 trays.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of trips Jerry needs to make
2 trips (initial trips) + 1 trip (additional trip) = 3 trips

{The final answer is} Jerry will make 3 trips to pick up the lunch trays.<|eot_id|>",2

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the scoring mechanism
Faye scores 7 points for each treasure she finds.

Step 2: Determine the number of treasures found on each level
She found 2 treasures on the first level and 6 treasures on the second level.

Step 3: Calculate the total score for each level
For the first level, Faye finds 2 treasures and scores 7 points for each. So, her score for the first level is:
2 treasures x 7 points/treasure = 14 points

For the second level, Faye finds 6 treasures and scores 7 points for each. So, her score for the second level is:
6 treasures x 7 points/treasure = 42 points

Step 4: Add the scores for both levels to get the total score
Faye's total score is the sum of her scores for each level:
14 points (first level) + 42 points (second level) = 56 points

{The final answer is 56 points}.<|eot_id|>",56

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Wendy had 82 files initially.

Step 2: She deleted 37 files. To find the number of files left, subtract 37 from 82:

82 - 37 = 45

So, Wendy has 45 files left.

Step 3: She put the remaining 45 files into folders with 5 files in each one. To find the number of folders, divide the number of files left by the number of files per folder:

45 ÷ 5 = 9

Step 2: Determine the number of players in each group.

The coach is putting the players into groups with 8 players in each group.

Step 3: Divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.

To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players (56) by the number of players in each group (8):

56 ÷ 8 =?

Step 4: Perform the division.

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Step 5: Determine the number of groups.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of potatoes left to cook.
The chef needs to cook 12 potatoes, and he has already cooked 6. To find the number of potatoes left to cook, we subtract the number of potatoes already cooked from the total number of potatoes needed:

12 (total potatoes) - 6 (already cooked) = 6

{So, there are 6 potatoes left to cook.}

Step 2: Determine the total cooking time for the remaining potatoes.
Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, and there are 6 potatoes left to cook. To find the total cooking time, we multiply the number of potatoes left to cook by the time it takes to cook each potato:

6 (potatoes left) × 6 (minutes per potato) = 36 minutes

{So, it will take 36 minutes to cook the remaining 6 potatoes.}

The final answer is:<|eot_id|>",36

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Luke started with 57 games.

Step 2: He sold 39 games. To find out how many games he has left, we need to subtract the number of games sold from the initial number of games:

57 (initial number of games) - 39 (games sold) = 18

Step 3: Luke packed the rest of the games (18) into boxes, with 2 games per box. To find out how many boxes he needs, we need to divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:

18 (remaining games) ÷ 2 (games per box) = 9

Step 4: Since Luke needs to pack the remaining 18 games into boxes with 2 games per box, he will need 9 boxes.

The problem states that the waiter had 39 customers to wait on.

Step 2: Add the additional 12 customers during the lunch rush.
The waiter had 39 customers initially, and then 12 more customers arrived during the lunch rush. To find the total number of customers, I add 39 + 12 = 51.

Step 3: Identify the number of customers who didn't leave a tip.
The problem states that 49 customers didn't leave a tip.

Step 4: Find the total number of customers.
Since we added the 12 customers during the lunch rush, the total number of customers is 51.

Step 5: Subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers.
To find the number of customers who left a tip, I subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip (49) from the total number of customers (51). This gives me:

                     Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve : shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed ; 29 of them by the : time school started, how many did he ; not wash??<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the total number of shirts Sam had to wash.

* Short sleeve shirts: 40
* Long sleeve shirts: 23
* Total shirts: 40 + 23 = 63

Step 2: Identify the number of shirts Sam had washed by the time school started.

* Sam had washed 29 shirts.

Step 3: Subtract the number of shirts Sam had washed from the total number of shirts to find the number of shirts he did not wash.

" A waiter : had 47 customers to wait on. ! If 41 customers left and , he got another 20 customers, how : many customers would he have? ","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     A waiter : had 47 customers to wait on.! If 41 customers left and, he got another 20 customers, how : many customers would he have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: The waiter initially had 47 customers to wait on.

Step 2: 41 customers left, which means the waiter lost 41 customers.

Step 3: To find the number of customers the waiter had left after 41 customers left, we subtract 41 from 47:

47 - 41 = 6

So, the waiter had 6 customers left.

Step 4: Then, he got 20 new customers, which means he gained 20 customers.

Step 5: To find the total number of customers the waiter has now, we add the 6 customers he had left to the 20 new customers he got:

6 + 20 = 26

Step 6: Therefore, the waiter now has a total of 26 customers.
