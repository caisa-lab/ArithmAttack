                    question:
                     Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player initially.

Step 2: She deleted 9 old songs from it. To find the number of songs she has left after deletion, I'll subtract 9 from 11:

11 - 9 = 2

So, Paige has 2 songs left on her mp3 player after deleting 9 old songs.

Step 3: Then, she added 8 new songs to her mp3 player. To find the total number of songs she has now, I'll add 8 to the 2 songs she had left:

2 + 8 = 10

Step 4: Therefore, Paige has 10 songs on her mp3 player after deleting 9 old songs and adding 8 new songs.

{The final answer is 10}<|eot_id|>",10
" There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut? ","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of students trying out for the team.
There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out, so the total number of students is:
39 (girls) + 4 (boys) = 43

Step 2: Identify the number of students who got called back.
Only 26 students got called back, so we know that the remaining students did not make the cut.

Step 3: Find the number of students who did not make the cut.
To do this, we subtract the number of students who got called back (26) from the total number of students trying out (43):
43 (total students) - 26 (students who got called back) = 17

{The final answer is 17 students did not make the cut.}<|eot_id|>",17

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sodas Jerry has.

Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. To find the total number of sodas, we add these two numbers together:

41 (regular sodas) + 22 (diet sodas) = 63 sodas

Step 2: Determine how many sodas Jerry can fit on each shelf.

Jerry's fridge can hold 9 sodas on each shelf.

Step 3: Divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

To find out how many shelves Jerry will need, we divide the total number of sodas (63) by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf (9):

63 ÷ 9 = 7

Step 4: Since Jerry can't fit a fraction of a soda on a shelf, we round up to the nearest whole number.

In this case, we round up 7 to 7, since Jerry can't fit a fraction of a soda on a shelf.

{The final answer is} Jerry will need 7 shelves to store his sodas.<|eot_id|>",7

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of pieces of candy Emily received.

Emily received 5 pieces of candy from her neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister. To find the total number of pieces, we add these amounts together:

5 (from neighbors) + 13 (from older sister) = 18 pieces

Step 2: Determine how many pieces of candy Emily ate per day.

Emily ate 9 pieces of candy per day.

Step 3: Divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces eaten per day.

To find out how many days the candy will last, we divide the total number of pieces (18) by the number of pieces eaten per day (9):

18 ÷ 9 = 2

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of books Mike has to put away.
We know there are 82 books initially, but the librarian takes 10 of them. To find the number of books Mike has left, we subtract 10 from 82:

82 - 10 = 72

So, Mike has 72 books left to put away.

Step 2: Determine how many books Mike can fit on each shelf.
We know Mike can fit 9 books on a shelf.

Step 3: Divide the total number of books Mike has left by the number of books he can fit on each shelf.
To find the number of shelves Mike needs, we divide the total number of books (72) by the number of books he can fit on each shelf (9):

72 ÷ 9 = 8

So, Mike needs 8 shelves to put away the remaining books.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of pictures Nancy took.
Nancy took 49 pictures at the zoo and 8 at the museum. To find the total number of pictures she took initially, we add these two numbers together:

49 + 8 = 57

Step 2: Identify the number of pictures Nancy deleted.
Nancy deleted 38 pictures.

Step 3: Subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of initial pictures.
To find the number of pictures Nancy still has, we subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of initial pictures:

57 - 38 = 19

Step 4: Confirm the answer.
Nancy took 57 pictures initially, deleted 38, and therefore has 19 pictures remaining.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the problem
The problem is to find out how long it will take to install the remaining windows.

Step 2: Determine the number of remaining windows
The builder has already installed 8 windows, and the building needs a total of 14 windows. To find the number of remaining windows, subtract the number of installed windows from the total number of windows:

14 (total windows) - 8 (installed windows) = 6

So, there are 6 remaining windows to be installed.

Step 3: Determine the time taken to install each window
It takes 8 hours to install each window.

Step 4: Calculate the total time taken to install the remaining windows
Since it takes 8 hours to install each window, the total time taken to install the 6 remaining windows can be calculated by multiplying the number of remaining windows by the time taken to install each window:

6 (remaining windows) x 8 (hours per window) = 48 hours

Step 5: State the answer
{The final answer is 48 hours}.<|eot_id|>",48

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The store had 40 oranges initially.

Step 2: They threw away 25 old oranges. To find the number of oranges left after throwing away 25, I'll subtract 25 from the initial 40:

40 - 25 = 15

So, there are 15 oranges left in the bin after throwing away 25 old ones.

Step 3: The store then put 21 new oranges in the bin. To find the total number of oranges in the bin now, I'll add the 15 remaining oranges to the 21 new ones:

15 + 21 = 36

Step 4: Therefore, there are 36 oranges in the bin after throwing away 25 old ones and putting 21 new ones in.

{The final answer is 36.}<|eot_id|>",36

Step 1: Identify the number of customers who didn't leave a tip.
The problem states that 5 out of 7 customers didn't leave a tip. This means that 2 customers did leave a tip.

Step 2: Identify the amount of money earned from the customers who did leave a tip.
The problem states that the waiter received $3 each from the customers who did leave a tip. Since there are 2 customers who did leave a tip, the total amount of money earned from these customers is:

2 customers x $3 each = $6

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money earned.
The waiter didn't earn any money from the 5 customers who didn't leave a tip. However, he earned $6 from the 2 customers who did leave a tip. Therefore, the total amount of money earned is:

$6

The chef already had 9 chicken wings cooked, and cooked 7 more for the group. To find the total number of chicken wings, we add the initial 9 to the additional 7:

9 (initial) + 7 (additional) = 16

Step 2: Determine the total number of chicken wings to be distributed among the 4 friends.
We have a total of 16 chicken wings.

Step 3: Divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends.
To find out how many chicken wings each person will get, we divide the total number of chicken wings (16) by the number of friends (4):

16 ÷ 4 = 4

Step 4: State the answer.
Each person will get 4 chicken wings.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many lawns John actually mowed.
John had 15 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 7 of them. To find out how many lawns he actually mowed, we subtract 7 from 15:

15 - 7 = 8

So, John actually mowed 8 lawns.

Step 2: Calculate how much money John earned for each lawn he mowed.
John earned $8 for each lawn he mowed. Since he mowed 8 lawns, we multiply the number of lawns by the amount earned per lawn:

8 lawns x $8 per lawn = $64

Step 3: Determine how much money John actually earned.
Since John earned $64 for 8 lawns, this is the amount of money he actually earned.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of puppies at the shelter.
The pet shelter had 5 puppies initially.

Step 2: Add the new puppies brought in.
35 more puppies were brought in, so the total number of puppies at the shelter is:
5 (initial puppies) + 35 (new puppies) = 40 puppies

Step 3: Determine the total number of puppies that need to be adopted.
Since 8 puppies are adopted each day, we need to find out how many days it would take to adopt all 40 puppies.

Step 4: Divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted each day.
To find the number of days it would take to adopt all 40 puppies, we divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted each day:
40 puppies ÷ 8 puppies/day = 5 days

Step 5: Check the result.
Since 40 puppies need to be adopted, and 8 puppies are adopted each day, it would take 5 days to adopt all of them.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Identify the problem and understand what's being asked.

The problem asks how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows.

**Step 2:** Calculate the number of windows left to be installed.

The builder has already installed 6 windows, and the building needs 9 windows in total. To find the number of windows left, subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed:

9 (total windows) - 6 (already installed) = 3

**Step 3:** Determine how long it takes to install each window.

It takes 6 hours to install each window.

**Step 4:** Calculate the total time needed to install the remaining windows.

Since it takes 6 hours to install each window, and there are 3 windows left to be installed, multiply the number of windows by the time it takes to install each one:

3 (windows left) × 6 (hours per window) = 18 hours

**Step 5:** Write the final answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of adult meals needed
We know that 13 people came in, and 9 of them were kids. To find the number of adult meals needed, we subtract the number of kids from the total number of people:

13 (total people) - 9 (kids) = 4

So, 4 people need to be served adult meals.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the adult meals
Each adult meal costs $7, and we need to serve 4 adult meals. To find the total cost of the adult meals, we multiply the number of adult meals by the cost per meal:

4 (adult meals) x $7 (cost per meal) = $28

Step 3: The kids eat free, so we don't need to add anything for them
Since the kids eat free, we don't need to add any cost for them.

Step 4: Add the cost of the adult meals to the cost for the kids (which is $0)
To find the total cost for the group, we add the cost of the adult meals to the cost for the kids:

$28 (adult meals) + $0 (kids) = $28

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of math and science problems Paige had for homework.

* Math problems: 43
* Science problems: 12

Step 2: Determine how many problems Paige finished at school.

* She finished 44 problems.

Step 3: Subtract the number of problems Paige finished at school from the total number of math problems she had.

* 43 (initial math problems) - 44 (problems finished at school) =?

To find the correct answer, we need to subtract 44 from 43. However, we can't subtract a larger number from a smaller one. So, we'll subtract 43 from 44 instead.

* 44 - 43 = 1

Step 4: Since we subtracted 1 too many times, we need to add it back to the result.

* 1 + 1 = 2

Step 5: Repeat the process for the science problems.

* Paige had 12 science problems, and she finished 44 problems in total. To find out how many science problems she still needs to do, we subtract the number of science problems she finished at school from the total number of science problems.

* 12 (initial science problems) - 44 (problems finished at school) =?

We can't subtract 44 from 12, so we'll subtract 12 from 44 instead.

* 44 - 12 = 32

Step 6: Paige still needs to do the remaining problems for both math and science.

* Math problems: 2
* Science problems: 32

Step 7: Combine the remaining math and science problems to find the total number of problems Paige needs to do for homework.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The waiter initially had 26 customers to wait on.
Step 2: During the lunch rush, he added another 27 customers. To find the total number of customers, I'll add the initial 26 to the additional 27:

26 (initial customers) + 27 (additional customers) = 53 customers

Step 3: The problem states that 27 customers didn't leave a tip. This means that the number of customers who left a tip is equal to the total number of customers minus the number of customers who didn't leave a tip:

53 (total customers) - 27 (customers who didn't leave a tip) =?

To find the answer, I'll subtract 27 from 53:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of pictures Wendy uploaded to Facebook: 79 pictures

Step 2: Identify the number of pictures Wendy put into one album: 44 pictures

Step 3: Since Wendy put the rest of the pictures into 5 different albums, we need to find the number of pictures left over after putting 44 into one album. To do this, we subtract the number of pictures in the first album (44) from the total number of pictures (79):

79 - 44 = 35 pictures

Step 4: These 35 pictures are the ones that were put into the remaining 5 albums. To find the number of pictures in each album, we divide the total number of pictures left over (35) by the number of albums (5):

35 ÷ 5 = 7 pictures

Step 5: Since Wendy put 44 pictures into the first album, and each of the remaining albums has 7 pictures, we can conclude that each of the 5 remaining albums has:

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of cats in the pet store.
The pet store had 13 Siamese cats and 5 house cats, so the total number of cats initially is:
13 (Siamese cats) + 5 (house cats) = 18 cats

Step 2: Determine how many cats were sold.
The pet store sold 10 cats during the sale.

Step 3: Subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of cats.
To find the number of cats left, subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number:
18 (initial cats) - 10 (cats sold) =?

Step 4: Perform the subtraction.
18 - 10 = 8

Step 5: State the answer.
The pet store has 8 cats left after selling 10 cats.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of cupcakes Megan has left after Todd eats 43.
Megan started with 71 cupcakes and Todd ate 43, so to find the number of cupcakes left, we subtract 43 from 71:

71 - 43 = 28

So, Megan has 28 cupcakes left.

Step 2: Determine the number of packages Megan can make with 7 cupcakes per package.
Since Megan has 28 cupcakes left, we can divide 28 by 7 to find the number of packages she can make:

28 ÷ 7 = 4

So, Megan can make 4 packages of cupcakes.

Step 3: Check the calculation.
To ensure our answer is correct, let's calculate the total number of cupcakes in the 4 packages:

4 packages × 7 cupcakes per package = 28 cupcakes

This matches the number of cupcakes Megan has left, so our answer is correct.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of players and their lives.
There were 2 friends playing the game initially. Each of them had 6 lives, so the total initial lives were:

2 friends × 6 lives per friend = 12 lives

Step 2: Two more players join the game.
These two new players also have 6 lives each, so the total additional lives are:

2 new players × 6 lives per player = 12 lives

Step 3: Combine the initial lives with the additional lives.
To find the total number of lives, we add the initial lives to the additional lives:

12 initial lives + 12 additional lives = 24 lives

Step 4: Confirm the total number of lives.
We can verify our answer by counting the total number of players and their lives:

2 initial friends + 2 new friends = 4 friends
4 friends × 6 lives per friend = 24 lives

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of people going on the field trip
We know that there are 12 students and 3 adults going. To find the total number of people, we add these two numbers together:

12 students + 3 adults = 15 people

Step 2: Determine the capacity of each van
The problem states that each van can hold 5 people.

Step 3: Divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van
To find out how many vans they will need, we divide the total number of people (15) by the capacity of each van (5):

15 people ÷ 5 people per van = 3 vans

Step 4: Check if there are any remaining people
Since we've divided the total number of people by the capacity of each van, we can check if there are any remaining people. In this case, we can see that the result is a whole number (3 vans), which means there are no remaining people.

Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. To find the total number of sodas, we add these two numbers together:

4 (regular sodas) + 52 (diet sodas) = 56 sodas

Step 2: Determine how many sodas Tom can fit on each shelf.

Tom's fridge can hold 7 sodas on each shelf.

Step 3: Divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

To find out how many shelves Tom needs, we divide the total number of sodas (56) by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf (7):

56 ÷ 7 = 8

Step 4: Round up to the nearest whole number (since you can't have a fraction of a shelf).

Tom needs 8 shelves to hold all his sodas.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The school cafeteria had 38 apples initially.

Step 2: They used 20 apples to make lunch for the students. To find the remaining apples, we subtract 20 from 38:

38 - 20 = 18

So, after using 20 apples, the cafeteria has 18 apples left.

Step 3: The cafeteria then bought 28 more apples. To find the total number of apples they have now, we add the 18 apples they had left to the 28 new apples:

18 + 28 = 46

Step 4: Therefore, the school cafeteria now has a total of 46 apples.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of apples left after handing out 42 to students.

Initial number of apples = 96
Apples handed out = 42
Apples left = 96 - 42 = 54

Step 2: Determine how many pies can be made using the remaining apples.

Each pie takes 6 apples, so to find the number of pies that can be made, we can divide the number of apples left by 6.

Apples left = 54
Number of pies = 54 ÷ 6 = 9

Step 3: Verify that we have enough apples to make the calculated number of pies.

Since each pie takes 6 apples, we need to check that we have at least 9 × 6 = 54 apples left to make the pies.

We already know that we have 54 apples left, which is enough to make the calculated 9 pies.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the current number of action figures Henry has.
Henry has 3 action figures.

Step 2: Determine the total number of action figures needed for a complete collection.
Henry needs 8 action figures for a complete collection.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the number of action figures Henry has and the number needed.
To finish his collection, Henry needs to get 8 - 3 = 5 more action figures.

Step 4: Determine the cost of each additional action figure.
Each action figure costs $6.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the additional action figures needed.
Henry needs 5 more action figures, and each one costs $6, so the total cost would be 5 x $6 = $30.

Step 6: Add the cost of the additional action figures to the cost of the action figures Henry already has.
Henry already has 3 action figures, and each one costs $6, so the total cost of the action figures he already has is 3 x $6 = $18. Adding this to the cost of the additional action figures needed, we get $18 + $30 = $48.

Step 3: Subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked
Since only 38 carrots were good, we subtract this number from the total number of carrots picked to find the number of bad carrots:

45 (total carrots picked) - 38 (good carrots) = 7

Step 4: The final answer is

" A worksheet had 7 problems on it. If a teacher had 17 worksheets to grade and had already graded 8 of them, how many more problems does she have to grade? ","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     A worksheet had 7 problems on it. If a teacher had 17 worksheets to grade and had already graded 8 of them, how many more problems does she have to grade?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The teacher has 17 worksheets to grade.
* She has already graded 8 of them.

Step 2: Determine the number of worksheets left to grade

* To find the number of worksheets left to grade, subtract the number of worksheets already graded (8) from the total number of worksheets (17).
* 17 - 8 = 9

Step 3: Determine the total number of problems on the remaining worksheets

* Each worksheet has 7 problems, so the total number of problems on the 9 remaining worksheets is:
* 9 worksheets × 7 problems per worksheet = 63 problems

Step 4: Determine the number of problems left to grade

* The teacher has already graded some problems, but we don't know how many. To find the number of problems left to grade, we subtract the number of problems already graded from the total number of problems on the remaining worksheets.
* Since we don't know the number of problems already graded, we'll use a variable, x, to represent the number of problems already graded.
* The number of problems left to grade is the total number of problems on the remaining worksheets minus the number of problems already graded:
* 63 problems - x =?

Step 5: Determine the number of problems left to grade for each worksheet

* Since each worksheet has 7 problems, the number of problems left to grade for each worksheet is 7.
* We'll use this information to find the number of problems left to grade for each worksheet.

Step 6: Determine the number of problems left to grade for the remaining worksheets

* The teacher has 9 remaining worksheets, and each worksheet has 7 problems. To find the total number of problems left to grade for the remaining worksheets, multiply the number of worksheets by the number of problems per worksheet:
* 9 worksheets × 7 problems per worksheet = 63 problems

Step 7: Determine the number of problems left to grade

* The number of problems left to grade is the total number of problems on the remaining worksheets minus the number of problems already graded:
* 63 problems - x =?

{The final answer is 63 - x, where x represents the number of problems already graded by the teacher.}<|eot_id|>",63

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Isabel uploaded 25 pictures to Facebook.
We know that she put 10 pictures into one album. This means that we need to subtract 10 from the total number of pictures to find out how many pictures are left.

Step 2: Subtract 10 from the total number of pictures.
25 (total pictures) - 10 (pictures in one album) = 15

So, we have 15 pictures left.

Step 3: Isabel put the rest of the pictures into 5 different albums.
Since there are 5 albums, we need to divide the remaining 15 pictures by 5 to find out how many pictures are in each album.

Step 4: Divide the remaining pictures by 5.
15 (remaining pictures) ÷ 5 (number of albums) = 3

So, there are 3 pictures in each of the 5 remaining albums.

Step 5: Add the 10 pictures in the first album to the number of pictures in each of the remaining albums.
To find the total number of pictures in each album, we add the 3 pictures from Step 4 to the 10 pictures in the first album.

Step 1: Identify the problem statement
The problem states that the chef needs to cook 9 potatoes, and he has already cooked 7. This means we need to find the time it takes to cook the remaining potatoes.

Step 2: Calculate the number of potatoes remaining
The chef has already cooked 7 potatoes, and he needs to cook a total of 9 potatoes. To find the number of potatoes remaining, we subtract the number of potatoes already cooked from the total number of potatoes:

9 (total potatoes) - 7 (already cooked) = 2 potatoes remaining

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to cook each potato
The problem states that each potato takes 3 minutes to cook. We can use this information to calculate the time it takes to cook the remaining 2 potatoes.

Step 4: Calculate the time it takes to cook the remaining potatoes
Since each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, we can multiply the number of potatoes remaining by the time it takes to cook each potato:

2 (remaining potatoes) × 3 (minutes per potato) = 6 minutes

Step 5: State the answer
{The final answer is} 6 minutes.

The chef needs 6 more minutes to cook the remaining 2 potatoes.<|eot_id|>",6

Number of puppies adopted per day = 4

Step 4: Calculate the total number of days required to adopt all puppies:

Total number of puppies = 36

Number of days required = Total number of puppies / Number of puppies adopted per day
= 36 / 4
= 9

Step 5: Check the answer:

Since 4 puppies are adopted each day, it would take 9 days for all 36 puppies to be adopted.

                     Paul had saved up 3 dollars. If he received another 7 dollars for his allowance, how many 5 dollar toys could he buy?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Find the total amount of money Paul has saved up.
Paul had saved up 3 dollars initially.

Step 2: Add the allowance money to the total amount.
Paul received an additional 7 dollars for his allowance, so we add this to the initial amount:
3 dollars + 7 dollars = 10 dollars

Step 3: Determine how many 5-dollar toys Paul can buy with the total amount.
To find out how many 5-dollar toys Paul can buy, we divide the total amount by the cost of each toy:
10 dollars ÷ 5 dollars = 2

Step 4: Write the final answer.
Paul can buy 2 5-dollar toys with the total amount of money he has.

                    question:
                     Wendy was playing a video game and had 43 lives. In a hard part of the game she lost 8 lives. If she got 39 more lives in the next level, how many lives would she have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Wendy starts with 43 lives.

Step 2: She loses 8 lives, so we subtract 8 from 43 to find out how many lives she has left:

43 - 8 = 35

Step 3: Wendy gets 39 new lives in the next level. To find out how many lives she now has, we add the 39 new lives to the 35 lives she had left:

35 + 39 = 74

Step 4: Since we want to find out how many lives Wendy has after getting the new lives, we conclude that she now has 74 lives.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Katie had 85 files initially.

Step 2: She deleted 40 files, so we need to subtract 40 from 85 to find the number of files left:

85 - 40 = 45 files left

Step 3: Katie put the remaining 45 files into folders with 5 files in each one. To find the number of folders, we need to divide the number of files left (45) by the number of files in each folder (5):

45 ÷ 5 = 9

Step 4: Since we can't have a fraction of a folder, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, 9.5 becomes 10, but since we're dealing with folders, we'll round down to 9.

{The final answer is 9 folders.}<|eot_id|>",9

Will worked 2 hours on Tuesday, so his earnings on Tuesday would be:
2 hours x $8 per hour = $16

Step 4: Calculate Will's total earnings for the two days
To find Will's total earnings, we add his earnings on Monday and Tuesday:
$64 (Monday) + $16 (Tuesday) = $80

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of members who didn't show up.
The problem states that 7 members didn't show up, which means that the number of members who didn't show up is 7.

Step 2: Identify the number of members who did show up.
Since the total number of members is 14, and 7 didn't show up, the number of members who did show up is:

14 (total members) - 7 (members who didn't show up) = 7

So, 7 members did show up.

Step 3: Identify the number of points each member who showed up scored.
The problem states that each member who showed up scored 5 points.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of points scored by the members who showed up.
Since there are 7 members who showed up, and each scored 5 points, the total number of points scored is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Oliver starts with 46 books, but the librarian takes 10 of them. To find out how many books Oliver is left with, we subtract 10 from 46:

46 - 10 = 36

So, Oliver is left with 36 books.

Step 2: Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf. To find out how many shelves he will need, we need to divide the number of books he has left (36) by the number of books he can fit on a shelf (4).

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away the remaining 36 books.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of piles of each type of coin.

* Luke has 5 piles of quarters.
* Luke has 5 piles of dimes.

Step 2: Determine the number of coins in each pile.

* Each pile of quarters has 3 coins.
* Each pile of dimes has 3 coins.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of coins in each type of coin.

* Quarters: 5 piles x 3 coins per pile = 15 quarters
* Dimes: 5 piles x 3 coins per pile = 15 dimes

Step 4: Add the total number of coins in each type of coin to find the total number of coins.

* Total coins = Quarters + Dimes = 15 quarters + 15 dimes

Step 5: Convert the total number of dimes to a numerical value.

* 15 dimes = 15 x 10 cents (since each dime is worth 10 cents) = 150 cents

Step 6: Convert the total number of quarters to a numerical value.

                     Maria was making baggies of cookies with 8 cookies in each bag. If she had 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of cookies Maria has.

Maria has 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies. To find the total number of cookies, we add these two numbers together:

5 (chocolate chip) + 19 (oatmeal) = 24 cookies

Step 2: Determine the number of cookies per baggie.

Maria is making baggies with 8 cookies in each bag.

Step 3: Divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per baggie.

To find out how many baggies Maria can make, we divide the total number of cookies (24) by the number of cookies per baggie (8):

24 cookies ÷ 8 cookies per baggie = 3 baggies

Step 4: Check the answer.

Since Maria has 24 cookies and each baggie can hold 8 cookies, we can make 3 baggies with the cookies she has.

{The final answer is 3 baggies.}<|eot_id|>",3

The problem states that each flower is $3.

Step 2: Determine the number of flowers Zoe bought
Zoe bought 8 roses and 2 daisies. To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and daisies:

8 roses + 2 daisies = 10 flowers

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the flowers
Since each flower costs $3, we multiply the total number of flowers by the cost of each flower:

10 flowers × $3/flower = $30

Step 4: Write the final answer
{The final answer is $30.}<|eot_id|>",30

                    question:
                     Bianca was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 8 books on it. If she had 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of shelves for each type of book.
We know Bianca has 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books.

Step 2: Determine the number of books on each shelf.
We are told that each shelf has exactly 8 books on it.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of books on the mystery book shelves.
Since there are 5 shelves of mystery books, and each shelf has 8 books, we can multiply the number of shelves by the number of books on each shelf:

5 shelves x 8 books/shelf = 40 books

Step 4: Calculate the total number of books on the picture book shelves.
Similarly, since there are 4 shelves of picture books, and each shelf has 8 books, we can multiply the number of shelves by the number of books on each shelf:

4 shelves x 8 books/shelf = 32 books

Step 5: Add the total number of books on the mystery book shelves and the picture book shelves to find the total number of books.
We add the number of books on the mystery book shelves (40) to the number of books on the picture book shelves (32):

40 books + 32 books = 72 books

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of cards John has to organize.

John has 8 new cards and 16 old cards, so he has a total of:

8 (new cards) + 16 (old cards) = 24 cards

Step 2: Determine how many cards can fit on each page.

The binder has 3 cards on each page.

Step 3: Calculate how many pages John needs to store all his cards.

To find out how many pages John needs, we need to divide the total number of cards (24) by the number of cards that can fit on each page (3).

24 cards ÷ 3 cards per page = 8 pages

Step 4: Check if there are any remaining cards.

Since we've divided the total number of cards by the number of cards per page, we need to check if there are any remaining cards.

In this case, we're left with no remaining cards, as the total number of cards (24) is exactly divisible by the number of cards per page (3).

{The final answer is} 8 pages.<|eot_id|>",8

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial situation
Isabel baked 3 brownies, which means she already has 3 brownies.

Step 2: Determine the total number of brownies needed
According to the problem, Isabel needs 5 brownies for her party. Since she already has 3, she still needs:

5 (total brownies needed) - 3 (brownies she already has) = 2
Isabel needs 2 more brownies.

Step 3: Determine the amount of flour needed for each additional brownie
The problem states that Isabel used 5 cups of flour for each brownie. Since she needs 2 more brownies, she will need:

2 (additional brownies) × 5 (cups of flour per brownie) = 10 cups of flour

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of flour needed
Isabel already used 3 × 5 = 15 cups of flour for the 3 brownies she baked. To find the total amount of flour needed, she will need to add the 10 cups of flour needed for the additional 2 brownies:

15 (cups of flour already used) + 10 (cups of flour needed for additional brownies) = 25 cups of flour

Step 5: Determine how much flour Isabel still needs
Since Isabel needs a total of 5 cups of flour for her party, and she already has 25 cups of flour, she still needs:

5 (total cups of flour needed) - 25 (cups of flour already used) = -20 cups of flour

Wait, what does a negative number mean in this context? It means Isabel has more flour than she needs! She already has 25 cups of flour, which is more than the 5 cups she needs.

{The final answer is} Isabel doesn't need any more flour. She already has enough!<|eot_id|>",10

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Tom bought 40 tickets initially.

Step 2: He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth. This means he has 40 - 28 = 12 tickets left.

Step 3: He wants to know how many rides he can go on using the remaining 12 tickets. Each ride costs 4 tickets.

Step 4: To find out how many rides he can go on, we need to divide the number of remaining tickets (12) by the number of tickets required for one ride (4).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: We know that there were 31 students in fourth grade at the start of the year.

Step 2: During the year, 5 students left. To find the number of students remaining, we subtract 5 from 31:

31 - 5 = 26

So, there are 26 students remaining.

Step 3: During the same year, 11 new students came to school. To find the total number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we add the 11 new students to the 26 remaining students:

26 + 11 = 37

Step 4: Therefore, there were 37 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Maria bought 35 green towels and 21 white towels. To find the total number of towels she has initially, we add these two numbers together:

35 (green towels) + 21 (white towels) = 56 towels

Step 2: Identify the number of towels Maria gave to her mother.
Maria gave her mother 34 towels.

Step 3: Subtract the number of towels given away from the initial total.
To find out how many towels Maria has left, we subtract the number of towels given away (34) from the initial total (56):

56 (initial towels) - 34 (towels given away) = 22 towels

Step 4: Confirm the answer.
Maria ended up with 22 towels after giving 34 away to her mother.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of players on the team.
The school's baseball team has 2 new players and 6 returning players, so the total number of players is:
2 (new players) + 6 (returning players) = 8 players

Step 2: Determine the number of players in each group.
The coach wants to put the players into groups with 4 players in each group.

Step 3: Divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.
To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players (8) by the number of players in each group (4):

8 players ÷ 4 players/group = 2 groups

Step 4: Check the answer.
Since we're dividing the total number of players by the number of players in each group, the answer should be a whole number. In this case, 2 groups makes sense, as we can easily divide the 8 players into two groups of 4 players each.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the number of rooms left to be painted.
The painter has already painted 2 rooms, so there are 6 - 2 = 4 rooms left to be painted.

Step 2: Calculate the total time taken to paint the remaining rooms.
Each room takes 5 hours to paint, so the total time taken to paint the remaining 4 rooms will be:
4 rooms x 5 hours/room = 20 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time taken to paint the rooms already painted.
The painter has already painted 2 rooms, and each room takes 5 hours to paint, so the total time taken to paint these 2 rooms is:
2 rooms x 5 hours/room = 10 hours

Step 4: Calculate the remaining time.
The painter has already taken 10 hours to paint the 2 rooms, and he has 20 hours left to paint the remaining 4 rooms. To find the remaining time, subtract the time taken to paint the already painted rooms from the total time taken to paint the remaining rooms:
20 hours - 10 hours = 10 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The waiter had 22 customers initially. If 14 of them left, how many customers are left?

22 (initial customers) - 14 (customers who left) = 8

So, there are 8 customers left.

Step 2: The problem states that the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table. This means that the 8 customers left are distributed among tables, and each table has 4 people.

Step 3: To find the number of tables, we need to divide the number of customers left (8) by the number of people at each table (4).

8 (customers left) ÷ 4 (people per table) = 2

So, there are 2 tables left.

Step 4: Since the waiter had 22 customers initially, and 14 of them left, the remaining customers are the ones who are distributed among tables. Therefore, the 2 tables we calculated in Step 3 are the ones that have the remaining customers.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Roger is initially given 14 books to put away. However, the librarian takes 2 of them, leaving Roger with the rest.

Let's subtract the 2 books taken by the librarian from the initial 14 books:

14 (initial books) - 2 (books taken by librarian) = 12 books

So, Roger is left with 12 books.

Step 2: Roger can fit 3 books on a shelf. To find out how many shelves he needs, we need to divide the number of books he has left (12) by the number of books he can fit on a shelf (3).

12 (books left) ÷ 3 (books per shelf) = 4

Step 3: Since Roger can fit 3 books on a shelf, and he has 12 books left, he will need 4 shelves to put away all the books.

{The final answer is} 4 shelves.<|eot_id|>",4

                    question:
                     Robin was making baggies of cookies with 6 cookies in each bag. If she had 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of cookies Robin has in total.

Robin has 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies. To find the total number of cookies, I add them together:

23 (chocolate chip) + 25 (oatmeal) = 48 cookies

Step 2: Determine the number of cookies per baggie.

Robin is making baggies with 6 cookies in each bag.

Step 3: Divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per baggie.

To find out how many baggies Robin can make, I divide the total number of cookies (48) by the number of cookies per baggie (6):

48 cookies ÷ 6 cookies per baggie = 8 baggies

Step 4: Check if there are any leftover cookies.

Since Robin can make 8 baggies with 6 cookies in each, she will use up 8 x 6 = 48 cookies, which is the total number of cookies she has. This means she will not have any leftover cookies.

{The final answer is} Robin can make 8 baggies of cookies.<|eot_id|>",8

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1:** Cody had 45 dollars initially.

**Step 2:** He received 9 more dollars as a birthday gift. To find the new total, we add the initial amount to the additional amount:

45 (initial amount) + 9 (additional amount) = 54 dollars

**Step 3:** Cody spent 19 dollars on a new game. To find the new total, we subtract the amount spent from the new total:

54 (new total) - 19 (amount spent) = 35 dollars

**The final answer is:** Cody has 35 dollars now.<|eot_id|>",35

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of pictures Wendy uploaded.
Wendy uploaded 22 pictures from her phone and 2 from her camera, so the total number of pictures is:
22 (phone) + 2 (camera) = 24 pictures

Step 2: Identify the number of albums Wendy created.
Wendy sorted the pictures into 4 different albums.

Step 3: Determine the number of pictures in each album.
Since Wendy wants to put an equal number of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures (24) by the number of albums (4).

24 ÷ 4 = 6

Step 4: Check the answer.
Since we divided the total number of pictures by the number of albums, we can verify that each album has the same number of pictures. In this case, each album has 6 pictures.

Katie and her sister combined their candy, so we add their amounts together:

8 (Katie's candy) + 23 (sister's candy) = 31

Step 3: Determine how many pieces of candy they ate the first night.

They ate 8 pieces of candy the first night.

Step 4: Subtract the number of pieces eaten from the total amount of candy.

To find out how many pieces of candy they have left, we subtract the number of pieces eaten from the total amount:

31 (total candy) - 8 (pieces eaten) =?

Step 5: Perform the subtraction.

31 - 8 = 23

The problem states that the pet store sold 34 puppies.

Step 2: Determine the number of puppies remaining after the sale.

The pet store had 88 puppies initially and sold 34. To find the number of puppies remaining, subtract the number sold from the initial number:

88 - 34 = 54

So, there are 54 puppies remaining.

Step 3: Determine the number of puppies per cage (6).

The problem states that the remaining puppies are put into cages with 6 puppies in each cage.

Step 4: Determine the number of cages needed.

To find the number of cages needed, divide the number of remaining puppies (54) by the number of puppies per cage (6):

54 ÷ 6 = 9

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of trays Jerry needs to pick up from each table.

* Table 1: 9 trays
* Table 2: 7 trays

Step 2: Calculate the total number of trays Jerry needs to pick up.

* 9 trays (Table 1) + 7 trays (Table 2) = 16 trays

Step 3: Determine how many trays Jerry can carry on each trip.

* Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time.

Step 4: Calculate how many trips Jerry will need to make to pick up all the trays.

* Jerry needs to pick up 16 trays, but he can only carry 8 trays at a time. To find out how many trips he'll need, we'll divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry on each trip.
* 16 trays ÷ 8 trays/trip = 2 trips

Step 5: Check if Jerry has enough capacity to pick up all the trays on the last trip.

* Jerry needs to pick up 2 trays (16 trays - 8 trays = 2 trays) on the last trip, which is within his capacity of carrying 8 trays.

Conclusion: Jerry will make 2 trips to pick up all the trays.

Will made $104 and spent $41 on new mower blades. To find out how much money he had left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he made:

$104 (initial amount) - $41 (amount spent) = $63

So, Will has $63 left after buying new mower blades.

Step 2: Determine how many 9-dollar games he could buy with the money he has left.

Since each game costs $9, we can divide the amount of money Will has left ($63) by the cost of each game ($9) to find out how many games he can buy:

$63 ÷ $9 = 7

So, Will can buy 7 games with the money he has left.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the problem statement
The problem states that April's discount flowers is having a sale where each flower is $3.

Step 2: Identify the question being asked
The question being asked is how much did Emily spend on the flowers.

Step 3: Identify the number of flowers Emily bought
Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies. Since each flower costs $3, we need to calculate the total cost of the flowers.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the roses
Emily bought 2 roses, and each rose costs $3. To calculate the total cost of the roses, we multiply the number of roses by the cost of each rose:

2 roses x $3/rose = $6

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the daisies
Emily bought 2 daisies, and each daisy also costs $3. To calculate the total cost of the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the cost of each daisy:

2 daisies x $3/daisy = $6

Step 6: Calculate the total cost of the flowers
To calculate the total cost of the flowers, we add the cost of the roses and the cost of the daisies:

$6 (roses) + $6 (daisies) = $12

Step 7: The final answer is
Emily spent a total of $12 on the flowers.<|eot_id|>",12

                    question:
                     A pet store had 13 puppies. In one day they sold 7 of them and put the rest into cages with 2 in each cage. How many cages did they use?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of puppies left after selling 7.

Initial number of puppies: 13
Number of puppies sold: 7
Number of puppies left: 13 - 7 = 6

Step 2: Determine the number of puppies left after putting them into cages.

Number of puppies left: 6
Cage capacity: 2 puppies per cage

To find the number of cages needed, divide the number of puppies left by the cage capacity:

6 ÷ 2 = 3

Step 3: Determine the total number of cages needed.

Since we need to put all the remaining puppies into cages, we need 3 cages (since 6 puppies can fit into 3 cages with 2 puppies per cage).

{The final answer is} 3<|eot_id|>",3
" Faye and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Faye picked 23 and her mother picked 5. If only 12 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have? ","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Faye picked 23 carrots and her mother picked 5 carrots.

Step 2: Combine the number of carrots picked by Faye and her mother.
Faye picked 23 carrots and her mother picked 5 carrots, so in total, they picked 23 + 5 = 28 carrots.

Step 3: Identify the number of good carrots.
We are told that only 12 of the carrots were good.

Step 4: Subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots to find the number of bad carrots.
To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots:
28 (total carrots) - 12 (good carrots) = 16

Step 5: Determine the number of bad carrots.
The result of the subtraction in Step 4 is 16, which means that Faye and her mother have 16 bad carrots.

{The final answer is 16 bad carrots.}<|eot_id|>",16

Step 3: Subtract the number of wilted flowers from the original number of flowers to find the new total number of flowers available:

66 (original flowers) - 10 (wilted flowers) = 56

Step 4: Identify the number of flowers needed for each bouquet, which is 8.

Step 5: Divide the new total number of flowers (56) by the number of flowers needed for each bouquet (8) to find the number of bouquets Isabel can still make:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Step 6: Since Isabel can make 7 bouquets with 8 flowers each, she can still make {The final answer is} **7 bouquets**.<|eot_id|>",7

Each ride of the ferris wheel and bumper cars costs 7 tickets.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tickets used for the ferris wheel rides.
Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times, and each ride costs 7 tickets. To find the total number of tickets used, multiply the number of rides by the cost per ride:
5 rides x 7 tickets per ride = 35 tickets

Step 4: Calculate the total number of tickets used for the bumper cars.
Oliver rode the bumper cars 4 times, and each ride costs 7 tickets. To find the total number of tickets used, multiply the number of rides by the cost per ride:
4 rides x 7 tickets per ride = 28 tickets

Step 5: Add the total number of tickets used for the ferris wheel rides and the bumper cars.

Wendy bought 4 new chairs and 4 new tables. To find the total number of pieces, we add the number of chairs and tables:

4 chairs + 4 tables = 8 pieces of furniture

Step 2: Determine how many minutes Wendy spent on each piece of furniture.

Wendy spent 6 minutes on each piece of furniture putting it together.

Step 3: Multiply the number of pieces by the number of minutes spent on each piece.

To find the total time spent putting together all the furniture, we multiply the number of pieces by the number of minutes spent on each piece:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Ned bought 50 games from a friend.
Step 2: He bought 27 more games at a garage sale.
Step 3: To find the total number of games Ned bought, we add the two numbers together: 50 + 27 = 77

So, Ned bought a total of 77 games.

Step 4: 74 of the games didn't work. This means that Ned has 77 - 74 = 3 games that didn't work.

Step 5: To find the number of good games Ned has, we subtract the number of non-working games from the total number of games: 77 - 3 = 74

Step 6: However, this answer is incorrect because it includes the 74 games that didn't work. We need to subtract the non-working games from the total number of games before we can find the number of good games.

Step 7: So, we need to subtract the 74 non-working games from the total number of games before we can find the number of good games. This gives us: 77 - 74 = 3

                     A waiter had 47 customers to wait on. If 41 customers left and he got another 20 customers, how many customers would he have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The waiter initially had 47 customers to wait on.

Step 2: 41 customers left. To find out how many customers are left, we subtract 41 from 47:

47 - 41 = 6

So, the waiter has 6 customers left.

Step 3: The waiter gets 20 new customers. To find out how many customers he has in total now, we add the 6 customers he had left to the 20 new customers:

6 + 20 = 26

The final answer is:
{The final answer is 26 customers.}<|eot_id|>",26
