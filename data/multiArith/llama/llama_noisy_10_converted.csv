Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Paige? had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from? it and then added 8 new songs, how many songs! does she have on her mp3? player?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Paige had 11 songs initially.
Let's represent the number of songs Paige had initially as x. Since she had 11 songs, we can set up the equation:

x = 11

Step 2: Paige deleted 9 old songs.
After deleting the old songs, Paige has:

x - 9 =?

We subtract 9 from the initial number of songs to find the new number of songs. Since x = 11, we can substitute this value into the equation:

11 - 9 = 2

So, Paige has 2 songs left after deleting the old ones.

Step 3: Paige added 8 new songs.
After adding the new songs, Paige now has:

2 + 8 =?

We add the 8 new songs to the remaining 2 songs to find the new total.

2 + 8 = 10

Step 4: The final number of songs.
The final number of songs Paige has on her mp3 player is 10.

{The final answer is 10.}<|eot_id|>",10,10.0,10.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of students trying out for the basketball team.

We are given that there are 39 girls and 4 boys trying out. To find the total number of students, we add these two numbers together:

39 (girls) + 4 (boys) = 43

Step 2: Identify the number of students who got called back.

We are given that 26 students got called back. This means that 26 students were selected for the team.

Step 3: Identify the number of students who did not get called back.

To find the number of students who did not get called back, we subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students trying out:

43 (total students) - 26 (students who got called back) = 17

Step 4: The final answer is the number of students who did not get called back.

{The final answer is 17 students did not make the cut.}<|eot_id|>",17,17.0,17.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The school cafeteria starts with 23 apples.

Step 2: They use 20 apples to make lunch for the students. To find out how many apples they have left, we need to subtract 20 from 23:

23 - 20 = 3

So, after using 20 apples, they have 3 apples left.

Step 3: The school cafeteria then buys 6 more apples. To find out how many apples they have now, we add 6 to the 3 they had left:

3 + 6 = 9

Therefore, the school cafeteria now has 9 apples.

{The final answer is 9 apples}.<|eot_id|>",9,9.0,9.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of enemies defeated.
We know that there are 11 enemies in total, and you destroy all but 3 of them. To find the number of enemies defeated, we subtract the number of enemies left (3) from the total number of enemies (11):

11 - 3 = 8

So, you defeat 8 enemies.

Step 2: Calculate the points earned per enemy.
According to the problem, each enemy defeated gives you 9 points. Since you defeat 8 enemies, we multiply the number of enemies defeated by the points earned per enemy:

8 x 9 = 72

Step 3: Calculate the total points earned.
Since you earn 9 points per enemy, and you defeat 8 enemies, the total points earned would be:

72 points

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
- Megan earns 8 points for each bag of cans she recycles.
- She had 14 bags of cans, but didn't recycle 5 of them.

Step 2: Calculate the number of bags Megan recycled.
- Since she didn't recycle 5 bags, she must have recycled the remaining bags.
- Let's subtract 5 from 14 to find the number of bags she recycled: 14 - 5 = 9 bags

Step 3: Calculate the total points Megan earned.
- Since she recycled 9 bags, she earned points for each of those bags.
- Multiply the number of bags she recycled (9) by the points she earns per bag (8): 9 x 8 = 72 points

Step 4: Check the answer.
- Make sure the answer makes sense in the context of the problem. In this case, it does - Megan earned 72 points for recycling 9 bags.

April started with 13 roses.

Step 2: Identify the number of roses April had left.
April had 4 roses left.

Step 3: Calculate the number of roses April sold.
To find the number of roses April sold, subtract the number of roses left from the initial number of roses:
13 (initial roses) - 4 (roses left) = 9 roses

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money April earned.
Since each rose was $4, multiply the number of roses sold by the price of each rose:
9 roses x $4/rose = $36

Step 5: Determine the amount of money April earned.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of shirts Ned had to wash.
Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts. To find the total number of shirts, I add these two numbers together:
9 + 21 = 30

Step 2: Identify the number of shirts Ned had already washed.
Ned had washed 29 shirts by the time school started.

Step 3: Subtract the number of shirts Ned had already washed from the total number of shirts to find the number of shirts he did not wash.
To do this, I subtract 29 from 30:
30 - 29 = 1

" A company invited , 47 people to a luncheon, but 7 of them didn't show up. If the tables they ; had held 5 people each, how many tables do they need? ","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     A company invited, 47 people to a luncheon, but 7 of them didn't show up. If the tables they ; had held 5 people each, how many tables do they need?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the number of people who actually showed up for the luncheon.
Since 7 people didn't show up, we need to subtract 7 from the original number of invitations (47).

47 (original invitations) - 7 (no-shows) = 40 people who actually showed up.

Step 2: Determine the number of tables needed.
Each table can hold 5 people, so we need to divide the number of people who showed up (40) by the capacity of each table (5).

40 people ÷ 5 people per table = 8 tables

Step 3: Check if the result makes sense.
It's reasonable to assume that 8 tables can accommodate 40 people, considering each table can hold 5 people.

Step 4: Confirm the answer.
Based on the calculations, we need 8 tables to accommodate the 40 people who actually showed up.

{The final answer is 8 tables.}<|eot_id|>",8,8.0,8.0
" Tom had 5 books. If he , sold 4 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Tom have? ","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Tom starts with 5 books.

Step 2: He sells 4 of them. To find out how many books he has left, we subtract 4 from 5:

5 - 4 = 1

So, Tom has 1 book left after selling 4.

Step 3: Tom uses the money he earned from selling the 4 books to buy 38 new books. This means he adds 38 new books to the 1 book he has left.

Step 4: To find the total number of books Tom has now, we add the 1 book he had left to the 38 new books:

1 + 38 = 39

Therefore, Tom has 39 books now.

{The final answer is 39 books.}<|eot_id|>",39,39.0,39.0

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sodas Jerry bought.
Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. To find the total number of sodas, I add these two numbers together:

41 (regular sodas) + 22 (diet sodas) = 63 sodas

Step 2: Determine how many sodas can fit on each shelf.
Jerry's fridge can hold 9 sodas on each shelf.

Step 3: Divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.
To find out how many shelves Jerry needs, I divide the total number of sodas (63) by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf (9):

63 ÷ 9 = 7

Step 4: Round up to the nearest whole number, since you can't have a fraction of a shelf.
Since Jerry can't have a fraction of a shelf, I round up to the nearest whole number:

7.0 → 7

{The final answer is 7 shelves}.<|eot_id|>",7,7.0,7.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial amount of candy Debby and her sister have.
Debby has 32 pieces of candy.
Her sister has 42 pieces of candy.
To find the total amount of candy they have initially, we add these two amounts together:
32 (Debby's candy) + 42 (sister's candy) = 74 pieces of candy

Step 2: Determine how many pieces of candy they ate the first night.
They ate 35 pieces of candy.

Step 3: Find the remaining candy by subtracting the amount eaten from the initial total.
We subtract 35 (pieces eaten) from 74 (initial total):
74 - 35 = 39

Step 4: Since Debby and her sister are sharing the candy, we need to find the remaining candy for both of them.
Since they ate 35 pieces together, they will have 39 pieces remaining (from Step 3).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Emily started with 41 seeds and planted 29 of them in the big garden. This means she has 41 - 29 = 12 seeds left.

Step 2: Emily put 4 seeds in each of her small gardens. Since she has 12 seeds left, we can divide 12 by 4 to find out how many small gardens she has:

12 ÷ 4 = 3

So, Emily has 3 small gardens.

Step 3: We need to find out how many small gardens Emily has. Since we already calculated that she has 3 small gardens, we can conclude that this is the correct answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total amount of candy Emily received.
Emily received 5 pieces from her neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister. To find the total amount of candy, we add these two amounts together:

5 pieces (from neighbors) + 13 pieces (from older sister) = 18 pieces

So, Emily received a total of 18 pieces of candy.

Step 2: Determine how many pieces of candy Emily eats per day.
Emily eats 9 pieces of candy per day.

Step 3: Calculate the number of days the candy will last.
To find the number of days the candy will last, we divide the total amount of candy (18 pieces) by the number of pieces Emily eats per day (9 pieces):

18 pieces ÷ 9 pieces/day = 2 days

So, the candy will last Emily for 2 days.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Mike is left with the rest of the books after the librarian takes 10 away. To find out how many books Mike is left with, we subtract 10 from the total number of books:

82 (total books) - 10 (books taken by librarian) = 72

So, Mike is left with 72 books.

Step 2: Mike can fit 9 books on a shelf. To find out how many shelves he needs, we need to divide the number of books he has left by the number of books he can fit on a shelf:

72 (books Mike has left) ÷ 9 (books per shelf) = 8

So, Mike needs 8 shelves to put away all the books.

{The final answer is 8 shelves.}<|eot_id|>",8,8.0,8.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of windows left to be installed.
The builder has already installed 8 windows, and the building needs a total of 14 windows. To find the number of windows left to be installed, subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed:

14 (total windows) - 8 (windows already installed) = 6

{Step 1 result: 6 windows left to be installed}

Step 2: Determine the time taken to install one window.
According to the problem, it takes 8 hours to install one window.

{Step 2 result: 8 hours per window}

Step 3: Calculate the time taken to install the remaining windows.
Since there are 6 windows left to be installed, and it takes 8 hours to install one window, multiply the number of windows by the time taken to install one window:

6 (windows left to be installed) × 8 (hours per window) = 48 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of chicken wings cooked by the chef.
The chef had 9 chicken wings cooked initially, and then cooked 7 more. To find the total number of chicken wings cooked, we add the initial 9 to the additional 7:

9 (initial) + 7 (additional) = 16

Step 2: Identify the number of friends in the group.
There are 4 friends in the group.

Step 3: Divide the total number of chicken wings cooked by the number of friends.
To find out how many chicken wings each friend will get, we divide the total number of chicken wings cooked (16) by the number of friends (4):

We know that 9 out of the 13 people are kids, which means the remaining 4 people are adults.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the adult meals.
Since each adult meal costs $7, the total cost of the adult meals would be:

4 adults × $7 per adult = $28

Step 3: Determine the cost of the kids' meals.
Since kids eat free, the cost of the kids' meals is $0.

Step 4: Add the cost of the adult meals and the cost of the kids' meals.

* We know that 44 pictures were put into one album. This leaves us with:
79 (total pictures) - 44 (pictures in one album) = 35 pictures remaining

Step 2: The rest of the pictures (35) were put into 5 different albums.

* Since there are 5 albums, we can divide the remaining 35 pictures by 5 to find the number of pictures in each album:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of students on the debate team.
The problem states that there are 0.5 boys and 40 girls, but it doesn't specify the total number of students. Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll assume that the 0.5 boys means there are 5 boys (not 0.5 boys). Therefore, the total number of students is:
5 boys + 40 girls = 45 students

Step 2: Determine the number of groups of 9 students that can be formed.
To find the number of groups, we'll divide the total number of students (45) by the number of students in each group (9):

45 students ÷ 9 students/group = 5 groups

Step 3: Check if there are any remaining students.
Since we've divided the total number of students by the number of students in each group, we need to check if there are any remaining students.

45 students (total) - 45 students (divided into groups) = 0 remaining students

Since there are no remaining students, we can conclude that the debate team can be split into exactly 5 groups of 9 students each.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of cats.
The pet store had 13 Siamese cats and 5 house cats. To find the total number of cats, I add these two numbers together:

13 (Siamese cats) + 5 (house cats) = 18 cats

Step 2: Determine the number of cats sold.
The pet store sold 10 cats during the sale.

Step 3: Subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats.
To find the number of cats left, I subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats:

18 (total cats) - 10 (cats sold) = 8 cats

Step 4: Check the answer.
I have 8 cats left.

{The final answer is 8 cats}.<|eot_id|>",8,8.0,8.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of cupcakes Megan has.
Megan baked 71 cupcakes.

Step 2: Identify the number of cupcakes Todd ate.
Todd ate 43 cupcakes.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cupcakes Megan has left after Todd ate some.
To do this, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes Todd ate from the initial number of cupcakes Megan had.
71 (initial cupcakes) - 43 (cupcakes Todd ate) = 28

Step 4: Determine how many packages Megan can make with the remaining cupcakes.
Each package contains 7 cupcakes. To find out how many packages Megan can make, we need to divide the number of remaining cupcakes by 7.

28 (remaining cupcakes) ÷ 7 (cupcakes per package) = 4

Step 5: Determine the number of packages Megan can make.
Since we can fit 7 cupcakes in each package, and we have 28 remaining cupcakes, we can make 4 packages.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of flowers Wendy has after the wilted flowers are removed.

Wendy started with 103 flowers, and 47 wilted. To find the remaining flowers, we subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total:

103 - 47 = 56

{Step 1 result: 56 flowers remain}

Step 2: Determine the number of flowers needed for each bouquet.

Each bouquet requires 8 flowers. To find the total number of flowers needed for all bouquets, we multiply the number of bouquets by 8:

Number of bouquets x 8 flowers per bouquet = Total flowers needed

We don't know the number of bouquets yet, but we'll get to that later. For now, let's focus on the total flowers needed.

Step 3: Divide the remaining flowers by the flowers needed per bouquet.

We want to find the maximum number of bouquets Wendy can make with the remaining flowers. To do this, we divide the remaining flowers (56) by the flowers needed per bouquet (8):

56 ÷ 8 =?

Step 4: Calculate the result.

56 ÷ 8 = 7

{Step 4 result: Wendy can make 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers}

Step 5: Determine the number of bouquets Wendy can make.

We know Wendy can make 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers (56). However, we need to ensure we're not making bouquets with fewer than 8 flowers. Since Wendy is making bouquets with 8 flowers each, we can make a maximum of 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of people going on the field trip.

* There are 12 students going.
* There are 3 adults going.

To find the total number of people, I add the number of students and adults:

12 students + 3 adults = 15 people

Step 2: Determine the capacity of each van.

* Each van can hold 5 people.

Step 3: Divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van.

* 15 people (total) ÷ 5 people (per van) =?

To divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van, I perform the division:

15 ÷ 5 = 3

Step 4: Determine the number of vans needed.

* Since 15 people can fit into 3 vans (with 5 people per van), we need at least 3 vans to accommodate everyone.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of sodas Tom bought.
Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. To find the total number of sodas, we add these two numbers together:

4 (regular sodas) + 52 (diet sodas) = 56 sodas

Step 2: Determine the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.
The fridge can hold 7 sodas on each shelf.

Step 3: Divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf to find the number of shelves needed.
To do this, we'll divide the total number of sodas (56) by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf (7):

56 ÷ 7 = 8

Step 4: Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we'll round up to the nearest whole number.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of trays Luke needs to pick up.
Luke needs to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another. To find the total number of trays, we add these two numbers together:

20 + 16 = 36

Step 2: Determine how many trays Luke can carry on each trip.
Luke can only carry 4 trays at a time. This means that each trip, he can pick up a maximum of 4 trays.

Step 3: Calculate how many trips Luke will need to make to pick up all the trays.
To find the number of trips, we divide the total number of trays (36) by the number of trays Luke can carry on each trip (4):

36 ÷ 4 = 9

Step 4: Check if there are any remaining trays.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the number of action figures Henry needs to complete his collection.
Henry already has 3 action figures, but he needs a total of 8 for a complete collection. To find out how many more he needs, I'll subtract the number he has from the total number he needs:

8 (total needed) - 3 (number he has) = 5

Henry needs 5 more action figures to complete his collection.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the action figures he needs to buy.
Each action figure costs $6, and Henry needs 5 more. To find the total cost, I'll multiply the number of action figures he needs to buy by the cost of each one:

5 (number of action figures needed) × $6 (cost of each one) = $30

Henry needs to spend $30 to buy the remaining 5 action figures to complete his collection.

We know that 23 managers and 7 employees are participating. To find the total number of people, we add these two numbers together:

23 (managers) + 7 (employees) = 30

So, there are a total of 30 people participating in the game.

Step 2: Determine the number of teams.

The problem states that they will split into 6 teams. This means we need to divide the total number of people (30) by the number of teams (6) to find the number of people on each team.

Step 3: Divide the total number of people by the number of teams.

30 (total people) ÷ 6 (number of teams) =?

Step 1: Identify the total number of brownies needed for the party.
The problem states that Tiffany needs 17 brownies in total.

Step 2: Identify the number of brownies she has already baked.
The problem states that she baked 8 brownies.

Step 3: Calculate the number of brownies she still needs to bake.
To find out how many brownies she still needs to bake, subtract the number of brownies she has already baked from the total number of brownies needed:
17 (total needed) - 8 (already baked) = 9

Step 4: Calculate the total cups of flour needed for the remaining brownies.
Since she uses 8 cups of flour for each brownie, and she needs to bake 9 more brownies, she will need:
9 (remaining brownies) x 8 (cups of flour per brownie) = 72 cups of flour

Step 5: Calculate the cups of flour she still needs.
Since she already used 8 cups of flour for each of the 8 brownies she baked, she has already used a total of:
8 (cups of flour per brownie) x 8 (brownies) = 64 cups of flour

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given
We know that Carol picked 29 carrots and her mother picked 16 carrots. We also know that only 38 of the carrots were good.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of carrots picked
To find the total number of carrots picked, we add the number of carrots picked by Carol (29) and her mother (16):

29 + 16 = 45

So, Carol and her mom picked a total of 45 carrots.

Step 3: Identify the number of good carrots
We know that only 38 of the carrots were good.

Step 4: Calculate the number of bad carrots
To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the number of good carrots (38) from the total number of carrots picked (45):

45 - 38 = 7

So, Carol and her mom had 7 bad carrots.

The teacher has 17 worksheets to grade.

Step 2: Identify the number of worksheets the teacher has already graded.
The teacher has already graded 8 worksheets.

Step 3: Subtract the number of worksheets already graded from the total number of worksheets to find the number of worksheets left to grade.
17 (total worksheets) - 8 (already graded) = 9

Step 4: Since each worksheet has 7 problems, multiply the number of worksheets left to grade by 7 to find the total number of problems left to grade.
9 (workheets left to grade) x 7 (problems per worksheet) = 63

2 more players joined the game, so the total number of players is:
8 (initial players) + 2 (new players) = 10

Step 3: Identify the number of lives each player has.
Each player has 6 lives.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of lives.
Since there are 10 players, we need to multiply the number of lives each player has by the total number of players:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Cody starts with 49 tickets.

Step 2: He spends 25 tickets on a beanie. To find out how many tickets he has left, we subtract 25 from 49:

49 - 25 = 24

So, Cody has 24 tickets left.

Step 3: Later, Cody wins 6 more tickets. To find out how many tickets he now has, we add 6 to the 24 tickets he had left:

24 + 6 = 30

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Bianca received 78 pieces of candy. She ate 30 pieces, so we need to subtract 30 from 78 to find out how many pieces of candy she has left.

78 (initial number of pieces) - 30 (pieces eaten) = 48

So, Bianca has 48 pieces of candy left.

Step 2: She wants to place the remaining pieces into piles, with 8 pieces in each pile. To find out how many piles she can make, we need to divide the number of remaining pieces (48) by 8.

48 ÷ 8 =?

To divide 48 by 8, we can start by dividing 40 by 8 (since 48 is greater than 40, but we can still divide 40 by 8 to get an idea of how many piles she can make).

40 ÷ 8 = 5

Since 48 is greater than 40, we know that the actual number of piles will be greater than 5. To find the exact number, we can divide the remaining pieces (48) by 8 again:

48 ÷ 8 = 6

So, Bianca can make 6 piles with 8 pieces in each pile.

There are 11 people in the group, and 2 of them are kids. This means that 9 of them are adults, since 2 are kids.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of adult meals
Each adult meal costs $8, and there are 9 adults. To find the total cost of adult meals, multiply the number of adults by the cost of each meal:

9 adults × $8/adult = $72

Step 3: Determine the cost of kids' meals
Since kids eat free, the cost of kids' meals is $0.

Step 4: Add the cost of adult meals and kids' meals

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Roger starts with 25 books.
Initial number of books = 25

Step 2: He sells 21 books.
Number of books sold = 21

Step 3: Roger earns money from selling the books.
Let's assume he earns x amount of money from selling the books.

Step 4: He uses the money he earned to buy 30 new books.
Number of new books bought = 30

Step 5: To find the total number of books Roger has now, we need to subtract the number of books sold from the initial number of books, and then add the number of new books bought.
Total number of books = Initial number of books - Number of books sold + Number of new books bought
= 25 - 21 + 30
= 4 + 30

$19 (initial amount) - $11 (amount spent) = $8

So, Frank has $8 left.

Step 3: The problem asks how many 2-dollar games Frank could buy with the money he has left.
To find the answer, we need to divide the amount of money Frank has left ($8) by the cost of each game ($2).

80 (initial files) - 31 (files deleted) = 49 files left

Step 2: Nancy put the remaining 49 files into folders with 7 files in each folder. To find out how many folders she has, we need to divide the number of files left (49) by the number of files in each folder (7).

49 files left ÷ 7 files per folder = 7 folders

Here's the step-by-step solution to the problem:

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Mike has earned.
Mike earned $14 from mowing lawns and $26 from weed eating. To find the total amount, I add these two amounts together:

$14 + $26 = $40

So, Mike has a total of $40.

Step 2: Calculate the weekly expense.
Mike spends $5 per week. To find the total amount he spends in a given period, I multiply the weekly expense by the number of weeks.

Let's say the period is x weeks. Then, Mike spends:

$5 x weeks = $5x

Step 3: Set up an equation to represent the situation.
Let's say the period is x weeks. Since Mike's money will last for x weeks, the amount of money he has left at the end of the period will be 0. We can set up an equation:

$40 - $5x = 0

Step 4: Solve for x.
To solve for x, I can add $5x to both sides of the equation:

$40 = $5x

Then, I can divide both sides by $5:

$x = $40 ÷ $5

$x = 8

So, the money will last Mike for 8 weeks.

{The final answer is 8 weeks.}<|eot_id|>",8,8.0,8.0

9 (short sleeve shirts) + 27 (long sleeve shirts) = 36 shirts

Step 2: Determine how many shirts Dave washed by the time school started.
Dave washed 20 shirts by the time school started. This means that he has not yet washed the remaining shirts.

Step 3: Find the number of shirts Dave did not wash.
To find the number of shirts Dave did not wash, we subtract the number of shirts he washed (20) from the total number of shirts he had to wash (36):

36 (total shirts) - 20 (shirts washed) = 16

Therefore, Dave did not wash 16 shirts by the time school started.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of potatoes that need to be cooked.
The chef needs to cook 9 potatoes, but he has already cooked 7. To find the number of potatoes that need to be cooked, subtract the number of potatoes already cooked from the total number of potatoes:

9 (total potatoes) - 7 (potatoes already cooked) = 2 potatoes

Step 2: Determine the time it takes to cook each potato.
Each potato takes 3 minutes to cook.

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to cook the remaining potatoes.
Since there are 2 potatoes left to cook, multiply the number of potatoes by the time it takes to cook each potato:

2 potatoes x 3 minutes/potato = 6 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of puppies at the shelter.
The pet shelter had 2 puppies initially.

Step 2: Add the new puppies brought in.
The shelter received 34 new puppies, so the total number of puppies now is:
2 (initial) + 34 (new) = 36 puppies

Step 3: Determine the total number of puppies that need to be adopted.
Since all puppies need to be adopted, the total number of puppies that need to be adopted is:
36 puppies

Step 4: Determine the rate at which puppies are being adopted.
Puppies are being adopted at a rate of 4 puppies per day.

Step 5: Calculate the time it would take to adopt all puppies.
To find the time it would take to adopt all puppies, we need to divide the total number of puppies by the rate at which they are being adopted:
Time = Total number of puppies / Rate of adoption
= 36 puppies / 4 puppies per day
= 9 days

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Victor bought 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books. We also know that 16 of the books were used.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of books bought.
To find the total number of books bought, we need to add the number of adventure books and mystery books:
32 (adventure books) + 37 (mystery books) = 69 books

Step 3: Subtract the number of used books from the total number of books bought.
Since 16 books were used, we need to subtract this number from the total number of books bought to find the number of new books bought:
69 (total books) - 16 (used books) = 53

Step 4: Check the answer.
We need to make sure that the answer makes sense in the context of the problem. It seems reasonable that Victor would have bought at least some new books, so 53 new books seems like a plausible answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate Jerry's total earnings
Jerry made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 31 dollars weed eating, so his total earnings are:
14 + 31 = 45 dollars

Step 2: Calculate Jerry's weekly expenses
Jerry spends 5 dollars a week, so his weekly expenses are:
5 dollars

Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks Jerry's money will last
To find out how long Jerry's money will last, we need to divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses. We can do this by dividing 45 (his total earnings) by 5 (his weekly expenses):
45 ÷ 5 = 9 weeks

Step 4: Verify the answer
Since Jerry's money will last for 9 weeks, we can verify this by calculating how much money he'll have left after 9 weeks:
45 (total earnings) - (9 weeks x 5 dollars/week) = 45 - 45 = 0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Adam starts with 33 books.

Step 2: He sells 11/10 of his books (note: 11/10 is the same as 1.1, or 11 out of every 10 books).

To find out how many books he sells, multiply 33 by 0.11 (since 11/10 is the same as 0.11):

33 x 0.11 = 3.63 (round down to 3, since you can't sell a fraction of a book)

So, Adam sells 3 books.

Step 3: After selling the books, Adam is left with:

33 - 3 = 30 books

Step 4: Adam uses the money he earned from selling the books to buy 23 new books.

Step 5: Add the 23 new books to the 30 books Adam had left after selling:

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Kaleb collected cans on Saturday and Sunday. Let's break down the information we have:

* On Saturday, he filled 5 bags.
* On Sunday, he filled 5 more bags.

**Step 2:** Each bag has 4 cans in it. So, we need to calculate the total number of cans in each day's collection.

* Saturday: 5 bags x 4 cans/bag = 5 x 4 = 20 cans
* Sunday: 5 bags x 4 cans/bag = 5 x 4 = 20 cans

**Step 3:** Now, we need to add the total number of cans collected on both days.

* Total cans collected on Saturday: 20 cans

* 2 shelves of mystery books
* 6 shelves of picture books

Step 2: Determine how many books are on each shelf.
For the mystery books, each shelf has exactly 6 books, so:
* 2 shelves of mystery books = 2 x 6 = 12 books

For the picture books, each shelf has exactly 6 books, so:
* 6 shelves of picture books = 6 x 6 = 36 books

Step 3: Add up the total number of books.
We have 12 mystery books and 36 picture books, so:
* Total number of books = 12 + 36 = 48 books

{The final answer is 48 books}.<|eot_id|>",48,48.0,48.0

                    question:
                     Paul had saved : up? 3 dollars. If he received another 7 dollars for his allowance, how many 5 dollar toys could he buy?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Find the total amount of money Paul has saved up.
Paul had saved up $3 initially.

Step 2: Add the allowance to the total amount of money Paul has saved up.
He received an additional $7 for his allowance, so the new total amount of money is:
$3 (initial savings) + $7 (allowance) = $10

Step 3: Divide the new total amount of money by the cost of each 5-dollar toy.
To find out how many toys Paul can buy, we need to divide the total amount of money by the cost of each toy.
$10 (total amount) ÷ $5 (cost of each toy) = 2

Step 4: Round down to the nearest whole number (since you can't buy a fraction of a toy).
The result is 2, so Paul can buy 2 toys with the money he has.

{The final answer is} Paul can buy 2 5-dollar toys.<|eot_id|>",2,2.0,5.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of team members.
The trivia team had 14 members initially.

Step 2: Identify the number of members who didn't show up.
7 members didn't show up.

Step 3: Calculate the number of members who did show up.
To find the number of members who did show up, subtract the number of members who didn't show up from the initial number of team members:
14 (initial members) - 7 (members who didn't show up) = 7

Step 4: Identify the number of points scored by each member who showed up.
Each member who showed up scored 5 points.

Step 5: Calculate the total points scored by the members who showed up.
Since 7 members showed up, and each member scored 5 points, the total points scored by the members who showed up is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of books Oliver is left with after the librarian takes 10.

Original number of books = 46
Librarian takes 10 books, so Oliver is left with:
46 - 10 = 36 books

Step 2: Calculate the number of books Oliver can fit on each shelf.

Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf.

Step 3: Divide the number of books Oliver has left by the number of books he can fit on each shelf to find the number of shelves needed.

Number of books Oliver has left = 36
Number of books he can fit on each shelf = 4

36 ÷ 4 = 9

Step 4: Since Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf, he will need 9 shelves to put away all the remaining books.

                    question:
                     Luke? was putting his spare change into piles. He had 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes. If each pile had 3 coins in it, how many coins did he have total?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Luke has 5 piles of quarters.
* Each pile has 3 quarters.
* Luke has 5 piles of dimes.
* Each pile has 3 dimes.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of quarters.

* Since each pile has 3 quarters, we multiply the number of piles by 3 to get the total number of quarters: 5 piles × 3 quarters/pile = 15 quarters

Step 3: Calculate the total number of dimes.

* Since each pile has 3 dimes, we multiply the number of piles by 3 to get the total number of dimes: 5 piles × 3 dimes/pile = 15 dimes

Step 4: Add the total number of quarters and dimes to get the total number of coins.

* 15 quarters + 15 dimes = 30 coins

Step 5: Check the answer to ensure it makes sense.

* The problem states that each pile has 3 coins, and there are 5 piles of each type. This means that the total number of coins should be a multiple of 5 (since there are 5 piles). The answer, 30, is not a multiple of 5, so we need to re-examine the problem.

Step 6: Re-examine the problem to identify any errors.

* Upon re-reading the problem, we notice that it doesn't specify the denomination of the coins in each pile. We assumed that each pile had 3 quarters or 3 dimes, but the problem doesn't explicitly state this.

Step 7: Provide an answer that is consistent with the information given in the problem.

* Since the problem doesn't specify the denomination of the coins, we can't provide a definitive answer. However, we can say that Luke has a total of 30 coins, but we don't know the exact composition of those coins (e.g., 15 quarters and 15 dimes, or 30 coins of a different denomination).

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Identify the information given in the problem.

* Gwen recycled 5 pounds of paper.
* Her friends recycled 13 pounds of paper.
* For every 3 pounds recycled, they earn 1 point.

**Step 2:** Calculate the total pounds of paper recycled by Gwen and her friends.

* Gwen recycled 5 pounds.
* Her friends recycled 13 pounds.
* Total pounds recycled = 5 + 13 = 18 pounds.

**Step 3:** Divide the total pounds recycled by 3 to find the number of groups of 3 pounds.

* 18 pounds ÷ 3 = 6 groups of 3 pounds.

**Step 4:** Since each group of 3 pounds earns 1 point, calculate the total number of points earned.

* 6 groups of 3 pounds earn 6 points.

**Step 5:** Check the calculation to ensure it makes sense.

* If Gwen recycled 5 pounds and her friends recycled 13 pounds, it's likely that they earned more points than if they had only recycled 5 pounds. The calculation of 6 points seems reasonable.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Rachel took a total of 6 pictures at the zoo and 9 pictures at the museum.

To find the total number of pictures she took, we add the number of pictures she took at the zoo and the museum:

6 (zoo) + 9 (museum) = 15

So, Rachel took a total of 15 pictures.

Step 2: Rachel later deleted 11 pictures.

To find the number of pictures she still has, we subtract the number of pictures she deleted from the total number of pictures she took:

15 (total pictures) - 11 (pictures deleted) = 4

So, Rachel still has 4 pictures.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of cookies Maria has.
Maria has 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies, so we add these numbers together to get the total number of cookies:

5 (chocolate chip) + 19 (oatmeal) = 24 cookies

Step 2: Determine how many cookies are needed to fill one baggie.
Each baggie contains 8 cookies, so we need to know how many groups of 8 cookies we can make from the total number of cookies:

24 cookies ÷ 8 cookies per baggie =?

Step 3: Divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per baggie.
To find the number of baggies Maria can make, we divide the total number of cookies (24) by the number of cookies per baggie (8):

24 ÷ 8 = 3

Step 4: Check if there are any remaining cookies.
Since we're dividing the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per baggie, we can check if there are any remaining cookies:

24 (total cookies) - (3 x 8 cookies per baggie) =?

24 - (3 x 8) = 24 - 24 = 0

There are no remaining cookies, which means Maria can make exactly 3 baggies.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Bianca has 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books. Each shelf has exactly 8 books on it.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of books on the mystery book shelves.
Since each shelf has 8 books, and there are 5 shelves, we can multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf:
5 shelves x 8 books/shelf = 40 books

Step 3: Calculate the total number of books on the picture book shelves.
Similarly, since each shelf has 8 books, and there are 4 shelves, we can multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf:
4 shelves x 8 books/shelf = 32 books

Step 4: Add the total number of books on the mystery book shelves and the picture book shelves.
To find the total number of books, we add the number of books on the mystery book shelves to the number of books on the picture book shelves:

Step 1: Identify the number of new cards John has to add to the binder. He has 8 new cards.

Step 2: Identify the number of old cards John has to add to the binder. He has 16 old cards.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cards John has to add to the binder. This is done by adding the number of new cards and old cards: 8 (new) + 16 (old) = 24 cards.

Step 4: Since John can fit 3 cards on each page, we need to calculate how many groups of 3 cards we can make with the total number of cards (24). To do this, we divide the total number of cards by 3: 24 ÷ 3 = 8.

Step 5: Since John can fit 3 cards on each page, and we've calculated that we can make 8 groups of 3 cards, we know that John will need 8 pages to store all his cards.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Isabel baked 3 brownies, and she needs a total of 5 brownies. We also know that she used 5 cups of flour for each brownie.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of flour used for the 3 brownies.
Since she used 5 cups of flour for each brownie, and she made 3 brownies, the total amount of flour used is:
5 cups/brownie × 3 brownies = 15 cups

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of flour needed for the 5 brownies.
Since she needs a total of 5 brownies, and each brownie requires 5 cups of flour, the total amount of flour needed is:
5 brownies × 5 cups/brownie = 25 cups

Step 4: Find the difference between the total amount of flour needed and the total amount of flour used.
To find out how much flour she still needs, we subtract the total amount of flour used from the total amount of flour needed:

Step 2: She sold 5 cupcakes. To find out how many cupcakes she has left, we subtract 5 from 19:

19 - 5 = 14

So, Maria has 14 cupcakes left.

Step 3: Maria then made 10 more cupcakes. To find the total number of cupcakes she now has, we add the 14 cupcakes she had left to the 10 new cupcakes she made:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many tickets Tom has left after spending 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth.

Tom bought 40 tickets initially, and spent 28 tickets. To find out how many tickets he has left, we subtract 28 from 40:

40 - 28 = 12

Tom has 12 tickets left.

Step 2: Determine how many rides he can go on with the remaining 12 tickets.

Each ride costs 4 tickets, so to find out how many rides Tom can go on, we divide the number of tickets he has left (12) by the number of tickets per ride (4):

12 ÷ 4 = 3

Tom can go on 3 rides with the remaining 12 tickets.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the problem statement
The problem statement is: ""Bianca and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Bianca recycled 24 pounds and her friends recycled 3 pounds, how many points did they earn?""

Step 2: Understand the problem
The problem is asking us to calculate the total number of points earned by Bianca and her friends. We know that for every 3 pounds recycled, they earn 1 point.

Step 3: Calculate the points earned by Bianca
Bianca recycled 24 pounds. To find the number of points she earned, we need to divide 24 pounds by 3 pounds (since they earn 1 point for every 3 pounds recycled). This gives us:

24 pounds ÷ 3 pounds = 8 points

So, Bianca earned 8 points.

Step 4: Calculate the points earned by her friends
Her friends recycled 3 pounds. To find the number of points they earned, we need to divide 3 pounds by 3 pounds (since they earn 1 point for every 3 pounds recycled). This gives us:

3 pounds ÷ 3 pounds = 1 point

So, her friends earned 1 point.

Step 5: Add the points earned by Bianca and her friends

Step 2: He throws away 19 old socks that didn't fit. To find the number of socks he has left after throwing them away, we subtract 19 from 33:

33 - 19 = 14

So, John has 14 socks left after throwing away the old ones.

Step 3: John buys 13 new socks. To find the total number of socks he has now, we add the 14 socks he had left to the 13 new socks:

There are 2 new players and 6 returning players, so the total number of players is:
2 (new players) + 6 (returning players) = 8 players

Step 2: Determine the number of groups with 4 players in each group.
To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players (8) by the number of players in each group (4).

8 players ÷ 4 players per group =?

Step 3: Perform the division.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total time needed to paint all 6 rooms.
Each room takes 5 hours to paint, so the total time needed to paint all 6 rooms is:
6 rooms × 5 hours/room = 30 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time already spent painting 2 rooms.
Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the time spent painting 2 rooms is:
2 rooms × 5 hours/room = 10 hours

Step 3: Calculate the remaining time needed to paint the remaining 4 rooms.
Since the painter has already spent 10 hours painting 2 rooms, the remaining time needed to paint the remaining 4 rooms is:
30 hours (total time needed) - 10 hours (time already spent) = 20 hours

Step 4: Calculate the time needed to paint the remaining 4 rooms.
Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the time needed to paint the remaining 4 rooms is:
4 rooms × 5 hours/room = 20 hours

Step 5: Compare the remaining time needed to paint the remaining 4 rooms with the time already spent painting 2 rooms.
Since the remaining time needed to paint the remaining 4 rooms is 20 hours, and the painter has already spent 10 hours painting 2 rooms, the painter still needs to spend:

                    question:
                     A waiter had 22 customers in his section., If, 14 of them left and the rest of his tables had 4 people at! each table, how many tables did he have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The waiter had 22 customers initially. If 14 of them left, how many customers are left?

22 (initial customers) - 14 (customers who left) = 8

So, there are 8 customers left.

Step 2: The problem states that the rest of the tables had 4 people at each table. Since there are 8 customers left, we can assume that these 8 customers are seated at tables with 4 people at each table.

Step 3: To find the number of tables, we can divide the number of customers left (8) by the number of people at each table (4).

8 (customers left) ÷ 4 (people at each table) = 2

So, there are 2 tables with 4 people at each table.

Step 4: Since each table has 4 people, we can multiply the number of tables (2) by the number of people at each table (4) to find the total number of people at these tables.

2 (tables) × 4 (people at each table) = 8

This matches the number of customers left (8), which confirms our assumption.

Step 5: Since there are 2 tables with 4 people at each table, we can conclude that the waiter had 2 tables.

{The final answer is 2 tables}.<|eot_id|>",2,2.0,2.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Roger started with 120 pieces of clothing to wash.

Step 2: He put 48 pieces in one load. To find out how many pieces are left, we subtract 48 from 120:

120 - 48 = 72

So, there are 72 pieces of clothing left.

Step 3: Roger decided to split the remaining 72 pieces into 9 equal loads. To find out how many pieces can go in each load, we divide 72 by 9:

72 ÷ 9 = 8

So, 8 pieces of clothing can go in each of the small loads.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of students in fourth grade.
We are told that there were 10 students in fourth grade at the start of the year.

Step 2: Determine the number of students who left.
We are told that 4 students left during the year.

Step 3: Calculate the number of students who left.
Since there were 10 students initially and 4 left, we subtract 4 from 10 to find the number of students who left:
10 - 4 = 6

Step 4: Determine the number of new students who came.
We are told that 42 new students came to school during the year.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of students at the end of the year.
We have 6 students who left, which means that the number of students remaining is:
10 - 4 = 6

Adding the 42 new students to the remaining 6 students, we get:
6 + 42 = 48

Step 6: Write the final answer.
At the end of the year, there were 48 students in fourth grade.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Roger starts with 14 books.

Step 2: A librarian takes 2 books away, leaving Roger with the rest. To find out how many books Roger has left, we subtract 2 from 14:

14 - 2 = 12

So, Roger has 12 books left.

Step 3: Roger can fit 3 books on a shelf. To find out how many shelves he'll need, we divide the number of books he has left (12) by the number of books he can fit on a shelf (3):

12 ÷ 3 = 4

Step 4: Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round up 4 to 4.

Bianca picked 39 tulips and 49 roses, so we need to find the total number of flowers.

Total flowers = Tulips + Roses
= 39 + 49
= 88

Step 2: Identify the number of flowers Bianca used.
Bianca used 81 flowers, which is the number of flowers she actually used in her bouquets.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total flowers and the used flowers.
To find the number of extra flowers Bianca picked, we need to subtract the number of used flowers from the total flowers.

Emily bought 4 new chairs and 2 new tables. To find the total number of pieces, we add the two quantities:

4 chairs + 2 tables = 6 pieces of furniture

Step 2: Identify the time spent assembling each piece.

Emily spent 8 minutes on each piece of furniture putting it together.

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent assembling all the pieces.

Since Emily assembled 6 pieces of furniture, and she spent 8 minutes on each piece, we multiply the number of pieces by the time spent on each piece:

We also know that he had washed 20 of them by the time school started.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of shirts Dave had to wash.
To find the total number of shirts, we add the number of short-sleeve shirts to the number of long-sleeve shirts:
9 (short-sleeve shirts) + 27 (long-sleeve shirts) = 36 shirts

Step 3: Determine how many shirts Dave had washed.
We know that Dave had washed 20 shirts by the time school started.

Step 4: Calculate how many shirts Dave did not wash.
To find the number of shirts Dave did not wash, we subtract the number of shirts he had washed from the total number of shirts:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of students on the debate team.

We are given that there are 26 boys and 46 girls on the team. To find the total number of students, we add the number of boys and girls:

26 (boys) + 46 (girls) = 72 students

Step 2: Determine the number of groups of 9 that can be formed.

To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of students (72) by the number of students in each group (9):

72 ÷ 9 = 8

Step 3: Check if there are any remaining students.

Since we divided the total number of students by the number of students in each group, we can check if there are any remaining students by looking at the remainder of the division:

72 ÷ 9 = 8 with a remainder of 0

This means that there are no remaining students, and the 72 students can be divided evenly into groups of 9.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial order
The cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples.

Step 2: Determine the total number of apples ordered
The total number of apples ordered is 6 (red) + 15 (green) = 21 apples.

Step 3: Identify the number of students who want fruit
Only 5 students want fruit.

Step 4: Determine the number of apples needed for the students
Since each student wants fruit, and there are 5 students, the cafeteria needs 5 apples (assuming each student gets one apple).

Step 5: Calculate the difference between the total apples ordered and the apples needed for the students
The cafeteria ordered 21 apples, but only needs 5 apples for the students. To find the difference, subtract the number of apples needed from the total number of apples ordered:

21 (total apples) - 5 (apples needed for students) = 16 apples

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of cookies Robin has.

Robin has 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies. To find the total number of cookies, we add these two numbers together:

23 (chocolate chip cookies) + 25 (oatmeal cookies) = 48 cookies

Step 2: Determine how many cookies are needed to fill one baggie.

Each baggie contains 6 cookies.

Step 3: Divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies needed to fill one baggie.

To find out how many baggies Robin can make, we divide the total number of cookies (48) by the number of cookies in one baggie (6):

48 cookies ÷ 6 cookies/bag = 8 baggies

Step 4: Check if there are any leftover cookies.

Since we divided the total number of cookies by the number of cookies needed to fill one baggie, we can check if there are any leftover cookies. In this case, we can see that:

48 cookies ÷ 6 cookies/bag = 8 baggies with 0 cookies left over

{The final answer is} Robin can make 8 baggies of cookies.<|eot_id|>",8,8.0,8.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial amount of candy Katie and her sister have combined.

Katie has 8 pieces of candy.
Her sister has 23 pieces of candy.

To combine their candy, we add the two amounts together:

8 (Katie's candy) + 23 (sister's candy) = 31

So, Katie and her sister have a total of 31 pieces of candy initially.

Step 2: Determine how many pieces they ate the first night.

They ate 8 pieces the first night.

Step 3: Subtract the number of pieces eaten from the initial total.

To find the number of pieces left, we subtract the number eaten (8) from the initial total (31):

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the problem
Jerry needs to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another table.

Step 2: Determine Jerry's capacity
Jerry can only carry 8 trays at a time.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of trays Jerry needs to pick up
9 trays from one table + 7 trays from another table = 16 trays

Step 4: Determine how many trips Jerry needs to make to pick up all the trays
Jerry can only carry 8 trays at a time, so he needs to make trips to pick up the trays. Let's calculate how many trips:

16 trays (total) ÷ 8 trays (Jerry's capacity) = 2 trips (with 8 trays left over) + 1 trip (with 8 trays)

Step 5: Add the number of trips
Jerry needs to make 2 trips (with 8 trays left over) + 1 trip (with 8 trays) = 3 trips

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Faye scores 7 points for each treasure she finds.
We also know that she found 2 treasures on the first level and 6 treasures on the second level.

Step 2: Calculate the total points Faye scored on the first level.
She found 2 treasures on the first level, and each treasure is worth 7 points. So, her score on the first level is:
2 treasures x 7 points/treasure = 14 points

Step 3: Calculate the total points Faye scored on the second level.
She found 6 treasures on the second level, and each treasure is worth 7 points. So, her score on the second level is:
6 treasures x 7 points/treasure = 42 points

Step 4: Add the points Faye scored on both levels to find her total score.
Her score on the first level was 14 points, and her score on the second level was 42 points. So, her total score is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* A worksheet has 4 problems on it.
* The teacher has 16 worksheets to grade.
* The teacher has already graded 8 worksheets.

Step 2: Determine how many problems the teacher has already graded.

* Since the teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, and each worksheet has 4 problems, the teacher has already graded:
8 worksheets x 4 problems per worksheet = 32 problems

Step 3: Determine how many problems the teacher still needs to grade.

* The teacher has 16 worksheets in total, and has already graded 8. To find out how many worksheets she still needs to grade, subtract the number of worksheets she's already graded from the total:
16 worksheets - 8 worksheets = 8 worksheets
* Since each worksheet has 4 problems, the teacher still needs to grade:
8 worksheets x 4 problems per worksheet = 32 problems

Step 4: Subtract the number of problems the teacher has already graded from the total number of problems she still needs to grade.

* The teacher has already graded 32 problems, and she still needs to grade 32 problems. To find out how many more problems she needs to grade, subtract the number of problems she's already graded from the total:
32 problems - 32 problems = 0 problems

However, this doesn't make sense, as the teacher can't have already graded 32 problems and still have 32 problems to grade. This must be a mistake.

Let's re-examine the problem. The teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, which means she's already graded 8 x 4 = 32 problems. She has 16 - 8 = 8 worksheets left to grade, and each of those worksheets has 4 problems. To find out how many more problems she needs to grade, multiply the number of worksheets left to grade by the number of problems per worksheet:
8 worksheets x 4 problems per worksheet = 32 problems

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of boxes Paige has.
Paige has 6 boxes of clothing.

Step 2: Identify the number of scarves and mittens in each box.
Each box contains 5 scarves and 5 mittens, so in total, each box contains 5 + 5 = 10 pieces of winter clothing.

Step 3: Multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces of winter clothing in each box.
Since there are 6 boxes, and each box contains 10 pieces of winter clothing, we multiply 6 by 10 to get:
6 x 10 = 60

Step 4: The final answer is the total number of pieces of winter clothing Paige has.

* He has already cooked 6 potatoes.
* Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

Step 2: Calculate the number of potatoes left to cook

* The chef needs to cook 12 potatoes, but he has already cooked 6. To find the number of potatoes left to cook, we subtract 6 from 12:
12 - 6 = 6

So, there are 6 potatoes left to cook.

Step 3: Calculate the total cooking time for the remaining potatoes

* Since each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, and there are 6 potatoes left to cook, we multiply the number of potatoes by the cooking time per potato:
6 potatoes x 6 minutes/potato = 36 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Ned bought 50 games from a friend. This is a fixed amount.

Step 2: He bought 27 more games at a garage sale. This is an additional amount.

Step 3: To find the total number of games Ned bought, we add the two amounts together: 50 + 27 = 77 games.

Step 4: The problem states that 74 games didn't work. This means that Ned has 77 - 74 = 3 games that didn't work.

Step 5: To find the number of good games Ned has, we subtract the number of non-working games from the total number of games: 77 - 3 = 74 games.

Step 6: However, this answer is not correct because we initially added the 50 games from the friend and the 27 games from the garage sale. We need to subtract the 50 games from the friend first, and then subtract the 27 games from the garage sale. So, the correct calculation is: 50 - 74 = 74 games (from the friend), and then 74 - 27 = 47 games (from the garage sale).

Step 7: Adding the two amounts together, Ned has a total of 74 + 47 = 121 games.

Step 8: However, 74 of these games didn't work. To find the number of good games, we subtract the number of non-working games from the total number of games: 121 - 74 = 47 games.

The cafeteria had 50 apples initially.

Step 2: Identify the number of apples given out to students.
The cafeteria handed out 5 apples to students.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining apples after giving out the 5 apples to students.
The cafeteria started with 50 apples and gave out 5, so the remaining apples are:
50 - 5 = 45 apples

Step 4: Identify the number of apples needed to make a pie.
Each pie takes 5 apples.

Step 5: Calculate the number of pies that can be made using the remaining apples.
Since each pie takes 5 apples and there are 45 apples remaining, we can divide the remaining apples by 5 to find the number of pies that can be made:
45 ÷ 5 = 9 pies

Step 6: Check if there are any apples left over after making the pies.
Since 45 apples are used to make 9 pies, we can subtract the number of apples used (9 x 5 = 45) from the original number of apples to find the remaining apples:

                     Zoe was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 8 boxes of clothing and inside each box. there were ; 4 scarves and 6 mittens.! How many pieces of winter clothing did Zoe have total?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of boxes Zoe has: Zoe has 8 boxes of clothing.

Step 2: Identify the number of scarves in each box: Each box has 4 scarves.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of scarves: Since there are 8 boxes, and each box has 4 scarves, the total number of scarves is:

8 boxes x 4 scarves per box = 8 x 4 = 32 scarves

Step 4: Identify the number of mittens in each box: Each box has 6 mittens.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of mittens: Since there are 8 boxes, and each box has 6 mittens, the total number of mittens is:

8 boxes x 6 mittens per box = 8 x 6 = 48 mittens

Step 6: Add the total number of scarves and mittens: To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we add the number of scarves and mittens:

32 scarves + 48 mittens = 80 pieces of winter clothing

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem

* Frank bought 3 decks
* His friend bought 2 decks
* The cost of each deck is $7

Step 2: Calculate the total number of decks bought

* Frank bought 3 decks, so the total number of decks bought by Frank is 3
* His friend bought 2 decks, so the total number of decks bought by his friend is 2
* The total number of decks bought is the sum of the number of decks bought by Frank and his friend: 3 + 2 = 5

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the decks

* Since 5 decks were bought, and each deck costs $7, the total cost is 5 x $7 = $35

                    question:
                     Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts. before school.. If ; he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not : wash?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of shirts Sam had to wash.
Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts. To find the total number, I add these two numbers together:

40 (short sleeve) + 23 (long sleeve) = 63 shirts

Step 2: Determine how many shirts Sam washed before school started.
Sam washed 29 shirts before school started.

Step 3: Find the number of shirts Sam did not wash.
To find the number of shirts Sam did not wash, I subtract the number of shirts he washed (29) from the total number of shirts he had to wash (63):

63 (total shirts) - 29 (shirts washed) = 34 shirts

So, Sam did not wash 34 shirts.

{The final answer is 34 shirts}.<|eot_id|>",34,34.0,34.0
" A waiter had 47 : customers to wait on. If 41 customers left and he got another 20 customers, how many customers would he have? ","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     A waiter had 47 : customers to wait on. If 41 customers left and he got another 20 customers, how many customers would he have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The waiter initially has 47 customers to wait on.

Step 2: 41 customers leave. To find out how many customers are left, we subtract 41 from 47:

47 - 41 = 6

So, after 41 customers leave, the waiter is left with 6 customers.

Step 3: The waiter gets 20 new customers. To find out how many customers he has now, we add the 20 new customers to the 6 remaining customers:

6 + 20 = 26

Step 4: Therefore, the waiter now has 26 customers.

{The final answer is 26.}<|eot_id|>",26,26.0,26.0
