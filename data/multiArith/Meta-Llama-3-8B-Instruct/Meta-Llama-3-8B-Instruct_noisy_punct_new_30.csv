                    question:
                     Paige ; had 11 songs on? her mp3 player.. If she deleted 9, old, songs? from it and then, added 8 new songs, how many songs does she, have on! her mp3! player?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Paige initially has 11 songs on her mp3 player.

Step 2: She deletes 9 old songs from the mp3 player. To find out how many songs are left, we subtract 9 from 11:

11 - 9 = 2

So, after deleting 9 songs, Paige has 2 songs left on her mp3 player.

Step 3: She then adds 8 new songs to the mp3 player. To find out how many songs she has now, we add 8 to the 2 songs she had left:

2 + 8 = 10

Therefore, after deleting 9 old songs and adding 8 new songs, Paige has {The final answer is} 10 songs on her mp3 player.<|eot_id|>",10

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the school's basketball team.

Step 2: Combine the number of girls and boys
To find the total number of students trying out, add the number of girls and boys:
39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students

Step 3: Identify the number of students who got called back
Only 26 students got called back.

Step 4: Find the number of students who didn't make the cut
To find the number of students who didn't make the cut, subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students trying out:
43 students (trying out) - 26 students (who got called back) = 17 students

{The final answer is 17 students didn't make the cut.}<|eot_id|>",17

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Faye had 34 coloring books initially.

Step 2: She gave away 3 of them. To find the number of books she has left, we subtract 3 from 34:

34 - 3 = 31

So, Faye has 31 coloring books left.

Step 3: But then, she bought 48 more coloring books. To find the total number of books she now has, we add the 48 new books to the 31 she had left:

31 + 48 = 79

Step 4: Finally, we need to find the total number of coloring books Faye has now. The answer is:

{The final answer is} 79<|eot_id|>",79

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The cafeteria starts with 23 apples.

Step 2: They use 20 apples to make lunch for the students. To find out how many apples they have left, we subtract 20 from 23:

23 - 20 = 3

So, the cafeteria has 3 apples left.

Step 3: They then buy 6 more apples. To find out how many apples they have in total, we add 6 to the 3 they had left:

3 + 6 = 9

Therefore, the cafeteria now has 9 apples.

{The final answer is 9 apples.}<|eot_id|>",9

The problem states that Megan earned 8 points for each bag of cans recycled.

Step 2: Determine the total number of bags Megan recycled.
The problem states that Megan had 14 bags, but didn't recycle 5 of them. To find the total number of bags recycled, we subtract the number of bags not recycled from the total number of bags:
14 (total bags) - 5 (bags not recycled) = 9 bags recycled

Step 3: Calculate the total points earned for the recycled bags.
Since Megan earned 8 points for each bag recycled, we multiply the number of bags recycled by the points earned per bag:
9 bags recycled Ã— 8 points per bag = 72 points

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that April's Discount Flowers is having a sale, and each rose is $4. April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left. We need to find out how much money April earned.

Step 2: Identify the unknown variable
The unknown variable is the amount of money April earned. Let's call it x.

Step 3: Use the information given
The problem states that April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left. This means that April sold 13 - 4 = 9 roses.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount earned
Since each rose is $4, the total amount earned from selling 9 roses is:
9 roses x $4 per rose = $36

Step 5: Determine the amount of money April earned
Since April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left, she sold 9 roses. The total amount earned from selling 9 roses is $36. Therefore, the amount of money April earned is $36.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of shirts Ned had to wash.

Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts, which makes a total of:

9 (short sleeve) + 21 (long sleeve) = 30 shirts

Step 2: Identify the number of shirts Ned washed before school started.

Ned washed 29 shirts before school started.

Step 3: Calculate the number of shirts Ned did not wash.

To find the number of shirts Ned did not wash, we need to subtract the number of shirts he washed (29) from the total number of shirts he had to wash (30).

30 (total shirts) - 29 (shirts washed) = 1 shirt

Step 4: Write the final answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of people invited
The company invited 47 people.

Step 2: Identify the number of people who didn't show up
7 people didn't show up.

Step 3: Calculate the number of people who actually showed up
47 (total invited) - 7 (didn't show up) = 40 people who actually showed up

Step 4: Determine the number of tables needed
Each table can hold 5 people. To find out how many tables are needed, we need to divide the number of people who showed up by 5.

40 (people who showed up) Ã· 5 (people per table) = 8 tables

Step 5: Check if the result makes sense
The company invited 47 people, and 7 didn't show up, so it's reasonable to assume that the remaining 40 people would fit into 8 tables of 5 people each.

{The final answer is 8 tables.}<|eot_id|>",8
"!  Tom had 5 books. ; If he ; sold . 4 : of them : and used the money he earned to buy 38 new , books, how many books would Tom have? ! ","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Tom had 5 books initially.

Step 2: He sold 4 of them. To find out how many books he sold, we subtract 4 from 5:

5 - 4 = 1

So, Tom sold 1 book (not 4, which is a typo in the problem statement).

Step 3: He used the money he earned to buy 38 new books. This means that Tom added 38 new books to his collection.

Step 4: To find the total number of books Tom has now, we add the number of books he had initially (5) to the number of new books he bought (38):

5 + 38 = 43

Therefore, Tom would have 43 books.

{The final answer is 43}.<|eot_id|>",39

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sodas Jerry bought.
Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. To find the total number of sodas, we add these two numbers together:

41 (regular sodas) + 22 (diet sodas) = 63 sodas

Step 2: Determine how many sodas can fit on each shelf.
Jerry's fridge can hold 9 sodas on each shelf.

Step 3: Calculate how many shelves Jerry would need to store all his sodas.
To find out how many shelves Jerry would need, we divide the total number of sodas (63) by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf (9).

63 sodas Ã· 9 sodas per shelf = 7 shelves

Step 4: Check if Jerry would need to fill up any extra shelves.
Since Jerry would need 7 shelves to store all his sodas, and his fridge can hold 9 sodas on each shelf, he would actually fill up 7 shelves completely.

{The final answer is 7 shelves.}<|eot_id|>",7

* They ate 35 pieces of candy on the first night.

Step 2: Determine the total number of pieces of candy they had initially.

* Debby has 32 pieces of candy.
* Her sister has 42 pieces of candy.
* To find the total number of pieces of candy, add the two amounts together: 32 + 42 = 74

Step 3: Subtract the number of pieces they ate on the first night from the total number of pieces.

* They ate 35 pieces of candy on the first night.
* Subtract 35 from the total number of pieces: 74 - 35 = 39

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Emily started with 41 seeds.

Step 2: She planted 29 seeds in the big garden.

Step 3: To find out how many seeds Emily has left, we subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds:

41 (initial seeds) - 29 (seeds planted in big garden) = 12 seeds left

Step 4: Emily planted 4 seeds in each of her small gardens. To find out how many small gardens she has, we can divide the number of seeds left (12) by the number of seeds planted in each small garden (4):

12 Ã· 4 = 3

Step 5: Since Emily planted 4 seeds in each of her small gardens, she must have 3 small gardens (since 4 Ã— 3 = 12).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of candy pieces Emily received.
Emily received 5 pieces from her neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister, so the total number of pieces is:
5 + 13 = 18

Step 2: Identify the number of pieces Emily eats per day.
Emily eats 9 pieces of candy per day.

Step 3: Calculate the number of days the candy will last.
To find out how long the candy will last, we need to divide the total number of pieces (18) by the number of pieces Emily eats per day (9).

18 Ã· 9 = 2

Step 4: Check the answer.
Since Emily eats 9 pieces per day, she will finish the candy in 2 days.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of books Mike has to put away.
Mike has 82 books initially.

Step 2: A librarian takes 10 books away, leaving Mike with the rest.
Mike is left with 82 - 10 = 72 books.

Step 3: Mike can fit 9 books on a shelf.
This means that each shelf can hold 9 books.

Step 4: Calculate the number of shelves needed to hold the remaining books.
To find the number of shelves needed, divide the number of remaining books (72) by the number of books that can fit on a shelf (9).

72 Ã· 9 = 8

Step 5: Mike needs at least 8 shelves to hold the remaining books.
Since Mike can't fit a fraction of a book on a shelf, he needs a whole number of shelves. Therefore, Mike needs at least 8 shelves to hold the remaining 72 books.

{The final answer is 8 shelves.}<|eot_id|>",8

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of windows left to be installed.
The builder has already installed 8 windows out of a total of 14 needed. To find the number of windows left to be installed, subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed:

14 (total windows) - 8 (windows already installed) = 6

{The number of windows left to be installed is 6.}

Step 2: Determine the time it takes to install one window.
It takes 8 hours to install one window. We need to find the time it takes to install the remaining 6 windows.

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to install the remaining windows.
To find the time it takes to install the remaining 6 windows, multiply the time it takes to install one window (8 hours) by the number of windows left to be installed (6):

8 hours/window Ã— 6 windows = 48 hours

{The time it takes to install the remaining 6 windows is 48 hours.}

The final answer is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The store starts with 40 oranges in the bin.

Step 2: They throw away 25 old oranges. To find the number of oranges left in the bin after throwing away 25, we subtract 25 from 40:

40 - 25 = 15

So, there are 15 oranges left in the bin after throwing away 25 old ones.

Step 3: The store puts 21 new oranges in the bin.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of chicken wings cooked by the chef.
The problem states that the chef had already cooked 9 chicken wings.

Step 2: Determine the total number of chicken wings cooked after the chef cooked 7 more.
The chef cooked 9 initial wings, and then cooked 7 more. To find the total number of wings, we add the two numbers together:

9 (initial wings) + 7 (additional wings) = 16 wings

Step 3: Determine the number of wings each person will get.
There are 4 friends in the group, and they each get the same amount. To find the number of wings each person gets, we divide the total number of wings by 4:

16 wings Ã· 4 people = 4 wings per person

Step 4: Verify the answer.
To ensure that our answer is correct, let's multiply the number of people (4) by the number of wings per person (4):

4 people Ã— 4 wings per person = 16 wings

This matches the total number of wings cooked, which is 16. Therefore, our answer is correct.

Step 2: She put 44 pictures into one album. This means 44 pictures are accounted for.

Step 3: The problem asks how many pictures were in each album, but we need to find the number of pictures left after putting 44 in one album. To do this, we subtract 44 from the total number of pictures:

79 (total pictures) - 44 (pictures in one album) = 35

Step 4: We know Wendy put the rest of the pictures (35) into 5 different albums. To find the number of pictures in each album, we divide the remaining pictures (35) by the number of albums (5):

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of team members.
The trivia team had 11 members initially.

Step 2: Determine how many members didn't show up.
During the game, 6 members didn't show up.

Step 3: Calculate the number of members who did show up.
To find the number of members who did show up, subtract the number of members who didn't show up from the initial number of members:
11 (initial members) - 6 (didn't show up) = 5

Step 4: Determine the score per member.
Each member who did show up scored 9 points.

Step 5: Calculate the total score.
Since 5 members showed up, multiply the number of members by the score per member:
5 (members) Ã— 9 (points per member) = 45

Step 6: Write the final answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of cats.
The pet store had 13 Siamese cats and 5 house cats. To find the total number of cats, we add these two numbers together:

13 (Siamese cats) + 5 (house cats) = 18 cats

So, the pet store initially had 18 cats.

Step 2: Determine how many cats were sold.
The pet store sold 10 cats during the sale.

Step 3: Subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of cats.
To find the number of cats left, we subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of cats:

18 (initial cats) - 10 (cats sold) = 8

Step 4: Check the answer.
We can verify that the answer makes sense. If the pet store had 18 cats initially and sold 10, it's reasonable to expect that they would have 8 cats left.

{The final answer is 8 cats.}<|eot_id|>",8

Victor makes $6 per hour.

Step 2: Determine the number of hours worked on Monday
Victor worked 5 hours on Monday.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money made on Monday
Since Victor makes $6 per hour, he made:

5 hours x $6 per hour = $30

Step 4: Determine the number of hours worked on Tuesday
Victor worked 5 hours on Tuesday.

Step 5: Calculate the amount of money made on Tuesday
Since Victor makes $6 per hour, he made:

5 hours x $6 per hour = $30

Step 6: Add the amount of money made on Monday and Tuesday

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of cupcakes remaining after Todd ate 43.

Megan started with 71 cupcakes and Todd ate 43. To find the number of cupcakes remaining, we subtract 43 from 71:

71 - 43 = 28

So, Megan has 28 cupcakes remaining.

Step 2: Determine the number of packages Megan can make with 28 cupcakes.

Each package can hold 7 cupcakes. To find the number of packages Megan can make, we divide the number of remaining cupcakes (28) by 7:

28 Ã· 7 = 4

So, Megan can make 4 packages with the remaining 28 cupcakes.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of players.
There were 2 friends playing the video game initially.

Step 2: Identify the number of new players who joined the game.
2 more players joined the game, so the total number of players is:
2 (initial players) + 2 (new players) = 4 players

Step 3: Identify the number of lives each player has.
Each player has 6 lives.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of lives.
Since there are 4 players, and each player has 6 lives, we multiply the number of players by the number of lives each player has:
4 players Ã— 6 lives/player = 24 lives

Step 5: Write the final answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Sam initially had 10 socks.

Step 2: He threw away 3 old socks that didn't fit. To find the number of socks he had left, we subtract 3 from 10:

10 - 3 = 7

So, Sam has 7 socks left.

Step 3: He bought 36 new socks. To find the total number of socks he now has, we add the 36 new socks to the 7 socks he had left:

7 + 36 = 43

Step 4: Therefore, Sam now has a total of 43 socks.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of flowers Wendy has initially.
Wendy picked 103 flowers.

Step 2: Identify the number of flowers that wilted.
47 flowers wilted.

Step 3: Subtract the wilted flowers from the total number of flowers to find the remaining flowers.
103 (initial flowers) - 47 (wilted flowers) = 56 flowers remaining

Step 4: Determine the number of flowers needed for each bouquet.
Each bouquet requires 8 flowers.

Step 5: Divide the remaining flowers by the number of flowers needed for each bouquet to find the maximum number of bouquets that can be made.
56 (remaining flowers) Ã· 8 (flowers per bouquet) = 7 bouquets

Step 6: Check if there are any remaining flowers after making the bouquets.
56 (remaining flowers) - (8 flowers per bouquet Ã— 7 bouquets) = 56 - 56 = 0

Since there are no remaining flowers, Wendy can make exactly 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of books Adam has.
Adam has 48 books.

Step 2: Determine how many books Adam sold.
Adam sold 19/ of his books. To find the actual number of books sold, we need to find 19% of 48.

Step 3: Calculate 19% of 48.
To find 19% of 48, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 19/100 = 0.19. Then, multiply 0.19 by 48:

0.19 Ã— 48 = 9.12

So, Adam sold approximately 9.12 books. Since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we'll round this number to the nearest whole number, which is 9 books.

Step 4: Subtract the number of books sold from the initial number of books.
Adam had 48 books initially. After selling 9 books, he has:

48 - 9 = 39 books left

Step 5: Determine how many new books Adam bought.
Adam used the money he earned from selling books to buy 38 new books.

Step 6: Add the number of new books to the number of books Adam has left.
Adam has 39 books left and buys 38 new books. To find the total number of books Adam now has, we add these two numbers:

39 + 38 = 77 books

* Adults: 3
* Total people: 12 + 3 = 15

Step 3: Divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van (5 people).

* 15 people Ã· 5 people per van = 3

Step 4: Since 3 vans can hold 15 people, and there are more people going than the capacity of the vans, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure everyone can fit.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of brownies Tiffany has already made and the total number of brownies she needs.

* Tiffany has already made 8 brownies.
* She needs 17 brownies in total.

Step 2: Calculate the number of cups of flour Tiffany has already used.

* Since she used 8 cups of flour for each brownie, and she made 8 brownies, she has used a total of:
8 brownies Ã— 8 cups/brownie = 64 cups of flour

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of flour Tiffany needs.

* Since she needs 17 brownies in total, and she uses 8 cups of flour for each brownie, she needs a total of:
17 brownies Ã— 8 cups/brownie = 136 cups of flour

Step 4: Subtract the amount of flour Tiffany has already used from the total amount she needs.

* She has used 64 cups of flour so far.
* She needs a total of 136 cups of flour.
* To find out how much flour she still needs, subtract the amount she has used from the total amount:
136 cups - 64 cups = 72 cups

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of carrots picked by Carol and her mom.

Carol picked 29 carrots.
Her mom picked 16 carrots.
Total number of carrots = 29 + 16 = 45

Step 2: Identify the number of good carrots.

It's given that only 38 carrots are good.

Step 3: Find the total number of carrots that are not good (bad carrots).

Since there are 45 carrots in total, and 38 of them are good, the remaining carrots are bad.

Total number of carrots - Number of good carrots = 45 - 38 = 7

Step 4: The final answer is the number of bad carrots.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that a worksheet has 7 problems, and a teacher has 17 worksheets to grade. The teacher has already graded 8 worksheets. We need to find out how many more problems the teacher has to grade.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of problems in the 17 worksheets
Since each worksheet has 7 problems, the total number of problems in the 17 worksheets is:
17 worksheets x 7 problems per worksheet = 119 problems

Step 3: Calculate the number of problems already graded
The teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, and each worksheet has 7 problems. So, the number of problems already graded is:
8 worksheets x 7 problems per worksheet = 56 problems

Step 4: Calculate the number of problems remaining to be graded
To find the number of problems remaining to be graded, we subtract the number of problems already graded from the total number of problems:
119 problems - 56 problems = 63 problems

Step 5: Calculate the number of worksheets remaining to be graded
Since each worksheet has 7 problems, we can divide the number of problems remaining to be graded by 7 to find the number of worksheets remaining:
63 problems Ã· 7 problems per worksheet = 9 worksheets

Step 6: Answer the question
The teacher has 9 worksheets remaining to grade, and each worksheet has 7 problems. Therefore, the teacher has to grade 63 problems.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of players
To find the total number of players, we add the initial 8 players to the 2 new players:
8 (initial players) + 2 (new players) = 10 players

Step 4: Calculate the total number of lives
Each player has 6 lives. To find the total number of lives, we multiply the number of players by the number of lives each player has:
10 (total players) x 6 (lives per player) =?

Step 5: Calculate the total number of lives
To calculate the total number of lives, we multiply the number of players by the number of lives each player has:

Step 2: He spent 25 tickets on a beanie. To find out how many tickets he has left, we subtract the number of tickets he spent from the initial number of tickets he won:

49 (initial tickets) - 25 (tickets spent) = 24

So, Cody has 24 tickets left.

Step 3: Later, he won 6 more tickets. To find out how many tickets he has now, we add the number of tickets he won to the number of tickets he had left:

24 (tickets left) + 6 (new tickets won) = 30

The school's baseball team had 48 new players and 6 returning players. To find the total number of players, we add these two numbers together:

48 (new players) + 6 (returning players) = 54 players

Step 2: Determine the number of groups
The coach wants to put the players into groups with 6 players in each group. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of players (54) by the number of players in each group (6):

54 players Ã· 6 players per group = 9 groups

Step 3: Confirm the answer
We can confirm our answer by multiplying the number of groups (9) by the number of players in each group (6) to get the total number of players again:

To find the number of files still on the flash drive, we need to subtract the number of deleted files from the initial total:
64 (initial files) - 30 (deleted files) = 34 files

Step 4: Verify the result.
We can verify that the result makes sense by considering that Vanessa had 16 music files and 48 video files initially, and deleting 30 files would leave her with a smaller number of files.

{The final answer is 34 files.}<|eot_id|>",34

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of pictures Gwen took initially.
Gwen took 41 pictures at the zoo and 29 pictures at the museum. To find the total number of pictures, we add these two numbers together:

41 + 29 = 70

So, Gwen took a total of 70 pictures initially.

Step 2: Identify the number of pictures Gwen deleted.
Gwen deleted 15 pictures.

Step 3: Subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures to find the number of pictures Gwen still has.
To do this, we subtract 15 from 70:

70 - 15 = 55

So, Gwen still has 55 pictures from her vacation.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of books bought by Victor.
Victor bought 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books. To find the total number of books, we add these two numbers together:

32 (adventure books) + 37 (mystery books) = 69 books

Step 2: Identify the number of mystery books used.
Victor used 16 mystery books. This means that he still has some mystery books left.

Step 3: Find the number of mystery books left.
To find the number of mystery books left, we subtract the number of mystery books used (16) from the total number of mystery books bought (37):

37 (mystery books bought) - 16 (mystery books used) = 21 mystery books left

Step 4: Find the number of new books bought.
Since Victor used some mystery books, he must have bought new books to replace them. To find the number of new books bought, we add the number of mystery books left (21) to the number of adventure books bought (32):

21 (mystery books left) + 32 (adventure books) = 53 new books

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Janet bought 6 country albums and 2 pop albums. We need to find the total number of albums she bought.

6 (country albums) + 2 (pop albums) = 8 albums

Step 2: Each album comes with a lyric sheet and has 9 songs. We need to find the total number of songs in each album.

9 songs per album

Step 3: Since Janet bought 8 albums, we need to multiply the number of songs per album by the total number of albums.

9 songs per album Ã— 8 albums = 72 songs

Step 4: This gives us the total number of songs in the albums Janet bought. However, we need to find the total number of songs she bought, including the songs in each album.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate Jerry's total earnings from mowing lawns and weed eating.

Jerry made 14 dollars from mowing lawns.
Jerry made 31 dollars from weed eating.
Total earnings = 14 + 31 = 45 dollars

Step 2: Calculate Jerry's weekly expenses.

Jerry spends 5 dollars per week.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Jerry has.

Jerry has 45 dollars in total.

Step 4: Calculate how many weeks the money will last.

To do this, we'll divide the total amount of money Jerry has (45 dollars) by his weekly expenses (5 dollars).

45 dollars Ã· 5 dollars/week = 9 weeks

Step 5: Verify the answer.

Since Jerry has 45 dollars and spends 5 dollars per week, it will take him 9 weeks to run out of money.

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                   ,  Adam had 33 books. If he sold 11. of them and used the? money he earned to buy 23 new books,, how? many ; books? would, Adam have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Adam had 33 books initially.

Step 2: He sold 11/33 of his books. To find the number of books sold, multiply the total number of books by the fraction sold:

33 x (11/33) = 11

So, Adam sold 11 books.

Step 3: He used the money earned from selling the books to buy 23 new books. Let's assume the price of each book is the same. To find the total amount of money earned, multiply the number of books sold by the price of each book (which is unknown for now). Let's call the price of each book ""x"". Then, the total amount of money earned is:

11x

Step 4: Adam used this money to buy 23 new books. To find the total amount of money spent, multiply the number of new books by the price of each book (which is still unknown):

23x

Step 5: Since Adam used the money earned from selling books to buy new books, the total amount of money earned must equal the total amount of money spent:

11x = 23x

Step 6: Simplify the equation by subtracting 11x from both sides:

0 = 12x

Step 7: Divide both sides by 12 to find the price of each book:

x = 0

This means the price of each book is $0, which is impossible. The problem statement doesn't provide enough information to determine the price of each book. However, we can still find the total number of books Adam has after buying the new books.

Step 8: Adam initially had 33 books and sold 11. After selling the books, he had:

33 - 11 = 22

books left. He used the money earned to buy 23 new books, so his total number of books is:

22 + 23 = 45

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
Kaleb collected cans on Saturday and Sunday. He filled 5 bags on Saturday and 5 more bags on Sunday.

Step 2: Determine how many cans are in each bag.
Each bag has 4 cans in it.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cans collected on Saturday.
Kaleb filled 5 bags on Saturday, and each bag has 4 cans. To find the total number of cans collected, multiply the number of bags by the number of cans in each bag:
5 bags x 4 cans/bag = 20 cans

Step 4: Calculate the total number of cans collected on Sunday.
Kaleb filled 5 more bags on Sunday, and each bag has 4 cans. To find the total number of cans collected, multiply the number of bags by the number of cans in each bag:
5 bags x 4 cans/bag = 20 cans

Step 5: Add the total number of cans collected on Saturday and Sunday.
To find the total number of cans collected, add the number of cans collected on Saturday and Sunday:
20 cans (Saturday) + 20 cans (Sunday) = 40 cans

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Nancy is organizing her bookcase, and she has:

* 2 shelves of mystery books
* 6 shelves of picture books

Step 2: Determine the number of books on each shelf.
Since Nancy wants each shelf to have exactly 6 books, we can calculate the total number of books on each type of shelf as follows:

* Mystery books: 2 shelves Ã— 6 books/shelf = 12 books
* Picture books: 6 shelves Ã— 6 books/shelf = 36 books

Step 3: Add up the total number of books.
To find the total number of books, we add the number of books on the mystery shelves and the picture shelves:

12 books (mystery) + 36 books (picture) = 48 books

Step 4: Write the final answer.
{The final answer is 48 books}.<|eot_id|>",48

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Determine the total amount of money Paul has saved up.
Paul had saved up 3 dollars initially.

Step 2: Add the allowance to the initial amount.
Paul received another 7 dollars for his allowance. Adding this to the initial amount, we get:
3 (initial amount) + 7 (allowance) = 10 dollars

Step 3: Determine the total amount of money Paul has now.
Paul has a total of 10 dollars.

Step 4: Determine how many 5-dollar toys Paul can buy.
To find out how many 5-dollar toys Paul can buy, we need to divide the total amount of money he has (10 dollars) by the cost of each toy (5 dollars).

10 (total amount) Ã· 5 (cost of each toy) = 2

Step 5: Answer the question.
{The final answer is} Paul can buy 2 5-dollar toys.<|eot_id|>",2

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Wendy initially had 43 lives.

Step 2: She lost 8 lives in the hard part of the game.

To find out how many lives she has left, we need to subtract 8 from 43:

43 - 8 = 35

So, Wendy has 35 lives left.

Step 3: She gets 39 more lives in the next level.

To find out how many lives she has in total, we need to add 39 to 35:

35 + 39 = 74

So, Wendy now has 74 lives.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Katie had 85 files on her computer. She deleted 40 of them.

To find the number of files she has left, we subtract the number of files she deleted from the original number:

85 (original files) - 40 (files deleted) = 45

So, Katie has 45 files left.

Step 2: She put the remaining files into folders with 5 files in each one.

To find the number of folders she needs, we divide the number of files she has left by the number of files per folder:

45 (files left) Ã· 5 (files per folder) = 9

So, Katie needs 9 folders to store the remaining files.

Step 3: How many folders did Katie end up with?

Since we've already calculated the number of folders she needs (9), this is the final answer.

{The final answer is 9 folders.}<|eot_id|>",9

Will worked for 8 hours on Monday. To find the total amount of money he made, we multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly wage:

8 hours x $8/hour = $64

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Will made on Tuesday
Will worked for 2 hours on Tuesday. To find the total amount of money he made, we multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly wage:

2 hours x $8/hour = $16

Step 4: Add the total amount of money made on Monday and Tuesday
To find the total amount of money Will made in those two days, we add the amount he made on Monday and Tuesday:

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends. This means she spent money on 3 tickets.

Step 2: The cost of each ticket is $4.

Step 3: To find out how much Haley spent on the 3 tickets, we multiply the number of tickets (3) by the cost of each ticket ($4).

Step 4: Haley also bought 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. This means she spent more money on these additional tickets.

Step 5: To find out how much Haley spent on the extra 5 tickets, we multiply the number of tickets (5) by the cost of each ticket ($4).

5 tickets x $4 per ticket = $20

Step 6: To find out how much Haley spent in total, we add the amount she spent on the initial 3 tickets ($12) to the amount she spent on the extra 5 tickets ($20).

$12 + $20 = $32

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the number of bird cages the pet store has. The problem states that the pet store has 4 bird cages.

Step 2: Identify the number of parrots and parakeets in each cage. The problem states that each cage has 8 parrots and 2 parakeets.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of birds in each cage. To do this, we need to add the number of parrots and parakeets in each cage.

Number of parrots in each cage = 8
Number of parakeets in each cage = 2
Total number of birds in each cage = 8 + 2 = 10

Step 4: Since there are 4 bird cages, we need to multiply the total number of birds in each cage by 4 to find the total number of birds the pet store has.

Total number of birds in 4 cages = 10 (birds per cage) x 4 (cages) = 40

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Kaleb bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy.
* He gave 5 boxes to his little brother.

Step 2: Determine how many pieces of candy Kaleb gave away.

* Each box has 6 pieces of candy inside.
* Kaleb gave 5 boxes away, so he gave away a total of:
	+ 5 boxes Ã— 6 pieces/box = 30 pieces

Step 3: Subtract the number of pieces Kaleb gave away from the total number of pieces he had initially.

* Kaleb had 14 boxes initially, and each box has 6 pieces. So, he had a total of:
	+ 14 boxes Ã— 6 pieces/box = 84 pieces
* He gave away 30 pieces, so subtracting 30 from 84 gives:
	+ 84 - 30 = 54 pieces

Step 4: Determine how many pieces Kaleb still has.

* Kaleb started with 84 pieces and gave away 30, so he has 54 pieces left.

We know that Bianca has:

* 5 shelves of mystery books
* 4 shelves of picture books
* Each shelf has exactly 8 books on it

Step 2: Calculate the total number of books on the mystery book shelves.
Since each shelf has 8 books and there are 5 shelves, we can multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf:

5 shelves Ã— 8 books/shelf = 40 books

Step 3: Calculate the total number of books on the picture book shelves.
Similarly, we can calculate the total number of books on the picture book shelves:

4 shelves Ã— 8 books/shelf = 32 books

Step 4: Add the total number of books on the mystery book shelves and the picture book shelves to find the total number of books.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Isabel baked 3 brownies, but needs a total of 5 brownies for her party.

* This means she needs to bake 2 more brownies (5 - 3 = 2).

Step 2: Isabel used 5 cups of flour for each brownie. Since she baked 3 brownies, she used a total of:

* 3 brownies x 5 cups/brownie = 15 cups of flour

Step 3: Since Isabel needs to bake 2 more brownies, she will need more flour. Let's calculate how much more flour she needs:

* 2 brownies x 5 cups/brownie = 10 cups of flour

Step 4: Isabel already used 15 cups of flour, and she needs 10 more cups of flour. To find out how much flour she still needs, we subtract the amount she already used from the amount she needs:

* 10 cups (needed) - 15 cups (used) = -5 cups

Wait, what does a negative number mean in this context? It means Isabel has 5 cups of flour left over, which she doesn't need. To find the amount of flour she still needs, we can simply take the absolute value of the negative number:

* |-5 cups| = 5 cups

Step 5: Isabel still needs 5 cups of flour to complete her baking.

{The final answer is} 5 cups.<|eot_id|>",10

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial amount of tickets Tom has
Tom bought 40 tickets, so he has 40 tickets initially.

Step 2: Identify the amount of tickets Tom spent at the ""dunk a clown"" booth
Tom spent 28 tickets at the booth.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining tickets after spending at the booth
To find the remaining tickets, subtract the amount spent at the booth from the initial amount:
40 (initial tickets) - 28 (tickets spent) = 12 tickets

Step 4: Determine how many rides Tom can go on
Each ride costs 4 tickets, so to find out how many rides Tom can go on, divide the remaining tickets by 4:
12 (remaining tickets) Ã· 4 (tickets per ride) = 3

Step 1: We are told that there were 31 students at the start of the year. This is our initial number of students.

Step 2: During the year, 5 students left. To find the new number of students, we subtract 5 from the initial number:

31 - 5 = 26

So, there are 26 students left.

Step 3: Then, 11 new students came to school. To find the new total number of students, we add the 11 new students to the 26 students who remained:

26 + 11 = 37

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Adam answered 8 questions correctly in the first half and 2 questions correctly in the second half.

Step 2: Determine the total number of questions Adam answered.
The problem doesn't specify the total number of questions, but we can infer it from the information given. Since Adam answered 8 questions correctly in the first half, that means he attempted at least 8 questions in the first half. Similarly, since he answered 2 questions correctly in the second half, that means he attempted at least 2 questions in the second half. Therefore, the total number of questions Adam answered is at least 8 + 2 = 10.

Step 3: Calculate the total points Adam scored.
Each question is worth 8 points, so Adam scored 8 points for each of the 8 correct answers in the first half. That's a total of 8 x 8 = 64 points. In the second half, Adam scored 8 points for each of the 2 correct answers. That's a total of 8 x 2 = 16 points. Therefore, Adam's total score is 64 + 16 = 80 points.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of chicken wings cooked by the chef.
The chef had 8 chicken wings cooked initially, and then cooked 10 more. To find the total number of chicken wings cooked, we add these two numbers together:
8 (initially cooked) + 10 (additional wings) = 18

Step 2: Determine how many chicken wings each person will get.
Since there are 3 friends, and they each get the same amount, we need to divide the total number of chicken wings (18) by 3:
18 Ã· 3 = 6

Step 3: Confirm the answer.
Each person will get 6 chicken wings. This makes sense, as the chef cooked a total of 18 wings and divided them equally among the 3 friends.

                     There school's baseball : team had ; 2 new players and 6 returning? players. If the coach ; put? them : into! groups with 4 players in each group, how many groups would : there? be?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of players on the team.
The school's baseball team has 2 new players and 6 returning players. To find the total number of players, we add these two numbers together:
2 (new players) + 6 (returning players) = 8 players

Step 2: Determine the number of groups with 4 players in each group.
We want to know how many groups of 4 players we can make from the total number of players. To do this, we divide the total number of players (8) by the number of players in each group (4):

8 players Ã· 4 players/group = 2 groups

Step 3: Verify the answer.
Since we divided the total number of players (8) by the number of players in each group (4), we can be sure that the answer is correct. We would have 2 groups of 4 players each.

{The final answer is 2 groups.}<|eot_id|>",2

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     ; A painter needed to paint : 6 rooms in a building. Each room, takes. 5 hours to paint. If he, already painted, 2 rooms, how much longer? will he take to paint? the. rest? ;<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of rooms that need to be painted.
The painter needs to paint 6 rooms in total.

Step 2: Determine the number of rooms that have already been painted.
The painter has already painted 2 rooms.

Step 3: Calculate the number of rooms that still need to be painted.
To find the number of rooms that still need to be painted, subtract the number of rooms already painted from the total number of rooms:
6 (total rooms) - 2 (rooms already painted) = 4

Step 4: Calculate the time it takes to paint each room.
Each room takes 5 hours to paint.

Step 5: Calculate the total time it takes to paint the rooms that still need to be painted.
Since 4 rooms still need to be painted, multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to paint each room:
4 (rooms) Ã— 5 (hours per room) = 20 hours

Step 6: Calculate the time it takes to paint the rooms that have already been painted.
Since 2 rooms have already been painted, multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to paint each room:
2 (rooms) Ã— 5 (hours per room) = 10 hours

Step 7: Calculate the total time it takes to paint all the rooms.
Add the time it takes to paint the rooms that still need to be painted to the time it takes to paint the rooms that have already been painted:
20 hours (rooms that still need to be painted) + 10 hours (rooms that have already been painted) = 30 hours

Step 8: Calculate the time it will take to paint the rest of the rooms.
Since the painter has already painted 2 rooms, he still needs to paint 4 rooms. To find the time it will take to paint the rest of the rooms, subtract the time it takes to paint the rooms that have already been painted from the total time it takes to paint all the rooms:
30 hours (total time) - 10 hours (rooms that have already been painted) = 20 hours

{The final answer is 20 hours.}<|eot_id|>",20

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The waiter had 22 customers initially.

Step 2: 14 of them left, which means the number of customers remaining is:
22 - 14 = 8

Step 3: The problem states that the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table. Since the number of customers remaining is 8, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:
Number of tables Ã— Number of people per table = Total number of customers remaining
Let's say the number of tables is x. Then, the equation becomes:
x Ã— 4 = 8

Step 4: Solve the equation for x:
x = 8 Ã· 4
x = 2

Step 5: Therefore, the waiter had 2 tables with 4 people at each table.

Step 2: He put 48 pieces in one load, leaving him with:

120 - 48 = 72

pieces of clothing remaining.

Step 3: He decided to split the remaining 72 pieces into 9 equal loads.

To find the number of pieces that can go in each small load, we can divide the remaining 72 pieces by 9:

72 Ã· 9 = 8

So, 8 pieces of clothing can go in each of the small loads.

{The final answer is 8}.<|eot_id|>",8

Step 2: Identify the number of students who left.
The problem states that 4 students left during the year.

Step 3: Subtract the number of students who left from the initial number of students.
10 (initial students) - 4 (students who left) = 6

So, there were 6 students remaining in fourth grade after some students left.

Step 4: Identify the number of new students who joined.
The problem states that 42 new students came to school during the year.

Step 5: Add the number of new students who joined to the remaining students.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Roger is helping to put away books at the library. A librarian takes 2 books away, leaving Roger with the rest.

Step 2: Determine the number of books left
Roger started with 14 books, and the librarian took 2 away. To find the number of books left, subtract 2 from 14:

14 - 2 = 12

So, Roger has 12 books left.

Step 3: Determine how many books can fit on a shelf
Roger can fit 3 books on a shelf.

Step 4: Divide the number of books left by the number of books that can fit on a shelf
To find the number of shelves Roger needs, divide the number of books left (12) by the number of books that can fit on a shelf (3):

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the total number of students on the debate team.
The schools! debate team had! 26 boys ; and 46 : girls on it.

We can combine the numbers to get the total number of students:
26 (boys) + 46 (girls) = 72 students

Step 2: Determine the number of groups that can be formed with 9 students in each group.
To find the number of groups, we can divide the total number of students (72) by the number of students in each group (9):

72 Ã· 9 = 8

Step 3: Check if there are any remaining students.
Since 72 is divisible by 9, we can form 8 groups of 9 students each. However, we need to check if there are any remaining students. Since 72 is not a multiple of 9, there will be some students left over.

Step 4: Calculate the remaining students.
To find the remaining students, we can subtract the total number of students in the groups (8 Ã— 9 = 72) from the total number of students (72):

72 - 72 = 0

There are no remaining students, which means that we can form exactly 8 groups of 9 students each.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of red apples and green apples ordered.
The cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples.

Step 2: Determine the total number of apples ordered.
The total number of apples ordered is the sum of the red and green apples: 6 (red) + 15 (green) = 21 apples.

Step 3: Identify the number of students who wanted fruit.
Only 5 students wanted fruit.

Step 4: Calculate the number of apples that would be needed to satisfy the demand of the 5 students.
Since each student wants fruit, the cafeteria needs to provide at least one apple per student. Therefore, the minimum number of apples needed is 5 apples (one apple per student).

Step 5: Calculate the number of extra apples the cafeteria has after providing fruit to the 5 students.
The cafeteria had 21 apples initially. After providing 5 apples to the students, the remaining number of apples is:
21 (initial apples) - 5 (apples given to students) = 16 apples

Step 6: Determine the number of extra apples the cafeteria has.
The cafeteria has 16 apples remaining after providing fruit to the 5 students. This means they have 16 - 5 = 11 extra apples.

4 - 3 = 1

So, after selling 3 books, there are 1 book left in the bin.

Step 3: The store then put 10 more books in the bin.

                    question:
                     Mike made 42 dollars? mowing! lawns ; over the summer. If, he spent 10? dollars buying new mower? blades, how many. 8 dollar games could he buy. with the money he. had. left?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the amount of money Mike made mowing lawns.
Mike made 42 dollars mowing lawns.

Step 2: Identify the amount of money Mike spent on new mower blades.
Mike spent 10 dollars buying new mower blades.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Mike had left after spending on new mower blades.
To find out how much money Mike had left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he made. So, we subtract 10 dollars from 42 dollars:

42 dollars - 10 dollars = 32 dollars

Step 4: Determine how many 8-dollar games Mike can buy with the money he has left.
Since each game costs 8 dollars, we can divide the amount of money Mike has left (32 dollars) by 8 dollars to find out how many games he can buy:

32 dollars Ã· 8 dollars = 4

{The final answer is} Mike can buy 4 games with the money he has left.<|eot_id|>",4

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given
- The chef needs to cook 13 potatoes.
- He has already cooked 5 potatoes.
- Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

Step 2: Calculate the number of potatoes left to cook
- The chef has already cooked 5 potatoes, so he needs to cook:
13 (total potatoes) - 5 (already cooked) = 8 potatoes

Step 3: Calculate the total time taken to cook the already cooked potatoes
- The chef has already cooked 5 potatoes, and each potato takes 6 minutes to cook. So, the total time taken to cook the already cooked potatoes is:
5 (already cooked potatoes) x 6 (minutes per potato) = 30 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the time taken to cook the remaining potatoes
- The chef needs to cook 8 potatoes, and each potato takes 6 minutes to cook. So, the total time taken to cook the remaining potatoes is:
8 (remaining potatoes) x 6 (minutes per potato) = 48 minutes

Step 5: Add the time taken to cook the already cooked potatoes to the time taken to cook the remaining potatoes
- The chef took 30 minutes to cook the already cooked potatoes, and 48 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes. So, the total time taken to cook all the potatoes is:
30 minutes (already cooked) + 48 minutes (remaining) = 78 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of trays Jerry needs to pick up from each table.

* From one table, Jerry needs to pick up 9 trays.
* From another table, Jerry needs to pick up 7 trays.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of trays Jerry needs to pick up.

* 9 trays from one table + 7 trays from another table = 9 + 7 = 16 trays

Step 3: Determine how many trays Jerry can carry at a time.

* Jerry can only carry 8 trays at a time.

Step 4: Calculate the number of trips Jerry will need to make to carry all the trays.

* To carry 16 trays, Jerry will need to make trips until he has carried a total of 16 trays.
* Since Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, he will need to make trips until he has carried a total of 16 trays.
* To find the number of trips, divide the total number of trays (16) by the number of trays Jerry can carry at a time (8).

16 Ã· 8 = 2

Step 5: Check if Jerry needs to make any additional trips to pick up the remaining trays.

* Jerry will need to make 2 trips to carry 16 trays, but he still needs to pick up 16 trays.
* Since Jerry can only carry 8 trays at a time, he will need to make an additional trip to pick up the remaining 8 trays.

Step 1: Determine the initial number of apples.
The cafeteria had 50 apples.

Step 2: Determine how many apples were handed out to students.
5 apples were handed out to students.

Step 3: Subtract the number of apples handed out from the initial number of apples.
50 apples - 5 apples = 45 apples

Step 4: Determine how many pies can be made using the remaining apples.
Each pie takes 5 apples, so to find the number of pies that can be made, we can divide the remaining apples by 5.

45 apples Ã· 5 apples per pie = 9 pies

Step 5: State the final answer.
{The final answer is 9 pies.}<|eot_id|>",9

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Oliver starts with $33 in January.

Step 2: By March, he has spent $4, so we need to subtract $4 from the initial amount:

$33 - $4 = $29

So, Oliver has $29 left.

Step 3: He receives $32 from his mom, so we add this amount to the remaining $29:

$29 + $32 = $61

Step 4: Finally, we find the total amount of money Oliver has after receiving the $32 from his mom:

$61

{The final answer is $61}.<|eot_id|>",61

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The school cafeteria had 14 apples initially.

Step 2: They used 13 apples to make lunch for the students. To find out how many apples they have left, we subtract 13 from 14:

14 - 13 = 1

So, they have 1 apple left after using 13 for lunch.

Step 3: Then, they bought 49 more apples. To find the total number of apples they have now, we add the 1 apple they had left to the 49 new apples:

1 + 49 = 50

The final answer is:

* Frank answered 2 questions correct in the second half.
* Each question was worth 3 points.

Step 2: Calculate the total points Frank earned in the first half.

* Frank answered 3 questions correct in the first half, so he earned 3 x 3 = 9 points in the first half.

Step 3: Calculate the total points Frank earned in the second half.

* Frank answered 2 questions correct in the second half, so he earned 2 x 3 = 6 points in the second half.

Step 4: Calculate Frank's total score.

* Frank earned 9 points in the first half and 6 points in the second half, so his total score is 9 + 6 = 15 points.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Zoe found 8 boxes of clothing, and inside each box, there are:
	* 4 scarves
	* 6 mittens

Step 2: Calculate the total number of scarves.
Since there are 4 scarves in each box, and there are 8 boxes, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves per box:
	* 8 boxes Ã— 4 scarves/box = 32 scarves

Step 3: Calculate the total number of mittens.
Similarly, since there are 6 mittens in each box, and there are 8 boxes, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of mittens per box:
	* 8 boxes Ã— 6 mittens/box = 48 mittens

Step 4: Calculate the total number of pieces of winter clothing.
To find the total number of pieces, we add the number of scarves and mittens:
	* 32 scarves + 48 mittens = 80 pieces of winter clothing

Step 5: Write the final answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the variables

* Frank bought 3 decks
* His friend bought 2 decks
* Each deck costs 7 dollars

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of Frank's decks

* Frank bought 3 decks, and each deck costs 7 dollars
* To find the total cost, multiply the number of decks by the cost per deck: 3 decks x 7 dollars/deck = 21 dollars

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of his friend's decks

* His friend bought 2 decks, and each deck costs 7 dollars
* To find the total cost, multiply the number of decks by the cost per deck: 2 decks x 7 dollars/deck = 14 dollars

Step 4: Add the total costs of Frank's and his friend's decks

* Frank's decks cost 21 dollars
* His friend's decks cost 14 dollars
* To find the total cost, add the two amounts together: 21 dollars + 14 dollars = 35 dollars

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of shirts Sam had to wash.
Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts.
To find the total number of shirts, we add the two numbers together:
40 + 23 = 63

Step 2: Identify the number of shirts Sam washed before school started.
Sam washed 29 shirts by the time school started.

Step 3: Find the number of shirts Sam did not wash.
To find the number of shirts Sam did not wash, we subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts he had to wash:
63 (total shirts) - 29 (shirts washed) =?

Step 4: Calculate the number of shirts Sam did not wash.
