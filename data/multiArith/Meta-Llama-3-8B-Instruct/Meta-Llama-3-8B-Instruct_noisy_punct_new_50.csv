                    question:
                   .  Paige, had 11. songs on her. mp3 player. If! she deleted 9 old songs! from : it, and then. added : 8 new. songs, how, many : songs, does she! have? on her mp3 player? :<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player initially.

Step 2: She deleted 9 old songs from it. To find the number of songs she has left, we subtract 9 from 11:

11 - 9 = 2

So, Paige has 2 songs left on her mp3 player after deleting 9 old songs.

Step 3: She then added 8 new songs to her mp3 player. To find the total number of songs she has now, we add 2 (the number of songs left) to 8 (the number of new songs added):

2 + 8 = 10

Step 4: Therefore, Paige now has 10 songs on her mp3 player.

{The final answer is 10 songs.}<|eot_id|>",10

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
We have a total of 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the basketball team. We need to find out how many students didn't make the cut.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of students trying out
We can add the number of girls and boys to get the total number of students trying out:
39 (girls) + 4 (boys) = 43 students

Step 3: Find out how many students got called back
According to the problem, 26 students got called back.

Step 4: Find out how many students didn't make the cut
To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we need to subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students trying out:
43 (total students) - 26 (students who got called back) = 17 students

{The final answer is 17 students didn't make the cut.}<|eot_id|>",17

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Faye starts with 34 coloring books.

Step 2: She gives away 3 of them, which means she has 34 - 3 = 31 coloring books left.

Step 3: Then, she buys 48 more coloring books.

Step 4: To find the total number of coloring books she has now, we add the 31 she had left after giving some away to the 48 she bought:

31 + 48 = 79

Step 5: Therefore, Faye would have a total of 79 coloring books.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of apples the school cafeteria had.
The problem states that the school cafeteria had 23 apples.

Step 2: Determine how many apples were used to make lunch for the students.
The problem states that 20 apples were used to make lunch for the students.

Step 3: Subtract the number of apples used from the initial number of apples.
To find out how many apples are left, we subtract the number of apples used (20) from the initial number of apples (23):

23 - 20 = 3

So, the school cafeteria has 3 apples left.

Step 4: Determine how many more apples the school cafeteria bought.
The problem states that they bought 6 more apples.

Step 5: Add the number of apples bought to the number of apples left.
To find the total number of apples the school cafeteria now has, we add the number of apples left (3) to the number of apples bought (6):

3 + 6 = 9

So, the school cafeteria now has 9 apples.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
Each enemy defeated gives you 9 points.
There are 11 enemies in total.
You destroy all but 3 of them.

Step 2: Calculate the number of enemies you destroy.
You destroy all but 3 of the 11 enemies, so you destroy 11 - 3 = 8 enemies.

Step 3: Calculate the points you earn from destroying the enemies.
Each enemy gives you 9 points, so you earn 8 x 9 = 72 points from destroying the 8 enemies.

Step 4: Consider the remaining 3 enemies that you didn't destroy.
You didn't destroy these enemies, so you don't earn any points from them.

Step 5: Add the points you earned from destroying the enemies to the points you didn't earn from the remaining enemies.
You earned 72 points from destroying the 8 enemies, and you didn't earn any points from the remaining 3 enemies. Therefore, your total points are 72.

* Megan earned 8 points for each bag of cans recycled.
* She had 14 bags, but didn't recycle 5 of them.

Step 2: Determine how many bags Megan actually recycled.

* Since she didn't recycle 5 bags, she must have recycled the remaining bags. To find out how many bags she recycled, subtract the number of bags she didn't recycle from the total number of bags: 14 - 5 = 9 bags

Step 3: Calculate the total number of points Megan earned.

* Since Megan earned 8 points for each bag of cans recycled, multiply the number of bags she recycled by 8: 9 bags x 8 points/bag = 72 points

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
April is having a sale where each rose is $4. She started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left. We need to find out how much money she earned.

Step 2: Identify the key information
* April started with 13 roses
* She had 4 roses left, which means she sold 13 - 4 = 9 roses
* Each rose is $4

Step 3: Calculate the total amount earned
Since April sold 9 roses, and each rose is $4, we can calculate the total amount earned as:
9 roses x $4 per rose = $36

Step 4: Confirm the answer
April started with 13 roses and sold 9 of them, leaving her with 4 roses. She earned a total of $36. This makes sense, as she sold 9 roses at $4 each, which would give her $36.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The company invited 47 people to a luncheon, but 7 of them didn't show up. We need to find out how many tables they need, assuming each table can hold 5 people.

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who actually showed up
47 (total people invited) - 7 (people who didn't show up) = 40 people who showed up

Step 3: Calculate the number of tables needed
To find the number of tables needed, we need to divide the number of people who showed up by the number of people each table can hold.

40 people ÷ 5 people per table = 8 tables

Step 4: Conclusion
The company needs 8 tables for the luncheon.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Tom had 5 books initially.

Step 2: He sold 4 of them, which means he is left with:

5 - 4 = 1 book

Step 3: Tom used the money he earned from selling the 4 books to buy new books. Let's assume the money he earned is equal to the number of books he sold (4). So, he bought:

4 new books

Step 4: Tom already had 1 book left after selling 4. Now, he adds the 4 new books he bought to his collection:

1 (initial book) + 4 (new books) = 5 books

Step 5: Tom also bought 38 new books using the money he earned. So, his total book collection now is:

5 (previous books) + 38 (new books) = 43 books

{The final answer is} 43 books.<|eot_id|>",39

* This means she has 41 - 29 = 12 seeds left.

Step 2: Emily put 4 seeds in each of her small gardens.

* Since she has 12 seeds left, we need to find out how many groups of 4 seeds she can make with those 12 seeds.
* To do this, we can divide 12 by 4: 12 ÷ 4 = 3.

Step 3: This means Emily can make 3 groups of 4 seeds each.

* Since each group represents a small garden, Emily has 3 small gardens.

Emily received 5 pieces of candy from her neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister. To find the total amount of candy, we add these two numbers together:

5 + 13 = 18

So, Emily received a total of 18 pieces of candy.

Step 2: Identify how many pieces of candy Emily eats per day.
Emily eats 9 pieces of candy per day.

Step 3: Calculate how many days the candy will last.
To find out how many days the candy will last, we need to divide the total amount of candy (18) by the number of pieces Emily eats per day (9).

18 ÷ 9 = 2

So, the candy will last Emily for 2 days.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of books left after the librarian takes 10 books away.

There are 82 books initially, and the librarian takes 10 away. To find the number of books left, we subtract 10 from 82:

82 - 10 = 72

So, Mike has 72 books left.

Step 2: Determine how many books Mike can fit on each shelf.

According to the problem, Mike can fit 9 books on each shelf.

Step 3: Divide the number of books left by the number of books Mike can fit on each shelf.

To find the number of shelves needed, we divide the number of books left (72) by the number of books Mike can fit on each shelf (9):

72 ÷ 9 = 8

So, Mike will need 8 shelves to put away the remaining books.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the total number of pictures Nancy took initially.
Nancy took 49 pictures at the zoo and 8 pictures at the museum, so the total number of pictures she took is:
49 + 8 = 57

Step 2: Identify the number of pictures Nancy deleted.
Nancy deleted 38 pictures.

Step 3: Find the number of pictures Nancy still has by subtracting the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures.
57 (initial total) - 38 (deleted) = 19

Step 4: Check the answer to make sure it makes sense.
It's reasonable to assume that Nancy wouldn't delete more pictures than she took, so 19 is a plausible answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
The builder has already installed 8 windows, and there are a total of 14 windows needed.

Step 2: Calculate the number of windows left to be installed
To find the number of windows left to be installed, subtract the number of windows already installed (8) from the total number of windows needed (14):

14 (total windows) - 8 (already installed) = 6

So, there are 6 windows left to be installed.

Step 3: Calculate the time taken to install each window
It takes 8 hours to install each window.

Step 4: Calculate the total time taken to install the remaining windows
To find the total time taken to install the remaining windows, multiply the number of windows left to be installed (6) by the time taken to install each window (8 hours):

6 (windows) x 8 (hours) = 48 hours

So, it will take 48 hours to install the remaining 6 windows.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the initial situation
The store had 40 oranges in a bin.

Step 2: Understand the action taken
They threw away 25 old oranges (which means they removed 25 oranges from the bin).

Step 3: Update the number of oranges in the bin
After throwing away 25 old oranges, the number of oranges in the bin is reduced by 25. So, we subtract 25 from the initial 40 oranges:

40 - 25 = 15

Step 4: Understand the next action
They put 21 new oranges in the bin.

Step 5: Update the number of oranges in the bin
The 21 new oranges are added to the remaining 15 oranges in the bin. So, we add 21 to the updated number:

15 + 21 = 36

Step 6: Determine the final number of oranges in the bin
The bin now contains 36 oranges.

{The final answer is 36 oranges in the bin.}<|eot_id|>",36

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
The waiter had 7 customers at lunch.
5 of them didn't leave a tip.

Step 2: Identify the unknown variable
The amount of money the waiter earned from the tips.

Step 3: Calculate the number of customers who left a tip
Since 5 customers didn't leave a tip, the number of customers who left a tip is:
7 (total customers) - 5 (customers who didn't leave a tip) = 2 customers

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money earned from tips
The waiter got $3 each from the customers who left a tip. Since there were 2 customers who left a tip, the total amount of money earned from tips is:
2 (customers who left a tip) x $3 (per customer) = $6

Step 5: The final answer
The waiter earned a total of $6 from the tips.

* A group of 4 friends went into a restaurant.
* The chef already had 9 chicken wings cooked.
* The chef cooked 7 more chicken wings for the group.
* Each person got the same amount.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of chicken wings

* The chef started with 9 chicken wings.
* He cooked 7 more, so the total number of chicken wings is:
9 (initial wings) + 7 (additional wings) = 16 chicken wings

Step 3: Divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of people

* There are 4 friends in the group.
* To find out how many chicken wings each person gets, we divide the total number of chicken wings by 4:
16 (total wings) ÷ 4 (number of people) = 4 wings per person

Step 2: Calculate the total number of lawns John actually mowed
John had 15 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 7 of them. To find the number of lawns he actually mowed, we subtract 7 from 15:

15 - 7 = 8

So, John actually mowed 8 lawns.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money John earned
John earned $8 for each lawn he mowed. To find the total amount of money he earned, we multiply the number of lawns he mowed by the amount he earned per lawn:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of puppies at the shelter.

The problem states that the shelter had 5 puppies initially.

Step 2: Add the new puppies brought in to the initial number.

The problem states that 35 more puppies were brought in, so we add this to the initial number:

5 (initial puppies) + 35 (new puppies) = 40 puppies

Step 3: Calculate the total number of puppies at the shelter.

We now have a total of 40 puppies at the shelter.

Step 4: Determine the rate at which puppies are being adopted.

The problem states that 8 puppies are being adopted per day.

Step 5: Calculate the time it would take for all puppies to be adopted.

To do this, we need to divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies being adopted per day:

40 puppies ÷ 8 puppies per day = 5 days

* 9 (total windows needed) - 6 (already installed) = 3 windows remaining

Step 3: Identify the time it takes to install one window
* It takes 6 hours to install one window.

Step 4: Calculate the total time it will take to install the remaining windows
* Since it takes 6 hours to install one window, it will take 6 hours to install 1 window.
* To install 2 windows, it will take 2 x 6 = 12 hours.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of adults and kids in the group.
There are 13 people in the group, and 9 of them are kids. To find the number of adults, we subtract the number of kids from the total number of people:
13 (total people) - 9 (kids) = 4 adults

Step 2: Determine the cost of each adult meal.
Each adult meal costs $7.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of adult meals.
There are 4 adults, and each meal costs $7. To find the total cost of adult meals, we multiply the number of adults by the cost of each meal:
4 (adults) x $7 (per meal) = $28

Step 4: Determine the cost of each kid's meal.
Since kids eat for free, the cost of each kid's meal is $0.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of kid's meals.
There are 9 kids, and each meal costs $0. To find the total cost of kid's meals, we multiply the number of kids by the cost of each meal:
9 (kids) x $0 (per meal) = $0

Step 6: Add the total cost of adult meals and kid's meals to find the total cost for the group.
The total cost of adult meals is $28, and the total cost of kid's meals is $0. To find the total cost for the group, we add these amounts together:
$28 (adult meals) + $0 (kid's meals) = $28

Step 1: Identify the total number of pictures Wendy uploaded, which is 79.

Step 2: Identify the number of pictures that Wendy put into one album, which is 44.

Step 3: Subtract the number of pictures in one album from the total number of pictures to find the number of pictures that Wendy put into the remaining 5 albums.

79 (total pictures) - 44 (pictures in one album) = 35

Step 4: Divide the number of pictures in the remaining albums (35) by the number of albums (5) to find the number of pictures in each album.

35 ÷ 5 = 7

Step 5: Combine the number of pictures in the one album (44) with the number of pictures in each of the remaining albums (7) to find the total number of pictures in each album.

44 + 7 = 51

Step 6: Since Wendy put the remaining pictures into 5 different albums, we need to divide the total number of pictures in each album (51) by the number of albums (5) to find the number of pictures in each album.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the number of students on the debate team.
The schools debate team had 45 boys and 40 girls, so the total number of students is:
45 (boys) + 40 (girls) = 85 students

Step 2: Determine the number of groups of 9 students that can be formed.
To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of students (85) by the number of students in each group (9).

85 (total students) ÷ 9 (students per group) = 9.44 (round down to the nearest whole number, since you can't have a fraction of a group)

Step 3: Calculate the number of groups that can be formed.
Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can form:

9 groups

Step 4: Check the calculation.
Let's verify that the calculation is correct. If we have 85 students and we form 9 groups of 9 students each, we can calculate the total number of students in these groups:

9 groups × 9 students per group = 81 students

This leaves 4 students remaining (85 - 81 = 4). Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can't include these remaining students in the calculation. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

{The final answer is 9 groups.}<|eot_id|>",5

April started with 9 roses.

Step 3: Determine the number of roses April has left
April has 4 roses left.

Step 4: Calculate the number of roses April sold
To find the number of roses April sold, subtract the number of roses left from the original number of roses:
9 roses - 4 roses = 5 roses

Step 5: Calculate the total amount April earned
Since each rose is $7, multiply the number of roses sold by the price of each rose:
5 roses x $7/rose = $35

Step 6: Determine the amount April earned
The amount April earned is the total amount calculated in Step 5:
$35

Step 1: Identify the number of members who didn't show up.
The problem states that 6 members didn't show up.

Step 2: Identify the number of members who did show up.
The problem states that the trivia team had 11 members total. Since 6 members didn't show up, the number of members who did show up is:
11 (total members) - 6 (members who didn't show up) = 5

Step 3: Identify the number of points scored by each member who showed up.
The problem states that each member who showed up scored 9 points.

Step 4: Calculate the total points scored by the members who showed up.
Since 5 members showed up, and each scored 9 points, the total points scored by the members who showed up is:
5 (members) x 9 (points per member) = 45

Step 5: Determine the total points scored.
The total points scored is the sum of the points scored by the members who showed up, which is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of people going on the field trip.
We are told that there are 12 students and 3 adults going. To find the total number of people, we add these numbers together:

12 students + 3 adults = 15 people

Step 2: Determine the capacity of each van.
We are told that each van can hold 5 people.

Step 3: Divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van.
To find out how many vans they will need, we divide the total number of people (15) by the capacity of each van (5):

15 people ÷ 5 people per van = 3 vans

Step 4: Check if there are any remaining people.
Since we divided the total number of people by the capacity of each van, we can check if there are any remaining people. In this case, there are no remaining people, as the number of vans needed (3) exactly divides the total number of people (15).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of sodas Tom bought.

Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. To find the total number of sodas, we add these two numbers together:

4 (regular sodas) + 52 (diet sodas) = 56 sodas

Step 2: Determine how many sodas can fit on each shelf.

The problem states that Tom's fridge can hold 7 sodas on each shelf.

Step 3: Divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

To find out how many shelves Tom will fill up, we divide the total number of sodas (56) by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf (7):

56 ÷ 7 = 8

Step 4: Determine the number of shelves Tom will fill up.

Since Tom can fit 7 sodas on each shelf, and he has 56 sodas in total, he will fill up 8 shelves.

Step 1: Henry already has 3 action figures, but he needs a total of 8 to complete his collection. This means he needs to buy 8 - 3 = 5 more action figures.

Step 2: Each action figure costs $6, so to find the total cost of the additional 5 action figures, we multiply the number of action figures by the cost per action figure: 5 x $6 = $30.

Step 3: Henry already has 3 action figures, and he needs to buy 5 more to complete his collection. Therefore, he will need to spend $30 to buy the additional 5 action figures.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
Frank had saved up 3? dollars.
This means that Frank had an unknown amount of money, which we'll represent as?.

Step 2: Determine what happens next.
He received another 37 dollars for his allowance.
This adds 37 dollars to the amount Frank had saved up.

Step 3: Calculate the new total amount Frank has.
Frank had? dollars initially, and then received 37 more dollars. To find the new total, we add the two amounts together:
? + 37 =?

Step 4: Determine what the problem is asking.
The problem asks how many 8-dollar toys Frank can buy.
This means we need to divide the new total amount Frank has by 8, to find out how many times 8 dollars fits into the total amount.

Step 5: Perform the division.
Using the result from Step 3, we divide the new total amount by 8:
(? + 37) ÷ 8 =?

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    , Vanessa and her mom, were picking : carrots. from their garden. Vanessa ; picked ; 17. and ; her, mother picked 14. If : only : 24 : of ; the carrots were good,? how! many bad! carrots, did they have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Vanessa and her mom picked a total of 17 + 14 = 31 carrots.

Step 2: Identify the condition given in the problem.
Only 24 of the carrots are good.

Step 3: Determine the total number of carrots.
Since only 24 are good, the remaining carrots must be bad. Let's call the total number of carrots ""x"".

Step 4: Write an equation to represent the situation.
We know that the total number of carrots is the sum of the good carrots and the bad carrots. Since only 24 are good, the bad carrots must be x - 24.

We can set up the equation as follows:
x = 17 + 14 + (x - 24)

Step 5: Simplify the equation.
Combine like terms:
x = 31 + (x - 24)
x = 31 + x - 24
x = 31 - 24 + x
x = 7 + x

Step 6: Solve for x.
Subtract x from both sides:
7 = -x

Step 7: Determine the number of bad carrots.
Since x is the total number of carrots, and we subtracted 24 good carrots, the number of bad carrots is x - 24. We can substitute the value of x from Step 6:
x - 24 = 7 - 24
= -17

{The final answer is -17 bad carrots.}

Note that the problem asks for the number of bad carrots, which is a negative value. This is because the problem is asking for the number of carrots that are not good, and the negative sign indicates that these carrots are not good.<|eot_id|>",7

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of people participating in the game.
We know there are 23 managers and 7 employees, so we add these numbers together to get:
23 (managers) + 7 (employees) = 30

Step 2: Determine the number of teams.
The problem states that they will split into 6 teams.

Step 3: Calculate the number of people on each team.
To do this, we divide the total number of people (30) by the number of teams (6).

30 ÷ 6 = 5

So, there would be 5 people on each team.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Tiffany baked 8 brownies, but she needs a total of 17 brownies for her party. She used 8 cups of flour for each brownie. We need to find out how much flour she still needs.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of flour used
Since Tiffany used 8 cups of flour for each brownie, and she baked 8 brownies, she used a total of:
8 brownies x 8 cups/brownie = 64 cups of flour

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of flour needed
Tiffany needs a total of 17 brownies, and she already has 8 brownies. To find the total amount of flour needed, we subtract the amount of flour used from the total amount of flour needed:
17 brownies x 8 cups/brownie = 136 cups of flour (total needed)
- 64 cups of flour (used)
= 72 cups of flour (still needed)

Step 4: Determine how much flour Tiffany still needs
Since Tiffany needs 72 cups of flour, and she already has 64 cups, she still needs:
72 cups - 64 cups = 8 cups of flour

{The final answer is 8 cups of flour.}<|eot_id|>",72

Carol and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. They picked a total of 29 + 16 = 45 carrots.

Step 2: Understand the condition
Only 38 out of the total carrots picked are good. This means that the remaining carrots are bad.

Step 3: Calculate the total good carrots
There are 38 good carrots out of the total 45 carrots picked.

Step 4: Calculate the total bad carrots
To find the total bad carrots, subtract the good carrots from the total carrots:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that a teacher has 17 worksheets to grade, and she has already graded 8 of them. We need to find out how many problems she has left to grade.

Step 2: Identify the number of problems on each worksheet
The problem statement mentions that each worksheet has 7 problems. We can use this information to calculate the total number of problems on all 17 worksheets.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of problems on all 17 worksheets
Each worksheet has 7 problems, so the total number of problems on all 17 worksheets is:
17 worksheets x 7 problems per worksheet = 119 problems

Step 4: Calculate the number of problems already graded
The teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, and each worksheet has 7 problems. So, the number of problems already graded is:
8 worksheets x 7 problems per worksheet = 56 problems

Step 5: Calculate the number of problems left to grade
To find the number of problems left to grade, we subtract the number of problems already graded from the total number of problems on all 17 worksheets:

80 - 31 = 49

So, Nancy has 49 files left.

Step 3: She put the remaining files into folders, with 7 files in each folder.

To find out how many folders she needs, we divide the number of remaining files (49) by the number of files per folder (7):

49 ÷ 7 = 7

Step 4: Since we can't put a fraction of a file into a folder, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round up 7.333... to 7.

Step 3: Calculate the number of students who were put into groups.
The total number of students is 65, and 17 didn't get picked, so the number of students who were put into groups is:
65 - 17 = 48 students

Step 4: Identify the number of groups.
There are 8 groups.

Step 5: Calculate the number of students in each group.
To find the number of students in each group, we can divide the total number of students in groups (48) by the number of groups (8):
48 ÷ 8 = 6

So, there would be 6 students in each group.

{The final answer is 6 students in each group.}<|eot_id|>",6

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Isabel uploaded 25 pictures to Facebook.

Step 2: She put 10 pictures into one album.

Step 3: To find the number of pictures left, subtract the number of pictures in the first album (10) from the total number of pictures (25):

25 - 10 = 15

Step 4: The remaining 15 pictures are divided into 5 different albums.

Step 5: To find the number of pictures in each album, divide the remaining 15 pictures by the number of albums (5):

15 ÷ 5 = 3

Step 6: Since Isabel put 10 pictures into one album, and the remaining 15 pictures are divided into 5 albums, each album except the first one will have 3 pictures.

Step 7: The first album has 10 pictures, and the other albums have 3 pictures each.

{The final answer is: The first album has 10 pictures, and the other 4 albums have 3 pictures each.}<|eot_id|>",3

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total amount of money Mike has

Mike made $14 mowing lawns and $26 eating weeds, so he has a total of:

$14 + $26 = $40

Step 2: Calculate how much money Mike has left after spending $5 per week

Since Mike spends $5 per week, he will spend a total of:

$5 x number of weeks = total spent

We need to find out how many weeks the money will last, so we'll use the total amount of money Mike has ($40) and subtract the total spent (which is unknown).

Step 3: Set up an equation to represent the situation

Let x be the number of weeks the money will last. Then, the total spent can be represented as:

$5x

The total amount of money Mike has ($40) minus the total spent ($5x) will give us the amount of money Mike has left:

$40 - $5x = remaining money

Step 4: Solve for x

Since Mike has $40 initially and spends $5 per week, we can set up the equation:

$40 - $5x = remaining money

To find the number of weeks the money will last, we want to find the value of x that makes the remaining money equal to 0. In other words, we want to find the value of x that makes the money run out.

$40 - $5x = 0

Subtracting $40 from both sides gives us:

-$5x = -$40

Dividing both sides by -5 gives us:

x = 8

Step 5: Interpret the result

The result indicates that the money will last Mike for 8 weeks.<|eot_id|>",8

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of files on the flash drive.
Vanessa had 16 music files and 48 video files, so the total number of files is:
16 (music files) + 48 (video files) = 64 files

Step 2: Identify the number of files deleted.
Vanessa deleted 30 files.

Step 3: Subtract the number of deleted files from the total number of files.
To find the number of files still on the flash drive, we subtract the number of deleted files from the total number of files:
64 (total files) - 30 (deleted files) =?

Step 4: Perform the subtraction.
64 - 30 = 34

Step 5: Determine the final answer.
The number of files still on the flash drive is:

* Dave had to wash 9 short-sleeve shirts and 27 long-sleeve shirts before school.
* By the time school started, he had washed 20 shirts.

Step 2: Combine the number of short-sleeve shirts and long-sleeve shirts Dave had to wash.

* 9 short-sleeve shirts + 27 long-sleeve shirts = 36 shirts

Step 3: Subtract the number of shirts Dave had washed (20) from the total number of shirts he had to wash (36).

* 36 - 20 = 16

Step 4: Determine how many shirts Dave did not wash.

* Since he had washed 20 shirts, the number of shirts he did not wash is the difference between the total number of shirts he had to wash and the number of shirts he had washed.
* 16 shirts did not get washed.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The chef needs to cook 9 potatoes.
* He has already cooked 7 potatoes.

Step 2: Calculate the number of potatoes left to cook

* The chef has cooked 7 potatoes, so he still needs to cook 9 - 7 = 2 potatoes.

Step 3: Determine the time it takes to cook each potato

* Each potato takes 3 minutes to cook.

Step 4: Calculate the total time it takes to cook the remaining potatoes

* Since there are 2 potatoes left to cook, and each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, the total time it takes to cook the remaining potatoes is 2 x 3 = 6 minutes.

Step 5: Determine the total time it will take the chef to cook the rest of the potatoes

* The chef has already cooked 7 potatoes, which takes 7 x 3 = 21 minutes. Adding the time it takes to cook the remaining 2 potatoes, which is 6 minutes, the total time it will take the chef to cook the rest of the potatoes is 21 + 6 = 27 minutes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The florist had 50 roses initially.

Step 2: She sold 15% of them. To find the number of roses she sold, we need to calculate 15% of 50.

15% of 50 = (15/100) x 50 = 0.15 x 50 = 7.5

Since we can't sell a fraction of a rose, we'll round down to 7 roses (since 7.5 is closer to 7 than 8).

Step 3: The florist now has 50 - 7 = 43 roses left.

Step 4: Later, she picked 21 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we add the 21 new roses to the 43 roses she had left.

Kaleb had 12 dollars.

Step 2: Determine how much money Kaleb spent on the new game.
He spent 8 bucks on the game.

Step 3: Subtract the amount spent from the initial amount to find out how much money Kaleb has left.
12 dollars (initial amount) - 8 bucks (spent on game) =?

To subtract 8 bucks from 12 dollars, we need to convert the bucks to dollars. Since 1 buck is equal to 1 dollar, we can subtract 8 dollars directly.

12 dollars - 8 dollars = 4 dollars

Step 4: Determine how many 2-dollar toys Kaleb can buy with the money he has left.
To find out how many toys Kaleb can buy, we need to divide the amount of money he has left (4 dollars) by the cost of each toy (2 dollars).

4 dollars ÷ 2 dollars per toy =?

To divide, we can simply divide 4 by 2.

4 ÷ 2 = 2

Jerry made $14 from mowing lawns and $31 from eating weeds. To find the total amount of money Jerry has, we add these two amounts together:

$14 + $31 = $45

{So far, Jerry has a total of $45.}

Step 2: Identify how much Jerry spends each week
Jerry spends $5 per week.

Step 3: Find out how many weeks Jerry's money will last
To find out how many weeks Jerry's money will last, we need to divide the total amount of money Jerry has ($45) by the amount he spends each week ($5).

$45 ÷ $5 = 9

{The final answer is 9 weeks.}

So, Jerry's money will last him for 9 weeks.<|eot_id|>",9

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of members in the trivia team initially.
The problem states that the team had 14 members initially.

Step 2: Identify the number of members who didn't show up for the game.
The problem states that 7 members didn't show up.

Step 3: Calculate the number of members who did show up for the game.
To do this, we subtract the number of members who didn't show up from the total number of members:
14 (initial members) - 7 (didn't show up) = 7 members who did show up

Step 4: Identify the score each member who showed up scored.
The problem states that each member who showed up scored 5 points.

Step 5: Calculate the total score of the members who showed up.
Since there are 7 members who showed up, and each scored 5 points, we multiply the number of members by their score:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The trivia team has 5 members initially.
2. During the game, 2 members didn't show up. This means that only 5 - 2 = 3 members showed up.

3. Each member that showed up scored 6 points. Since there are 3 members, the total points scored by these members is:

3 members x 6 points per member = 18 points

4. Since we are looking for the total points scored, we need to add the points scored by the 3 members who showed up to the points that would have been scored by the 2 members who didn't show up.

5. However, we don't know how many points the 2 members who didn't show up would have scored, so we can't add their points to the total. We can only consider the points scored by the 3 members who did show up.

6. Therefore, the total points scored is the points scored by the 3 members who showed up, which is 18 points.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Oliver is helping at the library and needs to put away 46 books. A librarian takes 10 books away, leaving Oliver with the rest.

Step 2: Find the number of books Oliver has left
46 (initial number of books) - 10 (books taken away by the librarian) = 36 books left for Oliver

Step 3: Determine how many books can fit on a shelf
Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf.

Step 4: Divide the number of books left by the number of books that can fit on a shelf
36 (books left) ÷ 4 (books per shelf) = 9

Step 5: Determine the number of shelves needed
Since Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf, and he has 36 books left, he will need:

9 (shelves needed) x 4 (books per shelf) = 36 books

Luke has 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes.

Step 2: Determine the number of coins in each pile.
Each pile has 3 coins.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of coins in the piles of quarters.
Since there are 5 piles of quarters, each with 3 coins, the total number of coins in the piles of quarters is:
5 piles x 3 coins/pile = 15 coins

Step 4: Calculate the total number of coins in the piles of dimes.
Since there are 5 piles of dimes, each with 3 coins, the total number of coins in the piles of dimes is:
5 piles x 3 coins/pile = 15 coins

Step 5: Add the total number of coins in the piles of quarters and dimes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of boxes Kaleb bought initially.
Kaleb bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy.

Step 2: Identify the number of boxes Kaleb gave to his little brother.
Kaleb gave 5 boxes to his little brother.

Step 3: Calculate the number of boxes Kaleb has left after giving some away.
Kaleb had 14 boxes initially, and he gave away 5. To find the number of boxes he has left, subtract 5 from 14:
14 - 5 = 9

Step 4: Identify the number of pieces of candy in each box.
Each box has 6 pieces of candy inside.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of pieces of candy in the boxes Kaleb has left.
Since Kaleb has 9 boxes left, and each box has 6 pieces of candy, multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces per box:
9 boxes x 6 pieces per box = 54 pieces

Step 6: Calculate the total number of pieces of candy Kaleb has left.
Kaleb has 54 pieces of candy in the 9 boxes he has left.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of pictures Robin uploaded.
Robin uploaded 31 pictures from her phone and 5 pictures from her camera, so the total number of pictures is:
31 + 5 = 36 pictures

Step 2: Determine the number of albums Robin sorted the pictures into.
Robin sorted the pictures into 9 different albums.

Step 3: Find the number of pictures in each album.
Since Robin put the same number of pictures in each album, we can divide the total number of pictures (36) by the number of albums (9) to find the number of pictures in each album:
36 ÷ 9 = 4

Step 4: Check the result.
To make sure our answer makes sense, let's think about it. If Robin put 4 pictures in each album, and she sorted the pictures into 9 albums, she would have used up all 36 pictures. This seems reasonable, so our answer appears to be correct.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Isabel baked 3 brownies, but needed 5 total for her party. This means she is short 2 brownies (5 - 3 = 2).

Step 2: Since she needs 2 more brownies, she needs to make 2 more batches of brownies using the same recipe. If she uses 1 cup of flour for each brownie, she will need:

* 2 batches x 1 cup/batch = 2 cups of flour

Step 3: So far, Isabel has used 5 cups of flour for the 3 brownies she has already baked. To make the remaining 2 brownies, she will need an additional 2 cups of flour.

Step 4: To find out how much flour she still needs, we subtract the total flour used so far (5 cups) from the total flour needed (7 cups, including the additional 2 cups needed for the remaining brownies):

* 7 cups - 5 cups = 2 cups

Step 3: To find out how many tickets he has left, we subtract the number of tickets he spent from the total number of tickets he bought:

40 (total tickets) - 28 (tickets spent) = 12

Step 4: Since each ride costs 4 tickets, we need to divide the number of tickets Tom has left by 4 to find out how many rides he can go on:

12 (tickets left) ÷ 4 (tickets per ride) = 3

Step 5: Therefore, Tom can go on 3 rides.

Adam answered 8 questions correctly in the first half and 2 questions correctly in the second half. To find the total number of questions answered, we add these two numbers together:

8 (questions correct in first half) + 2 (questions correct in second half) = 10

{Step 1: Adam answered 10 questions in total.}

Step 2: Determine the points earned for each correct answer.

Each question is worth 8 points. Since Adam answered 8 questions correctly in the first half, he earned:

8 (questions correct in first half) x 8 (points per question) = 64 points

And since Adam answered 2 questions correctly in the second half, he earned:

2 (questions correct in second half) x 8 (points per question) = 16 points

{Step 2: Adam earned 64 points in the first half and 16 points in the second half.}

Step 3: Calculate the total points earned.

To find the total points earned, we add the points earned in the first half and the points earned in the second half:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Bianca and her friends are recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycle, they earn 1 point. We need to find out how many points they earned.

Step 2: Identify the information given
We know that Bianca recycled 24 pounds and her friends recycled 3 pounds.

Step 3: Calculate the points earned by Bianca
For every 3 pounds, Bianca earns 1 point. To find out how many points Bianca earned, we need to divide her total recycled pounds by 3.

24 pounds (recycled by Bianca) ÷ 3 = 8 points

So, Bianca earned 8 points.

Step 4: Calculate the points earned by her friends
For every 3 pounds, her friends earn 1 point. To find out how many points her friends earned, we need to divide their total recycled pounds by 3.

3 pounds (recycled by her friends) ÷ 3 = 1 point

So, her friends earned 1 point.

Step 5: Add the points earned by Bianca and her friends
To find the total points earned, we add the points earned by Bianca and her friends.

8 points (earned by Bianca) + 1 point (earned by her friends) = 9 points

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of friends in the group.
The problem states ""3 friends"", so there are 3 friends in the group.

Step 2: Identify the number of chicken wings cooked by the chef.
The problem states ""8 chicken wings cooked, but cooked 10 more for the group"".
This means the chef started with 8 chicken wings and cooked 10 more, so the total number of chicken wings is 8 + 10 = 18.

Step 3: Determine how many chicken wings each friend will get.
Since there are 3 friends and a total of 18 chicken wings, we need to divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends.

18 chicken wings ÷ 3 friends =?

To solve this, we can divide 18 by 3:

18 ÷ 3 = 6

Step 4: Write the final answer.
{The final answer is} each person will get 6 chicken wings.<|eot_id|>",6

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: John initially has 33 socks.

Step 2: He throws away 19 old socks that didn't fit. To find the number of socks he has left, we subtract 19 from 33:

33 - 19 = 14

So, John has 14 socks left.

Step 3: He buys 13 new socks. To find the total number of socks he now has, we add the 14 socks he had left to the 13 new socks:

14 + 13 = 27

Therefore, John now has 27 socks.

{The final answer is 27 socks.}<|eot_id|>",27

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of new players and returning players.

* There are 2 new players.
* There are 6 returning players.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of players.

* Total number of players = 2 new players + 6 returning players = 8 players

Step 3: Determine the number of groups with 4 players each.

* Since there are 8 players, we can divide this number by 4 to find the number of groups.

* 8 players ÷ 4 players per group = 2 groups

Step 4: Check if there are any remaining players.

* Since 8 players can be divided evenly by 4, there are no remaining players.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of rooms the painter needs to paint.
The problem states that the painter needs to paint 6 rooms in a building.

Step 2: Determine the number of rooms that have already been painted.
The problem states that the painter has already painted 2 rooms.

Step 3: Determine the number of rooms that still need to be painted.
To find this, subtract the number of rooms already painted (2) from the total number of rooms (6):

6 (total rooms) - 2 (rooms already painted) = 4

So, 4 rooms still need to be painted.

Step 4: Determine the time it takes to paint each room.
The problem states that each room takes 5 hours to paint.

Step 5: Determine the total time it takes to paint the remaining rooms.
Since there are 4 rooms left to paint, and each room takes 5 hours to paint, multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to paint each room:

4 (rooms) x 5 (hours per room) = 20 hours

Step 6: Determine how much longer it will take to paint the remaining rooms.
The painter has already spent time painting the 2 rooms that were done earlier. To find out how much longer it will take to paint the remaining rooms, subtract the time spent on the already-painted rooms from the total time it will take to paint all the remaining rooms.

Step 7: Calculate the time spent on the already-painted rooms.
The problem doesn't provide this information, but we can assume it's some amount of time. Let's call it ""x"" hours.

Step 8: Calculate the total time it will take to paint the remaining rooms, including the time spent on the already-painted rooms.
Add the time spent on the already-painted rooms to the total time it will take to paint the remaining rooms:

20 hours (remaining rooms) + x hours (already-painted rooms) =?

Step 9: Determine the final answer.
The problem asks how much longer it will take to paint the remaining rooms. To find this, subtract the time spent on the already-painted rooms from the total time it will take to paint the remaining rooms. Since we don't know the exact time spent on the already-painted rooms, we can't provide a specific answer. However, we can say that it will take at least 20 hours to paint the remaining rooms, and possibly more depending on the time spent on the already-painted rooms.

{The final answer is: It will take at least 20 hours to paint the remaining rooms, and possibly more depending on the time spent on the already-painted rooms.}<|eot_id|>",20

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of customers in the waiter's section.
The problem states that the waiter had 22 customers in his section.

Step 2: Determine how many customers left.
The problem states that 14 of the customers left.

Step 3: Calculate the number of customers remaining.
To do this, we subtract the number of customers who left (14) from the initial number of customers (22).

22 - 14 = 8

So, there are 8 customers remaining.

Step 4: The problem states that the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table.
This means that the remaining 8 customers are sitting at tables with 4 people at each table.

Step 5: Calculate the number of tables.
To do this, we divide the number of remaining customers (8) by the number of people at each table (4).

8 ÷ 4 = 2

So, the waiter had 2 tables with 4 people at each table.

                    , For a birthday party : Cody. bought 4 : regular, sodas ; and 44, diet sodas. If! his fridge would only? hold 6? on each, shelf, ; how many, shelves, would : he? fill up?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of regular sodas and diet sodas Cody bought.
Cody bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of sodas Cody bought.
Total number of sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
= 4 + 44
= 48

Step 3: Determine the maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.
The fridge can hold 6 sodas on each shelf.

Step 4: Calculate the number of shelves needed to hold all the sodas.
To do this, we need to divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.
Number of shelves = Total number of sodas ÷ Sodas per shelf
= 48 ÷ 6
= 8

Step 5: Check if there are any remaining sodas.
Since Cody bought 48 sodas and the fridge can hold 6 sodas on each shelf, there will be 2 sodas left over (48 - 6 x 8 = 2).

However, this is not a problem, as we are asked to find the number of shelves needed to hold all the sodas, and we have already calculated that to be 8 shelves.

{The final answer is 8 shelves}.<|eot_id|>",8

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of students in the debate team.
The problem states that there are 26 boys and 46 girls, so we can add these numbers together to get the total number of students:

26 (boys) + 46 (girls) = 72

{So, there are 72 students in the debate team.}

Step 2: Determine the size of the groups.
The problem states that the students are to be split into groups of 9.

{So, the groups will have 9 students each.}

Step 3: Calculate the number of groups.
To find the number of groups, we can divide the total number of students (72) by the size of each group (9):

72 (total students) ÷ 9 (group size) = 8

{So, the debate team can be split into 8 groups of 9 students each.}

The final answer is:
{The final answer is 8 groups.}<|eot_id|>",8

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of apples ordered
The school cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples. To find the total number of apples, we add these two numbers together:

6 (red apples) + 15 (green apples) = 21 apples

Step 2: Identify the number of students who wanted fruit
According to the problem, only 5 students wanted fruit.

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples needed for the students
Since each student wants fruit, we assume each student wants one piece of fruit. To find the total number of apples needed for the students, we multiply the number of students by 1:

5 students x 1 apple/student = 5 apples

Step 4: Calculate the number of extra apples
The cafeteria ordered a total of 21 apples, but only 5 apples are needed for the students. To find the number of extra apples, we subtract the number of apples needed from the total number of apples:

21 apples (total) - 5 apples (needed) = 16 apples

Step 5: State the answer
{The final answer is} 16 apples. The cafeteria ended up with 16 extra apples.<|eot_id|>",16

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of people at the company picnic.
We are told that there are 9 managers and 15 employees, so we can add these numbers together to get the total number of people:
9 (managers) + 15 (employees) = 24

Step 2: Identify the number of teams.
We are told that the 24 people will be split into 8 teams.

Step 3: Calculate the number of people on each team.
To do this, we can divide the total number of people (24) by the number of teams (8):

24 ÷ 8 = 3

So, each team would have 3 people.

Step 2: They sold 3 books, which means they removed 3 books from the bin.

Step 3: To find the number of books remaining in the bin after the sale, subtract the number of books sold (3) from the initial number of books (4):

4 - 3 = 1

So, there is 1 book remaining in the bin after the sale.

Step 4: The store then put 10 more books in the bin.

Step 5: To find the total number of books in the bin, add the remaining book from Step 3 (1) to the 10 new books:

Mike made 42 dollars mowing lawns over the summer.

Step 2: Determine how much money Mike spent on new mower blades.
He spent 10 dollars buying new mower blades.

Step 3: Calculate how much money Mike had left after buying the mower blades.
To do this, subtract the amount spent on mower blades from the initial amount made:
42 (initial amount) - 10 (amount spent) = 32 dollars

Step 4: Determine how many 8-dollar games Mike could buy with the money he had left.
To do this, divide the amount of money Mike had left (32 dollars) by the cost of each game (8 dollars):
32 ÷ 8 = 4

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of potatoes that need to be cooked.
The chef needs to cook 13 potatoes, but he has already cooked 5. This means he needs to cook 13 - 5 = 8 potatoes.

Step 2: Determine the time it takes to cook one potato.
Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to cook the remaining potatoes.
Since the chef needs to cook 8 potatoes, and each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, we can multiply the number of potatoes by the time it takes to cook one potato:

8 potatoes x 6 minutes/potato = 48 minutes

Step 4: Determine the total time it will take to cook the remaining potatoes.
The chef already cooked 5 potatoes, which took 5 x 6 = 30 minutes. To cook the remaining 8 potatoes, it will take an additional 48 minutes.

Step 5: Add the time it took to cook the initial 5 potatoes to the time it will take to cook the remaining potatoes.
30 minutes (initial 5 potatoes) + 48 minutes (remaining 8 potatoes) = 78 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of problems Paige has to do for homework.
She has 43 math problems and 12 science problems, which means she has a total of:

43 (math problems) + 12 (science problems) = 55 problems

Step 2: Identify the number of problems Paige finished at school.
She finished 44% of the problems, which means she finished:

44% of 55 problems = 0.44 x 55 = 24.2 problems

Since you can't finish a fraction of a problem, we'll round this down to the nearest whole number, which is:

24 problems

Step 3: Calculate the number of problems Paige has left to do for homework.
To do this, we subtract the number of problems she finished at school from the total number of problems she had to do:

55 (total problems) - 24 (problems finished) = 31 problems

Therefore, Paige has 31 problems left to do for homework.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* April's discount flowers is having a sale.
* Each flower is $8.
* Vanessa bought 3 roses and 3 daisies.

Step 2: Determine what type of discount is being offered. Is it a percentage off or a fixed amount off?

* The problem doesn't explicitly state the type of discount, so we'll assume it's a fixed amount off. If it were a percentage off, we'd need more information.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the flowers before the discount.

* 3 roses and 3 daisies is a total of 6 flowers.
* Since each flower is $8, the total cost before the discount is:
6 flowers x $8/flower = $48

Step 4: Apply the discount to the total cost.

* Since the problem doesn't specify the amount of the discount, we'll assume it's a flat discount of $x.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost after the discount.

* The total cost after the discount is:
$48 - $x

Step 6: Determine the amount of the discount.

* Since we don't know the amount of the discount, we can't calculate the final cost. We need more information.

Step 7: Provide an answer.

* Unfortunately, without knowing the amount of the discount, we can't provide a final answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Olivia uploaded a total of 5 pictures from her phone and 35 pictures from her camera to Facebook.

We need to combine these two numbers to get the total number of pictures she uploaded:

5 (phone) + 35 (camera) = 40 pictures

{Step 1: Total number of pictures uploaded}

2. She sorted the pictures into 8 different albums, with the same amount of pictures in each album.

This means that the total number of pictures (40) needs to be divided evenly into 8 albums.

To do this, we can divide 40 by 8:

40 ÷ 8 = 5

{Step 2: Divide total number of pictures by number of albums}

3. Since the same amount of pictures is in each album, we can conclude that each album contains 5 pictures.

She has 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies, so the total number of cookies is:
23 (chocolate chip) + 25 (oatmeal) = 48 cookies

Step 2: Determine the number of cookies in each baggie.
Robin is making baggies with 6 cookies in each bag.

Step 3: Divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in each baggie.
To find out how many baggies Robin can make, we need to divide the total number of cookies (48) by the number of cookies in each baggie (6).

48 cookies ÷ 6 cookies per baggie = 8 baggies

Step 4: Check the result.
Since we can't make a fraction of a baggie, we can conclude that Robin can make 8 full baggies with the cookies she has.

3. So, on the first level, she scores 7 points for each of the 2 treasures, which is:

7 points/treasure × 2 treasures = 14 points

4. She also finds 6 treasures on the second level.

5. On the second level, she scores 7 points for each of the 6 treasures, which is:

7 points/treasure × 6 treasures = 42 points

6. To find her total score, we add the points she scored on both levels:

14 points (first level) + 42 points (second level) = 56 points

{The final answer is 56 points}.<|eot_id|>",56

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Megan initially picks 19 carrots from her garden.

Step 2: She throws out 4 carrots, which means she has 19 - 4 = 15 carrots left.

Step 3: The next day, she picks 46 more carrots.

Step 4: To find the total number of carrots Megan has, we need to add the 15 carrots she had left after throwing out 4, to the 46 new carrots she picked.

Step 5: We can add these numbers using the following calculation:

15 (carrots left after throwing out 4) + 46 (new carrots picked) =?

Step 6: Performing the addition:

15 + 46 = 61

Step 7: Therefore, Megan has a total of 61 carrots.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Wendy had 82 files on her computer. She deleted 37 of them.

To find out how many files she has left, I'll subtract 37 from 82:

82 - 37 = 45

So, Wendy has 45 files left.

Step 2: She put the rest (45 files) into folders with 5 files in each.

To find out how many folders she needs, I'll divide the number of files left (45) by the number of files per folder (5):

45 ÷ 5 = 9

So, Wendy needs 9 folders to store the remaining 45 files.

Step 3: Since each folder can hold 5 files, and she has 45 files, she will need at least 9 folders to accommodate all the files.

Therefore, {The final answer is} Wendy ended up with 9 folders.<|eot_id|>",9

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of players.
There are 12 new players and 44 returning players, so the total number of players is:
12 (new) + 44 (returning) = 56 players

Step 2: Determine the number of players per group.
The coach wants to put the players into groups with 8 players in each group.

Step 3: Divide the total number of players by the number of players per group.
To find the number of groups, we can divide the total number of players (56) by the number of players per group (8):

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Step 4: Check the remainder (if any).
Since we're dividing a whole number (56) by another whole number (8), we don't have a remainder.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Sam is collecting cans for recycling. He collects cans on Saturday and Sunday.

Step 2: Identify the number of bags collected on Saturday
Sam filled 3 bags on Saturday.

Step 3: Identify the number of bags collected on Sunday
Sam filled 4 more bags on Sunday. Since he already filled 3 bags on Saturday, he filled a total of 3 + 4 = 7 bags on Sunday.

Step 4: Identify the number of cans in each bag
Each bag has 9 cans in it.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of cans collected on Saturday
Sam filled 3 bags on Saturday, and each bag has 9 cans. To find the total number of cans, multiply the number of bags by the number of cans in each bag:
3 bags x 9 cans/bag = 27 cans

Step 6: Calculate the total number of cans collected on Sunday
Sam filled 4 bags on Sunday, and each bag has 9 cans. To find the total number of cans, multiply the number of bags by the number of cans in each bag:
4 bags x 9 cans/bag = 36 cans

Step 7: Calculate the total number of cans collected

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The worksheet has 4? problems on it. This means that each worksheet has 4 unknown problems (denoted by the question mark?).

2. The teacher has 16 worksheets to grade. This means that she needs to grade 16 worksheets in total.

3. She has already graded 8 of them. This means that she has completed grading 8 worksheets.

4. To find out how many more problems she has to grade, we need to calculate the total number of problems she still needs to grade.

5. Since each worksheet has 4 problems, the total number of problems in 16 worksheets is:
16 worksheets x 4 problems per worksheet = 64 problems

6. She has already graded 8 worksheets, which means she has graded 8 x 4 = 32 problems.

7. To find the number of problems she still needs to grade, we subtract the number of problems she has already graded from the total number of problems:
64 problems - 32 problems = 32 problems

8. Since each worksheet has 4 problems, the number of worksheets she still needs to grade is:
32 problems ÷ 4 problems per worksheet = 8 worksheets

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of boxes Paige found.
The problem states that Paige found ""6 boxes of clothing.""

Step 2: Determine the number of scarves in each box.
The problem states that inside each box, there are ""5 scarves.""

Step 3: Determine the number of mittens in each box.
The problem states that inside each box, there are ""5 mittens.""

Step 4: Calculate the total number of scarves Paige found.
Since there are 6 boxes, and each box has 5 scarves, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves per box:

6 boxes × 5 scarves per box = 30 scarves

Step 5: Calculate the total number of mittens Paige found.
Using the same logic as Step 4, we can calculate the total number of mittens:

6 boxes × 5 mittens per box = 30 mittens

Step 6: Calculate the total number of pieces of winter clothing Paige found.
We need to add the total number of scarves and mittens to find the total number of pieces of winter clothing:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of potatoes that need to be cooked.
The chef needs to cook 12 potatoes, but he has already cooked 6. So, the number of potatoes that still need to be cooked is:
12 (total potatoes) - 6 (already cooked) = 6 potatoes

Step 2: Determine the total cooking time for the already cooked potatoes.
The chef has already cooked 6 potatoes, and each potato takes 6 minutes to cook. So, the total cooking time for the already cooked potatoes is:
6 potatoes x 6 minutes/potato = 36 minutes

Step 3: Determine the total cooking time for the remaining potatoes.
The chef still needs to cook 6 potatoes, and each potato takes 6 minutes to cook. So, the total cooking time for the remaining potatoes is:
6 potatoes x 6 minutes/potato = 36 minutes

Step 4: Add the cooking times for the already cooked and remaining potatoes.
The chef has already cooked 36 minutes worth of potatoes, and he still needs to cook 36 minutes worth of potatoes. So, the total cooking time for all the potatoes is:
36 minutes (already cooked) + 36 minutes (remaining potatoes) = 72 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Luke started with 57 games and sold 39 of them. We need to find out how many boxes he needs to use.

Step 2: Calculate the number of games Luke has left after selling 39.
Luke started with 57 games and sold 39. To find out how many games he has left, we need to subtract 39 from 57.

57 - 39 = 18

So, Luke has 18 games left.

Step 3: Determine how many games Luke can put in each box.
The problem states that Luke puts 2 games into each box. We need to find out how many boxes he can fill with the 18 games he has left.

Step 4: Calculate the number of boxes Luke can fill.
To find out how many boxes Luke can fill, we need to divide the number of games he has left (18) by the number of games he can put in each box (2).

18 ÷ 2 = 9

So, Luke can fill 9 boxes with the 18 games he has left.

Step 5: Check if there are any leftover games.
Since Luke can fill 9 boxes with the 18 games he has left, we need to check if there are any leftover games.

18 (games left) - 18 (games in boxes) = 0

There are no leftover games, which means Luke has used up all the games he had left.

Step 1: Identify the sale information
The sale is described as ""each flower was $3"". This means that the cost of one flower is $3.

Step 2: Identify the items Emily bought
Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies. We don't know the cost of each individual item, but we know the cost of each flower is $3.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the roses
Emily bought 2 roses, and each rose costs $3. To find the total cost of the roses, we multiply the number of roses by the cost of one rose:

2 roses x $3/rose = $6

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the daisies
Emily bought 2 daisies, and each daisy costs $3. To find the total cost of the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the cost of one daisy:

2 daisies x $3/daisy = $6

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of all the flowers
Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies, and each flower costs $3. To find the total cost of all the flowers, we add the cost of the roses and the cost of the daisies:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Isabel picked 66 flowers for her friend's wedding. She was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. However, 10 of the flowers wilted before the wedding.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of flowers available
Isabel had 66 flowers initially. However, 10 of them wilted, so we subtract 10 from 66 to get the total number of flowers available:

66 - 10 = 56

Step 3: Calculate the number of bouquets Isabel can make
Isabel wants to make bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. To find out how many bouquets she can make, we divide the total number of flowers available (56) by 8:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Step 4: Check if Isabel can make more bouquets
Since Isabel can make 7 bouquets with 8 flowers in each one, we need to check if she has enough flowers to make more bouquets. Since she has 56 flowers and she's using 8 flowers per bouquet, she can make at most 7 bouquets.

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
- Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times.
- He rode the bumper cars 4 times.
- Each ride costs 7 tickets.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tickets used for the ferris wheel rides.
- Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times, and each ride costs 7 tickets.
- To find the total number of tickets used, multiply the number of times he rode the ferris wheel (5) by the number of tickets per ride (7).
5 x 7 = 35

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tickets used for the bumper cars.
- Oliver rode the bumper cars 4 times, and each ride costs 7 tickets.
- To find the total number of tickets used, multiply the number of times he rode the bumper cars (4) by the number of tickets per ride (7).
4 x 7 = 28

Step 4: Add the total number of tickets used for the ferris wheel rides and the bumper cars to find the total number of tickets used.
- 35 (ferris wheel) + 28 (bumper cars) = 63

Step 2: Determine the number of cats sold.
During the sale, 45 cats were sold.

Step 3: Subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of cats.
To find the number of cats left, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of cats:

63 (initial cats) - 45 (cats sold) =?

How : many. points? did! she ; have? at? the : end of! the ; game?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Determine the total points Carol scored in the first two rounds.
To do this, I'll add the points she scored in each round:
17 points (from the first round) + 6 points (from the second round) = 23 points

Step 2: Subtract the points she lost in the last round from the total points she scored in the first two rounds.
To do this, I'll subtract 16 points from 23 points:
23 points - 16 points = 7 points

Step 3: Determine the final number of points Carol has at the end of the game.
Since she lost 16 points in the last round, I'll subtract those points from the total points she scored in the first two rounds (which is 23 points). This gives me the final number of points:
23 points - 16 points = 7 points

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy.

Step 2: Identify the action taken
Dave gave 5 boxes to his little brother.

Step 3: Calculate the number of boxes Dave has left
Dave had 12 boxes initially, and he gave 5 away. To find the number of boxes he has left, we subtract 5 from 12:

12 - 5 = 7

So, Dave has 7 boxes left.

Step 4: Identify the number of pieces in each box
Each box has 3 pieces inside it.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of pieces in the boxes Dave has left
Since Dave has 7 boxes left, and each box has 3 pieces, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces in each box:

7 boxes x 3 pieces per box = 21 pieces

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
A waiter at ""The Greasy Spoon"" restaurant had 39 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush, he added 12 more customers.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of customers
The waiter initially had 39 customers. He added 12 more, so the total number of customers is:
39 + 12 = 51

Step 3: Determine how many customers didn't leave a tip
49% of the customers didn't leave a tip. To find the number of customers who didn't leave a tip, multiply the total number of customers by the percentage:
51 x 0.49 = 24.99 (round down to 24, since you can't have a fraction of a customer)

Step 4: Find the number of customers who left a tip
The total number of customers is 51. The number of customers who didn't leave a tip is 24. To find the number of customers who left a tip, subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total:
51 - 24 = 27

The cafeteria had 50 apples.

Step 2: Identify the number of apples given to students
They handed out 5 apples to students.

Step 3: Subtract the number of apples given to students from the initial number of apples
50 apples (initial) - 5 apples (given to students) = 45 apples remaining

Step 4: Determine how many pies can be made using the remaining apples
Each pie takes 5 apples. To find out how many pies can be made, we need to divide the remaining apples by 5.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Oliver had 33 dollars in January. This is the initial amount of money he had.

Step 2: By March, he had spent 4 dollars. To find out how much money he had left, we need to subtract the amount spent from the initial amount:

33 - 4 = 29

So, Oliver had 29 dollars left after spending 4 dollars.

Step 3: If he got another 32 dollars from his mom, we need to add this amount to the amount he had left:

29 + 32 = 61

So, Oliver now has a total of 61 dollars.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The school cafeteria had 14 apples initially.
2. They used 13 apples to make lunch for the students. To find out how many apples they used, we subtract 13 from the initial number of apples:

14 - 13 = 1

So, they used 1 apple less than the initial number of apples.

3. After using 13 apples, they bought 49 more apples. To find out how many apples they have now, we add the number of apples they bought to the number of apples they had left after using some:

Initial number of apples = 14
Apples used = 13
Apples left = 14 - 13 = 1
Apples bought = 49
Total apples now = Apples left + Apples bought = 1 + 49 = 50
