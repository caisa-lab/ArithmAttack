                    question:
                     Paige! had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how ; many songs? does she have on her mp3 player?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Paige initially had 11 songs on her mp3 player.

Step 2: She deleted 9 old songs from it. To find the number of songs she has left, we subtract the number of songs deleted (9) from the initial number of songs (11):

11 - 9 = 2

So, Paige has 2 songs left on her mp3 player after deleting 9 old songs.

Step 3: She then added 8 new songs to her mp3 player. To find the total number of songs she has now, we add the number of new songs (8) to the number of songs she had left (2):

2 + 8 = 10

Step 4: Therefore, Paige has 10 songs on her mp3 player after deleting 9 old songs and adding 8 new songs.

{The final answer is 10 songs.}<|eot_id|>",10,10.0,10.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of students trying out for the school's basketball team.
There were 39 girls and 4 boys, so the total number of students trying out is:
39 (girls) + 4 (boys) = 43 students

Step 2: Identify the number of students who got called back.
Only 26 students got called back, so the number of students who didn't make the cut is:
43 (total students) - 26 (students who got called back) = 17 students

{The final answer is 17 students didn't make the cut.}<|eot_id|>",17,17.0,17.0
" Faye had 34 coloring books. ; If she gave away 3 of them, but then bought 48 more, , how many would she have total? ","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Faye had 34 coloring books initially.

Step 2: She gave away 3 coloring books. To find out how many she has left, we subtract 3 from 34:

34 - 3 = 31

So, Faye has 31 coloring books left.

Step 3: Then, she bought 48 more coloring books. To find out how many she has now, we add 48 to the 31 she had left:

31 + 48 = 79

Step 4: Finally, we add the original 34 coloring books she had to the 79 she has now:

79 + 34 = 113

{The final answer is 113 coloring books.}<|eot_id|>",79,79.0,113.0

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: The school cafeteria initially has 23 apples.

Step 2: They use 20 apples to make lunch for the students. To find the number of apples left, I'll subtract 20 from 23:

23 - 20 = 3

So, after using 20 apples, the school cafeteria has 3 apples left.

Step 3: Then, they buy 6 more apples. To find the total number of apples they have now, I'll add 6 to the 3 apples they had left:

3 + 6 = 9

Step 4: Therefore, the school cafeteria now has a total of 9 apples.

{The final answer is 9 apples.}<|eot_id|>",9,9.0,9.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* April started with 13 roses.
* She had 4 roses left after the sale.

Step 2: Determine the number of roses April sold.

* Since she started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left, she must have sold:
13 (initial roses) - 4 (roses left) = 9 roses

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money April earned from selling the roses.

* Each rose was $4, and she sold 9 roses.
* To find the total amount of money earned, multiply the number of roses sold by the price of each rose:
9 (roses sold) x $4 (price per rose) = $36

Step 4: Verify the answer.

* We can double-check our answer by ensuring that the total amount of money earned is consistent with the information given. Since April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left, she must have earned some amount of money. The answer of $36 seems reasonable, given that she sold 9 roses at $4 each.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of people who actually showed up for the luncheon.
The problem states that 7 people didn't show up, so we need to subtract 7 from the total number of people invited (47).

47 (total invited) - 7 (didn't show up) = 40

So, 40 people actually showed up for the luncheon.

Step 2: Determine the number of tables needed.
The tables can hold 5 people each, so we need to divide the number of people who showed up (40) by the number of people each table can hold (5).

40 (people who showed up) Ã· 5 (people per table) = 8

Step 3: Determine the number of tables needed.
Since we need to accommodate 40 people, and each table can hold 5 people, we need 8 tables to accommodate all the people who showed up.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Tom starts with 5 books.

Step 2: He sells 4 of them. This means he is left with:

5 (initial books) - 4 (books sold) = 1 book

Tom is left with 1 book.

Step 3: Tom uses the money he earned from selling the 4 books to buy new books. Let's assume the money earned is sufficient to buy the new books.

Step 4: Tom buys 38 new books. This means he adds these new books to the 1 book he had left after selling the initial 4 books.

1 (book left after selling) + 38 (new books bought) = 39 books

Step 5: Therefore, Tom now has a total of 39 books.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sodas Jerry bought.
Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. To find the total, we add these numbers together:

41 + 22 = 63

So, Jerry bought a total of 63 sodas.

Step 2: Determine how many sodas can fit on each shelf.
Jerry's fridge can hold 9 sodas on each shelf.

Step 3: Divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.
To find out how many shelves Jerry needs to fill up, we divide the total number of sodas (63) by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf (9):

63 Ã· 9 = 7

So, Jerry needs 7 shelves to fill up.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the total number of pieces of candy Debby and her sister had initially.

Debby had 32 pieces of candy, and her sister had 42 pieces of candy. To find the total, we add these two numbers together:

32 + 42 = 74

So, Debby and her sister had a total of 74 pieces of candy initially.

Step 2: Find the number of pieces of candy they ate on the first night.

They ate 35 pieces of candy on the first night.

Step 3: Find the total number of pieces of candy left after the first night.

To do this, we subtract the number of pieces eaten (35) from the total number of pieces they had initially (74):

74 - 35 = 39

So, Debby and her sister have 39 pieces of candy left after the first night.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Emily started with 41 seeds.
Step 2: She planted 29 seeds in the big garden. This leaves 41 - 29 = 12 seeds remaining.

Step 3: Emily planted 4 seeds in each of her small gardens. Since she planted 12 seeds, she must have planted 12/4 = 3 times in her small gardens.

Step 4: Since Emily planted 4 seeds in each small garden, she must have had 3 small gardens to accommodate the remaining 12 seeds.

Step 5: Emily also mentioned that she planted seeds in each of her small gardens, implying that she had at least one small garden. Therefore, the minimum number of small gardens she had is 1.

Step 6: Since Emily planted 4 seeds in each small garden, she must have had more than one small garden to accommodate the remaining 12 seeds. Therefore, the number of small gardens she had is greater than 1.

Step 7: Combining the information from Steps 4 and 6, we can conclude that Emily had at least 2 small gardens.

Step 8: To find the exact number of small gardens, we can subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden (29) from the total number of seeds Emily started with (41). This leaves 41 - 29 = 12 seeds remaining. Since Emily planted 4 seeds in each small garden, she must have had 12/4 = 3 small gardens.

{The final answer is 3 small gardens.}<|eot_id|>",3,3.0,3.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of pieces of candy Emily received.

Emily received 5 pieces from her neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister, so the total number of pieces she received is:

5 (pieces from neighbors) + 13 (pieces from older sister) = 18 pieces

Step 2: Determine how many pieces of candy Emily ate per day.

Emily ate 9 pieces of candy per day.

Step 3: Divide the total number of pieces of candy by the number of pieces Emily eats per day to find out how many days the candy will last.

To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces (18) by the number of pieces Emily eats per day (9):

18 pieces Ã· 9 pieces/day = 2 days

Step 4: Check the answer to make sure it makes sense.

It seems reasonable that if Emily eats 9 pieces of candy per day, the candy would last her for 2 days, since she received a total of 18 pieces.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of customers who didn't leave a tip.
The problem states that 5 out of 7 customers didn't leave a tip.

Step 2: Identify the number of customers who did leave a tip.
Since 5 customers didn't leave a tip, the remaining 2 customers (7 - 5 = 2) must have left a tip.

Step 3: Determine how much money the waiter earned from the customers who left a tip.
The problem states that the waiter got $3 each from the customers who did leave a tip. Since there are 2 customers who left a tip, the waiter earned a total of:

2 customers x $3 each = $6

Step 4: Determine the total amount of money the waiter earned.
The waiter earned $6 from the customers who left a tip, but didn't earn anything from the customers who didn't leave a tip. Therefore, the total amount of money the waiter earned is:

$6

                     A group of 4 ; friends went into a restaurant. The chef already had 9 chicken wings cooked but cooked. 7 more? for the group. If they each got the same amount how many would each person get?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of chicken wings available for the group.
The chef had 9 chicken wings cooked initially, and then cooked 7 more. To find the total number of chicken wings, we add the initial 9 to the additional 7:

9 + 7 = 16

Step 2: Determine how many chicken wings each person will receive.
There are 4 friends in the group, and they each receive the same amount. To find the number of chicken wings each person will receive, we divide the total number of chicken wings (16) by the number of people (4):

16 Ã· 4 = 4

Step 3: Verify the answer.
To ensure each person gets the same amount, we can multiply the number of people (4) by the number of chicken wings each person receives (4):

4 x 4 = 16

This checks out, as we started with 16 chicken wings and each person receives 4, which adds up to the total number of chicken wings.

John earned $8 for each lawn he mowed. If he had 15 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 7 of them, how much money did he actually earn?

Step 2: Understand the problem
John had 15 lawns to mow, but he forgot to mow 7 of them. This means he only mowed 15 - 7 = 8 lawns.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount earned
John earned $8 for each lawn he mowed, and he mowed 8 lawns. To find the total amount earned, multiply the number of lawns mowed by the amount earned per lawn:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of puppies at the shelter.
The problem states that the shelter had 5 puppies initially.

Step 2: Add the new puppies brought in.
The problem states that 35 more puppies were brought in, so we add this to the initial number:
5 (initial puppies) + 35 (new puppies) = 40 puppies

Step 3: Identify the number of puppies adopted each day.
The problem states that 8 puppies are adopted each day.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of puppies that need to be adopted to adopt all puppies.
We need to adopt all 40 puppies, so we subtract the initial 5 puppies from the total:
40 (total puppies) - 5 (initial puppies) = 35 puppies

Step 5: Calculate the number of days it takes to adopt all puppies.
We need to adopt 35 puppies, and 8 puppies are adopted each day. To find the number of days, we divide the number of puppies to be adopted by the number adopted each day:
35 puppies Ã· 8 puppies/day = 4.375 days

Step 6: Round the answer to the nearest whole number.
Since we can't adopt a fraction of a puppy, we round the answer to the nearest whole number:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The building needs 9 windows.
* The builder has already installed 6 windows.

Step 2: Calculate the number of windows left to be installed

* To find the number of windows left to be installed, subtract the number of windows already installed (6) from the total number of windows needed (9).

9 (total windows) - 6 (already installed) = 3

So, there are 3 windows left to be installed.

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to install one window

* According to the problem, it takes 6 hours to install each window.

Step 4: Calculate the time it will take to install the remaining windows

* Since it takes 6 hours to install one window, we need to multiply the number of windows left to be installed (3) by the time it takes to install one window (6 hours).

3 (windows left) Ã— 6 (hours per window) = 18 hours

So, it will take 18 hours to install the remaining 3 windows.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of bears in stock
The toy store had 17 giant stuffed bears in stock initially.

Step 2: Identify the number of bears added to the stock
A shipment of 10 bears was received, which was added to the existing stock.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of bears in stock
The total number of bears in stock is the initial number plus the number of bears added: 17 (initial) + 10 (added) = 27 bears

Step 4: Determine the number of bears per shelf
The bears are placed on shelves with 9 bears on each shelf.

Step 5: Calculate the number of shelves needed
To find the number of shelves needed, we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf: 27 bears Ã· 9 bears per shelf = 3 shelves

Step 6: Check if there are any remaining bears
Since we've calculated the number of shelves needed, let's check if there are any remaining bears. If there are, we'll need to add more shelves. However, in this case, there are no remaining bears, so we can conclude that 3 shelves are needed.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Gwen has 5 shelves of mystery books and 3 shelves of picture books.
We also know that each shelf has exactly 4 books on it.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of books on the mystery book shelves.
Since each shelf has 4 books, and there are 5 shelves, we can multiply the number of shelves by the number of books on each shelf:
5 shelves x 4 books/shelf = 20 books

Step 3: Calculate the total number of books on the picture book shelves.
Since each shelf has 4 books, and there are 3 shelves, we can multiply the number of shelves by the number of books on each shelf:
3 shelves x 4 books/shelf = 12 books

Step 4: Add the total number of books on the mystery book shelves and the picture book shelves to find the total number of books Gwen has.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Wendy uploaded 79 pictures to Facebook. We know that she put 44 pictures into one album.

Step 2: We need to find out how many pictures are left after putting 44 pictures into one album. To do this, we subtract 44 from 79:

79 - 44 = 35

So, 35 pictures are left after putting 44 pictures into one album.

Step 3: We know that Wendy put the remaining 35 pictures into 5 different albums. To distribute the 35 pictures evenly among the 5 albums, we divide 35 by 5:

35 Ã· 5 = 7

This means that each album will have 7 pictures, except for the first album that has 44 pictures.

Step 4: Since the first album has 44 pictures, we subtract 7 from 44 to find out how many pictures are left in the first album:

44 - 7 = 37

This means that the first album has 37 pictures, and the remaining 4 albums will have 7 pictures each.

Step 5: The final answer is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of students on the debate team.
The problem states that there are 0.5 boys and 40 girls, but it doesn't specify the number of students. Since 0.5 is a fraction, we can assume that it's a part of the total number of boys. Let's convert it to a whole number. Since 0.5 is half of 1, we can add 1 to the total number of boys. So, the total number of boys is 1 + 1 = 2.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of students.
The total number of boys is 2, and the total number of girls is 40. To find the total number of students, we add the number of boys and girls:
Total number of students = 2 (boys) + 40 (girls) = 42

Step 3: Identify the group size.
The problem states that the students will be split into groups of 9.

Step 4: Calculate the number of groups.
To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the group size:
Number of groups = Total number of students Ã· Group size
= 42 Ã· 9
= 4.67 (round down to 4, since you can't have a fraction of a group)

So, April sold 5 roses.

Step 2: Determine the revenue from the sale of each rose.

Each rose was sold for $7, so the revenue from the sale of each rose is $7.

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from the sale of the 5 roses.

We multiply the number of roses sold (5) by the revenue from the sale of each rose ($7):

5 (roses sold) Ã— $7 (revenue per rose) = $35

So, the total revenue from the sale of the 5 roses is $35.

Step 4: Determine the final answer.

To find the number of members who did show up, subtract the number of members who didn't show up from the initial number of team members:
11 (initial members) - 6 (members who didn't show up) = 5

Step 4: Determine the number of points scored by each member who showed up.
Each member who showed up scored 9 points.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of points scored by the members who showed up.
Since there were 5 members who showed up, and each scored 9 points, multiply the number of members by the points scored per member:
5 (members) x 9 (points per member) = 45

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of cupcakes Megan has left after Todd eats 43.

Megan started with 71 cupcakes and Todd ate 43. To find the number of cupcakes Megan has left, we subtract 43 from 71:

71 - 43 = 28

So, Megan has 28 cupcakes left.

Step 2: Determine how many packages Megan can make with the remaining cupcakes.

Each package contains 7 cupcakes. To find the number of packages Megan can make, we divide the number of cupcakes she has left (28) by 7:

28 Ã· 7 = 4

So, Megan can make 4 packages with the remaining cupcakes.

Step 3: Determine how many packages Megan could have made if she had put all 71 cupcakes in packages.

If Megan had put all 71 cupcakes in packages, she would have:

71 Ã· 7 = 10

So, Megan could have made 10 packages if she had put all 71 cupcakes in packages.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Sam starts with 10 socks.

Step 2: He throws away 3 old socks that didn't fit. To find the number of socks he has left, we subtract 3 from 10:

10 - 3 = 7

So, Sam has 7 socks left.

Step 3: Sam buys 36 new socks. To find the total number of socks he has now, we add 36 to the 7 socks he had left:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Each van can hold 5 people.
* There are 12 students going on the field trip.
* There are 3 adults going on the field trip.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of people going on the field trip.

* 12 students + 3 adults = 15 people

Step 3: Determine how many vans are needed to transport all 15 people.

* Since each van can hold 5 people, we need to divide the total number of people (15) by the number of people each van can hold (5).

15 Ã· 5 = 3

Step 4: Since we can't have a fraction of a van, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we need at least 3 vans to transport all 15 people.

Step 5: Check our answer by calculating the total number of people that can be transported by 3 vans.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of sodas
Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas, so the total number of sodas is:
4 (regular sodas) + 52 (diet sodas) = 56 sodas

Step 3: Determine the capacity of each shelf
The fridge can hold 7 sodas on each shelf.

Step 4: Calculate the number of shelves needed to hold all the sodas
Since Tom has 56 sodas, we need to find out how many shelves it would take to hold all of them. We can divide the total number of sodas by the capacity of each shelf:

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: The cafeteria starts with 38 apples.

Step 2: They use 20 apples to make lunch for the students. To find the remaining apples, I subtract 20 from 38:

38 - 20 = 18

So, after using 20 apples, they have 18 apples left.

Step 3: Then, they buy 28 more apples. To find the total number of apples they now have, I add the remaining apples (18) to the new apples (28):

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of trays Luke needs to pick up from each table.

* Table 1: 20 trays
* Table 2: 16 trays

Step 2: Calculate the total number of trays Luke needs to pick up.

20 trays (Table 1) + 16 trays (Table 2) = 36 trays

Step 3: Determine how many trays Luke can carry on each trip.

Luke can carry 4 trays at a time.

Step 4: Calculate the number of trips Luke will need to make to pick up all the trays.

To find the number of trips, we need to divide the total number of trays (36) by the number of trays Luke can carry on each trip (4).

36 trays Ã· 4 trays/trip = 9 trips

Step 5: Check the answer.

Luke needs to pick up 36 trays, and he can carry 4 trays at a time. To find the number of trips, we divided 36 by 4 and got 9. This makes sense, as Luke will need to make 9 trips to pick up all 36 trays.

Step 1: Tiffany has 8 brownies, but needs a total of 17. To find out how many more brownies she needs, I'll subtract the number she has from the total number needed:

17 (total needed) - 8 (brownies she has) =?

Step 2: I'll perform the subtraction:

17 - 8 = 9

So, Tiffany needs 9 more brownies.

Step 3: Since each brownie requires 8 cups of flour, I'll multiply the number of brownies she needs by the amount of flour needed per brownie:

9 (brownies needed) x 8 (cups of flour per brownie) =?

Step 4: I'll perform the multiplication:

9 x 8 = 72

So, Tiffany needs 72 cups of flour in total.

Step 5: Since she already used 8 cups of flour for the 8 brownies she baked, I'll subtract the amount she used from the total amount needed:

72 (total flour needed) - 8 (flour used) =?

Step 6: I'll perform the subtraction:

72 - 8 = 64

So, Tiffany still needs 64 cups of flour.

{The final answer is 64 cups of flour.}<|eot_id|>",72,72.0,64.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given
We know that Carol picked 29 carrots and her mother picked 16 carrots. We also know that only 38 carrots were good.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of carrots picked
To find the total number of carrots picked, we add the number of carrots picked by Carol and her mother:

29 (Carol's carrots) + 16 (mother's carrots) = 45

Step 3: Identify the total number of carrots
We know that only 38 carrots were good. To find the total number of carrots, we add the number of good carrots to the number of bad carrots. Since we don't know the number of bad carrots yet, we'll represent it as x.

38 (good carrots) + x (bad carrots) = 45 (total carrots)

Step 4: Solve for x
We can solve for x by subtracting 38 from both sides of the equation:

x = 45 - 38
x = 7

Step 5: State the answer
The number of bad carrots is 7.

{The final answer is 7 bad carrots.}<|eot_id|>",7,7.0,7.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Bianca received 78 pieces of candy. She ate 30 pieces, so let's subtract 30 from 78 to find out how many pieces of candy she has left:

78 - 30 = 48

So, Bianca has 48 pieces of candy left.

Step 2: Bianca wants to place the remaining candy into piles with 8 pieces in each pile. To find out how many piles she can make, we need to divide the number of pieces she has left (48) by 8.

48 Ã· 8 =?

Step 3: To divide 48 by 8, we can start by dividing 48 by 8 to get the quotient (result) and remainder (leftover):

48 Ã· 8 = 6 with a remainder of 0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of shirts Dave had to wash.
Dave had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts. To find the total number of shirts, we add these two numbers together:

9 (short sleeve shirts) + 27 (long sleeve shirts) = 36 shirts

Step 2: Identify the number of shirts Dave washed before school started.
Dave washed 20 shirts by the time school started.

Step 3: Find the number of shirts Dave did not wash.
To find the number of shirts Dave did not wash, we subtract the number of shirts he washed (20) from the total number of shirts he had to wash (36):

36 (total shirts) - 20 (shirts washed) = 16 shirts

{The final answer is 16 shirts.}<|eot_id|>",16,16.0,16.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of potatoes left to be cooked.
The chef has already cooked 7 potatoes, and he needs to cook a total of 9 potatoes. To find the number of potatoes left to be cooked, subtract the number of potatoes already cooked from the total number of potatoes:

9 (total potatoes) - 7 (already cooked) = 2

{Step 1: 2 potatoes left to be cooked}

Step 2: Determine the time it takes to cook each potato.
Each potato takes 3 minutes to cook. Since we're dealing with the time it takes to cook the remaining potatoes, we'll use this information to calculate the total time.

{Step 2: Each potato takes 3 minutes to cook}

Step 3: Calculate the total time to cook the remaining potatoes.
Since there are 2 potatoes left to be cooked, multiply the number of potatoes by the time it takes to cook each potato:

2 (potatoes) x 3 (minutes per potato) = 6 minutes

{Step 3: It will take 6 minutes to cook the remaining 2 potatoes}

The final answer is:

59 (initial pieces) - 32 (pieces in first load) = 27 pieces left

Step 2: Determine the total number of pieces to be split into 9 equal loads.

There are 27 pieces left, and Will wants to split them into 9 equal loads. To find the number of pieces in each load, we can divide the total number of pieces left (27) by the number of loads (9):

27 (pieces left) Ã· 9 (loads) =?

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks how many books Adam would have after selling some of his books and using the money to buy new ones.

Step 2: Identify the information given
Adam had 33 books initially. He sold a fraction of them (11/100, which is equivalent to 11% of 33).

Step 3: Calculate the number of books sold
To find the number of books sold, multiply the initial number of books by the fraction sold:

33 books x (11/100) = 33 x 0.11 = 3.63 books (round down to 3 books, since you can't sell a fraction of a book)

So, Adam sold 3 books.

Step 4: Calculate the money earned from selling books
Assuming each book is sold for the same price, the money earned from selling 3 books is:

Money earned = Number of books sold x Price per book
Let's assume the price per book is $5 (this is arbitrary, but it's a number for the sake of calculation). Then:

Money earned = 3 books x $5/book = $15

Step 5: Calculate the number of new books bought
Adam uses the money earned to buy 23 new books. The cost of these new books is:

Cost of new books = Number of new books x Price per book
Let's assume the price per new book is $5 (again, arbitrary). Then:

Cost of new books = 23 books x $5/book = $115

Step 6: Calculate the remaining money
Since Adam spent $115 on new books, he has $15 (the money earned from selling books) left over.

Step 7: Calculate the total number of books Adam has
Adam started with 33 books, sold 3 books, and bought 23 new books. To find the total number of books, add the number of books remaining after selling to the number of new books bought:

Total number of books = Initial number of books - Number of books sold + Number of new books
= 33 books - 3 books + 23 books
= 53 books

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Nancy has 2 shelves of mystery books.
* Nancy has 6 shelves of picture books.
* Each shelf has exactly 6 books.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of mystery books.

* Since Nancy has 2 shelves of mystery books, and each shelf has 6 books, the total number of mystery books is:

* Gwen recycled 5 pounds of paper.
* Her friends recycled 13 pounds of paper.
* For every 3 pounds of paper recycled, they earn 1 point.

Step 2: Calculate the total pounds of paper recycled by Gwen and her friends.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the number of pictures taken at the zoo and the museum.
Rachel took 6 pictures at the zoo and! 9 pictures at the museum.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pictures taken.
To do this, we need to add the number of pictures taken at the zoo and the museum. Since! represents ""minus"", we can rewrite the equation as:
6 - 9 =?

Step 3: Evaluate the expression.
6 - 9 = -3

So, Rachel took a total of -3 pictures.

Step 4: Determine the number of pictures deleted.
Rachel deleted 11 pictures.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of pictures remaining.
To do this, we need to subtract the number of pictures deleted from the total number of pictures taken.
-3 - 11 =?

Step 6: Evaluate the expression.
-3 - 11 = -14

So, Rachel has -14 pictures remaining.

{The final answer is -14.}

Note: The final answer is a negative number, indicating that Rachel deleted more pictures than she took, resulting in a net loss of 14 pictures.<|eot_id|>",4,4.0,14.0

                    question:
                    . Maria was making baggies of cookies with 8 cookies in each bag. If she had 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could? she make?!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of cookies Maria has.

Maria has 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies. To find the total number of cookies, we add these two numbers together:

5 (chocolate chip) + 19 (oatmeal) = 24 cookies

Step 2: Determine how many baggies Maria can make with 8 cookies in each bag.

Since each baggie has 8 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies (24) by 8 to find out how many baggies Maria can make:

24 cookies Ã· 8 cookies/bag = 3 baggies

Step 3: Check if there are any remaining cookies.

Since we divided the total number of cookies by 8, we can check if there are any remaining cookies by multiplying the result by 8 and comparing it to the total number of cookies:

3 baggies Ã— 8 cookies/bag = 24 cookies

Since the result is equal to the total number of cookies, we know that Maria can make exactly 3 baggies with 8 cookies in each bag.

{The final answer is} Maria can make 3 baggies.<|eot_id|>",3,3.0,3.0

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the cost of each flower
The problem states that each flower is $3.

Step 2: Determine the number of flowers Zoe bought
Zoe bought 8 roses and 2 daisies. To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and daisies:

8 (roses) + 2 (daisies) = 10 flowers

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the flowers
Since each flower costs $3, we multiply the total number of flowers by the cost of each flower:

10 flowers x $3/flower = $30

Step 4: Check for any additional costs or discounts
The problem doesn't mention any additional costs or discounts, so we can assume the total cost is the final answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Bianca has 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books.
We know that each shelf has exactly 8 books on it.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of books on the mystery book shelves.
Since there are 5 shelves of mystery books, and each shelf has 8 books, we can multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf to get the total number of mystery books:
5 shelves x 8 books/shelf = 40 mystery books

Step 3: Calculate the total number of books on the picture book shelves.
Since there are 4 shelves of picture books, and each shelf has 8 books, we can multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf to get the total number of picture books:
4 shelves x 8 books/shelf = 32 picture books

Step 4: Add the total number of mystery books and picture books to get the total number of books.
We can add the number of mystery books (40) and picture books (32) to get the total number of books:
40 mystery books + 32 picture books = 72 books

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cards John has to organize.
He has 8 new cards and 16 old cards, so he has a total of:
8 (new) + 16 (old) = 24 cards

Step 2: Determine how many cards can fit on each page.
Since each page can hold 3 cards, we can divide the total number of cards by 3 to find the number of pages needed:
24 cards Ã· 3 cards per page = 8 pages

Step 3: Check if there are any remaining cards.
Since John has 24 cards and each page can hold 3 cards, he will use 8 pages (as calculated in Step 2). This means he will have:
24 cards - (8 pages Ã— 3 cards per page) = 24 - 24 = 0 cards left over

Since there are no remaining cards, John will use exactly 8 pages to organize his baseball cards.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Isabel baked 3 brownies, but she needs 5 total for her party.

This means that Isabel already has 3 brownies, and she needs to make 2 more to have a total of 5 brownies.

Step 2: Isabel used 5 cups of flour for each brownie.

This means that she used a total of 3 x 5 = 15 cups of flour for the 3 brownies she already made.

Step 3: Isabel needs to make 2 more brownies to have a total of 5.

To make these 2 additional brownies, she will need more flour. Since she uses 5 cups of flour for each brownie, she will need 2 x 5 = 10 more cups of flour.

Step 4: Isabel already has 15 cups of flour, and she needs 10 more cups.

To find out how much flour she still needs, we subtract the amount she already has (15 cups) from the amount she needs (10 cups):

15 cups - 10 cups = 5 cups

{The final answer is} Isabel needs 5 cups of flour.<|eot_id|>",10,10.0,5.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Tom bought 40 tickets initially.

Step 2: He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth. To find out how many tickets he has left, we subtract 28 from 40:

40 - 28 = 12

So, Tom has 12 tickets left.

Step 3: He wants to use the remaining tickets for rides. Each ride costs 4 tickets. To find out how many rides he can go on, we need to divide the number of tickets he has left (12) by the cost of each ride (4):

12 Ã· 4 = 3

The chef already had 8 chicken wings cooked.

Step 2: Identify the additional number of chicken wings cooked by the chef for the group.
The chef cooked 10 more chicken wings for the group.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of chicken wings cooked for the group.
To do this, we add the initial number of chicken wings cooked (8) to the additional number of chicken wings cooked (10):

8 + 10 = 18

Step 4: Divide the total number of chicken wings cooked by the number of friends in the group.
There are 3 friends in the group, and we want to divide the total number of chicken wings cooked equally among them.

To do this, we divide the total number of chicken wings cooked (18) by the number of friends (3):

18 Ã· 3 = 6

Step 5: Determine how many chicken wings each person would get.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: John starts with 33 socks.

Step 2: He throws away 19 old socks that didn't fit. To find out how many socks he has left, I'll subtract 19 from 33:

33 - 19 = 14

So, John has 14 socks left.

Step 3: John buys 13 new socks. To find out how many socks he has now, I'll add 13 to the 14 socks he had left:

Step 2: Determine the group size.
The coach wants to put the players into groups with 4 players in each group.

Step 3: Divide the total number of players by the group size.
To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players (8) by the group size (4):

8 Ã· 4 = 2

Step 4: Check the result.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Determine the total time it takes to paint all 6 rooms.
Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the total time to paint all 6 rooms would be:
6 rooms Ã— 5 hours/room = 30 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time already spent painting 2 rooms.
Since the painter has already painted 2 rooms, the time already spent is:
2 rooms Ã— 5 hours/room = 10 hours

Step 3: Subtract the time already spent from the total time to paint all 6 rooms.
To find the remaining time needed to paint the rest of the rooms, subtract the time already spent from the total time:
30 hours - 10 hours = 20 hours

Step 4: Determine how much longer it will take to paint the rest of the rooms.
Since the painter still needs to paint 4 rooms (6 rooms - 2 rooms already painted), the remaining time needed to paint the rest is:

                    question:
                     A waiter had 22 customers in his section. If, 14 of them left and the rest of his, tables had 4 people at, each table, how many tables did he have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of customers
The waiter had 22 customers in his section initially.

Step 2: Identify the number of customers who left
14 customers left.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of customers
To find the remaining number of customers, subtract the number of customers who left from the initial number of customers:
22 (initial customers) - 14 (customers who left) = 8

Step 4: Identify the number of people per table
The rest of the tables had 4 people at each table.

Step 5: Calculate the number of tables
Since there are 8 remaining customers, and each table has 4 people, we can divide the remaining number of customers by the number of people per table to find the number of tables:
8 (remaining customers) Ã· 4 (people per table) = 2

Step 6: Check the answer
We have found that the waiter has 2 tables remaining. This makes sense, as 2 tables with 4 people each would account for the 8 remaining customers.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Roger started with 120 pieces of clothing to wash.

Step 2: He put 48 pieces of clothing in one load. To find out how many pieces of clothing are left, we subtract 48 from 120:

120 - 48 = 72

So, there are 72 pieces of clothing left.

Step 3: Roger decided to split the remaining 72 pieces of clothing into 9 equal loads. To find out how many pieces of clothing can go in each load, we divide 72 by 9:

72 Ã· 9 = 8

So, each of the small loads can hold 8 pieces of clothing.

The problem states that there were 10 students at the start of the year.

Step 2: Determine the number of students who left.
The problem states that 4 students left during the year.

Step 3: Subtract the number of students who left from the initial number of students.
10 (initial students) - 4 (students who left) = 6

So, there were 6 students remaining from the initial group.

Step 4: Determine the number of new students who joined.
The problem states that 42 new students came to school.

Step 5: Add the new students to the remaining students.
6 (remaining students) + 42 (new students) = 48

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Roger is helping put away books at the library. A librarian takes 2 books away, leaving Roger with the rest.

Step 2: Determine the number of books Roger has left
The librarian takes 2 books away, so Roger is left with the original 14 books minus 2. To find the number of books Roger has left, we subtract 2 from 14:

14 - 2 = 12

So, Roger has 12 books left.

Step 3: Determine how many shelves Roger needs
Roger can fit 3 books on a shelf. To find out how many shelves he needs, we need to divide the number of books he has left (12) by the number of books he can fit on a shelf (3):

12 Ã· 3 = 4

So, Roger needs 4 shelves to put away the 12 books he has left.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the total number of flowers Bianca picked.
Bianca picked 39 tulips and 49 roses. To find the total number of flowers, I add the two numbers together:

39 (tulips) + 49 (roses) = 88

So, Bianca picked a total of 88 flowers.

Step 2: Identify the number of flowers Bianca used.
Bianca used 81 flowers to make the bouquets.

Step 3: Find the difference between the total number of flowers and the number of flowers used.
To find the number of extra flowers Bianca picked, I subtract the number of flowers used from the total number of flowers:

88 (total flowers) - 81 (flowers used) = 7

Step 4: Interpret the result.
The result, 7, indicates that Bianca picked 7 extra flowers beyond what she used to make the bouquets.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of students on the debate team.
We are given that there are 26 boys and 46 girls. To find the total number of students, we add these numbers together:

Total students = 26 (boys) + 46 (girls) = 72

Step 2: Determine the number of students in each group.
We are told that the students are to be split into groups of 9. To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of students by 9:

Number of groups = Total students Ã· 9
= 72 Ã· 9
= 8

Step 3: Check if there are any remaining students.
When we divided the total number of students by 9, we got a whole number of groups (8). This means that we can make 8 groups of 9 students each. To check if there are any remaining students, we can calculate the remainder:

72 (total students) - (8 x 9) = 72 - 72 = 0

Since the remainder is 0, there are no remaining students. This means that we can make exactly 8 groups of 9 students each.

Step 2: Identify the number of students who wanted fruit.
According to the problem, only 5 students wanted fruit.

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples needed for the students.
Since each student wants fruit, and there are 5 students, the total number of apples needed is:
5 students x 1 apple/student = 5 apples

Step 4: Calculate the number of extra apples the cafeteria has.
The cafeteria ordered a total of 21 apples, and only 5 apples are needed for the students. To find the number of extra apples, subtract the number of apples needed from the total number of apples ordered:

Step 2: They sold 3 books. To find the number of books remaining, we subtract 3 from 4:

4 - 3 = 1

So, after selling 3 books, there is 1 book left in the bin.

Step 3: The book store then put 10 more books in the bin. This means we add 10 to the 1 book that was already there:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Olivia uploaded a total of 5 + 35 = 40 pictures to Facebook.

Step 2: She sorted the pictures into 8 different albums.

Step 3: Since there are the same number of pictures in each album, we can divide the total number of pictures (40) by the number of albums (8) to find the number of pictures in each album.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of cookies Robin has in total.
She has 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies, so the total number of cookies is:

23 (chocolate chip) + 25 (oatmeal) = 48 cookies

Step 2: Determine how many cookies are needed for each baggie.
Each baggie has 6 cookies.

Step 3: Divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies needed for each baggie.
To find out how many baggies Robin can make, we divide the total number of cookies (48) by the number of cookies needed for each baggie (6):

48 cookies Ã· 6 cookies per baggie = 8 baggies

Step 4: Check if there are any leftover cookies.
When dividing the total number of cookies by the number of cookies needed for each baggie, we may have a remainder. In this case, we don't have any leftover cookies, as the division is exact:

48 Ã· 6 = 8 with no remainder

{The final answer is 8 baggies of cookies.}<|eot_id|>",8,8.0,8.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1:** Cody had $45 initially.

**Step 2:** He got $9 more dollars as a birthday gift. To find out how much money he has now, we add the initial amount to the additional amount:

$45 + $9 = $54

**Step 3:** However, Cody spent $19 on a new game. To find out how much money he has now, we subtract the amount spent from the total amount:

$54 - $19 =?

**Step 4:** To calculate the result, we subtract $19 from $54:

$54 - $19 = $35

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Wendy uploaded a total of 22! + 2 ; pictures to Facebook. We need to combine these two quantities.

! represents multiplication, so 22! means 22 multiplied by itself, which is 22 Ã— 22 = 484.

; represents addition, so 2 ; means 2 added to itself, which is 2 + 2 = 4.

So, Wendy uploaded a total of 484 + 4 = 488 pictures to Facebook.

Step 2: Wendy sorted the 488 pictures into 4 different albums with the same number of pictures in each album.

To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures (488) by the number of albums (4).

488 Ã· 4 = 122

Step 3: Therefore, there are 122 pictures in each of the 4 albums.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial amount of candy Katie and her sister have combined.

Katie has 8 pieces of candy, and her sister has 23 pieces. To find the total amount of candy, we add these two numbers together:

8 (Katie's candy) + 23 (sister's candy) = 31

So, Katie and her sister have a total of 31 pieces of candy combined.

Step 2: Determine how many pieces of candy they ate the first night.

They ate 8 pieces of candy the first night.

Step 3: Subtract the number of pieces eaten from the total amount of candy.

To find out how many pieces of candy they have left, we subtract the number of pieces eaten (8) from the total amount of candy (31):

31 (total candy) - 8 (pieces eaten) = 23

So, Katie and her sister have 23 pieces of candy left.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of trays Jerry needs to pick up from each table.

* Table 1: 9 trays
* Table 2: 7 trays

Step 2: Identify the maximum number of trays Jerry can carry in one trip.

* Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time.

Step 3: Calculate the number of trips Jerry needs to make to pick up all trays from Table 1.

* Jerry needs to pick up 9 trays from Table 1. Since he can carry 8 trays at a time, he will need to make:
	+ 1 trip to carry 8 trays
	+ 1 additional trip to carry the remaining 1 tray (since he can't carry 9 trays in one trip)

So, Jerry needs to make 2 trips to pick up all trays from Table 1.

Step 4: Calculate the number of trips Jerry needs to make to pick up all trays from Table 2.

* Jerry needs to pick up 7 trays from Table 2. Since he can carry 8 trays at a time, he will need to make:
	+ 1 trip to carry 7 trays (since 7 is less than or equal to 8)

So, Jerry needs to make 1 trip to pick up all trays from Table 2.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of trips Jerry needs to make.

* Jerry needs to make 2 trips to pick up trays from Table 1.
* Jerry needs to make 1 trip to pick up trays from Table 2.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The chef needs to cook 12 potatoes.
* He has already cooked 6 potatoes, which means there are 12 - 6 = 6 potatoes left to cook.

Step 2: Determine the time it takes to cook one potato

* Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to cook the remaining potatoes

* Since there are 6 potatoes left to cook, and each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, we can multiply the number of potatoes by the time it takes to cook one potato:
6 potatoes x 6 minutes/potato = 36 minutes

Step 4: Determine the total time it will take to cook all the potatoes

* The chef has already cooked 6 potatoes, which took 6 x 6 = 36 minutes. To cook the remaining 6 potatoes, it will take an additional 36 minutes.
* Therefore, the total time it will take to cook all the potatoes is the sum of the time it took to cook the first 6 potatoes and the time it will take to cook the remaining 6 potatoes:
36 minutes + 36 minutes = 72 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Faye and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Faye picked 23 and her mother picked 5. We need to find out how many bad carrots they have.

Step 2: Identify the total number of carrots picked
Faye picked 23 carrots, and her mom picked 5 carrots. To find the total number of carrots picked, we add these numbers together:

23 (Faye's carrots) + 5 (mom's carrots) = 28 carrots

Step 3: Determine the number of good carrots
The problem states that only 12 of the carrots were good. This means that the remaining carrots are bad.

Step 4: Find the number of bad carrots
To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the number of good carrots (12) from the total number of carrots picked (28):

28 (total carrots) - 12 (good carrots) = 16 bad carrots

                    question:
                     Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school. started,? how many? did he not wash?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of shirts Sam had to wash.
Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts. To find the total number of shirts, we add these two numbers together:

40 (short sleeve) + 23 (long sleeve) = 63 shirts

Step 2: Identify the number of shirts Sam had washed by the time school started.
According to the problem, Sam had washed 29 shirts by the time school started.

Step 3: Find the number of shirts Sam had not washed.
To find the number of shirts Sam had not washed, we subtract the number of shirts he had washed (29) from the total number of shirts he had to wash (63).

63 (total shirts) - 29 (shirts washed) = 34 shirts

Step 4: Write the answer.
{The final answer is} 34 shirts.<|eot_id|>",34,34.0,34.0
" A waiter . had 47 customers to wait on. If 41 customers left and . he got another 20 customers, how many customers would he have? ","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     A waiter. had 47 customers to wait on. If 41 customers left and. he got another 20 customers, how many customers would he have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The waiter initially has 47 customers to wait on.

Step 2: 41 customers leave. To find out how many customers are left, we subtract 41 from 47:

47 - 41 = 6

So, the waiter has 6 customers left.

Step 3: The waiter gets 20 new customers. To find out the total number of customers he now has, we add the 6 customers he had left to the 20 new customers:

6 + 20 = 26

Step 4: The final answer is the total number of customers the waiter has now.

{The final answer is 26 customers.}<|eot_id|>",26,26.0,26.0
