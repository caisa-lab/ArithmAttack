You defeated 8 enemies out of a total of 11.

Step 2: Calculate the number of points earned for defeating those enemies.
Number of points = Number of enemies defeated * Points per enemy
Number of points = 8 * 9

Step 3: Add the points earned from defeating the remaining enemies.
Since there were 11 enemies in total and you defeated 8, there are 3 enemies left.
Number of points from remaining enemies = 3 * 9

Step 4: Add the points from both defeated and remaining enemies to find the total points earned.
Total points = Points from defeated enemies + Points from remaining enemies
Total points = (8 * 9) + (3 * 9)

Step 5: Calculate the value of the expression.
Total points = 72 + 27

                 [/INST] To find out how many shirts Ned did not wash, we first need to find out how many shirts he washed. Let's break this down step by step:

1. Ned had 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts.
2. He washed 29 shirts before school started.
3. To find out how many shirts he washed, we add the number of short sleeve shirts he washed to the number of long sleeve shirts he washed.
4. We know he washed 29 shirts, so the number of short sleeve shirts he washed is: 9 (short sleeve shirts) - (number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash)
5. We can set up an equation to find the number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash:
   9 (short sleeve shirts) - 29 (total shirts washed) = -20 (this is incorrect, the left side should equal the number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash)
6. Solving the equation for the number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash:
   Number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash = 9 (short sleeve shirts) - 29 (total shirts washed)
   = -18 (which is not a valid number)
7. Since the result is not valid, we made an error somewhere. Let's go back to step 5 and correct the equation:
   9 (short sleeve shirts) - 29 (total shirts washed) = number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash
8. Solving the equation for the number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash:
   number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash = 9 (short sleeve shirts) - 29 (total shirts washed)
   = -20 (which is not valid, because we cannot have a negative number of shirts)
9. We made an error in the equation. We need to add the number of long sleeve shirts Ned washed to the number of short sleeve shirts he washed.
10. Setting up the correct equation:
   29 (short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts Ned washed) = 9 (short sleeve shirts) + number of long sleeve shirts
11. Solving the equation for the number of long sleeve shirts Ned didn't wash:
   number of long sleeve shirts he didn't wash = 29 (short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts Ned washed) - 9 (short sleeve shirts)
   = 20 (long sleeve shirts)

Therefore, {The final answer is: Ned didn't wash 20 long sleeve shirts}.</s>",1,1.0,20.0

                    question:
                     A company invited 47 : people to a , luncheon, but 7 of them didn't ? show up. If the tables they had held 5 people each, how : many tables ; do they . need? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many people actually showed up at the luncheon.
Total number of people invited = 47
Number of people who didn't show up = 7

Number of people who actually showed up = Total number of invited people - Number of no-shows
= 47 - 7 = 40 people

Step 2: Calculate how many tables are needed to seat all the attendees.
Each table seats 5 people.

Number of tables needed = Number of people / Seats per table
= 40 / 5 = 8 tables

However, since we cannot divide exactly by 5, it is common to round up to ensure everyone has a seat. So, the company would actually need 9 tables.

{The final answer is: The company needs 9 tables to accommodate all the attendees.}</s>",8,8.0,9.0

                 [/INST] Step 1: Tom initially had 5 books.

Step 2: Tom sold 4 books, so he has 5 (initial books) - 4 (sold books) = <bold>1</bold> book left.

Step 3: Tom used the earnings from selling 4 books to buy 38 new books. Let's find out how many books Tom can buy with the earnings from selling 4 books.

Step 4: Assume the price of one new book is $x. Then, Tom sold 4 books, so he got 4 * $x (money from selling old books).

Step 5: Tom bought 38 new books, so we can set up the equation: 4 * $x = 38 * $price_per_new_book

Step 6: To find the price of one new book ($price_per_new_book), we can calculate it from the above equation: $price_per_new_book = 38 * (1 / 4) * $x

Step 7: We don't have enough information to find a specific value for $x. However, we can find the total number of books Tom has after selling the old books and buying new ones.

Step 8: Tom had 1 book left after selling 4 books. He then bought 38 new books, so we need to find the total number of books Tom has after this: 1 (remaining old book) + 38 (newly bought books).

Step 9: The final answer is: <bold>Tom has a total of 39 books.</bold></s>",39,39.0,39.0

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    !  For a birthday party Jerry bought ? 41 regular : sodas and : 22 diet ? sodas. If his : fridge would : only ! hold ! 9 on each shelf, how ! many shelves would he fill , up? , 
                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Jerry needs to fill up with his sodas, we first need to find out how many sodas he bought in total and then divide that number by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.

1. Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. Therefore, he bought a total of:
   Regular sodas = 41
   Diet sodas = 22
   Total sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas = 41 + 22 = 63

2. The fridge can only hold 9 sodas on each shelf. So, to find out how many shelves Jerry needs, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas per shelf:
   Shelves = Total sodas / Sodas per shelf = 63 / 9 = 7

3. However, since Jerry can't have a fraction of a shelf, he may need to round up to ensure he has enough space for all his sodas. He can fit 7 complete shelves of 9 sodas each, so the remaining sodas must be placed on an 8th shelf. We can calculate the number of sodas that can fit on the 8th shelf:
   Sodas on 8th shelf = Total sodas - (Shelves * Sodas per shelf) = 63 - (7 * 9) = 63 - 63 = 0
   Since he can't fit any sodas on the 8th shelf, it seems there is a mistake in the number of sodas Jerry bought or the number of sodas each shelf can hold.

After checking the inputs, we find there was an error in the problem. The number of diet sodas should be 31 instead of 22 to make the total number of sodas equal to 63, which can fit in 7 shelves.

{The final answer is: Jerry needs 7 shelves to store all his sodas.}</s>",7,7.0,7.0

Debby had 32 pieces of candy.
Her sister had 42 pieces of candy.
So, the total number of candies they had combined is:
32 (Debby's candy) + 42 (Sister's candy) = 74

Step 2: Determine how many pieces of candy they ate on the first night.
They ate 35 pieces of candy.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pieces of candy left after eating on the first night.
Total number of candies they had = 74

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Emily started with 41 seeds. She planted 29 seeds in the big garden. Therefore, the number of seeds she planted in the small gardens is:
Seeds in small gardens = Total seeds - Seeds in big garden
= 41 - 29
= 12 seeds

2. We also know that Emily put 4 seeds each in her small gardens. So the number of small gardens she has is:
Number of small gardens = Seeds in small gardens / Seeds per small garden

1. The toy store had 17 giant stuffed bears in stock.
2. They received another shipment with 10 bears.
3. They put the bears on shelves with 9 on each shelf.

First, let's find out how many bears they have in total now:
Initial bears = 17
Bears from the new shipment = 10
Total bears = Initial bears + Bears from the new shipment
Total bears = 17 + 10
Total bears = 27

Now, we need to find out how many bears can fit on one shelf:
Bears on one shelf = Number of bears per shelf
Bears on one shelf = 9

To find out how many shelves they used, we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears that can fit on one shelf:

Number of shelves = Total bears / Bears on one shelf
Number of shelves = 27 / 9
Number of shelves ≈ 3

Since they cannot fit a small fraction of a shelf, they would need to add one more shelf to make sure all the bears have a place on the shelves.

1. Determine the total number of team members.
   The team had 5 boys, so there were 5 × 1 = 5 boys in total.
   They had 40 girls, so there were 40 girls in total.
   Therefore, the total number of team members is 5 boys + 40 girls = 45 members.

2. Calculate how many groups of 9 team members can be formed from the total number of team members.
   To find the number of groups, divide the total number of team members by the number of team members in each group.
   The number of groups is given by:
   Number of groups = Total team members / Members per group = 45 / 9 = ≈5.111
   
3. Since it's not possible to form a group with a fraction of a team member, the team can form 5 complete groups of 9 members, with a remaining member not included in any group.

2. She started with 9 roses and had 4 roses left.
3. To find out how much money she earned during the sale, we need to find out how many roses she sold.
4. The number of roses she sold is the difference between the number of roses she started with and the number of roses she had left.

So,
Number of roses sold = Initial number of roses - Final number of roses
= 9 - 4
= 5 roses

5. Now, we know that each rose was sold for 7 dollars.
6. Therefore, the total earnings for April during the sale are the number of roses sold multiplied by the price per rose.

                 [/INST] To find out how many cats are left at the pet store, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of cats. Here are the steps:

1. We know that the pet store had 13 Siamese cats and 5 house cats, so the total number of cats was:
   Initial number of cats = Siamese cats + House cats
   = 13 + 5
   = 18

2. During a sale, they sold 10 cats. We don't know how many of each type of cat were sold, but we do know that the total number of cats sold was 10.

3. Therefore, the number of cats left at the pet store is:
   Number of cats left = Initial number of cats - Number of cats sold
   = 18 - 10

1. Adam initially had 48 books.
2. He sold 19 of them.
3. With the money he earned from selling those 19 books, he bought 38 new books.

First, let's find out how many books Adam has left after selling 19.
{ The number of books Adam has left = Initial number of books - Number of books sold }
{ The number of books Adam has left = 48 - 19 }

Step 2:
{ The number of books Adam has left = 29 }

Now, we know that Adam used the money he earned by selling 19 books to buy 38 new books. Let's find out how many books in total Adam now has.

{ Total number of books Adam has = Books Adam had left + New books he bought }

Step 3:
{ Total number of books Adam has = 29 + 38 }

                 [/INST] To find out how many vans are needed for Nancy's class to go on the field trip, we first need to determine how many people are in the class in total: students + adults

Given information:
- There are 12 students.
- There are 3 adults.

People in the class = Students + Adults
People in the class = 12 + 3
People in the class = 15

Now we need to find out how many people each van can hold and then divide the total number of people by the number of people per van to get the number of vans needed.

Given information:
- Each van can hold 5 people.

Number of vans = Total number of people / People per van
Number of vans = 15 / 5
Number of vans = 3

However, since vans come in whole units, they will need to round up and get an additional van to ensure everyone can attend the field trip.

                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Tom would need to fill up, we need to determine how many sodas he has in total and then divide that number by the number of sodas that can be stored on each shelf.

Step 1: Find the total number of sodas Tom bought.
Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas, so the total number of sodas is:

Total sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
Total sodas = 4 + 52
Total sodas = 56

Step 2: Divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can be stored on each shelf.
We need to find out how many shelves Tom would need to fill up completely. To do this, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can be stored on each shelf:

Shelves needed = Total sodas / Sodas per shelf
Shelves needed = 56 / 7
Shelves needed ≈ 8.03

Since Tom cannot have a fraction of a shelf, he would need to round up and use 9 shelves to store all of his sodas.

1. For the first table, Luke needs to pick up 20 trays. He can carry 4 trays at a time, so the number of trips needed from the first table is: 
20 trays ÷ 4 trays per trip = 5 trips

2. For the second table, Luke needs to pick up 16 trays. He can still carry 4 trays at a time, so the number of trips needed from the second table is:
16 trays ÷ 4 trays per trip = 4 trips

3. To find the total number of trips Luke makes, we add the number of trips to the first table and the number of trips to the second table:

Step 4: To find the amount of money Henry needs to finish his collection, we need to determine how many more action figures he needs to buy.

Step 5: Since Henry currently has 3 action figures and needs a total of 8, he needs to buy an additional number of action figures, which can be calculated as follows:

Number of action figures needed = Total action figures in a complete collection - Current number of action figures
Number of action figures needed = 8 - 3
Number of action figures needed = 5

Step 6: Now that we know Henry needs to buy 5 more action figures, we can calculate the total cost of finishing his collection:

Next, we can calculate the cost for the adults by multiplying the number of adults by the cost of an adult meal.

 cost for adults = number of adults * cost per adult meal

                 [/INST] Step 1: Roger had 25 books. He sold 21 of them, so the number of books Roger currently has is:
25 (initial number of books) - 21 (number of books sold) = {The number of books Roger has now is 4 books}

Step 2: Roger used the money he earned from selling the 21 books to buy 30 new books. To find out how much money Roger earned from selling the 21 books, we first need to find out how much each book sold for:

Since Roger went from having 25 books to having 4 books after selling 21 books, each book must have sold for:
Price per book = (Initial number of books - Number of books after sale) / Number of books sold
Price per book = (25 - 4) / 21
Price per book = 21 / 21
Price per book = 1 book

So, each book sold for 1 dollar. Since Roger sold 21 books, the total amount of money he earned is:
Total earnings = Number of books sold * Price per book
Total earnings = 21 * 1 = {21 dollars}

Step 3: With 21 dollars, Roger bought 30 new books. To find out the price of each new book, we divide the total amount of money he spent on the new books by the number of new books he bought:
Price of each new book = Total spending on new books / Number of new books
Price of each new book = 21 (total earnings) / 30 (number of new books) = 0.7 dollars (approximately)

Step 4: With the total earnings of 21 dollars and the price of each new book of approximately 0.7 dollars, we can now calculate the number of new books Roger bought:
Number of new books = Total earnings / Price per new book
Number of new books = 21 dollars / 0.7 dollar = approximately 30 new books

Step 5: To find the total number of books Roger now has, we simply add the number of books he had left after selling the 21 books to the number of new books he bought:
Total number of books = Initial number of books (after sale) + Number of new books
Total number of books = 4 (books after sale) + 30 (new books) = {34 books}

Step 2: Calculate how many lives Wendy lost during the hard part of the game. She lost 6 lives.

Step 3: Find out how many new lives Wendy gained in the next level. She gained 37 additional lives.

Step 4: Add up the lives Wendy had initially, the lives she lost, and the lives she gained to find the total number of lives.

First, let's calculate the number of lives Wendy had after losing 6 lives in the hard part:
Initial lives = 10
Lives lost = 6

Lives after losing 6 = Initial lives - Lives lost
Lives after losing 6 = 10 - 6

Step 4 (continued):
Lives after losing 6 = 4

Now let's add the new lives Wendy gained:
Total lives = Lives after losing 6 + New lives

Total players = new players + returning players
Total players = 48 + 6
Total players = 54

Step 2: Divide the total number of players by the number of players per group.
Number of groups = Total players / Players per group
Number of groups = 54 / 6

Step 3: Perform the division operation.
Number of groups ≈ 9.0

Step 4: Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up or down to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round up because having one extra group ensures that all players have a spot in a group.

1. Nancy had 80 files in total.
2. She deleted 31 files, so now she has 80 - 31 = <ins>49 files</ins>.

Next, we need to figure out how many files go into each folder:

3. Each folder holds 7 files.
4. To find out how many folders Nancy needs, we divide the number of remaining files by the number of files per folder: 49 ÷ 7 ≈ <ins>7.05714...</ins>. This result is not reasonable for the number of folders, so we need to find the next whole number above our result that will evenly divide the number of remaining files.

   Remaining games = 39 - 19 = 20

2. Next, let's find out how many games each box can hold.
   Number of games per box = 4

3. To determine how many boxes Luke needs, we'll divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many students were picked for the trivia teams. We know that 17 students didn't get picked, so we subtract the number of students who weren't picked from the total number of students who tried out.

Total students = 65
Students not picked = 17
Students picked = Total students - Students not picked = 65 - 17 = 48

Step 2: Since the rest of the students were put into 8 groups, we can find the number of students in each group by dividing the total number of students who were not picked by the number of groups.

Students in each group = Total students not picked / Number of groups = 48 / 8

Step 3: We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.

First, let's find out how many shirts Dave washed. He washed 20 shirts before school started. Now, we know that 9 of those were short sleeve shirts, so those are included in the 20. That leaves us with the number of long sleeve shirts that were washed before school started. Since 9 short sleeve shirts were already accounted for, we have:

20 total shirts washed before school - 9 short sleeve shirts = <<20-9=11>>11 long sleeve shirts

Now, to find out how many shirts Dave did not wash, we need to subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts he had to wash before school:

Total shirts to wash before school = 9 short sleeve shirts + 27 long sleeve shirts = 36 shirts
Number of shirts Dave washed before school = 11 long sleeve shirts

So, the number of shirts that Dave did not wash is:

1. We know that Will put 32 pieces of clothing in one large load.
2. He decided to split the rest into 9 small loads.
3. Let X be the number of pieces in one small load.
4. The total number of pieces of clothing Will had is 59 (excluding the 32 pieces in one large load).
5. Therefore, the number of pieces of clothing in the remaining 8 small loads is 59 - 32 = 27.
6. The number of pieces in 8 small loads is 8 * X.
7. Since the number of pieces in 8 small loads is equal to the total number of pieces Will had, we can set up the equation: 8X = 27.
8. Solving for X, we get X = 27/8.
9. Since X must be a whole number (as it represents the number of pieces of clothing), 27 is not divisible by 8, so this problem does not have a solution. {The final answer is: There is no solution as the number of pieces for one small load cannot be a whole number in this scenario.}</s>",3,3.0,8.0

                 [/INST] To find out how many new books Victor bought, we first need to determine how many books he brought home in total and how many of those were used.

1. Let's find out how many new books Victor bought of each type:
   - Adventure books: He bought 32 adventure books.
   - Mystery books: He bought 37 mystery books.

2. We know that 16 books were used. However, the problem statement does not clarify which type of books (adventure or mystery) were used. So, let's assume an equal number of adventure and mystery books were used:

   - Let _x_ be the number of used adventure books.
   - Let _y_ be the number of used mystery books.

3. Since 16 books were used in total, and he had an equal number of adventure and mystery books, we can write the following equation:

   x + y = 16

4. We know that Victor bought 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books. So, the total number of new books he purchased is:

   New adventure books = 32
   New mystery books = 37
   
   Total new books = New adventure books + New mystery books

5. Let's find the solution for x and y from our equation:

   Since 16 = x + y, we know that x = 16 - y.

   Now, let's substitute _x_ in the equation from step 1:

   32 + 37 = 2 * (16 - y)

6. Simplifying the equation:

   69 = 32 + 37 - 2 * y
   69 = 69 - 2 * y
   0 = -2 * y

7. Since _y_ cannot be negative, this equation has no solution. It seems that there is an inconsistency in the problem statement, as it presents contradicting information.

8. Based on the provided information, Victor's total purchase of new books cannot be determined without clarifying whether used adventure books and used mystery books were taken into account. {The final answer is: Unable to determine the number of new books bought based on the information given.}</s>",53,53.0,8.0

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the total number of problems Katie had to complete step by step:

1. Katie had 7 pages of math homework, and each page had 9 problems. So, the number of math problems is 7 pages × 9 problems/page = 63 problems.

2. She also had 3. pages of reading homework, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we need to convert 3. pages to an integer by multiplying it by the number of problems per page. So, 3. pages × 9 problems/page = 2.7 problems/page × 9 pages/problem = 24.3 problems, but since this can't be a valid number, we assumed there was an error in the problem statement as there's no way to have a fraction of a problem. However, if we just want to find the total number of reading problems, but without considering the fractional part in the final answer, then 3 pages would equal 27 problems (3 pages × 9 problems/page).

3. To find the total number of problems she had to complete, we simply add the number of math problems and the number of valid reading problems:
   63 math problems + 27 reading problems = 90 problems

{The final answer is: 90 problems}

Please note, if the problem statement was meant to be interpreted as having 3. pages of reading homework and each page having 9 reading problems, then there seems to be an issue in the provided information as that would give an invalid result (total number of problems = 24.3), and it is essential to clarify such ambiguities before starting calculations.</s>",90,90.0,24.3

85 (original files) - 40 (deleted files) = 45 files

Next, we'll find out how many files are in each folder. We know there are 5 files in each folder:

To find out how many folders Katie has, we divide the number of remaining files by the number of files per folder:

folders = number of files / files per folder
= 45 files / 5 files per folder
= 9 folders (with a remainder of 0)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a folder, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, that means 9 folders in total.

                 [/INST] To find out how much money Will made in two days, we need to calculate his earnings for each day and then add them together.

First, we know that Will made $8 per hour. So, on Monday, when he worked for 8 hours, his earnings were:

Monday's earnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked
                         = $8/hour * 8 hours

Step 2: Calculate how many books can fit on one shelf.
Oliver can fit 4 books on one shelf.

Step 3: Determine how many shelves Oliver needs to store all the books.

                     Gwen and her friends were ! recycling paper for , their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one ! point. If Gwen ? recycled 5 . pounds ! and her friends recycled 13 pounds, how many points did they earn? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many points Gwen earned for recycling 5 pounds of paper.
Since for every 3 pounds they recycled, they earned one point, we first need to find out how many 3-pound increments are in 5 pounds.
5 pounds ÷ 3 pounds/increment = 1 remainder 2 pounds
So, Gwen recycled 1 point for her 3-pound contribution, and she had an extra 2 pounds that didn't contribute to additional points because there's a limit of one point per 3 pounds.

Step 2: Determine how many points Gwen's friends earned for recycling 13 pounds.
Since they earned one point for every 3 pounds, we simply divide the total pounds recycled by 3:
13 pounds ÷ 3 pounds/point = 4.333 points
However, since they cannot earn a fraction of a point, we round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, they earned 4 points.

Step 3: Add the points earned by each person to find the total number of points earned by both Gwen and her friends.
Total Points = Points earned by Gwen + Points earned by her friends
Total Points = 1 point (for 3 pounds of Gwen's paper) + 4 points (for 13 pounds of her friends' paper)

{The final answer is: Total Points = 5 points}

Note: In the calculation of the total points, the error is due to the misunderstanding of the question that one pound of paper recycled earns one point, not one point per three pounds of paper recycled, this results in the total points calculated as 5 instead of the actual 4.5 points the team earned. So the corrected answer should have been {The final answer is: Total Points = 4.5 points}.

To clarify the process further, let's go over the steps once more, but with correct numbers:

Step 1: Determine how many points Gwen earned for recycling 5 pounds of paper.
5 pounds ÷ 3 pounds/increment = 1.667 points (rounded up since there is a fraction of a pound)
So, Gwen recycled 2 points for her 3 pounds of contribution (1 point for the full 3 pounds + 1 extra point for 1 pound remaining).

Step 2: Determine how many points Gwen's friends earned for recycling 13 pounds.
13 pounds ÷ 3 pounds/point = 4.333 points
Since they cannot earn a fraction of a point, they earned 4 points for their 13 pounds of recycled paper.

Step 3: Add the points earned by each person to find the total number of points earned by both Gwen and her friends:
Total Points = Points earned by Gwen + Points earned by her friends
Total Points = 2 points (for 3 pounds of Gwen's paper) + 4 points (for 13 pounds of her friends' paper)

{The final answer is: Total Points = 6 points}

                 [/INST] To find out how much Haley spent on tickets for herself, her friends, and extra tickets, we need to calculate the cost of each group separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how much Haley spent on tickets for herself:
Cost of tickets for Haley = Number of tickets for Haley * Price per ticket
Cost of tickets for Haley = 3 * $4
Cost of tickets for Haley = $12

Next, let's find out how much she spent on tickets for her friends:
Cost of tickets for friends = Number of tickets for friends * Price per ticket
Since the problem states ""her friends"" but doesn't specify a number for the friends, we will assume that she bought an equal number of tickets for herself and for her friends. In this case, that would be 3 tickets for her friends as well.
Cost of tickets for friends = 3 * $4
Cost of tickets for friends = $12

Now, let's find out how much she spent on the extra tickets:
Cost of extra tickets = Number of extra tickets * Price per ticket
Cost of extra tickets = 5 * $4
Cost of extra tickets = $20

To find the total amount spent by Haley on tickets, we simply add up the cost of tickets for herself, the cost of tickets for her friends, and the cost of the extra tickets:
Total amount spent = Cost of tickets for Haley + Cost of tickets for friends + Cost of extra tickets
Total amount spent = $12 + $12 + $20

First, let's find the number of parrots in one cage:

Number of parrots per cage = 8

Next, let's find the number of parakeets in one cage:
Number of parakeets in one cage = Parakeets per cage
Parakeets per cage = 2

Now, we can find the total number of birds in one cage:
Total birds in one cage = Parrots per cage + Parakeets per cage
Total birds in one cage = 8 + 2
Total birds in one cage = 10

Finally, we can find the total number of birds in the pet store by multiplying the number of birds in one cage by the number of cages:

Now, we know that she sorted the pictures into 9 different albums, each with the same amount of pictures. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

Pictures in each album = Total pictures uploaded / Number of albums
Pictures in each album = 36 / 9
Pictures in each album = 4

However, since she cannot have a fraction of a photo in an album, she would need to round up or down to the nearest whole number.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many cookies are in total.
Total number of cookies = Chocolate chip cookies + Oatmeal cookies
Total number of cookies = 5 * 5 (since there are 5 chocolate chip cookies and they come in bundles of 5) + 19
Total number of cookies = 5 * 5 + 19
Total number of cookies = 25 + 19
Total number of cookies = 44

Step 2: Determine how many cookies go in each baggie.
Each baggie contains 8 cookies.

Step 3: Determine how many baggies Maria can make with the total number of cookies.
Number of baggies = Total number of cookies / Cookies per baggie
Number of baggies = 44 / 8

Step 2: We are given that she has 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books.

Step 3: To find out the total number of books Bianca has, we need to find out how many books are on each type of shelf and then add them together.

Step 4: We know that each shelf of mystery books has exactly 8 books and there are 5 such shelves:

Mystery books = Number of shelves * Books per shelf
Mystery books = 5 * 8
Mystery books = 40

Step 5: Similarly, we know that each shelf of picture books has exactly 8 books and there are 4 such shelves:

Picture books = Number of shelves * Books per shelf
Picture books = 4 * 8
Picture books = 32

Step 6: To find the total number of books Bianca has, we simply add the number of mystery books and picture books together:

Total books = Mystery books + Picture books

                    question:
                     John was organizing his baseball ? cards ; in , a binder with 3 on ; each page. If . he had 8 new cards ; and 16 : old cards to . put in the binder, how many ! pages would he use? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of pages needed for the new cards.
Since John has 8 new cards and each page can hold 3 cards, the number of pages required for the new cards is:
New pages = Number of new cards / Cards per page
New pages = 8 / 3

Step 2: Determine the number of pages needed for the old cards.
John has 16 old cards. Since each page can hold 3 cards, the number of pages needed for the old cards is:
Old pages = Number of old cards / Cards per page
Old pages = 16 / 3

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pages John will use.
Total pages = New pages + Old pages
Total pages = (8 / 3) + (16 / 3)

Step 4: Simplify the calculation.
To simplify the calculation, we can find a common denominator for the denominators of the two fractions, which is 3.
Total pages = (2.666... + 5.333...)

Step 5: Add the two fractions.
Total pages = (2 * 1 + 2 * 1 + 1 * 1 + 3 * 1 + 3 * 1 + 3 * 1) / 3
Total pages = (7 + 6 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 9) / 3
Total pages = 26/3

Step 6: Simplify the answer.
Although we cannot simplify the fraction fully (i.e., it cannot be simplified to a term with a whole number in the numerator and the denominator being coprime), the final answer is the simplified fraction 26/3.

However, in practical scenarios, if you want to round it off for convenience, you might choose to record it as approximately 8.67 pages.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Isabel baked 3 brownies, but she needed 5 brownies for her party. This means that she is missing the recipe for 2 more brownies.

Step 2: Each brownie requires 5 cups of flour. So, for the 3 brownies she has already made, Isabel has used:
3 brownies * 5 cups flour/brownie = 15 cups flour

Step 3: Since she needs a total of 5 brownies for her party, the amount of flour she still needs is:
5 brownies * 5 cups flour/brownie = 25 cups flour

Step 4: The total amount of flour Isabel has used and still needs is:
15 cups flour (from the brownies she's already made) + 25 cups flour (for the 2 more brownies she needs to make) = 40 cups flour

   = 26 students
3. Eleven new students came to the class, so we need to add that number to the students remaining.
   Final students = Students remaining + Students joined

1. We know that for every 3 pounds of recycled paper, Bianca earns one point.

2. Bianca recycled 24 pounds. So, the number of points she earned is:
points for Bianca = (weight recycled by Bianca) / (pounds of paper recycled for one point)
points for Bianca = 24 / 3
points for Bianca = 8

3. Her friends recycled 3 pounds. So, the number of points they earned is:

Step 2: Therefore, the chef cooked a total of 8 (previously cooked) + 10 (newly cooked) = <12>18<18> chicken wings for the group.

Step 3: Since the friends all got the same amount, let x be the number of chicken wings each person received.

Step 4: We know that the chef cooked a total of 18 chicken wings for the group, so:

x (for each friend) × Number of friends = Total number of chicken wings

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups the coach can form with 8 players (2 new players + 6 returning players) and each group having 4 players, we can simply divide the total number of players by the number of players per group.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of players: 2 new players + 6 returning players = 8 players

Step 2: Divide the total number of players by the number of players per group: 8 players / 4 players per group = 2 groups of 4 players

However, since the question asks for the number of groups, we can't have a fraction of a group. Instead, we need to calculate the greatest number of complete groups that can be formed. In this case, that would be 2 full groups of 4 players each, for a total of 4 players.

So, since the coach can't form a third group with only 2 remaining players, the final answer is:

1. First, let's find out how long it takes to paint all the rooms in the building. Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the total time to paint all rooms is: 5 hours per room * 6 rooms = 30 hours

2. However, the painter has already painted 2 rooms, which took him 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 hours.

3. Now we need to find out how long it takes to paint the remaining rooms. Since there are 6 rooms in total and the painter has already painted 2, there are 4 rooms left to paint.

4. So, the time it takes to paint the remaining rooms is 5 hours per room * 4 rooms = 20 hours.

5. To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the remaining rooms, we need to subtract the time he has already spent painting from the total time it takes to paint all the rooms: 30 hours (total time) - 10 hours (time already spent) = 20 hours (time remaining to paint the rest of the rooms).

2. 14 of them left, so that leaves us with 22 - 14 = 8 customers still at the tables.
3. We're told that the remaining tables have 4 people at each table.
4. To find out how many tables there are, we need to divide the number of people at the tables by the number of people per table: 8 customers / 4 customers per table = 2 tables.
5. However, we made an mistake in step 3 when we assumed that all the remaining customers were at the same table. We should have considered that there might be more than one table with people.
6. Let's assume there is only one additional table. In this case, we would have 2 tables with 4 people each and 1 table with 2 people. The total number of people at the tables would be 2 * 4 + 1 * 2 = 8 people, which is the same as in the problem.

Therefore, {The final answer is}: the waiter had at least 3 tables in his section. However, it's also possible that he had more than 3 tables if there were smaller groups of customers or empty tables as well.</s>",2,2.0,3.0

                 [/INST] Let's go through the problem step by step:
1. Roger had 120 pieces of clothing to wash.
2. He put 48 of them in one load.
3. He decided to split the rest into smaller loads.
4. He made 9 equal loads.

First, let's find out how many pieces of clothing are in each large load and each small load.

We know that Roge put 48 pieces in one large load.

To find out how many pieces of clothing are in each small load, we need to find out how many pieces are in each small load in comparison to the large load.

Since Roger split the remaining clothes into 9 equal loads, we can find out how many pieces are in each small load by dividing the total number of pieces left by the number of small loads:

Total pieces of clothing = 120
Pieces in one large load = 48
Number of small loads = 9

Now, we can calculate the number of pieces in one small load:

Total pieces in small loads = Total pieces of clothing - Pieces in large loads * number of large loads
Total pieces in small loads = 120 - (48 * 1) - (48 * 8)
Total pieces in small loads = 120 - 48 - 384
Total pieces in small loads = -228

Since we cannot have a negative number, we made an error in our calculation. Let's go back and check the calculation for the large load:

Pieces in one small load = Total pieces in small loads / Number of small loads
Pieces in one small load = (-228) / 9

We made an error with the calculation of pieces in one large load that resulted in our error with pieces in one small load. Let's go back and double-check it:

Pieces in one large load = 48
Total pieces of clothing = 120
Number of large loads = 1 + (Total pieces in small loads / Pieces in one small load)
Number of large loads = 1 + (120 / Pieces in one small load)

We know that the total number of pieces in 10 loads (one large load + 9 small loads) should be equal to the total number of pieces of clothing:

Total pieces in large and small loads = Total pieces of clothing = 120
Pieces in one large load + (Number of small loads * Pieces in one small load) = 120

Let's first calculate the number of pieces in all the small loads:

Total pieces in small loads = Total pieces of clothing - Pieces in large loads
Total pieces in small loads = 120 - 48
Total pieces in small loads = 72

Now, we can calculate the number of pieces in each small load:

Pieces in one small load = Total pieces in small loads / Number of small loads
Pieces in one small load = 72 / 9
Pieces in one small load = 8

However, we made an error in our initial calculation. The amount of pieces in one large load was 48 instead of 120. Therefore, in order to find the total number of clothes in one load, we have to calculate it based on the number of small loads:

Pieces in one large load = Total pieces in large and small loads - Total pieces in small loads
Pieces in one large load = 120 - 72
Pieces in one large load = 48

Since we already found that pieces in one small load = 8, then our final answers are:

{The final answer is} - Roger can wash 48 pieces of clothing in one large load, and 8 pieces of clothing in each small load. Therefore, he needs a total of 12 loads to wash all 120 pieces of clothing.</s>",8,8.0,120.0

Step 2: During the year, 4 students left the class. So, the number of students who were in the class but then left is 10 (initial number of students) - 4 (students who left) = 6.

Step 3: Additionally, 42 new students came to the class. So, the number of students who joined the class during the year is 42.

Step 4: To find the total number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to add the number of students who were initially in the class, the number who left, and the number who joined.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of books Roger is left with after the librarian takes some away.
The total number of books is 14, and the librarian takes 2 books. Therefore, Roger is left with 14 - 2 = 12 books.

Step 2: Determine how many books Roger can fit on each shelf.
Each shelf can hold 3 books.

Step 3: Determine how many shelves Roger needs to accommodate all the remaining books.
Divide the total number of books Roger has left by the number of books each shelf can hold.
Number of shelves = Total number of books / Books per shelf
Number of shelves = 12 / 3

Step 4: Calculate the exact number of shelves needed.
Since you can't divide by 3 exactly, round up to the nearest whole number because it's unrealistic to have a fraction of a shelf. So, 12 ÷ 3 = 4 with a remainder of 0. Therefore, Roger will need 5 shelves to put away all the books.

                 [/INST] To find the total number of minutes it took Emily to put together all the new furniture, we first need to determine how many minutes it took her to put together each chair and each table. We are given that it took her 8 minutes for one piece of furniture. Since she bought 4 chairs and 2 tables, we have:

1. Number of minutes to put together one chair = 8 minutes
2. Number of chairs = 4
3. Number of minutes to put together one table = 8 minutes
4. Number of tables = 2

To find the total number of minutes it took her to put together all the chairs, we multiply the number of minutes it takes to put together one chair by the number of chairs:

Total minutes for chairs = Number of minutes for one chair × Number of chairs
Total minutes for chairs = 8 minutes ×4
Total minutes for chairs = 32 minutes

To find the total number of minutes it took her to put together all the tables, we perform a similar calculation:

Total minutes for tables = Number of minutes for one table × Number of tables
Total minutes for tables = 8 minutes ×2
Total minutes for tables = 16 minutes

To find the total number of minutes it took her to put together all the furniture, we add the total minutes for chairs and the total minutes for tables:

Total minutes = Total minutes for chairs + Total minutes for tables
Total minutes = 32 minutes + 16 minutes
Total minutes = 48 minutes

Step 2: In each cage, there are 2 parrots and 7 parakeets.

Step 3: So, the number of birds in one cage is the number of parrots plus the number of parakeets.

Step 4: We have that the number of birds in one cage is 2 parrots + 7 parakeets = 2 + 7 = 9 birds.

Step 5: Thus, the total number of birds in the pet store is the number of bird cages multiplied by the number of birds in each cage.

2. By the time school started, Dave had only washed 20 shirts.
3. To find out how many shirts Dave did not wash, we need to subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts he had to wash.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of pictures Haley took during her vacation.
Haley took 50 pictures at the zoo, and she took 8 pictures at the museum. So, the total number of pictures she took is: 50 (zoo) + 8 (museum) = <<50+8=58>>58 pictures.

Step 2: Calculate the number of pictures Haley deleted.
She deleted 0.38 of her pictures. Since we have the total number of pictures but not the number of deleted pictures, we need to find out how many pictures that fraction corresponds to. To do this, we multiply the total number of pictures by the fraction: 58 (pictures) * 0.38 (fraction) = <<58*0.38=22.08>>22.08 (pictures). Since we cannot have a fraction of a picture, we round this number down to the nearest whole number: 22 pictures.

Step 3: Subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures to find out how many pictures Haley still has.
Total pictures = 58
Deleted pictures = 22
So, the number of pictures Haley still has is: 58 (total) - 22 (deleted) = <<58-22=36>>36 pictures.

                 [/INST] To determine how many groups the debate team can form with a certain number of students, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students per group and see if any remainder exists, as we can't have a fraction of a group.

First, let's find the total number of students:
Total students = Boys + Girls
Total students = 26 + 46
Total students = 72

Next, we'll find out how many students there are in each group:
Students per group = 9

Now, we can calculate how many full groups we can make:
Number of full groups = Total students / Students per group
Number of full groups = 72 / 9
Number of full groups ≈ 8.04

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to form groups with only whole number of students. This means we can form 8 full groups and we have 72 - (8*9) = 6 students left over.

So we can form 8 full groups of 9 students each, but with these students we cannot form a new full group. That means, the total number of groups is equal to the number of full groups + any remaining students that could form a small group.

Number of groups = Number of full groups + Remaining students / Students per group
Number of groups = 8 + 6 / 9
Number of groups = 8 + 0.67
Number of groups = 8.67

Rounding down this doesn't make much sense because, in this case, we could potentially form a group of 3 students. So, rounding up is the better solution.

Therefore, the debate team can make a total of 9 groups with the students they have.

3. To find the time it takes to cook the remaining 8 potatoes, we can use the same rate of 6 minutes per potato: 8 potatoes * 6 minutes/potato = 48 minutes.

Therefore, the final answer is: it will take the chef 30 minutes (for the potatoes already cooked) + 48 minutes (for the potatoes that remain to be cooked) = 78 minutes to cook all 13 potatoes. {The final answer is 78 minutes.}</s>",48,48.0,78.0

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many math problems Paige had in total. We know she had 43 math problems for homework, and she finished 44 problems at school. So, the number of math problems Paige had for homework is:

43 (math problems for homework) + 44 (problems finished at school) = 87 math problems

Therefore, {The number of math problems Paige had for homework is 87}.

Next, we need to find out how many science problems she had for homework. The problem states that she had 12 science problems for homework, so:

Science problems for homework = 12

Thus, {The number of science problems for homework is 12}.

To find the total number of problems Paige had for homework, we simply add the math problems and science problems together:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem
April had a sale where each flower was discounted by a certain amount and she sold roses for 8 dollars each and daisies were not specified in price during the sale. Vanessa bought 3 roses and 3 daisies. The question is asking for the total amount spent by Vanessa.

Step 2: Identify the known and unknown variables
The price of each rose during the sale is known, which is 8 dollars. The number of roses and daisies bought by Vanessa is also known, which is 3 for each. The discounted price of daisies during the sale is unknown.

Step 3: Find the cost of roses
The cost of 3 roses is 3 * 8 = $<<3*8=24>>24.

Step 4: Assumption
Since the question doesn't mention anything about the price of daisies during the sale being different from that of roses or not, it's reasonable to assume that the price of daisies was also 8 dollars during the sale.

Step 5: Find the cost of daisies
The cost of 3 daisies, assuming they were also 8 dollars each, would be 3 * 8 = $<<3*8=24>>24.

Step 6: Find the total amount spent
The total amount spent by Vanessa is the sum of the cost of roses and daisies, which is $24 for each + $24 for the other flowers = $<<24+24=48>>48.

                    question:
                     Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 8 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in . each of the albums? . 
                 [/INST] To find out how many pictures were in each album, we first need to find out how many pictures Olivia has in total. She uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 pictures from her camera, so:

Total pictures = Pictures from phone + Pictures from camera
= 5 + 35
= 39

Now, we want to distribute these pictures amongst 8 different albums, each with the same number of pictures. To do this, we'll find the number of pictures in each album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

Number of pictures in each album = Total pictures / Number of albums
= 39 / 8
≈ 4.875

Since we cannot have a fraction of a picture, we'll need to round this number up to the nearest whole number to ensure each album has at least as many pictures as the next one, and round down for the remaining pictures. So, we'll have:

- 4 albums with 5 pictures each (a total of 20 pictures)
- 1 album with 4 pictures (leftover from the round up)
- 3 albums with 5 pictures and 1 picture left over (a total of 5 + 1 = 6 pictures)

But since the total number of pictures (39) is greater than the number of pictures distributed to the albums (20 + 4*3 = 24), we'll still need to distribute the remaining pictures evenly amongst the albums. Since we've already rounded up for some albums, we'll need to round down for the remaining albums:

- 1 album with 4 pictures (from rounding up earlier)
- 3 albums with 5 pictures and 0 pictures left over
- 4 albums with 5 pictures and 1 picture left over (round down to ensure each album has at least 5 pictures)

Therefore, the final answer is that each album should contain 5 pictures, with a total of 43 pictures distributed amongst the 8 albums. However, since Olivia only had 39 pictures in total, this solution is not feasible, making the original question impossible to answer as it is. {The final answer is NOT applicable}.</s>",5,5.0,39.0

First, let's find out how many baggies Robin can make with chocolate chip cookies:

Number of baggies with chocolate chip cookies = Total number of chocolate chip cookies / Number of cookies per bag
= 23 chocolate chip cookies / 0.6 cookies per bag
= 38.83... ≈ 39 baggies (Since Robin can't make a fraction of a baggie, she'll make 39 baggies with a little extra)

Next, let's find out how many baggies Robin can make with oatmeal cookies:

Number of baggies with oatmeal cookies = Total number of oatmeal cookies / Number of cookies per bag
= 25 oatmeal cookies / 0.6 cookies per bag
= 41.67... ≈ 42 baggies

Finally, let's find the total number of baggies Robin can make:

Total number of baggies = Number of baggies with chocolate chip cookies + Number of baggies with oatmeal cookies

We have a school baseball team with 12 new players and 44 returning players. The coach wants to put all the players into groups with 8 players in each group. We need to find out how many groups there will be.

Step 2: Inside each box, there are 5 scarves and 5 mittens. First, let's find out how many scarves and mittens are in each box.

Step 3: In one box, there are 5 scarves and 5 mittens. So, the total number of items in one box is 5 scarves + 5 mittens = 10 items.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that the chef has cooked 6 potatoes and each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

Step 2: So, the chef has spent 6 potatoes * 6 minutes per potato = 36 minutes on cooking potatoes so far.

Step 3: We need to find out how long it will take for the chef to cook the remaining 6 potatoes (12 potatoes total - 6 potatoes cooked).

Step 4: Since each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, the chef will need an additional 6 potatoes * 6 minutes per potato = 36 minutes to cook all 12 potatoes.

Step 5: However, we've already accounted for the initial 36 minutes the chef spent on cooking the first 6 potatoes.

Step 6: Therefore, the chef will need an extra 0 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes (since the additional 36 minutes of cooking time was already included in our initial calculation).

Step 7: However, this answer doesn't make much sense, as the chef needs to spend some time cooking the remaining potatoes.

Step 8: Let's check our calculations again. We made an error on Step 5, where we assumed that the initial 36 minutes were included in the calculation for cooking the remaining potatoes. In fact, we need to add this time to the total cooking time.

Step 9: The chef has already spent 36 minutes cooking 6 potatoes. He needs to cook 6 more potatoes, which will take another 6 potatoes * 6 minutes per potato = 36 minutes.

Step 10: Adding the time spent on cooking the first 6 potatoes (36 minutes) and the remaining 6 potatoes (36 minutes), we get a total cooking time of 36 minutes + 36 minutes = 72 minutes.

                 [/INST] I. First, let's determine how many games Luke had remaining after selling 39 of them.

II. We know he started out with 57 games and sold 39, so:
57 (initial games) - 39 (sold) = 18 games remaining.

III. Next, we need to determine how many games go into each box.

IV. According to the problem text, Luke packed 2 games into each box, so:
18 games ÷ 2 games per box = 9 boxes needed to pack all remaining games.

V. However, the question asks for the number of boxes Luke ""had to use,"" which might imply that he had more boxes on hand than just the ones needed to pack his remaining games. Since the problem text doesn't provide additional information on this, I cannot guarantee a definitive answer as there could be more or fewer boxes than mentioned here.

But, knowing the number of boxes needed to store the 18 remaining games, we can determine that:
Luke needed at least 9 boxes to use.

Step 1: Find out how many puppies were sold.
13 puppies => Sold 7 puppies

Step 2: Find out how many puppies were left after selling 7.
13 puppies (initial) => Sold 7 puppies => 6 puppies remaining

Step 3: Determine how many puppies can fit into one cage.

Step 1: Find the total number of good carrots picked by Faye and her mother.
Total good carrots = Carrots picked by Faye + Carrots picked by her mother
Total good carrots = 23 (Faye's carrots) + 5 (her mother's carrots) = 28 carrots

Step 2: Subtract the total number of good carrots from the total number of carrots given in the problem to find the number of bad carrots. The total number of carrots is not provided in the problem, but the total number of good carrots (28) is. We are told that only 12 of the carrots were good.

Total carrots = Total good carrots + Total bad carrots
Total carrots = 28 (good carrots) + Total bad carrots

Step 3: Solve for the total number of bad carrots.
Total bad carrots = Total carrots - Total good carrots
Total bad carrots = 28 (good carrots) + Total bad carrots - 28

To find the total time it took her to put together all the furniture, we need to find out how many pieces of furniture there are in total and then multiply that number by the time it took to put together one piece.

3. There are 4 chairs and 4 tables, so there are a total of 4 + 4 = 8 pieces of furniture.

Therefore, Ned bought a total of 50 + 27 = <<50+27=77>>77 games.

But 74 of those games didn't work. So, we need to find out how many games did work. We do that by subtracting the number of broken games from the total number of games:

                     While , playing a trivia ? game, ! Frank : answered 3 : questions ; correct in the first half . and 2 questions ! correct ! in the ; second half. ? If , each ? question ? was worth 3 ; points, : what was his final score? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of points Frank earned in the first half.
Frank answered 3 questions correctly in the first half. Therefore, his points for the first half are:
Points in first half = Number of correct answers in first half * Points per question
Points in first half = 3 * 3
Points in first half = 9

Step 2: Determine the number of points Frank earned in the second half.
Frank answered 2 questions correctly in the second half. Therefore, his points for the second half are:
Points in second half = Number of correct answers in second half * Points per question
Points in second half = 2 * 3
Points in second half = 6

Step 3: Find Frank's total number of points.
Total points = Points in first half + Points in second half
Total points = 9 + 6
Total points = 15

                    :  . Zoe was ? unboxing some , of ; her old winter clothes. . She found , 8 boxes of ? clothing , and inside each box . there were 4 ? scarves ! and 6 mittens. ; How , many : pieces ? of . winter clothing did . Zoe have . total? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the variables in the problem.
- Zoe unboxed some boxes of winter clothes.
- There were 8 boxes.
- Inside each box, there were 4 scarves.
- Inside each box, there were 6 mittens.

Variables: number of boxes (8), number of scarves in each box (4), and number of mittens in each box (6).

Step 2: Calculate the number of scarves and mittens in total.
First, let's find out how many scarves and mittens Zoe has in total:

Number of scarves = Number of boxes * Number of scarves per box
= 8 * 4
= 32 scarves

Number of mittens = Number of boxes * Number of mittens per box
= 8 * 6
= 48 mittens

Step 3: Determine the total number of winter clothing pieces.
Since we know there are only scarves and mittens in the boxes, we can calculate the total number of winter clothing pieces as follows:

Total number of winter clothing pieces = Number of scarves + Number of mittens
= 32 scarves + 48 mittens
= 80 pieces

{The final answer is 80 pieces of winter clothing.}</s>",80,80.0,80.0

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the cost of each deck.
The cost of each trick deck is $7.

Step 2: Determine how many decks Frank bought.
Frank bought 3 decks.

Step 3: Determine how many decks Frank's friend bought.
Frank's friend bought 2 decks.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount spent by Frank.
Total amount spent by Frank = Number of decks Frank bought * Cost of each deck
Total amount spent by Frank = 3 * $7
Total amount spent by Frank = $21

Step 5: Calculate the total amount spent by Frank and his friend.
Total amount spent by both = Total amount spent by Frank + Total amount spent by Friend
Total amount spent by both = $21 + ($7 * 2)
Total amount spent by both = $21 + $14
Total amount spent by both = $35

The final answer is: $35.</s>",35,35.0,35.0

                     Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts , before school. If : he : had ? only , washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many shirts Sam didn't wash, we first need to determine how many shirts he did wash. We know he washed 29 shirts by the time school started. The total number of shirts he had to wash were 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts. So the total number of shirts is 40 + 23 = <<40+23=63>>63.

Therefore, the number of shirts he didn't wash is:
63 (total shirts) - 29 (shirts he washed) = <<63-29=34>>34.

The final answer is that Sam did not wash 34 shirts.</s>",34,34.0,34.0

                 [/INST] Step 1: The waiter had 47 customers to begin with.

Step 2: 41 customers left, so the number of customers the waiter has left to wait on is:
Total customers after first group left = Initial number of customers - Customers who left
= 47 - 41
= 6 customers

Step 3: The waiter got another 20 customers. So, the total number of customers the waiter now has are:
Total customers = Customers after first group left + Customers who joined later
= 6 + 20
= 26 customers
