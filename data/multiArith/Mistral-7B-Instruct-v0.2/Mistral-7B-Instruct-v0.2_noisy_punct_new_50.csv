                    question:
                    .  Paige , had 11 . songs on her . mp3 player. If ! she deleted 9 old songs ! from : it , and then . added : 8 new . songs, how , many : songs , does she ! have ? on her mp3 player? : 
                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. Paige initially had 11 songs on her mp3 player.
2. She deleted 9 old songs, reducing her number of songs by 9.
3. After deleting old songs, she added 8 new songs to her mp3 player.
4. To find out how many songs Paige has now, we need to find the difference between the number of songs she had after deleting old ones and the number of songs she has now after adding new ones.

So, the calculation would be: 
11 (initial number of songs) - 9 (old songs deleted) + 8 (new songs added)

{The final answer is: 11 - 9 + 8 = 12 songs}

Therefore, Paige now has 12 songs on her mp3 player.</s>",10

                    question:
                    ?  , There were 39 girls and , 4 . boys trying out for ; the : schools , basketball ! team. If ! only 26 ! of ? them got ! called back, how many students didn't ; make ? the cut? ? 
                 [/INST] First, let's clarify the given information:
1. There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the basketball team.
2. A total of 26 students were called back.

To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we need to find the number of students who tried out in total and subtract the number of students who were called back:

Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total number of students = 39 + 4
Total number of students = 43

So, the number of students who didn't make the cut is the total number of students who tried out minus the number of students who were called back:

Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students - Number of students who were called back
Number of students who didn't make the cut = 43 - 26

The final answer is {17 students didn't make the cut}.</s>",17

                 [/INST] To find out how many coloring books Faye has after giving some away and buying more, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Faye had 34 coloring books initially.
2. She gave away 3 books. So, we need to subtract 3 from the initial number of books.

Coloring books Faye had = 34
Number of books she gave away = 3

3. After giving away 3 books, Faye had:

Coloring books Faye had = Initial number of books - Books given away
= 34 - 3
= 31

4. Then, she bought 48 more books. We need to add this number to the number of coloring books she had after giving some away.

Number of books she bought = 48

5. Faye's new total number of coloring books is:

Total number of coloring books = Coloring books Faye had + Books she bought
= 31 + 48
= 79

{The final answer is: Faye has a total of 79 coloring books.}</s>",79

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem.
Given: The school cafeteria had 23 apples. They used 20 apples to make lunch for an undetermined number of students. Then, they bought 6 more apples.

Step 2: Determine the number of apples used for lunch.
Since 20 apples were used for lunch, no information about the number of students is given. Without knowing the number of students, it's impossible to determine how many apples were left or how many apples were bought in total. Hence, we cannot find the final number of apples.

{The final answer is: We cannot determine the final number of apples based on the given information.}</s>",9

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find out how many points we get for defeating one enemy. It's given that each enemy defeated gives us 9 points.

Step 2: Next, we need to find out how many points we would earn if we defeat all the enemies in a level. We know that there are 11 enemies in total, and we get 9 points for each enemy defeated. So,

Total points = Points per enemy * Number of enemies
= 9 * 11
= 99

Step 3: However, we're not defeating all the enemies. We're only defeating 8 of them. So, we need to find out how many points we would earn for defeating 8 enemies.

Points earned for defeating 8 enemies = Points per enemy * Number of enemies defeated
= 9 * 8
= 72

Step 4: Therefore, the final answer is:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many bags of cans Megan recycled. The problem states that she recycled 19 bags and each bag earned her 8 points. So, to find out how many points she earned in total, we can multiply the number of bags she recycled by the number of points per bag.

Total points = Number of bags recycled * Points per bag
= 19 bags * 8 points/bag
= 152 points

Step 2: Determine how many bags of cans Megan did not recycle. The problem states that she had 19 bags in total but only recycled 14. So, we can calculate how many bags she didn't recycle by subtracting the number of bags she did recycle from the total number of bags.

Bags not recycled = Total number of bags - Number of bags recycled
= 19 bags - 14 bags
= 5 bags

Step 3: Determine how many points Megan did not earn by not recycling those 5 bags. We can use the same formula as before to find out how many points she would have earned for those 5 bags.

Points not earned = Number of bags not recycled * Points per bag
= 5 bags * 8 points/bag
= 40 points

{The final answer is that Megan earned 152 points from recycling 14 bags and could have earned an additional 40 points if she had recycled all 19 bags.}</s>",72

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many roses April sold during the sale. We know that she started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left. Therefore,she sold:

```
13 roses (starting amount) - 4 roses (left) = 9 roses
```

Step 2: Next, we need to calculate the revenue April earned from selling these 9 roses. Each rose was sold for $4, so:

```
Revenue = Number of roses sold * Price per rose
Revenue = 9 roses * $4/rose
Revenue = $36
```

Step 3: Thus, the final answer to the problem is:

{The final answer is: $36}.</s>",36

                 [/INST] To find out how many shirts Ned did not wash, we first need to determine how many shirts he washed. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. We know that Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts.
2. The total number of shirts that Ned had to wash is the sum of the number of short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts.
3. So, the total number of shirts is 9 (short sleeve) + 21 (long sleeve) = 30 shirts.
4. We're given that Ned only washed 29 shirts by the time school started.
5. Therefore, the number of shirts that Ned did not wash is the difference between the total number of shirts and the number of shirts that he washed.

The final answer is: 30 (total shirts) - 29 (washed shirts) = 1 shirt. So, Ned did not wash 1 shirt before school. {The final answer is: 1 shirt.}</s>",1

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many people actually showed up.
Since 7 people didn't show up, and 47 people were invited:
47 (invited) - 7 (no-shows) = 40 (people who showed up)

Step 2: Calculate how many tables were needed to seat the people who showed up.
With each table seating 5 people:
40 (people) / 5 (people per table) = 8 (tables needed)

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Tom had 5 : books. So, Tom had 5 books initially. {The initial number of books Tom had is 5}.
2. If Tom sold 4 : of them :, then the number of books Tom had was reduced by 4. {Tom sold 4 books, so now Tom has 5 - 4 = 1 book}.
3. Tom used the money he earned to buy 38 new books. Hence, the number of books Tom now has is the number of books he had initially plus the number of new books he bought.
4. Therefore, the final number of books Tom has = Initial number of books + New books bought
5. Substituting the values, we get: Final number of books = 5 + 38 = 43

                     ! For , a ; birthday party . Jerry ? bought 41 regular sodas . and 22 diet sodas. . If : his fridge . would ; only , hold , 9 on ? each : shelf, how , many shelves would he fill ; up? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Jerry would need to fill up with his sodas, we first need to determine the total number of sodas he bought and then divide that number by the maximum capacity of each shelf in his fridge.

Step 1: Find the total number of sodas Jerry bought.
Regular sodas = 41
Diet sodas = 22
Total number of sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
Total number of sodas = 41 + 22
Total number of sodas = 63

Step 2: Determine how many sodas can fit on each shelf in Jerry's fridge.
Maximum capacity of each shelf = 9

Step 3: Find out how many shelves Jerry would need to fill up.
Number of shelves = Total number of sodas / Maximum capacity of each shelf
Number of shelves = 63 / 9

Step 4: Simplify the fraction
Number of shelves = 7

Step 5: Since Jerry can't have a fraction of a shelf, we round up to the next whole number to ensure all the sodas have a space.
Number of shelves = 8

{The final answer is 8 shelves}</s>",7

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     . For ! Halloween Emily received ! 5 ! pieces of candy from : neighbors and 13 pieces ! from her , older sister. , If ; she : only ate 9 pieces a ? day, ! how . long ? would . the candy ; last ? her? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of candy pieces Emily received.
She received 5 pieces from each of her neighbors, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 pieces. She received 13 pieces from her older sister.
Total candy pieces = 10 (from neighbors) + 13 (from her older sister) = <<10+13=23>>23 pieces.

Step 2: Determine how long the candy would last if she ate 9 pieces a day.
Days until no more candy = Total candy pieces / Pieces eaten per day
Days until no more candy = 23 / 9

Step 3: Calculate the result of the division.
You can use a calculator or perform long division:
23 ÷ 9 = 2 remainder 5
So, Days until no more candy = 2 (rounded down since we're measuring by days) + 5/9 = 2 + 0.556 (approximately). Since we're measuring in whole days, this doesn't make practical sense. To get an answer in whole days, we'd round 2 up to 3 and disregard the remainder, resulting in an overestimation of how long the candy will last. However, if you want to be very precise, you could calculate how long 5/9 of a day is and add that to the whole number of days.

The final answer, when approximating with whole days, is 3 days. When being more precise, the answer is roughly 3.56 days (approximately 3 days and a half day).</s>",2

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many books Mike is left with after the librarian takes 10.

Given that there are 82 books to put away and 10 are taken by the librarian, we can find out how many books Mike is left with:

82 (total books) - 10 (books taken by librarian) = 72 books (for Mike)

Step 2: Determine how many books Mike can fit on one shelf.

We know from the problem statement that Mike can fit 9 books on a shelf.

Step 3: Determine how many shelves Mike needs to put away all of his books.

To find out how many shelves Mike needs, we need to divide the total number of books he has by the number of books that can fit on one shelf:

72 (books for Mike) / 9 (books per shelf) ≈ 8 shelves (rounded up because we can't have a fraction of a shelf)

Therefore, the final answer is: Mike needs approximately 8 shelves to put away all of his books.</s>",8

14 windows in total are needed.
8 windows have been installed already.
So, the number of windows the builder still needs to install is: 14 - 8 = 6 windows

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to install one window.
It takes 8 hours to install one window.

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to install all the remaining windows.
The builder needs to install 6 windows.
It takes 8 hours to install one window.
Therefore, the time it takes to install all the remaining windows is: 6 windows * 8 hours/window = 48 hours.

First, let's find the number of oranges remaining after they threw away the old ones: 40 oranges (initial number) - 25 oranges (thrown away) = 15 oranges.
Now, add the 21 new oranges to the 15 old oranges: 15 oranges (old) + 21 oranges (new) = 36 oranges.

So, {The final answer is 36 oranges in the bin}.</s>",36

- The waiter had 7 customers at lunch.
- 5 of them didn't leave a tip.
- The waiter got $3 from each customer who left a tip.

Step 2: Find out how many customers left a tip
- We know that 5 customers didn't leave a tip.
- So, the number of customers who left a tip is the total number of customers minus the number who didn't leave a tip: 7 - 5 = 2 customers

Step 3: Calculate the income from tipped customers
- Each tipped customer left a tip of $3.
- So, the waiter earned 2 customers * $3 = $6 from the tipped customers

The final answer is: $6.</s>",6

1. Rachel scores 9 points for each treasure she finds.
2. She found 5 treasures on the first level.
3. She found 2 treasures on the second level.

To find her total score, we need to multiply the number of treasures she found on each level by the number of points she earns for each treasure, and then add the scores from both levels together.

First, let's find the score she earned on each level:

Score on first level = Number of treasures on first level * Points per treasure
= 5 treasures * 9 points/treasure
= 45 points

Score on second level = Number of treasures on second level * Points per treasure
= 2 treasures * 9 points/treasure
= 18 points

To find her total score, we add the scores from both levels:

Total score = Score on first level + Score on second level
= 45 points + 18 points
= 63 points

The waiter had 26 customers to begin with. He then added 27 more customers during the lunch rush. So the total number of customers he served is: 26 (initial) + 27 (added) = 53

Step 2: Determine how many customers didn't leave a tip.
It is given that 27 of the customers didn't leave a tip.

Step 3: Determine how many customers left a tip.
Since we know the waiter served 53 customers in total and 27 of them didn't leave a tip, to find out how many tipped we can subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers.
53 (total) - 27 (no tip) = 26

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The toy store had 17 giant stuffed bears in stock originally.
2. They received a shipment with 10 more bears.
3. They put the bears onto shelves with 9 bears on each shelf.

First, let's find out how many bears are on the shelves after they received the new shipment. We know there were 17 bears in stock and they added 10 bears from the new shipment:

17 (original bears) + 10 (new bears) = 27 bears

So, there are 27 bears on the shelves. We also know that there are 9 bears on each shelf:

Total number of bears = Number of bears on shelves
27 (total number of bears) = x (number of shelves) * 9 (number of bears per shelf)

To find the number of shelves, we'll divide the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf:

x = 27 / 9
x ≈ 3

However, we cannot have a fraction of a shelf. So, since there is a minimum of 1 shelf, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, we need:

x = 4 shelves (The final answer is)

For mystery books, Gwen wants 4 books on each of 5 shelves. So, the number of books on each mystery shelf is 4 * 5 = 20 books.
Total number of books on mystery shelves is 20 books/shelf * 5 shelves = 100 books.

For picture books, Gwen wants 4 books on each of 3 shelves. So, the number of books on each picture shelf is 4 * 3 = 12 books.
Total number of books on picture shelves is 12 books/shelf * 3 shelves = 36 books.

Step 2: Add the total number of books on mystery and picture shelves to find the total number of books Gwen has.
Total number of books = Total number of books on mystery shelves + Total number of books on picture shelves
Total number of books = 100 books + 36 books

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups of 9 the schools debate team can make with 5 boys and 40 girls, follow these steps:

1. First, let's find out the total number of students in the debate team. Since there are 5 boys and 40 girls, the total number of students is:
   Total students = Boys + Girls
   = 5 + 40
   = 45

2. Now, we want to find out how many groups of 9 students can be formed from this total number. To calculate the number of groups, divide the total number of students by the number of students in a group:
   Number of groups = Total students / Students per group
   = 45 / 9
   ≈ 5.1111

3. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a group, the answer should represent the number of complete groups formed. Therefore, we should find how many groups contain exactly 9 students and then round up (if possible) the remaining students to form a complete group. In this case, five complete groups of 9 students each can hold 45 students:
   5 groups * 9 students = 45 students

4. Since we have exactly 45 students, five complete groups of 9 students can be formed without any extra student remaining (although the last group may have fewer than 9 students).

                    :  A trivia team ? had 11 members total, ! but during a ! game , 6 members didn't ! show ? up. If ! each ? member that : did show ; up , scored 9 ? points, , how : many , points were scored ? total? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the number of team members who showed up.
We know that there were 11 team members in total and 6 did not show up. Therefore, the number of team members who showed up is:
11 members in total - 6 members absent = 5 team members

Step 2: Calculate the number of points scored by each team member who showed up.
We know that each team member who showed up scored 9 points. Therefore, the total number of points scored by the team members who showed up is:
Number of team members who showed up * Points scored per team member = 5 * 9 = 45 points

{The final answer is: 45 points were scored in total}</s>",45

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many cats the pet store had before the sale. We know that they had 13 Siamese cats and 5 house cats, so the total number of cats was:
13 (Siamese cats) + 5 (house cats) = 18 cats

Step 2: Next, we need to find out how many cats they sold during the sale. They sold 10 cats, so:
Number of cats sold = 10

Step 3: To find out how many cats are left, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats before the sale:
Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
Number of cats left = 18 (total cats) - 10 (cats sold)

Step 4: Therefore, the pet store has:

Megan baked 71 cupcakes. Todd ate 43 of them, so:
71 (total cupcakes) - 43 (cupcakes Todd ate) = 28 cupcakes are left

Step 2: Determine how many packages Megan can make with the remaining cupcakes.
She puts 7 cupcakes in each package, so:
28 (remaining cupcakes) / 7 (cupcakes per package) = approximately 4 packages

Step 2: Determine how many flowers are needed for one bouquet.
Each bouquet requires 8 flowers.

Step 3: Calculate how many bouquets can be made with the good flowers.
Number of bouquets = Number of good flowers / Flowers needed per bouquet
Number of bouquets = 56 / 8

                     Adam had 48 books. ! If ? he sold , 19 of them , and : used ; the ; money ? he earned to . buy , 38 new ; books, how many ! books : would Adam have? ; 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of books Adam had left after selling 19 books.
Adam started with 48 books. He sold 19 of them. Therefore, the number of books he had left is:
48 - 19 = 29 books

Step 2: Determine the number of books Adam bought with the money he earned from selling the 19 books.
Adam earned money from selling 19 books. He used this money to buy 38 new books. We'll first find out how much money he earned from selling 19 books, and then we'll calculate how many books he was able to buy with that amount.

First, let's find out how much money Adam earned from selling 19 books. The question doesn't provide specific information on the price of each book or the price Adam received for selling his books. So, we'll need to assume a value for this. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that each book sold for $5. Then the total amount of money Adam would have earned would be:
19 books * $5/book = $95

Now, let's see how many books Adam was able to buy with $95. Since each new book cost $X, we don't know the exact number of books Adam bought, but we can find a proportion:
$95 / $X = 38 books
To find X, we can cross-multiply:
$95 * X = $38 * 38
$95 * X = $1382.4
X = $1382.4 / $95
X = $14.36 (approximately)

Step 3: Find the total number of books Adam now has.
Initially, Adam had 29 books (from the ones he kept). He then bought 38 new books. So, the total number of books Adam now has is:
29 (initial books) + 38 (newly bought books) = 67 books

Each van can hold 5 people

Step 3: Determine how many vans are needed to transport all the people.
Number of vans = Total number of people / People per van
Number of vans = 15 / 5
Number of vans = 3

However, since they can only hire vans in whole numbers, they would need to round up and hire 4 vans to ensure everyone can go on the field trip.

Total sodas = 4 (regular) + 52 (diet) = 56

Next, we need to determine how many sodas can fit on one shelf. The problem states that each shelf can hold 7 sodas. So:

Sodas per shelf = 7

Now, we need to figure out how many shelves Tom would need to fill up all of his sodas. We can do this by dividing the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that each shelf can hold:

Shelves needed = Total sodas / Sodas per shelf
= 56 / 7

Since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, we must round up since Tom cannot store less than one shelf's worth of soda:

Shelves needed = ⌊56/7⌋ + 1
= 8 + 1 = 9 shelves

                 [/INST] To find out how many trips Luke will make to pick up trays from two tables, we first need to determine how many trays he can pick up in each trip. Given that Luke can carry 4 trays at a time, the number of trips needed to pick up trays from one table is:

Trips for one table = Total trays from one table / Trays carried per trip
 = 20 trays / 4 trays per trip
 = 5 trips

Similarly, the number of trips required to pick up trays from the other table is:

Trips for another table = Total trays from another table / Trays carried per trip
 = 16 trays / 4 trays per trip
 = 4 trips

Since Luke will be making trips from both tables, the total number of trips he will make is:

Total trips = Trips for one table + Trips for another table

Step 2: Determine the number of pies that can be made with the remaining apples.
Each pie takes 6 apples. The cafeteria has 54 apples left:
Number of pies that can be made = Total apples left / Apples per pie

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's find out how many brownies Tiffany baked in total for the party. From the problem statement, we know that she baked 8 brownies, but needed 17 for the party. Therefore, she had to bake an additional brownies for the party.

Total number of brownies Tiffany had to bake = Brownies she baked + Brownies she needed for the party
Total number of brownies = 8 + 17 = 25

Step 2: Next, we need to determine how much flour was used in making one brownie. The problem states that she used 8 cups of flour on each one, so:

Flour used per brownie = 8 cups

Step 3: Now we can calculate the total amount of flour that Tiffany used to bake all the brownies, including those for the party.

Total amount of flour used = Total number of brownies * Flour used per brownie
Total amount of flour used = 25 * 8 = 200 cups

Step 4: To find out how much flour Tiffany still needed for the party, we subtract the amount of flour she already used.

Total amount of flour Tiffany had = Total amount of flour used + Flour still needed
Total amount of flour Tiffany had = 200 + X

We know that 25 brownies were made, so:

Total amount of flour Tiffany had = 200 + X = 25 * 8
Total amount of flour Tiffany had = 200 + X = 200 + 16
Total amount of flour Tiffany had = 216

Now, let's solve for X:

Total amount of flour Tiffany had = 216
Total amount of flour Tiffany used = 200

                    :  Carol ? and : her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked , 29 ? and her : mother picked , 16. If only ? 38 ; of . the carrots ! were ? good, ! how ! many , bad carrots did . they have? : 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the given information.
Carol and her mom were picking carrots. Carol picked 29 carrots, and her mom picked 16 carrots.

Step 2: Identify the unknowns.
The problem asks for the number of bad carrots that Carol and her mom had.

Step 3: Solve for the total number of carrots picked.
Carol picked 29 carrots, and her mom picked 16 carrots. So, they picked a total of: 29 (Carol) + 16 (Mom) = <<29+16=45>>45 carrots.

Step 4: Determine the percentage of bad carrots.
""If only 38 out of 45"" of the carrots were good, it means the percentage of good carrots is 38/45 = 0.8488 or 84.88%. Converting this to a percentage of bad carrots: 100% – 84.88% = <<100-84.88=15.12>>15.12%.

Step 5: Find the number of bad carrots.
Since they picked 45 carrots, and 15.12% of those were bad carrots, the number of bad carrots is: 45 * 0.01512 = <<45*0.01512=0.6985>>0.7 or approximately 1 carrot. However, this answer is not provided in the options, which suggests that there might be an error in the given information or it might be an approximation of bad carrots.

Initially, there were 5 friends playing the video game. Then, 2 or more players joined. So the total number of players is:

5 friends + (Number of new players)

Step 2: Determine the number of new players
The problem doesn't explicitly provide the number of new players. However, it does give a hint that ""2 or more"" players joined. Since we cannot assume the minimum number, let's consider the maximum possibility, which would be if exactly 2 more players joined.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of players
Total number of players = Initial number of friends + Number of new players
Total number of players = 5 + 2 = 7

Step 4: Determine the number of lives per player
Each player has 8 lives.

Step 5: Calculate the total lives
Total lives = Number of players * Lives per player
Total lives = 7 players * 8 lives = 56 lives

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. Roger started with 25 books.
2. He sold 21 books, so we subtract 21 from the initial number to find out how many books Roger has left after selling some.
   {25 - 21 = 4}
3. Therefore, Roger has 4 books left after selling 21 books.
4. He used the money earned from selling the books to buy 30 new books. Let's find out how many books Roger has in total now.
5. First, we need to find the money earned from selling 21 books.
6. We don't have information about the selling price of each book, so let's assume that the price of one book is x dollars.
7. So, the money earned from selling 21 books would be 21*x.
8. With this money, Roger bought 30 new books.
9. To find the cost of 30 new books, we multiply the cost of one new book (x) by the total number of new books (30).
   {30*x}
10. The money left after buying the new books is the remaining money from the sale minus the cost of the new books.
11. Using the equation from step 7 and 9: 21*x = 30*x + 4*x
12. Solving the equation for x: x = 21/(1+1/3)
13. If we leave x as an expression, the equation doesn't tell us the exact number of books, but it tells us the ratio of the books Roger had initially to the books he has now.
14. The final answer depends on the value of x, and there isn't enough information to determine the exact number of books Roger has now. {The final answer is an expression for x.}</s>",34

Step 2: She lost 6 lives in a hard part of the game. So the number of lives Wendy has left is:
10 ( initial lives ) - 6 ( lives lost ) = 4 lives

Step 3: Next, it's mentioned that she would get 37 more lives for the next level. So, the total number of lives Wendy will have after getting the additional lives is:

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The school's baseball team had 48 new players and 6 returning players.
2. The coach wants to put the players into groups with 6 players in each group.

To find out how many groups there would be in total, we first need to determine the total number of players. We know that there are 48 new players and 6 returning players, so:
Total players = New players + Returning players
Total players = 48 + 6
Total players = 54

Now, we can find the number of groups by dividing the total number of players by the number of players in each group:
Groups = Total players / Players per group
Groups = 54 / 6

To get an exact answer, we can continue the division:
Groups = 9.0 ≈ 9

However, since there cannot be a fraction of a group, we round this down to the nearest whole number.

1. Nancy initially had 80 files on her computer.

3. Nancy then put the rest of the files into folders.
4. There were 7 files in each folder.
5. To find out how many folders Nancy ended up with, we need to divide the number of files she had left by the number of files in each folder: 

{The final answer is: 49 files / 7 files/folder = approximately 7 folders}

It is important to note that due to rounding, the actual number of folders may be slightly different than 7. In practice, you'd use integer division or round up to ensure having a proper number of folders for those last few files.

1. Luke started with 39 games.
2. He sold 19 games, so he had 39 - 19 = <<39-19=18>>18 games left.
3. Luke packed the rest of the games into boxes, putting 4 games into each box.

To find out how many boxes he needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:

{The number of boxes needed is 18 games / 4 games per box = <<18/4=4.5>>4.5 boxes. Since we can't have half a box, we need to round up to the next whole number.}

3. The rest of the students, which is 48 students, were put into 8 groups.
   - To find out how many students are in each group, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups:

1. Isabel uploaded a total of 25 pictures to Facebook.
2. She put 10 pictures into one album. So, the number of pictures in the first album is 10.
3. The rest of the pictures (25 - 10) were distributed among 5 different albums.
4. To find the number of pictures in each of the remaining 5 albums, we first find the total number of pictures in all albums except the first one. Since there are 5 albums with this unknown number of pictures in each and one album with 10 pictures, there are a total of 6 albums with 25 pictures in them. So, the total number of pictures in all albums except the first one is 25 - 10 = 15. This total is then divided by the number of albums (5) to find the number of pictures in each of the remaining albums.

The final answer is: {Each of the remaining 5 albums contains 15 / 5 = 3 pictures}. So, Isabel put 10 pictures into one album and 3 pictures into each of the other 5 albums. Therefore, the total number of pictures in all her albums is 10 + 5*3 = 10+15 = 25 pictures.</s>",3

Mike earns a total of $14.14 from mowing lawns and $26 from weed eating. If he spends $5 a week, how long will the money last him?

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Mike has.
Mike earns $14.14 from mowing lawns and $26 from weed eating. Therefore, Mike's total earnings are:

Total earnings = $14.14 (mowing lawns) + $26 (weed eating)
Total earnings = $30.14

Step 3: Determine how long the money will last if Mike spends $5 a week.

To find out how long the money will last, we need to divide the total earnings by the weekly spending amount.

Total earnings = $30.14
Weekly spending = $5

Weeks until money runs out = Total earnings / Weekly spending
Weeks until money runs out = $30.14 / $5

Step 4: Calculate the number of weeks the money will last.
Weeks until money runs out ≈ 6.027 weeks

Since we cannot have a fraction of a week, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Weeks until money runs out = 6 weeks

The problem states that Dave had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts. So, the total number of shirts is 9 (short sleeve) + 27 (long sleeve) = <ins>36 shirts</ins>.

Step 2: Determine how many shirts Dave washed before school started.
The problem states that he washed 20 shirts before school started.

Step 3: Find out how many shirts Dave didn't wash.
To find out how many shirts Dave didn't wash, we subtract the number of shirts he did wash from the total number of shirts he had to wash. So, 36 (total shirts) - 20 (shirts washed) = <ins>16 shirts</ins> that he didn't wash.

                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many potatoes the chef still needs to cook.So, we subtract the number of potatoes he's already cooked from the total number of potatoes he needs to cook:

Potatoes to cook = Total potatoes - Already cooked potatoes
= 9 - 7
= 2 potatoes

Next, we need to determine how long it takes to cook one potato, and then find out how long it will take to cook the remaining 2 potatoes.

We know that it takes 3 minutes to cook one potato.

To cook 2 potatoes, it will take twice the time it takes to cook one potato:

Time to cook 2 potatoes = 2 * Time to cook 1 potato
= 2 * 3 minutes
= 6 minutes

Therefore, the chef will need to cook the remaining 2 potatoes for 6 minutes.

                 [/INST] Step 1: find the total number of puppies in the shelter.
The pet shelter had 2 puppies originally, and then 34 more were brought in. So, the total number of puppies is 2 (originally) + 34 (newly brought in) = 36 puppies.

Step 2: find how many puppies will be adopted per day
It is mentioned that 4 puppies are adopted per day.

Step 3: find how long it will take for all puppies to be adopted
To find this, divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day. So, 36 (total puppies) / 4 (puppies adopted per day) = 9 days. Therefore, it would take 9 days for all of the puppies to be adopted. {The final answer is 9 days}.</s>",9

                    question:
                     , Will had 59 , pieces : of ; clothing ? to wash. . He , put 32 of ? them in one load, but : decided ; to . split the . rest into ! 9 equal ? loads. How many pieces of : clothing could ! go in , each ; of the ; small , loads? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in one small load, we first need to determine the number of pieces in the remaining loads after the first large load.

Will put 32 pieces in one large load, so the number of pieces in the remaining loads is:
59 (total pieces) - 32 (pieces in large load) = 27 pieces

He decided to split the remaining pieces into 9 equal loads. So, the number of pieces in each small load is:
27 pieces (remaining pieces) / 9 (loads) = ≈ 3 pieces/load (with a remainder)

However, since the question asks for an exact number, we cannot divide by 3 directly. Instead, we need to find a multiple of 3 that is close to 27 and divide that by 3 to get the number of pieces for one small load.

A multiple of 3 close to 27 is 27 itself (as it's already a multiple of 3), but it's not an exact multiple since there's a remainder when we divide the total pieces by the number of loads. So, we'll look for another multiple of 3 that can accommodate this remainder.

We can add one more piece to make the number a multiple of 3 (30), and then divide by 3 to find the number of pieces in one small load:

Number of pieces in one small load = Total pieces in the remaining loads / Number of loads = 30 pieces / 9 loads = ≈ 3.33 pieces/load

Since we cannot have a fraction of a piece of clothing, we need to round up 3.33 to the next whole number, so that each small load has enough pieces for washing.

Therefore, we can put approximately 4 pieces of clothing in each small load. {The final answer is: The small loads could hold around 4 pieces of clothing each}.

It's important to note that this solution assumes that all clothes can be washed together in one load without any restrictions. In reality, different types of clothing may have washing requirements that necessitate separate loads, creating different load sizes.</s>",3

                    ?  ? Nancy : was ? organizing , her book ! case making sure : each of : the shelves had . exactly 6 books on : it. If she ! had 2 shelves ? of mystery books ? and ! 6 shelves ; of picture books, . how : many . books did . she ; have total? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many books Nancy had in total, we need to calculate the number of books on each type of shelf and add them together. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Nancy organizes her book cases. Each shelf must have exactly 6 books.
2. She has 2 shelves for mystery books and 6 shelves for picture books.

First, let's calculate the number of books on each type of shelf:

Mystery books shelves:
- Each shelf has exactly 6 books.
- She has 2 mystery books shelves.

Number of books on mystery books shelves = Shelves * Books per shelf
= 2 * 6
= 12 books

Picture books shelves:
- Each shelf has exactly 6 books.
- She has 6 picture books shelves.

Number of books on picture books shelves = Shelves * Books per shelf
= 6 * 6
= 36 books

Next, let's add the number of books on both types of shelves to find the total number of books Nancy has:

Total number of books = Mystery books + Picture books
= 12 + 36
= 48 books

So, {The final answer is 48 books}. Nancy had 48 books in total when organizing her book case with 6 books on each shelf for mystery books and picture books.</s>",48

                 [/INST] To find out how many 5-dollar toys Paul can buy after receiving an additional 7 dollars for his allowance, follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of money Paul has after receiving his allowance.
Paul started with $3 and received an additional $7, so {The total amount of money Paul has is $3 + $7 = $10}.

2. Determine how many 5-dollar toys Paul can buy with this amount.
{Since Paul has $10 and each toy costs $5, he can buy $10 / $5 = 2 toys}. However, since we were asked for the number of toys Paul can buy with the new amount, not the leftover amount, the final answer is:
{The final answer is: Paul can buy 2 toys with his newly received allowance}.

Note that Paul started with $3 and bought some toys, then received an additional $7. But we calculated Paul's purchasing power with his entire new amount, not accounting for the toys he already bought. The final answer assumes that Paul uses his entire new allowance for buying toys.</s>",2

- Wendy is playing a video game.
- She had 43 lives initially.
- In a hard part of the game, she lost 8 lives.
- She gained 39 more lives in the next level.

Step 2: Calculate the number of lives Wendy has after losing 8 lives and gaining 39 more lives
Lives before losing 8 lives = 43
Lives lost = 8
Lives gained = 39
Total lives after the level change = Initial lives - Lives lost + Lives gained
= 43 - 8 + 39

Step 3: Calculate the total number of lives Wendy has
Total lives = 43 - 8 + 39

1. Katie had 85 files on her computer.
2. She deleted 40 files, leaving her with 45 files.
3. Katie put the remaining files into folders, with 5 files in each one.
4. To find out how many folders Katie ended up with, we divide the number of files she kept by the number of files per folder:
   {Number of folders = Total files kept ÷ Files per folder}
5. Plugging in the numbers:
   {Number of folders = 45 ÷ 5}
6. The result of this division is 9. However, since one folder is allocated for the files and another for the folder name, we need to add one more folder.
7. Therefore, the final answer is:

                 [/INST] To find out how much money Will made in two days, we need to calculate his earnings for each day and then add them together. Here are the steps:

1. First, let's find out how much Will earned on each day based on the number of hours he worked and his hourly wage.
   - On Monday: Hours worked = 8, Hourly wage = $8
     Money earned on Monday = Hours worked * Hourly wage
     Money earned on Monday = 8 hours * $8/hour
     Money earned on Monday = $64

   - On Tuesday: Hours worked = 2, Hourly wage = $8
     Money earned on Tuesday = Hours worked * Hourly wage
     Money earned on Tuesday = 2 hours * $8/hour
     Money earned on Tuesday = $16

2. Now we can find the total amount of money Will made in two days by adding the money he earned on each day.
   Total money earned = Money earned on Monday + Money earned on Tuesday
   Total money earned = $64 + $16
   Total money earned = $80

2. She sold 6 Dozens of cupcakes. So she sold 6 Dozens * 12 Cupcakes/Dozen = 72 Cupcakes.
3. She then baked 27 More Cupcakes, which is just an additional 27 Cupcakes.

Therefore, the total number of cupcakes Carol had is 228 (initially made) + 72 (sold) + 27 (baked) = 327 Cupcakes.

- Oliver is helping to put away books at the library.
- There are 46 books to be put away in total.
- A librarian takes 10 books away.
- Oliver is left with the remaining books.
- Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf.

Step 2: Solve for the number of books Oliver is left with
- The total number of books is 46.
- The librarian took 10 books away.
- Therefore, Oliver is left with: 46 (total books) - 10 (books taken away) = 36 books.
{The librarian leaves Oliver with 36 books}.

Step 3: Determine the number of shelves needed
- Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf.
- To find the number of shelves needed, divide the total number of books left by the number of books that can fit on one shelf: 36 (books) / 4 (books per shelf).
{The final answer is: 9.5 shelves}.

However, the answer 9.5 shelves doesn't make sense in this context because you can't have half a shelf.

Step 1: Find the number of parrots and parakeets in one cage.
Each cage has 8 parrots, so the number of parrots in one cage is 8.
Each cage also has 2 parakeets, so the number of parakeets in one cage is 2.

Step 2: Find the total number of birds in one cage.
The number of birds in one cage is the number of parrots plus the number of parakeets.
Total birds in one cage = Parrots + Parakeets
Total birds in one cage = 8 + 2
Total birds in one cage = 10

Step 3: Find the total number of birds in all the cages.
There are 4 cages in the pet store, so the total number of birds in the pet store is the number of birds in one cage multiplied by the number of cages.

We have 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:
5 chocolate chip cookies + 19 oatmeal cookies = 24 cookies

Step 2: Determine how many cookies are in each bag.
Each bag contains 8 cookies.

Step 3: Determine how many bags can be made with the total number of cookies.
To find out how many bags can be made, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per bag:

                 [/INST] To find the total number of books Bianca has, we first need to find out how many books are on each type of shelf, and then multiply that by the number of shelves for each type.

1. We know that each shelf (mystery or picture books) has exactly 8 books.
2. Bianca has 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books.

First, we'll calculate the number of books on mystery bookshelves:
    Number of mystery books = Number of mystery shelves * Books per shelf
    = 5 shelves * 8 books/shelf
    = 40 books

Next, we'll calculate the number of books on picture bookshelves:
    Number of picture books = Number of picture shelves * Books per shelf
    = 4 shelves * 8 books/shelf
    = 32 books

Finally, we add the number of mystery books and picture books to find the total number of books:
    Total number of books = Mystery books + Picture books
    = 40 books + 32 books

                    question:
                     . John ! was ! organizing his : baseball cards in a binder . with , 3 . on ! each page. If ! he had ! 8 new , cards ? and 16 old cards : to ? put , in : the binder, how many pages : would , he use? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many pages John would need to add to his binder to accommodate his new and old cards, we first need to determine how many cards can be stored on each page and then calculate how many pages he currently has and how many more pages he will need.

Step 1: Determine the number of cards per page.
John has 3 rows of cards on each page, and assuming each row can hold a certain number 'r' of cards, we can find the number of cards per page as follows:

cards per page = rows per page * cards per row

Step 2: Find the number of cards per row.
The problem doesn't give us a specific number for cards per row, so let's assume that each card is about the size of a typical business card, which is 2 inches × 3.5 inches, and that a single page in the binder is about A5-size (14.84 inches × 10.5 inches). Let's calculate the approximate number of cards that can fit on a row:

cards per row = (width of a page) / (width of a card)

Step 3: Calculate the number of cards per page.
Assuming a row fits 10 cards across, as calculated above:

cards per page = rows per page * cards per row
cards per page = 3 rows * 10 cards / row
cards per page = 30 cards

Step 4: Determine how many pages John currently has.
John hasn't given us a number for the total number of cards he currently has. Let's denote the number of old cards as 'o' and the number of new cards as 'n':

1. We know that John has old cards. So, the number of pages he already has is the number of pages filled with old cards:
pages = old cards / cards per page

Step 5: Find the number of pages needed for the new cards.
1. Calculate the number of pages needed for the new cards:
new pages = new cards / cards per page

Step 6: Calculate the total number of pages needed.
1. To find the total number of pages needed, add the number of pages for the old cards and the number of pages for the new cards:
total pages = old pages + new pages

Step 7: Find the actual number of pages needed for new cards.
First, let's calculate the number of old cards:

old cards = old cards per page * old pages
old cards = cards per page * pages
old cards = 30 cards * pages

Now, we know that John has 8 new cards and 16 old cards:

total cards = old cards + new cards
total cards = (30 cards * pages) + 8 new cards + 16 old cards

We want to find the value of 'pages' that satisfies this equation. Let's assume an initial value for 'pages' and adjust it iteratively as needed:

pages = (total cards / cards per page).

Keep adjusting 'pages' until the total number of cards is close to the given 8 new cards + 16 old cards.

The final answer is:
{The final answer is a value of 'pages' that satisfies the equation total cards = (30 cards * pages) + 8 new cards + 16 old cards with an approximation of the total cards being equal to 24.}

{Note: The calculation might not yield a precise integer value for 'pages', and it may require estimating the number of old cards or the card density on the binder pages to arrive at a reasonable solution.}</s>",8

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of brownies Isabel needs for her party.
Isabel baked 3 brownies, but she needed 5 for her party. This means she is missing 2 brownies.

Step 2: Determine the amount of flour used for one brownie.
Isabel used 5 cups of flour on each brownie.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of flour Isabel has used.
Isabel baked 3 brownies, each using 5 cups of flour. So, she has used 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 cups of flour.

Step 4: Determine the amount of flour she still needs.
Isabel needs 5 brownies in total, so she still needs to make 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 brownies. Since she uses 5 cups of flour for each brownie, she still needs 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 cups of flour.

Step 2: Tom spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth.
 - The number of tickets Tom spent at the 'dunk a clown' booth is given as 28.

Step 3: Tom used the remaining tickets on rides.
 - The number of tickets Tom used on rides is the total number of tickets he bought minus the number of tickets he spent at the 'dunk a clown' booth.

Step 4: Each ride costs 4 tickets.
 - The cost of each ride is given as 4 tickets.

Step 5: Calculate the number of rides Tom can go on.
 - To find the number of rides Tom can go on, divide the number of tickets he used on rides by the cost of each ride.

Step 6: Perform the calculation.
 - Number of rides = Number of tickets used on rides / Cost of each ride
 - Number of rides = (40 (the total number of tickets Tom bought) - 28 (the number of tickets Tom spent at the 'dunk a clown' booth)) / 4 (cost of each ride)

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many customers stayed after some left.
The number of customers who left was 14. So, the number of customers who stayed is the total number of customers minus those who left: 22 (total customers) - 14 (customers who left) = {18 customers} stayed.

Step 2: Determine the total number of people at the tables where the customers sat.
Since the remaining customers stayed at the tables, and there were 4 people at each table, the total number of people at the tables is the number of customers who stayed multiplied by the people per table: 18 customers × 4 people/table = {72 people}.

Step 3: Calculate the number of tables.
To find the number of tables, divide the total number of people (72) by the number of people per table (4): 72 people ÷ 4 people/table = {18 tables}.

Therefore, the waiter had {18 tables} in his section.</s>",2

1. Roger puts 48 pieces of clothing in one load.
2. He decides to split the remaining clothing into 9 equal loads.
3. First, let's find out how many pieces of clothing are in the remaining loads. Since there are 9 small loads and 1 large load, there are 10 loads in total: 1 large load + 9 small loads.
4. Since the large load contains 48 pieces of clothing, we can find the number of pieces in one small load by dividing the total number of pieces by the number of loads, both large and small: Total pieces / Number of loads = Pieces per load
5. Total pieces = 120 pieces
6. Number of loads = 10 loads
7. So, Pieces per load = 120 pieces / 10 loads = 12 pieces

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups the schools debate team could make with 26 boys and 46 girls when they are split into groups of 9, follow these steps:

1. First, let's find the total number of students in the debate team: 26 boys + 46 girls = 72 students.
2. Next, let's find out how many groups can be made with a group size of 9: total students / students per group = 72 / 9.
3. By performing this division: 72 ÷ 9 ≈ 8

However, we can't have a fraction of a group. Since we have 2 extra students, we can't form exactly 8 groups. Instead, we can form 7 complete groups, and the remaining 2 students will be in an additional, incomplete group.

So, the final answer is: {The final answer is 7 complete groups and 1 incomplete group, for a total of 8 groups} or simply, 8 groups.

Keep in mind that the answer with 7 complete groups and 1 incomplete group is more accurate since we originally had 72 students, and only 63 students fit exactly into 7 groups of 9. The extra students make one more group.</s>",8

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of apples ordered for the students.
The cafeteria ordered 6 red apples for each student, so for x students, they ordered 6x red apples. They also ordered 15 green apples for each student, so for x students, they ordered 15x green apples.

Total number of apples ordered = Red apples ordered + Green apples ordered
= 6x + 15x
= 21x

Step 2: Determine the number of apples needed for the students who wanted fruit.
Five students wanted fruit, so the cafeteria needed to provide apples for 5 students.

Number of apples for 5 students = Red apples per student * Number of students
= 6 * 5
= 30 red apples

Step 3: Determine the number of extra apples the cafeteria had.
The cafeteria ordered a total of 21x apples, but only needed 30 red apples for the students who wanted fruit.

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples for students wanting fruit
= 21x - 30

The final answer is: 21x - 30 extra apples. However, the value of x is not given in the problem, so this answer is not yet complete. To find the actual number of extra apples, we need to know the exact number of students.</s>",16

Total number of people = Managers + Employees
Total number of people = 9 managers + 15 employees
Total number of people = 9 + 15 = 24

Step 2: Determine how many people will be in each team.
Number of teams = Total number of people / People per team
Number of teams = 24 / 8
Number of teams = 3

However, since it's not possible to divide the total number of people into teams of exactly 8, we need to adjust the team size.

Step 3: Calculate the new team size.
New team size = Total number of people / Number of teams
New team size = 24 / 3
New team size = 8 (approximately)(1)

However, since they can't have a team with exactly one less member, they can add one more person to each team to get teams of size 9.

Step 4: Calculate the number of people in each team with the adjusted team size.
Number of people per team = New team size + 1
Number of people per team = 8 + 1
Number of people per team = 9

So, each team will have approximately 9 people, with an adjustment to make each team have a full roster.

{The final answer is: Each team will have approximately 9 people.}

(1) In a real-world scenario, the team size might be rounded up or down to accommodate the total number of attendees. However, for the purposes of this calculation, we'll assume that teams of size 9 can be formed.</s>",3

Next, since each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, we can calculate how long it took him to cook the potatoes he has already cooked.

We know that there are 5 potatoes he has already cooked, so:

Time for cooked potatoes = Number of potatoes * Time per potato
= 5 potatoes * 6 minutes/potato

Now, we can determine how long it will take him to cook the remaining 13 potatoes.

Time for remaining potatoes = Number of remaining potatoes * Time per potato
= 13 potatoes * 6 minutes/potato

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the given information.
Paige had 43 math problems and 12 ! science problems for homework. She finished 44 problems at school.

Step 2: Identify the unknown.
The number of math and science problems Paige has to do for homework is unknown.

Step 3: Find the total number of problems Paige has.
The total number of problems Paige has for homework is 43 (math) + 12 ! (science) = 55 ! problems.

Step 4: Determine the number of problems Paige finished at school.
Paige finished 44 problems at school, but we don't know if these were math or science problems.

Step 5: Divide the total number of homework problems by 2 to find the number of problems in each category.
Since there are 2 types of problems (math and science), we can divide the total number of problems by 2 to find how many problems are in each category: 55 ! problems / 2 = 27.5 ! problems. However, since Paige cannot have half a problem, this means there is a mistake in the given information or there are additional details not provided.

Step 6: Solve the problem with given information.
To find the number of problems Paige has left for homework, we need to subtract the number of problems she finished at school from the total number of problems: 55 ! problems - 44 ! problems = 11 ! problems. However, since we don't know how many of these 11 problems are math and how many are science, we cannot clearly determine the final answer.

Based on the given information, it seems there is a mistake or an incomplete detail. The final answer is not able to be determined as provided.</s>",11

April's discount florist had a sale where each flower was $8. Vanessa bought 3 roses and 3 daisies.

Step 2: Find the cost of roses and daisies separately.
Cost of roses = Number of roses * Cost of each rose
Cost of roses = 3 * $8
Cost of roses = $24

Cost of daisies = Number of daisies * Cost of each daisy
Cost of daisies = 3 * $8
Cost of daisies = $24

Step 3: Find the total amount spent by Vanessa.
Total amount spent = Cost of roses + Cost of daisies
Total amount spent = $24 + $24
Total amount spent = $48

Total pictures = Pictures from phone + Pictures from camera
Total pictures = 5 + 35
Total pictures = 40

Step 2: Now, we know that Olivia wants to sort her pictures into 8 different albums, each with the same number of pictures. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we simply divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:
Number of pictures in each album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Number of pictures in each album = 40 / 8
Number of pictures in each album = 5

Step 2: To find out how many baggies Robin can make with all the cookies, we first need to determine how many baggies she can make with the chocolate chip cookies and then add the baggies made from the oatmeal cookies.

Step 3: Robin has 23 chocolate chip cookies. So, she can make:
number_of_chocolate_chip_bagges = number_of_cookies / cookies_per_bag
number_of_chocolate_chip_bagges = 23 / 6
number_of_chocolate_chip_bagges ≈ 3.83333333333
Since she cannot make a fraction of a bag, she can make only 3 baggies with chocolate chip cookies.

Step 4: Robin has 25 oatmeal cookies. So, she can make:
number_of_oatmeal_bagges = number_of_cookies / cookies_per_bag
number_of_oatmeal_bagges = 25 / 6
number_of_oatmeal_bagges ≈ 4.16666666667
Since she cannot make a fraction of a bag, she can make only 4 baggies with oatmeal cookies.

Step 5: To find the total number of baggies Robin can make, we add the number of baggies she made with chocolate chip cookies and the number of baggies she made with oatmeal cookies.

In this problem, we're given that Cody started with $45 for his birthday, then received an additional $9, but spent $19 on a new game. We need to find out how much money Cody has left.

Step 2: Calculating the amount Cody had after receiving the additional dollars
Cody started with $45 and then received $9, so the total amount of money he had after receiving his birthday gift is:
$45 + $9 = $54

Step 3: Subtracting the cost of the new game from the total amount of money
Cody spent $19 on the new game. To find out how much money he has left after spending on the game, we need to subtract the cost of the game from the total amount of money he had after receiving his birthday gift:
$54 - $19 = $35

Step 1:
1. Wendy uploaded 22 pictures from her phone.
2. Wendy uploaded 2 pictures from her camera.

Total pictures = Pictures from phone + Pictures from camera
Total pictures = 22 + 2
Total pictures = 24

Step 2:
Since Wendy wants to sort her pictures into 4 different albums, each containing an equal number of pictures, we need to find out how many pictures are in each album.

To determine the number of pictures in one album, we can divide the total number of pictures by 4.

Number of pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Number of pictures per album = 24 / 4
Number of pictures per album = 6

So, Wendy will have 6 pictures in each of the 4 different albums.

Total pieces = Katie's pieces + Sister's pieces
Total pieces = 8 + 23
Total pieces = 31

Step 2: They ate 8 pieces the first night. To find out how many pieces they have left, we simply subtract the number of pieces they ate from the total number of pieces they had:

Leftover pieces = Total pieces - Eaten pieces
Leftover pieces = 31 - 8
Leftover pieces = 23

Step 1: Find out how many puppies are still at the pet store.
88 puppies (initial number) - 34 puppies (sold) = 54 puppies (remaining)

Step 2: Find out how many puppies fit in one cage.
6 puppies (per cage)

Step 3: Find out how many cages are needed to hold the remaining puppies.
54 puppies (remaining) / 6 puppies (per cage) = 9 cages (with one puppy left over)

Since the problem asks for the number of cages used and not the number of empty spaces, we'll round up to the nearest whole number and add one more cage to accommodate the extra puppy:

1. Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time.
2. From the first table, he needs to pick up 9 trays.
3. From the second table, he needs to pick up 7 trays.

To determine the number of trips Jerry needs to make, we need to find out how many trays he will carry in total and then divide that by the number of trays he can carry in one trip:

First, let's find out how many trays Jerry will need to carry in total:

Trays from the first table = 9
Trays from the second table = 7

Total number of trays = Trays from table 1 + Trays from table 2
Total number of trays = 9 + 7 = 16

Now, let's find out how many trips Jerry will make to pick up all these trays:

Trips = Total number of trays / Trays per trip

Trips = 16 / 8
Trips = 2 with a remainder of 0

Since Jerry can't make a fraction of a trip, he needs to make 2 full trips to pick up all the trays.

- second level: the subsequent stage or part of the game

Variables with given values:
- She finds 2 treasures on the first level
- She finds 6 treasures on the second level

Step 2: Determine the relationship between treasures found and points scored.
According to the problem statement, Faye scores 7 points for each treasure she finds.

Step 3: Calculate the points earned on the first and second levels.
Points earned on the first level = Treasures found on the first level × Points per treasure
                                            = 2 ×7
                                            = 14

Points earned on the second level = Treasures found on the second level × Points per treasure

Total number of players = New players + Returning players
Total number of players = 12 + 44

Next, we divide the total number of players by the desired number of players per group to find out how many groups the coach can form.

Number of groups = Total number of players / Players per group
Number of groups = 56 / 8

Number of groups is not a whole number, which is not possible in this scenario as we cannot have a fraction of a group. The coach can only form groups of 8 players without any remaining players.

In order to find an answer, we either need to have a total number of players that is a multiple of 8, or adjust the number of players per group to fit the total number of players. For example, we could form groups of 7 and one group of 6, but that's not specified in the given problem.

Total money = Initial amount + Money received for birthday

Step 3: We are given that Roger received an extra $28 for his birthday, so we can calculate his total amount of money as:

Total money = $16 + $28
Total money = $44

Step 4: Next, Roger spent $25 on a new game. To find out how much money Roger has left, we subtract the amount he spent on the game from his total money.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many bags Sam filled on each day.
- On Saturday, he filled 3 bags.
- On Sunday, he filled 4 more bags than he filled on Saturday. So, on Sunday, he filled 3 + 4 = 7 bags.

Step 2: Calculate the number of bags Sam filled in total.
- He filled 3 bags on Saturday.
- He filled 7 bags on Sunday.
- Therefore, he filled a total of 3 (on Saturday) + 7 (on Sunday) = 10 bags.

Step 3: Find out how many cans were in each bag.
- Each bag had 9 cans.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of cans Sam collected.
- He filled 10 bags, and each bag had 9 cans.
- So, he picked up a total of 10 (number of bags) × 9 (number of cans per bag) = 90 cans.

 April's Discount Flowers is having a sale where each flower is $3. Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies.

 Step 2: Find the cost of roses.
 Emily bought 2 roses, and each rose costs $3. So, the cost of roses = 2 * $3 = $6.

 Step 3: Find the cost of daisies.
 Emily bought 2 daisies, and each daisy costs $3. So, the cost of daisies = 2 * $3 = $6.

 Step 4: Find the total amount spent by Emily.
 The cost of roses = $6.
 The cost of daisies = $6.
 So, the total amount spent = $6 (for roses) + $6 (for daisies) = $12.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of puppies left after selling 7.
The pet store had 13 puppies, and they sold 7 of them. So, the number of puppies remaining is:
13 (original number of puppies) - 7 (number sold) = 6

Step 2: Calculate the number of puppies in each cage.
Each cage can hold 2 puppies.

Step 3: Determine how many cages are needed to hold the remaining puppies.
Number of cages = Number of remaining puppies / Number of puppies per cage
Number of cages = 6 (remaining puppies) / 2 (puppies per cage) = 3

However, this answer is incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the problem. The question states that the pet store put the ""rest"" of the puppies into cages with 2 in each. The mistake was made by assuming that all remaining puppies were placed in one cage.

To find the correct answer, we must recognize that the pet store placed the remaining puppies into cages, each with 2 puppies, which means they needed:

Step 4: Recalculate the number of cages needed to accommodate all the remaining puppies.
Number of cages = Number of remaining puppies / Number of puppies per cage
Number of cages = 6 (remaining puppies) / 2 (puppies per cage) = 3 cages (each with 2 puppies).

Therefore, the final answer is:

Step 2: Determine the number of flowers used in each bouquet. We know each bouquet had 8 : flowers.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bouquets Isabel could make originally. Divide the total number of flowers she picked by the number of flowers in each bouquet: 66 : flowers / 8 : flowers/bouquet = 8.25 bouquets. Since she can't make a fraction of a bouquet, she could make 8 bouquets originally.

Step 4: Determine the number of bouquets affected by the wilted flowers. We know 10 bouquets wilted.

Step 5: Calculate the number of bouquets Isabel can still make. Subtract the number of wilted bouquets from the original number of bouquets she could make: 8 bouquets - 10 wilted bouquets = -2 bouquets. Since it's not possible to make a negative number of bouquets, the question has an inconsistency. It's not possible for Isabel to make the stated number of flowers into the stated number of bouquets while also having 10 bouquets wilt. Please check the numbers given in the problem for accuracy.

                 [/INST] To find out how many tickets Oliver used at the carnival, we need to calculate the number of tickets he bought for each type of ride and then add them together.

1. Tickets for the Ferris wheel: Oliver rode the Ferris wheel 5 times, and each ride cost 7 tickets.
   Number of tickets for Ferris wheel = Rides on Ferris wheel × Cost of each Ferris wheel ride
   = 5 × 7
   = 35 tickets

2. Tickets for the bumper cars: Oliver rode the bumper cars 4 times, and each ride cost 7 tickets.
   Number of tickets for bumper cars = Rides on bumper cars × Cost of each bumper cars ride
   = 4 × 7
   = 28 tickets

Now, we need to find out the total number of tickets Oliver used. We can do this by adding the number of tickets he bought for each ride type.

Total tickets used = Tickets for Ferris wheel + Tickets for bumper cars
                          = 35 + 28

Total number of furniture = Chairs + Tables
 Total number of furniture = 4 + 4
 Total number of furniture = 8

Next, we know that it took her 6 minutes to put together one piece of furniture.

So, to find out how many minutes it took for her to put together all the furniture, we need to multiply the number of pieces of furniture by the number of minutes it takes to put together one piece.

To find out how many points Carol had at the end of the game, we need to subtract the points she lost in the last round from the total points she had after the first two rounds:

1. Total points after the first two rounds: 17 points (Round 1) + 6 points (Round 2) = 23 points
2. Points lost in the last round: -16 points

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's determine how many apples were given out to students for lunch. We know that 50 apples were initially available and 5 apples were handed out to each student.

5 apples/student * Number of students = Total apples given out for lunch
5 apples/student * Number of students = 50 apples
Number of students = 10 students

Step 2: Next, let's find out how many apples were used to make pies. We know that the remaining apples after lunch were used to make pies and each pie takes 5 apples.

Total apples = Initial apples + Apples for lunch + Apples for pies
50 apples = 50 apples + 5 apples/student * Number of students + 5 apples/pie * Number of pies

Subtracting the apples for lunch and apples used to make pies from the initial number of apples yields:

Initial apples = 50 apples - 5 apples/student * Number of students - 5 apples/pie * Number of pies
50 apples = 50 apples - 5 apples/student * 10 students - 5 apples/pie * Number of pies

Step 3: Setting up the equation to solve for the number of pies:

50 apples = 5 apples/student * 10 students - 5 apples/pie * Number of pies

5 apples/pie * Number of pies = 50 apples - 5 apples/student * 10 students

Number of pies = (50 apples - 5 apples/student * 10 students) / 5 apples/pie

Number of pies = (50 - 50) / 5
Number of pies = 0 / 5

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the given information.
- Oliver had 33 dollars in January.
- He spent 4 dollars by March.

Step 2: Find the amount of money Oliver has in March before getting more money from his mom.
- Oliver started with 33 dollars in January.
- He spent 4 dollars by March, so the amount of money Oliver has before getting more money is: 33 - 4 = <=this is an inequation because we don't know the exact value of the 'dollars' sign>=29 dollars.

Step 3: Find the new amount of money Oliver will have after getting 32 dollars from his mom.
- Oliver gets 32 dollars from his mom.
- The new amount of money Oliver will have = Old amount + Money received from mom = 29 + 32 = 61 dollars.

The final answer is: Oliver will have 61 dollars.</s>",61

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understanding the problem
The Applewood school cafeteria had 14.1 apples. They used 13 apples to make lunches for the students, so they have 14.1 - 13 = <<14.1-13=1.1>>1.1 apples left. After that, they bought 49 more apples.

Step 2: Calculate the initial number of apples after using some for lunches
Initial apples = 14.1 + 49
Initial apples = 14.1 + 49 = <<14.1+49=63.1>>63.1

Step 3: Rounding up the initial number of apples (since we started with 14.1 apples)
Since we cannot have a fraction of an apple, we round up to the nearest whole number:
Initial apples (rounded) = 64

Step 4: Finding the final answer
{The final answer is:} The school cafeteria would have 64 apples.</s>",50

                 [/INST] To find Frank's final score, we first need to determine how many questions he answered correctly in each half of the game. The problem states that Frank answered 3 questions correctly in the first half and 2 questions correctly in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the number of points Frank earned in each half:

First half:
Number of correct answers: 3
Points earned: 3 questions * 3 points/question = 9 points

Second half:
Number of correct answers: 2
Points earned: 2 questions * 3 points/question = 6 points

To find Frank's final score, we just need to add the number of points he earned in each half:

Final score: Points in first half + Points in second half = 9 points + 6 points = {The final answer is: 15 points}</s>",15

                 [/INST] Step 1: We are given that Zoe found 8 boxes of winter clothing.

Step 2: Inside each box, there are 4 scarves. So, we have a total of 8 boxes * 4 scarves per box = <<8*4=32>>32 scarves.

Step 3: Inside each box, there are also 6 mittens. So, we have a total of 8 boxes * 6 mittens per box = <<8*6=48>>48 mittens.

Step 4: To find the total number of winter clothing pieces, we add the number of scarves and mittens together: 32 scarves + 48 mittens = <<32+48=80>>80 pieces of winter clothing.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Decipher the given information.
The problem states that Frank and his friend were buying trick decks from the magic shop. The cost for each deck is $7. Frank bought 3 decks, and his friend bought 2 decks.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of decks Frank bought.
To find the cost of the decks Frank bought, we can multiply the number of decks he bought by the cost per deck: 3 decks * $7 per deck = $21

Step 3: Calculate the cost of decks his friend bought.
Similarly, we can calculate the cost of the decks his friend bought: 2 decks * $7 per deck = $14

Step 4: Sum up the total amount spent.
Finally, to find the total amount spent by both Frank and his friend, we can add the cost of the decks Frank bought to the cost of the decks his friend bought: $21 (Frank) + $14 (friend) = $35

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sam had 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts. In total, he had 40 + 23 = 63 shirts.
2. He had to wash all of them before school.
3. He washed 29 of them before the school started.

To find out how many shirts he didn't wash, we simply subtract the number of shirts he did wash from the total number of shirts:

4. The number of shirts he didn't wash is 63 (total shirts) - 29 (shirts he washed) = 34 shirts.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's understand the given information. The waiter had 47 customers to wait on. Later, 41 customers left, and he got another 20 customers.

Step 2: Let's find out how many customers the waiter is currently serving. We know that 41 customers left and there were initially 47 customers. So, we subtract the number of customers who left from the total number of customers: 47 (initial customers) - 41 (customers who left) = {The final answer is: 6 customers}.

Step 3: Now, we know that the waiter got another 20 customers. Adding these customers to the current number of customers we have: 6 (current customers) + 20 (new customers) = {The final answer is: 26 customers}.

So, the waiter currently has 26 customers.</s>",26
