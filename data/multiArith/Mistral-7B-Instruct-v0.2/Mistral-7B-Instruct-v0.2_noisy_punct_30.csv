                    :  Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 ; old songs ; from it and ? then added 8 . new songs, . how many songs does she ? have on her mp3 player? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Paige initially had 11 songs on her mp3 player.

Step 2: She deleted 9 old songs from it. So, the number of songs on her mp3 player after deleting old songs is:
11 (initial songs) - 9 (deleted songs) = 2 songs

Step 3: Then, she added 8 new songs to her mp3 player. So, the final number of songs on her mp3 player is:
2 (after deletion) + 8 (new songs) = 10 songs

{The final answer is: Paige has 10 songs on her mp3 player.}</s>",10

                 [/INST] To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we need to subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out. Let's go through this step by step:

1. We know that there were 39 girls and 4 boys who tried out, so the total number of students is:
   Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys
   = 39 + 4
   = 43

2. We're told that 26 students were called back, so the number of students who didn't make the cut is:
   Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students - Number of students who were called back
   = 43 - 26
   = 17

Therefore, the final answer is: 17 students didn't make the cut.</s>",17

                 [/INST] Step 1: Faye started with 34 coloring books.

Step 2: She gave away 3 books, so she had 34 - 3 = 31 books left.

Step 3: She bought 48 more books.

Step 4: To find the total number of coloring books Faye has now, add the number of books she had left after giving some away to the number of books she bought.

Total = 31 (remaining after giving some away) + 48 (newly bought) = 79

{The final answer is: Faye has 79 coloring books in total.}</s>",79

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. The school cafeteria had 23 apples initially.
2. They used 20 apples to make lunch for the students. So, the number of apples left is: 23 (initial apples) - 20 (apples used) = 3 apples.
3. Then they bought 6 more apples. So, the total number of apples they have now is: 3 (remaining apples) + 6 (newly bought apples) = 9 apples.
4. Based on the given information, there was no mention of the number of students, so we can't precisely determine how many apples they would have for a specific number of students.

Therefore, the final answer to your question is: The school cafeteria had 9 apples. However, the number of apples required for a specific number of students was not provided in your question.</s>",9

Step 2: A level has 11 enemies in total.
Step 3: We are destroying all but 3 of these enemies.

Step 4: To find the number of enemies we are destroying, we subtract the number of enemies we are leaving from the total number of enemies: 11 (total enemies) - 3 (enemies left) = 8 enemies destroyed.

Step 5: To find the total number of points earned, we multiply the number of enemies destroyed by the number of points earned per enemy: 8 (enemies destroyed) × 9 (points per enemy) = 72 points.

                 [/INST] To find out how much money April earned during the sale, we first need to determine how many roses she sold. We know that she started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left. so, she sold:

13 (starting roses) - 4 (remaining roses) = 9 roses

Next, we need to find out how much money she earned for each rose and how much money she earned in total. we're given that each rose was sold for $4.

To find the total amount of money earned, we multiply the number of roses sold by the price per rose:

Total money earned = Number of roses sold * Price per rose
= 9 roses * $4 per rose
= $36

So, {The final answer is $36}.</s>",36

1. Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts.
2. He had to wash 21 long sleeve shirts.
3. In total, he had to wash 9 + 21 = <ins>30 shirts.</ins>

However, the problem states that he only washed 29 of them before school started. To find out how many he didn't wash, we can subtract the number of washed shirts from the total number of shirts he needed to wash:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of people who attended the luncheon.
The number of people who attended is the total invited minus the number who didn't show up.

Total invited = 47
People who didn't show up = 7

Number of people who attended = Total invited - People who didn't show up
Number of people who attended = 47 - 7
Number of people who attended = 40

Step 2: Determine the number of tables needed.
Each table holds 5 people.

Number of people per table = 5
Number of tables needed = Number of people who attended / Number of people per table

Number of tables needed = 40 / 5
Number of tables needed = 8

However, since tables come in whole units, you cannot have a fraction of a table. To accommodate all the attendees, you would need to use one extra table. Therefore, you'll need a total of 9 tables for the event.

{The final answer is: 9 tables are needed for the luncheon.}</s>",8

                    question:
                     Tom had 5 , books. If ! he sold 4 of them and used ! the , money he earned to buy 38 new : books, how many books would Tom ! have? 
                 [/INST] Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Tom initially had 5 books.
2. He sold 4 of his books and earned money from the sale.
3. He used the earnings to buy 38 new books.

First, let's determine how many books Tom has left after selling 4 of his initial books:

Tom's books initial = 5
Tom's books sold = 4

Tom's books remaining = Initial books - Sold books
Tom's books remaining = 5 - 4
Tom's books remaining = 1

Now, we need to find out how many books Tom has in total after buying 38 new books with the earnings from selling his initial 5 books. Let's assume the price of each new book is X. With 4 books sold, Tom would have earned 4 * X = sale price. Tom bought 38 new books for this price, so we can set up an equation:

Sale price = 4 * X
38 * X = Sale price

We know that Sale price = 4 * X, so:

38 * X = 4 * X
Let X = 10 (we will find later that X = 10 is a valid solution)

Now let's check if 10 is the correct value for X:

38 * 10 = 380
4 * 10 = 40

Sale price = 4 * X = 4 * 10 = 40
We have confirmed that X = 10 is a valid solution.

So, Tom has 1 book remaining from his initial books and has bought 38 new books.

Tom's total books = Initial books (remaining) + New books
Tom's total books = 1 + 38
Tom's total books = 39

{The final answer is: Tom would have 39 books in total}</s>",39

                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Jerry's fridge would fill up, we first need to determine the total number of sodas he bought and then divide that number by the number of sodas that can be stored on each shelf.

Step 1: Find the total number of sodas Jerry bought.
Total number of sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
Total number of sodas = 41 + 22
Total number of sodas = 63

Step 2: Determine how many shelves would be filled up.
Shelves filled up = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
Shelves filled up = 63 / 9

Let's calculate the fraction part to see if we would need an additional shelf:
Fractional part = Remainder of the division / Dividend
Fractional part = 3 / 9
Fractional part = 1/3

Since 1/3 of a shelf is not possible, Jerry would need to fill up the next whole number of shelves, which would be the ceilings value of Shelves filled up.

Step 3: Find the number of shelves Jerry would fill up.
Shelves filled up = Ceiling(63 / 9)
Shelves filled up = Ceiling(6.9)
Shelves filled up = 7

{The final answer is Jerry would fill up 7 shelves in his fridge.}</s>",7

Debby had 32 pieces, and her sister had 42 pieces.
Total candy = Debby's candy + Sister's candy
Total candy = 32 + 42
Total candy = 74

Step 2: Determine how many pieces of candy they ate on the first night.
They ate 35 pieces of candy.

Step 3: Find out how many pieces of candy are left.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Emily started with 41 seeds. She planted 29 seeds in the big garden.
So, the number of seeds planted in the big garden is 41 - 29 = 12 seeds.

Step 2: Emily put 4 seeds in each small garden.

Step 3: To find out how many small gardens Emily has, we need to divide the number of seeds she planted in the small gardens by the number of seeds she planted in each small garden.

Number of small gardens = Number of seeds planted in small gardens / Seeds planted in one small garden
Number of small gardens = (29 seeds) / (4 seeds/garden)

Step 4: Calculate the number of small gardens
Number of small gardens = 29 / 4 = 7.25

Since there cannot be a fraction of a garden, we must round down to the nearest whole number.

The final answer is: Emily had 7 small gardens.</s>",3

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the total number of candies Emily received.
Emily received 5 pieces from her neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister.
Total candies = 5 (from neighbors) + 13 (from older sister) = <<5+13=8=>>8 pieces

Step 2: Find out how many candies Emily can eat in a day.
Emily can eat 9 pieces of candy a day.

Step 3: Calculate how many days the candies will last.
Days the candies will last = Total candies / Candies eaten per day
Days the candies will last = 8 / 9

Step 4: Determine the final answer.
This fraction cannot be simplified down further and represents the exact number of days the candies will last based on Emily's daily candy consumption. {The final answer is: It will last for approximately 8/9 days or 2 days and 4 hours.}

Note: It's worth mentioning that 8 divided by 9 is a rational number that, when expressed in its lowest terms, can be shown as 8/9. However, because Emily can't eat a fraction of a candy piece, it's important to mention that this answer is an approximation; the candies will technically last for a little over 2 days but Emily will be able to eat only 2 full days' worth of candies. The fraction 8/9 can be converted to a mixed number by bringing down the digit before the decimal point (8) and representing it as ""1"" with a remainder of 2/9. When 2/9 is written as a mixed number, it can be calculated as 2 and 4/9 which represents 2 days and 4 hours. But most people round this to just 2 days when the decimal fraction is small.</s>",2

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many books Mike is left with after the librarian takes 10.

Step 2: We know that there are initially 82 books and the librarian takes 10, so Mike is left with:

82 (total books) - 10 (books taken by librarian) = 72 books

Step 3: Next, we need to determine how many books Mike can put on each shelf. We're told that he can fit 9 books on one shelf.

Step 4: To find out how many shelves he needs, divide the total number of books Mike is left with by the number of books that fit on each shelf:

72 (total books) / 9 (books per shelf) = 8.0 ≈ 8 shelves

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that a building requires 14 windows in total.
2. The builder has already installed 8 windows.
3. It takes 8 hours to install one window.

First, let's find out how many windows are still left to be installed. We calculate this by subtracting the number of windows that have already been installed from the total number of windows needed:
14 windows (total) - 8 windows (installed) = 6 windows (left)

Now, we'll determine how long it takes to install all 6 remaining windows. Since it takes 8 hours to install one window, we'll need to find out how many hours it takes to install all 6 windows. To do this, we simply multiply the number of windows that still need to be installed by the number of hours it takes to install one window:
6 windows (left) x 8 hours/window = 48 hours (total)

Therefore, {The final answer is 48 hours}. The builder will need 48 hours to install the remaining windows in the building.</s>",48

- The chef cooked 7 more chicken wings for the group.

Step 2: Find out how many chicken wings were cooked in total
- The chef had cooked 9 chicken wings initially.
- He then cooked 7 more chicken wings.
- So, the total number of chicken wings cooked is 9 + 7 = 16

Step 3: Determine how many chicken wings each friend got
- The problem states that the friends got the same amount each.
- Therefore, to find out how many chicken wings each friend got, we need to divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends.
- So, the number of chicken wings each friend got is 16 / 4 = 4

The final answer is: Each friend got 4 chicken wings.</s>",4

Total earnings = Earnings per lawn * Number of lawns
Total earnings = 8 dollars/lawn * 15 lawns
Total earnings = 120 dollars

Step 2: Subtract the earnings John did not receive due to not mowing 7 lawns.
Earnings lost = Earnings per lawn * Number of un-mowed lawns
Earnings lost = 8 dollars/lawn * 7 lawns
Earnings lost = 56 dollars

Step 3: Determine the actual earnings John received by subtracting the earnings lost from the total earnings.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's calculate the total number of puppies at the shelter after the new batch was brought in.
Total number of puppies = Initial number of puppies + Newly arrived puppies
Total number of puppies = 5 + 35
Total number of puppies = 40

Step 2: Now, let's find out how many days it takes for all the puppies to be adopted at the rate of 8 puppies per day:
Number of days = Total number of puppies / Puppies adopted per day
Number of days = 40 / 8
Number of days = 5

However, it seems there is a mistake in the question or problem statement itself as the number of puppies adopted per day is more than the total number of puppies. Let's adjust the calculation based on the given information.

Step 3: Let's calculate how many puppies get adopted in total:
Total number of puppies adopted = Total number of puppies / Puppies adopted per day
Total number of puppies adopted = 40 / 8
Total number of puppies adopted = 5 days * 8 = 40

So, it would take 5 days for all 40 puppies to be adopted at the rate of 8 puppies per day. {The final answer is 5 days}. It's important to note that if the rate of adoption is less than 8 puppies per day, the number of days necessary for all puppies to be adopted will be greater than 5 days.</s>",5

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem
- Paige had a certain number of math and science problems for homework.
- She finished some problems at school, leaving her with a certain number of problems to do at home.

Step 2: Identify the given and unknown quantities
- Given: Paige had 43 math problems and 12 science problems for homework. She finished 44 problems at school.
- Unknown: The number of problems Paige had left to do for homework.

Step 3: Set up an equation
- Let M be the number of math problems Paige had left to do for homework, and S be the number of science problems left.
- We know that M + S = Total number of problems Paige had for homework - Problems she finished at school
- Total number of problems for homework = 43 math problems + 12 science problems = 55 problems
- Problems she finished at school = 44

Step 4: Solve the equation
- M + S = 55 - 44
- M + S = 11

Step 5: Find possible values for M and S
- Since there are more science problems than what's left (12 > 1), it's likely that all the science problems have been completed, and only math problems remain.
- Let's check this possibility: if M = 0, then S = 11. However, since there were only 12 science problems initially, this solution doesn't work.
- Let's try adjusting the value of M and keep S as a constant:
  - M = 1: S = 10
  - M = 2: S = 9
  - M = 3: S = 8
  - ...
  - M = 8: S = 2
  - M = 9: S = 1
- The smallest possibility that satisfies the conditions is when M = 9 and S = 1.

Step 6: Interpret the solution
- Paige had to do 9 math problems and 1 science problem for homework.

Step 2: During the lunch rush, an additional 27 customers came in. So in total, the waiter served 26 + 27 = <<26+27=53>>53 customers.

Step 3: The problem states that 27 customers did not leave a tip, which is a third of the total number of customers served. So, a third of the customers did not leave a tip.

Step 4: We know that one-third of the total number of customers is equal to 27 customers. To find out how many customers did leave a tip, we need to find out how many customers comprised the other two-thirds.

Step 5: Subtracting the number of customers who didn't leave a tip (27) from the total number of customers (53), we get the number of customers who did leave a tip: 53 - 27 = <<53-27=26>>26 customers.

Total number of bears = Initial stocks + New shipment
Total number of bears = 17 + 10
Total number of bears = 27

Next, we need to find out how many bears can fit on each shelf. We are told that they put 9 bears on each shelf:

Number of bears per shelf = 9

Finally, to determine the number of shelves they used, we divid the total number of bears by the number of bears that can fit on each shelf:

Number of shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears per shelf

Step 2: Calculate the total number of books on mystery shelves. Since there are 5 mystery shelves, we have:
Total number of mystery books = Number of books per shelf * Number of shelves
Total number of mystery books = 4 books/shelf * 5 shelves
Total number of mystery books = 20 books

Step 3: Calculate the total number of picture books. Since there are 3 picture shelves, but the number of books per shelf is undefined in the question, we can't determine the exact number of picture books at this moment. Therefore, more information is needed to solve the problem completely.

1. Find the total number of members in each group:
total members per group = boys per group + girls per group
Since each group is supposed to be of size 9, we can set up an equation to find the number of boys and girls in a group:

9 = boys + girls

2. Solve for the number of girls:
girls = 9 - boys

For the given numbers of 5 boys and 45 girls, we need to make groups of size 9:

3. Calculate how many groups of 9 boys we can make:
number of groups for boys = total boys / boys per group
number of groups for boys = 5 / 9 ≈ 0.56 (rounded), so we cannot make a whole number of groups with just boys

4. Calculate how many groups of 9 girls we can make:
number of groups for girls = total girls / girls per group
number of groups for girls = 45 / 9 = 5

Since we cannot make a whole number of groups with just boys, we need to make groups that include both boys and girls.

5. Calculate how many groups with a mix of boys and girls we can make:
total groups = number of groups for boys + number of groups for girls
total groups = 0 + 5 = 5

However, since we had 5 boys, and each group must contain at least one boy, we were actually able to make an additional group with only the 5 boys. Therefore:

Step 2: Each member who showed up scored 9 points. To find the total number of points scored, we need to multiply the number of members who showed up by the number of points each member scored.

Total points = Number of members who showed up * Points per member
= (11! - 6) * 9

Step 3: Expanding the factorial expression and performing the subtraction, we have:

11! = 11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1

11! - 6 = (11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) - (6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1)
= (11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) / (6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1)
= (11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7) / (3 x 2)
= (11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7) / 6

Therefore, the total number of points scored is:

Total points = (11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7) / 6
= 330

To find out how many bouquets Wendy could still make, we need to subtract the wilted flowers from the total flowers and then divide the remaining flowers by the number of flowers used per bouquet.

Step 1: Calculate the number of remaining fresh flowers.
- Number of fresh flowers: Total flowers picked - wilted flowers = 103 - 47 = 56

Step 2: Divide the remaining fresh flowers by the number of flowers used per bouquet.
- Number of bouquets she could make with the remaining fresh flowers: 56 / 8 = 7.0625

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many sodas Tom bought in total. We know he bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas, so:

Total number of sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
= 4 + 52
= 56

Step 2: Next, we need to find how many sodas Tom can store on each shelf in his fridge. We know each shelf can hold 7 sodas.

Number of sodas per shelf = 7

Step 3: To find out how many shelves Tom needs to fill up completely, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas he can store on each shelf.

Number of shelves = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
= 56 / 7

Since we cannot have a fractional number of shelves, we must round up or use multiple shelves to store all of Tom's sodas:

Number of shelves ≈ 8

So, Tom would need approximately 8 shelves to store all of his sodas. {The final answer is approximately 8 shelves.}</s>",8

                 [/INST] To find out how many trips Luke makes, we first need to determine how many trays he can carry in each trip and then calculate the number of trips required to pick up all the trays from both tables.

1. Luke can carry 4 trays at a time.
2. From Table 1, he needs to pick up 20 trays.
3. From Table 2, he needs to pick up 16 trays.

First, let's find out how many trays Luke carries in one trip. He can carry 4 trays, so each trip he makes, 4 trays are transported.

Next, we'll figure out how many trips it takes to carry all the trays from Table 1:
Trips for Table 1 = Total trays at Table 1 / Trays per trip
                       = 20 trays / 4 trays per trip
                       = 5 trips

Similarly, we'll find out how many trips it takes to carry all the trays from Table 2:
Trips for Table 2 = Total trays at Table 2 / Trays per trip
                       = 16 trays / 4 trays per trip
                       = 4 trips

Finally, we add the number of trips required to pick up all the trays from both tables:
Total Trips = Trips for Table 1 + Trips for Table 2
             = 5 trips + 4 trips
             = 9 trips

                 [/INST] To find out how many 8-dollar toys Frank can buy after receiving an additional allowance of 37 dollars, we first need to determine how much money Frank has in total.

Step 1: Find out how much money Frank has in total.
Frank had saved up 3 dollars.
He received an additional 37 dollars as allowance.

Total money Frank has = Savings + Allowance
Total money Frank has = 3 dollars + 37 dollars
Total money Frank has = 40 dollars

Step 2: Determine how many 8-dollar toys Frank can buy with the total amount of money.

Number of toys Frank can buy = Total money / Price per toy
Number of toys Frank can buy = 40 dollars / 8 dollars
Number of toys Frank can buy = 5 toys

                    question:
                     ? Tiffany baked 8 brownies, but needed 17 ! total for ; her party. If she : used 8 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many more cups of flour Tiffany needs, we first need to determine how many brownies she baked in order to have a total of 17 for her party.

Step 1: Determine the number of brownies Tiffany needs for her party.
She baked 8 brownies, and each one requires 8 cups of flour. So, the number of brownies she has baked is:
8 brownies * 8 cups of flour per brownie = 64 cups of flour

To find out how many more cups of flour she needs, we need to find the difference between the number of cups of flour she has used and the number of cups of flour she needs for her party.

Step 2: Find the difference between the cups of flour she has used and the cups of flour she needs.
The number of cups of flour she has used is 64, and the number of cups of flour she needs for her party is 17 * number of brownies needed (which we don't know yet). Let's call the number of brownies needed x.

So, we have:
64 cups of flour (used) = 8 * x cups of flour (needed for each brownie) + 17 * x cups of flour (needed for the party)

We can simplify this equation by first subtracting 8x from both sides to get:
56 cups of flour = 17 * x

Now, we can divide both sides by 17 to find the value of x:
x = 56 cups of flour / 17
x ≈ 3.352 brownies

However, we cannot bake a fractional number of brownies, so Tiffany needs to bake an additional 4 or 5 brownies to have a total of 17 for her party.

Step 3: Find out the number of additional brownies needed.
Since she can't bake a fractional brownie, she needs to bake at least 1 more brownie to reach 18 brownies in total:

18 brownies = 17 brownies (from her party) + 1 extra brownie

However, if she needs exactly 17 brownies for her party, she can make up the difference by baking just 1 more brownie and having a small piece from the last one she baked:

19 brownies = 17 brownies (from her party) + 1 extra brownie taken from the last one she baked

Given that she might prefer not to make the last brownie a partial one, she should consider baking an additional 2 brownies:

19 brownies = 17 brownies (from her party) + 2 extra brownies

Now, let's calculate the amount of flour needed for the extra brownies. If each brownie requires 8 cups of flour, then:

2 additional brownies = 16 extra cups of flour

                 [/INST] To find the number of bad carrots, we first need to determine the total number of carrots they picked.

Step 1: Find the number of carrots picked by Carol
Carol picked 29 carrots

Step 2: Find the number of carrots picked by her mother
Her mother picked 16 carrots

Step 3: Find the total number of carrots picked
Total carrots picked = Carrots picked by Carol + Carrots picked by her mother
Total carrots picked = 29 + 16 = 45

Step 4: Find the number of good carrots they picked, which is given as 38

Step 5: Find the number of bad carrots
First, let's find the total number of carrots in the garden:
Total carrots = Total carrots picked
Total carrots = 45

Now we know that there were 38 good carrots, so the number of bad carrots is:

Bad carrots = Total carrots - Good carrots
Bad carrots = 45 - 38
Bad carrots = 7

{The final answer is: They had 7 bad carrots.}</s>",7

Total friends = 10

Next, we need to figure out how many lives each friend had. We're told that each friend had 6 lives. So, to find out how many lives all the friends had together, we can multiply the number of friends by the number of lives each friend has:

                 [/INST] To find out how many piles Bianca could make with the remaining candies, we first need to determine how many pieces of candy are left after she ate 30.

Step 1: Find the number of candies left after eating 30 pieces.
30 (eaten) <-- 78 (total)
====================
48 (remaining)

Step 2: Divide the remaining candies by the number of candies in each pile to find the number of piles.

48 (remaining candies) / 8 (candies per pile) = 6 piles with exactly 8 candies each

However, since Bianca cannot have a pile with fewer than 8 candies, she can only make as many piles as the number of complete piles of 8 she can make with her remaining candies.

Step 3: Check the number of complete piles that can be made with the remaining candies.

Since 8 goes into 48 one time with a remainder of 0:
48 ÷ 8 = 6 complete piles

So, Bianca could make 6 piles.

Step 3: Therefore, we will only be paying for the meals of the 9 adults and the 2 kids.

Step 4: The cost of an adult meal is $8, so we will pay for 9 adult meals: 9 * $8 = $72 (The adults' meals cost a total of $72)

Step 5: Since two kids eat free, we won't pay for their meals.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how much money Frank had left after buying the new mower blades.
Frank made $19 during the summer.
He spent $11 on new mower blades.
So, the money Frank had left is $19 (money made) - $11 (money spent on mower blades).

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Frank had left.
$19 (money made) - $11 (money spent) = $8

Step 3: Determine how many 2-dollar games Frank could buy with the remaining money.
To find out how many 2-dollar games Frank could buy, divide the remaining amount of money by the price of each game.
$.08 (money left) ÷ $2.00 (price of each game) = 0.04
Since there cannot be a fraction of a game, Frank could buy 0 games with exactly $0.08. However, since games cost $2 each, we'll round up to the nearest whole number and subtract one because the $8 already bought 4 games at $2 each.

The final answer is: Frank could buy 4 - 1 = 3 games with the remaining money. Therefore, Frank could buy 3 $2 games.</s>",4

                 [/INST] To find the number of groups the coach can form with 48 new players and 6 returning players, we first need to determine the total number of players available.

Step 1: Find the total number of players.
New players = 48
Returning players = 6
Total players = New players + Returning players
Total players = 48 + 6
Total players = 54

Step 2: Determine the number of players per group.
Each group has 6 players.

Step 3: Calculate the number of groups the coach can form.
Number of groups = Total players / Players per group
Number of groups = 54 / 6
Number of groups = 9 with a remainder of 0

However, since the original question specifies that the coach puts the players ""into groups,"" it's unlikely that there would be a leftover player. So we need to ensure we can form a full group with the available players. Let's check if 54 players are exactly divisible by 6.

Step 4: Check for exact division by the group size.
54 is not exactly divisible by 6. However, we can form 9 groups of 6 players, and the last group would have 2 additional players.

The coach could put the players into 9 groups of 6 and have 2 extra players.

{The final answer is: There would be 9 groups with 6 players each, with 2 extra players.} 

Alternatively, depending on the context of the situation, the coach might choose to make some modifications, such as merging a group to accommodate the remaining players or allowing groups with more than 6 players, but without this information, it's impossible to know for certain.</s>",9

3. Luke packs 4 games into each box, so: <<18/4=4.5>>4.5 boxes are needed to pack all his games. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we'll need to round up and get 5 boxes.

2. 17 students were not picked for the teams.
3. So, the number of students that were picked for the teams is: 65 (total students) - 17 (not picked) = 48 students

1. Isabel uploaded a total of 25 pictures.

2. She put some of these pictures into one album, which contained 10 pictures. Therefore, the number of pictures in the first album is 10.

3. She also put the rest of the pictures into 5 different albums. We know that the number of pictures in the first album is 10, so we can determine the number of pictures in each of the other 5 albums by subtracting the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures and then dividing the result by the number of albums.

4. First, let's find the total number of pictures in all the albums, including the first one: 25 (total pictures) - 10 (in the first album) = 15

5. Since there are 5 different albums, the number of pictures in each of the other 4 albums is the total number of pictures (excluding the ones in the first album) divided by the number of albums: 15 (total pictures in all albums) / 5 (numbers of albums except the first one) = 3

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes the chef to cook the remaining 2 potatoes, we first need to determine how long it took him to cook the 7 potatoes he's already completed. We know that each potato takes 3 minutes to cook.

Step 1: Calculate the time it took to cook the first 7 potatoes.
Time = Number of potatoes * Cooking time per potato
Time = 7 potatoes * 3 minutes/potato
Time = 7 * 3
Time = 21 minutes

Step 2: Find the time it will take to cook the remaining 2 potatoes.
Since we know the chef cooks each potato in 3 minutes, we just need to calculate 3 minutes * Number of potatoes remaining.

Step 3: Calculate the time for the remaining 2 potatoes.
Time = Number of remaining potatoes * Cooking time per potato
Time = 2 potatoes * 3 minutes/potato
Time = 6 minutes

Step 4: Determine the total time it will take the chef to cook all 9 potatoes.
Total time = Time for first 7 potatoes + Time for remaining 2 potatoes
Total time = 21 minutes + 6 minutes
Total time = 27 minutes

Therefore, the final answer is: It will take the chef a total of 27 minutes to cook all 9 potatoes.</s>",6

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Gwen took 41 pictures at the zoo and 29 pictures at the museum. So in total, she took:

Total pictures = Pictures at the zoo + Pictures at the museum
Total pictures = 41 + 29
Total pictures = 70

Step 2: We are then told that she deleted 15 pictures. So the number of pictures she has left is:

Pictures remaining = Total pictures - Pictures deleted
Pictures remaining = 70 - 15

Step 3: Therefore, the final answer is:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of puppies at the shelter.
The shelter had 2 puppies initially, and then 34 more were brought in.
Totalnumberofpuppies = Initialnumberofpuppies + Newlyarrivedpuppies
Totalnumberofpuppies = 2 + 34
Totalnumberofpuppies = 36

Step 2: Calculate how many days it takes to adopt all the puppies with the given adoption rate.
 puppies_adopted_per_day = 4
days_to_adopt_all = Totalnumberofpuppies / Puppiesadoptedperday
days_to_adopt_all = 36 / 4
days_to_adopt_all = 9

So the shelter would take 9 days to adopt out all the puppies at the current adoption rate.

                    question:
                     Will had 59 pieces of clothing to . wash. He put 32 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 9 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each small load, we first need to find out how many clothing pieces were left after the first large load.

1. We know that Will put 32 pieces of clothing in one large load.
2. So, the number of pieces of clothing left to wash in small loads is: 59 (total pieces of clothing) - 32 (pieces in the large load) = 27 pieces of clothing

3. We are told that he wants to split the remaining pieces into 9 equal loads. To find out how many pieces of clothing each small load can contain, we divide the total number of pieces left to be washed in small loads (27) by the number of small loads (9): 27 ÷ 9 = 3.0222...

4. Since we cannot have a fraction of a piece of clothing, we need to round this number up or down. Rounding down would result in 2 loads with 2 pieces each, and 1 load with 3 pieces. However, since Will specifically asked for 9 equal loads, we would need to round up to make all loads equal.

5. Rounding up 3 (each small load) results in: 27 ÷ 3 = 9. While this is technically a fraction, due to the context of the problem, we can assume that it means 9 full loads, each containing 3 pieces of clothing.

The final answer is: {3 pieces of clothing per small load} (assuming Will wants an equal number of pieces in each small load) or alternatively, {2 small loads with 2 pieces each, 1 small load with 3 pieces, and 4 small loads with only 1 piece} (assuming Will wants the minimum amount of clothing in each small load).</s>",3

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many pieces of chocolate candy Adam bought. Since he bought 2 boxes of chocolate candy and each box has 4 pieces, we can calculate this by:

Number of chocolate pieces = Boxes of chocolate * Pieces per box
                            = 2 * 4
                            = 8

Step 2: Determine how many pieces of caramel candy Adam bought. Since he bought 5 boxes of caramel candy and each box has 4 pieces, we can calculate this by:

Number of caramel pieces = Boxes of caramel * Pieces per box
                          = 5 * 4
                          = 20

Step 3: Find the total number of candy pieces Adam bought. We have the number of pieces for both chocolate and caramel, so we add them together to find the total:

Total candy pieces = Chocolate pieces + Caramel pieces
                   = 8 + 20
                   = 28

                 [/INST] To find the total amount Katie spent during the sale at April's Discount Flowers, we need to calculate the cost of roses and daisies she bought separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of 5 roses:
Cost of one rose = $0.60
Number of roses = 5
Total cost of roses = (Cost of one rose) x (Number of roses)
Total cost of roses = $0.60 x 5
Total cost of roses = $3.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of 5 daisies:
Cost of one daisy = $0.60
Number of daisies = 5
Total cost of daisies = (Cost of one daisy) x (Number of daisies)
Total cost of daisies = $0.60 x 5
Total cost of daisies = $3.00

Finally, let's find the total amount spent by adding the cost of roses and daisies together:
Total amount spent = (Total cost of roses) + (Total cost of daisies)
Total amount spent = $3.00 + $3.00
Total amount spent = $6.00

Lives after losing in hard part = 35

Step 2: Add the number of lives Wendy gained in the next level.
Wendy gained 39 lives in the next level.
Total lives = Lives after losing in hard part + Lives gained
Total lives = 35 + 39

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the number of folders Katie ended up with:

1. Katie had 85 files at the beginning.
2. She deleted 40 files, leaving her with 45 files (85 - 40).
3. Katie put the remaining files into folders, each containing 5 files.
4. To find out how many folders she has, we divide the number of files she has left by the number of files per folder:

Will worked at a grocery store making $8 per hour. He worked for 8 hours on Monday and for some hours on Tuesday, which was 2 hours less than on Monday. The problem asks for the total amount of money Will made in those two days.

Step 2: Calculate the earnings for each day
On Monday, Will worked for 8 hours at $8 per hour:
Monday earnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked
Monday earnings = $8 * 8 hours
Monday earnings = $64

On Tuesday, Will worked for 6 hours (8 hours from Monday - 2 hours):
Tuesday earnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked
Tuesday earnings = $8 * 6 hours
Tuesday earnings = $48

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for both days
Total earnings = Monday earnings + Tuesday earnings
Total earnings = $64 + $48
Total earnings = $112

The final answer is: Will made $112 in those two days.</s>",80

2. However, during the game, 2 members didn't show up, so only 3 members were present.
3. Each member that did show up scored 6 points.
4. To find the total number of points scored, we need to multiply the number of members that showed up by the number of points each member scored.

So, the calculation would be:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many books Oliver has left to put away after the librarian took 10.
We know that there were originally 46 books and 10 were taken, so Oliver is left with:

Number of books for Oliver = Original number of books - Books taken
= 46 - 10
= 36 books

Step 2: Find out how many books fit on one shelf.
We're told that Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf.

Step 3: Divide the total number of books Oliver has left by the number of books per shelf to find the number of shelves needed.

Shelves needed = Total number of books for Oliver / Books per shelf
= 36 books / 4 books per shelf
= 9.5 shelves

Since we can't have half a shelf, we need to round up to get the number of shelves required:

Step 4: Round up the number of shelves to ensure all books can be placed.
Shelves needed = Ceiling(Shelves needed)
= Ceiling(9.5)
= 10 shelves

First, we know that Luke had 5 piles of quarters and each pile had 3 coins. So we have:

Number of quarters = Number of piles * Coins per pile
= 5 piles * 3 coins/pile
= 15 coins

Next, we know that Luke had 5 piles of dimes and each pile had 3 coins. So we have:

Number of dimes = Number of piles * Coins per pile
= 5 piles * 3 coins/pile
= 15 coins

Therefore, the total number of coins that Luke had is:

Total number of coins = Number of quarters + Number of dimes

Step 2: It is stated that for every 3 pounds recycled, one point is earned.

Step 3: So, we need to determine how many points Gwen earned for her 5 pounds and how many points her friends earned for their 13 pounds.

Step 4: Gwen recycled 5 pounds, which means she earned: 5 pounds / 3 pounds per point = 1.67 points
Since points can only be earned in whole numbers, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1 point.

Step 5: Her friends recycled 13 pounds, which means they earned: 13 pounds / 3 pounds per point = 4.33 points
Also, rounding down to the nearest whole number, they earned 4 points.

Step 6: To find the total points earned by Gwen and her friends, we add the points they earned individually: 1 point (for Gwen) + 4 points (for her friends) = 5 points

Step 1: Calculate the number of tickets for Haley and her friends.
- Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends.

Step 2: Calculate the number of extra tickets.
- Haley bought 5 extra tickets.

Step 3: Find the total number of tickets Haley bought.
- Total number of tickets = Tickets for herself and friends + Extra tickets
- Total number of tickets = 3 + 5
- Total number of tickets = 8

Step 4: Multiply the number of tickets by the ticket price to find the total amount spent.

So, George has 30 + 16 = <<30+16=46>>46 dollars after receiving his birthday money.
Step 3: He spends 38 dollars on a new game.
Step 4: To find out how much money George has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the game from the total amount of money he had after receiving his birthday money.
So, George has 46 - 38 = <<46-38=7>>7 dollars left.

                 [/INST] To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we first need to determine how many cages there are, and then find out how many birds of each type are in each cage.

1. We know that the pet store has a ratio of 4 : bird : cages. This means that for every 4 cages, there are 3 birds.
2. Since each cage holds 8 parrots and 2 parakeets, we know that each cage holds 8 parrots * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 birds in total.
3. Now we need to find out how many cages there are. Since there is a 4 : 3 ratio of cages to birds, we can set up the proportion: 4cages : 3birds. We know that there are 16 birds in a cage, so we can set up another proportion: 1 cage : 16 birds.
4. To find the number of cages, we can cross multiply the two proportions: (4 * 16) = (3 * cages). Solving for cages: cages = (4 * 16) / 3 = 64/3 ≈ 21.33, BUT we cannot have a fraction of a cage. So, we need to round up to the next whole number knowing that this means we have ordered an extra cage that will not be fully used.
5. Therefore, the pet store has 22 cages in total.
6. To find the number of birds in total, we can multiply the number of cages by the number of birds per cage: 22cages * 16birds = <<22*16=352>>352 birds.

Each box contains 6 pieces, so Kaleb had 14 boxes * 6 pieces per box = 84 boxes * 6 pieces = 504 pieces of chocolate candy.

Step 2: Subtract the number of pieces that Kaleb gave to his brother.
Kaleb gave 5 boxes to his brother, and each box contains 6 pieces, so his brother received 5 boxes * 6 pieces = 30 pieces.
Therefore, Kaleb had 504 pieces - 30 pieces = 474 pieces after giving some to his brother.

1. Robin uploaded 31 pictures from her phone. So the number of pictures she uploaded from her phone is 31.
2. She uploaded 5 pictures from her camera. So the number of pictures she uploaded from her camera is 5.
3. In total, Robin uploaded 31 + 5 = <<31+5=36>>36 pictures to Facebook.
4. She wants to sort these pictures into 9 different albums, each having the same number of pictures.
5. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums: 36 / 9 = <<36/9=4>>4.

Step 2: Calculate how many 5-dollar games Mike could buy with the remaining amount.
To find out how many 5-dollar games Mike could buy, we simply divide the remaining amount by the cost of one game.

Maria spent 8 minutes on each piece of furniture. So, the time it took her to put together one piece is 8 minutes.

She bought 2 chairs and 2 tables. So, the total number of pieces of furniture she bought is 2 chairs + 2 tables = 4 pieces.

To calculate the total time it took her to put together all the furniture, we can multiply the time it took her to put together one piece by the total number of pieces:

                 [/INST] To find out how many baggies Maria can make, we need to determine how many bags can be made with the number of chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies she has.

First, let's calculate how many baggies Maria can make with her chocolate chip cookies:
1. Number of cookies in each bag: 8
2. Number of chocolate chip cookies: 5

Chocolate chip cookies baggies = Total number of chocolate chip cookies / Number of cookies per bag
= 5 / 8

Since Maria can't make a fraction of a baggie, she can only make a whole number of baggies:

Chocolate chip cookies baggies = 5 / 8 ≈ 0.625 ≈ 1 (rounding down)

So, she can make 1 baggie with her chocolate chip cookies.

Next, let's calculate how many baggies Maria can make with her oatmeal cookies:
1. Number of cookies in each bag: 8
2. Number of oatmeal cookies: 19

Oatmeal cookies baggies = Total number of oatmeal cookies / Number of cookies per bag
= 19 / 8

Again, since Maria can't make a fraction of a baggie:

Oatmeal cookies baggies = 19 / 8 ≈ 2.375 ≈ 3

So, she can make 3 baggies with her oatmeal cookies.

To find the total number of baggies Maria can make, we add the number of baggies made with chocolate chip cookies and the number of baggies made with oatmeal cookies:

Total baggies = Chocolate chip cookies baggies + Oatmeal cookies baggies

2. Cost of daisies:
Zoe also bought 2 daisies, with each daisy costing $3. To find the total cost of the daisies, we perform the multiplication as follows:
Cost of daisies = Number of daisies * Cost per daisy
Cost of daisies = 2 * $3
Cost of daisies = $6

3. Total amount spent:
Now, to find the total amount Zoe spent on flowers during the sale, we add the cost of roses and daisies.
Total amount spent = Cost of roses + Cost of daisies
Total amount spent = $24 + $6
Total amount spent = $30

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of books on each shelf for mystery and picture books.
- Mystery books: 8 books/shelf -> Number of shelves = Total number of books / Books per shelf
- Number of shelves for mystery books = Total number of mystery books / Books per shelf
=> Number of shelves for mystery books = 5 shelves
=> Total number of mystery books = Shelves for mystery books * Books per shelf
=> Total number of mystery books = 5 * 8
=> Total number of mystery books = 40

- Picture books: 8 books/shelf -> Number of shelves = Total number of picture books / Books per shelf
- Number of shelves for picture books = Total number of picture books / Books per shelf
=> Number of shelves for picture books = 4 shelves
=> Total number of picture books = Shelves for picture books * Books per shelf
=> Total number of picture books = 4 * 8
=> Total number of picture books = 32

Step 2: Find the total number of books Bianca has.
=> Total number of books = Total number of mystery books + Total number of picture books
=> Total number of books = 40 + 32
=> Total number of books = 72.

                 [/INST] To find out how many pages John would use in his binder to organize his baseball cards, we first need to determine how many cards he has in total and then calculate how many cards can fit on each page.

John has 8 new cards and 16 old cards. So the total number of cards John has is:

Total cards = New cards + Old cards
                 = 8 + 16
                 = 24

Each page of the binder can hold 3 cards, so the number of pages John needs is:

Pages = Total cards / Cards per page
          = 24 / 3

Since we cannot have a fraction of a page, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, as John cannot leave any empty space on a page:

Pages = Ceiling(24/3) = Ceiling(8.0) = 9

Therefore, John would need to use 9 pages in his binder to organize all of his baseball cards.

{The final answer is: John would use 9 pages in his binder to organize his baseball cards.}</s>",8

                    question:
                     Isabel baked 3 brownies, but needed 5 total for her party. If she used 5 cups ? of ? flour on each one, how much cups : of flour does she still need? . 
                 [/INST] To find out how much flour Isabel still needs, we first need to determine how many brownies she needs to bake in total for her party. We know that she has baked 3 brownies, so:

Total brownies needed = Brownies baked + Brownies still needed
Total brownies needed = 3 + x

Next, we need to find out how many cups of flour she uses for one brownie. We're given that she uses 5 cups of flour on each brownie:

Flour used per brownie = 5 cups

To find out how much flour she still needs to make the remaining brownies, we can set up an equation:

Total flour needed = Flour used per brownie * Total brownies needed
Total flour needed = 5 * (3 + x)

To solve for the total flour needed, we first need to find the value of x, which represents the number of brownies she still needs to bake:

x = Total brownies needed - Brownies baked
x = Total brownies needed - 3

Substituting this into the equation for the total flour needed:

Total flour needed = 5 * (3 + (Total brownies needed - 3))

Simplifying the equation:

Total flour needed = 5 * (Total brownies needed)
Total flour needed = 5 * (x + 3)

Substituting the value of x back in:

Total flour needed = 5 * (x + 3)
Total flour needed = 5 * (Total brownies needed - 2)

Now we have an equation where Total flour needed is a multiple of Total brownies needed. To find the value of Total brownies needed, we can set the equation equal to a known multiple and solve for x:

Let's say that Isabel used 15 cups of flour for all 5 browniesshe baked. Then:

5 * (Total brownies needed - 2) = 15

Now we can solve for x:

Total brownies needed - 2 = 3
Total brownies needed = 5

Now that we know Isabel needs 5 brownies in total, we can easily calculate how much flour she still needs:

Total flour needed = 5 * 5 = 25 cups {The final answer is 25 cups of flour}.</s>",10

Step 2: She sold 5 of them, so we subtract these from the number of cupcakes she had to find out how many are left.

Mathematically: 19 (initial number of cupcakes) - 5 (number of cupcakes sold) = 14

Step 3: After selling those 5 cupcakes, Maria made an additional 10 cupcakes.

Step 4: To find the total number of cupcakes Maria has now, we add the number of cupcakes she had left after selling some to the number of new cupcakes she made.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem into steps:

1. Paul filled 6 bags on Saturday. Since each bag holds 8 cans, we can find the number of cans Paul collected on Saturday by multiplying the number of bags by the number of cans in each bag.
2. Paul filled 3 more bags on Sunday. Again, since each bag holds 8 cans, we can find the number of cans Paul collected on Sunday by multiplying the number of bags by the number of cans in each bag.
3. To find the total number of cans Paul collected, we need to add the number of cans he collected on Saturday and the number of cans he collected on Sunday.

Now let's calculate the number of cans Paul collected on each day and the total number of cans he collected:

1. Paul filled 6 bags on Saturday. With each bag holding 8 cans, Paul collected 6 * 8 = <<6*8=48>>48 cans on Saturday.
2. Paul filled 3 more bags on Sunday. With each bag holding 8 cans, Paul collected 3 * 8 = <<3*8=24>>24 cans on Sunday.

- Bianca and her friends are recycling paper for their class.
- They earn one point for every 3 pounds they recycle.
- Bianca recycled 24 pounds and her friends recycled 3 pounds.

Step 2: Find out how many points Bianca earned
- Bianca recycled 24 pounds.
- For every 3 pounds, they earn one point.
- To find out how many points Bianca earned, we divide the number of pounds she recycled by 3.

Step 3: Find out how many points Bianca's friends earned
- Her friends recycled 3 pounds.
- For every 3 pounds, they earn one point.
- To find out how many points her friends earned, we divide the number of pounds they recycled by 3.

Step 4: Add up the total points earned
- Bianca earned x points
- Her friends earned y points
- To find the total points earned, we add the points Bianca earned to the points her friends earned.

{The final answer is x + y}

However, since we don't have the values for x and y in the problem statement yet, we can't give you the final answer. We need to find the number of points each person earned separately before we can find the total.

Step 5: Find out how many points Bianca earned
- Bianca recycled 24 pounds.
- They earn one point for every 3 pounds.
- To find out how many points Bianca earned, we divide the number of pounds she recycled by 3.

x = 24 pounds / 3 pounds/point
x = 8 points

Step 6: Find out how many points her friends earned
- Her friends recycled 3 pounds.
- They earn one point for every 3 pounds.
- To find out how many points her friends earned, we divide the number of pounds they recycled by 3.

y = 3 pounds / 3 pounds/point
y = 1 point

Step 7: Find the total points earned
- Bianca earned 8 points.

First, let's find the total number of players: 2 new players + 6 returning players = 8 players.

Now, we know that each group has 4 players. To find the number of groups, we'll divide the total number of players by the number of players per group: 8 players / 4 players/group = 2 groups.

However, there's a mistake in the question. Since 8 players divide into only 2 groups of 4, it indicates that there's a player left over. But, the question doesn't mention anything about extra players or adjusting the number of players per group to make the remainder evenly distribute.

                 [/INST] To find out how many pieces of clothing can go in each of the small loads, we first need to determine how many pieces of clothing are in the larger loads and then subtract that amount from the total number of pieces to find the size of the small loads.

1. Roger puts 48 pieces of clothing in one load.
2. The remaining clothing is to be split into 9 equal loads.
3. So, the size of each small load is the total number of pieces of clothing divided by the number of small loads.

The total number of pieces of clothing is 120.
The number of large loads is 1 (the load with 48 pieces).
So the number of small loads is 9.

Size of each small load = Total number of pieces of clothing / Number of small loads
Size of each small load = 120 / 9
Size of each small load = 13.3333 (approximately)

Since the number of pieces of clothing must be a whole number, we can't have a fractional number of pieces in each small load. Instead, we will round down to 13 pieces per small load.

Therefore, {The final answer is: each small load can hold 13 pieces of clothing.}</s>",8

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many books Roger is left with after the librarian takes some away.

Given that there are 14 books in total and the librarian took 2 books away, so Roger is left with:

14 (total books) - 2 (books taken away) = 12 books

Step 2: Determine how many books can fit on one shelf.

The problem states that Roger can fit 3 books on a shelf.

Step 3: Calculate how many shelves are needed for all the remaining books.

First divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:

12 (books) / 3 (books per shelf) = approximately 4 (shelves needed)

Since shelves come in whole units, Roger would need to use an additional shelf to accommodate all the books:

5 shelves will be required in total {The final answer is}.</s>",4

1. Bianca picked 39 tulips and 49 roses. In total, she picked:
- Tulips: 39
- Roses: 49
- Total flowers: 39 + 49 = 88

2. She made bouquets using only 81 of the flowers. So, the number of flowers used in the bouquets is 81.

3. To find out how many extra flowers Bianca picked, we have to subtract the number of flowers used in the bouquets from the total number of flowers she picked:

- Extra flowers: 88 (total flowers) - 81 (flowers used in bouquets) = 7

Cody bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas. So, the total number of sodas is: 4 (regular sodas) + 44 (diet sodas) = 48 sodas.

Step 2: Figure out how many sodas can fit on one shelf.
Each shelf can hold 6 sodas.

Step 3: Determine how many shelves are needed to hold all of the sodas.
We'll divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can fit on one shelf.

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups the schools debate team can make when splitting into groups of 9, we need to determine the total number of team members first. We have 26 boys and 46 girls, so the total number of team members is:

Total team members = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total team members = 26 boys + 46 girls
Total team members = 72

Now, we want to find out how many groups of 9 team members can be formed from this total. To do this, we'll divide the total number of team members by the number of team members in each group:

Number of groups = Total team members / Team members per group
Number of groups = 72 / 9

To find the exact number of groups, perform the division:

Number of groups = 72 ÷ 9
Number of groups = 8

However, since we can't have a whole group consisting of only 2 team members, we need to round up and add an extra group. So, the final answer is {The final answer is 9 groups, but they can only form 8 full groups of 9 team members, with 3 team members left over}.</s>",8

1. First, let's calculate the total number of apples the cafeteria ordered.
   Total apples = Red apples + Green apples
   = 6 (red) * 1 (box) + 15 (green) * 1 (box)
   = 6 + 15
   = 21 apples

2. Next, let's calculate the number of apples needed when only 5 students wanted fruit.
   Apples for 5 students = Red apples + Green apples (assuming all students get one apple of each color)
   = 6 (red) * 1 (student) + 15 (green) * 1 (student)
   = 6 + 15
   = 11 apples

3. To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we subtract the number of apples needed for 5 students from the total number of apples ordered.

Step 2: Next, we need to calculate how long it takes to cook one potato. We are given that it takes 6 minutes to cook one potato.

Step 3: To find out how long it takes to cook all the remaining potatoes, we need to multiple the time it takes to cook one potato by the number of potatoes left to cook. So,

Total number of pictures = 5 + 35 = 40

Since she wanted to put an equal number of pictures in each of 8 albums, we need to find out how many pictures should be in each album:

Number of pictures in each album = 40 / 8
Number of pictures in each album = 5

However, it seems that there was a miscommunication in the question since the number of pictures in each album cannot be 5, given that Olivia only had 40 pictures in total.

First, let's find out how many baggies Robin can make with the chocolate chip cookies:

Chocolate chip cookies in one baggie = 6 cookies
Number of chocolate chip cookies = 23

So, the number of baggies Robin can make with chocolate chip cookies is:

{Number of baggies with chocolate chip cookies = Total number of chocolate chip cookies / Number of cookies per baggie}

= 23 / 6

= 3 with a remainder of 5

Since Robin can't make a fraction of a baggie, she can make only 3 full baggies with the chocolate chip cookies and discard the remaining 5 cookies or use them to make a baggie with less than 6 cookies if desired.

Next, let's find out how many baggies Robin can make with the oatmeal cookies:

Oatmeal cookies in one baggie = 6 cookies
Number of oatmeal cookies = 25

So, the number of baggies Robin can make with oatmeal cookies is:

{Number of baggies with oatmeal cookies = Total number of oatmeal cookies / Number of cookies per baggie}

= 25 / 6

= 4 with a remainder of 1

Robin can make 4 full baggies with the oatmeal cookies and will have an extra cookie that could potentially be added to one of the baggies to make it a full one, or it could be saved or discarded.

Now, to find the final answer, we add the number of baggies Robin made with chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies together:

{The final answer is = Number of baggies with chocolate chip cookies + Number of baggies with oatmeal cookies}

= 3 + 4

= 7 baggies in total

So, Robin can make a total of 7 baggies with the given number of chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies.</s>",8

                    question:
                     Wendy uploaded 22 pictures from her phone and 2 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics ; into 4 different albums with the same amount ! of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each ? of the albums? 
                 [/INST] To determine how many pictures are in each album, we first need to find out how many pictures Wendy uploaded in total. We know that she uploaded 22 pictures from her phone and 2 pictures from her camera, so:

Total pictures uploaded = Pictures from phone + Pictures from camera
= 22 + 2
= 24 pictures

Now Wendy wants to sort her pictures into 4 different albums, each with the same number of pictures. Let's find out how many pictures there should be in each album:

Number of pictures in each album = Total pictures uploaded / Number of albums
= 24 / 4
= 6 pictures

Therefore, if Wendy wants to evenly distribute her uploaded pictures into 4 different albums, each album should contain 6 pictures.

{The final answer is: Each album should contain 6 pictures.}</s>",6

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the total number of candies Katie and her sister had.
Katie had 8 pieces, and her sister had 23 pieces. Therefore, the total number of candies is:
8 (from Katie) + 23 (from her sister) = 31 pieces

Step 2: Subtract the number of candies they ate on the first night.
They ate 8 pieces the first night. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of candies to find out how many pieces they have left:
31 (total pieces) - 8 (pieces they ate) = 23 pieces

{The final answer is 23 pieces of candy left}.</s>",23

                 [/INST] To find out how many cages the pet store used, we first need to determine how many puppies they had left after selling 34 on the first day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of puppies left after the first day's sales.
88 (total puppies) - 34 (puppies sold) = <<88-34=54>>54 puppies remaining

Step 2: Divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies each cage can hold to determine the number of cages needed.
54 (puppies remaining) / 6 (puppies per cage) = <<54/6=9>>9 cages required with full capacity

Since they can't have a fraction of a cage, the pet store would need to get 10 cages to hold all of their remaining puppies. {The final answer is: 10 cages}</s>",9

                 [/INST] To determine how many trips Jerry will make to pick up the trays, we first need to find out how many trays he can carry in each trip. We know that Jerry can only carry 8 trays at a time.

Next, we need to find out how many trays he needs to pick up in total. From the problem statement, we know that he needs to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another table.

So, the total number of trays Jerry needs to carry is:

Total trays = Trays from table 1 + Trays from table 2
Total trays = 9 trays + 7 trays
Total trays = 16 trays

Now, we need to figure out how many trips Jerry will make to carry all of these trays. Since we know that Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, we can divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry in each trip:

Number of trips = Total trays / Trays per trip
Number of trips = 16 trays / 8 trays
Number of trips = 2 trips + 1 additional trip

The reason we need an additional trip is that Jerry cannot carry a half tray, so he cannot carry all 16 trays in just two trips.

Therefore, the final answer is that Jerry will make a total of 3 trips to pick up all of the trays.</s>",2

Points on first level = 14

Step 2: Calculate the number of points Faye earned on the second level by finding 6 treasures:
Points on second level = Number of treasures found * Points per treasure
Points on second level = 6 * 7
Points on second level = 42

Step 3: Calculate Faye's total score by adding the points she earned on both levels:

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. Wendy started with 82 files.
2. She deleted 37 files, leaving her with 82 - 37 = 45 files.
3. She then put the remaining files into folders, each containing 5 files.
4. To find out how many folders she ended up with, we need to divide the number of files put into folders by the number of files per folder: 45 files / 5 files per folder = 9 folders

However, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement, as the number of files Wendy ended up with after deleting is not a multiple of 5, which is required for the number of files per folder. It's possible that this was a mistake in the problem statement and not representative of the actual situation.

Assuming the problem statement is correct, the answer would be: There is a mistake in the problem statement. Wendy cannot have ended up with the number of files stated while following the given conditions.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of players.
The problem states that there are 12 new players and 44 returning players. So, the total number of players is:
Total number of players = New players + Returning players
Total number of players = 12 + 44
Total number of players = 56

Step 2: Determine the number of players in each group.
The problem states that each group would consist of 8 players.

Step 3: Determine the number of groups.
To find the number of groups, divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group:
Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players per group
Number of groups = 56 / 8
Number of groups = 7 with a remainder of 2

Since there cannot be a fraction of a group, we will need to form an additional group with the remaining 2 players.

So, the answer is:

$104 - $41
$63

Step 2: Determine how many 9-dollar games Will can buy with the money he had left.

He has $63 left.
Each game costs $9.

So, the number of games Will can buy is:

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The chef has cooked 6 potatoes already, so he has 12 - 6 = <<12-6=6>>6 potatoes left to cook.
2. It takes 6 minutes to cook one potato.
3. Therefore, to cook 6 potatoes, it will take 6 potatoes * 6 minutes/potato = <<6*6=36>>36 minutes.
4. The chef has already spent 36 minutes cooking, so to find out how long it will take to cook the rest, we need to find the time it takes to cook the remaining 6 potatoes.
5. That would be 6 potatoes * 6 minutes/potato = <<6*6=36>>36 minutes.
6. However, the chef has spent 36 minutes already, so to find out the additional time required, we subtract the time already spent from the time needed for the total number of potatoes.
7. The difference is (36 minutes for 6 potatoes + 36 minutes for 6 potatoes) - 36 minutes = <<(36+36)-36=72>>72 minutes.

Since each flower cost $3 according to the question, there's no need for any further calculations here.

Step 2: Calculate the number of each type of flower Emily bought:
Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies.

Step 3: Find the cost of roses:
The cost of roses is the price of each rose multiplied by the number of roses Emily bought.
So, Cost of roses = $3/flower * 2 roses = $6.

Step 4: Find the cost of daisies:
The cost of daisies is the price of each daisy multiplied by the number of daisies Emily bought.
So, Cost of daisies = $3/flower * 2 daisies = $6.

Step 5: Calculate the total amount Emily spent:
Total amount spent = Cost of roses + Cost of daisies.
Total amount spent = $6 (for roses) + $6 (for daisies) = $12.

                 [/INST] To find out how many bad carrots there were in total, we first need to determine the number of carrots that Faye and her mom picked that were good. We know that Faye picked 23 carrots and her mom picked 5 carrots, so in total they picked:

Total carrots picked = Carrots picked by Faye + Carrots picked by her mom
= 23 + 5
= 28

We're told that only 12 of these carrots were good, so the number of bad carrots is:

Bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Good carrots
= 28 - 12
= 16

Therefore, {The final answer is 16 bad carrots}.</s>",16

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers Isabel picked.
Isabel picked 66 flowers.

Step 2: Find out how many flowers are in each bouquet.
Each bouquet has 8 flowers.

Step 3: Determine how many bouquets Isabel originally planned to make.
 number of bouquets = total number of flowers / number of flowers per bouquet
 number of bouquets = 66 / 8
 number of bouquets = 8.25
 Since you cannot make a fraction of a bouquet, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.
 number of bouquets = 8

Step 4: Find out how many bouquets Isabel could make after 10 flowers wilted.
Since 10 flowers wilted, the number of bouquets Isabel could make is:
 number of bouquets = (total number of flowers - flowers that wilted) / number of flowers per bouquet
 number of bouquets = (66 - 10) / 8
 number of bouquets = 6.125
 Once again, we cannot make a fraction of a bouquet, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, Isabel could make {6} bouquets with the remaining flowers.</s>",7

 A pet store had 38 siamese cats and 25 ! house cats. : During a sale they sold 45 cats. How many . cats ; do . they have left? ,"<s> [INST]

                    question:
                     A pet store had 38 siamese cats and 25 ! house cats. : During a sale they sold 45 cats. How many . cats ; do . they have left? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many cats of each type were sold.
Since there were 38 Siamese cats and 25 Houses cats in total, and they sold 45 cats, we can calculate how many of each type was sold.

Siamese cats sold = Number of Siamese cats initially - Number of Siamese cats remaining
Siamese cats sold = 38 - x

House cats sold = Number of House cats initially - Number of House cats remaining
House cats sold = 25 - y

Step 2: Solve for the number of cats sold of each type from the given information.
From the problem, it's given that 45 cats were sold in total. So, we can set up an equation to find the number of cats of each type that were sold:

Total cats sold = Siamese cats sold + House cats sold
45 = (38 - x) + (25 - y)

Step 3: Solve the equation to find the number of cats sold of each type.
We need to distribute the given value of 45 across both sides of the equation. In order to do this, first, we need to get rid of the brackets:

45 = 38 - x + 25 - y

Now combine the constants term on the left side:

45 = 63 - (x + y)

Next, since we need to find the value of x and y, let's make this a system of linear equations by introducing a new variable:
z = x + y

Now our system of equations looks like:

45 = 63 - z
z = x + y

Step 4: Find the values of x and y.
Solve for z in terms of x from the second equation:
z = x + y

Substitute z from the first equation:

45 = 63 - z
--> 45 = 63 - (x + y)
--> 45 = 63 - x - y
--> 18 = - x - y
--> x + y = -18 (1)

As we have one equation with two variables, we need to find another solution to determine the unique solution. We can find a solution by using additional information or making assumptions. Since the number of cats in the problem is not negative, we know that x and y cannot be negative. Hence, we assume that x > 0 and y < 0, making x + y negative.

With this assumption, we can write the equation as:

x = -y + 18

Now let's check if this solution fits our initial conditions (x > 0 and y < 0).

Substitute x from the equation (1) with x = -y + 18:

x + y = -18
-y + 18 + y = -18
18 = -y
y = -18 + 18
y = 0

However, this does not satisfy y < 0. So, we need to try another approach by assuming x < 0 and y > 0.

With this assumption, we can write the equation as:

x = -y + 18
x = -(18 - x)
x + 18 = -18 + x
x + 18 = x - 18
2x = -1
x = -1/2

Since x must be a whole number (since it represents the number of Siamese cats), we cannot have x = -0.5.

We need to try another assumption to find a valid solution. Based on the information provided, we cannot guarantee an exact solution other than knowing that the difference between the number of Siamese cats and the number of House cats is greater than 13 (38 - 25 = 13).

Therefore, without more information, we cannot determine the exact number of Siamese and House cats remaining in the pet store.

{The final answer is: We cannot determine the exact number of Siamese and House cats left.}</s>",18

                 [/INST] To find out how many points Carol had at the end of the game, we need to find the total number of points she scored in all three rounds.

1. In the first round, Carol scored 17 points.
2. In the second round, she scored 6 points.
3. In the last round, she lost 16 points.

To find the total number of points Carol had, we add the number of points she scored in the first and second rounds, and then subtract the number of points she lost in the last round:

Total points = Points scored in round 1 + Points scored in round 2 - Points lost in round 3

Substituting the given values:

Total points = 17 + 6 - 16

Simplifying:

Total points = 17 + 6 - 16

Total points = 17 + 0

Total points = 17

So, Carol had 17 points at the end of the game.
