                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of roses April bought during the sale.
April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left. So, she bought a total of 13 + 4 = 17 roses.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of each rose during the sale.
Each rose cost 4 dollars.

Step 3: Find the total cost of the roses April bought.
Total cost = Number of roses * Cost per rose
Total cost = 17 * 4
Total cost = 68 dollars

Step 4: Find the amount of money April earned during the sale.
We don't have the original cost of the roses before the sale. However, we know she paid 68 dollars for 17 roses during the sale, so we can determine how much she saved during the sale.

Step 5: Calculate the savings April got during the sale.
Savings = Total cost before the sale * (1 - Savings rate) - Total cost
However, in this case, we don't have the total cost before the sale, so we cannot find the savings directly. All we can determine is how much money April earned during the sale by subtracting the cost of the roses she bought from her total earnings.

The final answer is: Aprils earnings during the sale are 68 dollars. However, without knowing the original cost of the roses, we cannot determine her savings.</s>",36,36.0,68.0

                 [/INST] To determine how many tables the company needs for the luncheon, we first need to find out how many people actually showed up.

1. Total number of invited people: 47
2. Number of people who didn't show up: 7
3. Number of people who attended: Total number of invited people - Number of people who didn't show up = 40

Now, let's determine how many tables are needed for the 40 people based on the seating arrangement.

1. Each table seats 5 people.
2. To find the number of tables needed, divide the total number of people by the number of people each table can seat and round up to the nearest whole number (as each table must seat a full complement of seated people): Number of tables = Total number of people / Number of people per table = 40 / 5 = 8 tables
3. Since each table seats 5 people, and 4 people are seated at a table when it is full, one additional table is needed to accommodate all 40 people: Number of tables = Ceiling(40 / 5) = 9

{The final answer is: 9 tables}

Therefore, the company needs to rent or set up 9 tables to accommodate all the attendees.</s>",8,8.0,9.0

Step 2: Tom used the money he earned from selling 4 books to buy new books.
- The number of new books Tom bought is given as 38.

Step 3: To find the total number of books Tom has, we must add his remaining books and the new books he bought.

Total number of sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
Total number of sodas = 41 + 22
Total number of sodas = 63

Next, we need to figure out how many sodas can fit on one shelf. Jerry's fridge can hold 9 sodas on each shelf.

Now, we can divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can fit on one shelf to find out how many shelves he will need.

Number of shelves = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
Number of shelves = 63 / 9
Number of shelves = 7.0

Since Jerry's fridge can't have a fraction of a shelf, he'll need to round up to the next whole number.

Total seeds = 41
Seeds in big garden = 29

Seeds in small gardens = Total seeds - Seeds in big garden
Seeds in small gardens = 41 - 29
Seeds in small gardens = 12

Now, we know that she put 4 seeds in each small garden. So we can find out how many small gardens she has by dividing the total number of seeds in the small gardens by the number of seeds in each small garden:

Small gardens = Seeds in small gardens / Seeds per small garden
Small gardens = 12 / 4

Small gardens = 3

Step 2: The group caused the chef to cook an additional 7 chicken wings.

Step 3: In total, the chef cooked 16 chicken wings for the group (9 before they arrived + 7 for them).

Step 4: To determine how many chicken wings each person in the group of 4 received, we need to divide the total number of chicken wings cooked by the number of people in the group.

Step 5: The calculation would be: Number of chicken wings per person = Total Number of Chicken Wings / Number of People

Step 6: Plugging in the numbers, we have: Number of chicken wings per person = 16 / 4

5 (original) + 35 (new) = 40 puppies

Step 2: We know that 8 puppies are adopted each day. To determine how long it will take for all of the puppies to be adopted, we need to divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day:

Number of days = Total number of puppies / Number of puppies adopted per day
Number of days = 40 / 8

                 [/INST] To calculate the cost of a group of 13 people at the restaurant, we first need to determine how many adults and kids are in the group. We know that 9 people are kids, so the number of adults would be the total number of people minus the number of kids:

Number of adults = Total number of people - Number of kids
Number of adults = 13 - 9
Number of adults = 4

Next, we'll find the cost for the adults to eat by multiplying the number of adults by the cost of an adult meal:

Cost for adults = Number of adults * Cost per adult meal
Cost for adults = 4 * $7
Cost for adults = $28

Finally, since kids eat free, the cost for them is $0. Therefore, the total cost for the group to eat would be the cost for the adults.

1. First, we need to find out how many problems Paige had for homework in math and science combined. We know she had 43 math problems and 12 science problems, so:
   Homework problems = Math problems + Science problems
   = 43 + 12
   = 55

2. However, we made an error in the first step because we forgot that Paige finished 44 problems at school. Those problems were part of her homework but they were already done. So, we need to subtract those 44 problems from our total:

- Rachel found 5 treasures on the first level.
- She found 2 treasures on the second level.

Next, let's calculate the points earned from each level:
- Rachel earns 9 points for each treasure.
- So, on the first level, she earned 5 * 9 = 45 points.
- On the second level, she earned 2 * 9 = 18 points.

To find her total score, we need to add the points from both levels:

Step 4: We're told that 27 of these customers didn't leave a tip.

Step 5: To find out how many customers left a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't tip from the total number of customers.

Step 6: So, the number of customers who left a tip is 53 (total customers) - 27 (customers who didn't tip) = <<53-27=26>>26 customers.

                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves were used to display the new shipment of bears, we first need to determine how many bears in total are now at the toy store. We know that there were originally 17 giant stuffed bears and then they received a shipment of 10 bears.

Total number of bears = Original number of bears + New shipment
Total number of bears = 17 + 10
Total number of bears = 27

Now that we know there are 27 bears in the store, we can divide the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf to determine how many shelves were needed.

Number of shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears per shelf
Number of shelves = 27 / 9

To get a whole number answer, we'll need to perform some division with remainder arithmetic since 27 cannot be evenly divided by 9. So we'll divide 27 by 9 to get the number of full shelves, and then add 1 to account for the remaining bears.

Number of shelves = Full shelves + 1 (for the extra bears)
Number of shelves = (27 ÷ 9) + 1
Number of shelves = 3 + 1

Step 2: Find out how many books are on each shelf of picture books.
Since Gwen wants exactly 4 books on each shelf for picture books, she has:
3 shelves * 4 books/shelf = {12 books} for picture books.

Step 3: Find the total number of books.
To find the total number of books, we add the number of books on the shelves for mystery books and picture books:

                 [/INST] Let's think through this step by step:

1. Wendy uploaded a total of 79 pictures to Facebook.
2. She put 44 pictures into one album. So, the number of pictures in the first album is 44.
3. The remaining pictures were put into 5 different albums. So, the number of albums is 5, and the number of pictures in each album is the total number of pictures minus the number of pictures in the first album.
4. To find the number of pictures in each of the remaining 5 albums, we can calculate it as follows:
   pictures in one album = 44
   total number of pictures = 79
   number of albums = 5
   pictures in each album = total number of pictures / number of albums
   = 79 / 5
   = 15.8
5. Since there cannot be a fraction of a picture, each album must contain an integer number of pictures. Thus, we need to find the closest integer value less than or equal to 15.8, which is 15.
6. Therefore, each of the 5 remaining albums contains 15 pictures.

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups the debate team can make when splitting into groups of 9, we first need to determine the total number of team members. We're given that there are 5 boys and 40 girls.

Total team members = Boys + Girls
Total team members = 5 + 40
Total team members = 45

Now we need to find out how many groups of 9 team members can be made from a team of 45 members. We can calculate this using the formula:

Number of groups = Total team members / Team size per group

Number of groups = 45 / 9
Number of groups = 5

However, this result indicates that we can only form 5 full groups of 9 members each. To find out how many parts or remaining members are left over and how many additional groups can be made from those parts, we need to calculate the remainder of the total team members divided by the team size.

Remainder = Total team members % Team size per group
Remainder = 45 % 9

The remainder is 3

So 5 full groups of 9 team members can be made, and from the leftover members, one more group of 3 team members can be formed. Thus, the debate team can make a total of 6 groups.

Total number of cupcakes Megan baked = 71
Cupcakes Todd ate = 43

Number of cupcakes Megan has left = Total number of cupcakes Megan baked - Cupcakes Todd ate
Number of cupcakes Megan has left = 71 - 43
Number of cupcakes Megan has left = 28

Now, we want to determine how many packages Megan can make, given that each package holds 7 cupcakes.

Packages Megan can make = Number of cupcakes Megan has left / Number of cupcakes in each package
Packages Megan can make = 28 / 7

Packages Megan can make is approximately 4.29 packages. Because she can't make a fraction of a package, Megan will be able to make 4 full packages with her remaining cupcakes.

{The final answer is Megan can make 4 packages.}</s>",4,4.0,4.0

First, let's find out how many trays Luke needs to pick up in total:

Trays from the first table = 20 trays
Trays from the second table = 16 trays

Total trays = Trays from the first table + Trays from the second table
Total trays = 20 trays + 16 trays
Total trays = 36 trays

Now, we know that Luke can carry 4 trays at a time, so we need to divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry in one trip:

Trips required = Total trays / Trays per trip
Trips required = 36 trays / 4 trays per trip

Step 2: The number of lives for the initial 5 friends is calculated by multiplying the number of friends by the number of lives each friend has:  Life_initial = 5 * 8 = 40 lives

Step 3: Two more players join the game, increasing the total number of friends to 7.

Step 4: Since each player still has 8 lives, we calculate the number of lives for these new 2 players: Lives_new = 2 * 8 = 16 lives

Step 5: To find the total number of lives after the new players joined, we add the lives of the initial 5 friends and the new 2 friends:  Total lives = Life_initial + Lives_new = 40 + 16 = 56 lives.

The final answer is: There are a total of 56 lives among the 7 friends in the game.</s>",56,56.0,7.0

                    question:
                     Nancy had 80 files on her ? computer. She deleted 31 of them and put the rest into : folders with 7 files in each one. How many folders did Nancy end up with? 
                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many files Nancy has left after deleting 31. We know she had 80 files, and she deleted 31, so:

80 files (initial) - 31 files (deleted) = 49 files (remaining)

Next, we know that the remaining files are put into folders, and each folder contains 7 files. So to find out how many folders Nancy has, we simply divide the number of remaining files by the number of files per folder:

49 files (remaining) / 7 files (per folder) = 7 folders (approximately)

However, due to the rounding in the initial number of files (80), it's possible that Nancy ended up with an integer number of folders. We can verify this by doing the following calculation:

Number of files per folder * Number of folders = Total number of files
7 files per folder * Number of folders = 49 files

Let x be the number of folders, then we have:
7x = 49
x = 49 / 7 = 7.143 (rounded initially)
x * 7 = 49
7x = 49
x ≈ 7

So, Nancy has approximately 7 folders. However, since the initial number of files was rounded, she might have exactly 7 folders. To double-check, let's calculate the total number of files in her computer after deleting some files and distributing the rest into folders:

Total number of files = Number of remaining files * Number of files per folder + Number of deleted files
Total number of files = 49 files * 7 files per folder + 31 deleted files
Total number of files = 343

Since there were initially 80 files on Nancy's computer and she deleted 31, the total number of files should be:

Initial number of files + Number of deleted files = Total number of files
80 files + 31 files = 111 files

This number does not match the calculated total number of files (343). Hence, Nancy must have exactly 7 folders (with 7 files each) since both the remaining files and the folders they're distributed into are expressed as rounded numbers.

Therefore, {Nancy ended up with exactly 7 folders}.</s>",7,7.0,7.0

Next, we need to find out how many games are in each box. We're told that Luke put 4 games into each box:

Step 2: Determine the number of games per box: 4 games.

Now, to find out how many boxes Luke needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:

Step 3: Calculate the number of boxes needed: 18 games / 4 games per box = 4.5 boxes. Since we can't have half a box, we'll need to round up to get an actual number of boxes:

Step 4: Round up the number of boxes to get the final answer: 5 boxes.

1. First, let's find out how many pieces of clothing Will put in the remaining small loads. He put 32 in one load and had 59 in total. So, the number of pieces of clothing in the small loads is:

Number ofsmall loads = Total pieces of clothing - Pieces of clothes in large load

Therefore, {The final answer is approximately 3 pieces of clothing per small load}. However, it is important to note that 3 cannot evenly divide the remaining 27 pieces, so this would result in an uneven distribution. To have exactly 9 equal loads, Will would need to distribute the remaining clothes unequally, with some loads having more than 3 pieces and others having fewer.

First, let's find out how many books Victor bought in total:
Total number of books = Number of adventure books + Number of mystery books
Total number of books = 32 adventure books + 37 mystery books
Total number of books = 69 books

Next, we're told that 16 of these books were used. So we need to find the number of new books by subtracting the used books from the total:

Number of new books = Total number of books - Number of used books
Number of new books = 69 books - 16 used books

Since Isabel had 2 pages of math homework, and there were 5 problems on each page, we can calculate the number of math problems as follows:
Math problems = Number of pages × Number of problems per page
Math problems = 2 pages ×5 problems/page
Math problems = 10 problems

Step 2: Determine the number of reading problems Isabel had.
Isabel had 4 pages of reading homework, and there were also 5 problems on each page.
Reading problems = Number of pages × Number of problems per page
Reading problems = 4 pages ×5 problems/page

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 4 friends playing the video game online. Each friend had 3 lives, so the total number of lives for the friends was:
   Lives of friends = 4 (number of friends) × 3 (number of lives per friend)

2. Then, 5 more players joined the game. Each new player also had 3 lives, so the total number of lives for these players was:
   Lives of new players = 5 (number of new players) × 3 (number of lives per player)

3. To find the total number of lives for all players, we add the lives of the friends and the lives of the new players:
   Total lives = Lives of friends + Lives of new players

Let's calculate the values for each part:

1. Lives of friends = 4 × 3 = 12 lives
2. Lives of new players = 5 × 3 = 15 lives

Kaleb started with 12 dollars. He spent 8 bucks on a new game, so the amount of money he has left is:

12 dollars (initial amount) - 8 bucks (spending on the game)
= 4 dollars

Step 2:Determine how many 2-dollar toys Kaleb can buy with the remaining 4 dollars.
Since each toy costs 2 dollars, and Kaleb has 4 dollars left, he can buy:

4 dollars (remaining money) / 2 dollars (cost of each toy)
= 2 toys

Therefore, Kaleb can buy 2 toys with the money he had left. {The final answer is 2 toys}.</s>",2,2.0,2.0

1. We know there are 2 shelves of mystery books, so the number of books on those shelves is:
Numbers of books on mystery shelves = Number of shelves * Books per shelf
 = 2 * 6
 = 12 books

2. There are 6 shelves of picture books, so the number of books on those shelves is:
Numbers of books on picture shelves = Number of shelves * Books per shelf
 = 6 * 6
 = 36 books

3. To find the total number of books Nancy has, we add the number of books on the mystery shelves to the number of books on the picture shelves:

Step 3: Now, we need to figure out how many folders Katie would need to store her remaining 45 files. To do this, divide the total number of files by the number of files per folder:

Number of folders = Total number of files / Number of files per folder
= 45 files / 5 files/folder

Number of folders = 9
But since Katie cannot have a partial folder, we need to round up this number to the nearest whole number.

                 [/INST] To find out how many coins Luke has in total, we first need to determine how many coins are in each pile of quarters and each pile of dimes.

1. Number of coins in a pile of quarters: Luke has 5 piles of quarters, and each pile has 3 coins. So, the number of coins in one pile of quarters is 3.
    Since he has 5 piles, the number of coins in all his piles of quarters is 5 * 3 = <<5*3=15>>15 coins.

2. Number of coins in a pile of dimes: Similarly, Luke has 5 piles of dimes, and each pile contains 3 coins. Therefore, the number of coins in one pile of dimes is also 3.
    Since he has 5 piles, the number of coins in all his piles of dimes is 5 * 3 = <<5*3=15>>15 coins.

3. Total number of coins: To find the total number of coins Luke has, we add the number of quarters and the number of dimes. So, Luke has 15 coins of quarters (from step 1) and 15 coins of dimes (from step 2), resulting in a total of 15 + 15 = <<15+15=30>>30 coins.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many points Gwen earned for recycling 5 pounds.
Gwen recycles 5 pounds, and for every 3 pounds she recycles, she earns 1 point. Therefore, the number of points Gwen earns is given by:

Points for Gwen = (Amount she recycled) / (Number of pounds needed for 1 point)
= 5 pounds / 3 pounds/point
= 5/3 points or approximately 1.67 points (rounded down since we cannot have a fraction of a point)

Step 2: Determine how many points her friends earned for recycling 13 pounds.
Her friends recycled 13 pounds, so the number of points they earn is given by:

Points for her friends = (Amount they recycled) / (Number of pounds needed for 1 point)
= 13 pounds / 3 pounds/point
= 4.33 points or approximately 5 points (rounded up since we are dealing with whole numbers of points)

Step 3: Find the total number of points earned by Gwen and her friends.
Since Gwen earned approximately 1.67 points and her friends earned approximately 5 points, the total number of points earned is:

Total points = Points for Gwen + Points for her friends
= 1.67 points + 5 points
= 6.67 points or approximately 7 points (rounded up since we are dealing with whole numbers of points)

Step 5: Initial amount of money = 30 dollars
Amount received as a gift = 16 dollars
Amount spent on the new game = 38 dollars

Step 6: Total amount of money now = Initial amount + Amount received + (Amount spent | negative sign if spent > amount received)

Step 2: Each box contains 6 pieces of chocolate candy. So, the total number of pieces Kaleb originally had is:
14 boxes * 6 pieces/box = 84 pieces

Step 3: Kaleb gave 5 boxes to his brother. Since each box contains 6 pieces of candy, the number of pieces his brother received is:
5 boxes * 6 pieces/box = 30 pieces

Step 4: To find the number of pieces that Kaleb still has, we subtract the pieces that he gave to his brother from the original number of pieces:

                 [/INST] To find out how many baggies Maria can make with the given number of cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in each bag.

First, let's find the total number of cookies Maria has:
- Chocolate chip cookies: 5
- Oatmeal cookies: 19

Total number of cookies = Chocolate chip cookies + Oatmeal cookies
Total number of cookies = 5 + 19
Total number of cookies = 24

Now, we know that Maria puts 8 cookies in each bag. So, to find the number of baggies she can make, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in each bag:

Number of baggies = Total number of cookies / Cookies per bag
Number of baggies = 24 / 8
Number of baggies = 3

However, since she cannot make a fraction of a baggie, Maria can only make 2 full baggies with 8 cookies each, and the remaining 4 cookies will be the start of a third baggie. Therefore, she can make a total of 3 baggies.

                 [/INST] To find out how many pages John would need to store all his baseball cards, we first need to determine how many cards can fit on one page in his binder, and then calculate how many pages are required to hold all the new and old cards.

1. First, let's calculate how many cards can fit on one page since we are given that there are 3 cards per page in the binder.
   { 1 page = 3 cards }

2. Now, to find out how many cards can fit on one page, we just need to divide the total number of cards per page by the number of cards each card holds.
   { Number of cards on one page = Cards per page * Cards in a card }
   Given: Cards per page = 3
   However, since the problem does not mention the size of the baseball cards and only tells us that there are 3 cards per page, we cannot determine how many cards can fit on one page exactly based on this information alone. So, we will assume that each baseball card is of standard size for simplicity.

3. Standard baseball cards have dimensions of approximately 2.125 inches by 3.5 inches. The total area of one standard baseball card is:
   { Area of one card = Height * Width }
   Height = 2.125 inches
   Width = 3.5 inches
   Area of one card = 2.125 inches × 3.5 inches = 7.225 square inches ≈ 7.3 square inches (rounded to one decimal place for simplicity)

4. Since one page in John's binder holds 3 cards, the total area of one page must be 3 times the area of one card:
   { Area of one page = Number of cards * Area per card }
   Area of one page = 3 × 7.3 square inches = 21.9 square inches

5. With this information, we can now calculate how many pages are needed to store all the cards:
   { Number of pages = Total number of cards * Area per card / Area per page }
   With John having 8 new cards and 16 old cards:
   Total number of cards = 8 + 16 = 24 cards
   Number of pages = 24 cards * (7.3 square inches / 21.9 square inches per page)
   ≈ 6.045 pages
   Since we cannot have a fraction of a page, let's round this up to 7 pages to account for the whole cards that will have to fit on each page.

2. Five students left during the year, so we subtract 5 from the initial number of students.
   Students at the beginning of the year = 31
   Students who left = 5
   =====================================
   Students remaining = 31 - 5
                         = 26
3. Eleven new students came to the school during the year, so we add this number to the number of students who remained.
   Students remaining = 26
   New students arrived = 11
   ====================
   Total number of students = 26 + 11

Remaining socks = Initial socks - Socks thrown away
Remaining socks = 33 - 19
Remaining socks = 14
Step 3: John bought 13 new socks. We add these to the remaining socks to find John's current total number of socks.

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups there would be with 4 players in each group, we first need to determine how many players there are in total. We are given that there are 2 new players and 6 returning players.

Total players = New players + Returning players
             = 2 + 6
             = 8

Now we need to find out how many groups can be formed with 4 players in each group.

Number of groups = Total players / Players per group
                = 8 / 4
                = 2

However, since we cannot form exactly half a group from the last player(s), we need to round up the number of groups to ensure all players are included in a group.

Therefore, we need to add 1 more group. For simplicity, let's assume this group will consist of only the remaining players, which is not specified in the problem.

{The final answer is: There will be 3 groups in total.}

However, it's worth noting that according to the information given in the problem, there will actually be only 7 players in the last group with 2 new players and not 4. Thus, the final answer does not fit the information given in the problem exactly.

A correct solution for the given information would be: The school's baseball team had 2 new players and 6 returning players. If the coach put them into groups with 4 players in each group, they could only form 5 groups, with one group consisting of 6 players and the others consisting of 4 players.

                 [/INST]First, we determine how long it takes to paint all 6 rooms. Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the total time required is:

Time for 6 rooms = Rooms painted * Hours per room
= 6 * 5
= 30 hours

Next, since the painter has already painted 2 rooms, we subtract the time already spent:

Time already spent = Rooms painted * Hours per room
= 2 * 5
= 10 hours

Therefore, the remaining time to paint the next 4 rooms is:

Time to paint remaining rooms = Total rooms * Hours per room - Time already spent
= 6 * 5 - 10

                 [/INST] To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each small load, we first need to determine the number of pieces of clothing remaining after the first large load.

Step 1: Find the number of pieces of clothing in the first large load.
48 pieces of clothing in the first large load.

Step 2: Find the number of pieces of clothing in the remaining small loads.
120 (total pieces of clothing) - 48 (pieces in the first large load) = 72 pieces of clothing
72 pieces of clothing divided by 9 small loads = approximately 8 pieces of clothing in each small load.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a piece of clothing, we need to round up or down to get a whole number. Given that 72 is divisible by 9, we can evenly distribute the remaining pieces of clothing into 9 equal small loads without needing to round.

Therefore, there are 8 pieces of clothing in each small load.

Step 2: Calculate how many books can fit on one shelf.
Given that Roger can fit 3 books on one shelf, and we need to find out how many shelves he will need:

Number of shelves = Total number of books /Number of books per shelf

                 [/INST] To find out how many extra flowers Bianca picked, we first need to determine how many flowers she picked in total. We know that she picked 39 tulips and 49 roses.

Total number of flowers = Number of tulips + Number of roses
= 39 + 49
= 88

However, we are told that she only used 81 flowers in her bouquets. This means that she picked some additional flowers beyond the 88 she initially had.

Let's denote the number of extra flowers she picked as x. We know that the total number of flowers she ended up with is 88 + x.

We also know from the problem statement that the total number of flowers she picked was 81. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

88 + x = 81

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. To do this, we can first subtract 88 from both sides, which gives us:

x = -7

However, the fact that we have a negative x means that our initial assumption about the number of extra flowers was incorrect. Instead, it appears that Bianca picked 7 fewer flowers than what we initially thought, not 7 more.

Therefore, the final answer is that Bianca picked 7 fewer flowers than the initially stated 88, so she picked 81 flowers in total.

1. The number of minutes it took Emily to put together each chair is given as 8 minutes per chair. So, the number of minutes it took her to put together all 4 chairs is:
   Minutes to assemble chairs = Number of chairs * Minutes per chair

                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Cody would need to fill up, we need to determine how many sodas he bought in total and then divide that number by the number of sodas that can be held on each shelf.

1. Cody bought 4 regular sodas, so the number of regular sodas is 4.
2. He bought 44 diet sodas, so the number of diet sodas is 44.
3. The total number of sodas Cody bought is the sum of the regular sodas and diet sodas: 4 + 44 = 48.
4. Each shelf can hold 6 sodas.
5. To find out how many shelves Cody would need to fill up, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold: 48 / 6.

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups the debate team can make when splitting into groups of 9, we first need to find out how many people in total there are and then divide by the group size:

Step 1: Determine the total number of team members.
Total team members = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total team members = 26 boys + 46 girls
Total team members = 72

Step 2: Divide the total number of team members by the group size (number of people per group) to find the number of groups.
Number of groups = Total team members / People per group
Number of groups = 72 / 9

Step 3: Calculate the quotient and check for a remainder. Quotient is the number of full groups and remainder is the number of people who would not fit into a complete group (if any).
Number of groups = 8.0
Since there is a decimal point, there is a remainder of 0.8 * 9 = 7.2 ≈ 7 people.

Now we add 1 complete group to the calculated number of groups to account for this remainder.

Step 4: Increase the number of groups by 1 to account for the remainder.
Number of groups = 8 + 1 = 9

The final answer is: {The debate team can make 9 groups with a remainder of 7 people.} However, since the problem asked for the number of groups without considering the remainder, the answer is simply 9 groups.</s>",8,8.0,9.0

                 [/INST] To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we first need to determine how many apples were ordered in total and then subtract the number of apples given to 5 students.

1. The cafeteria ordered 6 red apples.
2. They also ordered 0.15 * 50 = <<0.15*50=7.5; 7.5>>7.5 green apples (since there are 50 green apples in a peck, as assumed in the calculation).
3. So, the total number of apples ordered was 6 (red) + 7.5 (green) = <<6+7.5=13.5; 13.5>>13.5 apples.

Since only 5 students wanted fruit, they received:
1. 5 students * 5 apples per student = <<5*5=25; 25>>25 apples.

The number of extra apples is, therefore:
13.5 (total ordered) - 25 (given to students) = <<13.5-25=-11.5; There are ""-11.5"" extra apples.>>-11.5. However, this answer doesn't make much sense as we cannot have a negative number of apples.

1. We have 9 managers and 15 employees.
2. So the total number of people is: 9 managers + 15 employees = 24 people.

Now that we know the total number of people, we can find out how many people would be on each team if we split them into 8 teams.

Money left = 42 dollars - 10 dollars

Step 3: Find out how many 8 dollar games Mike could buy:

Number of games = Money left / Cost per game

Step 4: Calculate the number of games Mike could buy:

Number of games = (42 dollars - 10 dollars) / 8 dollars

Step 5: Perform the division:

Number of puppies left = 88 - 34
Number of puppies left = 54

Next, we need to determine how many puppies are put into each cage. We're told that each cage holds 6 puppies. Therefore, to find the number of cages needed, we divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage.

Number of cages = Number of puppies left / Number of puppies per cage

`ceiling(9/8) = 1.125 => 2 trips`

2. For the second table, Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time. He needs to carry 7 trays, which is less than 8 trays, so he will make just one trip for the second table.

Points on level 1 = Number of treasures on level 1 * Points per treasure
Points on level 1 = 2 treasures * 7 points
Points on level 1 = 14 points

Step 3: On the second level, she finds 6 treasures. So her points for the second level are:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of files Wendy had after deleting 37 files.
Wendy started with 82 files, and she deleted 37 of them. Therefore, the number of files left on her computer is:

82 (initial files) - 37 (deleted files) = 45 files

Step 2: Determine how many files are in each folder.
Each folder contains 5 files.

Step 3: Determine how many folders Wendy needs to store all her files.
The number of folders needed is equal to the number of files divided by the number of files per folder:

                    question:
                     There school's baseball team had 12 new players , and 44 returning players. If . the coach put them ? into groups with 8 players in each group, how many groups would there be? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many groups the coach can form with 56 players (12 new players + 44 returning players) in each group of 8 players, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players per group.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of players.
Total players = New players + Returning players
Total players = 12 + 44
Total players = 56

Step 2: Divide the total number of players by the number of players per group.
Number of groups = Total players / Players per group
Number of groups = 56 / 8

Step 3: Perform the division operation.
Number of groups = 7.0625

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up or down. In this case, we round up because if we put 7 groups together, we would still have 3 players left over, which is not enough to form a complete group. So, we would need an 8th group to accommodate these extra players.

Step 4: Calculate the number of complete groups.
Number of complete groups = Total players / Players per group
Number of complete groups = 56 / 8
Number of complete groups = 7

Step 5: Determine the number of additional groups needed to accommodate any remaining players.
Additional groups = Remaining players / Players per group
Additional groups = 3 / 8
Additional groups = 0.375

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we round up and add one more group to accommodate all the remaining players.

Step 6: Add the number of complete groups and the additional groups.
Total number of groups = Complete groups + Additional groups
Total number of groups = 7 + 1
Total number of groups = 8

Therefore, the coach can form 8 groups of 8 players each from the school's baseball team. {The final answer is 8 groups}.</s>",7,7.0,8.0

                 [/INST] To find out how many 9-dollar games Will can buy with the money he had left after buying new mower blades, we first need to find out how much money he had left.

Step 1: Find out how much money Will had after buying new mower blades.
Will made 104 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. He spent 41 dollars on new mower blades.

Money left = Total earnings - Cost of mower blades
Money left = 104 dollars - 41 dollars
Money left = 63 dollars

Step 2: Find out how many 9-dollar games Will can buy with the money he had left.

Number of games = Money left / Cost of each game
Number of games = 63 dollars / 9 dollars
Number of games ≈ 7

So, Will can buy approximately 7 nine-dollar games with the money he had left.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many pieces were in the boxes that Dave kept for himself.
12 boxes * 3 pieces/box = 36 pieces

Step 2: Subtract the pieces that Dave gave to his little brother.
36 pieces * total pieces given = 15 pieces (since Dave gave away 5 boxes)
36 pieces - 15 pieces = 21 pieces

The final answer is: Dave had 21 pieces of chocolate candy left.</s>",21,21.0,21.0

                     A waiter ? at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 39 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush he added another 12 customers. If 49 of ? the customers . didn't leave him . a tip, how many customers did leave a tip? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many customers left a tip, we first need to determine the total number of customers the waiter served during the lunch rush.

Step 1: Find the total number of customers the waiter served.
Total number of customers = Customers from the morning (39) + Customers from the lunch rush (12)
Total number of customers = 39 + 12 = 51

Step 2: Determine how many customers didn't leave a tip. We are given that 49 of them didn't tip.

Step 3: Calculate the number of customers who left a tip by subtracting those who didn't tip from the total number of customers.

Customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Customers who didn't tip
Customers who left a tip = 51 - 49

The final answer is: 2 customers left a tip.</s>",2,2.0,2.0

                    question:
                     The cafeteria had 50 apples. For lunch they handed out 5 to students and . decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 5 apples, how many pies could they make? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many pies the cafeteria can make with the remaining apples, we first need to determine how many apples were given to students and how many apples are left for making pies.

1. The cafeteria had 50 apples.
2. They gave 5 apples to each student, so they handed out a total of 5 × ___ = 5 × Number_of_students apples.
3. Subtracting the apples given to students from the total number of apples, we find that they have _____ apples left for making pies.
4. Each pie uses 5 apples, so the number of pies they can make is ______ / 5.

Let's calculate the number of students:
1. For each student, they handed out 5 apples.
2. Therefore, the number of students that received apples is 50 apples / 5 apples per student = 10 students.

Now we can calculate the number of pies they can make:
1. They have 50 apples minus the 5 apples given to each student (5 ×10=50), so that leaves them with 50-50=0 apples for making pies.
2. However, the question states that they did decide to use the rest of the apples to make pies, which contradicts the information that they have no apples left.
3. Let's assume there was a mistake in the problem, or the information about the apples left for pies was not provided and instead calculated from the number of apples they initially had.
4. Since each pie takes 5 apples, the cafeteria could make 50 apples / 5 apples per pie = ___, but due to the inconsistency in the information, it is unclear how many pies they could actually make.

{The final answer is: It is unclear how many pies they could make due to inconsistent information.}</s>",9,9.0,5.0

Step 2: By March, Oliver had spent 4 dollars, so he had 33 - 4 = <<33-4=30>>30 dollars left.

Step 3: Oliver received an additional 32 dollars from his mom.

Step 4: To find the total amount of money Oliver has, we add the money he had left in March to the amount he received from his mom: 30 + 32 = <<30+32=62>>62 dollars.

                     Zoe was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 8 boxes of clothing and inside each box . there were ; 4 scarves and 6 mittens. ! How many pieces of winter clothing did Zoe have total? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many pieces of winter clothing Zoe has in total, we need to find out how many items are in each box and then multiply that number by the number of boxes.

First, we know that each box contains 4 scarves and 6 mittens. So, the number of items in each box is the number of scarves plus the number of mittens.

Number of items per box = Scarves per box + Mittens per box
= 4 + 6
= 10

Now, we know that Zoe has 8 boxes of clothing, so we can find the total number of pieces of winter clothing by multiplying the number of items in each box by the number of boxes.

Total number of pieces of winter clothing = Items per box * Number of boxes
= 10 * 8
= 80

So, {The final answer is: Zoe had a total of 80 pieces of winter clothing}.</s>",80,80.0,80.0

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identifying the cost of one trick deck.
Each trick deck costs Frank 7 dollars.

Step 2: Calculating the cost of decks bought by Frank.
Frank bought 3 trick decks, so the cost of decks bought by Frank = Cost per deck * Number of decks
Cost of decks bought by Frank = 7 dollars/deck * 3 decks = 21 dollars

Step 3: Calculating the cost of decks bought by Frank's friend.
Frank's friend bought 2 trick decks, so the cost of decks bought by Frank's friend = Cost per deck * Number of decks
Cost of decks bought by Frank's friend = 7 dollars/deck * 2 decks = 14 dollars

Step 4: Adding the cost of the decks bought by both Frank and his friend.
Total amount spent = Cost of decks bought by Frank + Cost of decks bought by Frank's friend
Total amount spent = 21 dollars + 14 dollars = 35 dollars

                    question:
                     Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts . before school. . If ; he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not : wash? 
                 [/INST] To find the number of shirts that Sam did not wash, we first need to determine how many shirts he did wash before school started, and then subtract that number from the total number of shirts he had to wash.

Total number of shirts = Short sleeve shirts + Long sleeve shirts
Total number of shirts = 40 + 23
Total number of shirts = 63

Number of short sleeve shirts Sam washed = 40
Number of long sleeve shirts Sam washed = Not given

Number of shirts Sam washed in total = Number of short sleeve shirts + Number of long sleeve shirts he washed
Number of shirts Sam washed = 40 + Number of long sleeve shirts he washed

Number of shirts Sam didn't wash = Total number of shirts - Number of shirts he washed
Number of shirts Sam didn't wash = 63 - (40 + Number of long sleeve shirts he washed)
Number of shirts Sam didn't wash = 23 + Number of long sleeve shirts he didn't wash

Based on the problem statement, we know that Sam had washed 29 shirts by the time school started. Let's determine how many long sleeve shirts were among those 29:

Total number of shirts Sam washed = 29
Number of short sleeve shirts Sam washed = 40 - Number of short sleeve shirts remaining
Number of short sleeve shirts Sam washed = 40 - (40 - Number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash)
Number of short sleeve shirts Sam washed = 40 - 4 + Number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash
Number of short sleeve shirts Sam washed = 44 - Number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash

Since the total number of shirts he washed was 29 and the number of short sleeve shirts he washed was 44 - Number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash, we can write the following equation:

29 = 44 - Number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash

Solving the equation, we find that:

Number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash = 44 - 29 = 15

Now, we can find the number of long sleeve shirts he didn't wash using the information we have:

Number of long sleeve shirts he didn't wash = Total number of shirts he didn't wash - Number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash
Number of long sleeve shirts he didn't wash = 23 + Number of long sleeve shirts he washed - Number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash
Number of long sleeve shirts he didn't wash = 23 + 29 - 15

So, the final answer is:
{The final answer is 35 long sleeve shirts that Sam did not wash.}</s>",34,34.0,35.0

                    question:
                     A waiter had 47 : customers to wait on. If 41 customers left and he got another 20 customers, how many customers would he have? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: The waiter had 47 customers to begin with.

Step 2: 41 customers left, so the number of customers the waiter has now is the initial number minus the number of customers who left.

Mathematically, this can be represented as: Number of customers = Initial number of customers - Customers who left

Number of customers = 47 - 41

Step 3: Subtract 41 from 47 to find the number of customers the waiter has after the first group left:

Number of customers = 47 - 41
Number of customers = 6

Step 4: The waiter then gets another 20 customers. To find the final number of customers the waiter is serving:

Final number of customers = Current number of customers + New customers

Final number of customers = 6 + 20

Step 5: Add the current number of customers to the number of new customers:

Final number of customers = 6 + 20
