                    question:
                     Paige ! had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how ; many songs ? does she have on her mp3 player? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Paige started with 11 songs on her mp3 player.

Step 2: She deleted 9 old songs, so the number of songs on her mp3 player decreased by 9.

Songs before deletion = 11
Songs after deletion = Songs before deletion - 9
Songs after deletion = 11 - 9 = 2 songs

Step 3: After deleting old songs, she added 8 new songs to her mp3 player.

Songs on mp3 player = Songs after deletion + New songs
Songs on mp3 player = 2 + 8 = 10 songs

Step 4: The final answer:
{The final answer is: Paige has 10 songs on her mp3 player.}</s>",10

                 [/INST]First, let's find out how many students in total tried out for the basketball team. We have 39 girls and 4 boys, so the total number of students who tried out is:

39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students

Next, we know that 26 students were called back. So, the number of students who didn't get called back is:

Total students who tried out - Students who got called back = Students who didn't make the cut

43 students (total) - 26 students ( whom made the cut) = 17 students

{The final answer is 17 students didn't make the cut}.</s>",17

Step 2: The total number of enemies in the level is 11.
Step 3: We have destroyed all but 3 of the enemies, so we have not defeated 8 enemies.
Step 4: To find out how many points we have earned, we need to find the number of enemies we have defeated and multiply that by the points earned per enemy.
Step 5: We have defeated 8 enemies (total number of enemies - number of enemies we have not defeated).

                 [/INST] To find out how many shirts Ned did not wash, we first need to find out how many shirts he had and how many he managed to wash before school started.

1. Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts. In total, he had to wash:
   Total shirts = 9 short sleeve shirts + 21 long sleeve shirts = 2 + 21 = 23 shirts (per sleeve, we don't distinguish between short and long sleeve shirts)

2. Ned managed to wash 29 shirts before school started.

3. To find out how many shirts Ned did not wash, we can subtract the shirts he washed from the total number of shirts he had to wash:
   {The final answer is: 23 shirts (in total) - 29 shirts (washed) = -6 shirts}

   However, we cannot have a negative number of shirts. This indicates an error in the given information, since 29 washed shirts is more than the 23 shirts Ned had to wash.</s>",1

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of people who actually attended the luncheon.
47 people were invited, but 7 didn't show up, so the number of people who attended is:
47 (invited) - 7 (no-shows) = 40 people

Step 2: Determine the number of tables they need based on how many people each table can accommodate.
Each table can seat 5 people, so the number of tables they need is:
40 (attendees) / 5 (seats per table) = 8 tables (with a remainder of 0)

However, when rounded up, they would need 9 tables, but they couldn't make a table with just one additional person, making the table inefficient. Hence, they would need to round up to the nearest whole number, which gives them 9 tables.

{The final answer is: They need 9 tables to accommodate all the attendees}</s>",8
" Tom had 5 books. If he sold 4 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books : would : Tom have? ","<s> [INST]

                    question:
                     Tom had 5 books. If he sold 4 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books : would : Tom have? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Tom initially had 5 books.

Step 2: He sold 4 books, so Tom now has 5 (initial books) - 4 (sold books) = <b>1 book</b>.

Step 3: With the money earned from selling the 4 books, Tom bought 38 new books. Let's denote the price of each new book as 'p'. 

Step 4: Tom bought 38 new books, which cost 38 * p.

Step 5: Since Tom used the money from selling the 4 books to buy the new books, we need to find out how much he made from selling the books: Tom sold 4 books at p each, so the total amount of money he earned was 4 * p.

Step 6: Tom spent that money on new books, so we can write the equation: 

4 * p = 38 * p

Step 7: Let's solve for 'p': Divide both sides by (4-38) which equals -34, since 38 is a positive number, it is not possible to divide by a negative number, thus the problem statement is incorrect as it fails to comply with mathematical rules.

Therefore, the problem as stated cannot be solved based on the information provided. {The final answer is: The problem statement is incorrect and cannot be solved.}</s>",39

                    question:
                    ,  For a birthday party Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 9 : on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up? ! 
                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Jerry will need to fill up, we first need to determine how many sodas he bought in total and then divide that number by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Total number of sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
Total number of sodas = 41 + 22
Total number of sodas = 63

Now, let's find out how many shelves are needed:

Shelves needed = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
Shelves needed = 63 / 9

To get the whole number of shelves, we can round up since Jerry won't be able to fit a fraction of a shelf.

Shelves needed = ⌈63/9⌋
Shelves needed = ⌊63.3333333⌋ (Round down toward zero)
Shelves needed = 7

However, the question specifies that there are only 9 slices on each shelf. This is a contradiction, as it indicates there is room for 9 sodas, but the calculation shows that 7 shelves are needed to hold all the sodas. This inconsistency might be a result of a mistake in the problem statement, and it's impossible to provide a definitive solution without further clarification.

Based on the given information in the problem statement, the final answer is: Jerry would need 7 shelves to store all his sodas (with 9 sodas on each shelf). However, there's an inconsistency in the problem statement, and the final answer may not be valid.</s>",7

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many seeds Emily planted in total, excluding the seeds she planted in the small gardens.

Emily started with 41 seeds. She planted 29 seeds in the large garden, so:

Seeds planted in the large garden = 29
Seeds left = 41 - 29 = 12 seeds

Step 2: Determine how many seeds Emily planted in each small garden.

Emily put 4 seeds in each small garden, so:

Seeds planted in one small garden = 4

Step 3: Calculate how many small gardens Emily has by dividing the number of remaining seeds by the number of seeds she plants in each small garden.

Number of small gardens = Seeds left / Seeds per small garden
Number of small gardens = 12 / 4
Number of small gardens = 3

However, we made an error in our calculation. Since Emily had 41 seeds initially and planted 29 in the large garden and 4 in each of the two small gardens, she should have had 6 seeds left over. To account for this, we should divide the number of remaining seeds by (number of seeds per small garden - remaining seeds):

Step 3 (correct):

Number of small gardens = Seeds left / (Seeds per small garden - Remaining seeds)
Number of small gardens = 6 / (4 - 2)
Number of small gardens = 6 / 2
Number of small gardens = 3

{The final answer is: Emily had 3 small gardens.}</s>",3

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of candy pieces Emily received.
Emily received 5 pieces from neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister.
Total candy = 5 (from neighbors) + 13 (from older sister)
Total candy = 18 pieces

Step 2: Determine how many pieces of candy Emily eats in one day.
Emily eats 9 pieces a day.

Step 3: Calculate how long the candy will last her.
Days until no more candy = Total candy / Pieces eaten per day
Days until no more candy = 18 / 9

Step 4: Perform the calculation.
Days until no more candy = 2 days (approximately)

1. We know that there are 82 books to put away initially.
2. A librarian takes 10 books, so Mike is left with 72 books (82 total books - 10 taken away).
3. Mike can fit 9 books on one shelf.
4. To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the total number of books he has to the number of books that can fit on one shelf (72 books / 9 books/shelf).
5. The calculation comes out to be 8 shelves (round up to the nearest whole number since Mike can't have a fraction of a shelf).

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many pictures Nancy took during her vacation in total. We know she took 49 pictures at the zoo and 8 pictures at the museum. So,

Total pictures taken = Pictures at the zoo + Pictures at the museum
Total pictures taken = 49 + 8
Total pictures taken = 57

Step 2: Next, we need to find out how many pictures she deleted. According to the problem, Nancy deleted 38 pictures. So,

Number of deleted pictures = 38

Step 3: To find out how many pictures Nancy still has, we simply subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures taken during her vacation. So,

Total pictures remaining = Total pictures taken - Number of deleted pictures
Total pictures remaining = 57 - 38
Total pictures remaining = 19

1. We know that it takes 8 hours to install one window.
2. Since 8 windows have already been installed, to find out how long it took to install these windows, we multiply the number of windows installed by the time it takes to install one window: 8 windows × 8 hours/window = 64 hours
3. Now, we know that there are 14 windows in total, and 8 of them have already been installed. Therefore, there are still 6 windows left to be installed.
4. Similarly, to find out how long it takes to install the remaining 6 windows, we multiply the number of remaining windows by the time it takes to install one window: 6 windows × 8 hours/window = 48 hours

                 [/INST] Step 1: We start with the number of oranges in the bin which is given as 40.

Step 2: Next, we are informed that they threw away 25 of the old oranges. So, we subtract 25 from the initial number of oranges in the bin.

Initial number of oranges = 40
Oranges thrown away = 25

Difference = Initial number of oranges - Oranges thrown away
Difference = 40 - 25
Difference = 15

Step 3: We are then told that they added 21 new oranges to the bin. So, we add the number of new oranges to the difference from the previous step.

New oranges = 21

Sum = Difference + New oranges
Sum = 15 + 21
Sum = 36

Step 4: Therefore, the total number of oranges in the bin after throwing away some old ones and adding new ones is 36.

The final answer is: There are 36 oranges in the bin.</s>",36

Step 3: Each customer who left a tip paid $3 in tip.
Step 4: To find the total amount of tip money earned by the waiter, we simply multiply the number of tip-giving customers by the amount of tip each one left: Money earned = Number of tip-giving customers × Tip amount
Step 5: Substituting the values from steps 2 and 3 into step 4, we get: Money earned = 2 × $3 = $6

The chef had 9 wings cooked before the group arrived. He then cooked 7 more to make enough for the group. So the chef cooked a total of 9 + 7 = <ins>16</ins> chicken wings for the group of 4 friends.

Since each person in the group received the same amount of chicken wings, we can find out how many wings each person got by dividing the total number of wings the chef cooked by the number of people in the group.

So the number of wings each person got is 16 ÷ 4 = <ins>4</ins>.

Therefore, each person in the group received 4 chicken wings.

Next, we need to find out how many lawns John actually mowed. He had 15 lawns in total, but forgot to mow 7 of them. So, he mowed:

15 lawns (total) - 7 lawns (forgotten) = 8 lawns (mowed)

Now, let's calculate how much money John earned for mowing the 8 lawns:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the total number of puppies at the shelter.
The shelter initially had 5 puppies, and then 35 more were brought in. So, the total number of puppies is 5 + 35 = <<5+35=40>>40.

Step 2: Determine how many puppies are adopted each day.
We're told that 8 puppies are adopted each day.

Step 3: Calculate how long it will take to adopt out all the puppies.
To find out how long it takes to adopt out all the puppies, we divide the total number of puppies by the number adopted per day: 
Total number of puppies / Puppies adopted per day = Time in days.

So, the time it takes to adopt out all the puppies is 40 / 8 = <<40/8=5>>5 days. {The final answer is 5 days.}</s>",5

                 [/INST] To find the cost of the meal for the group of 13 people, we first need to determine how many adults and kids are in the group based on the given information.

Given:
- Number of people: 13
- Number of kids: 9

We know that in this group, 9 people are kids and so the remaining 4 people must be adults.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the meal for the adults and kids separately, and then find the total cost for the group.

Cost for adults:
- Number of adults: 4
- Cost per adult meal: $7

Cost for adults = Number of adults * Cost per adult meal
Cost for adults = 4 * $7
Cost for adults = $28

Cost for kids:
- Number of kids: 9
- Cost per kid meal: free

Since kids eat free, their cost is zero dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost for the group:

Total cost = Cost for adults + Cost for kids
Total cost = $28 + $0
Total cost = $28

The final answer is: It would cost $28 for the group of 13 people to eat at the restaurant.</s>",28

Rachel found 5 treasures on the first level and 2 treasures on the second level.

Step 2: Determine the points Rachel earned for the treasures found on each level.
Rachel earns 9 points for each treasure.

Step 3: Calculate the points Rachel earned on each level.
Points earned on the first level = Number of treasures on the first level * Points per treasure
Points earned on the first level = 5 treasures * 9 points/treasure
Points earned on the first level = 45 points

Points earned on the second level = Number of treasures on the second level * Points per treasure
Points earned on the second level = 2 treasures * 9 points/treasure
Points earned on the second level = 18 points

Step 4: Add the points earned on each level to find Rachel's total score.

                 [/INST] First, let's determine the total number of customers the waiter had to serve. He had 26 customers during the non-rush period, and then 27 more during the lunch rush, so:

Total customers = 26 (non-rush) + 27 (rush) = 53

Next, we need to find out how many customers didn't leave a tip. We're told that 27 of them didn't tip, so:

Customers without tips = 27

To find out how many customers did leave a tip, we subtract the number of customers who didn't tip from the total number of customers:

Customers with tips = Total customers - Customers without tips
                               = 53 - 27

The store had 17 bears in stock, and they received a shipment with 10 bears.
Total number of bears = 17 (in stock) + 10 (shipment) = 27 bears.

Step 2: Determine the number of bears that can be placed on one shelf.
Each shelf holds 9 bears.

Step 3: Determine the number of shelves needed to hold all the bears.
Number of shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears per shelf:
Number of shelves = 27 / 9 = 3 with a remainder of 1.

Since they cannot have a shelf with only one bear, they will need an additional shelf for the remaining bear.

                 [/INST] To find the total number of books Gwen has, we need to find out how many books are on each type of shelf and then multiply that by the number of shelves for each type.

First, let's find out how many books are on each shelf of mystery books:
Number of books per shelf (mystery) = Number of books wanted per shelf
Number of books per shelf (mystery) = 4

Next, we can find out how many shelves Gwen has for mystery books and multiply that by the number of books per shelf to find the total number of mystery books:
Number of shelves (mystery) = Number of shelves
Number of shelves (mystery) = 5
Total mystery books = Number of shelves (mystery) * Number of books per shelf (mystery)
Total mystery books = 5 * 4
Total mystery books = 20

Now, we'll do the same thing for the picture books. We already know there are 3 shelves for picture books.

Number of books per shelf (picture) = Number of books wanted per shelf
Number of books per shelf (picture) = 4

Total picture books = Number of shelves (picture) * Number of books per shelf (picture)
Total picture books = 3 * 4
Total picture books = 12

Finally, we can add the total number of mystery books and picture books to find the grand total:

1. Wendy uploaded a total of 79 pictures to Facebook.
2. She put 44 pictures into one album, which leaves us with:
   Total number of pictures = 79
   Pictures in one album = 44
   Remaining pictures = 79 - 44 = 35
3. Wendy put the remaining 35 pictures into 5 different albums. So, we need to find out how many pictures are in each of these 5 albums:
4. To find the number of pictures in each of the 5 albums, we divide the remaining number of pictures by the number of albums:

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups the schools debate team could make when splitting into groups of 9, first find out the total number of people on the team:

Total number of people = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of people = 0.5 * Boys + Girls
Total number of people = 0.5 * 5 + 40
Total number of people = 3 + 40
Total number of people = 43

Now, divide the total number of people by the size of each group to find out the number of groups:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Group size
Number of groups = 43 / 9

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we cannot fully split the team into groups of 9 without some members being left out. But we can calculate the number of complete groups and the number of leftover members.

Complete groups = Total number of people / Group size
Complete groups = 43 / 9
Complete groups ≈ 4.74

We can form 4 complete groups (ignoring the decimal part), and then one additional group will consist of the remaining 3 team members:

{The final answer is: They can make 5 groups.}

Therefore, the debate team can make a total of 5 groups when splitting into groups of 9.</s>",5

                 [/INST] To find out how many cats the pet store has left after selling 10 cats, we first need to determine how many of each type of cat were sold. Let's assume that all the cats sold were house cats for the sake of this example (which is not likely given the initial numbers, but it simplifies the calculation).

1. Initially, there were 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats, so there were a total of 18 cats.

2. They sold 10 cats during the sale.

3. If all the cats sold were house cats, then 10 was the number of house cats sold.

4. Therefore, subtract the number of house cats sold from the initial number of house cats to find out how many house cats remain: 5 (initial) - 10 (sold) = -5. This answer is not realistic, so let's assume that some siamese cats were sold instead.

5. Since we don't know how many siamese cats were sold, the calculation cannot be accurately determined without that information.

                 [/INST] To find out how many packages Megan can make after her brother Todd ate 43 cupcakes, we first need to determine how many cupcakes Megan had left after her brother ate his share.

1. Megan baked 71 cupcakes.
2. Todd ate 43 of them, so Megan had 七一: 71 - 43 = 28 remaining.

Now, knowing that Megan puts 7 cupcakes in each package, we can divide the number of remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per package to find out how many packages she can make.

3. Packages = Remaining cupcakes / Cupcakes per package
4. Packages = 28 / 7
5. Packages ≈ 4.0. Since Megan cannot make a fraction of a package, she will make 4 full packages and still have 2 leftover cupcakes.

{The final answer is: Megan can make 4 full packages and will have 2 leftover cupcakes.}</s>",4

Step 2: He threw away 3 old socks, so he subtracted 3 from the number of socks he had.

10 socks (Sam started with) - 3 socks (threw away) = 7 socks

Step 3: Sam bought 36 new socks.

Step 4: To find the total number of socks Sam has now, we add the number of socks he had after throwing away the old ones to the number of new socks he bought.

7 socks (old socks) + 36 socks (new socks) = 43 socks

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many bouquets Wendy made with the flowers that didn't wilt.
- We know she picked 103 flowers and each bouquet has 8 flowers.
- First, let's find out how many bouquets she made before the wilting.
  Bouquets made = Total flowers picked / Flowers per bouquet
  Bouquets made = 103 / 8 = 13.125 (Let's round down since she can't make a part of a bouquet)
  So, she made 13 bouquets.

Step 2: Determine how many bouquets she can still make with the flowers that didn't wilt.
- Since 47 flowers wilted, she had 56 flowers left.
- She can make 1 bouquet with 8 flowers, so we'll find out how many bouquets she can make with the remaining flowers.
  Bouquets = Total flowers left / Flowers per bouquet
  Bouquets = 56 / 8 = 7 (She can make 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers)

The final answer is: Wendy could still make 7 bouquets for the wedding.</s>",7

                 [/INST] Step 1: Adam started with 48 books.
Step 2: He sold 19 books, so we subtract 19 from the initial 48.

Adam_initial_books = 48
Books_sold = 19

Step 3: Adam used the money from selling the books to buy 38 new books.

Money_from_selling = Price_per_book * Number_of_books_sold
= Price_per_book * 19

Where Price_per_book is the price Adam received for each book when selling them.

Step 4: We can find the new number of books Adam has by adding the new books he bought to the remaining ones he had after selling the old ones.

New_books = Remaining_books + Books_bought_with_money_from_selling
= Remaining_books + 38

Let's assume Price_per_book = $5:

Money_from_selling = $5 * 19 = $95

Then,

Remaining_books = 48 - 19 = 29

Adam's final number of books = 29 + 38 = 67

                 [/INST] To find out how many vans are needed for Nancy's class to go on the field trip to the zoo, we need to calculate the total number of people and then divide that number by the capacity of each van.

First, let's find the total number of people in the class:
- There are 12 students, so there are 12 people for students
- There are 3 adults, so there are 3 people for adults
- The total number of people is: 12 (students) + 3 (adults) = 15 people

Now, we know that each van can hold 5 people, so we need to find how many vans are required to carry the entire class:
- Divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van: 15 people / 5 people/van = 3 vans

However, since we cannot rent a fraction of a van, we would need to round up to the nearest whole number, as each van must carry all of the students and teachers in the class.

1. Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. In total, Tom bought:
   { Tom bought 4 regular sodas + 52 diet sodas = 56 sodas }

2. Each shelf can hold 7 sodas. So, the number of shelves Tom needs is:
   { Number of shelves = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf }
   { Number of shelves = 56 sodas / 7 sodas/shelf }

For Table 1 with 20 trays:
Number of trips for Table 1 = Total number of trays / Capacity per trip
Number of trips for Table 1 = 20 trays / 4 trays per trip

So, Luke makes 5 trips to Table 1 (rounded up due to the remainder of the division).

For Table 2 with 16 trays:
Number of trips for Table 2 = Total number of trays / Capacity per trip
Number of trips for Table 2 = 16 trays / 4 trays per trip

So, Luke makes 4 trips to Table 2.

Now, we need to add up the number of trips for both tables to find the total number of trips Luke makes.

Total number of trips = Trips to Table 1 + Trips to Table 2
Total number of trips = 5 + 4
Total number of trips = 9

Step 1: Find the total number of good carrots picked.
Total good carrots = Carrots picked by Vanessa + Carrots picked by her mom
Total good carrots = 17 (Vanessa) + 14 (Her mom) = 31

Step 2: Find the number of bad carrots.
We know that only 24 good carrots were present in the garden. So, the number of bad carrots must have been:

Bad carrots = Total carrots (good and bad) - Good carrots
Bad carrots = 24 (good carrots) - 31 (good carrots picked)

Note: The above calculation shows that fewer good carrots were picked than were available in the garden. However, the problem states that only 24 good carrots were present. This indicates that possibly some of the picked carrots were bad and were not included in the count of the good carrotons.

Therefore, based on the information given in the problem, we cannot accurately determine the number of bad carrots. The number of bad carrots is not explicitly stated in the problem.

So, Tiffany needs to make 9 more brownies for her party.

Since the amount of flour used for one brownie is given as 8 cups, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for all 17 brownies as follows:

Total cups of flour needed = Cups per brownie * Number of brownies

Step 1: Subtract the number of candies Bianca ate from the total number of candies she received.

Total candies = 78
Candies eaten = 30

Remaining candies = Total candies - Candies eaten

Remaining candies = 78 - 30

Step 2: Divide the number of remaining candies by the number of candies in each pile to find out how many piles can be made.

5 friends * 8 lives/friend = 40 lives

Step 2: Then, 2 more players join the game, so now there are a total of 7 friends in the game. Each new friend also has 8 lives, so we add their total number of lives to the initial amount:
7 friends * 8 lives/friend = 56 lives

Step 3: The total number of lives for all the friends in the game is the sum of the initial number of lives and the new lives:

Since there are 11 people in total and 2 of them are kids, there are 9 adults.
Each adult meal costs $8.
So, the cost for the adults is: 9 adults * $8/adult = $72

Step 2: Since kids eat for free, there's no additional cost for their meals.

Step 3: Add the cost of the adult meals to the cost of the kids' meals to find the total cost for the group.

                     Roger had 25 books. If ; he sold 21 of them and ! used the money he earned to buy 30 new books, how many books would Roger have? 
                 [/INST] To find the number of books Roger has after buying new books with the money earned from selling old ones, let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Find out how many books Roger has left after selling 21 books.
Initial number of books = 25
Books sold = 21

Difference = Initial number of books - Books sold
= 25 - 21
= 4

So, Roger has 4 books left after selling 21.

Step 2: Find out how many new books Roger bought with the money earned from selling 21 books.
We don't have the exact cost of each book or the selling price, but since he used all the money to buy 30 new books, we'll assume the cost and selling price to be equal for simplicity. Let's denote the cost/selling price of each book as 'p'.

Money earned from selling books = 21 books * p

Money spent on buying new books = 30 books * p

Since he spent all the money earned from selling the old books on the new ones, we have:

Money earned = Money spent

=> 21books * p = 30books * p
=> (21books) = (30books)

This equation is not possible, as 21 is not equal to 30. Let's assume the amount Roger earned from selling 21 books is 'x'.

Money earned = x
Money spent = 30p

Since money earned = money spent, we have:

x = 30p
=> x = 30 * p

So, the amount Roger earned from selling 21 books is 30 times the selling price of each book.

Step 3: Find out how many new books Roger bought with the amount earned from selling old books.
New books purchased = Money earned from selling old books / Cost of each new book

Cost of each new book = p (we assumed)

=> New books purchased = (30 * p) / p
=> New books purchased = 30

So, Roger bought 30 new books.

Step 4: Find out how many books Roger has in total after buying new ones.
Books from selling old ones = 4
Books from new purchases = 30

=> Total number of books = Books from selling old ones + Books from new purchases
=> Total number of books = 4 + 30
=> Total number of books = 34

Therefore, {The final answer is: Roger has 34 books in total}.</s>",34

48 new players + 6 returning players = 54 players

Now, we know that each group consists of 6 players. To find out how many groups there are, we divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group:

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the number of folders Nancy ended up with:

1. Nancy had 80 files in total.
2. She deleted 31 files, which leaves her with 80 - 31 = <ins>49</ins> files remaining.
3. Nancy put the rest of her files into folders, each containing 7 files.
4. To find out how many folders she ended up with, divide the number of files she has left by the number of files per folder: 49 files / 7 files/folder = <ins>7</ins>folders. (This result does not make sense with the given information since 7 files go into a folder).
5. However, the question asks how many folders she ended up with, not how many files are in each folder. Therefore, let's calculate the number of folders based on the given information: Since Nancy had 80 files and put the rest into folders with 7 files, then the number of folders must be equal to the quotient of the total number of files by the number of files per folder, which is 80 files / 7 files/folder = <ins>11.4</ins>. Since it's impossible to have a decimal number of folders, there might be a mistake in the given data. We assume it was an error and the correct information is 80 files / 7 files/folder = 11 folders.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Luke starts with 39 games.
Step 2: He sells 19 games, so the number of games left with him is 39 - 19 = 18 games.
Step 3: He packs the rest of the games into boxes, each containing 4 games.
Step 4: To find out how many boxes he used, we divide the number of games left by the number of games per box, and round up to the nearest whole number to account for the entire collection of games.

Boxes needed = (Number of games) / (Games per box)

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of students who were picked for the trivia teams.
Given that there are 65 ! students and 17 of them were not picked, then the number of students who were picked is:

Total students - Students not picked = Students picked
65 ! - 17 = 64 ! students

Step 2: Determine how many students will be in each group.
Given that the rest of the students were put into 8 groups, we can find the number of students in each group by dividing the number of students picked by the number of groups:

Students per group = Students picked / Number of groups
Students per group = 64 ! / 8

Step 3: Perform the division.
We need to calculate the quotient of 64! and 8. Since division by a factorial is not easily calculable, we will assume that each group gets an approximately equal number of students.

To obtain a close approximation, let's calculate the value of 64!/8 in a less formal way.

First, calculate 64!:

64! = 64 × 63 × 62 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1

Since 8 divides 64 exactly, groups of students will have the same size as there are factors in the divisor. So, we count the number of factors of 8 in 64!.

64! = 8 × (2^6) × (3!)^2 × ... × (7!)^2 × (11!)^2 × ...

Now, calculate the number of groups with 8 factors:

4! = 2^2 × 3!

We have (6!) factors of 6 in 64!.
The number of groups with 8 factors is 6!/((4!)^2).

Approximate Result:
Students per group ≈ (6!/(4!)^2) = 792 × (1/128) ≈ 6.11 × 64 = 38.92 ≈ 39 students

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a student, one group will have fewer students, and the rest will have 39 students:

Final Answer: With one under-sized group and the remaining groups containing 39 students, the problem has an approximate solution. So, {The answer is: 38 students in one group and 39 students in the remaining 7 groups}. This approximation, while not exact, should give a close representation of the situation at hand.</s>",6

                 [/INST] To find out how many pictures were in each album, we first need to determine how many pictures were in the 4 albums aside from the one with 10 pictures.

First, we know that Isabel uploaded a total of 25 pictures. She put 10 pictures into one album. Therefore, the remaining pictures must be distributed among 5 albums.

Let x be the number of pictures in each album aside from the one with 10 pictures. Since there are 5 albums having the same number of pictures as the one with 10 pictures, we have:

Number of pictures in 5 albums = 5 * x

Total number of pictures = 10 (in the first album) + 5 * x (in the remaining 5 albums)

Substituting the value of the total number of pictures, we have:

10 + 5 * x = 25

Next, we'll solve for x:

5 * x = 15
x = 3

Therefore, each of the 4 remaining albums contains 3 pictures.

59 (total pieces) - 32 (large load) = 27 pieces

Next, we are told that these pieces will be divided into 9 equal loads. So, to find the number of pieces in each small load, we simply divide the total number of pieces for small loads by the number of loads:

Number of pieces in each small load = Total pieces for small loads / Number of small loads

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the cost of roses and daisies separately.
Since each rose costs $6, and Katie bought 5 roses, the cost of roses is:
Cost of roses = Number of roses * Price per rose
= 5 * $6
= $30

Similarly, since each daisy also costs $6, and Katie bought 5 daisies, the cost of daisies is:
Cost of daisies = Number of daisies * Price per daisy
= 5 * $6
= $30

Step 2: Find the total amount spent by Katie.
Total amount spent = Cost of roses + Cost of daisies

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Victor bought a total of 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books at the school book fair.
2. The total number of books he bought is 32 (adventure) + 37 (mystery) = 69 books.
3. We're told that 16 of those books were used, so we need to find out how many books are still new.
4. First, let's determine how many adventure and mystery books were used: 16 total books ÷ 1 book per genre = 16 books ÷ 2 genres = 8 adventure books and 8 mystery books.
5. Now, let's find out how many books are still new. We do this by subtracting the number of used books from the total number of books bought: 69 books total - 8 adventure used - 8 mystery used = 53 books new.

{The final answer is: Victor bought 53 new books.}</s>",53

1. Initially, there were 4 friends playing the video game.
2. Then, 5 more players joined the game.
3. Each player has 3 lives.

To find the total number of lives, we first need to determine how many players there are in total now.

The number of players = Initial number of players + Number of new players
= 4 friends + 5 more players
= 9 players

Now that we know the total number of players, we can calculate the total number of lives.

                 [/INST] Let's walk through this problem step by step:

1. Kaleb started with 12 dollars.
2. He spent 8 dollars on a new game.
3. To find out how many 2-dollar toys he could buy, we need to find the difference between his initial amount and the amount he spent on the game.
4. The difference is: $12 (Initial amount) - $8 (Amount spent on game) = $4
5. Since 2-dollar toys cost $2 each, we can't buy a full toy with the remaining $4, but we can calculate how many we could buy if we had the full $2 value.
6. To find that, we simply divide the remaining money by the price of a single toy: $4 ÷ $2 = 2 toys (but since we can't buy a fraction of a toy, Kaleb can only buy 1 more toy with the $4 he has left).

Therefore, the final answer is: {Kaleb could buy 2 toys if he could afford the full price, but since he can only buy 1 more toy with the $4 he has left.}</s>",2

                 [/INST] To find out how many folders Katie ended up with, we first need to find out how many files she has left after deleting some of them. Then we divide that number by the number of files in each folder to find the number of folders.

1. Katie had 85 files. She deleted 40 of them, so there are now 45 files left (85 - 40 = 45).
2. Each folder contains 5 files. So, to find the number of folders, we divide the number of files by the number of files in each folder.

{The final answer is: 45 files ÷ 5 files/folder = 9 folders}

However, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement. If Katie had 85 files and deleted 40, then she should have had 45 files left. But the problem statement says that she put the rest into folders with 5 files in each one. This implies that there are 40 files (5 files/folder × 8 folders) in the folders, which contradicts the information given at the beginning of the problem. If the problem statement is correct, then there should be 8 folders with 5 files each, and the total number of files would be 40, which is a different answer from the one we obtained.

Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive answer without resolving the inconsistency in the problem statement.

We recommend checking the problem statement for any potential errors and verifying that all given information is accurate before attempting to solve it.</s>",9

                 [/INST] To determine how many shelves Oliver will need, we first need to find out how many books he is left with after the librarian takes 10 books.

1. There are a total of 46 books to be put away.
2. The librarian takes 10 books, leaving Oliver with the remaining books.
3. So, Oliver is left with: 46 (total books) - 10 (books taken) = 36 books
4. Each shelf can hold 4 books.
5. To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, we divide the total number of books he is left with by the number of books that can be put on each shelf.

                 [/INST] To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we first need to find out how many birds are in each cage, and then multiply that number by the number of cages.

Step 1: Find the number of birds in one cage.
Each cage has 8 parrots. Since 1 parrot is equal to 1 bird, there are 8 parrots and therefore 8 birds of this type in one cage.
Also, each cage has 2 parakeets, so there are 2 parakeets and therefore 2 birds of this type in one cage.

The number of birds in one cage is: 8 parrots + 2 parakeets = 10 birds.

Step 2: Multiply the number of birds in one cage by the number of cages.
The pet store has 4 bird cages.

Since she cannot make a fraction of a baggie, Maria can only make 1 baggie with the 5 chocolate chip cookies. (The final answer for chocolate chip cookies is 1).

2. Next, let's see how many baggies Maria can make with the 19 oatmeal cookies:

Number of baggies = Number of cookies per bag / Cookies in a baggie
= 8 cookies / 19 oatmeal cookies
≈ 0.421
She cannot make a fraction of a baggie, so Maria can make at most 0 baggies with the 19 oatmeal cookies.

Isabel has baked 3 brownies.

To find out how many more brownies she needs, we can subtract the number of brownies she has already made from the total number she needs for her party:

Total number of brownies needed = 5
Number of brownies already made = 3

Number of brownies still needed = Total number of brownies needed - Number of brownies already made
Number of brownies still needed = 5 - 3
Number of brownies still needed = 2

Now, we need to find out how much flour is required to make one brownie. We're given that each brownie requires 5 cups of flour.

Flour required for each brownie = 5 cups

To find out how much flour Isabel still needs for the remaining 2 brownies, we can multiply the number of remaining brownies by the amount of flour required for each brownie:

Cups of flour still needed = Number of brownies still needed * Flour required for each brownie
Cups of flour still needed = 2 * 5
Cups of flour still needed = 10

Step 3: Eleven new students came to school during the year, so we need to add 11 to the number of students who were still in fourth grade at the end of the student departures.
26 (students remaining after departures) + 11 (new students) = 37 students

The final answer is: 37 students were in fourth grade at the end of the year.</s>",37

                 [/INST] To determine how many points Bianca and her friends earned, we first need to find out how many points they earned from Bianca's recycling and how many points they earned from her friends' recycling.

1. Points earned by Bianca: For every 3 pounds of paper Bianca recycled, she earned 1 point. So, the number of points she earned is equal to the number of pounds she recycled divided by 3.

PointsBianca = PoundsBianca / 3

2. Points earned by her friends: Her friends recycled 3 pounds, so they earned 1 point as well (since it takes 3 pounds to earn 1 point).

PointsFriends = PoundsFriends / 3

3. Total points earned: To find the total number of points earned, we add the points earned by Bianca and her friends.

TotalPoints = PointsBianca + PointsFriends

Let's calculate the points earned by Bianca and her friends using the given information:

1. Points earned by Bianca:
PointsBianca = 24 pounds / 3 pounds/point
PointsBianca = 8 points

2. Points earned by her friends:
PointsFriends = 3 pounds / 3 pounds/point

33 socks (John's initial number) - 19 socks (socks he threw away) = 14 socks
Step 3: Then, John bought 13 new socks.
Step 4: To find the total number of socks John has now, we add the number of socks he had left after throwing away the old ones to the number of new socks he bought:
14 socks (John's remaining socks) + 13 socks (new socks) = {27 socks}

Step 2: The painter has already painted 2 rooms, so we need to find out how many more rooms he needs to paint. Since there are 6 rooms in total and he has painted 2, we need to paint 4 more rooms.

Step 3: To find out how long it takes to paint these 4 rooms, we simply multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to paint one room.

Time to paint 4 rooms = Number of rooms * Time to paint 1 room
= 4 * 5 hours
= 20 hours

                 [/INST] To find the number of tables, we first need to determine how many customers the waiter had at the tables with 4 people each, after 14 customers have left.

1. We know that the waiter had 22 customers in total, and 14 of them left.
2. Therefore, there were 22 - 14 = 8 customers left at the tables.
3. Each table held 4 people. So, the number of tables is the total number of people divided by the number of people per table.
4. Number of tables = Total number of people / People per table = 8 / 4
5. Number of tables = 2

Since there were only enough people for two tables when everyone was present, it's likely that there were two tables in the section to begin with. However, given the information provided, it is impossible to know for sure if some tables had fewer than 4 people when everyone was present. The answer we can definitively give is that there were at least two tables.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Roger puts 48 pieces of clothing in one load.

Step 2: He splits the remaining pieces equally into 9 loads. To find out how many pieces go in each small load, we subtract the number of pieces in the first load from the total number of pieces and divide by the number of small loads.

First, find the number of pieces in the remaining loads:
Total pieces = 120
Pieces in the first load = 48

Pieces in the remaining loads = Total pieces - Pieces in the first load
Pieces in the remaining loads = 120 - 48 = 72

Step 3: Divide the pieces in the remaining loads into 9 equal parts:

Number of pieces in one small load = Number of pieces in the remaining loads / Number of small loads
Number of pieces in one small load = 72 / 9 ≈ 8

So, each of the small loads can hold approximately 8 pieces of clothing.

                 [/INST] Step 1: At the start of the fourth grade year, there were 10 students.

Step 2: During the year, 4 students left the class, so the number of students decreased by 4.

Step 3: Additionally, 42 new students came to the class, so the number of students increased by 42.

Step 4: To find the total number of students in the fourth grade at the end of the year, we add the decrease in students from the start to the increase in students during the year:

Total students = Students at start + (Students left - Students came)

Step 5: Substitute the given values into the equation:

Total students = 10 + (4 - 42)

Step 6: Solve the equation:

Total students = 10 + (-38)

Total students = -28 (This is incorrect, as the number of students cannot be negative)

Step 7: We made an error in step 5. The ""-"" sign in front of ""42 students came"" should not be there. Thus, the correct calculation is:

Total students = 10 + 42

                 [/INST] To determine how many shelves Cody would need to fill up with his sodas, we first need to find out how many regular sodas and diet sodas in total he bought. we know that:
1. Cody bought 4 regular sodas.
2. Cody bought 44 diet sodas.

So the total number of sodas Cody bought is:

Total_sodas = 4 (regular) + 44 (diet) = 48

Now we need to find out how many sodas can be placed on one shelf. We're told that each shelf can hold 6 sodas.

Next, let's calculate how many shelves he would need to fill up completely with regular sodas, and afterward, let's see how many shelves would be needed for the diet sodas.

1. Shelves for regular sodas:
Number_of_shelves_for_regular = Total_regular_sodas / Soda_per_shelf
= 4 / 6
= 0.67 (approximately)
Since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, we would need to round up to the next integer value, which is 2 shelves.

2. Shelves for diet sodas:
Number_of_shelves_for_diet = Total_diet_sodas / Soda_per_shelf
= 44 / 6
= 7.33 (approximately)
Rounding this number up, we get 8 shelves.

Since Cody used up 2 shelves on his regular sodas, we can calculate how many shelves are remaining for the diet sodas, which is:

Total_shelves_needed = Shelves_for_regular + Shelves_for_diet

                     The schools debate team ? had 26 ! boys and 46 girls on it. If they were split into groups of 9 how many groups could they make? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many groups the schools debate team can make when splitting into groups of 9, first we need to find out how many people are in total on the team: 26 boys + 46 girls = 72 people

Next, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group to find out how many groups can be made: 72 people / 9 people per group = 8 groups with a remainder of 3.

However, since the team wants to make full groups of 9, they cannot form an additional group from the remaining 3 people. Instead, they would make 8 groups and have 3 extra people. It's important to note that each group will have 9 members.

Therefore, the final answer is {8 groups}. Unfortunately, the team cannot make an additional full group with the current number of people.</s>",8

                 [/INST] Step 1: The school cafeteria ordered a total of 6 red apples + 15 green apples = 21 apples.
Step 2: Only 5 students wanted fruit, so the cafeteria needed to provide fruit for 5 students.
Step 3: Each student gets one apple, so the cafeteria needed to provide 5 apples.
Step 4: The cafeteria already provided 5 apples (for the students), so they did not use any additional apples for the students.
Step 5: To find the extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples used for the students from the total number of apples ordered.
Step 6: Extra apples = Total apples - Apples for students = 21 apples - 5 apples = 16 apples.

{The final answer is: The cafeteria ended up with 16 extra apples.}</s>",16

                    question:
                     At a company picnic 9 managers and 15 employees decided to start . a game of volleyball. If : they split into 8 teams how many people would be on each ? team? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many people are on each team when 9 managers and 15 employees are split into 8 teams, follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of people at the picnic.
Total number of people = Managers + Employees
Total number of people = 9 (managers) + 15 (employees)
Total number of people = 24

2. Find out how many people will be in each team.
People per team = Total number of people / Number of teams
People per team = 24 (total people) / 8 (teams)
People per team = 3 (approximately)

However, since it's not possible to have exactly three-quarter of a person, we need to consider alternative solutions. One possibility is having 7 players per team and adding one extra person to make it a complete team for one of the teams.

3. Calculate how many people will be in each team, considering the additional person for one team.
Total number of people = 24
7 players per team * 7 teams = 49 people
Number of players in the eighth team = Total number of people - (Number of players per team * (Number of teams - 1))
Number of players in the eighth team = 24 - (7 * 7) = 24 - 49 = -25
Since there’s a negative number, we’ve misunderstood something, so let’s try another possibility.

4. Calculate how many players are in each team by subtracting one player from each team (making one team smaller).
People per team = Total number of people / Number of teams
People per team = 24 (total people) / 8 (teams)
People per team ≈ 3 (but we will subtract one)

Based on this calculation, we propose that the teams would ideally consist of 2 players fewer than the initial approximation.

Final answer: {Each team would consist of approximately 1 person less than if they had split evenly. So, there would be around 2 people less per team, resulting in approximately 21 players per team.}

Note: This calculation assumes that all members are able to play volleyball. If some are unable to play, then the number of players per team may be affected accordingly.</s>",3

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how much money Mike had left after buying new mower blades.
Mike made 42 dollars mowing lawns.
He spent 10 dollars on new mower blades.
So, the amount of money Mike had left is:
42 dollars (amount he made) - 10 dollars (amount he spent on mower blades) = 32 dollars

Step 2: Calculate how many 8-dollar games Mike could buy with the remaining money.
The number of 8-dollar games Mike could buy is equal to the amount of money he had left divided by the cost of each game:
Number of games = 32 dollars (amount of money left) / 8 dollars (cost of each game)

Step 3: Perform the division operation.
Number of games = 32 / 8 = 4

So, Mike could buy 4 games with the money he had left. {The final answer is 4 games.}</s>",4

Since each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, the chef has spent 5 potatoes * 6 minutes per potato = <<5*6=30>>30 minutes cooking the first 5 potatoes.

Next, we'll find out how long it will take the chef to cook the remaining 8 potatoes. Since the cooking time for each potato is constant at 6 minutes, the chef will need an additional 8 potatoes * 6 minutes per potato = <<8*6=48>>48 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.

                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many problems Paige had for homework in math and science combined:

1. Paige had 43 math problems and 12 science problems for homework.

To find the total number of homework problems, we just need to add the number of math problems to the number of science problems:

2. Total number of homework problems = Math problems + Science problems
= 43 + 12
= 55

However, in the problem statement, it says that she finished 44 of the problems at school. But, it doesn't specify which type of problems she finished, so we cannot be sure if those were math or science problems.

Regardless, let's calculate how many problems she had left to do based on the given information.

3. Since she finished 44 of the problems at school, the number of problems she still has to do is given by:
Total number of homework problems - Number of problems she finished at school
= 55 - 44
= 11

Therefore, the final answer is: Paige had to do 11 problems for homework. However, this answer assumes that the 44 problems she finished at school were all from her homework. If some of those problems were from a different source (like classroom activities or extra practice), then the number of remaining homework problems would be different.</s>",11

1. The cost of 3 roses:
- Each rose costs 8 dollars.
- So, the cost of 3 roses is 8 dollars/rose * 3 roses = $24.

2. The cost of 3 daisies:
- Each daisy costs 8 dollars.
- So, the cost of 3 daisies is 8 dollars/daisy * 3 daisies = $24.

3. The total cost of Vanessa's purchase:
- The cost of roses is $24.
- The cost of daisies is $24.

1. Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone, so she has 5 phone pictures.
2. She uploaded 35 pictures from her camera, so she has 35 camera pictures.
3. Therefore, Olivia has a total of 5 (phone pictures) + 35 (camera pictures) = <<5+35=40>>40 pictures.
4. She wants to put these pictures into 8 different albums, each with the same number of pictures.
5. To find the number of pictures in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. So,

                 [/INST] To find out how many cages the pet store used, we first need to determine how many puppies they have left after selling 34.

1. The pet store had 88 puppies in total.
2. They sold 34 of them, so the number of puppies they have left is: 88 (total) - 34 (sold) = 54

Next, we need to figure out how many puppies fit into one cage. Each cage can hold 6 puppies.

                 [/INST] To find the number of trips Jerry needs to make, we first need to determine how many trays he can carry in one trip and how many trays are at each table.

1. Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time.
2. From the first table, he has to pick up 9 trays.
3. From the second table, he has to pick up 7 trays.

To find out how many trips Jerry needs to make for the first table, we divide the number of trays at the first table by the number of trays he can carry in one trip:

1 Trip for the first table = Trays at the first table / Trays per trip
= 9 trays / 8 trays
≈ 1.125 trips

Since he cannot make a fraction of a trip, Jerry will need to make an additional trip for the remaining trays at the first table:

Trips for the first table = 1 (full trip) + 1 (remaining trays) = 2 trips

Similarly, we can find the number of trips Jerry needs to make for the second table:

Trips for the second table = Trays at the second table / Trays per trip
= 7 trays / 8 trays
≈ 0.875 trips

Again, since he cannot make a fraction of a trip, Jerry will need to make another trip for the remaining trays at the second table:

Trips for the second table = 1 (full trip) + 1 (remaining trays) = 2 trips

Finally, we add the number of trips for both tables to find the total number of trips Jerry will make:

Total trips = Trips for the first table + Trips for the second table

It's worth double-checking the problem statement before proceeding further.

Therefore, the solution provided above might not be valid due to the inconsistency in the problem statement. Nonetheless, if we assume that there is an error in the question, and Wendy indeed had 45 files left after deleting 37, then the final answer would be:

                    question:
                     There school's baseball team had 12 new players : and 44 returning players. If the coach put them into ? groups with 8 players in each group, how many . groups would there be? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many groups the coach can form with 12 new players and 44 returning players, first let's find out how many players there are in total:

Total players = New players + Returning players
=> Total players = 12 + 44
=> Total players = 56

Now, let's determine how many players are in each group:
Each group has 8 players.

To find out how many groups the coach can form, divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group:

Number of groups = Total players / Players per group
=> Number of groups = 56 / 8

We cannot divide by 8 directly because 56 is not an exact multiple of 8, so we need to perform some calculations to find out the remainder and number of full groups that can be formed.

First, find the quotient:
=> Quotient = Total players / Players per group
=> Quotient = 56 / 8
=> Quotient = 7 with a remainder of 0 (This is incorrect, the quotient is 7 with a remainder of 2. We assumed there were 12 new players instead of 4. Apologies for the mistake in my initial calculation).

As there is a remainder of 2, we need one more group, which will have less than 8 players:

Number of groups = Quotient + (Remainder / Players per group)
=> Number of groups = 7 + (2 / 8)
=> Number of groups = 7 + 0.25 (since 2/8 = 0.25)
=> Number of groups = 8 ( Rounded to the nearest group size, since a group must contain at least 8 players).

The final answer is: 8 groups.</s>",7

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how much money Will had left after spending on mower blades.
Will earned $104 over the summer. He spent $41 on mower blades.
So, the amount of money left with Will is:
$104 (amount earned) - $41 (amount spent)

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount of money.
$104 - $41 = $63

Step 3: Determine how many 9-dollar games Will could buy with the remaining money.
Each game costs $9. To find out how many games Will could buy, divide the remaining amount of money by the cost of each game.

$63 / $9 = 7

Next, we need to find out how many boxes Paige found in total. She found 6 boxes.

To find the total number of scarves, we can multiply the number of scarves in each box by the number of boxes:

Total scarves = Number of scarves per box * Number of boxes
Total scarves = 5 scarves/box * 6 boxes
Total scarves = 30 scarves

To find the total number of mittens, we do the same:

Total mittens = Number of mittens per box * Number of boxes
Total mittens = 5 mittens/box * 6 boxes
Total mittens = 30 mittens

Finally, to find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we can add the number of scarves and mittens together:

Total clothing = Total scarves + Total mittens
Total clothing = 30 scarves + 30 mittens
Total clothing = 60 pieces

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes for the chef to cook the remaining 6 potatoes, we can follow these steps:

1. We know that 6 potatoes have already been cooked, and each potato takes 6 minutes to cook. So, the time taken to cook the first 6 potatoes is: 6 potatoes * 6 minutes/potato = 36 minutes.

2. Therefore, the remaining number of potatoes to be cooked is: 12 potatoes - 6 potatoes = 6 potatoes.

3. Since we know that each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, the time needed to cook the remaining 6 potatoes is: 6 potatoes * 6 minutes/potato = 36 minutes.

The final answer is: It will take the chef an additional 36 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.</s>",36

                 [/INST] To find out how many boxes Luke used, we first need to determine how many games he had left after selling 39.

Step 1: Find out how many games Luke had left after selling 39.
Luke started out with 57 games, and he sold 39 of them. So the number of games Luke had left is:
57 (total games) - 39 (games sold) = 18 games

Step 2: Determine how many games can fit into one box.
We know that Luke put 2 games into each box. So the number of games one box can hold is:
1 (box) × 2 (games per box) = 2 games

Step 3: Find out how many boxes Luke needed to use to store the remainder of his games.
To do this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:
18 (remaining games) / 2 (games per box)

Step 4: Calculate the number of boxes needed.
The result of the division in step 3 is the number of boxes required:
18 ÷ 2 = 9

                    question:
                     April's discount flowers was ! having a sale where each flower was 3 dollars. ? If Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies, how much did she spend? 
                 [/INST] First, we need to determine how much each type of flower costs during the sale. We know that each flower costs $3, but we don't have enough information to determine if the discount applies to just the sale price or if it's applied to the regular price and the sale price is then $3. However, we can calculate the cost of the flowers Emily bought based on the information given.

Next, we can find the cost of the roses and daisies that Emily bought. Since she bought 2 roses, the cost of the roses is 2 multiplied by $3 per rose.

Cost of roses = 2 * $3
Cost of roses = $6

Similarly, since she bought 2 daisies, the cost of the daisies is 2 multiplied by $3 per daisy.

Cost of daisies = 2 * $3
Cost of daisies = $6

Finally, to find the total amount Emily spent on flowers, we add the cost of the roses and the cost of the daisies.

Total amount spent = Cost of roses + Cost of daisies
Total amount spent = $6 + $6
Total amount spent = $12

So, Emily spent $12 on flowers during the sale at April's discount flowers. {The final answer is $12.}</s>",12

                 [/INST] To determine how many cages the pet store used, we first need to find out how many puppies they had left after selling 7.

Step 1: Find the number of puppies left.
The pet store had 13 puppies originally, and they sold 7. So, the number of puppies left is:

13 (original number of puppies) - 7 (number sold) = 6 puppies

Step 2: Determine how many puppies fit in one cage.
The pet store put the remaining puppies into cages with 2 puppies in each cage.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cages needed.
To find out how many cages the pet store used, divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage:

Number of cages = Number of remaining puppies / Number of puppies per cage
Number of cages = 6 puppies / 2 puppies per cage

Step 4: Perform the division calculation.

Number of cages = 3

So, the pet store used 3 cages for the remaining puppies.

                 [/INST] To find out how many bad carrots there were, we first need to determine the total number of carrots they picked that were not good. We know that Faye picked 0.23 × some number of carrots and her mother picked 5 carrots, and only 12 carrots were good. Let's call the number of carrots in the garden ""x.""

1. Faye picked 0.23 × x carrots: 0.23 × x = 0.23x (multiplying x by 0.23)
2. Her mother picked 5 carrots
3. A total of 12 carrots were good
4. The number of bad carrots is the total number of carrots they picked minus the number of good carrots: x (Faye's carrots) + 5 (her mother's carrots) - 12 (good carrots)
5. Substitute 0.23x from step 1 into the equation from step 4: 0.23x + 5 - 12
6. Simplify and solve for x: 0.23x + 5 - 12 = 0.23x + 4.7 = 0.23x - 7.3

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many bouquets Isabel made with the 66 flowers she picked. Since each bouquet contained 8 flowers, we divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet:

Number of Bouquets = Total Flowers / Flowers per Bouquet
Number of Bouquets = 66 / 8
Number of Bouquets = 8.25

Since Isabel can't make a fraction of a bouquet, we'll round down to 8 bouquets she initially made.

Step 2: Determine how many bouquets Isabel actually made using the remaining flowers after the wilted ones were removed. Since 10 flowers wilted, she had 56 flowers left:

Remaining Bouquets = Total Flowers - Wilted Flowers / Flowers per Bouquet
Remaining Bouquets = 56 / 8
Remaining Bouquets = 7

So, Isabel could make 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers. {The final answer is 7 bouquets}</s>",7

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many tickets Oliver used for the ferris wheel rides.
Since Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times and each ride costs 7 tickets, we can find the number of tickets used for the ferris wheel rides by multiplying the number of rides by the number of tickets used per ride.

Tickets for ferris wheel = Rides on ferris wheel * Tickets per ride
= 5 rides * 7 tickets
= 35 tickets

Step 2: Find out how many tickets Oliver used for the bumper cars rides.
Since Oliver rode the bumper cars 4 times and each ride costs 7 tickets, we can find the number of tickets used for the bumper cars rides by multiplying the number of rides by the number of tickets used per ride.

Tickets for bumper cars = Rides on bumper cars * Tickets per ride
= 4 rides * 7 tickets
= 28 tickets

Step 3: Find out the total number of tickets Oliver used.
We can find the total number of tickets used by Oliver by adding the number of tickets used for the ferris wheel rides and the number of tickets used for the bumper cars rides.

Total tickets = Tickets for ferris wheel + Tickets for bumper cars
= 35 tickets + 28 tickets

Step 2: It takes her 6 minutes to put together one piece of furniture (either a chair or a table).

Step 3: To find out how long it takes her to put together all the chairs, we multiply the number of chairs by the time it takes to put together one chair: 4 chairs × 6 minutes/chair = 24 minutes

Step 4: To find out how long it takes her to put together all the tables, we multiply the number of tables by the time it takes to put together one table: 4 tables × 6 minutes/table = 24 minutes

Step 5: Since she put together all the chairs first and then all the tables, we add the time it took to put together the chairs to the time it took to put together the tables: 24 minutes (chair time) + 24 minutes (table time) = 48 minutes

                 [/INST] To find out how many good games Ned ended up with, we first need to determine how many games in total he bought and how many of them are not working.

Step 1: Find the total number of games Ned bought.
Ned bought games from his friend and at a garage sale. Let's represent the number of games he bought from his friend with the variable F and the number of games he bought at the garage sale with the variable G.

Total number of games = F + G

From the problem, we know that F = 50 and G = 27.

Total number of games = 50 + 27 = 77

Step 2: Find out how many games don't work.
The problem states that 74 of the games didn't work.

Number of bad games = 74

Step 3: Determine the number of good games Ned has.
To find the number of good games, we subtract the number of bad games from the total number of games.

                    question:
                     A pet store had 38 siamese cats : and 25 house cats. During a sale ? they sold 45 cats. How many cats do they have left? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many cats of each type were sold.
 Since there were 38 siamese cats and 25 house cats in the pet store, and they sold a total of 45 cats, we can find out how many of each type were sold by finding the number of siamese cats and house cats sold.

 For the siamese cats, we have:
 - Number of siamese cats initially: 38
 - Number of siamese cats sold: Unknown
 So we can set up the equation: 38 (initial number) = 38 (initial number) - x (number of siamese cats sold) + 45 (number of cats sold)

 Solving this equation yields:
 x = 11

 So, 11 siamese cats were sold.

 Similarly, for the house cats, the equation is:
 - Number of house cats initially: 25
 - Number of house cats sold: Unknown
 So we have: 25 (initial number) = 25 (initial number) - y (number of house cats sold) + 45 (number of cats sold)

 Solving this equation yields:
 y = 18

 So, 18 house cats were sold.

 Step 2: Calculate the total number of cats sold.
 Total number of cats sold = (Number of siamese cats sold) + (Number of house cats sold)
  = 11 + 18
  = 29

 Step 3: Determine the number of cats remaining.
 The pet store had 38 + 25 = 63 cats initially, so the number of cats remaining is:

 Number of cats remaining = Total number of initial cats - Total number of cats sold
 = 63 (total initial cats) - 29 (total cats sold)
 = 34

                    question:
                     Carol . was playing a trivia game. In the first round she scored . 17 points and in , the second round she ! scored 6 points. In the last round she lost 16 points. How many points did she have at the end of the game? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many points Carol had at the end of the game, we first need to find out how many points she scored in total during the first two rounds and then subtract the points she lost in the last round from that number.

Step 1: Find the total number of points Carol scored in the first two rounds.
Carol scored 17 points in the first round and lost 6 points in the second round. So, the total number of points she scored in the first two rounds is:
Total points in the first two rounds = Points scored in the first round + Points scored in the second round
Total points in the first two rounds = 17 points + (0 points - 6 points)
Total points in the first two rounds = 17 points + (-6 points)
Total points in the first two rounds = 11 points

Step 2: Find the total number of points Carol had at the end of the game by subtracting the points she lost in the last round from the total number of points she scored in the first two rounds.
Total points at the end of the game = Total points in the first two rounds - Points lost in the last round
Total points at the end of the game = 11 points - 16 points
Total points at the end of the game = -5 points

However, it's not possible for someone to have a negative number of points. This indicates that there might be an error in the problem statement. It's likely that the number of points lost in the last round was entered incorrectly, and it should have been a gain of 16 points instead.

To find the correct answer, the calculation should be:

Total points at the end of the game = Total points in the first two rounds + Points gained in the last round
Total points at the end of the game = 11 points + 16 points
Total points at the end of the game = 27 points

{The final answer is: Carol had 27 points at the end of the game.}</s>",7

                 [/INST] Step 1: Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy, so the total number of pieces he originally had is:
12 boxes * 3 pieces/box = 36 pieces

Step 2: Dave gave 5 boxes to his little brother, so the number of pieces he gave away is:
5 boxes * 3 pieces/box = 15 pieces

Step 3: To find out how many pieces Dave still has, subtract the number of pieces he gave away from the original number of pieces:
36 pieces (original) - 15 pieces (given away) = 21 pieces

The final answer is: Dave still had 21 pieces of chocolate candy.</s>",21

                 [/INST] To find the number of customers who left a tip, we first need to determine how many customers the waiter had in total during the lunch rush.

Step 1: The waiter had 39 customers to begin with.

Step 2: During the lunch rush, an additional 12 customers arrived, making the total number of customers: 39 + 12 = 51

Step 3: However, we know that 49 customers didn't leave a tip.

Step 4: Therefore, the number of customers who did leave a tip is the total number of customers minus the number of customers who didn't leave a tip: 51 - 49 = 2 customers

The final answer is: 2 customers left a tip.</s>",2

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know the cafeteria had 50! apples (50 factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to 50). But to calculate the number of pies that can be made, we don't really need all these apples, so let's figure out how many pies could be made using the remainder of the apples after handing out 5 to students.

Step 2: The cafeteria handed out 5 apples to students, so they have:
50 ! - 5 = 50 ! - 1 * 5 = 50 * 49 = 2450 apples left

Step 3: Each pie takes 5 apples, so the number of pies that can be made is:
2450 apples / 5 apples per pie = 490 pies

Step 2: By March, Oliver had spent 4 dollars. So, the amount of money Oliver had in March was:
33 (dollars in January) - 4 (dollars spent by March) = 29 dollars

Step 3: Oliver received an additional 32 dollars from his mom.

Step 4: Therefore, the total amount of money Oliver had in March after getting the 32 dollars from his mom is:
29 (dollars from January plus what he had in March) + 32 (dollars he received from his mom) = 61 dollars

                     Zoe was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 8 boxes of clothing and inside each ! box there were 4 scarves ? and 6 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing ! did Zoe have total? 
                 [/INST] To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing Zoe has, we need to find out how many scarves and mittens are in each box and then multiply that by the number of boxes.

First, let's find out how many pieces of clothing (scarves and mittens) are in each box:

1 box contains 4 scarves * (1 piece of clothing per scarf) = 4 scarves
1 box contains 4 scarves + 6 mittens = 10 pieces of clothing (1 piece per mitten and scarf)

So, each box contains 10 pieces of clothing.

Now, we can find the total number of pieces of clothing Zoe has by multiplying the number of pieces in each box by the number of boxes:

Total pieces of clothing = Number of boxes * Pieces per box
Total pieces of clothing = 8 boxes * 10 pieces per box
Total pieces of clothing = 80 pieces

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that each trick deck costs $7.

Step 2: Frank bought 3 decks, so the cost for Frank's decks is 3 * $7 = $21.

Step 3: His friend bought 2 decks, so the cost for his friend's decks is 2 * $7 = $14.

Step 4: To find the total amount spent, we add the cost for Frank's decks to the cost for his friend's decks: $21 + $14 = $35.

                 [/INST] To find out how many shirts Sam did not wash, we first need to determine how many shirts he did wash.

1. Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts in total.
2. He also had to wash 23 long sleeve shirts in total.
3. The number of shirts Sam had washed by the time school started was 29.

Let's calculate the number of short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts Sam had washed:

1. Sam had washed 29 shirts in total.
2. There were 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts in total.
3. So, the number of short sleeve shirts Sam had washed is 29 amongst the 40.
4. To find this as a percentage of the total number of short sleeve shirts, divide 29 by 40 and multiply by 100: (29/40)*100 = 72.5% 

Since Sam couldn't have washed a percentage of a shirt, we know that he must have washed exactly 29 short sleeve shirts.

Now, let's calculate the number of long sleeve shirts he had not washed:

1. Sam had to wash 23 long sleeve shirts, and had washed 0 by the time school started.
2. Therefore, he had not washed 23 long sleeve shirts.
