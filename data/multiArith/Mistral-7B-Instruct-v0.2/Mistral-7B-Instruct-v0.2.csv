                    question:
                     Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Paige started with 11 songs on her mp3 player.
Step 2: She deleted 9 old songs from it. So, the number of songs on her mp3 player after deleting old songs is 11 (initial number) - 9 (deleted songs) = 2 songs less. That is, she had 2 songs left on her mp3 player after deleting the old songs.
Step 3: Then she added 8 new songs to her mp3 player. So, the number of songs on her mp3 player after adding new songs is the number of songs she had after deleting old songs (2) + number of new songs (8).

The final answer is: Paige has 10 songs (2 old songs + 8 new songs) on her mp3 player.</s>",10

                    question:
                     There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we first need to determine how many students were called back. We know that there were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out, so the total number of students is:

Total students = Girls + Boys
                     = 39 + 4
                     = 43

However, we know that only 26 students were called back. So, to find out how many students didn't make the cut, we subtract the number of called students from the total number of students:

Students who didn't make the cut = Total students - Called students
                                               = 43 - 26
                                               = 17

Therefore, the answer is:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Faye started with 34 coloring books.

Step 2: She gave away 3 books, so she had 31 coloring books left (34 - 3 = 31).

Step 3: She bought 48 more coloring books, so now she has 79 coloring books in total (31 + 48 = 79).

                 [/INST] Step 1: The school cafeteria started with 23 apples.

Step 2: They used 20 apples to make lunch for the students, so the number of apples left is: 23 (initial apples) - 20 (apples used) = 3 apples.

Step 3: Then, they bought 6 more apples. To find the number of apples they have now, we add the apples they had left after using some for lunch to the apples they bought: 3 (remaining apples) + 6 (apples bought) = 9 apples.

{The final answer is: 9 apples.}</s>",9

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that each enemy defeated gives us 9 points.

Step 2: This level has a total of 11 enemies.

Step 3: We have defeated all but 3 of the enemies, so the number of enemies we have not defeated is 3.

Step 4: To find out how many points we earn, we need to find out how many points we get for defeating the number of enemies we have actually defeated. We have defeated 11 total enemies - 3 remaining enemies = 8 enemies.

Step 5: So, to find the number of points we earn, we multiply the number of enemies defeated by the points earned per enemy: Points earned = Enemies defeated * Points per enemy
Points earned = 8 * 9

Step 6: Perform the multiplication: Points earned = 8 * 9
Points earned = 72

The final answer is: You would earn 72 points for defeating all but 3 enemies in the level.</s>",72

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many bags Megan recycled.
She had 14 bags in total, but she didn't recycle 5 of them. So, she recycled 14 - 5 = <<14-5=9>>9 bags.

Step 2: Calculate the number of points Megan earned for recycling these bags.
Megan earned 8 points for each bag, so she earned 9 bags * 8 points/bag = <<9*8=72>>72 points for recycling these bags.

" Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? ","<s> [INST]

                    question:
                     Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? 
                 [/INST] To determine how many shirts Ned did not wash, we first need to find out how many shirts he washed and how many he had to wash in total.

1. Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts (ss).
2. Ned had to wash 21 long sleeve shirts (ls).

Total shirts Ned had to wash = ss + ls = 9 + 21 = 30

3. When school started, Ned had washed 29 shirts.

However, we don't know whether the 29 shirts Ned washed were all short-sleeve or long-sleeve shirts, or a combination of both. To find out how many shirts he did not wash, we first need to determine how many short-sleeve shirts and how many long-sleeve shirts he washed. We'll assume for now that all 29 shirts are short-sleeve shirts, but we'll adjust our calculation if that's not the case.

1. If all 29 shirts were short-sleeve shirts, then Ned washed 29 ss shirts, so he did not wash 1 ss shirt (30 - 29 = 1).

However, we know that's not the case, so let's see if we can find out how many short-sleeve shirts and long-sleeve shirts he actually washed.

Since Ned had to wash 30 shirts in total:

1. If we assume x ss shirts and y ls shirts were washed, then x + y = 30.
2. The number of short-sleeve shirts Ned washed is x, and we know x < 9 because he didn't wash all of them.
3. The number of long-sleeve shirts Ned washed is y, and we know y < 21 because he didn't wash all of them.

From the information given, we cannot definitively determine the exact number of short-sleeve and long-sleeve shirts Ned washed before school. Therefore, we cannot give a definitive answer to how many he did not wash.

                    question:
                     A company invited 47 people to a luncheon, but 7 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 5 people each, how many tables do they need? 
                 [/INST] Solution:

1. First, we need to determine how many people actually attended the luncheon. This is calculated by subtracting the number of people who didn't show up from the total number of invited guests.
2. Total number of invited guests = 47
3. Number of people who didn't show up = 7
4. Therefore, the number of people who attended = 47 - 7 = 40
5. Next, we need to determine how many people can sit at one table. We are told that each table holds 5 people.
6. Since we want to find out how many tables they need, we can divide the total number of people who attended by the number of people each table can hold.
7. The calculation is as follows:
8. Number of tables needed = Total number of people / People per table
9. Number of tables needed = 40 / 5 
10. Number of tables needed = 8
11. However, since they cannot have a fraction of a table, they need to round up to ensure everyone has a seat.
12. Therefore, they would need to rent 9 tables instead of 8 to accommodate all the guests who showed up.
13. {The final answer is 9 tables are needed.}</s>",8

                    question:
                     Tom had 5 books. If he sold 4 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Tom have? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Tom initially had 5 books.

Step 2: Tom sold 4 of his books and earned money from the sale. we don't have the exact amount of money but we can find out how many books he bought with that money.

Step 3: Tom used the money from selling 4 books to buy 38 new books. So, we need to find out how many books Tom can buy with that money.
Let's denote the price of one new book as x. Then,
5 sold books × price per book = amount of money earned
5 × x = amount earned

Step 4: amount earned = 5x
38 new books = amount earned/ price per new book
38 = 5x/x
38 = 5x
x = 38/5 = 7.6, This is not a reasonable price for a book so there is an error in the problem.

But even if we had the correct price for the new books, Tom's final number of books would be the initial number of books he had (5) plus the number of new books he bought.

{The final answer cannot be determined due to an error in the problem.}</s>",39

                 [/INST] To determine how many shelves Jerry's fridge would fill up, we need to find out how many sodas he bought in total and then divide that number by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.

1. Jerry bought 41 regular sodas.
2. He also bought 22 diet sodas.
3. So, the total number of sodas Jerry bought is: 41 (regular) + 22 (diet) = 63 sodas
4. Each shelf can hold 9 sodas.
5. To find out how many shelves Jerry would fill up, we divide the total number of sodas (63) by the number of sodas each shelf can hold (9): 63 ÷ 9 = 7 shelves

                     For Halloween Emily received 5 pieces of candy from neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 9 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her? 
                 [/INST] To find out how long the candy will last Emily, we first need to find out how many pieces of candy she has in total.

Total pieces of candy = Pieces from neighbors + Pieces from older sister
Total pieces of candy = 5 + 13
Total pieces of candy = 18

Next, we need to find out how many days she can eat 9 pieces of candy per day.

Number of days = Total pieces of candy / Pieces eaten per day
Number of days = 18 / 9

To get the exact answer, we can simplify the fraction:

Number of days = 18 / 9
Number of days = 2
Number of days = 2 with a remainder of 6 when divided by 9

So Emily can eat 9 pieces of candy per day for 2 days, but she will still have 6 pieces of candy left over.

Therefore, the final answer is {2 days and 6 pieces of candy left}.</s>",2

                 [/INST] step 1: Find out how many books Mike is left with after the librarian takes 10.
Total books = 82
Books taken by librarian = 10
Books left for Mike = Total books - Books taken
Books left for Mike = 82 - 10 = 72

step 2: Find out how many books Mike can put on one shelf.
Books per shelf = 9

step 3: Determine how many shelves Mike will need to put away all the remaining books.
Number of shelves = Total books left for Mike / Books per shelf
Number of shelves = 72 / 9
Number of shelves = 8

However, since Mike can't have a fraction of a shelf, he would need to round up to the next whole number if necessary. Since 8 shelves can accommodate 72 books with no remaining slots, there's no need to round up.

{The final answer is: Mike will need 8 shelves to put away all the books.}</s>",8

2. The total number of windows needed for the building is 14. We can calculate the number of windows that still need to be installed as follows:
   Windows to be installed = Total windows - Windows installed
   Windows to be installed = 14 - 8
   Windows to be installed = 6

3. We also know that it takes 8 hours to install each window. Using this information, we can calculate the time it takes to install the remaining windows as follows:
   Time to install the rest = Number of windows to be installed * Time per window
   Time to install the rest = 6 * 8
   Time to install the rest = 48 hours

So, the final answer is: It will take the builder 48 hours to install the remaining windows.</s>",48

Step 2: Next, we are told that they threw away 25 oranges, so we need to subtract that number from the original amount.

Oranges in the bin = 40
Number of oranges removed = 25

Step 3: Oranges removed = Oranges in the bin (before removal) - Oranges now in the bin

Oranges in the bin (after removal) = Oranges in the bin (before removal) - Oranges removed

Oranges in the bin (after removal) = 40 - 25

Step 4: Simplify the equation to find the number of oranges left in the bin after throwing away the old ones:

Oranges in the bin (after removal) = 15

Step 5: Lastly, we are told that they added 21 new oranges to the bin. So, we simply add that number to the number of oranges already in the bin.

Oranges in the bin = Oranges in the bin (after removing old ones) + New oranges

Oranges in the bin = 15 + 21

Step 6: Add the numbers to find the final number of oranges in the bin.

Oranges in the bin = 15 + 21 = 36

                 [/INST] To find out how many chicken wings each person got, we first need to determine the total number of wings the chef cooked for the group of 4 friends.

1. The chef had 9 chicken wings cooked before the friends arrived.
2. He then cooked 7 more wings for the group.
3. So, the total number of wings cooked is 9 + 7 = 16.

Since the group consisted of 4 people, and each person got the same amount, we can divide the total number of wings by the number of people to find out how many wings each person got.

The final answer is: Each person got 16 ÷ 4 = 4 chicken wings. {The final answer is each person got 4 chicken wings}.</s>",4

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes for all the puppies to be adopted, we first need to determine the total number of puppies at the shelter and then divide that number by the number of puppies adopted each day.

Step 1: Find the total number of puppies at the shelter.
5 (initial puppies) + 35 (new intake) = 40 puppies

Step 2: Determine the number of days it takes to adopt out all the puppies.
Total number of puppies (40) / Number of puppies adopted per day (8) = approximation of 5.25 days

However, since we can't have a fraction of a day, we need to find the number of full days required by calculating the Ceiling function.

Step 3: Calculate the number of full days required.
Ceiling(Total number of days) = Ceiling(Total number of puppies / Number of puppies adopted per day)
Ceiling(40/8) = Ceiling(5) = 6

Therefore, it would take approximately 6 full days for all the puppies to be adopted. {The final answer is: It would take approximately 6 full days for all the puppies to be adopted}</s>",5

1. We know that 6 windows have already been installed, and it took 6 hours to install each window. So, 6 windows took 6 hours.

2. We need to find out how long it will take to install the remaining 3 windows. First, let's calculate how many hours have been spent installing the first 6 windows: hours spent = number of windows * hours per window.

3. hours spent = 6 windows * 6 hours/window = 36 hours.

4. Now, to install the remaining 3 windows, we can use the same rate of 6 hours per window.

5. Therefore, it will take 3 windows * 6 hours/window = 18 hours to install the rest of the windows.

                 [/INST] To find out how many candies Frank can buy, we first need to determine the total number of tickets he won.

Step 1: Calculate the number of tickets Frank won playing 'whack a mole'.
He won 33 tickets playing this game.

Step 2: Calculate the number of tickets Frank won playing 'skee ball'.
He won 9 tickets playing this game.

Step 3: Add the number of tickets Frank won in both games to find the total number of tickets he has.
Total tickets = Tickets won playing whack a mole + Tickets won playing skee ball
Total tickets = 33 + 9
Total tickets = 42

Step 4: Now, let's find out how many candies Frank can buy.
If each candy costs 6 tickets, the number of candies Frank can buy is equal to the number of tickets he has divided by the cost of one candy in tickets.

Number of candies = Total tickets / Cost per candy (in tickets)
Number of candies = 42 / 6
Number of candies = 7

So, Frank can buy 7 candies with the tickets he won at the arcade.

First, let's find the number of adults in the group: Total number of people = Adults + Kids, so number of adults = Total number of people - Number of kids.

number of adults = 13 - 9 = 4

Next, let's find the cost for the adults: Cost for adults = Number of adults * Cost per adult meal.

cost for adults = 4 * $7 = $28

Since kids eat free, the cost for the kids is $0.

Now, we can find the total cost for the group: Total cost = Cost for adults + Cost for kids.

total cost = $28 + $0 = $28

Rachel found 5 treasures on the first level, and she earns 9 points for each treasure. So, her points on the first level are:
5 treasures * 9 points per treasure = 45 points

She found 2 treasures on the second level, so her points on the second level are:
2 treasures * 9 points per treasure = 18 points

Step 2: Add her points from each level to find her total score.
Total score = Points on level 1 + Points on level 2
Total score = 45 points + 18 points = 63 points

1. The waiter had 26 customers to start with.
2. During the lunch rush, he had an additional 27 customers.
3. In total, he had 26 + 27 = 53 customers.
4. We know that 27 of these customers didn't leave a tip.
5. To find out how many customers did leave a tip, we subtract the number of customers who didn't tip from the total number of customers: 53 (total) - 27 (no tip) = 26

Step 1: Find the total number of bears after the new shipment.
Total bears = 17 (initially) + 10 (new shipment) = 27 bears.

Step 2: Divide the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf.
Number of shelves = Total bears / Bears per shelf.

Step 3: Plug in the given values.
Number of shelves = 27 / 9

Step 4: Perform the division.
Number of shelves = 3 (remainder) / 9 = 0 with a quotient of 3.
So, the store used 3 full shelves and an additional shelf for the remaining 3 bears.

                 [/INST] To find the total number of books Gwen has, we first need to determine how many books are on each type of shelf (mystery and picture), and then multiply that by the number of shelves for each type.

1. Number of books on each mystery shelf: {Each mystery shelf has exactly 4 books}.
2. Number of mystery shelves: {Gwen has 5 shelves of mystery books}.
3. Number of books on each picture shelf: {Each picture shelf has exactly 4 books}.
4. Number of picture shelves: {Gwen has 3 shelves of picture books}.

Next, we calculate the total number of books for each type:

Total number of mystery books: {Number of books per shelf * Number of mystery shelves} = 4 * 5 = 20
Total number of picture books: {Number of books per picture shelf * Number of picture shelves} = 4 * 3 = 12

Finally, we add the total number of mystery books and picture books to find the overall total number of books:

                     Wendy uploaded 79 pictures to Facebook. She put 44 pics into one album and put the rest into 5 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? 
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Wendy uploaded a total of 79 pictures to Facebook.
2. She put 44 pictures into one album.
3. The remaining pictures were distributed among 5 different albums.

To find out how many pictures were in each of the 5 albums, we first need to determine how many pictures were in the first (larger) album. We know that there were 44 pictures in the first album, so:

Total number of pictures = Pictures in the first album + Pictures in all 5 other albums
79 = 44 + (Number of pictures in each of the 5 other albums) * 5

Solving this equation for the number of pictures in each of the 5 other albums, we get:

Number of pictures in each of the 5 other albums = (Total number of pictures - Pictures in the first album) / Number of albums in the second group
Number of pictures in each of the 5 other albums = (79 - 44) / 5
Number of pictures in each of the 5 other albums = 11.8

Since the number of pictures in each album must be a whole number, we know that there's an error in the problem statement or our calculations. As it stands, we cannot have exactly 11.8 pictures in an album. {The final answer is unavailable in its current form.}

To provide a feasible solution, we would need to determine whether the problem statement had an error, or if Wendy distributed the remaining pictures unevenly among the albums.

If the problem statement did have an error, we would need to find the correct number of pictures that Wendy put into each of the 5 other albums. We could try solving this problem with different integer values for the number of pictures in each of the 5 other albums until we find a valid solution.

Alternatively, if Wendy distributed the remaining pictures unevenly among the albums, we would need to find a distribution pattern that allows for whole numbers of pictures in each album. For example, if she put 3, 5, 7, 8 and 20 pictures into each of the 5 albums, respectively, then we have a valid solution.

In summary, to find the number of pictures in each of the 5 other albums, we can either find the correct value in the problem statement or distribution pattern that results in whole numbers for each album. {The final answer depends on the accurate values of the problem statement or distribution pattern.}</s>",7

                     The schools debate team had 5 boys and 40 girls on it. If they were split into groups of 9 how many groups could they make? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many groups the schools debate team can form with 5 boys and 40 girls when they are all in groups of size 9, we first calculate the total number of people in the team, then divide this number by the size of each group.

1. Calculate the total number of people: 5 boys + 40 girls = 45 girls + 5 boys = 45 + 5 = 50 people.

2. Divide the total number of people by the size of each group: 50 / 9.

At this point, we cannot directly divide 50 by 9 to find the number of groups because we cannot have a fraction or a decimal number of groups. Therefore, we need to look for the quotient and remainder.

3. Calculate the quotient (number of full groups): 50 ÷ 9 ≈ 5.5556. Since the size of each group is 9, there cannot be a group with a remainder, meaning we can only form 5 full groups.

Now, we need to look for any remaining members that might not be part of these 5 groups.

4. Calculate the remainder: 50 % 9 = 1. Since there is one person left that does not fit into a full group of 9.

5. We cannot form another group with this remaining person, so we subtract the size of the last full group (9 people) from our previous quotient and add the extra person to the last group.

Finally, calculating the new quotient and adding the previous remainder to obtain the final number of groups: (5 - 1) * 9 + 1 = 4 * 9 + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37.

So, the schools debate team can form 37 groups, considering they must have only full groups of 9 people, regardless of whether the last group will be full or not.

                 [/INST] To find out how much money April earned during the sale, we need to find out how much she spent on roses and then subtract that amount from the total amount she earned.

1. First, let's find out how much April spent on roses. She started with 9 roses andeach rose was 7 dollars, so she spent 9 * 7 = $<<9*7=63>>63 on roses.
2. Next, let's find out how much money April earned in total. She started with 9 roses and had 4 roses left, so she sold 5 roses. Each rose was 7 dollars, so she earned 5 * 7 = $<<5*7=35>>35.
3. To find the total amount she earned, we need to subtract the amount she spent on roses from the amount she earned. So, the final answer is $<<35-63=-28>>-28. However, it's not possible for someone to lose money in this situation, so there must be an error in the problem. One possible solution could be that April sold more than just the 5 roses that were left.

Step 2: They sold 10 cats during the sale. However, we don't know how many siamese cats and how many house cats were sold.

Step 3: Let's assume all cats sold were siamese cats. In that case, they would have sold 10 siamese cats, leaving them with 13 siamese cats - 10 = 3 siamese cats. The total number of cats they would have then would be 3 siamese cats + 5 house cats = 8 cats.

Step 4: Alternatively, they could have sold all house cats leaving them with 13 siamese cats - 5 = 8 siamese cats and having no house cats left. The total number of cats they would have then would be 8 siamese cats.

                     Victor was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 6 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 5 hours and on Tuesday he worked 5 hours. How much money did Victor make in those two days? 
                 [/INST] To find out how much money Victor made in those two days, we need to calculate his earnings for each day and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate Victor's earnings for each day.
Victor earned $6 an hour, and he worked for 5 hours on both Monday and Tuesday, so:

Monday's earnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked
Monday's earnings = $6 * 5 hours
Monday's earnings = $30

Tuesday's earnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked
Tuesday's earnings = $6 * 5 hours
Tuesday's earnings = $30

Step 2: Add Victor's earnings from both days to find his total earnings.
Total earnings = Monday's earnings + Tuesday's earnings
Total earnings = $30 + $30
Total earnings = $60

{The final answer is $60}.</s>",60

                     Megan baked 71 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 43 of them how many packages could she make if she put 7 cupcake in each package? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many cupcakes are left after Todd ate his share.
Megan baked 71 cupcakes. Todd ate 43 of them. So, the number of cupcakes Megan has left is: 71 (total) - 43 (eaten by Todd) = <ins>28</ins> cupcakes

Step 2: Divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package to find the number of packages.
Since each package contains 7 cupcakes, the number of packages Megan can make is: 28 (remaining cupcakes) / 7 (cupcakes per package) = <ins>4</ins>. Therefore, Megan could make {The final answer is: 4 packages} from the remaining cupcakes.</s>",4

                 [/INST] To find the total number of lives for the 4 friends playing the video game, we can follow these steps:

1. We know that each friend had 6 lives.
2. Since there are 2 friends initially, we have a total of 2 * 6 = <<2*6=12>>12 lives for the initial 2 friends.
3. Then, 2 more players join the game, so we add their lives to the total: 12 lives (initial) + 2 * 6 = 12 + 2 * 6 = 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 lives.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Sam started with 10 socks.

Step 2: He threw away 3 old socks, so we subtract 3 from his initial number: 10 - 3 = 7 socks remaining.

Step 3: Sam bought 36 new socks. We add this number to the remaining socks: 7 + 36 = 43 socks in total.

The final answer is: Sam has 43 socks.</s>",43

                    question:
                     Wendy picked 103 flowers for her friend’s wedding. She was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. If 47 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find out how many bouquets Wendy was able to make with the 103 flowers she picked. To do this, divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet:

Number of bouquets = Total flowers / Flowers per bouquet
= 103 / 8
= 12.625

Since Wendy cannot make a fraction of a bouquet, she can only make 12 bouquets with the initial 103 flowers.

Step 2: Now that we know Wendy was able to make 12 bouquets and 47 flowers wilted, we need to find out how many flowers were still usable. Subtract the wilted flowers from the original 103 to get the number of remaining flowers:

Remaining flowers = Initial flowers - Wilting flowers
= 103 - 47
= 56

Step 3: To calculate how many bouquets Wendy could still make with the remaining 56 flowers, we use the same formula as before:

Number of remaining bouquets = Remaining flowers / Flowers per bouquet
= 56 / 8
= 7

Therefore, the final answer is: Wendy could still make 7 bouquets with the 56 usable flowers.</s>",7

                 [/INST] Step 1: Adam started with 48 books.
Step 2: He sold 19 books, so the number of books Adam had was reduced by 19.

Books Adam had before selling = 48
Number of books sold = 19

Step 3: Subtract the number of books sold from the initial number of books to find out how many books Adam had left after selling some.

 Books Adam had after selling = Initial number of books - Number of books sold
 = 48 - 19
 = 29

Step 4: Adam used the money he earned from selling the books to buy new books. The number of new books he bought was 38.

Step 5: Add the number of new books to the number of books Adam had left after selling some to find out how many books he had in total now.

Total number of books Adam has = Books Adam had after selling + New books bought
 = 29 + 38
 = 67

                 [/INST] To find out how many vans are needed for Nancy's class to go on a field trip to the zoo, we'll calculate the total number of people and then divide that number by the capacity of each van. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Determine the number of students: The question states that there are 12 students.

2. Determine the number of adults: The question states that there are 3 adults.

3. Calculate the total number of people: The total number of people is the sum of the number of students and adults, so their number is 12 (students) + 3 (adults) = 15 people.

4. Determine the capacity of each van: Each van can hold 5 people.

5. Calculate the number of vans needed: To find out how many vans are needed, divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van: 15 (people) / 5 (people per van) = 3 vans.

However, due to rounding errors or potential issues with the availability of a partial van, it's generally recommended to round up to the nearest whole number in this scenario to ensure everyone can go on the field trip.

1. Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas, so the total number of sodas is: 4 (regular) + 52 (diet) = 56
2. The fridge can hold 7 sodas on each shelf.
3. To find out how many shelves he would need, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can be held on each shelf: 56 (total) ÷ 7 (per shelf) = 8

                 [/INST] To find out how many apples the school cafeteria has after using some for lunch and buying more, follow these steps:

1. Subtract the number of apples used for lunch from the initial number of apples.
   Initial apples = 38
   Apples used for lunch = 20
   So, the difference is (38 - 20), which equals 18.

2. Add the number of new apples purchased to the remaining amount from step 1.
   Remaining apples = 18
   New apples = 28
    So, the total number of apples is (18 + 28), which equals 46.

                     Luke was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 4 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another, how many trips will he make? 
                 [/INST] First, let's determine how many trays Luke can pick up in total with one trip. This is given as 4 trays per trip.

Next, we need to find out how many trays he needs to pick up in total from both tables. This is given as 20 trays for the first table and 16 trays for the second table, for a grand total of 20 + 16 = <ins>36 trays</ins>.

Now, we need to figure out how many trips it will take Luke to pick up all 36 trays. We know that he can carry 4 trays at a time, so we divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry in one trip: 36 trays ÷ 4 trays per trip = <ins>9 trips</ins>.

Therefore, {The final answer is: Luke will make 9 trips to pick up all the trays}.</s>",9

Step 2: They gave out 42 apples to students, leaving them with: 96 (total apples) - 42 (apples given to students) = 54 apples.

Step 3: Each pie requires 6 apples. To find out how many pies they could make with the remaining apples, divide the total number of apples left by the number of apples needed for one pie: 54 (apples left) / 6 (apples per pie) = 9 pies (with remainder 2).

Since they cannot make a fraction of a pie, they can only make 9 pies with the given apples.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of action figures Henry needs in total.
Henry had 3 action figures, but he needed 8 in total for a complete collection. So, he needs an additional number of action figures which is the difference between the number of action figures he has and the number he needs for a complete collection.

Step 2: Find the difference between the number of action figures Henry needs and has.
He needs 8 total and he has 3, so the difference is 5.

Step 3: Multiply the number of action figures needed by the cost of each one to find the total amount of money needed.

                 [/INST] To answer this question, we need to find out how many 8-dollar toys Frank can buy after receiving an additional allowance of 37 dollars. 

First, let's calculate how much money Frank now has in total:

1. Frank initially had 3 dollars, so we have: 
   initial_money = 3 dollars
2. He then received an allowance of 37 dollars, so we have:
   received_money = 37 dollars
3. To find out how much money Frank has in total, we add initial_money and received_money:
   total_money = initial_money + received_money
   = 3 dollars + 37 dollars
   = 3 tens + 7 ones
   = 4 tens + 7 ones
   = 43 ones
   = 43 dollars

Now we need to find out how many 8-dollar toys Frank can buy:

1. To determine the number of 8-dollar toys that Frank can buy, divide the total_money by the cost of one toy:
   toys = total_money // toy_cost
   = 43 dollars // 8 dollars/toy

2. Calculating the division in dollars: 
   $43 / $8 = 5.375

3. Since we can't buy a fraction of a toy, we round down to the nearest whole number:
    toys = 5

                 [/INST] To find out how many bad carrots they had, we first need to determine how many good carrots they picked in total. We know that Vanessa picked 17 and her mother picked 14.

Total number of good carrots picked = Carrots picked by Vanessa + Carrots picked by her mother
= 17 + 14
= 31

However, we are told that only 24 of the carrots were good. This means that there must have been some bad carrots in the garden.

First, let's find out how many bad carrots Vanessa picked:

Bad carrots picked by Vanessa = Total carrots picked by Vanessa - Good carrots picked by Vanessa
= 17 - 17 (since we don't know how many of the carrots picked by Vanessa were good)
= 0 (This doesn't make sense, so there must be an error in the problem statement)

Similarly, we can find out how many bad carrots her mother picked:

Bad carrots picked by her mother = Total carrots picked by her mother - Good carrots picked by her mother
= 14 - 14 (since we don't know how many of the carrots picked by her mother were good)
= 0 (This also doesn't make sense, so there must be an error in the problem statement)

There seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement as both good and bad carrots picked by both Vanessa and her mother are stated to be equal to their total picks, which doesn't make sense. It appears that the problem statement is incomplete or incorrect.

                                   = 30 people

Next, we need to form 6 teams. We can divide the total number of people by the number of people each team should have to find out how many people should be on each team.

Number of people per team = Total number of people / Number of teams
                                       = 30 people / 6 teams

Step 1: Calculate the number of carrots picked by Carol:
Carol picked 29 carrots.

Step 2: Calculate the number of carrots picked by Carol's mother:
Carol's mother picked 16 carrots.

Step 3: Find the total number of carrots picked by both Carol and her mother:
Total carrots picked = Carrots picked by Carol + Carrots picked by her mother
Total carrots picked = 29 + 16 = 45

Step 4: Determine the number of good carrots in the garden:
There were only 38 good carrots in the garden.

Step 2: Two more players join the game, so we add 2 to the number of players. Now, we have 10 players.

Step 3: Each player initially had 6 lives. So, to find the total number of lives, we multiply the number of players by the number of lives for each player.

Total Lives = Number of Players * Lives per Player

                     At the arcade Cody won 49 tickets. If he spent 25 tickets on a beanie and later won 6 more tickets, how many would he have? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Cody won a total of 49 tickets at the arcade.
Step 2: He spent 25 tickets on a beanie, so he no longer has those tickets.
Step 3: He then won an additional 6 tickets.

Step 4: To find out how many tickets Cody has in total after spending some on the beanie and winning more, we can subtract the number of tickets he spent from the total number of tickets he won initially and add the number of tickets he won later.

So the calculation would be:

Total number of tickets Cody has = Initial tickets won + Tickets won later - Tickets spent

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total number of tickets Cody has = 49 + 6 - 25

Step 5: Now let's do the calculation:

Total number of tickets Cody has = 49 + 6 - 25
Total number of tickets Cody has = 49 + 6 - 21 (Since 25 is 21 plus 4)
Total number of tickets Cody has = 54 - 21
Total number of tickets Cody has = 33

                 [/INST] To find out how many piles Bianca can make with the remaining candies, we first need to determine how many candies are left after she ate 30 pieces.

1. Bianca received a total of 78 pieces of candy.
2. She ate 30 pieces, so the number of candies left is:
   Remaining_candies = Total_candies - Eaten_candies
   Remaining_candies = 78 - 30
   Remaining_candies = 48

Now that we know Bianca has 48 candies left, we need to figure out how many candies are in each pile.

3. We're told that each pile contains 8 candies.

To find the number of piles, we divide the remaining candies by the number of candies in each pile.

4. Number_of_piles = Total_remaining_candies / Candies_per_pile
   Number_of_piles = 48 / 8
   Number_of_piles = 6

There are 11 people in total and 2 of them are kids. So there are 11 - 2 = 9 adults.
Each adult meal costs $8, so the cost for the adults is $8 * 9 = $72.

Step 2: Calculate the cost for the kids' meals since they eat free, the cost is $0.

Step 3: Add the cost for the adult meals and the cost for the kids' meals to find the total cost for the group.
Total cost = $72 (adult meals) + $0 (kids' meals) = $72.

                     Nancy had 80 files on her computer. She deleted 31 of them and put the rest into folders with 7 files in each one. How many folders did Nancy end up with? 
                 [/INST] Let's reason through the problem step by step:

1. Nancy had 80 files in total.
2. She deleted 31 files, so the number of files left is:
   files_left = initial_files - deleted_files
   files_left = 80 - 31
   files_left = 49
3. Nancy put the remaining files into folders, each containing 7 files.
4. To find the number of folders, we need to divide the total number of files by the number of files per folder:
   number_of_folders = total_files / files_per_folder
   number_of_folders = 49 / 7

Unfortunately, we cannot perform this division directly as the quotient is not a whole number. This means that Nancy cannot put exactly 49 files into 7-file folders without leaving some files over. Instead, let's determine how many complete sets of 7 files we can create from the 49 remaining files and add one more folder for the leftovers.

5. We can create the following sets of 7 files from the 49 remaining files:
   sets_of_7 = 49 / 7
   sets_of_7 = 7
   So, we can put 7 sets of files (49 files in total) into 7-file folders.

6. Since we still have one leftover file, we need to create an additional folder for this file.

                 [/INST] To find out how many boxes Luke used, we first need to determine how many games he had left after selling 19.

1. Luke started with 39 games.
2. He sold 19 games.
3. Therefore, he had 39 - 19 = <<39-19=18>>18 games left.

Next, we need to figure out how many games are in each box:

1. Each box holds 4 games.

Now we can find out how many boxes Luke needed by dividing the number of games he had left by the number of games per box.

1. He had 18 games left.
2. So, we divide 18 games by 4 games per box: 18 ÷ 4 = <<18/4=4.5>>4.5 boxes.
3. Since we can't have a half box, we'll round up and add one more box to make sure all the games fit.

Therefore, the final answer is that Luke had to use {5 boxes}.</s>",5

3. So, the number of students who were picked for the team is: Total students - Students not picked = 65 - 17 = 48
4. We're told that these 48 students were put into 8 groups.
5. To find the number of students in each group, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups: Number of students per group = Total students / Number of groups = 48 / 8 = 6

1. Isabel uploaded a total of 25 pictures to Facebook.
2. She put 10 pictures into one album. So, the number of pictures in the first album is 10.
3. The remaining pictures were distributed among 5 different albums.
4. Therefore, the number of pictures in each of the 5 remaining albums is the total number of pictures minus the number of pictures in the first album divided by the number of remaining albums.

Here is the calculation:
Number of pictures in each of the remaining albums = (Total number of pictures - Pictures in the first album) / Number of remaining albums
= (25 - 10) / 5

Total earnings = Money earned mowing lawns + Money earned weed eating
Total earnings = $14 + $26
Total earnings = $38

Next, we need to find out how long his money will last him if he spends $5 per week. To do this, we'll divide his total earnings by the amount he spends each week:

Amount of time (weeks) = Total earnings / Weekly spending
Amount of time (weeks) = $38 / $5

Let's calculate this:

                 [/INST] The total number of pieces of clothing Will has is 59. He has already put 32 in one load, so we need to find out how many pieces can go into each of the 9 small loads.

First, let's find out how many pieces of clothing are left after the first load:

Total clothing = 59
Clothes in first load = 32

Remaining clothes = Total clothing - Clothes in first load

Next, we need to find out how many pieces of clothing can go into each of the 9 small loads. To do this, we simply divide the number of remaining clothes by the number of small loads:

Clothes per small load = Remaining clothes / Number of small loads
= 27 / 9
≈ 3

However, since we can't have a fraction of a piece of clothing in a load, we need to adjust this number. To do this, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3.

Therefore, each small load can hold approximately 3 pieces of clothing. {The final answer is: Each small load can hold approximately 3 pieces of clothing.}</s>",3

$12 (initial amount) - $8 (amount spent) = $4

So, Kaleb had $4 left to buy 2 dollar toys.

Step 4: Find out how many 2 dollar toys he could buy with $4.

He could buy 2 dollar toys for every 2 dollars he has, so:
Toys bought = Amount of money / Price per toy

Toys bought = $4 / $2

Toys bought = 2

So, he could buy only 2 more 2 dollar toys after buying the game.

                    question:
                     Oliver is at the library helping put away books. There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of books left for Oliver.
Since the librarian took 10 books, there are 46 total books - 10 taken = <<46-10=36>>36 books left for Oliver.

Step 2: Determine how many books can fit on one shelf.
We're given that Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf.

Step 3: Determine how many shelves Oliver will need.
To find the number of shelves required, divide the total number of books left for Oliver by the number of books that can fit on one shelf. So, 36 books / 4 books/shelf = <<36/4=9>>9 shelves.

However, we might want to round up in case there is a situation where there's one or two books leftover that would require an extra shelf anyway. Rounding up to the nearest whole number would ensure Oliver has enough shelves for all the books. Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is: 10 shelves}

However, based on calculations, it would actually be 9 shelves that can accommodate all the books exactly. Rounding up to 10 is a small increase in cost and space if that matters in the library, but it is unnecessary. This is a case where 1 shelf more than what is strictly needed would not make a significant difference.</s>",9

                    question:
                     Luke was putting his spare change into piles. He had 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes. If each pile had 3 coins in it, how many coins did he have total? 
                 [/INST] To find the total number of coins Luke has, we first need to find out how many coins are in each pile of quarters and dimes, and then multiply that number by the number of piles for each type of coin.

1. We know that each pile has 3 coins in it. So, the number of coins in one pile of quarters is 3. The number of coins in one pile of dimes is also 3.

2. Luke has 5 piles of quarters. So, the total number of coins in all the piles of quarters is:
    Number of coins in quarters = Number of piles * Coins per pile
    = 5 * 3
    = 15

3. Luke also has 5 piles of dimes. So, the total number of coins in all the piles of dimes is:
    Number of coins in dimes = Number of piles * Coins per pile
    = 5 * 3
    = 15

4. To find the total number of coins Luke has, we add the number of coins in quarters and dimes:
    Total number of coins = Coins in quarters + Coins in dimes
    = 15 + 15
    = 30

The final answer is: Luke has a total of 30 coins.</s>",30

                     Gwen and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Gwen recycled 5 pounds and her friends recycled 13 pounds, how many points did they earn? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many points Gwen earned for recycling 5 pounds.
Since they earn one point for every 3 pounds recycled, we need to find out how many 3-pound increments are in 5 pounds.

5 pounds ÷ 3 pounds/increment = 1 increment + remainder

1.6666667 increments (rounded to 7 decimal places)

However, since we can only earn whole points, we cannot earn a fraction of a point for recycling. Therefore, Gwen has recycled enough for 1 point.

Step 2: Determine how many points her friends earned for recycling 13 pounds.
Her friends recycled 13 pounds, which is equivalent to 4.3333333 increments (rounded to 7 decimal places) based on our calculation from Step 1. Since they earn one point for every 3 pounds, they have recycled enough for 1.3333333 points.

Since we cannot earn a fraction of a point, they actually earned 1 point.

Step 3: Add the points earned by both Gwen and her friends to find the total points earned.

Total points = Points earned by Gwen + Points earned by her friends
Total points = 1 + 1
Total points = 2

Step 2: He received 16 dollars for his birthday.
So, George had 30 + 16 = <36> dollars after receiving the birthday money.

Step 2: Each cage has 8 parrots, so the number of parrots in the pet store is:  number of cages * parrots per cage
= 4 * 8
= 32 parrots

Step 3: Each cage also has 2 parakeets, so the number of parakeets in the pet store is: number of cages * parakeets per cage
= 4 * 2
= 8 parakeets

Step 4: To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we add the number of parrots and parakeets:
total birds = number of parrots + number of parakeets

14 boxes * 6 pieces/box = 84 pieces {This is the initial number of pieces Kaleb had}.

Step 2: Kaleb gave 5 boxes to his little brother. Since each box has 6 pieces, the number of pieces given to his brother is:
5 boxes * 6 pieces/box = 30 pieces.

Step 3: To find out how many pieces Kaleb still has, we subtract the number of pieces given to his brother from the initial number of pieces he had:

                    question:
                     Robin uploaded 31 pictures from her phone and 5 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 9 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many pictures were in each album, we need to determine the number of pictures in each group (from phone or camera) and then divide that number by the number of albums.

First, let's find the total number of pictures Robin uploaded to Facebook: 31 pictures from her phone + 5 pictures from her camera = ³¹ + ⅘ = ³�ei + ⅗ = ³₂₆ ≈ 32.6 pictures

Since she couldn't upload a fraction of a picture, and each album must contain an equal number of pictures, we need to round up the total number of pictures to make the final number of albums divisible by 9. To do this, we need to add 2 more pictures (for a total of 35), making the final number of pictures ³³.

Now, let's divide this number by the number of albums (9): ³³ ÷ ⁹ = ³³/⁹ × ¹⁰/¹ = ³³ × ¹/⁹ × ¹⁰/¹ = ³³ × ¹/⁹ × ¹⁰ = ³³ × ¹⁰/⁹ = ³³ × (10/9) ≈ ³⅗. This result means that each album can hold roughly 3.71 pictures. However, since she can't add a fraction of a picture to an album, we need to choose the smallest number above this value, which is 4. Also, to keep the number of pictures equal in all albums, we need to make the number of pictures from her phone or camera to be a multiple of 9. Given she had 31 pictures from her phone and that number is not a multiple of 9, she might need to add some pictures from her camera to make the total number of pictures a multiple of 9. For instance, if she adds 7 more pictures from her camera, she will have a total of 39 pictures (31 + 7), which is a multiple of 9. So, in this scenario, each album would hold approximately 4 pictures.

{The final answer is ≈ 4 pictures per album.}

Please note that we had to make some assumptions and approximations during this calculation, as the actual number of pictures she had from her camera was not specified. However, the calculations and steps showed here represent an attempt to find the answer that meets the given constraints.</s>",4

Mike made 69 dollars mowing lawns.
He spent 24 dollars on new mower blades.

So,

= 45 dollars

Step 2: Determine how many 5 dollar games Mike can buy with the remaining money.

He has 45 dollars left.
Each game costs 5 dollars.

So,
Number of games = Money left / Cost per game
= 45 dollars / 5 dollars/game
= 9 games

First, let's find out how many cookies in total Maria has:
5 chocolate chip cookies + 19 oatmeal cookies = 24 cookies

Next, we need to determine how many baggies Maria can make using these 24 cookies since each baggie contains 8 cookies:

Total number of cookies / Cookies per baggie = Number of baggies
24 cookies / 8 cookies per baggie = 3 baggies with only chocolate chip cookies

However, since Maria has both chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies, she can make more baggies using all the cookies:

Total number of chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies / Cookies per baggie = Number of mixed cookie baggies
(5 chocolate chip cookies + 19 oatmeal cookies) / 8 cookies per baggie = 3.625 baggies

As we cannot create a fraction of a baggie, Maria can only make 3 full baggies with 8 cookies each and still have some leftover cookies.

First, let's find out how many books are on each mystery shelf:
Number of books on each mystery shelf = Number of books per shelf (given as 8)

Next, let's find out how many mystery books there are in total:
Number of mystery books = Number of mystery shelves * Number of books per mystery shelf
Number of mystery books = 5 shelves * 8 books/shelf
Number of mystery books = 40 books

Similarly, let's find out how many books are on each picture shelf and then find the total number of picture books:
Number of books on each picture shelf = Number of books per shelf
Number of books on each picture shelf = 8 books

Number of picture books = Number of picture shelves * Number of books per picture shelf

                 [/INST] First, let's calculate how many cards John has in total. He has 8 new cards and 16 old cards, so:

Total cards = New cards + Old cards
                  = 8 + 16
                  = 24

Next, let's determine how many cards fit on one page in the binder. John can put 3 cards on each page, so:

Cards per page = Number of cards per group
                       = 3

Now, let's find out how many pages John needs to store all his cards:

Pages needed = Total cards / Cards per page
                     = 24 / 3

Since we can't divide by 3 exactly, we'll need to round up to the nearest whole number to account for all of John's cards:

Pages needed = ⌈24/3⌋ = 9

However, since John can only put 3 cards on a page, he can only fit 81 cards (3 x 27) in a 9-page binder. Since John has 24 cards, there's a discrepancy.

It seems that John cannot put all 24 cards in a 3-card-per-page binder. Instead, he can put the new cards in the binder, but he would need a different binder or additional binders for the old cards. {The final answer is 3 pages for the new cards, and additional pages for the old cards.}</s>",8

                 [/INST] To determine how many more cups of flour Isabel needs, we first need to find out how many cups of flour she has used and how many she needs in total.

1. Isabel baked 3 brownies, and she used 5 cups of flour on each brownie. So, she has already used: 3 brownies * 5 cups of flour/brownie = 15 cups of flour.

2. Isabel needs a total of 5 brownies for her party, so she needs to make 2 more brownies. Therefore, she will need an additional: 2 brownies * 5 cups of flour/brownie = 10 cups of flour.

3. To find the total amount of flour Isabel has used and still needs, we add the flour she's already used to the flour she still needs: 15 cups of flour (used) + 10 cups of flour (needed) = 25 cups of flour.

{The final answer is: Isabel needs 10 more cups of flour.}

Alternatively, Isabel could calculate the amount of flour she needs for her entire party (5 brownies * 5 cups of flour/brownie = 25 cups of flour) and then subtract the amount she's already used (25 cups of flour total - 15 cups of flour used = 10 cups of flour needed).

                 [/INST] To find out how many points Bianca and her friends earned for recycling paper, we first need to calculate how many points Bianca earned alone, and then add the points her friends earned.

1. Points earned by Bianca: She recycled 24 pounds, and for every 3 pounds she recycled, she earned one point. So, the number of points she earned is given by: Number of points = Pounds recycled / Pounds per point

= 24 pounds / 3 pounds per point

= 8 points

2. Points earned by Bianca's friends: They recycled 3 pounds, and they earned one point for every 3 pounds they recycled. So, the number of points they earned is: Points = Pounds recycled by friends / Pounds per point for friends

= 3 pounds / 3 pounds per point

The chef had 8 chicken wings cooked before the group arrived, and they cooked 10 more. So the total number of chicken wings is:
8 (cooked before) + 10 (cooked for the group) = 18 chicken wings

Step 2: Determine how many chicken wings each person received.
Since there were 3 friends in the group, we'll divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends to find out how many wings each person got:
18 (total wings) / 3 (friends) = 6 wings per person

                     There school's baseball team had 2 new players and 6 returning players. If the coach put them into groups with 4 players in each group, how many groups would there be? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many groups there would be with 4 players in each group and a total of 8 players (2 new players and 6 returning players), we simply divide the total number of players by the number of players per group:

Groups = Total number of players / Players per group

{The final answer is: Groups = 8 / 4}

{The final answer is: Groups = 2}

However, this means that there would only be one group with 8 players. Since the coach intends to make smaller groups of 4 players each, we need to adjust our calculation.

Instead, we should divide the number of players that can be put in one group (4) into the total number of players (8) as many times as possible, while then adding the remaining players to the last group:

Number of groups = Quotient of Total number of players / Players per group + 1

{The final answer is: Number of groups = 2 (groups of 4) + 1 (remaining players)}

{The final answer is: Number of groups = 3}

Therefore, the coach would need to divide the team into 3 groups: 2 groups of 4 players, and an additional group with the remaining 2 players.</s>",2

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how long it takes to paint all 6 rooms.
Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, then the total time to paint all 6 rooms would be:
6 rooms * 5 hours/room = 30 hours

Step 2: The painter has already painted 2 rooms. So we need to find out how long it took him to paint those rooms.
2 rooms * 5 hours/room = 10 hours

Step 3: Now, we need to find out how long it will take the painter to paint the remaining 4 rooms.
Since 2 rooms have already been painted and it took 10 hours, then the remaining 4 rooms will take:
4 rooms * 5 hours/room = 20 hours

Step 4: To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest, we can subtract the time already spent from the total time needed.
20 hours (total time for remaining rooms) - 10 hours (time already spent) = 10 more hours

{The final answer is: The painter will need an additional 10 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.}</s>",20

                    question:
                     A waiter had 22 customers in his section. If 14 of them left and the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table, how many tables did he have? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many customers were left after 14 had departed.
22 customers (total) - 14 customers (departed) = <<22-14=8>>8 customers remaining.

Step 2: Determine how many people sit at each table. We know that.
Each table has 4 people.

Step 3: Determine how many tables are needed to accommodate the remaining customers.
Number of tables = Total number of people / People per table
Number of tables = 8 customers / 4 people per table = <<8/4=2>>2 tables.

However, this answer does not make sense in the context of the problem since we were told that the remaining tables had 4 people at each table. This means that we have at least one full table more than what our calculation above suggests. Let's correct our mistake.

Let's assume we have three tables, with two tables having four customers each and one table having the remaining two customers. Therefore:
2 tables with 4 customers each = 2 tables * 4 customers/table = 8 customers
1 table with 2 customers = 2 customers
Total customers = 8 customers + 2 customers = 10 customers

Next, we calculate the number of tables based on our corrected assumption:
Number of tables = Total number of people (10 customers from the calculation above) / People per table (4 people per table) = 10 customers / 4 people/table = 2 tables and 2 extra people

But since the waiter had exactly 22 customers in total, and we accounted for 10 customers, there must be another table with 4 people sitting on it.

Therefore, the final answer is that the waiter had a total of 3 tables, with two of them having 4 people and the third one having 4 people as well. Thus, there were a total of 12 customers in his section.

                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many pieces of clothing are in the remaining loads after one large load. We know that Roger put 48 pieces in one load, so the number of pieces in the remaining loads is:

total pieces of clothing - pieces in one load

{72 pieces of clothing in the remaining loads}

Next, we need to find out how many pieces can go in each of the 9 smaller loads. Since these loads should be equal in size, we divide the number of pieces in the remaining loads by the number of smaller loads:

pieces in one smaller load = total pieces in remaining loads / number of smaller loads

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many books Roger is left with after the librarian takes 2:

Total books to put away = 14
Books taken by librarian = 2
Books left for Roger = Total books - Books taken
                                 = 14 - 2
                                 = 12

Next, we need to determine how many books can fit on one shelf:

 Books per shelf = 3

Finally, we can calculate how many shelves Roger will need by dividing the number of books he's left with by the number of books that fit on one shelf:

Shelves needed = Number of books / Books per shelf
                      = 12 / 3
                      ≈ 4

1. Bianca picked 39 tulips.
2. She also picked 49 roses.
3. So in total, Bianca picked 39 tulips + 49 roses = 88 flowers.

However, she only used 81 of the flowers. Therefore, we can find the number of extra flowers she picked by subtracting the number of flowers she used from the total number of flowers she picked:

Extra flowers = Total flowers picked - Flowers used

                     A florist had 5 roses. If she sold 3 of them and then later picked 34 more, how many roses would she have? 
                 [/INST] The florist started with 5 roses. She sold 3 of them, so we need to subtract the number of sold roses from the initial number.

Initial number of roses = 5
Number of roses sold = 3

Difference = Initial number - Number sold
= 5 - 3
= 2

So the florist had 2 roses left after selling 3. Then she picked up 34 more roses.

Number of roses picked up = 34

To find the total number of roses the florist has now, we add the initial number (5) to the number she picked up (34).

Total number of roses = Initial number + Number picked up
= 5 + 34
= 39

{The final answer is 39 roses}.</s>",36

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of sodas Cody bought.
Regular sodas = 4
Diet sodas = 44
Total sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
Total sodas = 4 + 44
Total sodas = 48

Step 2: determine how many sodas can be stored on each shelf.
Each shelf can hold 6 sodas.

Step 3: Calculate the number of shelves needed to store all the sodas.
Number of shelves = Total sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
Number of shelves = 48 / 6
Number of shelves = 8

Step 4: Round up if necessary since you can't split a shelf.
Since Cody can't split a shelf, he will need 9 shelves to store all of his sodas.

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups the schools debate team can make when splitting into groups of 9, we first need to find the total number of team members and then divide by the group size.

1. The total number of team members is 26 boys + 46 girls = 72 members.
2. We want to find out how many groups with 9 members each can be formed.
3. To calculate the number of groups, we divide the total number of team members by the number of team members per group: 72 / 9
4. Doing the calculation: 8 groups with a remainder of 4. However, we cannot form a group with only 4 team members since a group should have at least 9 members.
5. Since we cannot use the remaining 4 team members to form another group, the final answer is {The number of groups is 8}.

Therefore, they can make 8 groups of 9 team members each from the schools debate team.</s>",8

                    question:
                     There school's baseball team had 12 new players and 44 returning players. If the coach put them into groups with 8 players in each group, how many groups would there be? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many groups there would be with 8 players in each group, we first need to determine the total number of players. We have 12 new players and 44 returning players.

Step 1: Find the total number of players.
Total players = New players + Returning players
Total players = 12 + 44
Total players = 56

Step 2: Divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group to find the number of groups.
Number of groups = Total players / Players per group
Number of groups = 56 / 8

Step 3: Calculate the quotient of the division and find the remainder (if any) using long division or a calculator. This will give us the exact number of groups and tell us if we need to form additional smaller groups to accommodate any remaining players.

In this case, 56 divided by 8 equals a quotient of 7 with a remainder of 0. So, no additional smaller groups are needed.

Step 4: State the final answer.
{The final answer is 7 groups with 8 players in each group, for a total of 56 players.}

So, when forming baseball teams of 8 players each for the school's team, there will be 7 groups with a total of 56 players.</s>",7

                 [/INST] To find out how many boxes Luke used, we first need to determine how many games he had left after selling 39.

Step 1: Find the number of games Luke had after selling 39.
Luke started with 57 games and sold 39.
number of games = initial number of games - number of games sold
number of games = 57 - 39
number of games = 18

Step 2: Determine how many games are in each box.
We know that Luke put 2 games into each box.

Step 3: Calculate the number of boxes Luke needs based on the remaining games.
To find the number of boxes, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box.
number of boxes = number of remaining games / games per box
number of boxes = 18 / 2
number of boxes = 9

However, since Luke rounded up to the nearest full box in his packing process, he would have needed an additional box for the remaining 2 games. Therefore, {The final answer is 10}.</s>",9

                 [/INST] To find out how many bad carrots there were in total, we first need to determine the number of good carrots that Faye and her mother picked. We're given that 12 of the carrots were good.

Next, we can find the number of bad carrots by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked.

Step 1: Find the number of good carrots picked by Faye.
- Faye picked 23 carrots

Step 2: Find the number of good carrots picked by Faye's mom.
- Faye's mom picked 5 carrots

Step 3: Find the total number of good carroats picked.
- Good carrots picked by Faye = 23
- Good carrots picked by Faye's mom = 5
- Total good carrots picked = 23 + 5 = ≤28

Since we know there were only 12 good carrots in total, this means there were an equal number of bad carrots:

Step 4: Find the number of bad carrots.
- Good carrots picked = 12
- Bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Good carrots picked
- Bad carrots = (Faye's carrots + Faye's mom's carrots) - Good carrots picked
- Bad carrots = (23 + 5) - 12 = ≤10

Since Faye picked one more carrot than the number of good carrots (23 instead of 22), we need to account for the extra bad carrot:

Step 5: Find the actual number of bad carrots.
- Faye picked one more carrot than good carrots, so there is an extra bad carrot
- Total bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Good carrots picked - (Excess carrot picked by Faye)
- Total bad carrots = 23 + 5 - 12 - 1 = 7

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of flowers Isabel had after the wilting.
Isabel picked 66 flowers for the wedding. Ten of them wilted before the wedding, so she had:
66 flowers (picked) - 10 flowers (wilted) = 56 flowers left

Step 2: Determine how many bouquets Isabel could make with the remaining flowers.
Each bouquet requires 8 flowers. So, to find the number of bouquets Isabel can make with the remaining 56 flowers, divide the number of flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet:
56 flowers / 8 flowers/bouquet = 7 bouquets with a remainder of 2 flowers
Since Isabel cannot make a fraction of a bouquet, she can only make 6 more bouquets with the remaining 2 flowers. Thus, she can make a total of:
56 flowers / 8 flowers/bouquet = 7 bouquets

The final answer is: Isabel can still make 7 bouquets for the wedding.</s>",7

- Number of Siamese cats sold: 38 cats (initial number) - 
- Number of Siamese cats left: _______
- Number of House cats sold: 25 cats (initial number) - _______
- Number of House cats left: _______

 calculations for Siamese cats: 38 (initial) - ------ = ---- (sold) => ------ (remain)
 => 38-45 = -7 (this result is incorrect, it means a negative number of cats, which is not possible)

                    question:
                     A waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 39 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush he added another 12 customers. If 49 of the customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip? 
                 [/INST] Let's calculate the number of customers who left a tip:

1. First, we need to find out how many customers the waiter had in total during the lunch rush.
2. The waiter had 39 customers initially, and then 12 more customers joined during the rush.
3. Therefore, the waiter served a total of 39 + 12 = <<39+12=51>>51 customers.
4. We know that 49 of these customers didn't leave a tip.
5. To find the number of customers who did leave a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't tip from the total number of customers.
6. So, the number of customers who left a tip is 51 - 49 = <<51-49=2>>2.

{The final answer is 2 customers left a tip.}</s>",2

                    question:
                     The cafeteria had 50 apples. For lunch they handed out 5 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 5 apples, how many pies could they make? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: The cafeteria had a total of 50 apples.
Step 2: They gave away 5 apples to students, so there are now 45 applesleft.
Step 3: Each pie requires 5 apples to be made.
Step 4: To find the number of pies they could make with the remaining apples, we divide the number of apples left by the number of apples needed for each pie:
Number of pies = Total apples left / Apples per pie
Number of pies = 45 / 5

Step 5: The result of the division is 9 with a remainder of 0. However, since we cannot make a pie with just a remainder, we can only make 9 actual pies.

{The final answer is: They could make 9 pies.}</s>",9

                    question:
                     While playing a trivia game, Frank answered 3 questions correct in the first half and 2 questions correct in the second half. If each question was worth 3 points, what was his final score? 
                 [/INST] To find Frank's final score, we need to find out how many points he earned in each half of the game and then add those totals together.

First, Frank answered 3 questions correctly in the first half. since each question was worth 3 points, we can find the number of points he earned in the first half by multiplying the number of correct answers by the points per question:

Points in first half = Number of correct answers in first half * Points per question
                              = 3 questions answered correctly * 3 points per question
                              = 9 points

Next, Frank answered 2 questions correctly in the second half:

Points in second half = Number of correct answers in second half * Points per question
                                 = 2 questions answered correctly * 3 points per question
                                 = 6 points

To find Frank's total score, we simply add the points he earned in each half:

Final score = Points in first half + Points in second half
                    = 9 points + 6 points
                    = 15 points

Therefore, the final answer is: Frank's final score was 15 points.</s>",15

                     Zoe was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 8 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 4 scarves and 6 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Zoe have total? 
                 [/INST] To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing Zoe has, we first need to find out how many scarves and mittens are in each box, and then multiply that by the number of boxes she found.

1. number of scarves in each box = 4
2. number of mittens in each box = 6

3. To find the total number of scarves Zoe has, we multiply the number of scarves in each box by the number of boxes:
   number of scarves = scarves per box * number of boxes
   = 4 * 8
   = 32
   {So, Zoe has 32 scarves}.

4. To find the total number of mittens Zoe has, we do the same calculation:
   number of mittens = mittens per box * number of boxes
   = 6 * 8
   = 48
   {So, Zoe has 48 mittens}.

5. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing Zoe has, we add the number of scarves and mittens together:
   number of winter clothing = scarves + mittens
   = 32 + 48
   = 78

1. Frank bought 3 decks, and each deck costs 7 dollars. So, Frank spent:
3 decks * $7/deck = $21

2. His friend bought 2 decks, and each deck also costs 7 dollars. So, his friend spent:
2 decks * $7/deck = $14

3. To find out how much they spent in total, we add Frank's expenses and his friend's expenses:
$21 (Frank's expense) + $14 (his friend's expense) = $35

Sam had to wash:
Short sleeve shirts: 40
Long sleeve shirts: 23
Total shirts: 40 + 23 = 63

He washed 29 of them before school started. So, to find out how many shirts he didn't wash, we subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts:

Total shirts: 63
Shirts washed: 29
Shirts not washed: 63 - 29 = 34

{The final answer is: Sam didn't wash 34 shirts.}
