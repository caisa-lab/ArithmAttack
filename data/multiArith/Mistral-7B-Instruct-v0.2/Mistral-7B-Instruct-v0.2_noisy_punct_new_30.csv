                    question:
                     Paige ; had 11 songs on ? her mp3 player. . If she deleted 9 , old , songs ? from it and then , added 8 new songs, how many songs does she , have on ! her mp3 ! player? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player initially.

Step 2: She deleted 9 old songs from her mp3 player, so the number of songs on her player decreased by 9.

Math: 11 (initial songs) - 9 (deleted songs) -> 2 songs

Step 3: Then, she added 8 new songs to her mp3 player.

Math: 2 (initial remaining songs) + 8 (new songs) -> 10 songs

Step 4: Therefore, the number of songs on Paige's mp3 player is now 10 songs.

{The final answer is: 10 songs}</s>",10

                    question:
                     There were ! 39 girls and ? 4 boys trying ; out ; for the schools ? basketball team. If only ; 26 of : them got called ! back, how many students didn't ! make the cut? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we first need to determine how many students were tried out for the basketball team in total. We know that there were 39 girls and 4 boys.

Total number of students tried out = Number of girls + Number of boys
= 39 + 4
= 43

Next, we're told that only 26 students got called back. We can find out how many students didn't make the cut by subtracting the number of students who made it from the total number of students tried out.

Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students tried out - Number of students who made it
= 43 - 26
= 17

So, {The final answer is 17 students didn't make the cut}.</s>",17

                 [/INST] Step 1: Faye started with 34 coloring books. (Given)

Step 2: She gave away 3 coloring books. So, she had 34 - 3 = 31 coloring books left.

Step 3: Then she bought 48 more coloring books. So, Faye now has 31 (her initial books) + 48 (the new books) = 79 coloring books in total.

{The final answer is: Faye has 79 coloring books}.</s>",79

                 [/INST] Step 1: The school cafeteria had 23 apples.

Step 2: They used 20 apples to make lunch for the students.
So, number of apples left = Initial number of apples - Apples used
= 23 - 20
= 3 apples

Step 3: They bought 6 more apples.
So, number of apples left = number of apples left after using 20 apples + Apples bought
= 3 + 6
= 9 apples

{The final answer is: The school cafeteria had 9 apples left.}</s>",9

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of enemies you did not defeat.
You stated that there are 11 enemies in a level and you only defeated 8 of them. so the number of enemies you did not defeat is:
11 (total enemies) - 8 (enemies defeated) = 3 enemies

Step 2: Find out how many points you get for defeating one enemy.
The question states that defeating one enemy gives you 9 points.

Step 3: Calculate the points earned for defeating the enemies you did defeat.
points for defeating enemies = number of enemies defeated * points per enemy defeat
points for defeating enemies = 8 enemies * 9 points
points for defeating enemies = 72 points

Step 4: Find out how many points you would have earned if you had defeated all the enemies.
points for defeating all enemies = total number of enemies * points per enemy defeat
points for defeating all enemies = 11 enemies * 9 points
points for defeating all enemies = 99 points

Step 5: Subtract the points you earned from the total points you would have earned to find out how many points you missed out on.
points missed = points for defeating all enemies - points for defeating enemies
points missed = 99 points - 72 points
points missed = 27 points

The final answer is: You would have earned 27 more points if you had defeated all the enemies in the level.</s>",72

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's calculate the number of roses April sold during the sale.
April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left. So she sold 13 - 4 = ➋ nine roses➏.

Step 2: We know that each rose was sold at a discounted price of $4.

Step 3: To find out how much money April earned, we need to find the total sales revenue obtained from the sale of these nine roses.

Step 4: Sales revenue = (Number of roses) x (Price per rose)
= 9 x $4
= $36

The final answer is: {April earned $36 from the sale of discounted roses}.</s>",36

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find out how many shirts Ned washing before school started.
He washed 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts.
Total shirts washed = Short sleeve shirts + Long sleeve shirts
Total shirts washed = 9 + 21
Total shirts washed = 30

Step 2: Ned had 29 shirts washed by the time school started. So, we need to find out how many were not washed.
Shirts not washed = Total shirts needed - Shirts washed
Shirts not washed = 29 + 9 (short sleeve shirts) + 21 (long sleeve shirts) - 30 (shirts washed)

Step 3: Calculate the difference.
Shirts not washed = 49 - 30
Shirts not washed = 19

The final answer is: Ned did not wash 19 shirts.</s>",1

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many people attended the luncheon.
47 people were invited, but 7 didn't show up, so 40 people attended the luncheon.

Step 2: Calculate how many tables were needed to seat all the attendees.
Each table holds 5 people, so we need to find out how many tables are required to seat 40 people. We can do this by dividing the number of attendees (40) by the number of people each table can seat (5).

Step 3: Calculate the number of tables needed.
Tables needed = Attendees / People per table
= 40 / 5
= 8 tables (with a remainder of 0)

Therefore, the company would need 8 tables to seat all the attendees at the luncheon.

{The final answer is: 8 tables}</s>",8
"!  Tom had 5 books. ; If he ; sold . 4 : of them : and used the money he earned to buy 38 new , books, how many books would Tom have? ! ","<s> [INST]

                 [/INST] Step 1: Tom started with 5 books.
Step 2: He sold 4 of them, so the number of books Tom has left after selling is:
5 books (Tom's initial books) - 4 books (Tom sold) = 1 book

Step 3: Tom used the money from selling the 4 books to buy new books. We know that Tom bought 38 new books with this money.

Step 4: To find the total number of books Tom now has, we add the number of books he had left after selling to the number of new books he bought:

Initially had: 5 books
Sold: -4 books
Left after selling: 1 book
Bought new: 38 books

Total number of books Tom has now: 1 book (initially) + 38 books (bought new) = 39 books

":  ! For a birthday party Jerry bought . 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If . his fridge would only hold ! 9 on each shelf, how many : shelves ? would , he fill up? , ","<s> [INST] 
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    :  ! For a birthday party Jerry bought . 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If . his fridge would only hold ! 9 on each shelf, how many : shelves ? would , he fill up? , 
                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Jerry needs to fill up, we first need to calculate how many sodas he has in total and then divide that number by the number of sodas that can be stored on each shelf.

Total number of sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
Total number of sodas = 41 + 22
Total number of sodas = 63

Now, let's calculate how many shelves Jerry needs.

Shelves needed = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
Shelves needed = 63 / 9
Shelves needed = 7

However, it looks like we might have made a mistake in our calculation, as 7 does not seem like a good answer given the number of sodas Jerry has. Let's double-check our calculations:

Total number of sodas = 41 + 22 = 63
Shelves needed = 63 / 9

Since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, let's add one more shelf to ensure that all the sodas can fit:

Shelves needed = 7

Therefore, Jerry would need 7 shelves to store all of his sodas. {The final answer is 7 shelves.}</s>",7

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many pieces of candy Debby's sister had. Since Debby had 32 pieces and they combined their candies, we can find out how many pieces Debby's sister had by subtracting Debby's pieces from their total.

Total pieces of candy = Debby's pieces + Debby's sister's pieces
32 (Debby's pieces) + X (Debby's sister's pieces) = 74 (Total pieces of candy)
X = 74 - 32 = 42 (Debby's sister's pieces)

Step 2: Determine how many pieces they ate on the first night. They ate 35 pieces combined.

Step 3: Subtract the number of pieces they ate from the total number of pieces they had initially.

Total pieces = 74 (from Step 1)
Pieces eaten = 35

Remaining pieces = Total pieces - Pieces eaten

Remaining pieces = 74 - 35

The final answer is: They have 39 pieces of candy remaining.</s>",39

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find out how many seeds Emily planted in total. We know she started with 41 seeds and planted 29 in the big garden.

Total seeds planted = Seeds in big garden + Seeds in small gardens

Step 2: We know that she planted 29 seeds in the big garden. So the number of seeds in each small garden can be found as follows:

Number of seeds in each small garden = Total number of seeds - Seeds in big garden

Step 3: We know that she planted 4 seeds in each small garden. So now we can find the number of small gardens by dividing the total number of seeds in the small gardens by the number of seeds in one small garden.

Number of small gardens = Total seeds in small gardens / Seeds per small garden

Let's calculate the values step by step:

Step 1:
Total seeds planted = 29 (big garden) + x (small gardens)

Step 2:
x = Total seeds in small gardens = 41 - 29
x = 12

Step 3:
Number of small gardens = 12 / 4
Number of small gardens = 3

Therefore, {Emily had 3 small gardens}.</s>",3

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many pieces of candy Emily received in total. We know she received 5 pieces from neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister.
5 pieces from neighbors + 13 pieces from her older sister = 18 pieces of candy in total.

Step 2: Determine how many pieces of candy Emily eats per day. We're told she only eats 9 pieces a day.

Step 3: Calculate how long the candy will last her based on the number of pieces she eats per day and the total number of pieces she has.
Divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day.
18 pieces of candy / 9 pieces per day = Approximately 2 days (since she can't eat a fraction of a piece).

{The final answer is: The candy would last Emily approximately 2 days.}</s>",2

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of books Mike is left with to put away.
The total number of books is 82, and a librarian took 10 books away, so Mike is left with:

82 (total books) - 10 (books taken by librarian) = 72 books

Step 2: Determine how many books Mike can put on one shelf.
Mike can fit 9 books on one shelf.

Step 3: Calculate the number of shelves Mike needs.
Divide the number of books Mike has left to put away by the number of books Mike can fit on one shelf:

72 (books Mike has) / 9 (books per shelf) = 8 shelves (rounded up due to having a remainder)

To find the exact number of shelves, we can also calculate the number of books that can fit on 8 shelves:

8 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 72 books

So, the final answer is: Mike will need 8 shelves to put away all 72 books.</s>",8

Step 2: To find out how long it takes to install the remaining 6 windows (14 total windows minus the 8 that have already been installed), we can use the given information:

Time to install one window = 8 hours
Number of windows to be installed = 6

Step 3: Multiply the time it takes to install one window by the number of windows that need to be installed to find the total time it takes to install them all.

Total time = (Time to install one window) x (Number of windows to be installed)

Total time = 8 hours x 6 windows

Step 2: They threw away 25 old oranges, so that number is subtracted from the initial number.
40 (initial number) - 25 (number of old oranges thrown away) = 15 oranges remaining from the old ones

Step 3: They put 21 new oranges in the bin.
Step 4: To find the total number of oranges in the bin, we add the remaining old oranges and the new oranges.
15 (remaining old oranges) + 21 (new oranges) = 36 oranges in the bin

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We have 7 customers in total.
2. 5 out of these 7 customers didn't leave a tip.
3. The remaining 2 customers left a tip of $3 each.

First, we need to find out how many customers actually left a tip. We know there are 7 customers in total and 5 of them didn't tip, so:

Number of tippers = Total number of customers - Number of non-tippers
= 7 - 5
= 2

Next, we want to find out how much money the waiter earned from the tippers. We know each tipper left $3:

Total tips = Number of tippers * Tip amount

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that there are 4 friends in the group and the chef had cooked 9 chicken wings before they arrived. So, the chef had cooked a total of 9 * 4 = <<9*4=36>>36 wings before the friends arrived.

Step 2: The friends ordered and the chef cooked 7 more chicken wings for them. So, the total number of chicken wings that were cooked is 36 (before the friends arrived) + 7 (for the friends) = <<36+7=43>>43 wings.

Step 3: It is given that each person got the same amount of chicken wings. So, we need to find out how many wings each person got by dividing the total number of wings by the number of people.

Step 4: Therefore, the number of chicken wings each person gotten is Total number of wings / Number of people = 43 / 4 = <<43/4=10.75>>10.75 (approximately).

However, since we cannot give out a fraction of a chicken wing, the chef would have had to adjust the serving sizes accordingly, for example by cooking one more or fewer chicken wing.

{The final answer is: Each person would have gotten approximately 11 chicken wings, but due to the fractional value, the actual amount served may vary.}</s>",4

John earned $8 for each lawn, so he would have earned $8 x 15 = $120 if he had mowed all 15 lawns.

Step 3: Deduct the money John didn't earn from forgetting to mow 7 lawns.
John didn't mow 7 lawns, so he didn't earn $8 x 7 = $56 for those lawns.

- The builder has installed 6 windows.

Windows installed = 6
Number of windows needed = 9

Remaining windows = Total windows needed - Windows installed

Now we have to find out how long it takes to install 3 windows. We're given that it takes 6 hours to install one window.

To install 3 windows, it would take:

                 [/INST] To find out how many candies Frank can buy with the tickets he won, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out the total number of tickets Frank won.
2. Subtract the number of tickets used while trying to buy candies.
3. Divide the remaining tickets by the number of tickets required to buy one candy.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

Step 1: Frank won 33 tickets while playing 'whack a mole' and 9 tickets while playing 'skee ball'. So, the total number of tickets Frank won is:

33 (whack a mole) + 9 (skee ball) = 42 tickets

Step 2: We're told that Frank was trying to buy candy that cost 6 tickets a piece. So, the number of tickets used to buy one candy is 6. We'll subtract the number of tickets Frank used to buy candies from the total number of tickets he won to find out how many candies he can buy with the remaining tickets.

Total tickets Frank won = 42
Tickets per candy = 6

Number of candies Frank can buy = Total tickets / Tickets per candy
= 42 / 6
= 7

Since Frank cannot buy a fraction of a candy, we need to verify if there are enough tickets left to buy one more candy. Let's see:

Remaining tickets = Total tickets - (Number of candies * Tickets per candy)
= 42 - (7 * 6)
= 42 - 42
= 0

It turns out that Frank doesn't have enough tickets left to buy one more candy. Therefore, Frank can buy a maximum of 6 candies with the tickets he won.

So, {The final answer is: Frank can buy 6 candies.}</s>",7

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the number of adults and kids in the group.
Given that there are 13 people in the group and 9 of them are kids. So, the number of adults is: 13 (total people) - 9 (kids) = 4

Step 2: Calculate the cost of adults' meals.
Cost of one adult meal = $7
Number of adults = 4
So, the cost of adult meals = $7 * 4 = $28

{The number of kids is given and their meals are free, so the cost of kids' meals is $0.}

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the group.
Total cost = Cost of adult meals + Cost of kids' meals
Since the kids' meals are free, the total cost equals to: $28 (cost of adult meals) + $0 (cost of kids' meals) = $28

                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves were used, we first need to determine how many bears are now in stock at the store.

Step 1: Find the total number of bears in the store.
A toy store had 17 giant stuffed bears in stock. They received a shipment with 10 bears, so:
Total number of bears = 17 + 10 = 27

Step 2: Calculate the number of bears on each shelf.
There are 9 bears on each shelf.

Step 3: Determine the number of shelves needed to hold all the bears.
Number of shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears per shelf
Number of shelves = 27 / 9

Step 4: Simplify the fraction to find the number of shelves.
We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.
Number of shelves = (27 ÷ 3) / (9 ÷ 3) = 9

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, the store must have used an additional shelf to accommodate the remaining 3 bears (27 % 9 = 3).

Step 5: Add one more shelf to the result from Step 3.
Total number of shelves = Number of shelves calculated + 1
Total number of shelves = 9 + 1 = 10

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's calculate the number of books on the shelves of mystery books. we know that Gwen had 5 shelves for mystery books, and each shelf held exactly 4 books.

number of books on mystery shelves = number of shelves × number of books per shelf

number of books on mystery shelves = 5 ×4
number of books on mystery shelves = 20

Step 2: Next, let's calculate the number of books on the picture book shelves. we know that Gwen had 3 shelves for picture books, and each shelf held exactly 4 books.

number of books on picture books shelves = number of shelves × number of books per shelf

number of books on picture books shelves = 3×4
number of books on picture books shelves = 12

Step 3: Now, we can find the total number of books by adding the number of books on the mystery shelves and the picture books shelves.

total number of books = number of books on mystery shelves + number of books on picture books shelves

total number of books = 20 + 12

 Step 2: Distribute the remaining 35 pictures into 5 albums.
 To find out how many pictures are in each album other than the largest one, we need to divide the total number of remaining pictures (35) by the number of albums (5).
 {35 (remaining pictures) / 5 (number of albums)} = 7 pictures per album

 So, each album except the largest one contains 7 pictures.

1. We have a debate team with a total of 5 boys and 40 girls.
2. The team has a total of 5 boys + 40 girls = 45 members.
3. They want to split into groups of 9 members each.
4. To find out how many groups they can form, we need to divide the total number of members by the number of members in each group and round up to get the number of full groups.
5. So, the number of full groups is given by: Full groups = Total members / Members per group = 45 / 9 = 5
6. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to include one more group to accommodate the remaining members.

2. April started with 9 roses, so the number of roses she sold is:
   9 (initial roses) - 4 (left over) = 5 roses

Therefore, she sold 5 roses.

To find out how much money she earned, we simply multiply the number of roses sold by the price per rose:

                 [/INST] To find out how much money Victor made in two days, we need to calculate his earnings for each day and then add them together. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. We know that Victor made $6 per hour, and he worked for 5 hours on Monday and 5 hours on Tuesday.
2. To find his earnings on each day, we can multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours worked:
   - Earnings on Monday = $6/hour × 5 hours = $30
   - Earnings on Tuesday = $6/hour × 5 hours = $30
3. Now, to find his total earnings for the two days, we simply add up his earnings for each day:
   - Total earnings = $30 (from Monday) + $30 (from Tuesday) = $60

{The final answer is: $60}</s>",60

Megan baked 71 cupcakes. Todd ate 43 of them. So the number of cupcakes left is:
71 (total cupcakes) - 43 (cupcakes Todd ate) = 28 cupcakes

Step 2: Determine how many packages Megan can make with the remaining cupcakes.
Megan puts 7 cups in each package. So the number of packages she can make is:
28 (remaining cupcakes) / 7 (cupcakes per package) = 4 packages

{The final answer is: Megan can make 4 packages with the remaining cupcakes.}</s>",4

step 4: Therefore, the number of lives for the 2 new players is 2 * 6 = 12 lives.

step 5: The initial 2 players were not specified to have a particular number of lives in the problem. So, we cannot include their lives in the calculation at this point.

" Wendy picked 103 flowers for her ; friend’s wedding. . She was , making bouquets with 8 ! flowers in each one. If , 47 of : the ; flowers ! wilted before the wedding, how many ! bouquets could ? she still make? ","<s> [INST]

                    question:
                     Wendy picked 103 flowers for her ; friend’s wedding. . She was , making bouquets with 8 ! flowers in each one. If , 47 of : the ; flowers ! wilted before the wedding, how many ! bouquets could ? she still make? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many bouquets Wendy could make with the remaining flowers.
Since there are 103 flowers and she was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one, we can find the number of bouquets she made before the wilting by dividing the total number of flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet.

Number of bouquets = Total number of flowers / Flowers per bouquet
= 103 / 8
= 13.125

However, since Wendy cannot make a fraction of a bouquet, she can only make 13 bouquets with the 103 flowers in total.

Step 2: Find out how many bouquets she could still make with the non-wilted flowers.
She originally made 13 bouquets, but 47 of them wilted. So, the number of bouquets she could still make is the difference between the number of bouquets she made and the number of bouquets that wilted.

Number of bouquets remaining = Number of bouquets made - Number of bouquets wilted
= 13 - 47/8

To simplify the calculation, we'll determine how many bouquets wilted in terms of the number of flowers in a bouquet.
Since each bouquet had 8 flowers and 47 of them wilted, the total number of flowers that wilted is:

47 * 8 = 376 flowers

Since she had 103 flowers in total and 376 wilted, the number of non-wilted flowers is:

Total flowers - Wilting flowers = Remaining flowers
103 - 376 = -273

However this result is meaningless, as the negative sign means that Wendy had fewer wilted flowers than the actual number of flowers she had. This indicates that our arithmetic was incorrect. Therefore, we need to double-check the calculations or find an alternative way to solve the problem.

To confirm, we can calculate the remaining number of bouquets by:

Number of bouquets remaining = Number of bouquets made - Number of bouquets wilted
= 13 - (Total flowers / Flowers per bouquet) * (Number of bouquets per wilted flower)
= 13 - (103 / 8 ) * (47/8)
= 13 - (13 + 2)
= 10

So the final answer is: Wendy could still make 10 bouquets with the non-wilted flowers.</s>",7

                 [/INST] Step 1: first, we need to find out how many books Adam sold. We know that he sold 19 groups (or ""lots"") of books. Since each group consists of a certain number of books, we need to determine the number of books in each group.

Step 2: The problem mentions that ""Adam had 48 books,"" but it doesn't specify how many books are in each group when Adam sold them. However, we know that he sold 19 groups of them, and after that, he bought 38 new books with the money.

Step 3: To find the number of books in each group, we can use the information given that Adam had 48 books initially and that he bought 38 new books afterwards. Since the difference between the initial and final numbers of books equals the number of books sold in groups (19 groups), we can determine the number of books in each group as:

Number of Books per Group = Initial Number of Books - Final Number of Books - Number of Books Sold in Groups
Number of Books per Group = 48 - 38 - 19
Number of Books per Group = 1Book

So, each group consisted of only one book.

Step 4: Now that we know the number of books in each group, we can determine the total number of books Adam has after selling some and buying new ones.

Total Number of Books = Initial Number of Books - Number of Books Sold in Groups + Number of New Books
Total Number of Books = 48 - (1 * 19) + 38
Total Number of Books = 48 - 19 + 38
Total Number of Books = 65

Total number of people = Number of students * Number of students per van + Number of adults * Number of adults per van

Total number of people = 12 students * 5 students + 3 adults * 5 adults

Total number of people = 60 students + 15 adults = 75 people

Now, we can calculate how many vans are needed:

Number of vans = Total number of people / Number of people per van

Number of vans = 75 people / 5 people per van

Number of vans = 15 vans

Therefore, {The final answer is: They will need 15 vans for the field trip}.</s>",3

                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Tom would fill up, we first need to determine how many sodas he bought in total and then divide that number by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.

Total number of sodas bought by Tom = 4 regular sodas + 52 diet sodas
Total number of sodas = 4 + 52 = 56

Now, we can calculate how many shelves Tom would fill up:
Number of shelves = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
Number of shelves = 56 / 7

Since we can't have a decimal number of shelves, let's round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Tom can store all of his sodas.

Number of shelves = 8

{The final answer is: Tom would fill up 8 shelves in his fridge.}</s>",8

The school cafeteria had 38 apples. They used 20 apples to make lunches for 1 student (each lunch requiring 1 apple). After that, they bought additional apples.

II. Find out how many apples were used to make lunches for the students:
- We know that 1 student required 1 apple, and there were 20 students.
- So, the number of apples used to make lunches for these students is 1 apple per student * 20 students = <<1*20=20>>20 apples.

III. Find out how many apples the cafeteria bought afterwards:
The problem doesn't provide enough information to determine the exact number of apples bought. Let's assume X is the number of apples bought.

IV. Find the total number of apples after using the apples for lunches and buying more:
- Initially, the cafeteria had 38 apples.
- After making lunches for 20 students, they had 38 - 20 = <<38-20=18>>18 apples left.
- They bought X more apples.

V. Determine the total number of apples:
- The cafeteria started with 18 apples and bought X apples afterward.

Luke can carry 4 trays at a time.

Step 2: Find out how many trays he needs to pick up from the first table.
He needs to pick up 20 trays from the first table.

Step 3: Calculate the number of trips Luke needs to make for the trays from the first table.
Number of trips = Total trays / Trays per trip
Number of trips = 20 / 4
Number of trips = 5

So, Luke makes 5 trips to pick up all the trays from the first table.

Step 4: Find out how many trays he needs to pick up from the second table.
He needs to pick up 16 trays from the second table.

Step 5: Calculate the number of trips Luke needs to make for the trays from the second table.

Step 3: They used some apples to make pies. The number of apples used to make one pie is 6.

Step 4: To find out how many pies they could make, we need to divide the number of apples remaining by the number of apples used per pie. So, the number of pies that could be made is 54 / 6.

Step 5: The division of 54 by 6 results in 9 with a remainder of 0. It means that 9 pies can be made using exactly 6 apples each, and the rest 54 - 9 * 6 = 2 apples remain.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of brownies Tiffany needs for her party as x. We know that she baked 8 brownies and each brownie required 8 cups of flour. So, she used:

8 brownies * 8 cups/brownie = 64 cups of flour

However, she needs a total of x cups of flour for her party. We can set up the equation as follows:

64 (her used flour) + y (flour she still needs) = x (total flour needed)

We know that she baked 8 brownies, so x must be a multiple of 8 since each brownie requires a constant amount of flour. Let's find the smallest multiple of 8 that satisfies the requirement:

x = 8 * n (where n is some whole number)

Substituting this into our equation, we get:

64 + y = 8n
y = 8n - 64

Since y represents the amount of flour Tiffany still needs, it must be a positive number. Thus, n > (64/8) = 8.125. Since n must be a whole number, the smallest value that satisfies the requirement is n = 10.

Now, we can find the total amount of flour Tiffany needs:

x = 8n = 8 * 10 = 80

And the amount of flour she still needs:

y = 8n - 64 = 8 * 10 - 64 = 32

So, Tiffany needs to buy an additional 32 cups of flour to make enough brownies for her party. {The final answer is 32 cups}.</s>",72

                     A worksheet had ? 7 problems : on ! it. If ! a teacher had 17 worksheets to grade and had already graded 8 of them, ? how ; many more problems , does she have to . grade? ? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many more problems the teacher needs to grade, we first need to determine how many problems are on each worksheet. The problem states that a worksheet has ""? 7 problems"". This means that we don't know the exact number of problems, only that there are more than 7.

However, we do know that the teacher has graded 8 worksheets, and since each worksheet has more than 7 problems, there must have been at least 8 x 7 = 56 problems graded so far.

Therefore, if we assume that there are exactly n problems on each worksheet, then we can set up the equation:

7 < n  (since we know there are more than 7 problems)
8 x n = 56  (the number of problems graded so far)

Solving for n, we get:

n > 8.22 (rounded up since the number of problems must be a whole number)
n = 9  (the smallest number greater than 8 that satisfies the condition)

So, we have assumed that there are 9 problems on each worksheet. Now we can find out how many more problems the teacher needs to grade:

Total number of problems = Number of worksheets x Number of problems per worksheet
Total number of problems = 17 x 9
Total number of problems = 153

Number of problems graded so far = 8 x 9 = 72

Number of problems to be graded = Total number of problems - Number of problems graded
Number of problems to be graded = 153 - 72
Number of problems to be graded = 81

{The final answer is: The teacher has to grade 81 more problems.}</s>",63

Step 2: Two more players joined, so now we have 8 + 2 = 10 players in total.

Step 3: Each player has 6 lives.

Step 4: To find the total number of lives, we multiply the number of players by the number of lives each player has:
Total lives = Number of players * Lives per player

                 [/INST] The given information states that Cody won 49 tickets at the arcade. He then spent 25 tickets on a beanie, leaving him with the remaining tickets. To find out how many tickets Cody had in total after winning the extra 6 tickets, we need to follow these steps.

Step 1: Find out how many tickets Cody had left after spending 25 tickets on a beanie.
Cody had 49 tickets initially won. He spent 25 tickets, so there are:

Total tickets after spending on beanie = Initial tickets - Spent tickets
Total tickets after spending on beanie = 49 - 25
Total tickets after spending on beanie = 24 tickets

Step 2: Determine how many tickets Cody won afterward to find his total ticket count.
Cody won an additional 6 tickets. So, his new total ticket count is:

Total tickets = Tickets after spending on beanie + New tickets won
Total tickets = 24 + 6
Total tickets = 30

                 [/INST] Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Roger had 25 books.
2. He sold 21 books, so the number of books he had left is: 25 (initial books) - 21 (sold books) = 4 books.
3. Next, he used the money from selling the 21 books to buy 30 new books. So let's find the amount of money Roger earned from selling the books. 21 books * (price per book, let's call it 'p') = 21p
4. Now, let's find the cost of the new books: 30 new books * (price per book, let's call it 'q') = 30q
5. Since Roger used all the money from selling the books to buy new ones, the equation should be: 21p = 30q
6. To find the final number of books Roger had, we first need to know the price of the new books (q). Solving the equation 21p = 30q for q would give us q = (21/30)p = 7/10p.
7. Substituting back, the cost of the new books is 7/10 of the price of each initial book.
8. The total number of books Roger has after selling 21 books and buying 30 new ones is: 4 (initial books left) + 30 (new books) = 34 books.

The final answer is: {Roger would have 34 books}.</s>",34

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem
Wendy was playing a video game, and she had 10 lives. She lost 6 lives in a hard part of the game. In the next level, she would get 37 more lives.

Step 2: Solve for the number of lives Wendy had before losing any
To find out how many lives Wendy had before losing 6 lives, we need to subtract the number of lives she lost from the total number of lives she had when she started that hard part of the game.

Final answer (for the number of lives Wendy had before losing any): 10 (given) - 6 (lost) = 4 lives

Step 3: Find out how many lives Wendy will have in total after gaining the 37 more lives
To find out how many lives Wendy will have in total in the next level, we need to add the number of lives she had before losing any (found in Step 2) and the number of lives she gained (37 more lives).

Final answer (for the number of lives Wendy would have in total): 4 (lives before losing any) + 37 (lives gained) = 41 lives.

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many players the team had in total. We have 48 new players and 6 returning players.

Total number of players = New players + Returning players
Total number of players = 48 + 6
Total number of players = 54

Next, we need to determine how many players should be in each group based on the coach's requirement. Each group should have 6 players.

Now, we need to figure out how many groups can be formed with 6 players in each group. We'll divide the total number of players by the number of players per group.

Number of groups = Total number of players / Players per group
Number of groups = 54 / 6

Number of groups = 9 with a remainder of 2

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to form full groups with the remaining players. So, we'll create one more group with the 2 remaining players.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is 10 groups in total}</s>",9

1. Nancy had 80 files on her computer.
2. She deleted 31 files, leaving her with 80 - 31 = 49 files.
3. Nancy put the rest of the files into folders, each containing 7 files.
4. To find the total number of folders, divide the number of remaining files by the number of files in each folder.

{The final answer is 49 files ÷ 7 files/folder = ≈ 7 folders, but since she can't have a fraction of a folder, she would need to create at least 8 folders to accommodate all 49 files.} Therefore, Nancy ended up with at least 8 folders.

Luke started with 39 games and sold 19 of them. So, he had 39 - 19 = <ins>18 games</ins> left.

Step 2: Determine how many games Luke put into each box.
He put 4 games into each box.

Step 3: Find out how many boxes Luke needed to meet the requirement of packing 18 games.
Since he can put 4 games in each box, he needs boxes equivalent to the division of 18 by 4. Mathematically, this is represented as: ⌊18 / 4⌋, where ⌊⌋ is the floor function (rounds down).
Calculating this, we get: ⌊18 / 4⌋ = <ins>4 boxes</ins>. However, since he can entirely fill 4 boxes with 18 games, he would need an additional box to ensure all the remaining games fit in.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many students were picked for the trivia teams. We know that 17 students didn't get picked, so the number of students who were picked is the total number of students who tried out (65) minus the number who weren't picked (17).

Mathematically, Number_of_students_picked = Total_students - Students_not_picked = 65 - 17 = 48.

Step 2: We are told that the rest of the students were put into 8 groups. So, to find the number of students in each group, we need to divide the total number of students remaining by the number of groups.

Mathematically, Students_in_one_group = Total_students_remaining / Number_of_groups.

We found out earlier that 48 students were picked for the trivia teams, so the total number of students remaining is 65 (total students who tried out) - 48 (students picked) = 17 students.

Now, we'll calculate the number of students in each group:

Students_in_one_group = 17 / 8 = 2.125. Since it's impossible to have a fraction of a student, we'll need to round up or down this number depending on the context (i.e., if we consider it ok to have groups with slightly different number of students or not).

If we decide to round down, then each group will have 2 students. If we decide to round up, then each group will have 3 students.

{The final answer depends on whether we want to accept groups having slightly different sizes. If the answer is 2, it represents the minimum number of students per group. If the answer is 3, it's the maximum number of students per group (with some groups having one student fewer than this number).}</s>",6

Step 4: We know that there are 25 total pictures, Isabel put 10 pictures in the first album, so that leaves us with 15 pictures that need to be distributed among the remaining 5 albums.

Step 5: To find out how many pictures are in each of the remaining 5 albums, we divide the number of remaining pictures by the number of albums: Number of pictures in one album = Total remaining pictures / Number of remaining albums = 15 pictures / 5 albums = 3 pictures.

Therefore, the final answer is that each of the remaining 5 albums contains 3 pictures. {The final answer is 3 pictures per album for the remaining 5 albums.}</s>",3

                     While on vacation, Gwen took 41 ? pictures : at ; the zoo and ! 29 at , the museum. ; If she ! later deleted 15 of the pictures, how many . pictures from her . vacation did , she still have? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many pictures Gwen took in total during her vacation. We know she took 41 pictures at the zoo and 29 pictures at the museum.

Total pictures = Pictures at the zoo + Pictures at the museum
Total pictures = 41 + 29
Total pictures = 70

Step 2: Next, we need to find out how many pictures she deleted later. According to the problem, she deleted 15 pictures.

Step 3: To find the number of pictures she still has after deleting some, we can subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures.

Pictures remaining = Total pictures - Deleted pictures
Pictures remaining = 70 - 15

Step 4: Let's do the calculation:

Pictures remaining = 55

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of puppies at the shelter after the new litter was brought in.
The pet shelter had 2 puppies initially, and 34 new puppies were brought in. So, the total number of puppies at the shelter is: 2 (initial puppies) + 34 (new puppies) = 36.

Step 2: Find out how many puppies get adopted each day.
It was mentioned that 4 puppies get adopted each day.

Step 3: Calculate how many days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted.
To find out how many days are needed, we can divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day: 36 (total puppies) / 4 (puppies adopted per day) = 9 days

{The final answer is: It would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.}</s>",9

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the Problem
: has 59 pieces of clothing in total. He put 32 in one load. He decided to split the rest into smaller loads, making 9 equal loads. We need to find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each small load.

Step 2: Find the Total Number of Pieces in the Remaining Loads
First, we need to find out how many pieces of clothing are in the remaining loads after : put 32 in one load.
Total clothing = 59
Clothes in one load = 32
Clothes in remaining loads = Total clothing - Clothes in one load
Clothes in remaining loads = 59 - 32
Clothes in remaining loads = 27

Step 3: Figure Out How Many Pieces Go in Each Small Load
: decided to split the clothes into 9 equal loads. We need to find out how many pieces go in each small load.
Number of clothes in each small load = Total clothes in remaining loads / Number of small loads
Number of clothes in each small load = 27 / 9

Step 4: Find the Answer
Now, let's calculate the number of pieces of clothing in each small load.
Number of clothes in each small load = 27 ÷ 9
Number of clothes in each small load ≈ 3

So, approximately 3 pieces of clothing could go into each small load.

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. Katie started with 85 files.
2. She deleted 40 files, leaving her with:
   Files remaining = Initial files - Deleted files
   = 85 - 40
   = 45 files
3. Katie put the remaining files into folders, with 5 files in each folder.
4. To find out how many folders she ended up with, we divide the number of remaining files by the number of files per folder:
   Folders = Remaining files / Files per folder
   = 45 / 5
   = 9 folders
 however, since there cannot be a fraction of a folder, Katie would have to make an extra folder to accommodate the remaining files. So the final answer is:

 {The final answer is: Katie ended up with 10 folders.}</s>",9

First, let's calculate how much he earned on each day:

1. On Monday, he worked for 8 hours at a rate of $8 per hour, so his earnings were $8 x 8 = $64.
2. On Tuesday, he worked for 2 hours at a rate of $8 per hour, so his earnings were $8 x 2 = $16.

Now, let's add up his earnings from both days to find his total earnings:

Total earnings = Earnings on Monday + Earnings on Tuesday
Total earnings = $64 + $16
Total earnings = $80

                 [/INST] Step 1: Carol made 19 cups of cupcakes.

Step 2: She sold 6 cups of cupcakes, so we need to find out how many cupcakes that represents. Each cup contains approximately 18 standard muffin-sized cupcakes (this can vary depending on the specific recipe and size). So, 1 cup = 18 cupcakes.

 step 3: Therefore, 6 cups = 6 x 18 = 108 cupcakes sold.

Step 4: After selling those cupcakes, Carol made 27 more cupcakes.

Step 5: So the total number of cupcakes Carol has now is the number she made initially plus the number she made after selling the first batch:
19 cups * 18 = 322 cupcakes (initial)
+ 27 cupcakes = 349 cupcakes (total)

Step 2: However, during the game, 7 members didn't show up. So the number of members who did show up was 14 (total members) - 7 (absent members) = 7 members.

Step 3: Each member who did show up scored 5 points. To find the total number of points scored, we can multiply the number of members who showed up by the number of points each member scored.

So, the total number of points scored is 7 members * 5 points/member = 35 points.

2. Two members didn't show up, so the number of members who did show up is 5 - 2 = 3.
3. Each member who showed up scored 6 points.
4. To find the total number of points scored, we multiply the number of members who showed up by the number of points each member scored:
   Total points = Number of members * Points per member
   Total points = 3 * 6
5. Calculating this multiplication, we get:
   Total points = 3 * 6
   Total points = 18

Given: There are a total of 46 books and the librarian takes 10, so there are 36 books left for Oliver.

Step 2: Calculate how many books Oliver can put on one shelf.

Given: Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf.

Step 3: Determine how many shelves Oliver needs to store all the remaining books.

Since Oliver has 36 books left and can fit 4 books on one shelf, we divide the total number of books by the number of books that can fit on one shelf.

Number of shelves = Total number of books / Books fit on one shelf

Step 3: Calculate the number of shelves Oliver needs.

Number of shelves = 36 books / 4 books/shelf
Number of shelves = 9.5 shelves

Since Oliver cannot have a half shelf, he will need to round up and get 10 shelves.

Step 4: Conclude that Oliver will need 10 shelves to put away the remaining books.

                 [/INST] Let's reason through this problem step by step:

1. We know that Luke had 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes.
2. Each pile of quarters or dimes had 3 coins in it.
3. To find the total number of coins Luke had, we need to find the number of coins in each type of pile and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of coins in each pile of quarters:
Number of coins in each pile of quarters = 5 (piles) * 3 (coins per pile) = 15 coins

Next, let's calculate the number of coins in each pile of dimes:
Number of coins in each pile of dimes = 5 (piles) * 3 (coins per pile) = 15 coins

Now, let's find the total number of coins Luke had by adding the number of coins in all his piles of quarters and piles of dimes:
Total number of coins = Number of coins in quarters piles + Number of coins in dimes piles
Total number of coins = 15 coins/pile (for quarters) * 5 piles (for quarters) + 15 coins/pile (for dimes) * 5 piles (for dimes)
Total number of coins = 75 coins

1. First, let's find the total number of pounds recycled by Gwen and her friends:
   Gwen recycled 5 pounds.
   Her friends recycled 13 pounds.
   Total pounds recycled = Gwen's pounds + Friends' pounds = 5 + 13 = <<5+13=8>>8 pounds.

2. Next, we need to find out how many points they earned for recycling this amount:
   They earned one point for every 3 pounds recycled.
   Points earned = Total pounds recycled / Pounds required for one point.
   Points earned = 8 / 3 = <<8/3=2.66666667>>2.67 (approximately). However, since they cannot earn a fraction of a point, they rounded down, which means they earned 2 points.

Haley bought tickets for herself and her friends, so we know she bought 3 tickets for this group. She also bought 5 extra tickets.
Total tickets bought = tickets for herself and friends + extra tickets = 3 + 5 = 8.

Step 2:Calculate the cost of tickets for herself and her friends.
Each ticket cost $4, so the cost for 3 tickets is:
3 tickets × $4/ticket = $12.

Step 3:Calculate the cost of the extra tickets.
The cost for 5 extra tickets is:
5 tickets × $4/ticket = $20.

Step 4:Calculate the total amount spent by Haley.
Total amount spent = amount spent on tickets for herself and friends + amount spent on extra tickets = $12 (for herself and friends) + $20 (for extra tickets) = $32.

                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many pictures Robin uploaded in total. We know she uploaded 31 pictures from her phone and 5 pictures from her camera, so:

Total pictures = Pictures from phone + Pictures from camera
= 31 + 5
= 36

Next, we need to find out how many pictures should be in each album if there are 9 albums with the same number of pictures in each. Since there are 36 pictures in total, we can divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find out how many pictures should be in each album:

Pictures in each album = Total pictures / Number of albums
= 36 / 9
= 4

However, we cannot have a fraction of a picture, so we need to find out how to distribute the remaining pictures evenly among the albums. Since there are 3 extra pictures (36 - 9 x 4 = 3), we can add one additional picture to 3 albums:

Albums with one extra picture = 3

Therefore, each album will contain 4 pictures, and 3 albums will contain an additional picture, making it a total of 5 pictures in those albums.

So, the final answer is that there are 5 pictures in each of the 3 albums with an extra picture. The remaining 6 albums will contain exactly 4 pictures each. {The final answer is: There are 5 pictures in each of 3 albums and 4 pictures in each of the remaining 6 albums.}</s>",4

                     Bianca was organizing her book , case ; making sure ! each of ; the shelves had exactly , 8 : books on it. If . she had ; 5 shelves of mystery books and ? 4 shelves , of picture books, how many ! books did she have total? ? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of books on each shelf for mystery and picture books separately.
- For mystery books: Since Bianca has 5 shelves and each shelf has exactly 8 books, the number of books for mystery books is: 5 shelves * 8 books/shelf = 40 books.
- For picture books: Since Bianca has 4 shelves and each shelf has exactly 8 books, the number of books for picture books is: 4 shelves * 8 books/shelf = 32 books.

Step 2: Add the number of books for mystery and picture books together to find the total number of books Bianca has.
Total number of books = Number of mystery books + Number of picture books = 40 books + 32 books = {72 books}.

So, the final answer is: {The total number of books Bianca has is 72}.</s>",72

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many cards can be put on each page in the binder. Since there are 3 slots on each page, we can put 3 cards in each slot. Therefore, each page can hold 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 cards.

Step 2: Calculate how many pages are needed for the new cards. John has 8 new cards, so he will need 8 / 9 = <<8/9=0.8888888888889>>>0.9 pages. Since you cannot have a fraction of a page in reality, John would need to use 1 additional page to accommodate these 0.9 pages worth of cards. In total, he would need 1 + 0.9 = <<1+0.9=1.9>>1.9 pages, but since a binder can only provide integer pages, John would need to round up and use 2 pages for his new cards.

Step 3: Determine how many pages are needed for the old cards. John has 16 old cards, so he will need 16 / 9 = <<16/9=1.777777777778>>1.8 pages. Again, John would need to round up and use 2 pages for his old cards as well.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of pages required in the binder for all the cards. John will need 2 pages for his new cards and 2 pages for his old cards, so the binder should have a minimum capacity of 2 + 2 = <<2+2=4>>4 pages.

The final answer is that John needs to use a binder with a minimum capacity of 4 pages to store all of his new and old baseball cards.</s>",8

                 [/INST] Step 1: Isabel baked 3 brownies, and she needs 5 for her party. So, she needs to bake an additional number of brownies to reach a total of 5.

Step 2: Since each brownie requires 5 cups of flour, the number of additional cups of flour Isabel needs is equal to the number of additional brownies she needs to bake multiplied by the amount of flour each brownie requires.

Additional brownies required = Total brownies needed - Brownies already baked
= 5 - 3
= 2 brownies

Cups of flour required = Additional brownies * Cups of flour per brownie
= 2 * 5
= 10 cups

Step 3: Thus, Isabel needs to obtain 10 more cups of flour to accommodate the 2 additional brownies for her party.

{The final answer is: Isabel needs 10 more cups of flour}.</s>",10

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find out how many cupcakes Maria made in total. We know that she made 19 cupcakes.

Step 2: Next, let's see how many cupcakes she sold. She sold 5 cupcakes.

Step 3: Therefore, the number of cupcakes Maria still has is the initial number of cupcakes she made minus the number of cupcakes she sold.

The initial number of cupcakes Maria made = 19
The number of cupcakes she sold = 5

So,
Number of cupcakes Maria still has = Initial number of cupcakes - Sold cupcakes
= 19 - 5
= 14

Step 4: After selling those cupcakes, Maria made 10 more. So, we need to add the number of new cupcakes she made to the number of cupcakes she still had after selling the first ones.

Number of new cupcakes = 10

So,
Total number of cupcakes Maria has = Initial number of cupcakes she had - Sold cupcakes + New cupcakes
= 14 + 10

Step 2: Five students left during the year. So, we need to subtract these students from the initial number.

31 students - 5 students = ↓ 26 students

Step 3: Eleven new students came to the school during the year. We need to add these students to the number of students remaining.

26 students + 11 students = ↑ 37 students

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find out Adam's total number of correct answers in the game. He answered correctly in the first half and in the second half.
Total number of correct answers = Correct answers in the first half + Correct answers in the second half
2. The problem states that Adam answered correctly in the first half and incorrectly in the second half, so we have to assume that there was a mistake in the problem statement. Instead, we'll assume that he answered correctly in the first half and in the second half (not specified in the problem).
3. Using this information, we can calculate Adam's total number of correct answers:
Total number of correct answers = 8 (correct answers in the first half) +2 (correct answers in the second half) = 10
4. Each correct answer is worth 8 points, so we can calculate Adam's final score by multiplying his total number of correct answers by the number of points per correct answer:
Final score = Total number of correct answers × Points per correct answer
Final score = 10 × 8 = 80

- Constants: Bianca recycled 24 pounds.
- Variables: Her friends recycled X pounds.
- Points earned based on pounds recycled: Y points for every 3 pounds.

Step 2: calculate the number of points Bianca earned.
Bianca earned points for recycling 24 pounds. Since 1 point is earned for every 3 pounds, we calculate that:
 points for Bianca = 24 pounds ÷ 3 pounds/point = 8 points

Step 3: calculate the number of points her friends earned.
her friends points = X pounds ÷ 3 pounds/point

Step 4: calculate the total number of points earned.
total points = points for Bianca + points for her friends = 8 points + X points

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of players on the team. We have 2 new players and 6 returning players. So the total number of players is 2 (new) + 6 (returning) = 8 players.

Step 2: Determine how many players should be in each group according to the coach's requirement. Each group will have 4 players.

Step 3: Determine how many groups can be formed with the given number of players. To find out the number of groups, divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group and round up to the nearest whole number (since there cannot be a fraction of a group). So the number of groups would be 8 (total players) / 4 (players per group) = 2 groups of 4 players each. However, since we cannot have a team with only 2 players, we will need at least one more group. In this case, we have an extra player (8th player), so we can form a third group.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it will take the painter to paint the remaining 4 rooms after he has already painted 2 rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. First, let's determine how long it takes for the painter to paint one room: 1 room = 5 hours

2. Next, let's find out how long it takes for the painter to paint 2 rooms: 2 rooms = 2 * 5 hours = 10 hours

3. The painter has already painted 2 rooms and it took him 10 hours. Now, he needs to paint an additional 4 rooms.

4. To find out how long it will take for the painter to paint the remaining 4 rooms, we can simply multiply the time it takes to paint one room (5 hours) by the number of remaining rooms (4).

5. Therefore, 4 rooms * 5 hours/room = 20 hours

6. The painter has already spent 10 hours painting 2 rooms. To find out how much longer it will take him to finish painting the remaining rooms, we subtract the time already spent from the total time needed.

7. Total time remaining = 20 hours (for 4 rooms) - 10 hours (already painted) = 10 hours

1. We know that there were 22 customers in total and 14 left, so there must have been 22 - 14 = 8 customers who remained.
2. Each table had 4 people, so the number of tables is equal to the number of customers divided by the number of people per table.

                 [/INST] Step 1: At the start of the year, there were 10 students in fourth grade.

Step 2: During the year, 4 students left the classroom, so the number of students decreased by 4.

Step 3: Next, 42 new students arrived in the classroom.

Step 4: To find out how many students were in the fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to add the number of students at the start of the year to the number of students who arrived late in the year.

Step 5: So, the calculation goes as follows:

Number of students at the end of the year = Number of students at the start of the year + Number of students who arrived during the year - Number of students who left during the year

Step 6: Plugging in the given numbers, we have:

Step 2: Therefore, Roger is left with 12 books (14 total books minus the 2 books taken by the librarian).

Step 3: We are told that Roger cannot fit 3 books on one shelf.

Step 4: To determine how many shelves Roger needs, we divide the total number of books he is left with by the number of books that can fit on one shelf.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of flowers Bianca picked in total.
Each time Bianca picked a type of flower, she picked a certain number. Let's find out how many flowers of each type she picked:
- Tulips: 39
- Roses: 49

The total number of flowers picked by Bianca is the sum of the number of tulips and the number of roses:
Total flowers = Tulips + Roses
= 39 + 49
= 88

Step 2: Determine how many flowers Bianca used to make flower bouquets.
The question states that Bianca used 81 flowers for making flower bouquets.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total number of flowers picked and the number of flowers used.
This difference represents the number of extra flowers Bianca picked.

Extra flowers = Total flowers - Used flowers
= 88 - 81
= 7

{The final answer is 7}. Thus, Bianca picked 7 extra flowers beyond the 81 flowers she used to make flower bouquets.</s>",7

                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Cody would need to fill up for his sodas, we first need to determine the total number of sodas he bought.

1. Cody bought 4 regular sodas.
2. He bought 44 diet sodas.
3. The total number of sodas is the sum of both types: 4 (regular) + 44 (diet) = 48 sodas.

Now, let's find out how many sodas can be placed on one shelf:

4. Each shelf can hold 6 sodas.

To find out how many shelves Cody would need, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can be held on one shelf, then round up to the nearest whole number because we can't have a fraction of a shelf:

5. Number of shelves = Total number of sodas / Sodas per shelf
5. Number of shelves = 48 / 6
5. Number of shelves = 8 (round up because we can't have a fraction of a shelf)

1. Find the total number of team members:
total team members = 26 boys + 46 girls = 72

2. To find out how many groups of 9 members each can be formed, we need to divide the total number of team members by the number of members in each group.

3. Calculate the number of groups:
groups = total team members / members per group
groups = 72 / 9
groups ≈ 8

Since there cannot be a fraction of a group, we consider forming 8 groups with the remaining team members as an additional small group.

1. The cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples, so the total number of apples is:
Total apples = 6 red apples + 15 green apples
Total apples = 6 + 15 = 21 apples

2. Each student received an apple or two (one red and one green), so 5 students received a total of:
Apples for 5 students = 2 apples/student * 5 students
Apples for 5 students = 10 apples

3. To find out how many apples were used to serve 5 students, we can subtract the number of apples given to the students from the total number of apples ordered:

                 [/INST] To find out how many people would be on each team if they split into 8 teams, we first need to determine the total number of people present at the picnic. According to the problem, there are 9 managers and 15 employees, so the total number of people is:

Total number of people = Managers + Employees
Total number of people = 9 + 15
Total number of people = 24

Now we can find out how many people would be on each team by dividing the total number of people by the number of teams:

Number of people per team = Total number of people / Number of teams
Number of people per team = 24 / 8

We can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (which is 4):

Number of people per team = 6 / 2
Number of people per team = 3

However, we made an error in simplifying the fraction incorrectly. The correct way is to divide both the numerator and denominator by 2:

Number of people per team = 24 / 8
Number of people per team = 3

So, the error was in my previous answer. In fact, there should be 3 people on each team.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how much money Mike had left after spending 10 dollars on new mower blades.

Mike made 42 dollars and spent 10 dollars on new mower blades. So, the amount of money Mike had left is:

42 dollars (Mike made) - 10 dollars (Money spent on mower blades) = 32 dollars

Step 2: Determine how many 8-dollar games Mike could buy with the 32 dollars he had left.

Mike had 32 dollars left and each game cost 8 dollars. To find out how many games he could buy, we divide the amount of money Mike had left by the cost of each game.

Number of games = Amount of money left / Cost of each game
Number of games = 32 dollars / 8 dollars/game

Step 3: Calculate the number of games.

Number of games = 4

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes the chef to cook the remaining 13 - 5 = <<13-5=8>>8 potatoes, we need to multiply the number of potatoes by the cooking time per potato.

Step 1: Number of potatoes to be cooked = 8
Step 2: Cooking time per potato = 6 minutes

Step 3: Total cooking time for 8 potatoes = (Number of potatoes) x (Cooking time per potato)
                                                 = 8 x 6

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We know that Paige had 43 math problems and 12 science problems for homework.
2. She finished 44 problems at school, but it's not clear whether these were all math problems or some were science problems.
3. To find out how many problems Paige had left to do for homework, we need to determine how many problems she had in total after finishing 44 at school, and then subtract the number of problems she had finished.

First, let's find the total number of problems Paige had after finishing 44 at school:

- Math problems: 43 (original number) + 44 (finished) = 87
- Science problems: 12 (original number)

So, Paige had 87 math problems and 12 science problems in total.

Then, to find out how many problems Paige had left to do, we subtract the number of problems she had finished from the total number of problems:

- Number of problems to do: 87 (total math problems) + 12 (total science problems) - 44 (problems finished)

{The final answer is 111 problems to do.}

It's important to note that the answer seems too high. Since we assumed all 44 problems finished were math problems, that would have accounted for only 43 math problems (since the original number was 43 + 1 = 44), leaving an extra problem unaccounted for. Therefore, it's likely that some of the 44 problems finished at school were science problems. To find the correct answer, you would need to know how many of the 44 problems finished were in each category.</s>",11

                 [/INST] To find out how many baggies Robin can make with the given number of cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per baggie. Let's calculate this step by step.

1. Chocolate chip cookies: Robin has 23 chocolate chip cookies.
2. Oatmeal cookies: Robin has 25 oatmeal cookies.
3. Cookies per baggie: Robin puts 6 cookies in each baggie.

First, let's calculate how many baggies Robin can make with the chocolate chip cookies:

`Chocolate chip baggies = Total Number of chocolate chip cookies / Cookies per baggie`
`= 23 / 6`

To divide by 6, we can either divide by 3 and multiply by 2 or use long division:

`23 ÷ 6 = 3 R 5`

Since she can't make a fraction of a baggie, she can make only 3 full baggies with chocolate chip cookies.

Next, let's calculate how many baggies Robin can make with the oatmeal cookies:

`Oatmeal baggies = Total Number of oatmeal cookies / Cookies per baggie`
`= 25 / 6`

Again, let's divide by 6:

`25 ÷ 6 = 4 R 1`

She can make 4 full baggies with oatmeal cookies and has enough for an additional baggie with 1 cookie left over.

So, the final answer is: {Robin can make a total of 7 baggies: 3 baggies with chocolate chip cookies and 4 baggies with oatmeal cookies.}</s>",8

1. First, let's find out how many pictures Wendy uploaded in total:
   * Wendy uploaded 22 pictures from her phone.
   * She uploaded 2 pictures from her camera.
   * Total number of pictures uploaded = 22 (from phone) + 2 (from camera) = 24 pictures.

2. Now we know that Wendy sorted her pictures into 4 different albums, so we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find out how many pictures are in each album:
   * Number of pictures in each album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums
   * Number of pictures in each album = 24 / 4 = 6 pictures.

{The final answer is: Each album contains 6 pictures.}</s>",6

                    question:
                     A pet store had 88 puppies. In one , day they ! sold 34 . of them ? and put ? the ? rest ! into . cages with 6 in each : cage. How many cages did they use? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many cages the pet store used, we first need to determine how many puppies they sold in one day and how many were left over.

Step 1: Find out how many puppies were sold.
The pet store sold 34 groups of puppies on that day. Since the number of puppies per group is not mentioned, we cannot find the exact number of puppies sold directly from the given information. However, we know that they had 88 puppies in total, so:

88 (total puppies) = 34 (puppies sold) + ? (puppies left)

To find the number of puppies left, we'll need to learn how many puppies are in each cage since the remaining puppies are put into cages.

Step 2: Find out how many puppies are in each cage.
The problem states that the rest of the puppies were put into cages with 6 puppies in each cage. Therefore, the number of remaining puppies can be calculated by finding how many puppies are in the last cage.

Since there is 1 less cage with 6 puppies each than the total number of cages used, the total number of puppies can be represented in multiples of 6 (6, 12, 18, ...). As there were 88 puppies in total and 34 were sold, the number of puppies in the last cage is:

Number of puppies in the last cage = Total number of puppies - Number of puppies sold
Number of puppies in the last cage = 88 - 34 = 54

Since there are 6 puppies in each cage, only 9 full cages are possible:

9 full cages * 6 = 54

However, since there are 54 puppies in the last cage and there will be one empty cage (since there will be no puppies in the last cage), there will be ten cages in total:

Number of cages = Full cages + 1 (empty cage)
Number of cages = 9 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the pet store used 10 cages, considering that the last cage was empty. However, the final answer is:

{The final answer is 11 cages (10 full cages with 6 puppies each and 1 empty cage)}.

It appeared that the problem suggested there were 11 cages at the end, but after careful analysis and solving the problem, it revealed that the problem was not clear about the last cage. As a result, the final answer should be 10 cages. However, the initial confusion may cause some to assume they found 11 cages. It's always a good idea to double-check and ensure the answer makes sense given the information provided. In this case, 11 cages is not valid because there are only 6*10 = 60 puppies that fit into 10 cages, while the original problem said there were 88 puppies.</s>",9

                     , Jerry : was helping , the cafeteria . workers pick up : lunch trays, ; but he could : only carry 8 trays at a time. ? If he had : to pick up 9 trays from one ? table and 7 trays from , another, how many trips will he ! make? ? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many trips Jerry needs to make to pick up the given number of trays, let's calculate it step by step:

1. Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time.
2. He needs to pick up 9 trays from the first table and 7 trays from the second table.

First, let's see how many trays he can pick up from one table in one trip: `8 trays`

Since Jerry can pick up 8 trays at a time from one table, he needs to make:

`Number of trips for first table = Total trays at first table / Trays carried per trip`
`= 9 trays / 8 trays per trip`

The result is a quotient and a remainder, which means he needs to make one full trip carrying 8 trays and one trip to pick up the remaining tray:
`1 full trip (8 trays) + 1 trip (1 tray) = 2 trips`

Now, let's calculate how many trips he needs to make to pick up all the trays from both tables:

`Total trips = Trips for first table + Trips for second table`

Since Jerry made `2 trips` to pick up all the trays from the first table and he needs to pick up `7 trays` from the second table:
`Trips for second table = Total trays at second table / Trays carried per trip`
`= 7 trays / 8 trays per trip`

The result is also a quotient and a remainder, which means he needs to make one full trip carrying 8 trays and an additional trip to pick up the remaining trays:
`1 full trip (8 trays) + 1 trip (1 tray) = 2 trips`

Finally, to find the total number of trips Jerry has to make, we sum up the number of trips for each table:

`Total trips = 2 trips (for first table) + 2 trips (for second table)`

The final answer is: Jerry needs to make `4 trips` in total to pick up all the trays from both tables.</s>",2

- Faye is playing a video game and earns 7 points for each treasure she finds.
- She found 2 treasures on the first level.
- She found 6 treasures on the second level.

Step 2:Calculate the number of points earned from each level
- Points earned on the first level = Treasures found * Points per treasure
= 2 * 7
= 14 points

- Points earned on the second level = Treasures found * Points per treasure
= 6 * 7
= 42 points

Step 2: She then threw out 4 of these carrots, so the number of carrots she was left with was:
19 (initial pick) - 4 (Discarded) = 15 carrots

Step 3: The next day, Megan picked 46 more carrots from her garden.

Step 4: Therefore, the total number of carrots Megan had after her two picking sessions would be:

                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many files Wendy had left after deleting 37 of them.

Wendy had 82 files in total, and she deleted 37 files. Therefore, the number of files Wendy kept is:

82 files (total) − 37 files (deleted) = 45 files

Next, we need to determine how many files each folder can contain. Wendy put the rest of her files into folders with 5 files in each one. So, each folder can hold:

5 files

Since we know the number of files Wendy kept and the number of files per folder, we can calculate how many folders she ended up with.

To find the number of folders, divide the number of files Wendy kept by the number of files per folder, and round up to the nearest integer (since Wendy can't have a fraction of a folder).

Number of folders = (Number of files Wendy kept) / (Number of files per folder)
Number of folders = 45 files / 5 files/folder = 9 folders

However, since Wendy can't have a fraction of a folder, she would need one more folder to accommodate the remaining files. Therefore, she ended up with:

Number of folders = 9 folders + 1 folder = 10 folders

The final answer is: Wendy ended up with 10 folders.</s>",9

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups the coach can form with the given number of new and returning players, we first need to determine the total number of players.

Total players = New players + Returning players
= 12 + 44
= 56

Next, divide the total number of players by the number of players per group to find out how many groups can be formed.

Number of groups = Total players / Players per group
= 56 / 8

Now, we calculate the quotient and remainder of the division using long division or a calculator to find the exact count of groups:

56 ÷ 8 = 7 with a remainder of 0

So, the exact number of groups is 7 because there is no remainder, and the groups are all full (contain 8 players).

Will earned $104 over the summer.
He spent $41 on new mower blades.

Subtract the amount spent on mower blades from the total earning to find out how much money Will had left:
$104 (total earnings) - $41 (spent on mower blades) = $63

Step 2: Determine how many 9-dollar games Will could buy with the remaining money.
Divide the remaining amount of money by the cost of each game:
$63 ÷ $9 = 7

First, let's find out how many worksheets she has left to grade:

Total worksheets = 16
Worksheets graded = 8

Worksheets to be graded = Total worksheets -Worksheets graded

Finally, to find out how many cages are needed to house the remaining puppies, we divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage.

4. Number of cages = Number of remaining puppies / Number of puppies per cage
= <ins>6</ins> / 2

                    question:
                    .  Faye and her , mom ! were picking carrots from , their ? garden. Faye picked ! 23 and her ; mother picked : 5. If only 12 of ? the carrots were good, how many ! bad carrots did they have? 
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many carrots Faye and her mother picked in total. We know that Faye picked 23 carrots and her mother picked 5 carrots. Therefore, the total number of carrots picked is: 23 (by Faye) + 5 (by her mother) = <\b>28<\\b> carrots.

2. Next, we're told that only 12 carrots were good. To find out how many bad carrots there were, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked. So, the number of bad carrots is: 28 (total carrots) - 12 (good carrots) = <\b>16<\\b> bad carrots.

                    question:
                     Isabel picked 66 flowers for her : friend’s ! wedding. She ? was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. ; If 10 of the flowers wilted before the ; wedding, how . many ? bouquets : could she still ; make? ; 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of bouquets Isabel could make with the initial number of flowers.
We know that Isabel made bouquets with 8 flowers each. So, the number of bouquets she made is:

Number of bouquets = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per bouquet

Step 1 calculation:
Number of bouquets = 66 flowers / 8 flowers per bouquet
Number of bouquets = 8.25

Since she can't make a fraction of a bouquet, let's round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of bouquets = 8

Step 2: Determine the number of bouquets Isabel could make after the wilted flowers were removed.
We know that 10 flowers wilted before the wedding. So Isabel had:

Initial number of flowers = 66 flowers
Number of wilted flowers = 10 flowers

Number of remaining flowers = Initial number of flowers - Number of wilted flowers

Step 2 calculation:
Number of remaining flowers = 66 flowers - 10 flowers
Number of remaining flowers = 56 flowers

Step 3: Calculate the number of bouquets Isabel could make with the remaining flowers.

Number of remaining bouquets = Number of remaining flowers / Number of flowers per bouquet

Step 3 calculation:
Number of remaining bouquets = 56 flowers / 8 flowers per bouquet
Number of remaining bouquets = 7.06

Since she can't make a fraction of a bouquet, let's round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of remaining bouquets = 7

Step 4: Determine the final answer.

Isabel initially made 8 bouquets with the 66 flowers. After 10 of the flowers wilted, she had 56 flowers left and made 7 bouquets with them.

{The final answer is: Isabel could make a total of 15 bouquets for her friend's wedding. (8 original bouquets + 7 bouquets made from the remaining flowers) }</s>",7

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We are given that Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times.
2. We are also given that he rode the bumper cars 4 times.
3. Each ride on the ferris wheel costs 7 tickets.
4. Each ride on the bumper cars also costs 7 tickets.
5. To find out how many tickets Oliver used in total, we need to find out how many tickets he used for each ride type, and then add them together.
6. Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times, so the number of tickets he used for the ferris wheel is 5 * 7 = 35.
7. Oliver rode the bumper cars 4 times, so the number of tickets he used for the bumper cars is 4 * 7 = 28.
8. To find the total number of tickets Oliver used, we add the number of tickets for each ride type: 35 + 28 = 63.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many pieces of furniture Wendy bought in total.
Since Wendy bought 4 new chairs and 4 new tables, she bought a total of 4 + 4 = 8 pieces of furniture.

Step 2: Calculate how many minutes it took Wendy to put together one piece of furniture.
The problem states that Wendy spent 6 minutes on each piece of furniture.

Step 3: Calculate how many minutes it took Wendy to put together all the furniture.
To find the total number of minutes it took Wendy to put together all the furniture, we can multiply the number of pieces by the number of minutes it took to put together one piece.
Minutes to put together all furniture = Number of pieces * Minutes per piece
= 8 * 6
= 48 minutes

Ned bought 50 games from a friend. He bought 27 more games at a garage sale. So, Ned bought 50 + 27 = <<50+27=77>>77 games in total.

Step 2: Determine how many games didn't work.
74 of the games didn't work.

Step 3: Determine how many games worked.
If 74 of the games didn't work, then the number of games that worked is the total number of games he bought minus the number of games that didn't work: 77 - 74 = <<77-74=3>>3.
