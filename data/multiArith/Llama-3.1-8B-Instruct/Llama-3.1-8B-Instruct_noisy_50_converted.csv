                    question:
                   .  Paige had 11 : songs! on her mp3 player. If she deleted ; 9 old ; songs from it and then? added? 8 new songs, ; how many songs does she have ; on her mp3 player?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Paige initially has 11 songs on her mp3 player.

2. She deletes 9 old songs from her mp3 player. To find out how many songs she has left after deleting 9 songs, we subtract 9 from 11:
   11 - 9 = 2

   So, after deleting 9 songs, Paige has 2 songs left on her mp3 player.

3. Then, Paige adds 8 new songs to her mp3 player. To find out how many songs she has in total after adding 8 new songs, we add 8 to the 2 songs she already has:
   2 + 8 = 10

   So, after adding 8 new songs, Paige has 10 songs on her mp3 player.

The final answer is 10.<|eot_id|>",10,10.0,10.0

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: We know there are two groups of students trying out for the basketball team: girls and boys.

Step 2: We are given the number of girls (39) and boys (4) trying out for the team, but we don't know the total number of students. We need to find the total number of students.

Step 3: To find the total number of students, we add the number of girls and boys together: 39 (girls) + 4 (boys) = 43.

Step 4: We are told that only 26 students got called back, which means 43 - 26 = 17 students did not make the cut.

Therefore, the number of students who didn't make the cut is 17.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The school cafeteria initially had 23 apples.

Step 2: They used 20 apples to make lunch for the students. This means they subtract 20 from the initial number of apples.

23 (initial apples) - 20 (apples used) = 3

Step 3: After using 20 apples, they bought 6 more apples. This means we add 6 to the result from step 2.

3 (apples left after using 20) + 6 (apples bought) = 9

Step 4: Now we know the total number of apples they would have after using 20 and buying 6 more.

To find the total points earned, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of enemies defeated.
We are given that a level has 11 enemies total and you destroy all but 3 of them. This means you defeated 11 - 3 = 8 enemies.

Step 2: Calculate the points earned per enemy defeated.
Each enemy defeated gives you 9 points.

Step 3: Multiply the number of enemies defeated by the points earned per enemy to find the total points earned.
Total points earned = Number of enemies defeated * Points earned per enemy
Total points earned = 8 * 9

Step 4: Perform the multiplication.
8 * 9 = 72

Therefore, the total points earned would be 72.

Megan had 14 bags, but she didn't recycle 5 of them. So, the number of bags she recycled is:
14 (total bags) - 5 (bags not recycled) = 9 bags

Step 2: Calculate the number of points Megan earned from each bag she recycled.
Megan earned 8 points for each bag she recycled.

Step 3: Multiply the number of bags Megan recycled by the number of points she earned from each bag.
To find the total number of points Megan earned, we multiply the number of bags she recycled (9) by the number of points she earned from each bag (8):
9 (bags recycled) * 8 (points per bag) = 72 points

Therefore, Megan would have earned 72 points.

To find out how much money April earned, we need to determine how many roses she sold. We can do this by subtracting the number of roses she had left from the number she started with.

Step 1: Calculate the number of roses April sold.
Number of roses she started with: 13
Number of roses she had left: 4
Number of roses she sold = Number of roses she started with - Number of roses she had left
= 13 - 4
= 9

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money April earned from selling the roses.
Price of each rose: $4
Number of roses she sold: 9
Total amount of money earned = Price of each rose * Number of roses she sold

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many shirts Ned did not wash. 

Step 1: Identify the total number of shirts Ned had to wash.
The problem states that Ned had 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts. To find the total number of shirts, we add these two numbers together.
Total shirts = 9 + 21 = 30

Step 2: Identify the number of shirts Ned washed before school started.
The problem states that Ned washed 29 shirts by the time school started.

Step 3: Find out how many shirts Ned did not wash.
To find out how many shirts Ned did not wash, we subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts.
Shirts not washed = Total shirts - Shirts washed
= 30 - 29

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who actually showed up.
The company invited 47 people, but 7 of them didn't show up. So, the number of people who showed up is:
47 (invited) - 7 (didn't show up) = 40 people

Step 2: Determine the number of tables needed.
Each table holds 5 people. To find out how many tables are needed, we need to divide the total number of people who showed up by the number of people each table can hold:
40 (people) ÷ 5 (people per table) = 8

Since we can't have a fraction of a table, and we're asked how many tables they need, we round up if necessary. However, in this case, we can use the exact number of tables without rounding up or down.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the number of books Tom had initially.
Tom had 5 books.

Step 2: Calculate the number of books Tom sold.
He sold 4/5 of his books, which means he sold 4/5 * 5 = 4 books.

Step 3: Calculate the number of books Tom had left after selling 4 books.
Tom had 5 - 4 = 1 book left.

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Tom earned from selling the books.
Since the price of each book is not given, we assume the price of each book is the same. Let's call it 'x'. The total amount of money Tom earned is 4 * x.

Step 5: Calculate the number of new books Tom bought with the money he earned.
Tom bought 38 new books with the money he earned.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of books Tom has now.
The total number of books Tom has now is the sum of the books he had left and the new books he bought, which is 1 + 38 = 39.

However, the problem doesn't provide the price of each book or the amount of money Tom earned. To find the final answer, we need more information. But if we assume that the price of each book is the same and the amount of money Tom earned is used to buy 38 new books, the final answer would be the total number of books Tom has now.

To find out how many shelves Jerry would fill up, we need to calculate the total number of sodas he bought and then divide that by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sodas Jerry bought.
- Regular sodas: 41
- Diet sodas: 22
Total sodas = 41 + 22 = 63

Step 2: Determine the number of sodas each shelf can hold.
Each shelf can hold 9 sodas.

Step 3: Divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.
Number of shelves filled = Total sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
= 63 / 9
= 7

Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, and the question seems to be asking for the number of shelves filled, not the number of shelves needed, we will round down to the nearest whole number if necessary.

In this case, 7 is a whole number, so we don't need to round down.

Step 2: Determine how many pieces they ate on the first night.
They ate 35 pieces on the first night.

Step 3: Calculate how many pieces they have left.

To find out how many small gardens Emily had, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of seeds planted in the big garden.
We know that 29 seeds out of 41 were planted in the big garden. However, we are also given that some seeds were planted in the small gardens. We need to find the seeds planted in the small gardens first.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of seeds planted in the small gardens.
Since the problem mentions that the remaining seeds (after planting in the big garden) were divided among the small gardens, we can first find the remaining seeds. 
Let's assume x seeds were planted in the small gardens.
We know that 29 seeds were planted in the big garden, and the remaining seeds were planted in the small gardens. 
So, the total seeds planted in the small gardens would be 41 - 29 = 12 seeds.

Step 3: Calculate the number of small gardens.
We know that 4 seeds were planted in each small garden, and a total of 12 seeds were planted in the small gardens.
So, the number of small gardens can be calculated as follows:
Number of small gardens = Total seeds planted in small gardens / Seeds planted in each small garden

To find out how long the candy will last Emily, we need to calculate the total number of pieces she has and then divide that by the number of pieces she eats per day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces Emily received.
- She received 5 pieces from her neighbors.
- She received 13 pieces from her older sister.
Total pieces = 5 + 13 = 18

Step 2: Calculate how many pieces Emily has left after eating 9 pieces per day.
- Since we don't know how many days the candy will last, let's use the variable 'x' to represent the number of days.
- Emily eats 9 pieces per day, so in 'x' days, she will eat 9x pieces.
- To find out how many pieces she has left after 'x' days, we subtract the number of pieces she ate from the total number of pieces: 18 - 9x

Step 3: Since we want to find out how many days the candy will last, we need to find the value of 'x' when Emily has no pieces left.
- We set up the equation: 18 - 9x = 0
- To solve for 'x', we add 9x to both sides of the equation: 18 = 9x
- Then, we divide both sides by 9: 18/9 = x
- Simplifying the fraction: 2 = x

So, the candy will last Emily 2 days.

If he can fit ; 9. books, on a shelf, how : many shelves will, he need?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we will break it down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the total number of books that Mike has to put away.
There are 82 books in total.

Step 2: Calculate the number of books that the librarian takes.
The librarian takes 10% of the books. 
10% of 82 = (10/100) * 82 = 0.1 * 82 = 8.2

Step 3: Calculate the number of books that Mike is left with.
Mike is left with the total number of books minus the number of books taken by the librarian.
Books left with Mike = Total books - Books taken by the librarian
= 82 - 8.2
= 73.8

Step 4: Since we cannot have a fraction of a book, we will round down the number of books to the nearest whole number.
73.8 ≈ 73

Step 5: Calculate the number of shelves Mike will need.
Each shelf can fit 9 books. To find the number of shelves needed, we will divide the number of books by the number of books that can fit on a shelf.
Number of shelves = Number of books / Number of books per shelf
= 73 / 9
≈ 8.11

Step 6: Since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, we will round up the number of shelves to the nearest whole number.

However, since we're looking for the number of shelves that Mike will need, and he can't use a fraction of a shelf, we must round up the number of shelves. But we must also consider that he has 73 books and can put 9 books on each shelf.  8 shelves would be 8*9 = 72 books.  Mike would need 9 shelves to hold 73 books because 8 shelves would be 72 books and he has 73 books.<|eot_id|>",8,8.0,73.0

To find out how many pictures Nancy still has, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out the total number of pictures Nancy took. She took 49 pictures at the zoo and 8 at the museum.

   Total pictures taken = Pictures at the zoo + Pictures at the museum
   Total pictures taken = 49 + 8
   Total pictures taken = 57

2. Next, we need to subtract the number of pictures Nancy deleted from the total number of pictures she took.

   Pictures still having = Total pictures taken - Pictures deleted
   Pictures still having = 57 - 38

3. Now, let's calculate the result of the subtraction.

   Pictures still having = 19

To solve this problem, we'll go through it step by step.

Step 1: The store initially had 40 oranges in the bin.

Step 2: They threw away 25 of the old oranges. To find out how many oranges are left, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges.
40 (initial oranges) - 25 (oranges thrown away) = 15

Step 3: The store then put 21 new oranges in the bin. To find the total number of oranges in the bin now, we need to add the new oranges to the remaining oranges after throwing away the old ones.
15 (remaining oranges) + 21 (new oranges) = 36

Therefore, after throwing away 25 old oranges and adding 21 new ones, there would be 36 oranges in the bin.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The waiter had 7 customers at lunch.
2. We are given that some of the customers didn't leave a tip, but we don't know the exact number. However, we are given a ratio:? 5 : of them didn't leave a tip. This means that the number of customers who didn't leave a tip is a fraction of the total number of customers (7).

Since the ratio is? 5 :, this implies that the number of customers who didn't leave a tip is 5/7 of the total number of customers.

3. To find the number of customers who didn't leave a tip, we multiply the total number of customers (7) by the fraction 5/7:
   Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 7 * (5/7) = 5

However, this means that the number of customers who didn't leave a tip is 5, which is a whole number. This implies that the ratio? 5 : is actually a whole number ratio, not a fraction. In this case, the ratio? 5 : implies that 5 customers didn't leave a tip, and the remaining customers did leave a tip.

4. Since there are 7 customers in total, and 5 customers didn't leave a tip, the number of customers who did leave a tip is:
   Number of customers who did leave a tip = 7 - 5 = 2

5. We are given that the waiter got $3 each from the ones who did tip. To find the total amount of money the waiter earned from the customers who did leave a tip, we multiply the number of customers who did leave a tip (2) by the amount of money each customer gave ($3):
   Total amount of money earned from customers who did leave a tip = 2 * $3 = $6

6. Since the customers who didn't leave a tip didn't give the waiter any money, the total amount of money the waiter earned from all customers is equal to the amount of money earned from the customers who did leave a tip:
   Total amount of money earned = $6

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Faye initially scored 47 pieces of candy.
2. She ate 25 pieces of candy on the first night. To find out how many pieces she has left, we subtract the number of pieces she ate from the initial number of pieces:
   47 (initial pieces) - 25 (pieces eaten) = 22
3. After eating 25 pieces, Faye has 22 pieces left.
4. Her sister gave her 40 more pieces. To find out the total number of pieces Faye has now, we add the number of pieces her sister gave her to the number of pieces she had left:
   22 (pieces left) + 40 (pieces given by sister) = 62

So, Faye has 62 pieces of candy now {The final answer is 62}.<|eot_id|>",62,62.0,62.0

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chicken wings are available in total and then divide that number by the number of people in the group.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of chicken wings available.
The chef already had 9 chicken wings cooked, and then cooked 7 more for the group. So, the total number of chicken wings available is:
9 (initial wings) + 7 (additional wings) = 16

Step 2: Determine the number of people in the group.
The problem states that the group consists of 4 friends.

Step 3: Divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of people in the group to find out how many each person would get.
16 (total wings) ÷ 4 (number of people) = 4

Therefore, each person would get 4 chicken wings.

Total puppies = 40

Step 3: Determine the number of puppies adopted each day.
8 puppies are adopted each day.

Step 4: Calculate the number of days it would take to adopt all the puppies.
To find the number of days, we need to divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted each day.

Step 2: Determine the number of windows already installed.
The builder had already installed 6 windows.

Step 3: Calculate the number of windows left to install.
To find the number of windows left to install, we need to subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed.
9 (total windows needed) - 6 (windows already installed) = 3

Step 4: Determine the time it takes to install each window.
The problem states that it takes 6 hours to install each window.

Step 5: Calculate the time it will take to install the rest of the windows.
To find the time it will take to install the rest of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows left to install by the time it takes to install each window.
3 (windows left to install) * 6 (hours per window) = 18

Step 6: Determine the total time it will take to install all the windows.
Since the builder had already installed 6 windows, we need to add the time it will take to install the rest of the windows to the time it has already taken.
6 (hours already taken) + 18 (hours to install the rest) = 24

However, since the question only asks for the time it will take to install the rest of the windows, we can disregard the time already taken and focus on the time it will take to install the rest of the windows.

                    question:
                    ! A toy store had 17 giant stuffed bears in stock when : they : got another shipment? with 10 : bears in it. The put the. bears onto shelves with 9 on each. shelf.? How many shelves ; did they use?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we will follow the steps below:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of bears after the shipment arrives.
- The store initially had 17 bears.
- They received a shipment with 10 bears.
- Total bears = 17 (initial bears) + 10 (new bears) = 27 bears.

Step 2: Determine the number of bears on each shelf.
- The store puts the bears onto shelves with 9 bears on each shelf.

Step 3: Calculate the number of shelves used.
- To find the number of shelves used, we need to divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf.
- Number of shelves = Total bears / Bears per shelf
- Number of shelves = 27 / 9

Step 4: Perform the division.
- 27 / 9 = 3

Since we are dealing with physical shelves, we cannot have a fraction of a shelf. Therefore, if there are any remaining bears, they would be placed on additional shelves. In this case, we need to check if there are any remaining bears.

Step 5: Check for any remaining bears.
- Total bears = 27
- Bears per shelf = 9
- Since 27 is not exactly divisible by 9, we can check if there are any remaining bears by multiplying the number of shelves by the bears per shelf and comparing it to the total number of bears.
- 3 shelves * 9 bears/shelf = 27 bears
- Since 27 bears is equal to the total number of bears, there are no remaining bears. The store used exactly 3 shelves.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of shelves for each type of book.
- Gwen has 5 shelves of mystery books.
- Gwen has 3 shelves of picture books.

Step 2: Determine the total number of shelves.
- Total shelves = shelves of mystery books + shelves of picture books
- Total shelves = 5 + 3
- Total shelves = 8

Step 3: Calculate the total number of books on all shelves.
- Since each shelf has exactly 4 books on it, we can multiply the total number of shelves by the number of books on each shelf.
- Total books = total shelves * books on each shelf
- Total books = 8 * 4
- Total books = 32

Therefore, Gwen had a total of 32 books on her bookcase.

To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to first find the number of pictures that were put into the different albums. We can do this by subtracting the number of pictures put into the one album from the total number of pictures.

Step 1: Find the number of pictures that were put into the different albums.
Total pictures = 79
Pictures put into one album = 44
Pictures put into different albums = Total pictures - Pictures put into one album
= 79 - 44
= 35

Now that we know 35 pictures were put into the different albums, we can find the number of pictures in each album by dividing the total number of pictures in the different albums by the number of albums.

Step 2: Find the number of pictures in each album.
Pictures put into different albums = 35
Number of albums = 5
Pictures in each album = Pictures put into different albums / Number of albums
= 35 / 5
= 7

Therefore, there were 7 pictures in each album.

To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of students.
The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls.
Total students = 5 boys + 40 girls = 45 students

Step 2: Divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group.
The number of students in each group is given as 9.
Number of groups = Total students / Number of students in each group
= 45 / 9

Step 3: Calculate the result of the division.
45 / 9 = 5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we can make 5 groups with 9 students in each group and have 0 students left over.

To find out how much money April earned, we need to follow these steps:

April started with 9 roses and had 4 roses left. To find out how many roses she sold, we need to subtract the number of roses left from the total number of roses she started with.

Number of roses sold = Total number of roses - Number of roses left
= 9 - 4
= 5

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money April earned.
Since each rose was $7 and April sold 5 roses, we can multiply the number of roses sold by the price of each rose to find the total amount of money she earned.

Total amount of money earned = Number of roses sold * Price of each rose
= 5 * $7
= $35

Therefore, April earned $35.

The total number of members in the trivia team is 11.

Step 2: Determine the number of members who didn't show up during the game.
6 members didn't show up.

Step 3: Calculate the number of members who did show up during the game.
To find the number of members who did show up, we'll subtract the number of members who didn't show up from the total number of members.
11 (total members) - 6 (members who didn't show up) = 5

Step 4: Determine the number of points scored by each member who showed up.
Each member who showed up scored 9 points.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of points scored by the members who showed up.
To find the total number of points scored, we'll multiply the number of members who showed up by the number of points scored by each member.
5 (members who showed up) * 9 (points scored by each member) = 45

The store initially had 13 Siamese cats and 5 house cats. To find the total number of cats, we will add these two numbers together.

13 (Siamese cats) + 5 (house cats) = 18 cats

Step 2: Identify the number of cats sold during the sale.
The store sold 10 cats.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cats left after the sale.
To find the number of cats left, we will subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of cats.

Initial number of cats: 18
Number of cats sold: 10
Number of cats left = Initial number of cats - Number of cats sold
= 18 - 10

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Victor works as a sacker at a grocery store where he makes $6 an hour.

2. We need to find out how much he made in two days, specifically Monday and Tuesday.

3. On Monday, he worked 5 hours. 
   Since he makes $6 an hour, we can find out how much he made on Monday by multiplying the number of hours he worked by his hourly wage:
   5 hours * $6/hour = $30

4. On Tuesday, he also worked 5 hours.
   We can use the same calculation as in step 3 to find out how much he made on Tuesday:
   5 hours * $6/hour = $30

5. Now, we need to find out how much he made in total over the two days by adding the amount he made on Monday and Tuesday:
   $30 (Monday) + $30 (Tuesday) = $60

Therefore, Victor made $60 in those two days.

Step 2: Determine how many packages Megan can make with 28 cupcakes.
Each package contains 7 cupcakes. 
To find out how many packages Megan can make, we need to divide the number of cupcakes left by the number of cupcakes per package.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

**Step 1:** Understand the initial situation.
Adam has 48 books.

**Step 2:** Determine the number of books Adam sold.
Adam sold 19/10 of his books. However, the fraction 19/10 is not a whole number, which means the problem statement contains an error. We can assume the fraction is actually 19/20 or 19/10 can be interpreted as 19 out of some unknown total, but based on the context, we will assume the fraction is 19/20.

If we assume the fraction is 19/20, then Adam sold 19/20 * 48 = 38.4 books. However, since you can't sell a fraction of a book, we will interpret this as Adam selling 38 books out of 48, which is 19/20 of the books, or Adam selling 19/20 of the books, which is 38 books out of 48 is not correct. So the correct interpretation is 19/20 of the books. 

**Step 3:** Calculate the number of books Adam has left after selling 19/20 of them.
If Adam sold 19/20 of his books, then he has 1/20 of his books left. 
1/20 of 48 is 2.4. However, since you can't have a fraction of a book, we will interpret this as Adam having 2 books left.

**Step 4:** Calculate the amount of money Adam earned from selling the books.
Since we don't know the price of each book, we will assume the price is the same for all books. Let's denote the price of each book as P.

The total amount of money Adam earned is the number of books he sold multiplied by the price of each book. Since he sold 38 books, the total amount of money he earned is 38P.

**Step 5:** Calculate the number of new books Adam can buy with the money he earned.
The problem states that Adam used the money he earned to buy 38 new books. 

However, the question asks how many books Adam would have if he sold 19/20 of them and bought 38 new ones. Based on the previous steps, we know that Adam has 2 books left after selling 19/20 of them.

Since Adam bought 38 new books, the total number of books he has is 2 (books left after selling) + 38 (new books bought) = 40 books.

However, there is still an issue with the problem statement. The question is ambiguous and contains errors. But if we follow the steps and assume the problem statement is correct, the final answer would be 40.<|eot_id|>",67,67.0,40.0

There are 12 students and 3 adults going on the field trip. 
Total number of people = 12 students + 3 adults = 15 people

Step 2: Determine the number of vans needed.
Each van can hold 5 people. 
To find the number of vans needed, divide the total number of people by the number of people each van can hold.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of sodas Tom bought and then divide that number by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sodas Tom bought.
Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas.
Total number of sodas = 4 (regular) + 52 (diet) = 56 sodas.

Step 2: Determine the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.
The fridge can hold 7 sodas on each shelf.

Step 3: Divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf to find out how many shelves will be filled.
Number of shelves filled = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
= 56 / 7
= 8

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf and we are counting the number of shelves filled, we need to round up if there are any remaining sodas after filling the shelves.

Step 4: Check if there are any remaining sodas after filling the shelves.
Since 8 shelves * 7 sodas/shelf = 56 sodas, and we have 56 sodas, all shelves are filled.

Therefore, Tom would fill up 8 shelves {The final answer is}.<|eot_id|>",8,8.0,8.0

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

Step 1: The school cafeteria initially had 38 apples.

Step 2: They used 20 apples to make lunch for the students. So, we need to subtract 20 from 38 to find out how many apples are left.

38 - 20 = 18

Step 3: After using 20 apples, they bought 28 more. So, we need to add 28 to the remaining apples.

18 + 28 = 46

Therefore, the school cafeteria would have 46 apples.

                    question:
                     Luke was helping the cafeteria workers pick! up lunch trays, but. he could only ; carry 4 : trays at a ; time., If he had to pick up 20 trays from! one, table ; and 16 trays ; from another, how many : trips will he make?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trips Luke will make to pick up all the trays. 

Step 1: Calculate the total number of trays Luke needs to pick up.
- From one table: 20 trays
- From another table: 16 trays
Total number of trays = 20 + 16 = 36 trays

Step 2: Determine the number of trays Luke can carry in one trip.
- Luke can carry 4 trays at a time.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of trips Luke will make to pick up all the trays.
- To find this out, we need to divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Luke can carry in one trip.
- Number of trips = Total number of trays / Number of trays per trip
- Number of trips = 36 / 4

Step 4: Perform the division to find the number of trips.
- 36 / 4 = 9

However, since Luke can only carry 4 trays at a time, we need to consider that he might not be able to make a whole trip with the remaining trays if there are less than 4 trays left. 

Step 5: Check if there are any remaining trays that are less than 4.
- Total number of trays = 36
- Number of trips = 9
- Remaining trays = Total number of trays - (Number of trips * Number of trays per trip)
- Remaining trays = 36 - (9 * 4)
- Remaining trays = 36 - 36
- Remaining trays = 0

Since there are no remaining trays, we can conclude that Luke will make 9 trips to pick up all the trays.

The cafeteria handed out 42 apples to students.

Step 2: Calculate the number of apples left to make pies.
Initially, the cafeteria had 96 apples. After handing out 42 apples to students, the number of apples left is:
96 - 42 = 54

Step 3: Determine how many pies can be made with the remaining apples.
Each pie takes 6 apples. To find out how many pies can be made with 54 apples, we divide the number of apples by the number of apples per pie:
54 ÷ 6 = 9

Therefore, the cafeteria can make 9 pies with the remaining apples.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
- Henry had 3 action figures.
- He needed 8 action figures in total for a complete collection.
- Each action figure costs $6.

Step 2: Determine the number of action figures Henry still needs to buy.
Since Henry already has 3 action figures and he needs 8 in total, he needs to buy:
8 (total needed) - 3 (already has) = 5 action figures.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the action figures Henry needs to buy.
Each action figure costs $6, so the total cost for 5 action figures is:
5 (number of action figures) x $6 (cost per action figure) = $30.

Step 4: Determine the total amount of money Henry needs to finish his collection.
Based on the calculation in Step 3, Henry needs $30 to finish his collection.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Convert the given amounts into a standard format (dollars and cents).
- Frank initially had $3.00.
- He received $0.37 for his allowance.

Step 2: Add the initial amount and the allowance to find the total amount of money Frank has.
- Total amount = $3.00 + $0.37
- Total amount = $3.37

Step 3: Determine how many $0.88 toys Frank can buy with the total amount of money he has.
- To find out how many $0.88 toys Frank can buy, we need to divide the total amount of money by the cost of one toy.
- Number of toys = Total amount / Cost of one toy
- Number of toys = $3.37 / $0.88

Step 4: Perform the division to find the number of toys Frank can buy.
- Number of toys ≈ $3.37 / $0.88
- Number of toys ≈ 3.82

Since we can't buy a fraction of a toy, we round down to the nearest whole number.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Vanessa and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. 
   - This information is just a background detail and doesn't affect the problem.

2. Vanessa picked 17 carrots and her mother picked 14 carrots.
   - We can add these two numbers together to get the total number of carrots picked: 17 + 14 = 31

3. Only 24 of the carrots were good.
   - This means that the remaining carrots are bad.

4. To find the number of bad carrots, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked.
   - First, we need to subtract the number of good carrots (24) from the total number of carrots (31) to get the number of bad carrots: 31 - 24 = 7

Therefore, Vanessa and her mom had 7 bad carrots.

To find the number of people on each team, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of teams.

Step 1: Identify the total number of people.
The problem states that there are 23 managers and 7 employees. However, the question does not explicitly state that all 23 managers and 7 employees are participating in the game. Therefore, we will assume that all of them are participating.

Total number of people = 23 (managers) + 7 (employees) = 30

Step 2: Divide the total number of people by the number of teams.
The problem states that the people will be split into 6 teams.

Number of teams = 6

To find the number of people on each team, we will divide the total number of people by the number of teams.

Number of people on each team = Total number of people / Number of teams

To solve this problem, we need to find out how much flour Tiffany has already used and then subtract that from the total amount of flour she needs to determine how much more flour she requires.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of flour Tiffany used.
Tiffany baked 8 brownies and used 8 cups of flour for each one. So, the total amount of flour she used is:
8 brownies * 8 cups of flour/brownie = 64 cups of flour

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of flour Tiffany needs.
She needs 17 brownies for her party, and each brownie requires 8 cups of flour. So, the total amount of flour she needs is:
17 brownies * 8 cups of flour/brownie = 136 cups of flour

Step 3: Calculate the amount of flour Tiffany still needs.
To find out how much flour Tiffany still needs, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already used (64 cups) from the total amount of flour she needs (136 cups):

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of carrots picked and then multiply it by the percentage of bad carrots to find the number of bad carrots.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of carrots picked by Carol and her mom.
Carol picked 29 carrots and her mom picked 16 carrots.
Total carrots = 29 + 16 = 45

Step 2: Convert the percentage of good carrots to a decimal to find the percentage of bad carrots.
Only 38% of the carrots were good, so the percentage of bad carrots is 100% - 38% = 62%.

Step 3: Convert the percentage of bad carrots to a decimal.
62% as a decimal is 0.62.

Step 4: Multiply the total number of carrots by the percentage of bad carrots to find the number of bad carrots.
Number of bad carrots = Total carrots * Percentage of bad carrots
= 45 * 0.62
= 27.9

Since we can't have a fraction of a carrot, we'll round the number of bad carrots to the nearest whole number.

There were 8 friends playing the game initially. Each player had 6 lives.

Initial number of players: 8
Lives per player: 6

Step 2: Calculate the total lives of the initial players.
To find the total lives of the initial players, we multiply the number of players by the lives per player.

Total lives of initial players = 8 players * 6 lives/player = 48 lives

Step 3: Identify the number of new players joining the game.
2 more players joined the game.

New players: 2

Step 4: Calculate the total lives of the new players.
Each new player also had 6 lives.

Total lives of new players = 2 players * 6 lives/player = 12 lives

Step 5: Calculate the total lives of all players (initial and new).
To find the total lives of all players, we add the total lives of the initial players and the new players.

Total lives of all players = Total lives of initial players + Total lives of new players
= 48 lives + 12 lives
= 60 lives

Therefore, the total lives they had is 60.

She now has 78 - 30 = 48 pieces of candy left.

Step 3: Bianca placed the rest of the candy into piles with 8 pieces in each pile.
We need to find out how many piles she can make with the remaining 48 pieces of candy.

Step 4: To find the number of piles, we'll divide the total number of candies left by the number of candies in each pile.
Number of piles = Total candies left / Number of candies in each pile

                    question:
                     ; At a restaurant each adult meal costs! $8 and kids? eat ; free. If a group of 11 people came in : and 2 were. kids, how much would it cost! for the group to eat?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for the adults and add it to the cost for the kids (which is zero, since they eat for free).

Step 1: Calculate the number of adults.
There are 11 people in total, and 2 of them are kids. So, the number of adults is 11 - 2 = 9.

Step 2: Calculate the cost for the adults.
Each adult meal costs $8, and there are 9 adults. So, the cost for the adults is 9 * $8 = $72.

Step 3: Calculate the cost for the kids.
Since kids eat for free, the cost for the kids is $0.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for the group.
The total cost is the sum of the cost for the adults and the cost for the kids. So, the total cost is $72 + $0 = $72.

{The final answer is $72}.<|eot_id|>",72,72.0,72.0

                   !  Roger had 25 books. If, he, sold 21 of : them : and! used, the. money! he : earned to buy? 30 new books, how, many! books! would Roger have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the initial number of books Roger had.
Roger initially had 25 books.

Step 2: Determine the number of books Roger sold.
Roger sold 21 books.

Step 3: Calculate the number of books Roger had left after selling 21 books.
To find the number of books left, we subtract the number of books sold from the initial number of books:
25 (initial books) - 21 (books sold) = 4 books left

Step 4: Understand how the money earned from selling books was used.
The money earned from selling 21 books was used to buy 30 new books.

Step 5: Determine the number of books Roger would have after buying 30 new books with the money earned.
Since the money earned was used to buy new books, we need to add the new books to the remaining books, but we don't need to add the money earned because it was used to buy new books.
So, we just add the new books to the remaining books:
4 (remaining books) + 30 (new books) = 34 books

However, we also need to consider the money earned from selling the 21 books. If he sold 21 books for the price of 21 books, then he would have 21 dollars. Since he bought 30 books for 21 dollars, he would not have enough money to buy 30 books. He would only be able to buy 21 books for the price of 21 books. So the correct calculation should be:
4 (remaining books) + 21 (new books) = 25

Since Roger had 25 books initially, and he bought 21 new books, he would have 25 - 4 = 21 books left.<|eot_id|>",34,34.0,21.0

Step 2: Calculate the number of lives Wendy lost in the hard part of the game.
Wendy lost 6 lives.

Step 3: Subtract the lives lost from the initial number of lives to find the remaining lives.
Remaining lives = Initial lives - Lives lost
Remaining lives = 10 - 6
Remaining lives = 4

Step 4: Calculate the number of lives Wendy gained in the next level.
Wendy gained 37 more lives.

Step 5: Add the lives gained to the remaining lives to find the total number of lives Wendy now has.

To solve this problem, we'll follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the amount of money Frank had left after buying new mower blades:

Frank made 19 dollars, and he spent 11 dollars on mower blades. To find out how much he had left, we'll subtract the amount he spent from the amount he made:

19 (dollars made) - 11 (dollars spent) = 8 dollars left

2. Determine how many 2-dollar games Frank can buy with the money he has left:

Since Frank has 8 dollars left, and each game costs 2 dollars, we'll divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game:

8 (dollars left) ÷ 2 (dollars per game) = 4

Therefore, Frank can buy 4 games with the money he has left.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Nancy started with 80 files and deleted 31 files.
Number of files left = 80 - 31
= 49

Step 2: Calculate the number of folders Nancy can create with 7 files in each one.
Since each folder contains 7 files, we need to divide the number of files left by 7 to find the number of folders.
Number of folders = Number of files left / 7
= 49 / 7
= 7

However, since 7 * 7 = 49, there are no files left over after creating 7 folders. 

Therefore, Nancy ended up with 7 folders.

2. He sold 19 games, so we need to subtract 19 from 39 to find out how many games he has left:
   39 - 19 = 20
   He has 20 games left.

3. He packed the rest of the games into boxes, with 4 games in each box.
4. To find out how many boxes he needs, we need to divide the number of games he has left (20) by the number of games per box (4):

To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, let's find out how many pictures Isabel put into the rest of the albums, not the first one. She put 10 pictures into the first album. Since she uploaded 25 pictures in total, the number of pictures in the rest of the albums is:
   25 (total pictures) - 10 (pictures in the first album) = 15 pictures

2. Now, we need to divide the 15 pictures into 5 different albums. To do this, we will divide 15 by 5:
   15 (pictures to be divided) ÷ 5 (number of albums) = 3

So, the number of pictures in each album (except the first one) is 3.

3. Now, let's find the number of pictures in the first album:

To find out how long the money will last Mike, we need to calculate his total earnings and then divide that by the amount he spends per week.

Step 1: Calculate Mike's total earnings.
Mike made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 26 dollars weed eating.
Total earnings = 14 + 26 = 40 dollars

Step 2: Calculate how much money Mike has left after spending 5 dollars per week.
Since we don't know how many weeks the money will last, let's assume the total number of weeks is 'x'.
Mike's weekly spending is 5 dollars.
So, his total spending in 'x' weeks = 5x dollars

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Mike will have left after 'x' weeks.
Total earnings - Total spending = Total amount of money left
40 - 5x = Total amount of money left

Step 4: Since the problem asks ""how long the money last him"", we need to find the value of 'x' when the total amount of money left is zero.
Set the total amount of money left equal to zero and solve for 'x':
40 - 5x = 0
5x = 40
x = 40 / 5
x = 8

This means that Mike's money will last for 8 weeks.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of files Vanessa had initially. 
Total music files = 16
Total video files = 48
Total files = 16 + 48 = 64

Step 2: Calculate the number of files Vanessa deleted. 
The problem states that she deleted 30% of the files. 
30% of 64 = (30/100) * 64 = 0.3 * 64 = 19.2

Since we can't delete a fraction of a file, we will round down to the nearest whole number. 
So, Vanessa deleted 19 files.

Step 3: Calculate the number of files still on the flash drive. 
Total files initially = 64
Files deleted = 19
Files still on the flash drive = Total files initially - Files deleted = 64 - 19 = 45

However, the problem asks for the answer in terms of the question marks (?), which are the percentage and the type of files (music or video). Since the percentage is given as 30% and the type of files is not specified, we will assume the question is asking for the number of files still on the flash drive in terms of the percentage and the type of files.

Let's denote the number of music files still on the flash drive as M and the number of video files still on the flash drive as V.

Step 4: Calculate the number of music files still on the flash drive. 
Total music files initially = 16
Music files deleted = 30% of 16 = 0.3 * 16 = 4.8 (round down to 4)
Music files still on the flash drive = Total music files initially - Music files deleted = 16 - 4 = 12

Step 5: Calculate the number of video files still on the flash drive. 
Total video files initially = 48
Video files deleted = 30% of 48 = 0.3 * 48 = 14.4 (round down to 14)
Video files still on the flash drive = Total video files initially - Video files deleted = 48 - 14 = 34

However, the question asks for the total number of files still on the flash drive, not the number of music files and video files separately.

Step 2: Determine the number of shirts Dave washed before school started.
Dave washed 20 shirts before school started.

Step 3: Calculate the number of shirts Dave did not wash.
To find the number of shirts Dave did not wash, we need to subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts.

Since all the puppies need to be adopted, the number of puppies that need to be adopted is equal to the total number of puppies.
Puppies to be adopted = Total puppies
Puppies to be adopted = 36

Step 3: Calculate the number of days it would take to adopt all the puppies.
The shelter adopts 4 puppies per day.
To find the number of days, we need to divide the number of puppies to be adopted by the number of puppies adopted per day.
Days to adopt all puppies = Puppies to be adopted / Puppies adopted per day
Days to adopt all puppies = 36 / 4

Step 4: Perform the division to find the number of days.
Days to adopt all puppies = 36 / 4
Days to adopt all puppies = 9

Will had 59 pieces of clothing.

Step 2: Determine the number of pieces left after putting 32 pieces in one load.
Pieces left = Total pieces - Pieces in one load
Pieces left = 59 - 32
Pieces left = 27

Step 3: Calculate the number of pieces that can go in each of the 9 small loads.
Since the remaining pieces are split into 9 equal loads, we need to divide the number of pieces left by 9.
Pieces in each small load = Pieces left / 9
Pieces in each small load = 27 / 9

Step 4: Perform the division to find the number of pieces in each small load.
Pieces in each small load = 3

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of chocolate candy and caramel candy, and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of boxes of chocolate candy.
Adam bought 2 boxes of chocolate candy. Each box has 4 pieces inside it. So, the total number of chocolate candy pieces is:
2 boxes * 4 pieces/box = 8 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the total number of boxes of caramel candy.
Adam bought 5 boxes of caramel candy. Each box has 4 pieces inside it. So, the total number of caramel candy pieces is:
5 boxes * 4 pieces/box = 20 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the total number of candy pieces.
To find the total number of candy pieces, we add the number of chocolate candy pieces and caramel candy pieces:

To find the number of new books Victor bought, we first need to find the total number of books he bought. 

Step 1: Calculate the total number of books Victor bought. 
We know that Victor bought 32 adventure books and an unknown number of mystery books. Let's represent the unknown number of mystery books as 'x'. 

Since the problem states that Victor bought? 37 mystery books, it means he bought either 37 or fewer than 37 mystery books. However, to find the total number of books, we need to consider the maximum possible value of mystery books. 

So, the total number of books Victor bought is 32 (adventure books) + 37 (mystery books) = 69.

Step 2: Subtract the number of books used from the total number of books to find the number of new books.
We know that 16 books were used. 

To find the number of new books, subtract the number of used books from the total number of books. 
Number of new books = Total number of books - Number of used books
= 69 - 16

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria initially picked 48 carrots from her garden.

2. She threw out 11 carrots, so we need to subtract 11 from 48 to find out how many carrots she has left. 
   48 - 11 = 37

3. The next day, she picked 15 more carrots. To find the total number of carrots she has now, we need to add 15 to the number of carrots she had left (37).

   37 + 15 = 52

Therefore, the total number of carrots Maria would have is 52.

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of roses sold.
The florist sold 15% of 50 roses. To find 15% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.15 (since 15% = 15/100 = 0.15).

50 * 0.15 = 7.5

So, the florist sold 7.5 roses. However, since we can't sell a fraction of a rose, we'll assume she sold 7 roses and kept 0.5 of a rose, which is negligible.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining number of roses after selling 15%.
The florist had 50 roses initially. After selling 7 roses, she has:
50 - 7 = 43 roses

Step 3: Add the number of roses picked later.
The florist picked 21 more roses. To find the total number of roses she would have, we add 21 to the remaining number of roses:
43 + 21 = 64

Therefore, the florist would have 64 roses.

To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Paul has in total. Then, we can divide that amount by the cost of one toy to find out how many toys he can buy.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Paul has.
Paul initially had 3 dollars. He received another 7 dollars for his allowance.
Total money = Initial money + Allowance
Total money = 3 + 7
Total money = 10 dollars

Step 2: Determine the cost of one toy.
The cost of one toy is given as 5 dollars.

Step 3: Calculate how many toys Paul can buy with his total money.
Number of toys = Total money / Cost of one toy
Number of toys = 10 / 5
Number of toys = 2

Wendy had 43 lives.

Step 2: Calculate the number of lives Wendy lost in the hard part of the game.
Wendy lost 8 lives.

Step 3: Subtract the lives lost from the initial number of lives to find out how many lives Wendy had left.
Lives left = Initial lives - Lives lost
Lives left = 43 - 8
Lives left = 35

Step 4: Identify the number of lives Wendy got in the next level.
Wendy got 39 more lives.

Step 5: Add the lives Wendy got in the next level to the lives she had left.
Total lives = Lives left + Lives gained
Total lives = 35 + 39
Total lives = 74

Therefore, Wendy would have 74 lives.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of files Katie had after deleting 40 of them.

Katie had 85 files initially. After deleting 40 of them, she is left with:
85 - 40 = 45 files

Step 2: Determine the number of files in each folder.

It's given that each folder has 5 files.

Step 3: Determine the number of folders Katie ended up with.

Since Katie has 45 files and each folder has 5 files, we can find the number of folders by dividing the total number of files by the number of files in each folder:
45 / 5 = 9

However, we need to check if there are any remaining files that didn't fit into a folder. Since 45 is divisible by 5, there are no remaining files.

Step 4: Determine the final number of folders.

Katie ended up with 9 folders.

Will worked 8 hours on Monday at $8 per hour. 
Earnings on Monday = Number of hours worked * Hourly wage
Earnings on Monday = 8 * $8
Earnings on Monday = $64

**Step 2: Calculate Will's earnings on Tuesday**
Will worked 2 hours on Tuesday at $8 per hour.
Earnings on Tuesday = Number of hours worked * Hourly wage
Earnings on Tuesday = 2 * $8
Earnings on Tuesday = $16

**Step 3: Calculate Will's total earnings for the two days**
Total earnings = Earnings on Monday + Earnings on Tuesday
Total earnings = $64 + $16
Total earnings = $80

The total number of members is given as 14.

Step 2: Identify the number of members who didn't show up during the game.
The number of members who didn't show up is given as 7.

Step 3: Calculate the number of members who showed up during the game.
To find the number of members who showed up, we need to subtract the number of members who didn't show up from the total number of members.
Number of members who showed up = Total number of members - Number of members who didn't show up

To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the number of books Oliver is left with after the librarian takes 10 books.
- Oliver started with 46 books.
- The librarian took 10 books, so Oliver is left with 46 - 10 = 36 books.

Step 2: Determine how many books Oliver can fit on one shelf.
- Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf.

Step 3: Calculate how many shelves Oliver will need to put away the remaining books.
- Since Oliver has 36 books and can fit 4 books on one shelf, we need to divide 36 by 4 to find the number of shelves needed.
- 36 / 4 = 9

Step 4: Confirm the result.
- Since 9 shelves can accommodate 9 * 4 = 36 books, Oliver will indeed need 9 shelves.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of quarters and dimes in each pile.
Since each pile has 3 coins, and there are 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes, we can multiply the number of piles by the number of coins per pile to find the total number of quarters and dimes.

For quarters: 5 piles * 3 coins/pile = 15 quarters
For dimes: 5 piles * 3 coins/pile = 15 dimes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of coins (quarters and dimes).
Since we have 15 quarters and 15 dimes, we can add these numbers together to find the total number of coins.

15 quarters + 15 dimes = 30 coins

Step 3: Determine if there are any other coins.
The problem mentions ""spare change"" and ""piles of quarters and dimes,"" but it does not mention any other types of coins. Therefore, we can assume that there are only quarters and dimes.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of coins.
Since there are no other coins, the total number of coins is equal to the number of coins we calculated in Step 2.

To find the total points earned by Gwen and her friends, we need to calculate the points earned by Gwen and the points earned by her friends separately, and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the points earned by Gwen.
Gwen recycled 5 pounds. Since they earn 1 point for every 3 pounds recycled, we can divide the number of pounds Gwen recycled by 3 to find the points she earned.
5 pounds / 3 pounds per point = 1.6667 points (approximately)

However, since points must be a whole number and Gwen can't earn a fraction of a point, we round down to the nearest whole number for Gwen, which is 1 point.

Step 2: Calculate the points earned by Gwen's friends.
Gwen's friends recycled 13 pounds. We can divide the number of pounds they recycled by 3 to find the points they earned.
13 pounds / 3 pounds per point = 4.3333 points (approximately)

We round down to the nearest whole number for Gwen's friends, which is 4 points.

Step 3: Add the points earned by Gwen and her friends to find the total points earned.
Total points = Gwen's points + Gwen's friends' points
Total points = 1 point + 4 points

Cost for Haley = 3 tickets * $4/ticket = $12

Step 2: Determine the number of tickets Haley bought for her friends.
She bought 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. Since she bought 3 tickets for herself, the remaining tickets (5) are for her friends.
Number of tickets for friends = 5 tickets

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the tickets Haley bought for her friends.
Cost for friends = Number of tickets for friends * $4/ticket = 5 tickets * $4/ticket = $20

2. Since Robin sorted the pictures into 9 different albums with the same amount of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

   Number of albums = 9
   Number of pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
   Number of pictures per album = 36 / 9

                    ? Mike made 69, dollars mowing lawns : over, the? summer. If? he. spent : 24 dollars : buying new mower blades,? how many, 5 dollar games could ; he! buy with the : money he? had left?.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Mike had left after buying new mower blades.

To do this, we need to subtract the cost of the new mower blades from the total amount of money Mike made.

Money made: $69
Cost of new mower blades: $24

Money left = Money made - Cost of new mower blades
Money left = $69 - $24
Money left = $45

Step 2: Determine how many 5-dollar games Mike can buy with the money he had left.

To do this, we need to divide the amount of money Mike had left by the cost of each game.

Money left: $45
Cost of each game: $5

Number of games = Money left / Cost of each game
Number of games = $45 / $5
Number of games = 9

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it took Maria to put together all the furniture.

Step 1: Determine the number of chairs and tables Maria bought.
Maria bought 2 chairs and 2 tables.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pieces of furniture.
Total number of pieces of furniture = 2 (chairs) + 2 (tables) = 4

Step 3: Determine the time it took to put together one piece of furniture.
Maria spent 8 minutes on each piece of furniture.

Step 4: Calculate the total time it took to put together all the furniture.
Total time = Total number of pieces of furniture * Time per piece
Total time = 4 * 8
Total time = 32 minutes

Therefore, it took Maria 32 minutes to finish putting together all the furniture.

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     While on vacation, Rachel took 6 pictures at the zoo and 9 at the museum. If. she later deleted 11 of the? pictures, how many pictures from her vacation did she still have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pictures Rachel took at the zoo and the museum.
   - She took 6 pictures at the zoo.
   - She took 9 pictures at the museum.
   So, the total number of pictures she took is 6 + 9 = 15.

2. Determine the number of pictures she deleted.
   - She deleted 11 pictures.

3. Since we don't know which type of pictures she deleted, we will consider two cases:
   - Case 1: She deleted 11 pictures from the zoo.
   - Case 2: She deleted 11 pictures from the museum.
   - Case 3: She deleted 11 pictures from both the zoo and the museum.

4. Now, let's analyze each case:
   - Case 1: If she deleted 11 pictures from the zoo, she would have 6 - 11 = -5 pictures from the zoo. Since we cannot have a negative number of pictures, this case is not possible.

   - Case 2: If she deleted 11 pictures from the museum, she would have 9 - 11 = -2 pictures from the museum. Again, this case is not possible.

   - Case 3: If she deleted 11 pictures from both the zoo and the museum, we need to determine the remaining number of pictures from each place. Let's say she deleted x pictures from the zoo and 11 - x pictures from the museum. Then, the remaining number of pictures from the zoo is 6 - x, and the remaining number of pictures from the museum is 9 - (11 - x) = x - 2.

5. To find the total number of pictures she still has, we need to add the remaining number of pictures from the zoo and the museum.

   - The remaining number of pictures from the zoo is 6 - x.
   - The remaining number of pictures from the museum is x - 2.

   - The total number of pictures she still has is (6 - x) + (x - 2).

   Since the question doesn't specify which type of pictures she deleted, we will assume that she deleted 11 pictures from both the zoo and the museum. Then, the equation (6 - x) + (x - 2) = 15 - 11 = 4.

   Solving the equation (6 - x) + (x - 2) = 4, we get:
   (6 - x) + (x - 2) = 4
   6 - 2 + x - x = 4
   4 = 4

   This equation is true for any value of x. However, we need to find the value of x.

   Since we assumed that she deleted 11 pictures from both the zoo and the museum, we can set up the equation:
   x + (11 - x) = 11
   x + x = 11
   2x = 11
   x = 11/2
   x = 5.5

   However, the number of pictures must be an integer. This is a contradiction, so our assumption that she deleted 11 pictures from both the zoo and the museum is incorrect.

   Since the assumption that she deleted 11 pictures from both the zoo and the museum is incorrect, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

   Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since the question doesn't specify which type of pictures she deleted, we will assume that she deleted 11 pictures from either the zoo or the museum.

   If she deleted 11 pictures from the zoo, she would have 6 - 11 = -5 pictures from the zoo. Since we cannot have a negative number of pictures, this case is not possible.

   If she deleted 11 pictures from the museum, she would have 9 - 11 = -2 pictures from the museum. Again, this case is not possible.

   However, we can also assume that she deleted 11 pictures from the zoo and 0 pictures from the museum, or 0 pictures from the zoo and 11 pictures from the museum.

   If she deleted 11 pictures from the zoo and 0 pictures from the museum, she would have 6 - 11 = -5 pictures from the zoo and 9 pictures from the museum. The total number of pictures she still has is 9.

   If she deleted 0 pictures from the zoo and 11 pictures from the museum, she would have 6 pictures from the zoo and 9 - 11 = -2 pictures from the museum. The total number of pictures she still has is 6.

   If she deleted 11 pictures from the zoo and 0 pictures from the museum is not possible, but she could have deleted",4,4.0,0.0

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Maria has in total and then divide that number by the number of cookies in each baggie.

Step 1: Find the total number of cookies.
Maria has 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies. 

5 (chocolate chip cookies) + 19 (oatmeal cookies) = 24 cookies

Step 2: Divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in each baggie.
There are 8 cookies in each baggie.

24 (total cookies) ÷ 8 (cookies in each baggie) = 3

Since we can't make a fraction of a baggie, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

Therefore, Maria can make 3 baggies.

The problem states that each flower costs $3.

Step 2: Determine the total number of flowers Zoe bought.
Zoe bought 8 roses and 2 daisies. To find the total number of flowers, we add these two numbers together: 
8 (roses) + 2 (daisies) = 10 flowers.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the flowers.
Since each flower costs $3 and Zoe bought 10 flowers, we multiply the number of flowers by the cost of each flower:
10 (flowers) * $3 (per flower) = $30.

Therefore, Zoe spent $30 on the flowers.

- So, the total number of mystery books is 5 * 8 = 40 books.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of books on the picture book shelves.
- Bianca has 4 shelves of picture books.
- Each shelf has exactly 8 books.
- So, the total number of picture books is 4 * 8 = 32 books.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of books Bianca has.
- The total number of books is the sum of mystery books and picture books.
- Total number of books = 40 (mystery books) + 32 (picture books) = 72 books.

Isabel used 5 cups of flour for each brownie, and she baked 3 brownies. 
So, the total amount of flour she used is 5 cups/brownie * 3 brownies = 15 cups.

Step 2: Determine the total amount of flour Isabel needs.
Isabel needs a total of 5 brownies for her party, and she needs 5 cups of flour for each brownie.
So, the total amount of flour she needs is 5 cups/brownie * 5 brownies = 25 cups.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of flour Isabel still needs.
To find out how much flour Isabel still needs, we need to subtract the amount she used from the total amount she needs.
So, the amount of flour she still needs is 25 cups (total needed) - 15 cups (used) = 10 cups.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the number of questions in each half.
Since Adam answered 8 questions correct in the first half and 2 questions correct in the second half, we can assume that the number of questions in each half is the same, as the problem does not specify the total number of questions.

Step 2: Calculate the number of questions in each half.
Let's assume the number of questions in each half is x. Since Adam answered 8 questions correct in the first half, and 2 questions correct in the second half, we can set up an equation:

x + x = total number of questions
Since the total number of questions is not given, we will assume that the total number of questions is 10 (5 questions in each half), but this is not explicitly stated.

Step 3: Determine the total number of questions Adam answered correctly.
Adam answered 8 questions correct in the first half and 2 questions correct in the second half, so the total number of questions Adam answered correctly is:

8 + 2 = 10

Step 4: Calculate the total score Adam earned.
Since each question was worth 8 points, we can multiply the total number of questions Adam answered correctly by the number of points per question to get the total score:

10 * 8 = 80

However, we need to verify that our assumption about the total number of questions is correct. If the total number of questions is indeed 10, then Adam's score should be 80.

Step 5: Verify the assumption about the total number of questions.
Since the problem states that Adam answered 8 questions correct in the first half and 2 questions correct in the second half, we can assume that the total number of questions is indeed 10.

Step 6: Calculate the final score.
The final score is the total score Adam earned, which is 80.

Paul filled 6 bags on Saturday and 3 more bags on Sunday. 
Total bags = 6 (Saturday) + 3 (Sunday) = 9 bags.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cans in the bags.
Each bag contains 18 cans. 
Total cans in 9 bags = 9 * 18 = 162 cans.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cans Paul collected.
The total number of cans is equal to the total number of cans in the bags.
Total cans = 162 cans.

If Bianca recycled, 24 pounds and her friends recycled 3 pounds, how! many points did they ; earn?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many points Bianca and her friends earned.

Step 1: Determine how many points Bianca earned.
Bianca recycled 24 pounds. For every 3 pounds, they earned 1 point. 
So, we need to divide 24 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pounds Bianca recycled.
24 / 3 = 8

Since they earn 1 point for every 3 pounds, Bianca earned 8 points.

Step 2: Determine how many points Bianca's friends earned.
Bianca's friends recycled 3 pounds. 
We already know that for every 3 pounds, they earn 1 point.
So, we need to divide 3 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pounds Bianca's friends recycled.
3 / 3 = 1

Since they earn 1 point for every 3 pounds, Bianca's friends earned 1 point.

Step 3: Calculate the total points earned by Bianca and her friends.
Add the points earned by Bianca and her friends.
8 (Bianca's points) + 1 (friends' points) = 9

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of chicken wings cooked.
The chef already had 8 chicken wings cooked and then cooked 10 more. So, the total number of chicken wings cooked is 8 + 10 = 18.

Step 2: Determine the total number of friends.
The problem states that there are 3 friends.

Step 3: Divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends to determine how many each person will get.
To do this, we will divide 18 (the total number of chicken wings) by 3 (the number of friends).

18 ÷ 3 = 6

Step 4: Determine the final answer.
Since we are looking for the number of chicken wings each person will get, the final answer is the result of the division.

To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Identify the initial number of socks John had.**
John had 33 socks initially.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of socks John threw away.**
John threw away 19 old socks.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of socks John had after throwing away the old ones.**
To find the number of socks left after throwing away 19, we subtract 19 from the initial number of socks:
33 - 19 = 14

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of socks John had after buying new ones.**
John bought 13 new socks. To find the total number of socks he now has, we add the number of new socks to the number of socks he had left:
14 + 13 = 27

Therefore, John now has 27 socks.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of players**
The team has 2 new players and 6 returning players. To find the total number of players, we add these two numbers together:
Total number of players = 2 (new players) + 6 (returning players) = 8

**Step 2: Determine the number of players in each group**
The coach puts the players into groups with 4 players in each group.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of groups**
To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group:
Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
= 8 / 4
= 2

Therefore, there would be 2 groups.

                    :  ; A painter needed to paint 6 rooms. in? a building. Each room takes? 5 ; hours to paint. If he already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the : rest?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total time it takes to paint all 6 rooms.
Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the total time it takes to paint all 6 rooms is:
6 rooms * 5 hours/room = 30 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time the painter has already spent painting 2 rooms.
The painter has already painted 2 rooms, so the time spent is:
2 rooms * 5 hours/room = 10 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time the painter has left to paint the rest of the rooms.
To find this, we subtract the time already spent from the total time:
30 hours (total time) - 10 hours (time already spent) = 20 hours

Step 4: Since the painter needs to paint the remaining 4 rooms, calculate the time it takes to paint these rooms.
The time it takes to paint the remaining 4 rooms is:
4 rooms * 5 hours/room = 20 hours

Step 5: Determine how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest of the rooms.
Since the painter needs to paint the remaining rooms for 20 hours, and he already spent 10 hours, the time he has left is still 20 hours.

However, the question asks for how much longer he will take to paint the rest, implying we should consider the remaining time for the remaining rooms. Since the painter already painted 2 rooms, he still has to paint 4 rooms which takes 20 hours, and the question is asking for how much longer he will take, we should consider the time he already spent which is 10 hours. 

So the answer should be the remaining time for the remaining rooms which is 20 hours.<|eot_id|>",20,20.0,20.0

Step 4: Determine how many books Roger can fit on a shelf.
Roger can fit 3 books on a shelf.

Step 5: Calculate the number of shelves Roger will need to put away the remaining books.
To find the number of shelves needed, we divide the total number of books left by the number of books that can fit on a shelf:
12 books / 3 books per shelf = 4 shelves.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, and we are dividing whole numbers, we can simply divide 12 by 3 without having to round up.

To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we need to calculate the number of birds in each cage and then multiply it by the number of cages.

Step 1: Calculate the number of birds in each cage.
Each cage has 2 parrots and 7 parakeets. So, the total number of birds in each cage is:
2 (parrots) + 7 (parakeets) = 9 birds per cage

Step 2: Multiply the number of birds in each cage by the number of cages.
The pet store has 6 cages, and each cage has 9 birds. So, the total number of birds in the pet store is:
6 (cages) * 9 (birds per cage) = 54

Step 3: Verify the calculation.
To verify, we can also calculate the total number of parrots and parakeets separately and then add them together.
Total number of parrots: 6 (cages) * 2 (parrots per cage) = 12
Total number of parakeets: 6 (cages) * 7 (parakeets per cage) = 42

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts.
   Total shirts to be washed = 9 + 27 = 36

2. He had only washed 20% of them by the time school started.
   To find 20% of 36 shirts, we multiply 36 by 0.20 (20% as a decimal).
   36 * 0.20 = 7.2

   Since we can't have a fraction of a shirt, we round 7.2 to the nearest whole number.
   7.2 ≈ 7 (rounded down)

   This means Dave washed 7 shirts.

3. To find the number of shirts Dave did not wash, we subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts.

To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pictures taken by Haley.
Haley took 50 pictures at the zoo and 8 pictures at the museum. 
Total pictures taken = 50 (at the zoo) + 8 (at the museum)
Total pictures taken = 58

Step 2: Calculate the number of pictures deleted by Haley.
Haley deleted 38% of the pictures. 
To find 38% of the total pictures, we need to multiply the total pictures by 0.38 (since 38% = 38/100 = 0.38).
Number of pictures deleted = 0.38 * Total pictures
Number of pictures deleted = 0.38 * 58
Number of pictures deleted = 22.04 (round to 22, since we cannot delete a fraction of a picture)

Step 3: Calculate the number of pictures Haley still has.
To find the number of pictures Haley still has, we need to subtract the number of pictures deleted from the total number of pictures taken.
Number of pictures still have = Total pictures taken - Number of pictures deleted
Number of pictures still have = 58 - 22

To find the total number of roses the florist has, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: The florist initially had 5 roses.

Step 2: She sold 3 roses. To find out how many roses she has left after selling 3, we subtract 3 from 5:
   5 (initial roses) - 3 (sold roses) = 2

Step 3: Then, she picked 34 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we add 34 to the number of roses she had left after selling 3:
   2 (roses left) + 34 (new roses) = 36

Therefore, the florist now has 36 roses.

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of sodas Cody bought and then divide that by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sodas Cody bought.
Cody bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas.
Total number of sodas = 4 (regular) + 44 (diet) = 48

Step 2: Calculate the number of shelves Cody would fill up.
Each shelf can hold 6 sodas.
Number of shelves = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
= 48 / 6
= 8

Therefore, Cody would fill up 8 shelves.

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of groups that can be made by splitting the students into groups of 9.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of students.
Total number of students = number of boys + number of girls
= 26 + 46
= 72

Step 2: Determine the number of students in each group.
Number of students in each group = 9

Step 3: Divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group to find the number of groups.
Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students in each group

To find the number of extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of apples ordered by the cafeteria.
The cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples.
Total apples ordered = 6 (red apples) + 15 (green apples) = 21 apples

Step 2: Calculate the number of apples needed for the 5 students who wanted fruit.
Since each student gets one apple (assuming it's one apple per student), the number of apples needed for 5 students is 5.

Step 3: Calculate the number of extra apples the cafeteria ended up with.
To find the number of extra apples, subtract the number of apples needed for the 5 students from the total number of apples ordered.
Extra apples = Total apples ordered - Apples needed for 5 students
Extra apples = 21 - 5
Extra apples = 16

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 16 extra apples.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Initially, there were 4 books in the bargain bin.

Step 2: The store sold 3 books. To find out how many books are left, we subtract the number of books sold from the initial number of books.

4 (initial books) - 3 (books sold) = 1 book left in the bargain bin.

Step 3: The store then put 10 more books in the bin. To find the total number of books in the bin now, we add the remaining books to the new books.

1 (book left) + 10 (new books) = 11 books in the bin.

However, we need to consider the given punctuation marks (!,?, :, ;, and :) in the problem. It seems like the numbers and words are separated by these marks. If we follow this pattern, the given numbers are 4, 3, and 10. But the word ""book"" is separated from the numbers by a colon (:). So, we need to consider the word ""book"" as part of the number. 

4 (four books) - 3 (three books) = 1 book left
1 (one book) + 10 (ten more books) = 11 books in the bin.

However, the correct way to read the given numbers is 4 books, 3 books, and 10 more books. If we consider the word ""book"" as part of the number, we can say there are 4 books, 3 books, and 10 more books. This will make the problem confusing.

If we consider the given numbers as 4, 3, and 10, then the correct solution is:

4 - 3 = 1 book left
1 + 10 = 11 books in the bin.

But considering the given punctuation marks, the correct interpretation of the problem is:

The store had 4 books in the bargain bin. They sold 3 books. Then, they put 10 more books in the bin.

So, the correct answer is 11 books in the bin.

Mike made $42, and he spent $10, so he had:
$42 - $10 = $32 left.

Step 3: Calculate how many $8 dollar games Mike could buy with the money he had left.
To find out how many games Mike could buy, we need to divide the amount of money he had left ($32) by the cost of one game ($8).
$32 ÷ $8 = 4

Therefore, Mike could buy 4 games with the money he had left.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

The chef needs to cook 13 potatoes and has already cooked 5. So, the number of potatoes left to cook is:
13 (total potatoes) - 5 (cooked potatoes) = 8 potatoes left

Step 2: Calculate the total time it will take to cook the remaining potatoes.
Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook. To find the total time, multiply the number of potatoes left by the cooking time per potato:
8 (potatoes left) * 6 (minutes per potato) = 48 minutes

Therefore, it will take the chef 48 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

                    question:
                    . Paige? had 43 math problems and? 12 science problems for homework. If ; she finished 44 of the problems at, school, how. many problems! did she have. to, do for? homework?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Paige has 43 math problems and an unknown number of science problems. However, we are given that she has 12 science problems. So, we can say that Paige has a total of 43 (math) + 12 (science) = 55 problems.

2. Since the number of science problems is already known (12), we can ignore it for now and focus on the math problems. Paige finished 44 problems at school. We need to find out how many math problems she has left to do for homework.

3. To find out how many math problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems she finished (44) from the total number of math problems (43). However, since 43 is less than 44, we need to consider the total number of problems (55) and the number of science problems (12) to get the correct answer.

4. First, we find out how many problems she finished in total (math + science). We know she finished 44 math problems and an unknown number of science problems. Since she finished 44 out of 55 problems, we can set up an equation to find out how many science problems she finished: 44 + x = 55, where x is the number of science problems she finished. Solving for x, we get x = 55 - 44 = 11. So, she finished 11 science problems.

5. Now, we know she finished 44 math problems and 11 science problems. We need to find out how many math problems she has left to do for homework. Since she finished 44 out of 43 math problems, she must have done all 43 math problems at school. However, we need to find out how many math problems she has left to do in total (43 + 12). Since she finished 11 out of 12 science problems, she must have done 1 science problem at home.

6. To find out how many math problems she has left to do in total, we add the number of math problems she has left to do (43) to the number of science problems she has left to do (12 - 11 = 1). However, this is not the correct approach. The correct approach is to find out how many problems she has left to do in total and then subtract the number of math problems she has already finished.

7. We know she finished 44 out of 55 problems. To find out how many problems she has left to do, we subtract the number of problems she finished (44) from the total number of problems (55). This gives us 55 - 44 = 11. So, she has 11 problems left to do.

8. Since we know she has 11 math problems left to do and 1 science problem left to do, we can say that the total number of problems she has left to do is 11 + 1 = 12.

However, the question asks for the number of problems she has to do for homework, not the total number of problems she has left to do. Since we know she finished all 43 math problems at school, she must have had 43 math problems to do for homework. We also know she finished 11 out of 12 science problems at school, so she must have had 11 science problems to do for homework.

9. To find out the total number of problems she has to do for homework, we add the number of math problems she has to do (43) to the number of science problems she has to do (11). This gives us 43 + 11 = 54.

However, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is the number of problems she has to do for homework, which is not the total number of problems she has left to do. We know she finished all 43 math problems at school, but we don't know if she finished all 12 science problems at school. Since she finished 11 out of 12 science problems at school, she must have finished 1 science problem at home. This means she must have had 1 science problem to do for homework.

10. To find out the total number of problems she has to do for homework, we add the number of math problems she has to do (43) to the number of science problems she has to do (1). This gives us 43 + 1 = 44.

However, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is the number of problems she has to do for homework, not the total number of problems she has left to do. We know she finished all 43 math problems at school, but we don't know if she finished all 12 science problems at school.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the flowers**: Since each flower costs 8 dollars, we multiply the cost of one flower by the total number of flowers to get the total cost. 
   Total cost = Cost of one flower * Total number of flowers
   Total cost = 8 * 6
   Total cost = 48

Total number of pieces = 8 + 23
Total number of pieces = 31

Step 2: Determine the number of pieces they ate on the first night.
They ate 8 pieces on the first night.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pieces they have left.
To find the number of pieces they have left, we subtract the number of pieces they ate from the total number of pieces.
Pieces left = Total number of pieces - Pieces eaten

                    question:
                     A pet. store had 88 puppies.. In? one day they! sold 34 of them and put! the rest into cages with 6 in each! cage. How. many, cages did they? use?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find the number of cages used, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of puppies left after selling 34.
88 (initial puppies) - 34 (puppies sold) = 54 puppies left

Step 2: Determine the number of puppies that can fit into one cage.
Each cage can hold 6 puppies.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cages needed to accommodate the remaining puppies.
Divide the number of puppies left (54) by the number of puppies that can fit into one cage (6).
54 puppies / 6 puppies per cage = 9 cages

Therefore, the pet store used 9 cages to put the rest of the puppies into.

To find out how many trips Jerry will make, we need to calculate the total number of trays he needs to pick up and then divide that number by the number of trays he can carry at a time.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of trays Jerry needs to pick up.
- 9 trays from one table
- 7 trays from another table
Total trays = 9 + 7 = 16

Step 2: Since Jerry can only carry 8 trays at a time, we need to divide the total number of trays by 8 to find out how many trips he will make.
Trips = Total trays / 8

However, since Jerry can't make a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if there are any remaining trays. 

Step 3: Divide the total number of trays by 8.
16 / 8 = 2

Since 16 is not a multiple of 8, we need to find out how many trays Jerry will have left after 2 trips.
- 2 trips * 8 trays per trip = 16 trays (which is exactly what he needs to pick up)

Since Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, he will make 2 trips.

To find Faye's score, we need to calculate the total points she earned from the treasures she found on both levels.

Step 1: Calculate the points Faye earned from the first level.
- She found 2 treasures on the first level.
- Each treasure is worth 7 points.
- So, the points from the first level = 2 * 7 = 14 points.

Step 2: Calculate the points Faye earned from the second level.
- She found 6 treasures on the second level.
- Each treasure is worth 7 points.
- So, the points from the second level = 6 * 7 = 42 points.

Step 3: Add the points from both levels to get the total score.
- Total score = points from the first level + points from the second level
- Total score = 14 + 42 = 56 points.

Therefore, Faye's score would be 56 points.

19 - 4 = 15

Step 3: Megan then picked 46 more carrots the next day.

To find the total number of carrots she has now, we need to add the 46 new carrots to the 15 carrots she had left.

To find the number of folders Wendy ended up with, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of files Wendy had left after deleting 37 files.
Wendy initially had 82 files. After deleting 37, she had:
82 - 37 = 45 files left.

Step 2: Determine how many files will be in each folder.
Wendy put the remaining files into folders with 5 files in each.

Step 3: Calculate the number of folders needed to accommodate the remaining files.
To find the number of folders, we need to divide the total number of remaining files by the number of files in each folder:
45 (remaining files) / 5 (files per folder) = 9

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a folder, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if necessary. In this case, 9 is a whole number, so we do not need to round up.

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of players and divide it by the number of players in each group.

- The school has 12 new players.
- The school has 44 returning players.
Total number of players = 12 (new players) + 44 (returning players) = 56 players.

Step 2: Divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.
- The coach puts the players into groups with 8 players in each group.
- Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
= 56 / 8

Step 3: Calculate 56 / 8.
56 / 8 = 7

Since we are dividing the total number of players by the number of players in each group, the result should be a whole number. If there are any remaining players, they would form a group by themselves, but in this case, the result is a whole number.

Will started with $104. He spent $41 on mower blades. To find the amount of money left, we need to subtract the amount spent from the initial amount:

Money left = Initial amount - Amount spent
Money left = $104 - $41
Money left = $63

Step 2: Determine how many $9 games Will can buy with the money he had left.
To find out how many games Will can buy, we need to divide the amount of money left by the cost of each game:

Number of games = Money left / Cost of each game
Number of games = $63 / $9

Step 3: Calculate the number of games.
We can calculate the number of games by dividing $63 by $9:

To solve this problem, we will break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Determine the number of bags Sam filled on Saturday.**
The problem states that Sam filled 3 bags on Saturday.

**Step 2: Determine the number of bags Sam filled on Sunday.**
The problem states that Sam filled 4 more bags on Sunday. Since he already had 3 bags on Saturday, we need to add the 4 bags he filled on Sunday to the 3 bags he already had. However, we don't know what he filled on Sunday so we will call it ""x"" for now.

**Step 3: Write an equation to represent the total number of bags.**
Let's write an equation to represent the total number of bags: 3 + 4 = x
However, the problem is actually asking how many cans he picked up, not bags, so we need to write an equation for the total number of cans.

**Step 4: Determine the total number of bags.**
Since we know that Sam filled 3 bags on Saturday and 4 more bags on Sunday, we can write the equation as 3 + 4 = 7. So, the total number of bags is 7.

**Step 5: Write an equation to represent the total number of cans.**
Since each bag has 9 cans, we can multiply the total number of bags by the number of cans per bag to get the total number of cans: 7 * 9 = total number of cans

**Step 6: Calculate the total number of cans.**
7 * 9 = 63

To find out how many more problems the teacher has to grade, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of problems on all the worksheets.
There are 16 worksheets, each with 4 problems. So, the total number of problems is:
16 worksheets * 4 problems per worksheet = 64 problems

Step 2: Determine the number of problems the teacher has already graded.
The teacher had already graded 8 worksheets. Since each worksheet has 4 problems, the number of problems graded is:
8 worksheets * 4 problems per worksheet = 32 problems

Step 3: Calculate the number of problems the teacher has left to grade.
To find the number of problems left, subtract the number of problems already graded from the total number of problems:
64 total problems - 32 problems graded = 32 problems left

Step 4: Determine how many more problems the teacher has to grade.
Since each worksheet has 4 problems, the number of worksheets left to grade is:
32 problems left / 4 problems per worksheet = 8 worksheets left

However, we are asked to find the number of problems the teacher has to grade, not the number of worksheets.

                    question:
                    :  A? pet store had : 13! puppies.! In one, day they sold 7 of them and put the, rest into : cages with 2 in each ; cage.? How. many cages, did they? use? :<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of puppies and the number of puppies sold.
The pet store initially had 13 puppies, and they sold 7 of them.

Step 2: Calculate the number of puppies left after selling 7 of them.
puppies_left = initial_puppies - puppies_sold
puppies_left = 13 - 7
puppies_left = 6

Step 3: Determine the number of puppies that will be placed in each cage.
The pet store puts 2 puppies in each cage.

Step 4: Calculate the number of cages needed to accommodate the remaining puppies.
To find the number of cages, we'll divide the number of puppies left by the number of puppies per cage.
cages_needed = puppies_left / puppies_per_cage
cages_needed = 6 / 2
cages_needed = 3

Therefore, the pet store used 3 cages.<|eot_id|>",3,3.0,3.0

To solve this problem, let's follow the steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of carrots picked by Faye and her mom.
Faye picked 23 carrots and her mom picked 5 carrots. So, the total number of carrots picked is 23 + 5 = 28.

Step 2: Identify the number of good carrots.
It's given that only 12 carrots were good.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bad carrots.
Since the total number of carrots picked is 28 and 12 are good, the number of bad carrots can be found by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots.
Number of bad carrots = Total number of carrots - Number of good carrots
= 28 - 12
= 16

Therefore, the number of bad carrots is 16.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers Isabel picked, excluding the exclamation marks and question marks. 
66 flowers

Step 2: Since 10 of the flowers wilted, subtract 10 from the total number of flowers to find out how many flowers are still available.
66 - 10 = 56 flowers

Step 3: Since Isabel was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one, divide the number of available flowers by 8 to find out how many bouquets she can still make.
56 flowers / 8 flowers per bouquet = 7 bouquets

Step 4: Consider if there are any remaining flowers after making the bouquets. To do this, multiply the number of bouquets by the number of flowers per bouquet and subtract this from the total number of available flowers.
7 bouquets * 8 flowers per bouquet = 56 flowers
56 flowers - 56 flowers = 0 flowers remaining

Step 5: Since there are no remaining flowers, the number of bouquets Isabel can still make is the same as the result from step 3.

To find the total number of tickets Oliver used, we need to calculate the total number of tickets used for the ferris wheel and the bumper cars, and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tickets used for the ferris wheel.
Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times. Each ride costs 7 tickets. So, the total number of tickets used for the ferris wheel is:
5 (rides) * 7 (tickets/ride) = 35 tickets

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tickets used for the bumper cars.
Oliver rode the bumper cars 4 times. Each ride costs 7 tickets. So, the total number of tickets used for the bumper cars is:
4 (rides) * 7 (tickets/ride) = 28 tickets

Step 3: Add the total number of tickets used for the ferris wheel and the bumper cars to find the total number of tickets used.
Total tickets used = tickets used for ferris wheel + tickets used for bumper cars
= 35 tickets + 28 tickets
= 63 tickets

1. Calculate the total number of chairs and tables Wendy bought:
   - She bought 4 new chairs.
   - She bought 4 new tables.
   - Total number of chairs and tables = 4 + 4 = 8

2. Since the time it took to assemble each piece of furniture is the same, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the time it took to assemble one piece of furniture by the total number of pieces.
   - Time to assemble one piece of furniture = 6 minutes.
   - Total number of pieces of furniture = 8.
   - Total time = Time to assemble one piece * Total number of pieces
   - Total time = 6 * 8

3. Multiply 6 by 8:

Step 2: Calculate the number of cats left after the sale.
The pet store sold 45 cats during the sale. 
To find the number of cats left, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats they initially had.
So, the number of cats left is 63 - 45.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total points Carol had at the end of the game. We will break it down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total points Carol scored in the first two rounds.
In the first round, she scored 17 points.
In the second round, she scored 6 points.
Total points in the first two rounds = 17 + 6 = 23 points.

Step 2: Calculate the points Carol had at the end of the game.
In the last round, she lost 16 points. 
To find out how many points she had at the end of the game, we need to subtract the points she lost from the total points she scored in the first two rounds.
Points at the end of the game = Total points in the first two rounds - Points lost in the last round
= 23 - 16
= 7

However, the question asks for the points she had ""at the end of the game"" which implies we need to include the points from the last round before the loss. Thus, we should add the points she scored in the last round to the points she had before losing 16 points.

Step 3: Calculate the points Carol had at the end of the game, including the points from the last round.
Points scored in the first two rounds = 23
Points scored in the last round = 6
Total points before losing 16 points = 23 + 6 = 29
Points at the end of the game = Total points before losing 16 points - 16

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy. 

2. Each box contains 3 pieces of chocolate candy.

3. To find the total number of pieces Dave initially had, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces per box: 
   12 boxes * 3 pieces/box = 36 pieces

4. Dave gave 5 boxes to his little brother. Since each box contains 3 pieces, we need to find out how many pieces are in 5 boxes:
   5 boxes * 3 pieces/box = 15 pieces

5. Since Dave gave away 15 pieces, we need to subtract this from the total number of pieces he initially had:
   36 pieces - 15 pieces = 21 pieces

Step 2: During the lunch rush, he added another 12 customers to his list.

Step 3: To find the total number of customers, we need to add the initial number of customers to the number of customers added during the lunch rush.
Total customers = 39 + 12 = 51

Step 4: We are given that 49 of the customers didn't leave a tip. This means that the number of customers who left a tip is the total number of customers minus the number of customers who didn't leave a tip.
Customers who left a tip = Total customers - Customers who didn't leave a tip
Customers who left a tip = 51 - 49 = 2

Step 4: Identify the number of apples needed to make one pie.
Each pie takes 5 apples.

Step 5: Calculate the number of pies that can be made with the remaining apples.
To find the number of pies, we'll divide the number of apples left (45) by the number of apples needed to make one pie (5).

3. Since there are 8 boxes, the total number of scarves is 8 * 4 = 32 scarves.
4. Inside each box, there were also 6 mittens. 
5. Since there are 8 boxes, the total number of mittens is 8 * 6 = 48 mittens.
6. To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we need to add the total number of scarves and mittens.
7. Total number of winter clothing = 32 scarves + 48 mittens = 80 pieces.

                    question:
                     Frank. and his friend were. buying trick decks from the magic shop for 7 dollars each., How much! did they spend? if Frank bought 3 decks and his friend bought 2 ; decks? ;<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find out how much Frank and his friend spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the trick decks they bought.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the decks Frank bought.
Frank bought 3 decks at $7 each. 
Cost of Frank's decks = Number of decks * Price per deck
= 3 * $7
= $21

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the decks his friend bought.
His friend bought 2 decks at $7 each.
Cost of friend's decks = Number of decks * Price per deck
= 2 * $7
= $14

Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent by Frank and his friend.
Total amount spent = Cost of Frank's decks + Cost of friend's decks
= $21 + $14
= $35

{The final answer is $35}<|eot_id|>",35,35.0,35.0

                    question:
                     Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts, before school. If : he : had? only, washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find out how many shirts Sam did not wash, we need to first determine the total number of shirts he had to wash. 

Step 1: Calculate the total number of shirts Sam had to wash.
Total number of shirts = number of short sleeve shirts + number of long sleeve shirts
Total number of shirts = 40 + 23
Total number of shirts = 63

Step 2: Since Sam washed 29 shirts by the time school started, we need to subtract this number from the total number of shirts to find out how many he did not wash.
Number of shirts not washed = Total number of shirts - number of shirts washed
Number of shirts not washed = 63 - 29

Step 3: Calculate the number of shirts not washed.
Number of shirts not washed = 34

                    question:
                     A waiter had? 47 customers? to. wait on. If 41 customers ; left and he got another 20 customers,, how many ; customers would he have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

Step 1: The waiter initially had 47 customers to wait on.

Step 2: 41 customers left, so we need to subtract 41 from 47 to find the number of customers remaining. 
47 - 41 = 6

Step 3: The waiter got another 20 customers. We need to add 20 to the remaining customers (6) to find the total number of customers he would have now.
6 + 20 = 26

Therefore, the waiter would have 26 customers to wait on.
