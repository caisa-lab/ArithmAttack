                    question:
                     Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of the given situation.

Step 1: Paige initially had 11 songs on her mp3 player.

Step 2: She deleted 9 old songs from it. To find the remaining number of songs, we subtract the deleted songs from the initial number of songs.
Remaining songs = Initial songs - Deleted songs
Remaining songs = 11 - 9
Remaining songs = 2

Step 3: Then, she added 8 new songs to her mp3 player. To find the final number of songs, we add the new songs to the remaining number of songs.
Final songs = Remaining songs + New songs
Final songs = 2 + 8
Final songs = 10

Therefore, Paige now has 10 songs on her mp3 player.

                    question:
                     There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we first need to find out the total number of students trying out for the basketball team.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of students trying out for the basketball team.
Total number of students = number of girls + number of boys
Total number of students = 39 + 4
Total number of students = 43

Step 2: Since only 26 students got called back, we need to find out how many students were called back in addition to the ones who got called back, but are not part of the 26. 

Step 3: To find the number of students who didn't make the cut, we need to subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students trying out for the basketball team.

Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students - number of students who got called back
Number of students who didn't make the cut = 43 - 26

Step 4: Perform the subtraction to find the number of students who didn't make the cut.

Number of students who didn't make the cut = 17

To find the total number of coloring books Faye would have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of coloring books Faye had, which is 34.

2. Since Faye gave away 3 coloring books, we need to subtract 3 from the initial number.
   So, 34 - 3 = 31

3. After giving away 3 coloring books, Faye bought 48 more. To find the total number of coloring books she has now, we need to add 48 to the result from step 2.
   So, 31 + 48 = 79

Therefore, the total number of coloring books Faye would have is 79.

To find the total number of apples the school cafeteria would have, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the initial number of apples the cafeteria had.
The cafeteria initially had 23 apples.

Step 2: Calculate the number of apples left after using 20 to make lunch.
Apples used: 20
Apples left: 23 - 20 = 3

Step 3: Determine the number of new apples the cafeteria bought.
The cafeteria bought 6 more apples.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of apples the cafeteria would have after buying more apples.
Apples left: 3
New apples bought: 6
Total apples: 3 + 6 = 9

Therefore, the school cafeteria would have 9 apples.

To find the total points earned, we need to first determine the number of enemies defeated, and then multiply that by the points earned per enemy.

Step 1: Determine the number of enemies defeated.
The total number of enemies in the level is 11, and you destroy all but 3 of them. This means you defeat 11 - 3 = 8 enemies.

Step 2: Calculate the total points earned.
Each enemy defeated gives you 9 points. To find the total points earned, we multiply the number of enemies defeated by the points earned per enemy: 8 enemies * 9 points/enemy.

Step 3: Perform the multiplication.
8 * 9 = 72

Therefore, the total points earned would be 72.

To find out how many points Megan would have earned, we need to calculate the total points she would have earned if she recycled all 14 bags, and then subtract the points she didn't earn from recycling 5 bags.

Step 1: Calculate the total points Megan would have earned if she recycled all 14 bags.
She earns 8 points for each bag. So, if she recycled all 14 bags, she would earn:
8 points/bag * 14 bags = 112 points

Step 2: Calculate the points Megan didn't earn from recycling 5 bags.
She earns 8 points for each bag. So, if she didn't recycle 5 bags, she would have missed out on:
8 points/bag * 5 bags = 40 points

Step 3: Subtract the points Megan didn't earn from the total points she would have earned.
Total points she would have earned: 112 points
Points she didn't earn: 40 points
Points she actually earned: 112 points - 40 points = 72 points

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many roses April sold and then multiply that number by the price of each rose.

Step 1: Find out how many roses April sold.
April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left. To find out how many roses she sold, we subtract the number of roses left from the number of roses she started with.
13 (initial roses) - 4 (roses left) = 9 roses sold

Step 2: Multiply the number of roses sold by the price of each rose.
The price of each rose is $4. We multiply this by the number of roses sold (9).
9 (roses sold) * $4 (price per rose) = $36

Step 3: Determine the total amount of money earned.
The total amount of money earned is the product of the number of roses sold and the price of each rose.
$36

Step 1: Determine the total number of shirts Ned had to wash.
Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts.
Total shirts = short sleeve shirts + long sleeve shirts
Total shirts = 9 + 21
Total shirts = 30

Step 2: Identify the number of shirts Ned had washed by the time school started.
Ned had washed 29 shirts by the time school started.

Step 3: Calculate the number of shirts Ned did not wash.
To find the number of shirts Ned did not wash, we need to subtract the number of shirts he had washed from the total number of shirts he had to wash.
Number of shirts not washed = Total shirts - Number of shirts washed
Number of shirts not washed = 30 - 29

                     Tom had 5 books. If he sold 4 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Tom have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Tom earned from selling 4 books. Since the price of each book is not given, we will assume that the price of each book is the same.

However, the problem does not explicitly state the price of each book, so we will have to make an assumption. Let's assume that the price of each book is $1 (this is a common assumption when the price is not given).

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Tom earned from selling 4 books.

Tom sold 4 books at $1 each, so the total amount of money he earned is:
4 books * $1/book = $4

Step 3: Calculate the number of new books Tom can buy with the money he earned.

Tom has $4 to buy new books, and each new book costs $1. So, he can buy:
$4 / $1/book = 4 books

Step 4: Calculate the total number of books Tom has after buying 38 new books.

Tom initially had 5 books and sold 4, so he had 5 - 4 = 1 book left.
Then, he bought 38 new books. So, the total number of books he has now is:
1 book + 38 books = 39 books

However, the problem asks us to consider the money he earned from selling 4 books. So, we should also add the 4 books he sold to the total number of books he has now.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of books Tom has after buying 38 new books and considering the 4 books he sold.

Tom initially had 5 books and sold 4, so he had 5 - 4 = 1 book left.
Then, he bought 38 new books. So, the total number of books he has now is:
1 book + 38 books = 39 books
Adding the 4 books he sold, the total number of books he has now is:
39 books + 4 books = 43 books

Therefore, the final answer is 43 books, but we are also asked to include the 4 books he sold, which is an error in the question. The correct interpretation would be to include the 4 books he sold as the 4 books that he sold and the 38 books he bought.<|eot_id|>",39

To determine the number of shelves Jerry would fill up, we need to calculate the total number of sodas and then divide it by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sodas.
Total number of regular sodas = 41
Total number of diet sodas = 22
Total number of sodas = 41 + 22 = 63

Step 2: Divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.
Number of sodas that can fit on each shelf = 9
Number of shelves filled = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas that can fit on each shelf
= 63 / 9
= 7

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, and the question does not specify if we can fill the shelves partially, we can round up or down. In this case, since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we will round up to the nearest whole number.

Since 7 shelves can be filled completely with 63 sodas, and the next shelf would require 8 more sodas to fill it, and we have 63, we can fill the 7 shelves completely.

- Debby had 32 pieces of candy.
- Her sister had 42 pieces of candy.
- Total candies = 32 + 42 = 74

Step 2: Calculate the number of candies they ate on the first night.
- They ate 35 pieces of candy on the first night.

Step 3: Calculate the number of candies they have left.
- To find the number of candies left, we need to subtract the number of candies eaten from the total number of candies.
- Candies left = Total candies - Candies eaten
- Candies left = 74 - 35
- Candies left = 39

Therefore, after eating 35 pieces of candy on the first night, Debby and her sister have 39 pieces of candy left.

To find out how many small gardens Emily had, we need to first calculate how many seeds she used in the small gardens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of seeds Emily used in the small gardens.
She started with 41 seeds and planted 29 of them in the big garden. So, the remaining seeds she used in the small gardens are:
41 (initial seeds) - 29 (seeds planted in the big garden) = 12 seeds

Step 2: Determine how many small gardens Emily had.
Since Emily put 4 seeds in each small garden, we can divide the total seeds used in the small gardens (12) by the number of seeds used in each small garden (4) to find the number of small gardens.
12 seeds / 4 seeds per small garden = 3 small gardens

Therefore, Emily had 3 small gardens.

- She received 13 pieces from her older sister.
Total pieces = 5 + 13 = 18

Step 2: Calculate how many days the candy will last.
- Emily eats 9 pieces per day.
- To find out how many days the candy will last, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day.
Days the candy will last = Total pieces / Pieces eaten per day
= 18 / 9

Step 3: Perform the division.
18 / 9 = 2

Therefore, the candy will last Emily 2 days.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are a total of 82 books that need to be put away.
2. A librarian takes 10 books, leaving Mike with the rest. To find out how many books Mike has, we subtract the number of books taken from the total:
   82 (total books) - 10 (books taken) = 72
3. Mike has 72 books left to put away.
4. Mike can fit 9 books on a shelf. To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books he has by the number of books that can fit on a shelf:
   72 (books Mike has) ÷ 9 (books per shelf) = 8
5. Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if necessary. In this case, Mike can fit all the books on 8 shelves.

                    question:
                     A new building needed 14 windows. The builder had already installed 8 of them. If it takes 8 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Step 1: Determine the number of windows left to be installed.
The builder initially needed 14 windows and had already installed 8. 
So, the number of windows left to be installed is 14 - 8 = 6.

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to install one window.
It takes 8 hours to install each window.

Step 3: Calculate the time it will take to install the remaining windows.
Since it takes 8 hours to install one window, it will take 6 times 8 hours to install the remaining 6 windows.
So, the total time is 6 * 8 = 48 hours.

To find the total number of oranges in the bin, we need to consider the initial number of oranges, the number of oranges thrown away, and the number of new oranges added.

Step 1: Determine the initial number of oranges in the bin.
The store initially had 40 oranges in the bin.

Step 2: Calculate the number of oranges left after throwing away the old ones.
The store threw away 25 oranges, so we subtract 25 from the initial number of oranges:
40 (initial oranges) - 25 (oranges thrown away) = 15 oranges left

Step 3: Calculate the total number of oranges in the bin after adding the new ones.
The store added 21 new oranges to the bin, so we add 21 to the number of oranges left:
15 (oranges left) + 21 (new oranges added) = 36 oranges

Therefore, after throwing away the old ones and adding the new ones, there are 36 oranges in the bin.

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of customers who left a tip.
We know that the waiter had 7 customers and 5 of them didn't leave a tip. So, the number of customers who left a tip is:
7 (total customers) - 5 (customers who didn't leave a tip) = 2 customers

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money earned from the customers who left a tip.
Since each of the customers who left a tip gave $3, we can find the total amount of money earned by multiplying the number of customers who left a tip by the amount each gave:
2 (customers who left a tip) * $3 (amount each gave) = $6

Step 3: Determine the total amount of money earned.
The total amount of money earned is equal to the amount earned from the customers who left a tip:
$6

Therefore, the waiter earned $6.

To find the total number of pieces of candy Faye has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Faye initially scored 47 pieces of candy. 

2. She ate 25 pieces of candy the first night, so we need to subtract 25 from 47 to find out how many pieces she has left after eating:
   47 - 25 = 22

3. After eating 25 pieces, her sister gave her 40 more pieces. We need to add 40 to 22 to find the total number of pieces Faye has now:
   22 + 40 = 62

Therefore, Faye has 62 pieces of candy now.

To solve this problem, we need to find out the total number of chicken wings available and then divide it by the number of friends to determine how many each person will get.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of chicken wings available.
The chef initially had 9 chicken wings cooked, and then cooked 7 more. So, the total number of chicken wings available is:
9 (initial chicken wings) + 7 (additional chicken wings) = 16

Step 2: Divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends to determine how many each person will get.
There are 4 friends, and we want to divide the total number of chicken wings (16) by 4.
16 (total chicken wings) ÷ 4 (number of friends) = 4

Therefore, each person will get 4 chicken wings.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John earns 8 dollars for each lawn he mows. 
   To find out how much he earns in total, we need to multiply the amount he earns per lawn (8 dollars) by the number of lawns he mows.

2. However, John forgot to mow 7 of the 15 lawns. So, he only mowed 15 - 7 = 8 lawns.

3. Since John mowed 8 lawns, we multiply the number of lawns he mowed (8) by the amount he earns per lawn (8 dollars).

   8 lawns * 8 dollars/lawn = 64 dollars

4. Therefore, John earned a total of 64 dollars.

The builder needs 9 windows in total, but has already installed 6. To find the number of windows left, we subtract the number installed from the total number needed:
9 (total windows) - 6 (windows installed) = 3 windows left

**Step 2: Determine the time it takes to install one window.**
It takes 6 hours to install each window.

**Step 3: Calculate the total time needed to install the remaining windows.**
Since it takes 6 hours to install one window, and there are 3 windows left to install, we multiply the time it takes to install one window by the number of windows left:
6 hours/window * 3 windows = 18 hours

79 (total pictures) - 44 (pictures in the first album) = 35

Step 2: Determine the number of pictures that were put into the remaining 5 albums.
Since Wendy put the rest of the pictures (35) into 5 different albums, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

Step 3: Divide the total number of pictures in the remaining albums by the number of albums.
35 (pictures in the remaining albums) ÷ 5 (number of albums) = 7

Step 4: Determine the number of pictures in each album, including the first album.
The first album has 44 pictures. The remaining albums have 7 pictures each.

Step 5: To ensure that we have the correct number of pictures, let's verify the total number of pictures in the remaining albums.
5 (number of albums) * 7 (pictures in each album) = 35

Since the total number of pictures in the remaining albums matches the number of pictures that were not put into the first album (35), we can confirm that our calculation is correct.

To find out how much money Victor made in those two days, we need to calculate his total earnings for each day and then add them together.

**Step 1: Calculate Victor's earnings for Monday**

Victor made 6 dollars an hour and worked 5 hours on Monday.
To find his earnings for Monday, we multiply the number of hours he worked by his hourly wage:
5 hours * 6 dollars/hour = 30 dollars

**Step 2: Calculate Victor's earnings for Tuesday**

Victor made 6 dollars an hour and worked 5 hours on Tuesday.
To find his earnings for Tuesday, we multiply the number of hours he worked by his hourly wage:
5 hours * 6 dollars/hour = 30 dollars

**Step 3: Add Victor's earnings for Monday and Tuesday**

To find Victor's total earnings for the two days, we add his earnings for Monday and Tuesday:

                     Megan baked 71 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 43 of them how many packages could she make if she put 7 cupcake in each package?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find out how many packages Megan can make, we need to first determine how many cupcakes she has left after Todd ate some. 

Step 1: Calculate the number of cupcakes Megan has left.
Megan started with 71 cupcakes and Todd ate 43. To find out how many cupcakes are left, we subtract 43 from 71.
71 - 43 = 28 cupcakes left

Step 2: Determine how many packages Megan can make with the remaining cupcakes.
Since each package contains 7 cupcakes, we need to divide the number of cupcakes left by 7 to find out how many packages Megan can make.
28 ÷ 7 = 4

However, since 28 is not exactly divisible by 7, we need to check if there are any cupcakes left over after filling the last package.
To do this, we can multiply the number of packages by 7 and compare it to the number of cupcakes left.
4 * 7 = 28

Since 28 equals the number of cupcakes left, there are no cupcakes left over. Megan can fill the last package completely.

Step 3: Confirm the number of packages Megan can make.
Based on the calculation, Megan can make 4 packages of cupcakes.

Sam initially had 10 socks.

Step 2: Calculate the number of socks after throwing away 3 old ones.
Since Sam threw away 3 old socks, we need to subtract 3 from the initial number of socks:
10 - 3 = 7

Step 3: Calculate the total number of socks after buying 36 new ones.
To find the total number of socks, we need to add the number of socks Sam had after throwing away the old ones (7) to the number of new socks he bought (36):
7 + 36 = 43

Therefore, Sam would have 43 socks.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of books Adam had after selling 19 books.
Adam initially had 48 books. After selling 19 books, he would have:
48 - 19 = 29 books

Step 2: Calculate the number of books Adam bought with the money he earned from selling 19 books.
Adam sold 19 books and used the money to buy new books. The number of new books he bought is given as 38.

Step 3: Add the number of books Adam had left after selling 19 books to the number of new books he bought.
To find the total number of books Adam would have, we need to add the number of books he had left (29) to the number of new books he bought (38).

To find out how many trips Luke will make, we need to calculate the total number of trays he has to pick up and then divide that by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of trays Luke has to pick up.
Total trays = trays from the first table + trays from the second table
Total trays = 20 + 16
Total trays = 36

Step 2: Calculate the number of trips Luke will make.
Since Luke can carry 4 trays at a time, we need to divide the total number of trays by 4 to find out how many trips he will make.
Number of trips = Total trays / 4
However, since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if there are any remaining trays.

Step 3: Calculate the number of trips Luke will make.
First, divide the total number of trays by 4.
36 / 4 = 9
Since there are no remaining trays, Luke will make exactly 9 trips.

However, we need to consider that the 9 trips will be made from the first table and the second table separately.

Step 4: Calculate the number of trips from each table.
Trays from the first table = 20
Number of trips from the first table = 20 / 4
Number of trips from the first table = 5

Trays from the second table = 16
Number of trips from the second table = 16 / 4
Number of trips from the second table = 4

Step 5: Calculate the total number of trips.
Total number of trips = Number of trips from the first table + Number of trips from the second table
Total number of trips = 5 + 4
Total number of trips = 9

But since Luke can't just make 9 trips to the two tables without picking up the trays from the tables, the total number of trips will be the sum of the trips from each table.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of apples left after handing out 42 to students.

Initial number of apples = 96
Number of apples handed out = 42
Number of apples left = Initial number of apples - Number of apples handed out
= 96 - 42
= 54

Step 2: Determine how many pies can be made with the remaining apples.

Number of apples left = 54
Number of apples per pie = 6
Number of pies = Number of apples left / Number of apples per pie
= 54 / 6
= 9

Step 3: Verify the result to ensure it makes sense in the context of the problem.

Since 9 pies can be made with 54 apples (6 apples per pie), and there are no other constraints or limitations mentioned, this solution seems reasonable.

Number of action figures needed = 8
Number of action figures Henry has = 3

Number of action figures Henry still needs = 8 - 3 = 5

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the action figures Henry still needs.
Each action figure costs $6. To find the total cost of the 5 action figures Henry still needs, we multiply the cost of one action figure by the number of action figures he still needs.

Cost of one action figure = $6
Number of action figures Henry still needs = 5

Total cost = Cost of one action figure * Number of action figures Henry still needs
Total cost = $6 * 5
Total cost = $30

Step 3: Determine the total amount of money Henry needs to finish his collection.
The total cost of the action figures Henry still needs is $30.

To find out how many 8 dollar toys Frank can buy, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he has. 

Step 1: Frank initially had 3 dollars.
Step 2: He received another 37 dollars for his allowance.
Step 3: To find the total amount of money, we need to add the initial amount and the allowance. 
Total money = 3 dollars + 37 dollars = 40 dollars

Now that we know Frank has 40 dollars, we need to find out how many 8 dollar toys he can buy.

Step 4: We need to divide the total amount of money by the cost of each toy to find out how many toys Frank can buy.
Number of toys = Total money / Cost of each toy
= 40 dollars / 8 dollars

Step 1: Determine the total number of carrots picked by Vanessa and her mom.
To find the total number of carrots, we need to add the number of carrots picked by Vanessa (17) and her mom (14).
17 (Vanessa's carrots) + 14 (mom's carrots) = 31

Step 2: Determine the number of good carrots.
We are given that only 24 of the carrots were good.

Step 3: Determine the number of bad carrots.
Since we know the total number of carrots (31) and the number of good carrots (24), we can find the number of bad carrots by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots.
31 (total carrots) - 24 (good carrots) = 7

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of flour Tiffany used for the 8 brownies she baked.
Since Tiffany used 8 cups of flour on each brownie and she baked 8 brownies, the total amount of flour she used is:
8 cups/brownie * 8 brownies = 64 cups

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of flour needed for 17 brownies.
Since Tiffany needs 17 brownies and each brownie requires 8 cups of flour, the total amount of flour needed is:
8 cups/brownie * 17 brownies = 136 cups

Step 3: Calculate the amount of flour Tiffany still needs.
To find out how much flour Tiffany still needs, we need to subtract the amount of flour she used from the total amount of flour needed:
Total amount of flour needed - Total amount of flour used = 136 cups - 64 cups = 72 cups

Therefore, Tiffany still needs 72 cups of flour.

To find the number of bad carrots, we need to determine the total number of carrots picked by Carol and her mom, and then subtract the number of good carrots from it.

Step 1: Find the total number of carrots picked by Carol and her mom.
Carol picked 29 carrots, and her mom picked 16 carrots. 
So, the total number of carrots picked is 29 + 16 = 45.

Step 2: Subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots.
We know that only 38 carrots were good. 
So, the number of bad carrots is 45 - 38 = 7.

To find out how many more problems the teacher has to grade, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of problems on all the worksheets.
Since there are 7 problems on each worksheet and there are 17 worksheets, we multiply 7 by 17 to find the total number of problems.
7 * 17 = 119

Step 2: Determine the number of problems the teacher has already graded.
Since the teacher had already graded 8 worksheets, we multiply the number of problems on one worksheet (7) by the number of worksheets already graded (8) to find the total number of problems already graded.
7 * 8 = 56

Step 3: Calculate the number of problems the teacher still needs to grade.
To find the number of problems the teacher still needs to grade, we subtract the number of problems already graded from the total number of problems on all the worksheets.
119 - 56 = 63

Step 4: Since each worksheet has 7 problems, we need to find out how many worksheets the teacher has to grade.
We already know the teacher has 9 worksheets left to grade (17 - 8 = 9) and each has 7 problems, so we multiply the number of worksheets left to grade by the number of problems on each worksheet.
9 * 7 = 63

Step 5: Therefore, the teacher has 63 more problems to grade.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the initial number of players and the number of lives each player has.
There were initially 8 friends playing the game, and each player had 6 lives.

Step 2: Calculate the initial total number of lives.
To find the initial total number of lives, we multiply the number of players by the number of lives each player has:
8 players * 6 lives/player = 48 lives

Step 3: Determine the number of new players who joined the game.
2 more players joined the game.

Step 4: Calculate the number of lives the new players have.
Each new player also has 6 lives:
2 players * 6 lives/player = 12 lives

Step 5: Calculate the total number of players after the new players joined.
Add the initial number of players to the new players:
8 players + 2 players = 10 players

Step 6: Calculate the total number of lives after the new players joined.

78 - 30 = 48

Step 3: Determine the number of candies in each pile.
Each pile has 8 candies.

Step 4: Calculate the number of piles Bianca can make with the remaining candies.
To find the number of piles, we divide the number of remaining candies by the number of candies in each pile:

The group has 11 people, and 2 of them are kids. So, the number of adults is 11 - 2 = 9.

Step 2: Calculate the cost for the adults.
Each adult meal costs $8, and there are 9 adults. So, the cost for the adults is 8 * 9 = $72.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the group.

2. He sold 21 books, so we need to subtract 21 from 25 to find out how many books he has left after selling:
   25 - 21 = 4

3. Now, Roger used the money he earned from selling 21 books to buy 30 new books. The number of books he has left (4) does not change because the new books are bought with the money earned, not with the existing books.

4. Therefore, Roger now has the 4 books he had left after selling, plus the 30 new books he bought:
   4 (remaining books) + 30 (new books) = 34

   He sold 19 games, so the number of games left is:
   39 - 19 = 20 games

2. **Determine the number of games that can fit in one box:**
   Each box can hold 4 games.

3. **Calculate the number of boxes needed to pack the remaining games:**
   To find the number of boxes, divide the number of games left by the number of games per box:
   20 games / 4 games per box = 5 boxes

4. **Since the number of boxes must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a box), the result is rounded up if necessary. However, in this case, the result is already a whole number.**

Therefore, Luke had to use **5 boxes**.

                    question:
                     There are 65 students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 17 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 8 groups, how many students would be in each group?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find out how many students would be in each group, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of students who got picked for the team.
We know that 17 students didn't get picked, so the number of students who got picked is the total number of students minus the number of students who didn't get picked.
Students who got picked = Total students - Students who didn't get picked
= 65 - 17
= 48

Step 2: Calculate the number of students in each group.
We know that the rest of the students (48) were put into 8 groups, so to find out how many students are in each group, we divide the number of students by the number of groups.
Students per group = Students who got picked / Number of groups
= 48 / 8
= 6

Step 3: Confirm the result.
Since 6 students can be evenly divided into 8 groups, each group will have 6 students.

                    question:
                     Isabel uploaded 25 pictures to Facebook. She put 10 pics into one album and put the rest into 5 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to first determine how many pictures are left after Isabel puts 10 pictures into one album.

Step 1: Subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures.
25 (total pictures) - 10 (pictures in the first album) = 15

Step 2: Since Isabel puts the rest of the pictures into 5 different albums, we need to divide the remaining pictures by the number of albums.
15 (remaining pictures) ÷ 5 (number of albums) = 3

So, each album, excluding the first one with 10 pictures, will have 3 pictures.

To find the total number of pictures in the 5 albums, including the first one with 10 pictures, we add the number of pictures in the first album to the total number of pictures in the other 4 albums.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pictures in the other 4 albums.
3 (pictures in each album) * 4 (number of albums) = 12

Step 4: Add the number of pictures in the first album to the total number of pictures in the other 4 albums.
10 (pictures in the first album) + 12 (pictures in the other 4 albums) = 22

However, we know that the total number of pictures is 25. So, we need to add the remaining 3 pictures to the 22 pictures we calculated.

Step 5: Add the remaining 3 pictures to the 22 pictures we calculated.
22 (pictures in the other 4 albums) + 3 (remaining pictures) = 25

We now know that the first album has 10 pictures and the other 4 albums have 3 pictures each.

Total earnings = 14 + 26 = 40 dollars

Step 2: Determine the amount Mike spends each week
Mike spends 5 dollars a week.

Step 3: Calculate how long Mike's money will last
To find out how long Mike's money will last, we need to divide the total earnings by the amount spent each week.

Total number of shirts = number of short sleeve shirts + number of long sleeve shirts
Total number of shirts = 9 + 27
Total number of shirts = 36

Step 2: Since Dave had only washed 20 shirts by the time school started, we need to subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts to find the number of shirts he did not wash.
Number of shirts not washed = Total number of shirts - number of shirts washed
Number of shirts not washed = 36 - 20

To find the time it will take the chef to cook the rest of the potatoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of potatoes left to cook**: The chef has already cooked 7 potatoes and needs to cook 9 in total. 

   Number of potatoes left = Total potatoes - Potatoes already cooked
   Number of potatoes left = 9 - 7
   Number of potatoes left = 2

2. **Calculate the time it will take to cook the remaining potatoes**: Each potato takes 3 minutes to cook.

   Time to cook the remaining potatoes = Number of potatoes left * Time to cook each potato
   Time to cook the remaining potatoes = 2 * 3
   Time to cook the remaining potatoes = 6

3. **Determine the total time it will take to cook the rest of the potatoes**:

- Pictures taken at the zoo: 41
- Pictures taken at the museum: 29
Total pictures taken = Pictures taken at the zoo + Pictures taken at the museum
Total pictures taken = 41 + 29
Total pictures taken = 70

Step 2: Subtract the number of pictures Gwen deleted from the total number of pictures taken.
- Total pictures taken: 70

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of clothing left after filling the first load:
   Total pieces of clothing = 59
   Pieces of clothing in the first load = 32
   Remaining pieces of clothing = Total pieces of clothing - Pieces of clothing in the first load
   Remaining pieces of clothing = 59 - 32
   Remaining pieces of clothing = 27

2. Since the remaining pieces of clothing are to be split into 9 equal loads, we need to divide the remaining pieces of clothing by 9:
   Pieces of clothing per small load = Remaining pieces of clothing / Number of small loads
   Pieces of clothing per small load = 27 / 9

                     Kaleb had 12 dollars. If he spent 8 bucks on a new game, how many 2 dollar toys could he buy with the money he had left?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Kaleb spent on the new game.
Kaleb spent 8 dollars on a new game.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Kaleb has left after buying the game.
He initially had 12 dollars. After spending 8 dollars, he has:
12 - 8 = 4 dollars left.

Step 3: Determine how many 2-dollar toys Kaleb can buy with the money he has left.
Since each toy costs 2 dollars, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each toy:
4 ÷ 2 = 2 toys.

Therefore, Kaleb can buy 2 toys with the money he has left.

                    question:
                     Jerry made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 31 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 5 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find out how long the money would last Jerry, we need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract his weekly expenses.

Step 1: Calculate Jerry's total earnings.
Jerry made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 31 dollars weed eating.
Total earnings = 14 + 31 = 45 dollars

Step 2: Calculate how much money Jerry has left after spending 5 dollars a week.
Weekly expenses = 5 dollars
Since we don't know the number of weeks, let's represent it as 'x'. 
Total weekly expenses = 5 * x
Total earnings = 45
Money left after x weeks = Total earnings - Total weekly expenses
Money left after x weeks = 45 - (5 * x)

Step 3: Determine how long the money would last Jerry.
We need to find the value of 'x' when the money left after 'x' weeks is equal to or less than 0.
45 - (5 * x) ≤ 0

Step 4: Solve the inequality.
To solve the inequality, we need to isolate 'x'.
5 * x ≤ 45
x ≤ 45 / 5
x ≤ 9

Since 'x' represents the number of weeks, it should be a whole number. Therefore, the money would last Jerry 9 weeks or less.

- So, the total number of quarters = 5 piles * 3 quarters/pile = 15 quarters.

Step 2: Calculate the number of dimes.
- Luke has 5 piles of dimes.
- Each pile has 3 dimes.
- So, the total number of dimes = 5 piles * 3 dimes/pile = 15 dimes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. George initially had $30. 

2. He received $16 as a birthday gift. To find the total amount of money he has after receiving the gift, we need to add $16 to $30.
   $30 + $16 = $46

3. Then, George spent $38 on a new game. To find the final amount of money he has, we need to subtract $38 from $46.
   $46 - $38 = $8

Therefore, George now has $8.

To find out how many pieces Kaleb still had, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of boxes Kaleb had initially.
Kaleb bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy. So, he had 14 boxes initially.

Step 2: Calculate the number of boxes Kaleb gave away.
Kaleb gave 5 boxes to his little brother.

Step 3: Calculate the number of boxes Kaleb still had.
To find the number of boxes Kaleb still had, we need to subtract the number of boxes he gave away from the total number of boxes he had initially.
Number of boxes Kaleb still had = Total number of boxes initially - Number of boxes given away
= 14 - 5
= 9

Step 4: Calculate the total number of pieces in the boxes Kaleb still had.
Each box has 6 pieces inside it, and Kaleb still had 9 boxes.
Total number of pieces = Number of boxes still had * Number of pieces in each box

To find out how many baggies Maria can make, we need to determine the total number of cookies she has and then divide that number by the number of cookies that can fit in one baggie.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies Maria has.
Maria has 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies. To find the total number of cookies, we add these two numbers together:
Total cookies = 5 + 19 = 24

Step 2: Determine the number of cookies that can fit in one baggie.
Since each baggie contains 8 cookies, we don't need to calculate anything here.

Step 3: Divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per baggie.
To find out how many baggies Maria can make, we divide the total number of cookies (24) by the number of cookies per baggie (8):
Number of baggies = Total cookies / Cookies per baggie
= 24 / 8
= 3

Step 4: Consider any remaining cookies.
Since 24 (total cookies) is not exactly divisible by 8 (cookies per baggie), we need to check if there are any remaining cookies. We can do this by finding the remainder of the division:
24 / 8 = 3 with a remainder of 0
This means that Maria can make 3 full baggies without any remaining cookies.

Therefore, Maria can make 3 baggies of cookies.

Step 1: Calculate the number of tickets Tom had left after spending 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth.
Tom had 40 tickets initially. After spending 28 tickets, he had 40 - 28 = 12 tickets left.

Step 2: Determine how many rides Tom could go on with the remaining tickets.
Each ride costs 4 tickets. To find out how many rides Tom could go on, we need to divide the number of tickets he has left (12) by the number of tickets each ride costs (4).

Step 3: Perform the division to find the number of rides Tom could go on.
12 tickets / 4 tickets per ride = 3 rides

Step 4: Confirm that Tom could indeed go on the calculated number of rides with the tickets he had left.

                     While shopping, Maria bought 35 green towels and 21 white towels. If she gave her mother 34 of them, how many towels did Maria end up with?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find out how many towels Maria ended up with, we need to calculate the total number of towels she initially bought and then subtract the number of towels she gave to her mother.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of towels Maria initially bought.
- Number of green towels: 35
- Number of white towels: 21
Total number of towels = Number of green towels + Number of white towels
Total number of towels = 35 + 21
Total number of towels = 56

Step 2: Subtract the number of towels Maria gave to her mother from the total number of towels.
- Total number of towels: 56
- Number of towels given to mother: 34
Number of towels left = Total number of towels - Number of towels given to mother
Number of towels left = 56 - 34
Number of towels left = 22

Therefore, Maria ended up with 22 towels.

To find Adam's final score, we need to calculate the total points he earned from both halves of the game.

Step 1: Calculate the points Adam earned in the first half.
Adam answered 8 questions correct in the first half. Each question was worth 8 points. So, the points he earned in the first half are:
8 questions * 8 points per question = 8 * 8 = 64 points

Step 2: Calculate the points Adam earned in the second half.
Adam answered 2 questions correct in the second half. Each question was worth 8 points. So, the points he earned in the second half are:
2 questions * 8 points per question = 2 * 8 = 16 points

Step 3: Calculate Adam's final score by adding the points from both halves.
Final score = points in the first half + points in the second half
= 64 points + 16 points

To find the total points earned, we need to calculate the points earned by Bianca and her friends separately and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the points earned by Bianca.
Bianca recycled 24 pounds. Since she earns one point for every 3 pounds recycled, we divide 24 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pounds she has.
24 / 3 = 8

Since Bianca earns one point for every 3 pounds, she earns 8 points for recycling 24 pounds.

Step 2: Calculate the points earned by Bianca's friends.
Bianca's friends recycled 3 pounds. We divide 3 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pounds they have.
3 / 3 = 1

Since Bianca's friends earn one point for every 3 pounds, they earn 1 point for recycling 3 pounds.

Step 3: Add the points earned by Bianca and her friends.
Points earned by Bianca: 8
Points earned by Bianca's friends: 1
Total points earned = 8 + 1 = 9

To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of chicken wings available**
The chef initially had 8 chicken wings cooked and then cooked 10 more for the group. To find the total number of chicken wings available, we will add these two numbers together.

8 (initial chicken wings) + 10 (additional chicken wings) = 18

**Step 2: Determine the total number of friends**
We know that there are 3 friends in the group.

**Step 3: Divide the total number of chicken wings by the total number of friends**
To find out how many chicken wings each person will get, we will divide the total number of chicken wings by the total number of friends.

18 (total chicken wings) ÷ 3 (total friends) = 6

**Step 4: Interpret the result**
Since we divided the total number of chicken wings by the total number of friends, the result is the number of chicken wings each person will get.

Total number of players = 2 (new players) + 6 (returning players) = 8 players

Step 2: Divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.
Number of players in each group = 4
Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time the painter needs to paint all 6 rooms:
   Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the total time required to paint 6 rooms is 6 * 5 = 30 hours.

2. Calculate the time the painter has already spent painting 2 rooms:
   Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the time spent painting 2 rooms is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

3. Calculate the time the painter still needs to paint the remaining 4 rooms:
   Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the time needed to paint 4 rooms is 4 * 5 = 20 hours.

4. Calculate the time the painter still needs to paint the remaining 4 rooms, considering he has already spent 10 hours:
   The time the painter still needs to paint the remaining 4 rooms is 20 hours.

5. Calculate how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest:

                    question:
                     A waiter had 22 customers in his section. If 14 of them left and the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table, how many tables did he have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of customers who remained after 14 customers left.
The waiter initially had 22 customers. After 14 customers left, the number of customers remaining is:
22 - 14 = 8

Step 2: Determine the number of tables with 4 people at each table.
We know that the remaining customers (8) were distributed across tables with 4 people at each table. To find the number of tables, we need to divide the number of remaining customers by the number of people per table.
8 / 4 = 2

Since the problem states that the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table, it implies that the tables with 4 people at each table are the remaining tables after the initial 14 customers left. Therefore, the number of tables is equal to the number of remaining customers divided by the number of people per table.

Step 3: Consider the initial 14 customers who left.
The problem states that the waiter initially had 22 customers. The 14 customers who left may have been distributed across tables with 4 people at each table, but the problem does not provide this information. We can assume that the 14 customers may have been distributed across multiple tables, but the problem does not require us to calculate this.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of tables.
Based on the information provided, we can conclude that the number of tables is equal to the number of remaining customers divided by the number of people per table. Since the remaining customers (8) are distributed across tables with 4 people at each table, the number of tables is 2.

However, since the problem does not provide information about the initial distribution of the 14 customers who left, we cannot calculate the total number of tables accurately. We can only calculate the number of tables that had 4 people at each table, which is 2.

Since the problem asks for the total number of tables, we need to consider the possibility that the 14 customers who left may have been distributed across additional tables. However, the problem does not provide this information.

To provide a complete answer, we can assume that the 14 customers who left may have been distributed across additional tables, but the problem does not require us to calculate this. Therefore, the number of tables with 4 people at each table is 2, but the total number of tables may be higher.

However, since the problem is asking for the number of tables he had, and it is implied that the tables with 4 people at each table are the remaining tables after the initial 14 customers left, we can assume that the number of tables is 2.

Roger had 120 pieces of clothing and put 48 in the first load. So, the number of pieces of clothing left is:
120 - 48 = 72

Step 2: Since Roger decided to split the rest into 9 equal loads, we need to divide the remaining number of pieces of clothing (72) by 9 to find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads.

   Since there are 14 books in total and the librarian takes 2, we subtract 2 from 14:
   14 - 2 = 12

2. Since Roger can fit 3 books on a shelf, we need to divide the total number of books he has (12) by the number of books he can fit on a shelf (3) to find the number of shelves he will need.
   We perform this division:

                     While on vacation, Haley took 50 pictures at the zoo and 8 at the museum. If she later deleted 38 of the pictures, how many pictures from her vacation did she still have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find out how many pictures Haley still has, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pictures taken by Haley.
Haley took 50 pictures at the zoo and 8 at the museum. 
Total pictures taken = 50 (at the zoo) + 8 (at the museum) = 58

Step 2: Calculate the number of pictures Haley deleted.
Haley deleted 38 pictures.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pictures Haley still has.
To find out the number of pictures Haley still has, we need to subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures taken.
Pictures still have = Total pictures taken - Number of deleted pictures
= 58 - 38
= 20

To find the total number of roses the florist has, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: The florist initially had 5 roses.

Step 2: She sold 3 roses, so we need to subtract 3 from the initial number of roses to find out how many she had left.
5 (initial roses) - 3 (roses sold) = 2

Step 3: After selling 3 roses, she picked 34 more. To find the total number of roses now, we need to add the number of roses she picked to the number of roses she had left after selling some.
2 (roses left after selling) + 34 (roses picked) = 36

Therefore, the florist now has 36 roses.

To determine the number of shelves Cody would fill up, we need to find the total number of sodas he bought and then divide that number by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sodas Cody bought.
Total number of sodas = Number of regular sodas + Number of diet sodas
Total number of sodas = 4 + 44
Total number of sodas = 48

Step 2: Determine the number of shelves Cody would fill up by dividing the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.
Number of shelves = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
Number of shelves = 48 / 6

To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to calculate the total number of apples ordered and subtract the number of apples given to the students.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of apples ordered.
The cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples. 
So, the total number of apples ordered is 6 + 15 = 21 apples.

Step 2: Calculate the number of apples given to the students.
Only 5 students wanted fruit, and we assume they each got one fruit. 
So, the number of apples given to the students is 5 apples.

Step 3: Calculate the number of extra apples the cafeteria ended up with.
To find the number of extra apples, we subtract the number of apples given to the students from the total number of apples ordered.
Extra apples = Total apples ordered - Apples given to students
Extra apples = 21 - 5
Extra apples = 16

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Mike had left after buying new mower blades.
Mike initially had 42 dollars. He spent 10 dollars on mower blades. 
To find out how much money he had left, we subtract the cost of mower blades from his initial amount:
42 - 10 = 32 dollars

Step 2: Determine the number of 8 dollar games Mike can buy with the money he has left.
We need to divide the amount of money Mike has left (32 dollars) by the cost of each game (8 dollars) to find out how many games he can buy.
32 / 8 = 4

Step 3: Since the number of games is a whole number, Mike can buy 4 games with the money he has left.

To find out how much Vanessa spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the flowers she bought.

3 roses * 8 dollars/rose = 24 dollars

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the daisies.
Since each daisy also costs 8 dollars, and Vanessa bought 3 daisies, we multiply the cost of one daisy by the number of daisies:
3 daisies * 8 dollars/daisy = 24 dollars

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the flowers.
To find the total cost, we add the cost of the roses and the cost of the daisies:
24 dollars (roses) + 24 dollars (daisies) = 48 dollars

Total trays = trays from the first table + trays from the second table
Total trays = 9 + 7
Total trays = 16

Step 2: Determine the number of trays Jerry can carry in one trip.
Number of trays per trip = 8

Step 3: Calculate the number of trips Jerry will make.
Number of trips = Total trays / Number of trays per trip
Since Jerry can't make a fraction of a trip, we need to round up if there's any remainder.
Number of trips = 16 / 8
Number of trips = 2

However, Jerry still needs to pick up 16 trays and he can only carry 8 at a time. This means he will make 2 trips, but on the second trip, he will only need to pick up 8 trays. 

Step 4: Check if there are any remaining trays after the first two trips.
Remaining trays = Total trays - (Number of trays per trip * 2)
Remaining trays = 16 - (8 * 2)
Remaining trays = 16 - 16
Remaining trays = 0

Since there are no remaining trays, Jerry will indeed make 2 trips.

                    question:
                     Faye was playing a video game where she scores 7 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 2 treasures on the first level and 6 on the second, what would her score be?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find Faye's score, we need to calculate the total points she earned from the treasures she found on both levels.

Step 1: Calculate the points Faye earned from the first level.
- Faye found 2 treasures on the first level.
- Each treasure is worth 7 points.
- So, the points from the first level = 2 treasures * 7 points/treasure = 14 points.

Step 2: Calculate the points Faye earned from the second level.
- Faye found 6 treasures on the second level.
- Each treasure is worth 7 points.
- So, the points from the second level = 6 treasures * 7 points/treasure = 42 points.

Step 3: Calculate the total points Faye earned from both levels.
- Total points = points from the first level + points from the second level
- Total points = 14 points + 42 points = 56 points.

Therefore, Faye's score would be 56 points.

19 - 4 = 15

Step 3: The next day, Megan picked 46 more carrots.

Step 4: To find the total number of carrots Megan has now, we need to add the carrots she picked the next day (46) to the carrots she had left after throwing out 4 (15).
15 + 46 = 61

Step 5: Therefore, the total number of carrots Megan would have is 61.

To find out how many folders Wendy ended up with, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of files Wendy had left after deleting 37 files.
We know that Wendy had 82 files initially. After deleting 37 files, she has:
82 - 37 = 45 files left

Step 2: Determine the number of files in each folder.
We know that each folder contains 5 files.

Step 3: Calculate the number of folders Wendy ended up with.
To find out how many folders Wendy ended up with, we need to divide the number of files she has left by the number of files in each folder:
45 files / 5 files per folder = 9 folders

Since we cannot have a fraction of a folder, we can ignore any remainder, as the folders are assumed to be whole.

Initial amount of money = $104
Amount spent on mower blades = $41

Money left = Initial amount of money - Amount spent on mower blades
Money left = $104 - $41
Money left = $63

Step 2: Determine how many 9 dollar games Will can buy with the money he had left.

Number of games = Money left / Cost of each game
Number of games = $63 / $9

To find the number of games, we need to divide $63 by $9.

Step 3: Perform the division.

$63 ÷ $9 = 7

So, Will can buy 7 games with the money he had left.

We start with this amount.

Step 2: Roger received 28 more dollars as a birthday gift. 
To find the total amount after receiving the gift, we add 16 (initial amount) and 28 (gift).
16 + 28 = 44

Step 3: Roger spent 25 dollars on a new game. 
To find the final amount, we need to subtract the amount spent (25) from the total amount after receiving the gift (44).
44 - 25 = 19

Step 4: Determine the final amount of money Roger has now. 
After the subtraction in step 3, we have the final amount.

To find out how many more problems the teacher has to grade, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of problems on all the worksheets.
Since there are 4 problems on each worksheet and the teacher has 16 worksheets, we multiply the number of worksheets by the number of problems on each worksheet.

16 worksheets * 4 problems per worksheet = 64 problems

Step 2: Determine the number of problems the teacher has already graded.
Since the teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, we multiply the number of worksheets graded by the number of problems on each worksheet.

8 worksheets * 4 problems per worksheet = 32 problems

Step 3: Calculate the number of problems the teacher still has to grade.
To find this, we subtract the number of problems already graded from the total number of problems on all the worksheets.

64 total problems - 32 problems already graded = 32 problems

Step 4: Determine the number of worksheets the teacher still has to grade.
Since the teacher has already graded 8 worksheets and there are 16 worksheets in total, we subtract the number of worksheets already graded from the total number of worksheets.

16 total worksheets - 8 worksheets already graded = 8 worksheets

Step 5: Calculate the number of problems the teacher has to grade from the remaining worksheets.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the number of potatoes left to cook.
The chef has already cooked 6 potatoes out of 12. To find the number of potatoes left, we subtract the number of cooked potatoes from the total number of potatoes.

12 (total potatoes) - 6 (cooked potatoes) = 6 potatoes left

Step 2: Determine the time it takes to cook one potato.
Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

Step 3: Calculate the time it will take to cook the remaining potatoes.
Since there are 6 potatoes left and each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, we multiply the number of potatoes left by the time it takes to cook one potato.

6 (potatoes left) * 6 (minutes per potato) = 36 minutes

Step 4: Conclusion
It will take the chef 36 minutes to cook the remaining 6 potatoes.

To find out how much Emily spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the flowers she bought. 

Step 1: Identify the cost of each flower.
The cost of each flower is 3 dollars.

Step 2: Determine the number of each type of flower Emily bought.
Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies.

Step 3: Since the cost of each flower is the same, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the cost of one flower by the total number of flowers.
However, since roses and daisies are different types of flowers, we need to calculate the total cost for each type and then add them together.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of roses.
2 roses * 3 dollars/rose = 6 dollars

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of daisies.
2 daisies * 3 dollars/daisy = 6 dollars

                    question:
                     At the town carnival Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times and the bumper cars 4 times. If each ride cost 7 tickets, how many tickets did he use?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find out how many tickets Oliver used, we need to calculate the total number of tickets used for the ferris wheel and the bumper cars, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tickets used for the ferris wheel.
- The ferris wheel was ridden 5 times.
- Each ride costs 7 tickets.
- Total tickets used for the ferris wheel = Number of rides * Cost per ride
- Total tickets used for the ferris wheel = 5 * 7
- Total tickets used for the ferris wheel = 35

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tickets used for the bumper cars.
- The bumper cars were ridden 4 times.
- Each ride costs 7 tickets.
- Total tickets used for the bumper cars = Number of rides * Cost per ride
- Total tickets used for the bumper cars = 4 * 7
- Total tickets used for the bumper cars = 28

Step 3: Add the total tickets used for the ferris wheel and the bumper cars to find the overall number of tickets used.
- Total tickets used = Total tickets used for the ferris wheel + Total tickets used for the bumper cars
- Total tickets used = 35 + 28
- Total tickets used = 63

Wendy bought 4 new chairs and 4 new tables. 
Total number of pieces of furniture = 4 (chairs) + 4 (tables) = 8

Step 2: Calculate the total time spent putting together each piece of furniture.
Wendy spent 6 minutes on each piece of furniture.
Total time spent on each piece of furniture = 6 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent putting together all the furniture.
Since there are 8 pieces of furniture and Wendy spent 6 minutes on each piece, 
Total time spent = 8 * 6 minutes = 48 minutes

To find the number of good games Ned ended up with, we need to first find the total number of games he bought, and then subtract the number of games that didn't work.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of games Ned bought.
- Ned bought 50 games from a friend.
- He bought 27 more games at a garage sale.
Total number of games = 50 + 27 = 77

Step 2: Calculate the number of good games by subtracting the number of games that didn't work from the total number of games.
- Total number of games = 77
- Number of games that didn't work = 74
Number of good games = Total number of games - Number of games that didn't work
= 77 - 74

To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of boxes Dave has after giving 5 boxes to his little brother.

Dave initially had 12 boxes. He gave 5 boxes to his brother, so the number of boxes he has left is:
12 - 5 = 7

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pieces in the 7 boxes Dave has left.

Each box contains 3 pieces of chocolate candy. Since Dave has 7 boxes, the total number of pieces he has is:
7 * 3 = 21

Step 3: Since we have the total number of pieces, this is our answer.

To find out how many customers left a tip, we need to first determine the total number of customers the waiter had to wait on. 

Step 1: Calculate the total number of customers the waiter had to wait on initially.
Total customers initially = 39

Step 2: Calculate the total number of customers the waiter had to wait on after adding 12 more during the lunch rush.
Total customers after lunch rush = 39 + 12 = 51

Step 3: Since we are interested in finding out how many customers left a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers.
Number of customers who didn't leave a tip = 49

Step 4: To find the number of customers who left a tip, we subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers.
Number of customers who left a tip = Total customers after lunch rush - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
= 51 - 49

Step 2: Calculate the number of apples left after they used 13 to make lunch for the students.
Apples left = Initial number of apples - Number of apples used
Apples left = 14 - 13
Apples left = 1

Step 3: Calculate the total number of apples after they bought 49 more.
Total number of apples = Apples left + Number of apples bought
Total number of apples = 1 + 49
Total number of apples = 50

Cost of decks Frank bought = Number of decks Frank bought * Cost per deck
Cost of decks Frank bought = 3 * 7
Cost of decks Frank bought = 21 dollars

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the decks Frank's friend bought.
Frank's friend bought 2 decks at 7 dollars each.
Cost of decks Frank's friend bought = Number of decks Frank's friend bought * Cost per deck
Cost of decks Frank's friend bought = 2 * 7
Cost of decks Frank's friend bought = 14 dollars

Step 3: Add the costs of the decks Frank and his friend bought to find the total amount spent.
