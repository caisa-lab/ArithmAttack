                    question:
                     Paige ; had 11 songs on? her mp3 player.. If she deleted 9, old, songs? from it and then, added 8 new songs, how many songs does she, have on! her mp3! player?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Step 1: Paige initially had 11 songs on her mp3 player.

Step 2: She deleted 9 old songs from her mp3 player. To find out how many songs she has left, we need to subtract the number of songs deleted from the initial number of songs.

11 (initial songs) - 9 (deleted songs) = 2

Step 3: After deleting 9 songs, Paige is left with 2 songs on her mp3 player.

Step 4: Then, she added 8 new songs to her mp3 player. To find the total number of songs now, we need to add the new songs to the remaining songs.

2 (remaining songs) + 8 (new songs) = 10

Step 5: Therefore, Paige now has 10 songs on her mp3 player.

                    question:
                     There were! 39 girls and? 4 boys trying ; out ; for the schools? basketball team. If only ; 26 of : them got called! back, how many students didn't! make the cut?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Understand the given information.
There are 39 girls and an unknown number of boys trying out for the basketball team.

Step 2: Identify the given information about the number of students who got called back.
Only 26 students got called back.

Step 3: Recognize that the total number of students trying out is the sum of girls and boys.
Let's denote the number of boys as x. The total number of students is 39 (girls) + x (boys).

Step 4: Understand that the number of students who got called back is a subset of the total number of students trying out.
The 26 students who got called back are a part of the total number of students trying out.

Step 5: Set up an equation based on the given information about the number of students who got called back.
Since 26 students got called back, and they are a part of the total number of students trying out, we can set up an equation:

39 (girls) + x (boys) ≥ 26 (students who got called back)

However, we are given that there were! 39 girls and? 4 boys trying out for the basketball team, which implies that the number of boys is 4. 

Step 6: Substitute the given number of boys into the equation.
39 (girls) + 4 (boys) ≥ 26 (students who got called back)

Step 7: Simplify the equation.
43 ≥ 26

Step 8: Since the total number of students trying out is 43 (39 girls + 4 boys), we can calculate the number of students who didn't make the cut.
The number of students who didn't make the cut is the difference between the total number of students trying out and the number of students who got called back.

43 (total number of students trying out) - 26 (students who got called back) = 17

Therefore, the number of students who didn't make the cut is 17.

To find the total number of coloring books Faye has, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Subtract the number of books Faye gave away from the initial number of books she had.
Faye had 34 coloring books and gave away 3, so we subtract 3 from 34:
34 - 3 = 31

Step 2: Add the number of new coloring books Faye bought to the result from Step 1.
Faye bought 48 more coloring books, so we add 48 to the result from Step 1:
31 + 48 = 79

Therefore, after giving away 3 coloring books and buying 48 more, Faye would have a total of 79 coloring books.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The school cafeteria initially has 23 apples.

Step 2: They used 20 apples to make lunch for the students. To find out how many apples they have left after using 20 apples, we need to subtract 20 from 23.

23 - 20 = 3

So, after using 20 apples, they have 3 apples left.

Step 3: Then, they bought 6 more apples. To find the total number of apples they have now, we need to add 6 to the remaining 3 apples.

3 + 6 = 9

Therefore, the school cafeteria now has 9 apples.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the problem**: We need to calculate the total points earned from defeating enemies in a level.

2. **Identifying the information**: Each enemy defeated gives 9 points, and there are a total of 11 enemies in the level.

3. **Calculating the points earned from defeating 8 enemies**:
   Since you destroy all but 3 of the 11 enemies, you defeat 11 - 3 = 8 enemies.
   To find the points earned from defeating 8 enemies, multiply the number of enemies defeated by the points earned per enemy:
   8 enemies * 9 points/enemy = 72 points

4. **Considering the 3 remaining enemies**: The problem doesn't specify the points earned from defeating the remaining 3 enemies. Since the question implies that you destroy all but 3 of the enemies, it's likely that the remaining 3 enemies are not defeated. However, to be thorough, let's consider the points earned from defeating the 3 remaining enemies:
   3 enemies * 9 points/enemy = 27 points

5. **Calculating the total points earned**: To find the total points earned, add the points earned from defeating 8 enemies and the points earned from defeating the 3 remaining enemies:
   72 points + 27 points = 99 points

6. **Final answer**: Since we've calculated the total points earned, we can conclude:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of bags Megan had. 
She had 14 bags, but didn't recycle 5 of them. 
So, the number of bags she recycled = 14 - 5 = 9 bags.

Step 2: Determine the points earned per bag. 
She earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled.

Step 3: Calculate the total points earned by multiplying the points earned per bag by the number of bags she recycled. 
Total points earned = points earned per bag * number of bags recycled
Total points earned = 8 * 9
Total points earned = 72

Therefore, Megan would have earned 72 points.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of roses April had.
April started with 13 roses.

Step 2: Determine the number of roses April sold.
April had 4 roses left after the sale. To find the number of roses she sold, we subtract the number of roses left from the initial number of roses.
Number of roses sold = Initial number of roses - Number of roses left
= 13 - 4
= 9

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money April earned from selling the roses.
Each rose was sold for $4. To find the total amount of money earned, we multiply the number of roses sold by the price of each rose.
Total money earned = Number of roses sold * Price of each rose
= 9 * $4
= $36

Step 4: Conclude the final amount of money April earned.
Based on the previous step, we can conclude that April earned $36.

Total shirts = 9 + 21 = 30

Step 2: Identify the number of shirts Ned washed before school started.
Ned washed 29 shirts before school started.

Step 3: Find out how many shirts Ned did not wash.
To find the number of shirts Ned did not wash, we need to subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of people who actually attended the luncheon and then divide that number by the number of people each table can hold.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who attended the luncheon.
The company invited 47 people, but 7 of them didn't show up. So, the number of people who attended is:
47 (total invited) - 7 (didn't show up) = 40

Step 2: Determine the number of tables needed.
Each table can hold 5 people. To find the number of tables needed, we divide the number of people who attended by the number of people each table can hold:
40 (people who attended) / 5 (people per table) = 8

Therefore, the company needs 8 tables.

To solve this problem, we'll follow the steps below:

1. **Initial Condition**: Tom had 5 books initially.
2. **Action 1**: He sold 4 books. This means he has 5 - 4 = 1 book left after selling.
3. **Action 2**: He used the money from selling 4 books to buy new books. Since the problem doesn't mention the price of the books, we'll assume the price is not relevant to the problem. What's important is the number of books he bought.
4. **Action 3**: He bought 38 new books.

Now, to find the total number of books Tom has, we add the number of books he had left after selling (1) to the number of new books he bought (38).

1 (book left after selling) + 38 (new books bought) = 39

So, after buying 38 new books, Tom has a total of 39 books.

   41 (total seeds) - 29 (seeds in the big garden) = 12 seeds

2. We also know that Emily planted 4 seeds in each of her small gardens. To find the number of small gardens, we need to divide the total number of seeds planted in the small gardens by the number of seeds planted in each small garden:
   Number of small gardens = Total seeds in small gardens / Seeds in each small garden
   Number of small gardens = 12 / 4

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days the candy will last Emily. 

Step 1: First, let's find out how many pieces of candy Emily received in total. 
She received 5 pieces from her neighbors and 13 pieces from her sister. 
Total pieces = 5 + 13 = 18 pieces.

Step 2: Now, let's find out how many days the candy will last her. 
She ate 9 pieces a day. 
To find out how many days the candy will last, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces she ate per day. 
Days the candy will last = Total pieces / Pieces eaten per day = 18 / 9

Step 3: To divide 18 by 9, we can use long division or simply divide the numbers. 
18 / 9 = 2

Step 4: Since we are looking for the number of days the candy will last, we can conclude that the candy will last Emily 2 days.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of books left after the librarian takes 10 books.
- Initial number of books = 82
- Number of books taken by the librarian = 10
- Number of books left = Initial number of books - Number of books taken
- Number of books left = 82 - 10
- Number of books left = 72

Step 2: Determine how many shelves Mike needs to put away the remaining books.
- Number of books left = 72
- Number of books that can fit on a shelf = 9
- Number of shelves needed = Number of books left / Number of books that can fit on a shelf
- Number of shelves needed = 72 / 9

To divide 72 by 9, we can simplify the division by dividing the numbers 72 and 9 by their greatest common divisor, which is 9.

- 72 / 9 = 8

Step 3: Confirm the number of shelves needed.
- Number of shelves needed = 8

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pictures Nancy took during her vacation.
Total pictures taken = pictures at the zoo + pictures at the museum
Total pictures taken = 49 + 8
Total pictures taken = 57

Step 2: Calculate the number of pictures Nancy deleted.
Pictures deleted = 38

Step 3: Calculate the number of pictures Nancy still has.
Pictures remaining = Total pictures taken - Pictures deleted
Pictures remaining = 57 - 38
Pictures remaining = 19

Therefore, {The final answer is 19}.<|eot_id|>",19

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of windows left to be installed.
The builder needed 14 windows and had already installed 8 of them. 
To find the number of windows left, subtract the number already installed from the total number needed:
14 (total windows needed) - 8 (windows already installed) = 6

Step 2: Determine the time it takes to install one window.
It takes 8 hours to install each window.

Step 3: Calculate the time it will take to install the remaining windows.
Since it takes 8 hours to install one window, to find the time it will take to install 6 windows, multiply the time it takes to install one window by the number of windows left:
8 hours/window * 6 windows = 48 hours

Step 4: Conclude the final answer.
Based on the steps above, it will take the builder 48 hours to install the rest of the windows.

2. Subtract the number of old oranges thrown away from the initial number: 40 - 25 = 15

3. Add the number of new oranges added to the result from step 2: 15 + 21 = 36

Therefore, the number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 25 old ones and adding 21 new ones is 36.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of customers who left a tip.
Since 5 customers didn't leave a tip, we subtract this from the total number of customers to find the number who did leave a tip.
Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
= 7 - 5
= 2

Step 2: Calculate the total amount earned from the customers who left a tip.
Since the waiter got $3 each from the ones who did tip, we multiply the number of customers who left a tip by the amount they each paid.
Total amount earned = Number of customers who left a tip * Amount each paid
= 2 * $3
= $6

Step 3: Determine the total amount earned by the waiter.
Since the waiter only earned money from the customers who left a tip, the total amount earned is the same as the amount earned from those customers.
Total amount earned = $6

Faye scored 47 pieces of candy.

Step 2: Calculate how many pieces of candy Faye ate.
Faye ate 25 pieces of candy.

Step 3: Calculate how many pieces of candy Faye had after eating some.
To do this, we subtract the number of pieces eaten from the initial number of pieces scored.
Pieces after eating = Initial pieces - Pieces eaten
= 47 - 25
= 22

Step 4: Calculate how many pieces of candy Faye has after her sister gave her more.
Faye's sister gave her 40 more pieces of candy.
So, we add the number of pieces given to the number of pieces Faye had after eating.
Pieces now = Pieces after eating + Pieces given
= 22 + 40
= 62

Therefore, Faye now has 62 pieces of candy {The final answer is}.<|eot_id|>",62

To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of chicken wings available.
The chef already had 9 cooked chicken wings and cooked 7 more for the group.
Total chicken wings = 9 (initial) + 7 (additional) = 16

Step 2: Calculate the number of chicken wings each person will get.
There are 4 friends in the group, and they will each get the same amount.
To find the number of wings each person will get, we divide the total number of wings by the number of friends.
Number of wings per person = Total chicken wings / Number of friends
= 16 / 4
= 4

Step 3: Determine the final answer.
Based on the calculation, each person will get 4 chicken wings.

To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of puppies in the shelter.

Step 1: Calculate the initial number of puppies in the shelter.
The shelter initially had 5 puppies.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of puppies after 35 more were brought in.
Total number of puppies = initial number of puppies + number of puppies brought in
= 5 + 35
= 40

Step 3: Calculate the number of days it would take to adopt all the puppies.
We know that 8 puppies are adopted each day. To find out how many days it would take to adopt all the puppies, we need to divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted each day.

Number of days = total number of puppies / number of puppies adopted each day
= 40 / 8
= 5

Therefore, it would take 5 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of windows already installed.
The builder has already installed 6 windows.

Step 2: Determine the number of windows left to install.
The total number of windows needed is 9, and 6 are already installed. 
To find the number of windows left to install, subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed:
9 (total windows) - 6 (windows already installed) = 3

Step 3: Determine the time it takes to install each window.
It takes 6 hours to install each window.

Step 4: Calculate the time it will take to install the remaining windows.
Since it takes 6 hours to install each window, and there are 3 windows left to install, multiply the time it takes to install one window by the number of windows left to install:
6 hours/window * 3 windows = 18 hours

Step 5: Determine the total time it will take to install all the windows.
Since the builder has already installed 6 windows, which would take 6 hours/window * 6 windows = 36 hours, and it will take 18 hours to install the remaining 3 windows, add the two times together:
36 hours + 18 hours = 54 hours

However, the question asks for the time it will take to install the rest of the windows, not the total time. Therefore, the answer is the time it will take to install the remaining 3 windows:

Remaining worksheets = 34 - 7
Remaining worksheets = 27

Step 4: Understand the new situation
Another 36 worksheets were turned in.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of worksheets the teacher needs to grade

To find the total cost for the group to eat, we need to calculate the cost of the adult meals and then add it to the cost of any remaining adult meals (if any). However, since the problem statement is unclear, I will assume it means that 13 people came in and 9 of them were kids.

Step 1: Determine the number of adults in the group.
Since there are 13 people in the group and 9 of them are kids, the number of adults can be found by subtracting the number of kids from the total number of people:
13 (total people) - 9 (kids) = 4 adults

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the adult meals.
Since each adult meal costs $7 and there are 4 adults, the total cost of the adult meals can be found by multiplying the cost per adult meal by the number of adults:
$7 (cost per adult meal) * 4 (adults) = $28

Step 3: Determine if there are any remaining adult meals to consider.
Since all adults are accounted for in the group, there are no remaining adult meals to consider.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for the group to eat.
Since kids eat free, the cost of the kids' meals is $0. The total cost for the group to eat is the cost of the adult meals:

To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many math and science problems Paige had in total. Then, we'll subtract the number of problems she finished from the total to find out how many problems she has left to do.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of math and science problems Paige had.
Math problems: 43
Science problems: 12
Total problems: 43 + 12 = 55

Step 2: Subtract the number of problems Paige finished from the total to find out how many problems she has left to do.
Number of problems Paige finished: 44
Number of problems Paige has left to do: 55 - 44 = 11

However, the problem statement has an error in it. It says ""If she finished 44 of ; the problems at school,"" which implies that Paige finished 44 problems in total, but it also says ""how many problems did? she, have? to do for homework?"" which implies that there are still math and science problems to do. Since Paige finished 44 problems, it should be a combination of math and science problems. 

Since the total number of problems is 55 and she finished 44 problems, it means she finished 44 math and science problems, but the actual number of math and science problems finished should be 44 because it is not specified that she finished all the math and science problems. However, to find the number of math and science problems left to do, we need to know how many math and science problems she finished.

Step 3: Let's assume that Paige finished x math problems and 44 - x science problems.
Since she finished 44 problems in total, we can set up an equation:
x + (44 - x) = 44
Simplifying the equation:
44 - x = 44
x = 0
This means that Paige finished 0 math problems and 44 science problems.

Step 4: Now, let's find out how many math and science problems Paige has left to do.
Number of math problems Paige has left to do: 43 - 0 = 43
Number of science problems Paige has left to do: 12 - 44 is incorrect because the number of science problems finished is 44 - x and x = 0, so 44 - x = 44. However, it is given that there are 12 science problems. Therefore, the number of science problems Paige has left to do is 12.

However, the question is asking for the total number of problems she has left to do, not the number of math and science problems separately.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of problems Paige has left to do.
Number of math problems Paige has left to do: 43
Number of science problems Paige has left to do: 12
Total number of problems Paige has left to do: 43 + 12 = 55

However, this is incorrect because it is given that she finished 44 problems. So the total number of problems she has left to do is 55 - 44 = 11.

But the question is asking for the total number of problems she has left to do for homework. Since the total number of problems is 55 and she finished 44 problems, it means she finished 44 math and science problems, but the actual number of math and science problems finished should be 44 because it is not specified that she finished all the math and science problems. However, to find the number of math and science problems left to do, we need to know how many math and science problems she finished.

Since the question is asking for the total number of problems she has left to do for homework, we can simply subtract the number of problems she finished from the total number of problems.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of problems Paige has left to do for homework.
Total number of problems: 55
Number of problems Paige finished: 44
Number of problems Paige has left to do for homework: 55 - 44 = 11

However, the problem statement has an error in it. It says ""If she finished 44 of ; the problems at school,"" which implies that Paige finished 44 problems in total, but it also says ""how many problems did? she, have? to do for homework?"" which implies that there are still math and science problems to do.

So, the points from the first level = 5 * 9 = 45 points.

Step 2: Calculate the points Rachel earned from the second level.
She found 2 treasures on the second level and scores 9 points for each treasure. 
So, the points from the second level = 2 * 9 = 18 points.

Step 3: Calculate the total points Rachel earned from both levels.

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

Step 1: Understand the initial situation
The waiter had 26 customers to wait on initially.

Step 2: Understand the change in the situation
During the lunch rush, the waiter added another 27 customers.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of customers
To find the total number of customers, we need to add the initial number of customers (26) to the number of customers added (27).

Total number of customers = 26 + 27 = 53

Step 4: Understand the condition
27 customers didn't leave a tip.

Step 5: Calculate the number of customers who left a tip
To find the number of customers who left a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip (27) from the total number of customers (53).

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
= 53 - 27
= 26

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The toy store initially had 17 giant stuffed bears in stock.

2. They received another shipment with 10 bears in it. 

   To find the total number of bears they have now, we need to add the initial number of bears to the number of bears in the new shipment:
   Total bears = Initial bears + Bears in new shipment
   Total bears = 17 + 10
   Total bears = 27

3. The store put the bears onto shelves with 9 bears on each shelf.

   To find the number of shelves they used, we need to divide the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf:
   Number of shelves = Total bears / Bears per shelf
   Number of shelves = 27 / 9

4. Now, let's perform the division:
   Number of shelves = 3

Therefore, the toy store used 3 shelves to put the bears.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of shelves for each type of book.
- Gwen has 5 shelves of mystery books.
- Gwen has 3 shelves of picture books.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of mystery books.
- Each shelf has exactly 4 books.
- So, the total number of mystery books is 5 shelves * 4 books/shelf = 20 books.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of picture books.
- Each shelf has exactly 4 books.
- So, the total number of picture books is 3 shelves * 4 books/shelf = 12 books.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of books.
- The total number of books is the sum of mystery books and picture books.
- Total number of books = 20 (mystery books) + 12 (picture books) = 32 books.

To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many pictures are in the rest of the albums, not the one album with 44 pictures. 
   So, we subtract the number of pictures in the one album (44) from the total number of pictures (79).
   79 - 44 = 35

2. Now, we know that 35 pictures are in the rest of the albums. These 35 pictures are divided into 5 different albums.
   To find the number of pictures in each album, we divide the total number of pictures in the rest of the albums (35) by the number of albums (5).
   35 / 5 = 7

So, the number of pictures in each album is 7.

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students and then divide that number by the group size to find out how many groups can be made.

Step 1: Find the total number of students.
The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls.
Total number of students = 5 boys + 40 girls
Total number of students = 45

Step 2: Divide the total number of students by the group size to find the number of groups.
The group size is given as 9.
Number of groups = Total number of students / Group size
Number of groups = 45 / 9

Step 3: Calculate the number of groups.
Number of groups = 5

Therefore, the debate team can make 5 groups of 9 students each.

To find out how much money April earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of roses April sold**: Since April started with 9 roses and had 4 roses left, the number of roses she sold is the difference between the initial number and the remaining number.

   Initial number of roses = 9
   Remaining number of roses = 4
   Number of roses sold = Initial number of roses - Remaining number of roses
   Number of roses sold = 9 - 4
   Number of roses sold = 5

2. **Calculate the total amount earned**: Since each rose was sold for $7, we can find the total amount earned by multiplying the number of roses sold by the price of each rose.

   Price of each rose = $7
   Number of roses sold = 5
   Total amount earned = Price of each rose * Number of roses sold
   Total amount earned = $7 * 5
   Total amount earned = $35

Therefore, April earned $35 from selling the roses.

   11 (total members) - 6 (members who didn't show up) = 5

2. Calculate the total points scored by the members who showed up:
   Each member who showed up scored 9 points. Since there were 5 members who showed up, the total points scored is:
   9 (points per member) * 5 (number of members who showed up) = 45

Victor worked 5 hours on Monday. Since he makes $6 per hour, we multiply 5 hours by $6 per hour.
5 hours * $6 per hour = $30

Step 2: Calculate Victor's earnings for Tuesday.
Victor worked 5 hours on Tuesday. Since he makes $6 per hour, we multiply 5 hours by $6 per hour.
5 hours * $6 per hour = $30

**Step 3: Determine the number of socks Sam bought.**
Sam bought 36 new socks.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of socks Sam has after buying 36 new socks.**

103 - 47 = 56

Step 2: Determine the number of bouquets Wendy can make with the remaining flowers.
Each bouquet requires 8 flowers. To find out how many bouquets Wendy can make, we need to divide the number of remaining flowers by 8:
56 ÷ 8 = 7

However, we need to check if the division results in a whole number. If it does, then Wendy can make that many bouquets. If not, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of books Adam sold.
Since Adam sold 19/10 (or 1 9/10) of his books, we need to multiply 19/10 by the total number of books he had.
19/10 * 48 = (19 * 48) / 10 = 912 / 10 = 91.2

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we will consider it as selling 91 books (rounding down to the nearest whole number).

Step 2: Calculate the money Adam earned from selling the books.
Since Adam sold 91 books out of 48, the number of books he sold is 91/48 of the total.
The price of each book is not given, but we can assume the price of each book is the same.
So, the money Adam earned from selling the books is 91/48 of the total price of the books.

Step 3: Calculate the price of each book.
Let's assume the total price of the books Adam had initially is P.
Then, the price of each book is P/48.
Since Adam sold 91 books, the money he earned from selling the books is 91/48 * P.

Step 4: Calculate the money Adam earned from selling the books.
The money Adam earned from selling the books is 91/48 * P.

Step 5: Calculate the money Adam used to buy new books.
The money Adam used to buy new books is the money he earned from selling the books, which is 91/48 * P.

Step 6: Calculate the price of the new books Adam bought.
Since Adam used the money he earned from selling the books to buy 38 new books, the price of the new books is the money he earned from selling the books divided by 38.
The price of the new books is (91/48 * P) / 38.

Step 7: Calculate the number of new books Adam bought.
Since the price of the new books is (91/48 * P) / 38, and the money Adam earned from selling the books is 91/48 * P, the number of new books Adam bought is (91/48 * P) / 38.

Step 8: Calculate the total number of books Adam has.
The total number of books Adam has is the number of books he sold + the number of new books he bought.
However, this is a bit tricky because the money Adam earned from selling the books is not the same as the total price of the books he sold.
Let's assume the total price of the books Adam had initially is P.
Then, the price of each book is P/48.
The number of books Adam sold is 91/48 of the total, so the money he earned from selling the books is 91/48 * P.
The number of new books Adam bought is (91/48 * P) / 38.
The total price of the new books Adam bought is the price of each new book multiplied by the number of new books, which is (P/48) * (91/48 * P) / 38.
Since the price of each book is P/48, the total price of the books Adam had initially is 48 * (P/48), which is P.
The total price of the new books Adam bought is (P/48) * (91/48 * P) / 38.
The total price of the new books Adam bought is (P/48) * (91/48 * P) / 38.
The total number of books Adam has is the number of books he sold + the number of new books he bought.
The total number of books Adam has is 91 + (91/48 * P) / 38.

However, this is still a bit tricky because we can't directly calculate the total number of books Adam has.
Let's simplify the problem.

Step 1: Calculate the number of books Adam sold.
Since Adam sold 19/10 (or 1 9/10) of his books, we need to multiply 19/10 by the total number of books he had.
19/10 * 48 = (19 * 48) / 10 = 912 / 10 = 91.2

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we will consider it as selling 91 books (rounding down to the nearest whole number).

Step 2: Calculate the money Adam earned from selling the books.
Since Adam sold 91 books out of 48, the number of books he sold is 91/48 of the total.

                    question:
                     : Nancy's : class is going on a field trip to. the zoo.? If each ; van can hold 5 : people and ; there are, 12 students and 3 adults, going, how many vans will they need?,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the number of vans needed, we need to calculate the total number of people going on the trip and then divide that number by the number of people each van can hold.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of people going on the trip.
There are 12 students and 3 adults, so the total number of people is:
12 (students) + 3 (adults) = 15 people

Step 2: Determine the number of vans needed.
Each van can hold 5 people. To find out how many vans are needed, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each van can hold:
15 (total people) ÷ 5 (people per van) = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a van, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if necessary. However, in this case, the division results in a whole number, so we don't need to round up.

                    :  For a birthday! party : Tom bought! 4 regular sodas and : 52 diet. sodas. If? his! fridge would only, hold 7 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find out how many shelves Tom would fill up, we need to first determine the total number of sodas he bought. 

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sodas Tom bought.
Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas.
Total number of sodas = 4 + 52 = 56

Step 2: Determine how many shelves Tom would fill up.
Tom's fridge can hold 7 sodas on each shelf.
To find out how many shelves he would fill up, we need to divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.
Number of shelves = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
Number of shelves = 56 / 7

Step 3: Perform the division.
56 / 7 = 8

However, we need to consider that the division might not be a whole number, which means Tom might not be able to fill up a shelf completely. In this case, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if the remainder is not zero.

Step 4: Check if there's a remainder.
56 / 7 = 8 with a remainder of 0.

Since there's no remainder, we can conclude that Tom would fill up exactly 8 shelves.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The school cafeteria initially had 38 apples.

2. They used 20 apples to make lunch for the students. To find out how many apples they have left, we need to subtract the number of apples used from the initial number of apples:

   38 (initial apples) - 20 (apples used) = 18 apples left

3. After using 20 apples, they bought 28 more. To find out the total number of apples they have now, we need to add the number of apples they bought to the number of apples they had left:

   18 (apples left) + 28 (apples bought) = 46 apples

So, after buying 28 more apples, the school cafeteria would have 46 apples.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of trays Luke needs to pick up and then divide that number by the number of trays he can carry at a time.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of trays Luke needs to pick up.
- From the first table: 20 trays
- From the second table: 16 trays
Total trays = 20 + 16 = 36 trays

Step 2: Determine the number of trays Luke can carry at a time.
Luke can carry 4 trays at a time.

Step 3: Divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Luke can carry at a time.
36 trays / 4 trays per trip = 9 trips

However, since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we need to round up if there's any remainder. In this case, 36 trays / 4 trays per trip = 9 trips with 0 remainder.

Therefore, Luke will make 9 trips.

Apples left = Total apples - Apples handed out
Apples left = 96 - 42
Apples left = 54

Step 2: Determine the number of pies that can be made with the remaining apples.
Since each pie takes 6 apples, we can divide the number of apples left by 6 to find the number of pies.
Number of pies = Apples left / Apples per pie
Number of pies = 54 / 6
Number of pies = 9

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many action figures Henry needs to buy and then multiply that number by the cost of each action figure.

Step 1: Determine the number of action figures Henry needs to buy.
Henry has 3 action figures, but he needs a total of 8 action figures for a complete collection. To find out how many he needs to buy, we subtract the number of action figures he has from the total number he needs:

8 (total needed) - 3 (action figures he has) = 5

So, Henry needs to buy 5 action figures.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the action figures Henry needs to buy.
Each action figure costs $6, and Henry needs to buy 5 action figures. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of action figures he needs to buy by the cost of each action figure:

5 (number of action figures) * $6 (cost of each action figure) = $30

Therefore, Henry would need $30 to finish his collection.

He received 37 dollars for his allowance.

Step 2: Add the money Frank had saved up to the money he received for his allowance.
Frank had saved up 3 dollars. 
So, the total amount of money Frank has is 3 + 37 = 40 dollars.

Step 3: Determine the cost of each toy.
The cost of each toy is 8 dollars.

Step 4: Divide the total amount of money Frank has by the cost of each toy to find the number of toys he can buy.

Step 2:  The total number of carrots picked is 17 + 14 = 31.

Step 3:  We're told that only 24 of the carrots were good, so to find the number of bad carrots, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked.

To find the total number of people, we need to add the number of managers and employees:
   Total people = 23 (managers) + 7 (employees)
   Total people = 30

2. Now, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of teams (6) to find out how many people will be on each team:
   People per team = Total people / Number of teams
   People per team = 30 / 6

3. To divide 30 by 6, we can use a calculator or do the division manually:

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine how much flour Tiffany used in total.
Tiffany baked 8 brownies and used 8 cups of flour for each one. 
So, the total amount of flour she used is 8 brownies * 8 cups/brownie = 64 cups.

Step 2: Calculate how much flour Tiffany has left.
Since Tiffany needed 17 brownies in total, and she already baked 8, she still needs 17 - 8 = 9 brownies.
However, the question asks for the amount of flour she still needs, not the number of brownies.

Step 3: Determine how much flour is needed for the remaining brownies.
Since Tiffany needs 9 more brownies and each brownie requires 8 cups of flour, the total flour needed for the remaining brownies is 9 * 8 = 72 cups.

Step 4: Calculate how much flour Tiffany still needs.
Tiffany used 64 cups of flour in total, and she needs 72 cups for the remaining brownies.
So, the amount of flour she still needs is 72 - 64 = 8 cups.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

   Total carrots picked = 29 + 16 = 45

2. Since only 38 of the carrots were good, we can find the number of bad carrots by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked.

   Bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Good carrots
               = 45 - 38

3. Now, let's calculate the number of bad carrots.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of problems on one worksheet.
Since there are 7 problems on one worksheet, we can write this as:
Problems on one worksheet = 7

Step 2: Determine the total number of problems on all worksheets.
The teacher has 17 worksheets, and we know that each worksheet has 7 problems. To find the total number of problems, we multiply the number of worksheets by the number of problems on one worksheet:
Total problems = Number of worksheets * Problems on one worksheet
Total problems = 17 * 7
Total problems = 119

Step 3: Determine the number of problems already graded.
The teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, and we know that each worksheet has 7 problems. To find the total number of problems already graded, we multiply the number of worksheets already graded by the number of problems on one worksheet:
Problems already graded = Number of worksheets already graded * Problems on one worksheet
Problems already graded = 8 * 7
Problems already graded = 56

Step 4: Determine the number of problems left to grade.
To find the number of problems left to grade, we subtract the number of problems already graded from the total number of problems:
Problems left to grade = Total problems - Problems already graded
Problems left to grade = 119 - 56
Problems left to grade = 63

Step 5: Determine the number of worksheets left to grade.
Since each worksheet has 7 problems, we can divide the number of problems left to grade by the number of problems on one worksheet to find the number of worksheets left to grade:
Number of worksheets left to grade = Problems left to grade / Problems on one worksheet
Number of worksheets left to grade = 63 / 7
Number of worksheets left to grade = 9

Step 6: Determine the number of problems left to grade per worksheet.
Since the teacher has 9 worksheets left to grade, and each worksheet has 7 problems, we can divide the number of problems left to grade by the number of worksheets left to grade to find the number of problems left to grade per worksheet:
Problems left to grade per worksheet = Problems left to grade / Number of worksheets left to grade
Problems left to grade per worksheet = 63 / 9
Problems left to grade per worksheet = 7

However, this is not what the question asks. The question asks for the total number of problems left to grade, which is 63.

Step 3: Determine the number of lives each player has.
Each player has 6 lives.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of lives all players have.
Since there are 10 players and each player has 6 lives, we multiply the number of players by the number of lives each player has.

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    ? There were 5 friends playing a. video game online! when 2, more : players joined the game. If! each player had 8 lives, how, many lives. did they, have total?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the initial number of players.
There were 5 friends playing the video game online initially.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of players after 2 more players joined the game.
The initial number of players was 5, and 2 more players joined, so the total number of players is 5 + 2 = 7.

Step 3: Determine the number of lives each player had.
Each player had 8 lives.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of lives the players had.
To find the total number of lives, we multiply the total number of players by the number of lives each player had. Total number of lives = total number of players * number of lives per player = 7 * 8 = 56.

{The final answer is 56.}<|eot_id|>",56

                    ;  ; At, a. restaurant : each adult meal costs $8 and kids eat? free. If, a group of. 11 people came in and 2 ; were kids, how much would it cost for ; the group to eat?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for the adults and the kids separately, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the cost for the adults.
- There are 11 people in total.
- 2 people are kids, so the number of adults is 11 - 2 = 9.
- Each adult meal costs $8.
- The total cost for the adults is 9 * $8 = $72.

Step 2: Calculate the cost for the kids.
- Kids eat for free, so the cost for the kids is $0.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the group.
- The total cost is the sum of the cost for the adults and the kids.
- The total cost is $72 (for adults) + $0 (for kids) = $72.

{The final answer is $72.}<|eot_id|>",72

                    question:
                     Roger? had 25 books.? If he. sold 21 of them and used? the money he earned, to buy 30 new books, how? many books would Roger. have? ;<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we will break it down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the initial number of books Roger had.
Roger had 25 books.

Step 2: Calculate the number of books Roger sold.
Roger sold 21 books.

Step 3: Calculate the number of books Roger has after selling 21 books.
Since he sold 21 books out of 25, we subtract 21 from 25.
25 - 21 = 4
Roger has 4 books left.

Step 4: Understand the relationship between the money earned and the number of new books bought.
The problem implies that the money earned from selling 21 books was used to buy 30 new books.

Step 5: Since the problem does not provide information about the cost of the new books, we assume that the money earned was sufficient to buy 30 new books.
This means that the number of new books bought does not affect the initial calculation of the number of books Roger has after selling 21 books.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of books Roger would have after buying 30 new books.
We add the 4 books left to the 30 new books.
4 + 30 = 34

However, since we are asked to consider the money he earned from selling the books, and then buying new ones, we must consider the context of the question, which is likely to be asking for the number of books he has after buying new ones with the money earned. Thus, the question is likely asking for the number of books he has after buying the new ones.

Step 7: Since the question is asking how many books Roger would have after buying 30 new books with the money he earned, we should consider the money earned from selling 21 books and use it to buy 30 new books. However, the question does not provide the cost of the new books, but we can assume that he used the money he earned from selling 21 books to buy 30 new books.

Step 8: Since the question is not clear on how the money earned was used to buy the books, we will assume that the money earned was used to buy the books, and thus, the number of books he would have is the 30 new books he bought.

However, the question is not clear on how the money earned was used to buy the books, and the cost of the new books is not provided. Therefore, we can only calculate the number of books he has after selling 21 books, which is 4.

The question asks how many books Roger would have if he sold 21 of them and used the money he earned to buy 30 new books. However, the question is not clear on how the money earned was used to buy the books, and the cost of the new books is not provided.

Considering the information given, we can only say that Roger had 4 books after selling 21 books. However, the question seems to be asking for the total number of books he would have after buying 30 new books with the money he earned, but the cost of the new books is not provided.

Since we are assuming that the money earned was used to buy 30 new books, the total number of books Roger would have is 30 + 4 = 34.

However, this is an assumption and not a clear calculation from the question. 

Given the information provided and the ambiguity of the question, we can conclude that Roger had 4 books after selling 21 books, but the question seems to be asking for the total number of books he would have after buying 30 new books with the money he earned.

Considering the information given, we can only say that Roger had 4 books after selling 21 books. However, the question seems to be asking for the total number of books he would have after buying 30 new books with the money he earned.

However, if we are considering the context of the question and the fact that the question is asking for the number of books Roger would have, we should consider the money earned from selling the books and use it to buy 30 new books.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Wendy initially had 10 lives.

Current lives: 10

Step 2: In the hard part of the game, she lost 6 lives.

10 - 6 = 4

Current lives: 4

Step 3: She got 37 more lives in the next level.

4 + 37 = 41

Current lives: 41

Therefore, after getting 37 more lives in the next level, Wendy would have 41 lives.

To find out how many 2-dollar games Frank could buy with the money he had left, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Frank had left after buying the new mower blades.

Frank made $19 and spent $11 on new mower blades. 

So, money left = money made - money spent
Money left = $19 - $11
Money left = $8

Step 2: Determine how many 2-dollar games Frank could buy with the money he had left.

Number of games = money left / cost of each game
Number of games = $8 / $2
Number of games = 4

There are 48 new players and 6 returning players. 
Total players = 48 + 6 = 54

Step 2: Determine the number of players in each group.
Each group has 6 players.

Step 3: Calculate the number of groups.
To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.
Number of groups = Total players / Number of players in each group

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Nancy initially had 80 files on her computer.

2. She deleted 31 of them. To find out how many files she has left, we need to subtract the number of deleted files from the initial number of files:
   80 (initial files) - 31 (deleted files) = 49 files left

3. Now, we know that Nancy put the rest of the files (49) into folders with 7 files in each one. To find out how many folders she ended up with, we need to divide the number of remaining files by the number of files in each folder:
   49 (remaining files) ÷ 7 (files per folder) = 7

Since 7 is a whole number, Nancy can create exactly 7 folders with 7 files in each one.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes Luke had to use. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Luke started with 39 games.
2. He sold 19 games, so to find out how many games he has left, we need to subtract 19 from 39.
   39 - 19 = 20

So, Luke has 20 games left.

3. Luke packed the rest of the games up, putting 4 games into each box. To find out how many boxes he needs, we need to divide the number of games left (20) by the number of games per box (4).
   20 ÷ 4 = 5

Therefore, Luke has to use 5 boxes.

3. If 17 students didn't get picked, that means the number of students who got picked is 65 - 17 = 48.
4. The rest of the students (48) were put into 8 groups.
5. To find out how many students would be in each group, we need to divide the total number of students put into groups (48) by the number of groups (8).

- Earnings from weed eating: $26
- Total earnings: $14 + $26 = $40

Step 2: Calculate how much money Mike has left after subtracting his weekly expenses.
- Weekly expenses: $5
- Total earnings: $40
- Money left after one week: $40 - $5 = $35

Step 3: Determine how many weeks the money will last.
- Money left after one week: $35
- Weekly expenses: $5
- Number of weeks the money will last: $35 / $5 = 7

   9 (total potatoes) - 7 (potatoes already cooked) = 2

   So, there are 2 potatoes left to cook.

2. **Calculate the time it takes to cook one potato**: Each potato takes 3 minutes to cook.

3. **Calculate the time it takes to cook the remaining potatoes**: Since there are 2 potatoes left to cook and each takes 3 minutes, we multiply the number of potatoes by the time it takes to cook one:

   2 (potatoes left) * 3 (minutes per potato) = 6 minutes

   Therefore, it will take the chef 6 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

                    question:
                     A. pet shelter had 2 puppies when another 34. were brought? in. ; If 4 : puppies, a day are adopted,, how long would. it take for all of them to be. adopted?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of puppies in the shelter and then divide it by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of puppies in the shelter.
The shelter initially had 2 puppies, and 34 more were brought in. To find the total number of puppies, we need to add these two numbers together.

Total number of puppies = 2 + 34 = 36

Step 2: Divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.
The shelter adopts 4 puppies per day. To find the number of days it would take to adopt all the puppies, we need to divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Number of days = Total number of puppies / Number of puppies adopted per day
= 36 / 4
= 9

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to first determine how many pieces of clothing are left after putting 32 in one load.

Step 1: Determine the total number of pieces of clothing left after putting 32 in one load.
Total number of pieces of clothing = 59
Number of pieces in one load = 32
Number of pieces left = Total number of pieces of clothing - Number of pieces in one load
Number of pieces left = 59 - 32
Number of pieces left = 27

Step 2: Determine how many small loads Will will be making with the remaining pieces of clothing.
Number of small loads = 9

Step 3: Calculate how many pieces of clothing can go in each of the small loads.
Number of pieces in each load = Number of pieces left / Number of small loads
Number of pieces in each load = 27 / 9
Number of pieces in each load = 3

Adam bought 2 boxes of chocolate candy.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of caramel candy boxes.
Adam bought 5 boxes of caramel candy.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pieces of chocolate candy.
Each box has 4 pieces of candy inside it. So, the total number of pieces of chocolate candy is:
2 (boxes) * 4 (pieces per box) = 8

Step 4: Calculate the total number of pieces of caramel candy.
Each box has 4 pieces of candy inside it. So, the total number of pieces of caramel candy is:
5 (boxes) * 4 (pieces per box) = 20

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of candy Adam bought.

Katie bought 5 roses and 5 daisies, so the total number of flowers is 5 + 5 = 10.

Step 3: Multiply the total number of flowers by the cost of each flower to find the total cost.
Total cost = number of flowers * cost per flower
Total cost = 10 * $6
Total cost = $60

Step 4: Determine the final amount Katie spent.
Since Katie bought 10 flowers at $6 each, she spent $60.

To find the number of new books Victor bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of books Victor bought. The problem mentions 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books. However, it's unclear if the books are for adventure or mystery. Assuming the problem is asking for the total number of books and the exclamation mark (!) is just an error in punctuation, we'll proceed with this assumption.

   Total number of books = 32 (adventure) + 37 (mystery) = 69

2. The problem states that 16 books were used. We need to subtract these from the total number of books to find the number of new books.

   Number of new books = Total number of books - Number of books used
                      = 69 - 16

3. Perform the subtraction.

   Number of new books = 53

However, there is an ambiguity in the problem regarding the exclamation mark (!) and the type of books (adventure or mystery). If the problem is asking for the number of new books of a specific type, we would need more information.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria initially picked 48 carrots from her garden.

2. Then, she threw out 11 of them. To find out how many carrots she has left, we need to subtract the number of carrots she threw out from the initial number of carrots she picked.

   So, 48 (initial carrots) - 11 (carrots thrown out) = 37 carrots left.

3. The next day, Maria picked 15 more carrots. To find the total number of carrots she has now, we need to add the number of carrots she picked the next day to the number of carrots she had left.

   So, 37 (carrots left) + 15 (carrots picked the next day) = 52 carrots.

Therefore, Maria would have a total of 52 carrots.

So, the initial number of lives among the 4 friends is 4 * 3 = 12 lives.

Step 2: Calculate the number of lives among the 5 new players who joined the game.
There are 5 new players and each player has 3 lives. 
So, the number of lives among the 5 new players is 5 * 3 = 15 lives.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of lives among all the players.
To find the total number of lives, we add the initial number of lives among the 4 friends and the number of lives among the 5 new players.

Amount spent on the game = 8 dollars
Amount of money left = Initial amount of money - Amount spent on the game
Amount of money left = 12 - 8
Amount of money left = 4 dollars

Step 2: Determine how many 2-dollar toys Kaleb can buy with the money he has left.

Cost of each toy = 2 dollars
Amount of money left = 4 dollars
Number of toys that can be bought = Amount of money left / Cost of each toy
Number of toys that can be bought = 4 / 2
Number of toys that can be bought = 2

                    question:
                   ,  Adam had 33 books. If he sold 11. of them and used the? money he earned to buy 23 new books,, how? many ; books? would, Adam have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the initial situation
Adam had 33 books initially.

Step 2: Calculate the number of books Adam sold
Adam sold 11/10 of his books. To find the number of books sold, we need to multiply 33 by 11/10.

To do this, we can convert 11/10 to a decimal or a fraction that is easier to work with. In this case, 11/10 can be converted to 1.1 (as a decimal).

Now, multiply 33 by 1.1:
33 * 1.1 = 36.3

So, Adam sold 36.3 books. However, since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we can assume he sold 36 books.

Step 3: Calculate the number of books Adam kept
After selling 36 books, Adam would have 33 - 36 = -3 books left. However, since we can't have a negative number of books, this indicates that Adam sold more books than he had initially. This means the initial statement about selling 11/10 of his books might be incorrect or the question is based on an incorrect premise.

However, to continue with the problem as presented, let's assume that Adam sold 11/10 of his books and still had some books left to buy new ones.

Step 4: Calculate the money Adam earned from selling books
Since we know Adam sold 36 books and each book is assumed to be worth the same amount, we can assume the value of each book is $1 for simplicity. 

36 books * $1/book = $36

Step 5: Calculate the number of new books Adam bought
Adam used the $36 he earned to buy new books. If each book costs $1, he could buy 36 new books.

However, the problem states Adam bought 23 new books.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of books Adam has now
Adam had 33 books initially and sold 36 books. However, he still had some books left after selling 11/10 of his books. Let's assume he had some books left.

After selling 36 books, Adam would have 33 - 36 = -3 books left. However, this is incorrect as we can't have a negative number of books.

Since Adam had some books left after selling 11/10 of his books, let's assume he had x books left. He then sold 36 - x books.

After selling 36 - x books, Adam would have x books left. He then used the money he earned to buy 23 new books.

So, the total number of books Adam has now is x + 23.

However, since the initial premise is incorrect, let's re-evaluate the problem.

Step 7: Re-evaluate the problem
Let's assume the problem is asking how many books Adam would have if he sold 1/10 of his books and used the money he earned to buy new books.

Adam had 33 books initially. If he sold 1/10 of his books, he would sell 33 * 1/10 = 3.3 books.

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we can assume he sold 3 books.

Adam would have 33 - 3 = 30 books left. He used the money he earned to buy 23 new books.

So, the total number of books Adam has now is 30 + 23 = 53 books.

So, the total number of cans = 10 (bags) * 4 (cans per bag) = 40 cans.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cans Kaleb picked up.
The total number of cans is equal to the number of cans in the bags.
So, the total number of cans Kaleb picked up = 40 cans.

To find the total number of books Nancy had, we need to calculate the number of books on the mystery bookshelves and the picture bookshelves separately, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the number of books on the mystery bookshelves.
Nancy had 2 shelves of mystery books, and each shelf had exactly 6 books on it. So, the total number of mystery books is:
2 shelves * 6 books/shelf = 12 mystery books

Step 2: Calculate the number of books on the picture bookshelves.
Nancy had 6 shelves of picture books, and each shelf had exactly 6 books on it. So, the total number of picture books is:
6 shelves * 6 books/shelf = 36 picture books

Step 3: Add the total number of mystery books and picture books to find the overall number of books Nancy had.
Total number of books = 12 mystery books + 36 picture books = 48 books

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Paul initially saved up 3 dollars.

Step 2: He received another 7 dollars for his allowance. To find out how much money he has now, we need to add the allowance to the initial amount:

3 dollars (initial savings) + 7 dollars (allowance) = 10 dollars

Step 3: Now, we need to determine how many 5-dollar toys Paul can buy with 10 dollars. To do this, we will divide the total amount of money he has (10 dollars) by the cost of each toy (5 dollars):

10 dollars ÷ 5 dollars = 2

Step 4: Since we are looking for the number of toys, we can ignore the remainder (which would be 0 in this case). Paul can buy 2 toys.

To find the number of folders Katie ended up with, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of files Katie had left after deleting 40 files.
She initially had 85 files, and she deleted 40 of them. To find the number of files left, we subtract 40 from 85.
85 - 40 = 45

Step 2: Determine the number of files in each folder.
Each folder has 5 files.

Step 3: Calculate the number of folders Katie ended up with.
To find the number of folders, we divide the total number of files left (45) by the number of files in each folder (5).
45 / 5 = 9

Earnings on Monday = 8 hours * $8/hour = $64

Step 2: Calculate Will's earnings for Tuesday.
Will worked 2 hours on Tuesday at $8 per hour.
Earnings on Tuesday = 2 hours * $8/hour = $16

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of the situation described.

Step 1: Carol initially made 19 cupcakes.
We know this from the statement ""Carol made 19 cupcakes.""

Step 2: She sold 6 of them.
This means we need to subtract 6 from the initial number of cupcakes to find out how many were left. 
So, we have 19 - 6 = 13 cupcakes left.

Step 3: Then, she made 27 more cupcakes.
This means we need to add 27 to the number of cupcakes left after selling 6. 
So, we have 13 + 27 = 40 cupcakes.

Therefore, the total number of cupcakes Carol would have is 40.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of members who showed up.
We are given that there were 14 members total and 7 members didn't show up. To find the number of members who showed up, we subtract the number of members who didn't show up from the total number of members.

Number of members who showed up = Total number of members - Number of members who didn't show up
= 14 - 7
= 7

Step 2: Calculate the total number of points scored.
We are given that each member who showed up scored 5 points. To find the total number of points scored, we multiply the number of members who showed up by the number of points each member scored.

Total points scored = Number of members who showed up * Points scored per member
= 7 * 5
= 35

Therefore, the total number of points scored is 35.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of team members who showed up.
The problem states that 2 members didn't show up, so we subtract this number from the total number of members to find the number of members who showed up.
Total members = 5
Members who didn't show up = 2
Members who showed up = Total members - Members who didn't show up
Members who showed up = 5 - 2
Members who showed up = 3

Step 2: Calculate the total number of points scored.
Each member who showed up scored 6 points. To find the total number of points scored, we multiply the number of members who showed up by the number of points each member scored.
Number of members who showed up = 3
Number of points each member scored = 6
Total points scored = Number of members who showed up * Number of points each member scored
Total points scored = 3 * 6
Total points scored = 18

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of books Oliver has to put away.
There are 46 books in total.

Step 2: Identify the number of books the librarian takes.
The librarian takes 10 books.

Step 3: Calculate the number of books Oliver is left with.
To find the number of books Oliver is left with, we subtract the number of books the librarian takes from the total number of books:
46 (total books) - 10 (books taken) = 36 books left with Oliver.

Step 4: Determine the number of shelves Oliver will need.
Since Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf, we need to divide the number of books he has left by 4 to find the number of shelves he will need:
36 (books left) ÷ 4 (books per shelf) = 9.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, and Oliver will be putting 4 books on each shelf, we must round up to the nearest whole number if necessary. In this case, 9 is a whole number.

Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away the books.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know Luke has 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes.
2. Each pile has 3 coins in it. So, for quarters:
   Number of piles of quarters = 5
   Number of coins in each pile of quarters = 3
   Total number of quarters = Number of piles of quarters * Number of coins in each pile of quarters
   Total number of quarters = 5 * 3
   Total number of quarters = 15
3. Similarly, for dimes:
   Number of piles of dimes = 5
   Number of coins in each pile of dimes = 3
   Total number of dimes = Number of piles of dimes * Number of coins in each pile of dimes
   Total number of dimes = 5 * 3
   Total number of dimes = 15
4. Now, to find the total number of coins, we need to add the number of quarters and dimes:
   Total number of coins = Total number of quarters + Total number of dimes
   Total number of coins = 15 + 15
   Total number of coins = 30

5 pounds / 3 pounds per point = 1.666... (round down to 1)

Step 2: Gwen's friends recycled 13 pounds. 
To find out how many points Gwen's friends earned, we need to divide the number of pounds they recycled (13) by 3 and round down to the nearest whole number.

To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pictures Robin uploaded to Facebook.
Robin uploaded 31 pictures from her phone and 5 pictures from her camera. 
Total pictures = 31 + 5 = 36

Step 2: Since Robin sorted the pictures into 9 different albums with the same amount of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by 9.
Number of pictures in each album = Total pictures / 9
= 36 / 9

Step 3: Perform the division to find the number of pictures in each album.
36 / 9 = 4

Therefore, there are 4 pictures in each of the 9 albums.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Mike had left after buying the new mower blades.
   Mike made 69 dollars mowing lawns.
   He spent 24 dollars buying new mower blades.
   So, the amount of money he had left is: 69 - 24 = 45 dollars.

2. Now, we need to find out how many 5-dollar games Mike can buy with the money he had left.
   To do this, we'll divide the amount of money he had left by the cost of each game.
   Number of games = Amount of money left / Cost of each game
   Number of games = 45 / 5
   Number of games = 9

So, Mike can buy 9 games with the money he had left.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of minutes Maria spent putting together the furniture. 

Step 1: Determine the total number of pieces of furniture Maria bought.
Maria bought 2 new chairs and 2 new tables. 
So, the total number of pieces of furniture is 2 (chairs) + 2 (tables) = 4 pieces.

Step 2: Calculate the total time spent putting together the furniture.
Since Maria spent 8 minutes on each piece of furniture, the total time spent is the number of pieces multiplied by the time spent on each piece.
Total time = Number of pieces * Time spent on each piece
Total time = 4 * 8
Total time = 32 minutes

Step 3: Since the question asks how many minutes it took her to finish, we have already calculated this in Step 2.
Therefore, the total time it took Maria to finish putting together the furniture is 32 minutes.

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

Step 1: Identify the total number of pictures taken by Rachel at the zoo and the museum.
Rachel took 6 pictures at the zoo and 9 at the museum. So, the total number of pictures taken is 6 + 9 = 15.

Step 2: Identify the number of pictures deleted by Rachel.
Rachel deleted 11 pictures.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pictures remaining after deletion.
To find the number of pictures remaining, we need to subtract the number of pictures deleted from the total number of pictures taken.
Remaining pictures = Total pictures - Pictures deleted
= 15 - 11
= 4

Step 4: Determine the number of pictures Rachel still has.
Since we calculated the number of pictures remaining after deletion, we can conclude that Rachel still has 4 pictures from her vacation.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Maria has in total and then divide that number by the number of cookies per baggie.

Step 1: Find the total number of cookies Maria has.
Maria has 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies.
Total cookies = 5 + 19 = 24

Step 2: Divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per baggie.
Number of cookies per baggie = 8
Number of baggies = Total cookies / Number of cookies per baggie
= 24 / 8
= 3

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a baggie, we will round down to the nearest whole number.

Step 3: Since we cannot make a fraction of a baggie, we need to check if Maria has enough cookies to make one more baggie.
If Maria has 24 cookies and can make 3 baggies with 8 cookies per baggie, she will have 0 cookies left over (24 - 24 = 0). This means she can make 3 baggies and still have no cookies left over.

However, we need to check if Maria can make one more baggie. To do this, we need to see if she has at least 8 cookies left over after making 3 baggies.
Since Maria has 24 cookies and can make 3 baggies with 8 cookies per baggie, she will have 0 cookies left over. This means she cannot make one more baggie.

Step 4: Determine the final number of baggies Maria can make.
Based on the previous steps, Maria can make 3 baggies.

Number of mystery books = 5 shelves * 8 books/shelf = 40 books

Step 2: Calculate the number of books on the picture book shelves.
Bianca had 4 shelves of picture books, and each shelf had exactly 8 books.
Number of picture books = 4 shelves * 8 books/shelf = 32 books

Step 3: Add the number of mystery books and picture books to find the total number of books.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

She needs 5 total brownies for her party.

Step 2: Determine the number of brownies Isabel already baked.
She baked 3 brownies.

Step 3: Calculate the number of brownies Isabel still needs to bake.
To find this, we subtract the number of brownies she already baked from the total number of brownies she needs.
5 (total needed) - 3 (already baked) = 2

Step 4: Determine the amount of flour she used per brownie.
She used 5 cups of flour for each brownie.

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of flour she used for the 3 brownies she baked.
To find this, we multiply the amount of flour she used per brownie by the number of brownies she baked.
5 cups/brownie * 3 brownies = 15 cups

Step 6: Calculate the amount of flour she needs for the 2 brownies she still needs to bake.
To find this, we multiply the amount of flour she used per brownie by the number of brownies she still needs to bake.
5 cups/brownie * 2 brownies = 10 cups

Step 7: Determine the total amount of flour she still needs.
To find this, we add the amount of flour she needs for the 2 brownies she still needs to bake to the amount of flour she already used.
15 cups (already used) + 10 cups (still needed) = 25 cups

Tom initially had 40 tickets. After spending 28 tickets, he has 40 - 28 = 12 tickets left.

Step 3: Determine the number of rides Tom can go on with the remaining tickets.
Each ride costs 4 tickets. To find out how many rides Tom can go on, we will divide the number of tickets he has left by the cost of each ride: 12 / 4 = 3.

   - Her friends recycled 3 pounds.
   - For every 3 pounds recycled, they earn 1 point.

3. **Calculate the points earned by Bianca**:
   Since Bianca recycled 24 pounds, we need to divide 24 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pounds she recycled.
   24 / 3 = 8
   So, Bianca earned 8 points.

4. **Calculate the points earned by her friends**:
   Her friends recycled 3 pounds. We need to divide 3 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pounds they recycled.
   3 / 3 = 1
   So, her friends earned 1 point.

5. **Calculate the total points earned by Bianca and her friends**:
   To find the total points, we need to add the points earned by Bianca and her friends.
   Total points = Bianca's points + her friends' points
   Total points = 8 + 1
   Total points = 9

6. **Conclusion**: Bianca and her friends earned a total of 9 points.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step:

1. The chef already had 8 chicken wings cooked.
2. The chef cooked 10 more chicken wings for the group.
3. The total number of chicken wings is the sum of the wings already cooked and the additional wings cooked. 
   Total chicken wings = 8 + 10 = 18

4. There are 3 friends in the group, and they will each get the same amount of chicken wings.
5. To find out how many chicken wings each person will get, we need to divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of people in the group.
   Chicken wings per person = Total chicken wings / Number of people
   Chicken wings per person = 18 / 3

6. Now, we perform the division to find the number of chicken wings each person will get.
   Chicken wings per person = 6

Therefore, each person will get 6 chicken wings.

He threw away 19 socks.

Step 3: Calculate the number of socks John had after throwing away the old ones.
Initial socks - socks thrown away = 33 - 19 = 14 socks.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of socks John had after buying new ones.
He bought 13 new socks, so we need to add these to the remaining socks.
14 (remaining socks) + 13 (new socks) = 27 socks.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of rooms the painter needs to paint.**
The painter needs to paint 6 rooms in total.

**Step 2: Determine the number of rooms the painter has already painted.**
The painter has already painted 2 rooms.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of rooms the painter still needs to paint.**
Number of rooms left to paint = Total number of rooms - Number of rooms already painted
= 6 - 2
= 4

**Step 4: Determine the time it takes to paint one room.**
Each room takes 5 hours to paint.

**Step 5: Calculate the total time it will take to paint the remaining rooms.**
Total time to paint remaining rooms = Number of rooms left to paint * Time to paint one room
= 4 * 5
= 20 hours

**Step 6: Determine the time the painter has already spent painting.**
The painter has already painted 2 rooms, so the time spent is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

**Step 7: Calculate the additional time the painter will take to paint the rest of the rooms.**
Additional time to paint the rest of the rooms = Total time to paint remaining rooms - Time spent so far

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the number of customers who left.
Given that 14 customers left, we will subtract this number from the total number of customers.

Total customers = 22
Customers who left = 14
Customers who stayed = Total customers - Customers who left
= 22 - 14
= 8

Step 2: Determine the number of tables with 4 people each.
Since the rest of the customers stayed, we will use the number of customers who stayed to find the number of tables.

Customers who stayed = 8
People per table = 4
Number of tables = Customers who stayed / People per table
= 8 / 4
= 2

Step 3: Determine the number of tables with the remaining customers.
Since there are 8 customers left and 4 people per table, we can divide the remaining customers by the number of people per table to find the number of tables.

However, we need to consider the fact that the remaining customers also include the people at the tables with 4 people each. Since we already know the number of tables with 4 people each is 2, the remaining customers who are not at tables with 4 people each are 0.

The 2 tables with 4 people each are already accounted for in the original 22 customers, so we don't need to add any more tables. The 8 customers who stayed are the 4 people at each of the 2 tables.

Therefore, the total number of tables is the sum of the tables with 4 people each and any additional tables.

Since the 2 tables with 4 people each are the only tables, the total number of tables is 2.

Roger started with 120 pieces of clothing. He put 48 of them in one load. To find the number of pieces left, we subtract 48 from 120:
120 - 48 = 72

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces of clothing that can go in each of the small loads.
Roger decided to split the remaining 72 pieces of clothing into 9 equal loads. To find the number of pieces that can go in each load, we divide 72 by 9:
72 ÷ 9 = 8

Therefore, 8 pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads.

Step 2: Calculate the number of students who remained after some left.
The number of students who remained is the original number of students minus the number of students who left:
10 - 6 = 4

Step 3: Calculate the total number of students at the end of the year.
42 new students came to school. To find the total number of students at the end of the year, we need to add the new students to the remaining students:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of sodas Cody bought.
Cody bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas. 
Total number of sodas = 4 (regular) + 44 (diet) = 48 sodas.

Step 2: Determine how many shelves Cody can fill with the sodas.
Each shelf can hold 6 sodas. 
To find out how many shelves Cody can fill, we need to divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.

Step 3: Perform the division to find the number of shelves.
Number of shelves = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
= 48 / 6
= 8

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, and Cody can't fill a shelf that's less than full, we need to consider the remaining sodas.

Step 4: Check if there are any remaining sodas.
Since 48 is evenly divisible by 6, Cody can fill 8 shelves completely. There are no remaining sodas.

Step 5: Determine the final number of shelves filled.
Since Cody can fill 8 shelves completely, he will fill 8 shelves.

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of groups that can be made with the given number of boys and girls, assuming each group has 9 members.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of students (boys + girls).
Total students = 26 (boys) + 46 (girls) = 72

Step 2: Determine the number of groups that can be formed with 9 students in each group.
To do this, we will divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group (9).

Number of groups = Total students / 9

Step 3: Perform the division to find the number of groups.
Number of groups = 72 / 9 = 8

Step 4: Consider if there are any remaining students after forming the groups.
Since we are dividing the total number of students by 9, any remaining students would indicate that we cannot form a full group with the remaining students.

Step 5: Calculate the remaining students.
Remaining students = 72 % 9 = 6

Step 6: Since we can't make a group with 6 students, the remaining students don't affect the number of full groups we can make.

Step 7: Determine the final number of groups.
Since we can form 8 groups with 9 students in each, the number of groups remains 8.

                    question:
                     The school? cafeteria ordered 6 red, apples : and 15 green! apples for students lunches.? But, if only 5 students? wanted fruit, how? many! extra did the cafeteria end up ; with?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of apples ordered by the cafeteria.
The cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples, so the total number of apples ordered is:
6 (red apples) + 15 (green apples) = 21 apples

Step 2: Determine the number of apples that were not eaten by the students.
Since only 5 students wanted fruit, and assuming each student would eat one apple (either red or green), the total number of apples eaten is:
5 (students who wanted fruit) = 5 apples

Step 3: Calculate the number of extra apples the cafeteria ended up with.
To find the number of extra apples, subtract the number of apples eaten from the total number of apples ordered:
21 (total apples ordered) - 5 (apples eaten) = 16

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 16 extra apples.

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    :  At? a : company? picnic 9, managers and 15 employees decided to start a? game of : volleyball. : If they split into 8 teams how many. people would be on each team?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many people will be on each team when the managers and employees split into 8 teams.

Step 1: Identify the total number of people.
The problem mentions ""managers and 15 employees"", but it doesn't explicitly state the number of managers. However, since it's a company picnic, we can assume that the number of managers is likely to be small compared to the number of employees. For the sake of this problem, let's assume there are 4 managers (a common number for small to medium-sized companies). 

So, the total number of people is 4 managers + 15 employees = 19 people.

Step 2: Divide the total number of people by the number of teams.
The problem states that the managers and employees split into 8 teams. 

Step 3: Calculate the number of people per team.
To find the number of people per team, we divide the total number of people by the number of teams.

Number of people per team = Total number of people / Number of teams
= 19 people / 8 teams
= 2.375 people/team

Since we cannot have a fraction of a person on a team, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of people per team. In volleyball, teams typically consist of 6 players. However, in the question, it is mentioned that they started a game of volleyball but it does not explicitly state that they will play with 6 players on each team. So, we will provide the result of the division as the solution.

To solve this problem, we will follow the steps below:

Step 1: Initially, there were 4 books in the bargain bin.

Step 2: The store sold 3 books from the bargain bin. To find out how many books were left, we subtract the number of books sold from the initial number of books:

4 (initial books) - 3 (books sold) = 1

Step 3: After selling 3 books, the store put 10 more books into the bin. To find the total number of books in the bin now, we add the number of books left after the sale to the number of new books added:

1 (books left) + 10 (new books) = 11

Step 4: Therefore, there are now 11 books in the bargain bin.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike made 42 dollars from mowing lawns over the summer.

2. He spent 10 dollars buying new mower blades.

To find out how much money Mike had left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he made:

42 (dollars made) - 10 (dollars spent) = 32 dollars left

3. Mike wants to buy 8-dollar games with the money he has left.

To find out how many games he can buy, we need to divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game:

32 (dollars left) ÷ 8 (dollars per game) = 4

Therefore, Mike can buy 4 games with the money he has left.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the number of potatoes the chef still needs to cook.
The chef needs to cook 13 potatoes and has already cooked 5.
So, the number of potatoes left to cook is 13 - 5 = 8.

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to cook one potato.
Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

Step 3: Calculate the time it will take to cook the remaining potatoes.
The chef has 8 potatoes left to cook and each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.
So, the time it will take to cook the remaining potatoes is 8 * 6 = 48 minutes.

Step 4: Determine the total time it will take the chef to cook all the potatoes.
The chef has already cooked 5 potatoes, which took 5 * 6 = 30 minutes.
The time it will take to cook the remaining potatoes is 48 minutes.
So, the total time it will take the chef to cook all the potatoes is 30 + 48 = 78 minutes.

However, the question only asks for the time it will take to cook the rest of the potatoes, not the total time. Therefore, the answer is the time it will take to cook the remaining 8 potatoes, which is 48 minutes.

Total math problems = 43
Total science problems = 12
Total problems = Total math problems + Total science problems
Total problems = 43 + 12
Total problems = 55

Step 2: Subtract the number of problems Paige finished from the total number of problems.
Number of problems Paige finished = 44
Number of problems Paige had to do = Total problems - Number of problems Paige finished
Number of problems Paige had to do = 55 - 44

Step 2: Determine how many cookies are needed for each baggie.
- Each baggie needs 6 cookies.

Step 3: Calculate the maximum number of baggies Robin can make with the available cookies.
- To find this, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies needed for each baggie.
- Number of baggies = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies per baggie
- Number of baggies = 48 cookies / 6 cookies per baggie
- Number of baggies = 8

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trays Jerry needs to pick up and then divide it by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of trays Jerry needs to pick up.
- 9 trays from one table
- 7 trays from another table
Total trays = 9 + 7 = 16 trays

Step 2: Calculate the number of trips Jerry needs to make to pick up the trays.
- Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time
- Total trays = 16
Number of trips = Total trays / Number of trays per trip = 16 / 8 = 2

However, since Jerry can't make a fraction of a trip, he will have to make an additional trip to pick up the remaining trays.

Step 3: Calculate the number of trays Jerry can pick up in the first two trips.
- 8 trays in the first trip
- 8 trays in the second trip
Total trays in first two trips = 8 + 8 = 16 trays

Since Jerry has already picked up all the trays in the first two trips, he doesn't need to make an additional trip. But we can confirm this by checking if there are any remaining trays.

Step 4: Check if there are any remaining trays.
- Total trays = 16
- Total trays picked up in first two trips = 16
Remaining trays = Total trays - Total trays picked up = 16 - 16 = 0

Since there are no remaining trays, Jerry doesn't need to make an additional trip.

                    question:
                     Faye. was? playing a : video game where she scores! 7 points for each treasure she finds. If she : found 2! treasures on the first level and 6! on? the. second, what would her ; score be?!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find Faye's score, we need to calculate the total points she earned from the treasures she found on both levels.

Step 1: Calculate the points Faye earned from the first level.
- She found 2 treasures on the first level.
- Each treasure is worth 7 points.
- So, the points from the first level are 2 * 7 = 14 points.

Step 2: Calculate the points Faye earned from the second level.
- She found 6 treasures on the second level.
- Each treasure is worth 7 points.
- So, the points from the second level are 6 * 7 = 42 points.

Step 3: Calculate Faye's total score by adding the points from both levels.
- Total score = points from the first level + points from the second level
- Total score = 14 + 42
- Total score = 56

Therefore, Faye's score would be 56 points.

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

Step 1: Megan initially picked 19 carrots from her garden.

Step 2: She threw out 4 of them, so we need to subtract 4 from 19 to find out how many carrots she has left.
19 - 4 = 15

Step 3: Megan then picked 46 more carrots the next day. To find the total number of carrots she has now, we need to add 46 to the remaining carrots she had.
15 + 46 = 61

Therefore, Megan would have 61 carrots in total.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of files deleted:
   Wendy deleted 37% of 82 files. 
   First, find 37% of 82: 
   37% of 82 = 0.37 * 82 = 30.14 (round to 30, since we can't have a fraction of a file)
   So, Wendy deleted approximately 30 files.

2. Calculate the number of files left:
   Wendy had 82 files initially and deleted 30. 
   So, the number of files left is: 
   82 - 30 = 52 files.

3. Calculate the number of folders:
   Wendy put the remaining 52 files into folders with 5 files in each one. 
   To find the number of folders, we divide the number of files left by the number of files in each folder: 
   52 / 5 = 10.4 (round to 10, since we can't have a fraction of a folder)
   So, Wendy ended up with approximately 10 folders.

To find the number of groups, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of players by adding the new and returning players.
New players = 12
Returning players = 44
Total players = New players + Returning players = 12 + 44 = 56

Step 2: Since each group will have 8 players, we need to divide the total number of players by 8 to find the number of groups.
Number of groups = Total players / Number of players in each group = 56 / 8

Step 3: Calculate the result of the division to find the number of groups.
Number of groups = 56 / 8 = 7

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, and the division result is a whole number, we don't need to round or adjust the result.

To find the answer, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Will has left after buying new mower blades.

Will initially had $104. He spent $41 on new mower blades. 

To find the amount of money left, we need to subtract the cost of the mower blades from the initial amount of money:
$104 - $41 = $63

Step 2: Determine how many $9 games Will can buy with the money he has left.

We need to divide the amount of money left ($63) by the cost of each game ($9) to find out how many games Will can buy:
$63 ÷ $9 = 7

Since we are dealing with whole numbers (you can't buy a fraction of a game), we can ignore any decimal points.

Therefore, Will can buy 7 games with the money he has left.

2. She then threw out 2 of them. To find out how many carrots she has left after throwing out 2, we subtract 2 from 12:
   12 - 2 = 10

3. The next day, she picked 21 more carrots. To find the total number of carrots she has now, we add the 21 new carrots to the 10 carrots she already had:
   10 + 21 = 31

Therefore, Nancy would have 31 carrots in total.

To solve this problem, we will break it down step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of bags Sam filled on Saturday and Sunday.
- On Saturday, Sam filled 3 bags.
- On Sunday, Sam filled 4 more bags, so the total number of bags he filled on Sunday is 3 + 4 = 7 bags.
- In total, Sam filled 3 + 7 = 10 bags.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cans in the bags.
- Each bag has 9 cans in it.
- Since Sam filled 10 bags in total, the total number of cans is 10 * 9 = 90.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The worksheet has 4 problems on it.
2. The teacher has 16 worksheets to grade.
3. The teacher has already graded 8 of them.

First, we need to find out how many worksheets the teacher still needs to grade. We can do this by subtracting the number of graded worksheets from the total number of worksheets:

16 (total worksheets) - 8 (graded worksheets) = 8

This means the teacher still has 8 worksheets to grade.

Now, we need to find out how many problems are left to grade in these 8 worksheets. Since each worksheet has 4 problems, we can multiply the number of ungraded worksheets by the number of problems per worksheet:

8 (ungraded worksheets) x 4 (problems per worksheet) = 32

Therefore, the teacher has 32 more problems to grade.

To find the total number of winter clothing items Paige has, we need to calculate the total number of scarves and mittens she found.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of scarves.
- Paige found 6 boxes of clothing.
- Inside each box, there are 5 scarves.
- So, the total number of scarves = 6 boxes * 5 scarves/box = 30 scarves.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of mittens.
- Paige found 6 boxes of clothing.
- Inside each box, there are 5 mittens.
- So, the total number of mittens = 6 boxes * 5 mittens/box = 30 mittens.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of winter clothing items.
- Total number of scarves = 30
- Total number of mittens = 30
- Total number of winter clothing items = Total number of scarves + Total number of mittens
- Total number of winter clothing items = 30 + 30 = 60

The chef needs to cook 12 potatoes and has already cooked 6. 
To find out how many potatoes are left, we subtract the number of cooked potatoes from the total number of potatoes:
12 (total potatoes) - 6 (cooked potatoes) = 6

Step 2: Calculate how many minutes it will take to cook the remaining potatoes.
Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook. 
Since there are 6 potatoes left, we multiply the number of potatoes by the cooking time per potato:
6 (potatoes left) * 6 (minutes per potato) = 36 minutes

Step 3: Determine how long it will take the chef to cook the rest of the potatoes.
The chef needs to cook the remaining 6 potatoes, which will take 36 minutes.

Since each rose is $3, the cost of one rose is $3.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of 2 roses.
Since Emily bought 2 roses, the cost of 2 roses is 2 * $3 = $6.

Step 3: Find the cost of one daisy.
Since each daisy is $3, the cost of one daisy is $3.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of 2 daisies.
Since Emily bought 2 daisies, the cost of 2 daisies is 2 * $3 = $6.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the roses and daisies.
The total cost is the sum of the cost of the roses and the cost of the daisies. So, the total cost is $6 + $6 = $12.

Therefore, Emily spent $12.

To solve this problem, we'll go step by step.

Step 1: Understand the problem
Faye and her mom are picking carrots from their garden. Faye picked 23 carrots and her mom picked 5 carrots. They found that only 12 carrots were good.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of carrots picked
To find the total number of carrots picked, we need to add the carrots picked by Faye and her mom. 
Total carrots = Faye's carrots + Mom's carrots
Total carrots = 23 + 5
Total carrots = 28

Step 3: Understand that the total number of carrots picked is the sum of good and bad carrots
Since the total number of carrots picked is 28 and only 12 are good, the remaining carrots must be bad.

Step 4: Calculate the number of bad carrots
To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots.
Bad carrots = Total carrots - Good carrots
Bad carrots = 28 - 12
Bad carrots = 16

To find the total number of tickets Oliver used, we need to calculate the total tickets used for the ferris wheel and the bumper cars, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the total tickets used for the ferris wheel.
Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times, and each ride costs 7 tickets. 
So, the total tickets used for the ferris wheel is 5 * 7 = 35 tickets.

Step 2: Calculate the total tickets used for the bumper cars.
Oliver rode the bumper cars 4 times, and each ride costs 7 tickets.
So, the total tickets used for the bumper cars is 4 * 7 = 28 tickets.

Step 3: Add the total tickets used for the ferris wheel and the bumper cars to find the total tickets used.
Total tickets used = 35 (ferris wheel) + 28 (bumper cars) = 63 tickets.

To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total time it took Wendy to put together one piece of furniture (either a chair or a table), and then multiply it by the total number of pieces.

Step 1: Calculate the total time spent on one piece of furniture.
Wendy spent 6 minutes on each piece of furniture. Since she put together one piece at a time, the total time spent on one piece is 6 minutes.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pieces of furniture.
Wendy bought 4 new chairs and 4 new tables, so the total number of pieces is 4 (chairs) + 4 (tables) = 8 pieces.

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent putting together all the pieces of furniture.
Since it takes 6 minutes to put together one piece, and there are 8 pieces in total, we multiply the time spent on one piece by the total number of pieces: 6 minutes * 8 pieces = 48 minutes.

Therefore, {The final answer is} 48.<|eot_id|>",48

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of games Ned bought.
Ned bought 50 games from a friend and 27 more at a garage sale. 
Total number of games = 50 + 27 = 77

Step 2: Calculate the number of games that didn't work.
It's given that 74 of the games didn't work.

Step 3: Calculate the number of good games Ned ended up with.
To find the number of good games, we need to subtract the number of games that didn't work from the total number of games.
Number of good games = Total number of games - Number of games that didn't work

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

Step 1: Identify the initial number of boxes Dave bought.
Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy.

Step 2: Determine the number of boxes Dave gave to his little brother.
Dave gave 5 boxes to his little brother.

Step 3: Calculate the number of boxes Dave still has.
To find the number of boxes Dave still has, we subtract the number of boxes he gave away from the initial number of boxes.
12 (initial boxes) - 5 (boxes given away) = 7

Step 4: Calculate the total number of pieces in the boxes Dave still has.
Each box has 3 pieces inside it. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of boxes Dave still has by the number of pieces per box.
7 (boxes still have) * 3 (pieces per box) = 21

Step 5: Determine the number of pieces Dave still has.
Since we calculated the total number of pieces in the boxes Dave still has, we can conclude that Dave still has 21 pieces.

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

   - The cafeteria initially had 50 apples.
   - They handed out 5 apples to students.
   - Each pie requires 5 apples.

2. **Calculating the remaining apples:**
   - Since the cafeteria handed out 5 apples, we need to subtract these from the initial total to find out how many apples are left.
   - Remaining apples = Initial apples - Apples handed out
   - Remaining apples = 50 - 5
   - Remaining apples = 45

3. **Determining the number of pies that can be made:**
   - Each pie takes 5 apples.
   - To find out how many pies can be made, we'll divide the remaining apples by the number of apples required per pie.
   - Number of pies = Remaining apples / Apples per pie
   - Number of pies = 45 / 5
   - Number of pies = 9

Step 2: They used 13 apples to make lunch for the students. To find out how many apples they had left, we need to subtract the number of apples used from the initial number of apples.

14 (initial apples) - 13 (apples used) = 1

So, they had 1 apple left after making lunch.

Step 3: Then, they bought 49 more apples. To find the total number of apples they would have, we need to add the number of apples they had left to the number of new apples they bought.

1 (apples left) + 49 (new apples) = 50

Therefore, the school cafeteria would have 50 apples.

To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the number of questions in each half.
Since there are a total of 5 questions (3 correct in the first half and 2 correct in the second half), and the game is divided into two halves, we can assume that each half has an equal number of questions. Therefore, each half has 5 / 2 = 2.5 questions. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a question, we can infer that there are 5 questions in total, which is an odd number. This means one half has 2 questions and the other half has 3 questions.

Step 2: Calculate the total points Frank scored in the first half.
Frank scored 3 questions correct in the first half. Each question is worth 3 points. So, Frank scored 3 * 3 = 9 points in the first half.

Step 3: Calculate the total points Frank scored in the second half.
Frank scored 2 questions correct in the second half. Each question is worth 3 points. So, Frank scored 2 * 3 = 6 points in the second half.

Step 4: Calculate Frank's final score by adding the points from both halves.
Frank's final score is the sum of the points he scored in the first half and the second half. So, Frank's final score is 9 + 6 = 15 points.
