                    question:
                     Paige? had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from? it and then added 8 new songs, how many songs! does she have on her mp3? player?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Paige initially has 11 songs on her mp3 player.

Step 2: She deletes 9 old songs from her mp3 player. To find out how many songs she has left after deletion, we subtract the number of deleted songs from the initial number of songs:

11 (initial songs) - 9 (deleted songs) = 2

So, after deleting 9 old songs, Paige has 2 songs left on her mp3 player.

Step 3: Then, she adds 8 new songs to her mp3 player. To find the total number of songs she now has, we add the number of new songs to the number of songs she had after deletion:

2 (songs left after deletion) + 8 (new songs) = 10

Therefore, after adding 8 new songs, Paige has 10 songs on her mp3 player.

To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we need to know the total number of students trying out and the number of students who got called back. 

Step 1: Calculate the total number of students trying out.
There were 39 girls and 4 boys, so the total number of students is:
39 (girls) + 4 (boys) = 43

Step 2: Determine the number of students who got called back.
26 students got called back.

Step 3: Calculate the number of students who didn't make the cut.
To find the number of students who didn't make the cut, subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students trying out.
43 (total students) - 26 (students called back) = 17

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Faye initially has 34 coloring books.

Step 2: She gives away 3 coloring books, so we need to subtract 3 from the initial amount:
34 - 3 = 31

Step 3: After giving away 3 coloring books, Faye now has 31 coloring books.

Step 4: Then, she buys 48 more coloring books. To find the new total, we need to add 48 to the current amount:
31 + 48 = 79

Therefore, Faye would have a total of 79 coloring books.

The school cafeteria initially had 23 apples.

Step 2: Determine the number of apples used to make lunch for the students.
They used 20 apples.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of apples after using 20 for lunch.
Remaining apples = Initial apples - Apples used
Remaining apples = 23 - 20
Remaining apples = 3

Step 4: Identify the number of apples the school cafeteria bought.
They bought 6 more apples.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of apples the school cafeteria would have after buying 6 more.
Total apples = Remaining apples + Apples bought

To find the total points earned, we need to first determine the number of enemies defeated and then multiply that by the points earned per enemy.

Step 1: Calculate the number of enemies defeated.
The level has 11 enemies total, and you destroy all but 3 of them. This means you defeat 11 - 3 = 8 enemies.

Step 2: Determine the points earned per enemy.
Each enemy defeated gives you 9 points.

Step 3: Multiply the number of enemies defeated by the points earned per enemy.
Total points = number of enemies defeated * points earned per enemy
Total points = 8 * 9

Step 4: Perform the multiplication.
8 * 9 = 72

Therefore, the total points earned would be 72.

   We are given that Megan didn't recycle 5 bags, so she recycled the remaining bags. 
   To find the number of bags she recycled, we'll subtract the number of bags she didn't recycle from the total number of bags:
   bags_recycled = total_bags - bags_not_recycled
   bags_recycled = 14 - 5
   bags_recycled = 9

3. Determine the number of points Megan earned:

To find out how much money April earned, we need to calculate the total number of roses she sold and multiply it by the price of each rose.

Step 1: Calculate the number of roses April sold.
April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left. To find out how many roses she sold, we subtract the number of roses left from the initial number of roses.
13 (initial roses) - 4 (roses left) = 9 roses sold

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money April earned.
Now that we know April sold 9 roses, we can multiply the number of roses sold by the price of each rose, which is $4.
9 (roses sold) * 4 (price per rose) = 36

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the initial number of books Tom had.
Tom initially had 5 books.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Tom earned from selling 4 books.
Since the problem doesn't specify the price of each book, we'll assume the price of each book is the same (let's call it x). If Tom sold 4 books, he earned 4x.

Step 3: Determine the number of new books Tom bought with the money he earned.
Tom used the money he earned to buy 38 new books. Since we don't know the price of each book, we'll represent the total cost as 38x (where x is the price of each book).

Step 4: Calculate the total number of books Tom has after buying 38 new books.
Initially, Tom had 5 books. He sold 4 books, so he was left with 5 - 4 = 1 book. Then, he bought 38 new books. Therefore, the total number of books Tom has is 1 (remaining book) + 38 (new books) = 39 books.

However, the problem asks us to consider the money earned from the 4 books sold. So we must consider the money earned from selling 4 books and the cost of the 38 books bought.

Step 5: Calculate the amount of money Tom spent on buying 38 books.
We already know that Tom used the money he earned from selling 4 books to buy 38 new books. Therefore, the amount of money he spent on buying 38 books is equal to the amount of money he earned from selling 4 books.

Step 6: Determine the price of each book.
Since Tom sold 4 books to earn money to buy 38 books, the price of each book (x) can be represented as the amount of money he earned from selling 4 books divided by 4. However, we can also represent the total amount of money he earned as the price of 38 books. 

Step 7: Set up an equation to determine the price of each book.
We can set up the equation: 4x = 38x, but this is incorrect because we cannot have 4x = 38x. The correct equation should be: 4x = cost of 38 books.

However, the correct equation should be: 4x = 38x because if he sold 4 books for the price of 38 books, then the price of 4 books must be the price of 38 books.

However, the equation should be 4x = 38x is incorrect because the price of 4 books should be less than the price of 38 books. Let's call the cost of 38 books as C. Then, 4x = C.

Step 8: Calculate the cost of 38 books.
We know that Tom sold 4 books to earn money to buy 38 books. Therefore, the cost of 38 books (C) is 4 times the price of each book (x). But we can also say that C is the price of 38 books. So, we can set up the equation: 4x = C, where C is the cost of 38 books.

However, we can also say that the price of 4 books is the price of 38 books. Then, the equation should be: 4x = 38x is incorrect because the price of 4 books should be less than the price of 38 books.

However, we can say that the cost of 38 books (C) is the price of 38 books. Then, we can say that C = 38x, where x is the price of each book.

However, we can also say that the cost of 38 books (C) is the price of 38 books. Then, we can say that C = 38x, where x is the price of each book.

However, we can say that the price of 4 books is the price of 38 books. Then, we can say that the price of 4 books (4x) is equal to the price of 38 books (38x).

However, we can say that the cost of 38 books (C) is the price of 38 books. Then, we can say that C = 38x, where x is the price of each book.

However, the equation should be: 4x = C, where C is the cost of 38 books.

However, we can say that the price of 4 books is the price of 38 books. Then, we can say that the price of 4 books (4x) is equal to the price of 38 books (38x).

32 + 42 = 74

Step 2: Calculate the number of candies they had left after eating 35 pieces the first night.
They had 74 candies initially and ate 35. To find the number of candies left, we subtract the number eaten from the total:
74 - 35 = 39

Step 3: Since the question asks how many pieces they have left, we don't need to do any further calculations.

Therefore, after eating 35 pieces the first night, Debby and her sister have 39 pieces of candy left.

   Remaining seeds = Initial seeds - Seeds planted in the big garden
   Remaining seeds = 41 - 29
   Remaining seeds = 12

2. Since Emily planted 4 seeds in each small garden, we need to find out how many small gardens she could fill with the remaining seeds.
   To do this, we divide the remaining seeds by the number of seeds planted in each small garden.
   Number of small gardens = Remaining seeds / Seeds per small garden

Since there are 82 books in total and the librarian takes 10, we subtract 10 from 82 to get the number of books left.

Number of books left = 82 - 10 = 72

Step 2: Determine the number of shelves needed to fit the remaining books.
Since Mike can fit 9 books on a shelf, we need to divide the number of books left by 9 to get the number of shelves needed.

Number of shelves needed = Number of books left / 9
= 72 / 9
= 8

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, and 72 is exactly divisible by 9, we do not need to worry about this.

Step 3: Confirm the number of shelves needed.
Based on the previous step, we can confirm that Mike will need 8 shelves to fit the remaining books.

                     While on vacation, : Nancy, took 49 pictures at the zoo and 8 at the museum. If she later deleted 38 of the pictures, how many pictures from her vacation, did she still have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pictures Nancy took during her vacation.
Nancy took 49 pictures at the zoo and 8 pictures at the museum. To find the total number of pictures, we need to add these two numbers together.

49 (pictures at the zoo) + 8 (pictures at the museum) = 57 pictures

Step 2: Calculate the number of pictures Nancy had after deleting 38 pictures.
Nancy had 57 pictures initially and deleted 38 of them. To find the number of pictures she still had, we need to subtract 38 from 57.

57 - 38 = 19 pictures

Step 3: Determine the number of pictures Nancy still had after deleting 38 pictures.
Based on the calculation in step 2, Nancy still had 19 pictures after deleting 38.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of windows left to install.
The builder needs 14 windows in total and has already installed 8.
So, the number of windows left to install = 14 - 8 = 6

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to install one window.
It takes 8 hours to install each window.

Step 3: Calculate the time it will take to install the rest of the windows.
Since it takes 8 hours to install one window, and there are 6 windows left to install,
The total time it will take to install the rest of the windows = 6 * 8 = 48 hours

Step 4: Therefore, it will take the builder 48 hours to install the rest of the windows.

The store had 40 oranges initially.

Step 2: Calculate the number of oranges thrown away.
The store threw away 25 old oranges.

Step 3: Subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number.
40 (initial oranges) - 25 (oranges thrown away) = 15

Step 4: Calculate the total number of oranges after adding the new ones.
The store put 21 new oranges in the bin.

Step 5: Add the remaining oranges to the new ones.
15 (remaining oranges) + 21 (new oranges) = 36

Therefore, there are 36 oranges in the bin after throwing away the old ones and adding the new ones.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the number of customers who left a tip.
We are given that 5 customers out of 7 didn't leave a tip, so the number of customers who left a tip is 7 - 5 = 2.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money the waiter earned from the customers who left a tip.
Each customer who left a tip gave the waiter $3. Since there were 2 customers who left a tip, the total amount of money the waiter earned from them is 2 x $3 = $6.

Step 3: Since the problem asks how much money the waiter earned, we need to consider the total amount he earned from all customers who tipped, which is $6, and this is the final amount.

47 - 25 = 22

Step 3: After eating 25 pieces, Faye has 22 pieces left. Then, her sister gives her 40 more pieces.

Step 4: We need to add the 40 pieces her sister gave her to the 22 pieces she already has.
22 + 40 = 62

Total chicken wings = Initial chicken wings + Additional chicken wings
Total chicken wings = 9 + 7
Total chicken wings = 16

Step 2: Divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends to determine how many each person gets.
Number of friends = 4
Chicken wings per person = Total chicken wings / Number of friends
Chicken wings per person = 16 / 4

Step 3: Perform the division to find out how many chicken wings each person gets.

To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of puppies in the shelter after new puppies were brought in.

Initial number of puppies = 5
Number of new puppies brought in = 35
Total number of puppies = 5 + 35 = 40

Step 2: Determine the rate at which puppies are being adopted.

Number of puppies adopted per day = 8

Step 3: Calculate the number of days it would take to adopt all the puppies.

Total number of puppies = 40
Number of puppies adopted per day = 8

To find the number of days, we will divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Number of days = Total number of puppies / Number of puppies adopted per day
= 40 / 8
= 5

Therefore, it would take 5 days to adopt all the puppies.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many shelves the store used to put the bears.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of bears in stock.
The store initially had 17 bears. They received another shipment with 10 bears.
Total number of bears = 17 (initial bears) + 10 (new bears)
Total number of bears = 27

Step 2: Determine how many bears can be placed on each shelf.
The store puts 9 bears on each shelf.

Step 3: Calculate the number of shelves used.
To find out the number of shelves used, we need to divide the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf.
Number of shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears per shelf
Number of shelves = 27 / 9

Step 4: Perform the division.
27 / 9 = 3

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, we need to check if the division results in a whole number. In this case, it does.

To find the total number of books Gwen had, we need to calculate the number of books on the mystery bookshelves and the picture bookshelves separately, and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the number of books on the mystery bookshelves.
Since each shelf has exactly 4 books and there are 5 shelves of mystery books, we multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf:
5 shelves * 4 books/shelf = 20 books

Step 2: Calculate the number of books on the picture bookshelves.
Since each shelf has exactly 4 books and there are 3 shelves of picture books, we multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf:
3 shelves * 4 books/shelf = 12 books

Step 3: Add the number of books on the mystery bookshelves and the picture bookshelves to find the total number of books.
20 books (mystery) + 12 books (picture) = 32 books

To find out how many pictures were in each album, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of pictures Wendy uploaded.
Wendy uploaded 79 pictures to Facebook.

Step 2: Determine the number of pictures Wendy put into one album.
Wendy put 44 pictures into one album.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pictures Wendy put into the 5 different albums.
To find this, we need to subtract the number of pictures in the one album from the total number of pictures.
pictures_in_five_albums = total_pictures - pictures_in_one_album
pictures_in_five_albums = 79 - 44
pictures_in_five_albums = 35

Step 4: Calculate the number of pictures in each of the 5 different albums.
To find this, we need to divide the number of pictures in the 5 albums by the number of albums.
pictures_per_album = pictures_in_five_albums / number_of_albums
pictures_per_album = 35 / 5
pictures_per_album = 7

April started with 9 roses and had 4 roses left. To find the number of roses she sold, we subtract the number of roses left from the initial number of roses.

Number of roses sold = Initial number of roses - Number of roses left
= 9 - 4
= 5

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money April earned.
Since each rose was $7 and April sold 5 roses, we multiply the number of roses sold by the price of each rose.

To find out how much money Victor made in those two days, we need to calculate his total earnings.

Step 1: Calculate Victor's earnings for Monday.
Since Victor made 6 dollars an hour and he worked 5 hours on Monday, we multiply the hourly wage by the number of hours worked:
6 dollars/hour * 5 hours = 30 dollars

Step 2: Calculate Victor's earnings for Tuesday.
Since Victor made 6 dollars an hour and he worked 5 hours on Tuesday, we multiply the hourly wage by the number of hours worked:
6 dollars/hour * 5 hours = 30 dollars

Step 3: Calculate Victor's total earnings for the two days.
To find the total earnings, we add the earnings from Monday and Tuesday:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of flowers Wendy has left after some wilted.
Wendy had 103 flowers initially, but 47 wilted. To find the number of flowers she has left, we subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total:

103 (initial flowers) - 47 (wilted flowers) = 56

Step 2: Determine the number of bouquets Wendy can make with the remaining flowers.
Since each bouquet requires 8 flowers, we need to divide the number of remaining flowers by 8 to find out how many bouquets she can make:

56 (remaining flowers) ÷ 8 (flowers per bouquet) = 7

Since we cannot make a fraction of a bouquet, we can still make 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers.

Step 3: Consider if there are any remaining flowers after making the bouquets.
To find out if there are any remaining flowers, we multiply the number of bouquets by the number of flowers per bouquet and subtract this from the total number of remaining flowers:

7 (bouquets) × 8 (flowers per bouquet) = 56
56 (remaining flowers) - 56 = 0

There are no remaining flowers after making the bouquets.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Adam earned from selling 19 books.
Since the price of each book is not given, we assume the price of each book is the same. However, to calculate the number of books Adam has after buying new books, we do not need to know the price of each book. We just need to know the number of books he sold and bought.

Step 2: Determine the number of books Adam bought with the money he earned.
Adam sold 19 books and bought 38 new books.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of books Adam has.
To do this, we add the number of books Adam had initially (48), subtract the number of books he sold (19), and then add the number of new books he bought (38).

Total number of books = Initial number of books - Number of books sold + Number of new books bought
Total number of books = 48 - 19 + 38

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of apples left after handing out 42 to students.
The cafeteria initially had 96 apples. After handing out 42, they have:
96 (initial apples) - 42 (apples handed out) = 54 apples left

Step 2: Calculate the number of pies that can be made with the remaining apples.
Each pie takes 6 apples. To find the number of pies that can be made, we divide the number of remaining apples by 6:
54 (remaining apples) ÷ 6 (apples per pie) = 9

Therefore, the cafeteria can make 9 pies.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much flour Tiffany already used and then subtract that from the total amount of flour she needs.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of flour Tiffany needs.
She needs 17 brownies and each brownie requires 8 cups of flour. To find the total amount of flour needed, we multiply the number of brownies by the amount of flour per brownie:
17 brownies * 8 cups/brownie = 136 cups

Step 2: Calculate the amount of flour Tiffany already used.
She baked 8 brownies and each brownie requires 8 cups of flour. To find the amount of flour used, we multiply the number of brownies by the amount of flour per brownie:
8 brownies * 8 cups/brownie = 64 cups

Step 3: Calculate the amount of flour Tiffany still needs.
To find the amount of flour still needed, we subtract the amount of flour already used from the total amount of flour needed:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of carrots picked by Carol and her mom.
Carol picked 29 carrots and her mom picked 16 carrots. 
So, the total number of carrots picked = 29 + 16 = 45

Step 2: We are given that only 38 carrots were good.
This means that the remaining carrots are bad.

Step 3: To find the number of bad carrots, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots.
Number of bad carrots = Total number of carrots - Number of good carrots
= 45 - 38

Step 4: Perform the subtraction.
Number of bad carrots = 45 - 38 = 7

To find out how many more problems the teacher has to grade, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of problems in all the worksheets.
Each worksheet has 7 problems. The teacher has 17 worksheets.
Total number of problems = 7 * 17 = 119

Step 2: Determine the number of problems that have already been graded.
The teacher has already graded 8 worksheets.
Number of problems already graded = 7 * 8 = 56

Step 3: Determine the number of problems that still need to be graded.
Number of problems still to be graded = Total number of problems - Number of problems already graded
= 119 - 56
= 63

Step 4: Determine how many more problems the teacher has to grade.
Since each worksheet has 7 problems, we need to divide the total number of problems still to be graded by 7.
Number of worksheets still to be graded = 63 / 7

49 (initial tickets) - 25 (tickets spent on beanie) = 24

So, Cody has 24 tickets left.

**Step 3:** Cody later won 6 more tickets. To find the total number of tickets he now has, we need to add 6 to the 24 tickets he had left.

Step 2: Determine how many piles Bianca can make with the remaining pieces of candy.
Each pile has 8 pieces of candy, so to find out how many piles she can make, we need to divide the number of pieces she has left by 8.

Step 3: Calculate the number of piles Bianca can make.
48 pieces / 8 pieces per pile = 6 piles

                    question:
                     Nancy had 80 files on her? computer. She deleted 31 of them and put the rest into : folders with 7 files in each one. How many folders did Nancy end up with?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of files Nancy had after deleting 31 files.
Nancy initially had 80 files. After deleting 31 files, she had:
80 - 31 = 49 files

Step 2: Determine how many files will be in each folder.
Nancy put the remaining files into folders with 7 files in each one.

Step 3: Calculate the number of folders Nancy ended up with.
To find the number of folders, we need to divide the total number of files (49) by the number of files in each folder (7).
49 ÷ 7 = 7

Since we cannot have a fraction of a folder, we can ignore any remainder. In this case, the division results in a whole number, so we do not need to round up or down.

                     Luke was, selling his old games. He started out with 39 but sold 19 of them. He packed ; the rest up putting 4 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the number of games Luke has left after selling 19 games.
Luke started with 39 games and sold 19 games.
Number of games left = 39 - 19
Number of games left = 20

Step 2: Determine the number of boxes needed to pack the remaining games.
Each box can hold 4 games.
To find the number of boxes needed, divide the number of games left by the number of games per box.
Number of boxes needed = Number of games left / Number of games per box
Number of boxes needed = 20 / 4

Step 3: Calculate the result of the division to determine the number of boxes needed.
20 / 4 = 5

Therefore, Luke had to use 5 boxes to pack the remaining games.

                    question:
                     There are 65 students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 17 of them didn't get picked? for the team and the rest were put into 8 groups, how many students would be in each group?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find out how many students would be in each group, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find out how many students got picked for the team**: 
Since 17 students didn't get picked, we subtract this number from the total number of students trying out (65) to find the number of students who got picked.

65 (total students) - 17 (students not picked) = 48 (students picked)

2. **Determine the number of students in each group**:
We know that the rest of the students (48) were put into 8 groups. To find the number of students in each group, we divide the total number of students who got picked (48) by the number of groups (8).

48 (students picked) ÷ 8 (groups) = 6

So, there would be 6 students in each group.

Isabel uploaded 25 pictures to Facebook.

Step 2: Calculate the number of pictures Isabel put into the first album.
She put 10 pictures into the first album.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pictures Isabel put into the other albums.
Since she put 10 pictures into the first album, we need to subtract 10 from the total number of pictures to find out how many pictures are left for the other albums.
25 (total pictures) - 10 (pictures in the first album) = 15

Step 4: Calculate the number of pictures Isabel put into each of the other albums.
There are 5 different albums, and 15 pictures are left to be put into these albums. To find out how many pictures will be in each album, we need to divide 15 by 5.

Total earnings = 14 + 26 = 40 dollars

Step 2: Calculate Mike's weekly expenses
Mike spent 5 dollars per week.

Step 3: Calculate how long Mike's money will last
To find out how long Mike's money will last, we divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses:

Music files = 16
Video files = 48
Total files initially = Music files + Video files
Total files initially = 16 + 48
Total files initially = 64

Step 2: Since Vanessa deleted 30 files, we need to subtract the number of deleted files from the total number of files initially to find the number of files still on her flash drive.
Files deleted = 30
Files still on the flash drive = Total files initially - Files deleted

The shelter initially had 2 puppies and then 34 more were brought in.
Total puppies = Initial puppies + New puppies
Total puppies = 2 + 34
Total puppies = 36

Step 2: Calculate the number of puppies left to be adopted.
Since all the puppies need to be adopted, the number of puppies left to be adopted is the same as the total number of puppies.
Puppies left to be adopted = Total puppies
Puppies left to be adopted = 36

Step 3: Determine the rate at which puppies are adopted.
Puppies are adopted at a rate of 4 puppies per day.
Adoption rate = 4 puppies/day

Step 4: Calculate the number of days it would take to adopt all the puppies.
To find the number of days, we can divide the number of puppies left to be adopted by the adoption rate.

Total number of books = Number of adventure books + Number of mystery books
Total number of books = 32 + 37
Total number of books = 69

Step 2: Since 16 of the books were used, we need to subtract the number of used books from the total number of books to find the number of new books Victor bought.

Now, we need to subtract the number of roses she sold from the initial number of roses. 
So, we'll subtract 15 from 50.

50 - 15 = 35

Step 3: Then, she picked 21 more roses. 
Now, we need to add the number of roses she picked to the number of roses she had left after selling some.

To find the total number of problems Isabel had to complete, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages of math and reading homework.
Isabel had 2 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading homework.
Total pages = 2 (math) + 4 (reading) = 6 pages.

Step 2: Since each page has 5 problems on it, we need to multiply the total number of pages by the number of problems per page.
Total problems = Total pages * Number of problems per page
= 6 * 5
= 30

Step 3: Therefore, the total number of problems Isabel had to complete is 30.

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Kaleb has left after buying the game.**

Kaleb initially had $12.
He spent $8 on a new game.
To find the amount of money he has left, we subtract the cost of the game from his initial amount:
$12 - $8 = $4

**Step 2: Determine how many 2-dollar toys Kaleb can buy with the money he has left.**

We know that Kaleb has $4 left and each toy costs $2.
To find out how many toys he can buy, we'll divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each toy:
$4 ÷ $2 = 2

Since we're dealing with whole numbers (you can't buy a fraction of a toy), the result is a whole number.

**The final answer is 2.**<|eot_id|>",2,2.0,2.0

To find the total number of songs Janet bought, we need to calculate the total number of songs from country albums and pop albums separately, and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of songs from country albums
- Janet bought 6 country albums
- Each album has 9 songs
- So, the total number of songs from country albums = 6 * 9 = 54

Step 2: Calculate the total number of songs from pop albums
- Janet bought 2 pop albums
- Each album has 9 songs
- So, the total number of songs from pop albums = 2 * 9 = 18

Step 3: Calculate the total number of songs Janet bought
- Total number of songs from country albums = 54
- Total number of songs from pop albums = 18
- So, the total number of songs Janet bought = 54 + 18 = 72

To find out how long the money will last, we need to calculate Jerry's total earnings and then subtract his weekly expenses.

Step 1: Calculate Jerry's total earnings.
Jerry made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 31 dollars weed eating.
Total earnings = 14 + 31 = 45 dollars

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Jerry has left after spending 5 dollars a week.
Weekly expenses = 5 dollars
Weekly earnings = Total earnings = 45 dollars
Since we don't know the number of weeks, we'll call it 'x'. 
Total money spent in x weeks = 5x
Total money left after x weeks = 45 - 5x

However, to find the duration, we need to know the total amount of money Jerry has. Since we are not given that information, we will assume the total amount of money Jerry has is the total earnings.

Step 3: Determine how long the money will last.
We'll set up an equation to find out how many weeks the money will last.
Let's say the money will last for 'x' weeks.
45 - 5x = 0 (since he will run out of money)

Step 4: Solve the equation for 'x'.
45 - 5x = 0
5x = 45
x = 45 / 5
x = 9

However, this is not the final answer. The final answer will depend on whether we are calculating the number of weeks from the start or the number of weeks after he has already made the money.

Step 5: Calculate the number of weeks from the start.
If we are calculating the number of weeks from the start, then the money will last for 9 weeks.

Step 6: Calculate the number of weeks after he has already made the money.
If we are calculating the number of weeks after he has already made the money, then the money will last for 9 weeks.

However, the problem does not specify whether we are calculating the number of weeks from the start or the number of weeks after he has already made the money.

Given the information provided, it is not possible to determine the exact number of weeks the money will last. However, if we are to choose one of the two possible answers, then the money will last for 9 weeks.

                    question:
                     Adam had 33 books. If he sold 11? of them and used the money he earned to buy 23 new books,. how many books. would Adam have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of books Adam sold.
11/10 (or 11 percent) of 33 books is the number of books Adam sold.
11/10 * 33 = 11 * 3.3 = 36.3
Since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we'll assume Adam sold 36 books.

Step 2: Calculate the number of books Adam had after selling 36 books.
Adam had 33 books initially and sold 36 books, but since we can't sell more books than Adam has, we'll assume Adam had 33 books and sold 33 books, or Adam had 33 books and sold 32 books and used the remaining money to buy 23 books.
However, let's continue with the assumption that Adam sold 36 books. Then, Adam had 33 - 36 = -3 books left.
But, since Adam can't have a negative number of books, we'll assume Adam sold 33 books and used the remaining money to buy 23 books.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of books Adam had after buying 23 new books.
Adam had 33 books initially and sold 33 books, so he had 33 - 33 = 0 books left.
Then, he used the money he earned to buy 23 new books.
So, the total number of books Adam had is 0 + 23 = 23 books.

However, this solution is not feasible as Adam would not have any money left after selling all his books.<|eot_id|>",45,45.0,23.0

Since each bag has 4 cans in it, we have:
Cans per bag = 4

Step 2: Calculate the total number of bags Kaleb filled.
On Saturday, he filled 5 bags, and on Sunday, he filled 5 more bags. So, the total number of bags he filled is:
Total bags = 5 (Saturday) + 5 (Sunday) = 10

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cans Kaleb collected.

There are 2 shelves of mystery books, and each shelf has exactly 6 books on it.
Number of mystery books = 2 shelves * 6 books/shelf = 12 books

Step 2: Calculate the number of books on the picture book shelves.
There are 6 shelves of picture books, and each shelf has exactly 6 books on it.
Number of picture books = 6 shelves * 6 books/shelf = 36 books

Step 3: Add the number of mystery books and picture books to find the total number of books.

To find the number of folders Katie ended up with, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Step 1: Calculate the number of files Katie had left after deleting 40 files.**
   - Katie started with 85 files.
   - She deleted 40 files.
   - To find the number of files left, subtract the number of files deleted from the total number of files:
     85 (initial files) - 40 (files deleted) = 45 (files left)

2. **Step 2: Calculate the number of folders Katie can create with the remaining files.**
   - Since each folder can have 5 files, divide the number of files left by 5 to find the number of folders:
     45 (files left) / 5 (files per folder) = 9 (folders)

3. **Step 3: Consider if there are any remaining files that cannot be placed in a folder.**
   - Since we divided 45 (files left) by 5 (files per folder), we should check if there are any remaining files.
   - If there are any remaining files, it means the division was not exact, and we should round down to the nearest whole number, as we cannot have a fraction of a folder.
   - In this case, 45 / 5 = 9, which is an exact division, so there are no remaining files.

Since there are no remaining files and we have an exact division, the number of folders Katie ended up with is equal to the result from step 2.

3. Each member that showed up scored 6 points.
4. Since there were 3 members present and each scored 6 points, we need to find the total points scored by these 3 members.

To find the total points scored, we multiply the number of members present (3) by the points each member scored (6):

3 (members) * 6 (points per member) = 18

So, the total points scored by the team is 18.

                    question:
                     Oliver is, at the library helping put! away books. : There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how! many shelves will he need?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of books Oliver is left with.
There are 46 books in total, and a librarian takes 10 of them. So, the number of books Oliver is left with is:
46 - 10 = 36

Step 2: Calculate the number of shelves Oliver will need to put away the remaining books.
Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf. To find out how many shelves he will need, we need to divide the total number of books he has by the number of books he can fit on a shelf:
36 ÷ 4 = 9

Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, and 9 shelves can fit all the books, Oliver will need 9 shelves.

There are 3 coins in each pile.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of coins in the quarters piles.
There are 5 piles of quarters, and each pile has 3 quarters.
5 piles * 3 quarters/pile = 15 quarters

Step 3: Calculate the total number of coins in the dimes piles.
There are 5 piles of dimes, and each pile has 3 dimes.
5 piles * 3 dimes/pile = 15 dimes

Step 4: Calculate the total number of coins.
Add the total number of quarters and dimes.

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Gwen and her friends : were recycling paper for : their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Gwen recycled 5 pounds and her friends recycled 13, pounds, how many points did they earn?!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find the total points earned by Gwen and her friends, we need to calculate the points earned from Gwen's recycling and her friends' recycling separately, and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the points earned from Gwen's recycling.
Gwen recycled 5 pounds. For every 3 pounds they recycled, they earned 1 point. So, we need to divide 5 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pounds Gwen recycled.
5 ÷ 3 = 1.67 (approximately)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a point, we will round down to the nearest whole number. However, to avoid losing points, we will calculate the points earned for 5 pounds and 6 pounds separately.

For 5 pounds: 5 ÷ 3 = 1.67, so Gwen earned 1 point for 5 pounds (rounding down to the nearest whole number) and 1/3 of a point for 2 pounds. To find the total points earned, we can use the formula: points = (5/3) * (3/3) = (5/3) * 1 = 5/3 = 1.67 (approximately). Since Gwen can only earn 1 point for 5 pounds, we will assume she earned 1 point for 5 pounds and 1/3 of a point for 2 pounds.

However, to simplify the problem, let's calculate Gwen's points earned as 5 pounds is 1.67 sets of 3 pounds and 1/3 of a set is 1/3 of a point.

Step 2: Calculate the points earned from Gwen's friends' recycling.
Gwen's friends recycled 13 pounds. For every 3 pounds they recycled, they earned 1 point. So, we need to divide 13 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pounds Gwen's friends recycled.
13 ÷ 3 = 4.33 (approximately)

For 12 pounds: 12 ÷ 3 = 4, so Gwen's friends earned 4 points for 12 pounds. For 1 pound: 1 ÷ 3 = 0.33, so Gwen's friends earned 0.33 points for 1 pound.

Step 3: Calculate the total points earned by Gwen and her friends.
Total points earned by Gwen = 1 (for 5 pounds) + 1/3 (for 2 pounds) = 1.33 (approximately)
Total points earned by Gwen's friends = 4 (for 12 pounds) + 0.33 (for 1 pound) = 4.33 (approximately)
Total points earned by Gwen and her friends = 1.33 + 4.33 = 5.66 (approximately)

Since Gwen and her friends can only earn whole points, we will round down to the nearest whole number. However, to avoid losing points, we will assume they earned 5 points and 2/3 of a point.

To find the total points earned, we can use the formula: total points = (5/3 + 4.33) * 1 = 5.66 (approximately). Since Gwen and her friends can only earn whole points, we will assume they earned 5 points and 2/3 of a point.

However, to simplify the problem, let's calculate Gwen's and her friends' points earned as 5 pounds is 1.67 sets of 3 pounds, 13 pounds is 4.33 sets of 3 pounds, and 1/3 of a set is 1/3 of a point.

Since 5 pounds is 1.67 sets of 3 pounds and 13 pounds is 4.33 sets of 3 pounds, we can calculate the points earned by Gwen and her friends as follows:
Gwen's points earned = 1.67 (for 5 pounds) * 1 + 4.33 (for 13 pounds) * 0 = 1.67 + 0 = 1.67 (approximately)
Gwen's friends' points earned = 1.67 (for 5 pounds) * 0 + 4.33 (for 13 pounds) * 1 = 0 + 4.33 = 4.33 (approximately)
Total points earned by Gwen and her friends = 1.67 + 4.33 = 6 (approximately)

However, we know that Gwen recycled 5 pounds and her friends recycled 13 pounds. To find the total points earned, we can use the formula: total points = (5 + 13) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6.

- Each cage has 8 parrots and 2 parakeets.
- The total number of birds in one cage is 8 (parrots) + 2 (parakeets) = 10 birds.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of birds in all cages.
- The pet store has 4 bird cages.
- The total number of birds in all cages is 10 (birds per cage) * 4 (number of cages) = 40 birds.

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boxes Kaleb has after giving 5 boxes to his little brother:
   Kaleb initially bought 14 boxes. He gave 5 boxes to his little brother. 
   To find the number of boxes Kaleb has left, we subtract the number of boxes he gave away from the initial number:
   14 (initial boxes) - 5 (boxes given away) = 9 boxes

2. Calculate the total number of pieces in the 9 boxes:
   Each box contains 6 pieces. To find the total number of pieces in the 9 boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces in each box:
   9 boxes * 6 pieces/box = 54 pieces

3. Determine the number of pieces Kaleb still has:
   Since Kaleb gave away 5 boxes, and we know each box contains 6 pieces, we can calculate the number of pieces he gave away:
   5 boxes * 6 pieces/box = 30 pieces
   To find the number of pieces Kaleb still has, we subtract the number of pieces he gave away from the total number of pieces:
   54 pieces (total) - 30 pieces (given away) = 24 pieces

                    question:
                     John was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 3 on each page. If he had 8 new cards and 16 old cards to put in the binder, how many : pages would he use?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find the total number of pages John will use, we need to calculate the total number of cards he has and then divide that by the number of cards per page.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of new and old cards John has.
Total cards = new cards + old cards
Total cards = 8 + 16
Total cards = 24

Step 2: Since there are 3 cards on each page, we need to divide the total number of cards by 3 to find the total number of pages.
Total pages = Total cards / cards per page
Total pages = 24 / 3
Total pages = 8

Therefore, John will use 8 pages in the binder.

                     Isabel baked 3 brownies, but needed ; 5 total? for her party. If she used 5 cups of flour. on each one, how much cups of flour. does she still need?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of flour Isabel used for the 3 brownies.

Since Isabel used 5 cups of flour for each brownie and she baked 3 brownies, we can calculate the total amount of flour used as follows:

Total flour used = Number of brownies * Flour used per brownie
Total flour used = 3 * 5
Total flour used = 15 cups

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of flour needed for the party.

Isabel needs 5 total brownies for her party. We are given that she needs 5 total brownies, so we assume that 5 total brownies means 5 total brownies, and she needs 5 cups of flour for each one.

Total flour needed = Number of brownies * Flour used per brownie
Total flour needed = 5 * 5
Total flour needed = 25 cups

Step 3: Calculate the amount of flour Isabel still needs.

To find out how much flour Isabel still needs, we subtract the total amount of flour used from the total amount of flour needed:

Flour still needed = Total flour needed - Total flour used
Flour still needed = 25 - 15
Flour still needed = 10 cups

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Maria initially made 19 cupcakes.

Step 2: She sold 5 cupcakes. To find out how many cupcakes she has left, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes sold from the initial number of cupcakes.
19 (initial cupcakes) - 5 (cupcakes sold) = 14

Step 3: Then, Maria made 10 more cupcakes. To find out the total number of cupcakes she now has, we need to add the number of cupcakes made to the number of cupcakes left after selling some.
14 (cupcakes left) + 10 (new cupcakes made) = 24

So, after making 10 more cupcakes, Maria would have 24 cupcakes in total.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair.
We know that Tom has 40 tickets initially.

Step 2: He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth.
Tom now has 40 - 28 = 12 tickets left after spending at the 'dunk a clown' booth.

Step 3: If each ride cost 4 tickets, how many rides could he go on?
To find out how many rides Tom can go on, we need to divide the remaining tickets by the cost of each ride.

Step 4: Divide the remaining tickets by the cost of each ride.
12 tickets / 4 tickets per ride = 3 rides.

Therefore, Tom can go on 3 rides.

To find the number of students at the end of the year, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the initial number of students.
There were 31 students at the start of the year.

Step 2: Calculate the number of students who left during the year.
5 students left.

Step 3: Calculate the change in the number of students due to new students joining.
11 new students came to school.

Step 4: Calculate the net change in the number of students.
Since 5 students left, but 11 new students came, the net change is 11 - 5 = 6.

Step 5: Calculate the final number of students.
To find the final number of students, we need to add the net change to the initial number of students.
Initial number of students: 31
Net change: 6
Final number of students: 31 + 6 = 37

Therefore, there were 37 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of towels Maria initially bought.
Maria bought 35 green towels and 21 white towels.
So, the total number of towels she bought is: 35 (green) + 21 (white) = 56 towels.

Step 2: Determine the total number of towels Maria gave to her mother.
Maria gave her mother 34 towels.

Step 3: Calculate the number of towels Maria has left after giving some to her mother.
To do this, we need to subtract the number of towels she gave away from the total number of towels she initially bought.
So, the number of towels Maria has left is: 56 (initial towels) - 34 (towels given away) = 22 towels.

Therefore, Maria ended up with 22 towels.

To find out how many chicken wings each person would get, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total number of chicken wings cooked for the group. The chef already had 8 chicken wings cooked and then cooked 10 more. 

   Total number of chicken wings = 8 (initial) + 10 (additional) = 18

2. Since there are 3 friends in the group, we need to divide the total number of chicken wings by 3 to find out how many each person would get.

   Number of chicken wings per person = Total number of chicken wings / Number of friends
                                       = 18 / 3

To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to paint all 6 rooms.**

Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the total time required to paint all 6 rooms is:
6 rooms * 5 hours/room = 30 hours

**Step 2: Calculate the time already spent painting 2 rooms.**

Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the time already spent painting 2 rooms is:
2 rooms * 5 hours/room = 10 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining time required to paint the rest of the rooms.**

To find the remaining time, we need to subtract the time already spent from the total time required:
30 hours (total time) - 10 hours (time already spent) = 20 hours

**Step 4: Calculate how much longer it will take to paint the rest of the rooms.**

Since the painter has already painted 2 rooms, there are 4 rooms left to paint. Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the time required to paint the rest of the rooms is:
4 rooms * 5 hours/room = 20 hours

Therefore, the painter will take 20 hours longer to paint the rest of the rooms.

                    question:
                     Roger is at the, library helping put away books. There are 14 book to put away total but? a librarian takes : 2 of them and leaves! Roger with the rest. If he can fit 3 books on a shelf, : how many shelves will he need?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the initial number of books.
There are 14 books in total.

Step 2: Identify the number of books taken by the librarian.
The librarian takes 2 books.

Step 3: Calculate the number of books left for Roger.
14 (initial books) - 2 (books taken by the librarian) = 12 books left for Roger.

Step 4: Determine how many books Roger can fit on a shelf.
Roger can fit 3 books on a shelf.

Step 5: Calculate the number of shelves Roger needs to put away the books.
To find the number of shelves, divide the total number of books by the number of books that can fit on a shelf.
12 (books left) / 3 (books per shelf) = 4 shelves.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, and there are 12 books, which is exactly divisible by 3, we can say that Roger can put away the books with no remainder.

To find the extra flowers Bianca picked, we need to first find the total number of flowers she picked and then subtract the number of flowers she actually used.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers Bianca picked.
Bianca picked 39 tulips and 49 roses.
Total flowers = 39 (tulips) + 49 (roses) = 88

Step 2: Calculate the number of extra flowers Bianca picked.
Bianca used 81 flowers out of the total of 88 flowers she picked.
Extra flowers = Total flowers - Flowers used
Extra flowers = 88 - 81

Step 3: Perform the subtraction to find the extra flowers.
Extra flowers = 88 - 81 = 7

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of chairs and tables Emily bought.
Emily bought 4 new chairs and 2 new tables.

Step 2: Determine the total number of pieces of furniture.
To find the total number of pieces, we need to add the number of chairs and tables. 
Total number of pieces = Number of chairs + Number of tables
Total number of pieces = 4 + 2
Total number of pieces = 6

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent putting the furniture together.
Emily spent 8 minutes on each piece of furniture. 
To find the total time, we need to multiply the time spent on each piece by the total number of pieces.
Total time = Time spent on each piece * Total number of pieces
Total time = 8 * 6
Total time = 48

Therefore, it took Emily 48 minutes to finish putting the furniture together.

To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we need to calculate the number of parrots and parakeets separately and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the number of parrots in the pet store.
There are 6 bird cages, and each cage has 2 parrots. So, the total number of parrots is:
6 cages * 2 parrots per cage = 12 parrots

Step 2: Calculate the number of parakeets in the pet store.
There are 6 bird cages, and each cage has 7 parakeets. So, the total number of parakeets is:
6 cages * 7 parakeets per cage = 42 parakeets

Step 3: Calculate the total number of birds in the pet store.
The total number of birds is the sum of the number of parrots and parakeets:
12 parrots + 42 parakeets = 54 birds

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many shirts Dave did not wash. We know that he had to wash 9 short-sleeve shirts and 27 long-sleeve shirts, for a total of 36 shirts. We also know that he washed 20 shirts by the time school started.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of shirts Dave had to wash.
9 (short-sleeve shirts) + 27 (long-sleeve shirts) = 36 shirts

Step 2: Determine how many shirts Dave washed.
We are given that he washed 20 shirts.

Step 3: Calculate the number of shirts Dave did not wash.
To find the number of shirts Dave did not wash, we need to subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts.
36 (total shirts) - 20 (shirts washed) = 16

Therefore, Dave did not wash 16 shirts.

To find the total number of pictures Haley still has, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pictures taken by Haley.
Haley took 50 pictures at the zoo and 8 at the museum. 
Total pictures taken = 50 (at the zoo) + 8 (at the museum)
Total pictures taken = 58

Step 2: Calculate the number of pictures Haley still has after deleting 38 pictures.
Number of pictures deleted = 38
Number of pictures remaining = Total pictures taken - Number of pictures deleted
Number of pictures remaining = 58 - 38
Number of pictures remaining = 20

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: The florist starts with 5 roses.

Step 2: She sells 3 of them, so we need to subtract 3 from 5 to find out how many roses she has left after selling 3 of them.
5 - 3 = 2

Step 3: After selling 3 roses, she picks 14 more. We need to add 14 to the number of roses she had left (2) to find out the total number of roses she has now.
2 + 14 = 16

Step 4: Now we have the total number of roses the florist has after picking 14 more.

Step 2: Determine the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.
Number of sodas per shelf = 6

Step 3: Divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf to find out how many shelves Cody would fill up.

To find the total number of groups that can be made, we need to find the total number of students (boys and girls) and divide it by the number of students in each group (9).

Step 1: Find the total number of students.
Total number of boys = 26
Total number of girls = 46
Total number of students = Total number of boys + Total number of girls
= 26 + 46
= 72

Step 2: Divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group.
Number of students in each group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students in each group
= 72 / 9
= 8

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we can make 8 groups with 9 students in each group. The remaining students will be 0 because 72 is perfectly divisible by 9.

To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to calculate the total number of apples ordered and then subtract the number of apples given to the students.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of apples ordered.
The cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples.
Total apples ordered = 6 + 15 = 21

Step 2: Calculate the number of apples given to the students.
Only 5 students wanted fruit, but we don't know how many apples each student got. However, since the problem mentions both red and green apples, we can assume that the students got a mix of both. We can't determine the exact number of apples given to the students, but we can calculate the maximum number of apples that could have been given to the students.

Let's assume each student got one apple (either red or green). In this case, the maximum number of apples given to the students would be 5.

Step 3: Calculate the number of extra apples the cafeteria ended up with.
To find the number of extra apples, we need to subtract the maximum number of apples given to the students from the total number of apples ordered.

Extra apples = Total apples ordered - Maximum apples given to the students
= 21 - 5
= 16

However, the problem statement implies that the cafeteria might have given out fewer apples to the students. In that case, the number of extra apples would be greater than 16.

Since we can't determine the exact number of apples given to the students, we can't provide a more precise answer.

Step 2: They sold 3 books from the bin. 
Number of books sold = 3
Remaining number of books in the bin = 4 - 3 = 1

Step 3: Then, they put 10 more books in the bin.
New number of books added = 10
Total number of books in the bin now = Remaining number of books in the bin + New number of books added

- Mike made 42 dollars.
- He spent 10 dollars on new mower blades.
- Money left = Initial money - Money spent
- Money left = 42 - 10
- Money left = 32 dollars

Step 2: Determine how many 8 dollar games Mike can buy with the money he has left.
- To find out how many games Mike can buy, we need to divide the money left by the cost of each game.
- Number of games = Money left / Cost of each game
- Number of games = 32 / 8
- Number of games = 4

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the total number of potatoes the chef needs to cook.
The chef needs to cook! 13 potatoes. Since the exclamation mark is likely a typo and should be an asterisk (*), we will assume it is! 13, which is not a standard mathematical notation. However, based on the context, it seems to be a typo and the chef needs to cook 13 potatoes. 

Step 2: Calculate the number of potatoes the chef still needs to cook.
The chef has already cooked 5 potatoes. To find the number of potatoes left, we subtract 5 from 13.
13 - 5 = 8

Step 3: Determine the time it takes to cook one potato.
Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

Step 4: Calculate the total time it will take to cook the remaining potatoes.
Since the chef needs to cook 8 potatoes and each potato takes 6 minutes, we multiply the number of potatoes by the cooking time.
8 * 6 = 48 minutes

Therefore, it will take the chef 48 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded:
   Olivia uploaded 5! pictures from her phone and 35; pictures from her camera.
   First, let's calculate the total number of pictures. However, we need to clarify the notation used.
   In this context, '!' and ';' are likely used to represent the number of pictures, but in the standard mathematical notation, '!' is used to represent factorial (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120).
   However, since we are given the total number of pictures from the phone and camera separately, we can simply add them together.
   Let's assume that the number of pictures is simply 5 and 35, without considering the factorial notation.
   Total pictures = 5 + 35 = 40

2. Since Olivia sorted the pictures into 8 different albums with the same amount of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by 8 to find the number of pictures in each album:
   Number of pictures in each album = Total pictures / 8
   Number of pictures in each album = 40 / 8

3. Perform the division:
   Number of pictures in each album = 40 / 8 = 5

Therefore, {The final answer is} 5.<|eot_id|>",5,5.0,5.0

To find out how many baggies Robin can make, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she has and then divide it by the number of cookies in each baggie.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies Robin has.
She has 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies. 
Total cookies = 23 + 25 = 48

Step 2: Divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in each baggie.
Number of cookies in each baggie = 6
Number of baggies = Total cookies / Number of cookies in each baggie
= 48 / 6
= 8

Since we can't make a fraction of a baggie, we can make 8 baggies with the cookies she has.

To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the amount of money Cody has after receiving the birthday money and spending on the new game.

Step 1: Cody initially has $45.

Step 2: He receives $9 more for his birthday, so we add this to his initial amount:
$45 + $9 = $54

Step 3: Then, he spends $19 on a new game, so we subtract this from the total amount he had after receiving the birthday money:
$54 - $19 = $35

Therefore, Cody has $35 now.

- They ate 8 pieces of candy.

Step 3: Calculate the number of candies they have left.
- Total candies initially = 31
- Candies eaten = 8

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The pet store initially had 88 puppies.

2. They sold 34 puppies in one day. To find out how many puppies are left, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the initial number:

88 (initial puppies) - 34 (puppies sold) = 54 puppies left

3. The problem states that the rest of the puppies were put into cages with 6 puppies in each cage. To find out how many cages were used, we need to divide the number of puppies left by the number of puppies in each cage:

54 (puppies left) ÷ 6 (puppies per cage) = 9

So, the pet store used 9 cages.

To find the total number of trips Jerry will make, we need to first calculate the total number of trays he needs to pick up.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of trays Jerry needs to pick up.
- From the first table, he needs to pick up 9 trays.
- From the second table, he needs to pick up 7 trays.
Total trays = 9 + 7 = 16 trays

Step 2: Determine the number of trays Jerry can carry in one trip.
Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time.

Step 3: Calculate the number of trips Jerry will make to carry all the trays.
Since Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, we need to divide the total number of trays by 8 and round up to the nearest whole number (because he can't make a fraction of a trip).
Number of trips = Total trays / 8
= 16 / 8
= 2

However, since Jerry needs to pick up 16 trays and can carry 8 trays at a time, he will make 2 trips with 8 trays each time, but he will still have 0 trays left over on the second trip.

So, Jerry will make 2 trips.

- Each treasure is worth 7 points.
- So, the points earned from the first level = 2 * 7 = 14 points.

Step 2: Calculate the points earned from the second level.
- Faye found 6 treasures on the second level.
- Each treasure is worth 7 points.
- So, the points earned from the second level = 6 * 7 = 42 points.

Step 3: Calculate the total points earned from both levels.
- Total points = points from the first level + points from the second level
- Total points = 14 + 42
- Total points = 56

Therefore, Faye's score would be 56 points.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Will had left after buying new mower blades.

Will made 104 dollars mowing lawns over the summer.
He spent 41 dollars buying new mower blades.

To find out how much money he had left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he made:

104 (total amount made) - 41 (amount spent) = 63

So, Will had 63 dollars left.

Step 2: Calculate how many 9-dollar games Will could buy with the money he had left.

To find out how many games he could buy, we need to divide the amount of money he had left by the cost of each game:

63 (amount of money left) ÷ 9 (cost of each game) = 7

Since we can't buy a fraction of a game, we round down to the nearest whole number.

To find out how many boxes Luke had to use, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of games Luke had left after selling 39 of them.
Luke started with 57 games and sold 39, so we subtract 39 from 57:
57 - 39 = 18

Step 2: Determine the number of games that can fit in one box.
Luke packed 2 games into each box.

Step 3: Calculate the number of boxes needed to pack the remaining games.
To find the number of boxes, we divide the number of games left (18) by the number of games that can fit in one box (2):
18 ÷ 2 = 9

Therefore, Luke had to use 9 boxes.

To find out how much Emily spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the flowers she bought.

Step 1: Determine the cost of one rose and one daisy.
Since each flower is $3, the cost of one rose and one daisy is $3 + $3 = $6.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of flowers Emily bought.
Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies, so she bought a total of 2 + 2 = 4 flowers.

Step 3: Multiply the cost of one flower by the total number of flowers to find the total cost.
The total cost is $6 (cost of one flower) * 4 (total number of flowers) = $24.

Therefore, Emily spent $24.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of carrots picked by Faye and her mom.
Faye picked 23 carrots, and her mom picked 5 carrots. 
Total carrots = Faye's carrots + Mom's carrots = 23 + 5 = 28

Step 2: Identify the number of good carrots.
It is given that only 12 carrots were good.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bad carrots.
To find the number of bad carrots, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots.

                    question:
                     While playing a trivia game, Frank answered 3 questions correct in the first half, and 2 questions correct in the second half. If each question was worth 3 points, what, was his final score?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find Frank's final score, we need to calculate the total points he earned from both halves of the game. 

Step 1: Calculate the points earned in the first half.
Frank answered 3 questions correct in the first half, and each question was worth 3 points.
Points earned in the first half = 3 questions * 3 points/question = 9 points

Step 2: Calculate the points earned in the second half.
Frank answered 2 questions correct in the second half, and each question was worth 3 points.
Points earned in the second half = 2 questions * 3 points/question = 6 points

Step 3: Calculate the total points earned in the game.
Total points = points earned in the first half + points earned in the second half
Total points = 9 points + 6 points = 15 points

Therefore, Frank's final score was 15 points.

                     Zoe was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 8 boxes of clothing and inside each box. there were ; 4 scarves and 6 mittens.! How many pieces of winter clothing did Zoe have total?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing Zoe has, we need to calculate the total number of scarves and mittens separately and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of scarves.
There are 8 boxes, and each box contains 4 scarves.
Total scarves = Number of boxes * Number of scarves per box
Total scarves = 8 * 4
Total scarves = 32

Step 2: Calculate the total number of mittens.
There are 8 boxes, and each box contains 6 mittens.
Total mittens = Number of boxes * Number of mittens per box
Total mittens = 8 * 6
Total mittens = 48

Step 3: Add the total number of scarves and mittens to find the total number of pieces of winter clothing.
Total winter clothing = Total scarves + Total mittens
Total winter clothing = 32 + 48
Total winter clothing = 80

To find out how much Frank and his friend spent on the trick decks, we need to calculate the total cost of the decks they bought.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the decks Frank bought.
Frank bought 3 decks at $7 each, so the cost of the decks he bought is:
3 decks * $7/deck = $21

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the decks his friend bought.
His friend bought 2 decks at $7 each, so the cost of the decks his friend bought is:
2 decks * $7/deck = $14

Step 3: Calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the decks Frank bought and the cost of the decks his friend bought.
Total cost = $21 (Frank's decks) + $14 (his friend's decks) = $35

Therefore, Frank and his friend spent a total of $35 on the trick decks.

                    question:
                     Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts. before school.. If ; he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not : wash?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find out how many shirts Sam did not wash, we need to determine how many shirts he was supposed to wash in total and then subtract the number of shirts he actually washed.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of shirts Sam had to wash.
Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts.
Total shirts = 40 (short sleeve) + 23 (long sleeve) = 63 shirts.

Step 2: Determine the number of shirts Sam actually washed.
Sam washed 29 shirts by the time school started.

Step 3: Subtract the number of shirts Sam actually washed from the total number of shirts to find out how many he did not wash.
Shirts not washed = Total shirts - Shirts washed
Shirts not washed = 63 - 29

Step 4: Perform the subtraction to find the final answer.
Shirts not washed = 34

                    question:
                     A waiter had 47 : customers to wait on. If 41 customers left and he got another 20 customers, how many customers would he have?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find the final number of customers the waiter has, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Subtract the number of customers who left (41) from the initial number of customers (47) to find out how many customers are left.

47 (initial customers) - 41 (customers who left) = 6

Step 2: Add the number of new customers (20) to the remaining customers (6) to find the final number of customers.

6 (remaining customers) + 20 (new customers) = 26

Step 3: The final number of customers is the result from step 2.

Therefore, the waiter would have 26 customers.
