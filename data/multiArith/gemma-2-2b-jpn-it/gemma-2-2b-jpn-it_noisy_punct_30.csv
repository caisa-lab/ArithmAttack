**Here's how to solve this step-by-step:**

1. **Identify the Key information:**
   - Emily started with 41 seeds.
   - She planted 29 seeds in the big garden.
   - She planted 4 seeds in each small garden.

2. **Understand the Given Problem:**
   Our goal is to figure out how many small gardens Emily has.

   - We know how many seeds were planted in the big garden, and we can find out how many seeds were planted in the small gardens by subtracting them from the total seeds.

4. **Solve for the unknown:**
   - Total seeds in small gardens = Total seeds - seeds in big garden.

5 **Apply the information from the problem to the equation:**
   - Number of small gardens = Total seeds in small gardens / Seeds in each small garden
   - Number of small gardens = (41 - 29) seeds / 4 seeds/garden

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1.  Identify the unknown.**  We want to find out how many files are left after Vanessa deleted 30. The unknown is the number of remaining music files.

**2.  Figure out the starting value.**  Vanessa starts with 16 music files.

**3.  Determine the change.** Vanessa deleted 30 music files.

**4.  Calculate the remaining files.**  To find the number of remaining music files, we remove the deleted files from the original amount: 16 - 30 =  -14

**5.  Re-examine your answer.** The answer is negative, meaning Vanessa no longer had any music files left.

Here's the breakdown of our problem-solving process:

**1. Understand the problem:**

    *  Dave needs to wash 9 short sleeve shirts + 27 long sleeve shirts = 36 shirts total.
    *   He only washed 20 of the shirts.
    *  We need to find out how many shirts he didn't wash.

**2. Set up an equation:**

    *  Let 'x' represent the number of shirts Dave didn't wash.
    *  The equation is:  Total shirts - Shirts washed = Shirts not washed 
    *  This can be simplified as: 36 - 20 = x 

**3. Solve for x:**

    *  36 - 20 = 16

Step 1: Start by finding the total number of puppies brought in. 
Step 2: Then, find the total number of puppies after they were brought in. 
Step 3:  Calculate the number of days needed to adopt all the puppies. 
 


Let's break down the solution:

**Step 1: Find the total number of puppies brought in.**
   * The initial number of puppies was 2.

* **Step 3:** Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the given and unknown information.
* **Step 4:** Solve for the unknown quantity.
* **Step 5:** State the conclusion.
* **Step 6:** End with the final answer.


Let's break it down:

**Step 1:** Identify the given information.

* Maria bought 35 green towels and 21 white towels.
* Maria gave 34 towels to her mother.


**Step 2:** State the unknown quantity.

* We need to find out how many towels Maria has left.


**Step 3:** Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the given and unknown information.

Let's use variables: 
*  Let 'g' be the number of green towels
*  Let 'w' be the number of white towels 

We can write the equation based on the given information:
g + w = 35 + 21 


**Step 4:** Solve for the unknown quantity. 

*  Combine the green and white towels to find the total
* This gives us: g + w = 56

*  Since Maria gave 34 towels to her mother, we need to subtract the numbers we gave to her mother from the initial amount 
* This is written as: g + w - 34 = 56 - 34
* This gives us: g + w - 34 = 22

**Step 5:** State the conclusion.


* We have the equation g + w = 22 
* This means that Maria has 22 towels left.


**Step 6:** End with the final answer.

*Note: This problem involves a combination of basic arithmetic and number systems.*

**Solution:**


1. **Identify the information:** 
   * We know the pet store has 6 bird cages.
   * Each cage has 2 parrots + 7 parakeets.

2. **Set up the variables:**
   * Let 'p' represent the total number of parrots.
   * Let  'q' represent the total number of parakeets.

3. **Formulate the equations:**
   * We know the total number of birds is calculated by adding the number of parrots and the number of parakeets.
   * We can write this as an equation: p + q = Total number of birds
   * We can express the number of birds in each cage as a formula and add those numbers to get the total 
   * 
4. **Solve for the variables:**

5. **Calculate the total number of parrots:**
   * Total parrots (p) = number of parrots * number of cages
   * Total parrots = 2 parrots/cage * 6 cages = 12 parrots 
   
6. **Calculate the total number of parakeets:**
   * Total parakeets (q) = number of parakeets / number of cages * 
   * Total parakeets = 7 parakeets/cage * 6 cages = 42 parakeets 

7. **Calculate the total number of birds**
   * Total birds = parrots + parakeets
   * Total birds = 12 parrots + 42 parakeets = 54 birds

3. **Add the new customers:** The waiter got 20 more customers so we add that to the remaining customers. 6 + 20 = 26 customers. 


{The final answer is 26}
