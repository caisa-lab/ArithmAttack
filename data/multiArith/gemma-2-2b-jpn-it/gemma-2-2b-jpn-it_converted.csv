                     Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Start with the initial number of songs:** Paige began with 11 songs.

**Solution**

1. **Find the total number of seeds planted in the small gardens.** 
   * Emily planted 4 seeds in each small garden, and she planted 29 seeds in the big garden.
   * This means she planted 29 + 4 * x = seeds in other gardens. 
   where x is the number of small gardens.

2. **Set the equation equal to the number of seeds in the small gardens.** 
  * She started with 41 seeds, so she must have planted 41 total.

3. **Solve for x (the number of small gardens).**
   * We can use our equation from step 1, 29 + 4x = 41. 
   * Subtract 29 from both sides. 4x = 12
   * Divide both sides by 4. x = 3.
   
 

**The final answer is:** Emily has 3 small gardens.

                    question:
                     While playing at the arcade, Frank won 33 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 9 tickets playing 'skee ball'. If he was trying to buy candy that cost 6 tickets a piece, how many could he buy?<end_of_turn>
*Bonus question:* If Frank then had to pay 15 tickets for a toy car, how many pieces of candy could he buy after that purchase?


Here's how I solved the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of tickets Frank has.**

* Frank won 33 tickets from 'whack a mole' + 9 tickets from 'skee ball'.
* This means he has 33 + 9 = 42 tickets.
 
**Step 2: Determine how many candies he can buy.**

* Each candy costs 6 tickets. 
* He has 42 tickets. 
* To find out how many candies he can buy, divide his total tickets by the cost of each candy: 42 tickets / 6 tickets/candy = 7 candies.


**Bonus Question:**

**Step 1:  Calculate the remaining tickets.**

* After buying the toy car, Frank has 42 tickets - 15 tickets = 27 tickets
 


**Step 2: Determine how many candies he can buy after the toy car purchase.**

* He has 27 tickets and each candy costs 6 tickets.
* To find out how many candies he can buy, divide his remaining tickets by the cost of each candy: 27 tickets / 6 tickets/candy = 4.5 candies.

**Final Answer:** 
{Frank could buy 7 candies. {  Frank could buy 4.5 candies after paying for the toy car. }

                     At a restaurant each adult meal costs $7 and kids eat free. If a group of 13 people came in and 9 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?<end_of_turn>



Here's the breakdown:

* **Step 1: Identify the number of adults.**  
    *  We know the group has 13 people, and 9 are kids. 
    * So, the number of adults is 13 - 9 = 4 people.

   *  Multiply the cost per adult meal by the number of adults.
   *   $7/meal * 4 meals = $28

* **Step 3:  Determine the total cost.**
    *  Add the cost of adult meals to the cost of the kids meals. 
    *  Since kids eat free, there's no cost for them.

* **Step 4: Find the total cost**
   * Total cost = $28

* Show how many regular sodas fit in a shelf.
* Show how many diet sodas fit in a shelf.
* Calculate the total number of sodas. 
* Determine how many shelves need to be filled. 



**Here's the solution:**

1. **Regular sodas per shelf:** 
    - Tom has 4 regular sodas.
    - Each shelf holds 7 sodas.
    - Therefore, the number of regular sodas that can fit in a shelf is 4.

2. **Diet sodas per shelf:**
    - Tom has 52 diet sodas.
    - Each shelf holds 7 diet sodas.
    - Therefore, the number of diet sodas that can fit in a shelf is 52 / 7 = 7.43.
    - Since we can't have fractions of sodas per shelf, we round down to 7. 

3. **Total number of sodas:**
    - There are 4 regular sodas.
    - There are 7 diet sodas.
    - This means the total number of sodas is 4 + 7 = 11.

4. **Shelves to fill:**
    - He needs 11 sodas in total.
    - Each shelf holds 7 sodas.
    - Therefore, Tom needs 11 / 7 = 1.57.

                     A waiter had 22 customers in his section. If 14 of them left and the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table, how many tables did he have?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Understand the problem:** We need to calculate how many tables the waiter had, given that some original customers left and the remaining customers filled the tables at each remaining table.

2. **Calculate the number of customers remaining:**  The waiter had 22 customers initially, and 14 left. So,  22 - 14 = 8 customers remained.

3. **Determine the number of tables**   Since each table holds 4 people, and the remaining customers fill the tables, he had 8 customers divided by 4 people per table.
  So,  8 / 4 = 2 tables.
 
4. **The final answer is:** The waiter had 2 tables.

Here's how we can work this out:

**2. Determine the realistic number of bouquets Isabel can make.**

*  Since Isabel can't make half a bouquet, round down to the nearest whole number. Thus, Isabel can make 8 bouquets. 



**3. Calculate the number of bouquets left after the wilted flowers.**

* Since 10 flowers wilted, subtract them from the initial number of flowers: 66 flowers - 10 flowers = 56 flowers. 

**4. Determine the number of bouquets she can make now.**

                     Wendy bought 4 new chairs and 4 new tables for her house. If she spent 6 minutes on each piece furniture putting it together, how many minutes did it take her to finish?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to solve:

**Step 1:  Identify the number of items.**

* Wendy bought 4 chairs.
* She bought 4 tables.

**Step 2:  Calculate the total time spent.**

*  Time per chair: 6 minutes
*  Time per table: 6 minutes

**Step 3:  Multiply the time per item by the number of items.**

* Time per chair * Number of chairs = Total time per chair
* Total time per chair = 6 minutes * 4 chairs = 24 minutes.
* The same logic applies to the tables.
* Total time per table = 6 minutes * 4 tables = 24 minutes.

**Step 4: Add the total time for each item.**

* Total time = Total time per chair + Total time per table
* Total time = 24 minutes + 24 minutes = 48 minutes .

**The final answer is: 48 minutes**
