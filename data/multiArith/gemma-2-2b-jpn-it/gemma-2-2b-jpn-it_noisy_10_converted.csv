**Solution:**
*Step 1: Identify the given information.* 
   - Each enemy defeated gives 9 points.
   - There are 11 enemies total.
   - You destroy all but 3 of them.

*Step 2: Determine the unknown value.*

*The problem

**Solution:**
Step 1: **Identify the information needed.**  To find how much money April earned, we need to know how many roses she had *before* the sale and how many were left after the sale.

Step 2: **Determine starting number of roses.** We know April started with 13 roses.

{The final answer is 1 hour}


**Solution:**
1. **Identify the information:**
    *  The building needs 9 windows.
    *  The builder has already installed 6 windows.
    
2. **Determine the number of windows to be installed:**
    *  Total windows needed - windows installed = windows remaining 
    *  9 windows - 6 windows = 3 windows remaining

3. **Calculate the total time required:**
    *  Time per window * number of windows to be installed = total time
    *  6 hours/window * 3 windows = 18 hours 

4. **Determine the final time to install the remaining windows:**

* Subtract the apples given to students: 96 - 42 = 54 apples 

**Step 2: Determine the number of pies that can be made.**
* Each pie needs 6 apples.
* Divide the remaining apples by the number of apples per pie: 54 apples / 6 apples/pie = 9 pies.

**Step 3: State the answer**
* They could make 9 pies.

.


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

    5. **State the Answer:**  Place the final answer in a clear and concise way.

 


Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a trivia team with 5 members.
   - 2 members didn't show up.
   - Each member who did show up scored 6 points.
   - We need to find the total number of points scored.

**2. Define Variables:**
   - Let 'S' represent the total number of points scored.
   - Let 'm' represent the number of members that were present.

**3. Calculate:**
   - We know 2 members didn't show up, so 'm' = 5 - 2 = 3 members.
   - Each present member scores 6 points, so S = 6 * m 
   - S = 6 * 3
   - S = 18

 

**4. Check for Validity:**
The calculated value of 18 represents the total points scored.


**5. State the Answer: **
The final answer is {18 points} .

*

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Total cooked wings:**  The chef started with 8 wings and cooked 10 more, so they have a total of 8 + 10 = 18 wings.

2. **Sharing the wings:** Since they got the same amount, they each need to share equally from the 18 wings. 

3. **Wings per person:** To find out how much each person receives, we divide the total number of wings by the number of people: 18 wings / 3 people = 6 wings per person.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Start with the initial number of socks:** John begins with 33 socks.

2. **Subtract the old socks:**  He throws away 19 old socks, so we subtract that from the initial number. 33 - 19 = 14 socks left.

3. **Add the new socks:** John buys 13 new socks, so we add that to the remaining socks. 14 + 13 = 27 socks.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

*Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.*

The problem tells us:  
*   The pet store has 6 bird cages.
*   Each cage has 2 parrots and 7 parakeets.


*Step 2: Determine the relationship between the different types of birds.*

This means there are two relationships:
* One with parrots 
* One with parakeets.


*Step 3: Set up an equation to find the total number of birds.*

Let: 
*  p  represent the number of parrots
*  p  represent the number of parakeets

We can set up an equation:

6 cages * (2 parrots + 7 parakeets) = total birds


*Step 4: Solve the equation for the total number of birds.*

*Convert the expression:
6 cages * (2 parrots + 7 parakeets) = total birds 
6 cages * (2p + 7q) = total birds

*Now, we have to simplify to solve*

Total birds = 6 cages * (2p + 7q)

                    question:
                     Isabel picked 66 flowers ! for ; her friend’s wedding. She was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. If ? 10 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of bouquets Isabel can make.**

*  Isabel can make bouquets with 8 flowers each.
*  She has 66 flowers. 
* Total bouquets: 66 flowers / 8 flowers/bouquet = 8.25 bouquets. 


**Step 2: Account for the number of wilted flowers.** 

* She started with 66 flowers.
* 10 flowers wilted.  
*  Flowers counted towards bouquets: 66 flowers - 10 flowers = 56 flowers.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of bouquets Isabel can still make.**

*  Isabel can make bouquets with 8 flowers each. 
*  She has 56 flowers.
* Total bouquets: 56 flowers / 8 flowers/bouquet = 7 bouquets

                    question:
                     Wendy bought 4 new chairs and 4 new tables for her house. ; If she spent 6 minutes on each piece furniture putting it together, how many minutes did it take her to finish?<end_of_turn>


Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the objects:** Wendy bought 4 chairs and 4 tables.
2. **Determine the time for each item:** She spent 6 minutes assembling each chair and table.
3. **Calculate the total time for all items:**
   *  To assemble her chairs, she spent 4 chairs * 6 minutes/chair = 24 minutes.
   *  To assemble her tables, she spent 4 tables * 6 minutes/table = 24 minutes.
   *  Therefore, she spent a total of 24 minutes + 24 minutes = 48 minutes on chairs and tables.

4. **Answer the question:** It took Wendy 48 minutes to finish assembling all the furniture.

*Bonus points* explain why the problem is tricky. 

**Solution:**

1. **Find the total number of games purchased:**
   * Ned bought 50 games from his friend + 27 more at the garage sale = 77 games.

2. **Find the number of good games:**
   *  He had 77 games and 74 didn't work.  
   * Therefore, he has 77 - 74 = 3 good games.

{The final answer is 3} 
 


**Why the Problem is Tricky:**

Here's why this problem presents a tricky situation: You might initially be tempted to focus on the direct steps:

* **Addition of purchases:** You add the initial number from the friend and the new one at the garage sale. 
* **Subtraction of non-functional games:** You subtract the number of non-functional games.


However, understanding that you need to find the number of *good* games and working out that the solution is directly based on the difference between purchases and non-functional ones poses an analytical challenge.

*Step 1:*  Identify the starting number of each type of cat. 
*Step 2:* Calculate the number of each type of cat sold.
*Step 3:* Subtract the number of cats sold from the starting number of each type of cat.
*Step 4:* State the final answer. 


**Solution**
*Step 1:* The pet store begins with 38 Siamese cats and 25 house cats. We can note these numbers in variables.  
Let : 
   *  x = the number of Siamese cats
   *  y = the number of house cats
 
*Step 2:*  They sold 45 cats. This means:
   * x - 45 = number of Siamese cats left 
   * y - 45 = number of house cats left

*Step 3:* To find the number of cats left, Subtract the number of cats sold from each type of cat, we have 
   * x - 45 = 38 - 45 
   * y - 45 = 25 - 45
*Step 4:*  Find the final answer.
