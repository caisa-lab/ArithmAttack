*  Let `a` represent the number of adult meals.
*  Let `k` represent the number of kids' meals.

* Substitute k = 2 into the first equation: `a + 2 = 11`
* Subtract 2 from both sides: `a = 9`

**4. Calculate the total cost:**
* The cost of each adult meal is $8, so the total cost for `a` (adult meals) is `9 * $8 = $72`

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the problem:**  Will has 59 pieces of clothing to wash. He put some in one large load and the rest in 9 smaller loads. We need to figure out how many pieces go in each of the smaller loads.

2. **Calculate the number of pieces in the large load:** The problem states he put 32 pieces in one large load.

3. **Calculate the number of pieces left:**  Subtract the pieces in the big load from the total number of pieces: 59 - 32 = 27 pieces.

                     The school cafeteria had 14 apples. If they used ; 13 to make lunch for the students and then bought 49 more, how many apples would they have?<end_of_turn>
*

Here's how we can solve it:

1. **Start with the initial amount:**  The cafeteria began with 14 apples.

2. **Subtract the apples used:** They used 13 apples for lunch so we subtract that from the starting amount. 14 - 13 = 1 apple left.

3. **Add the new apples:** They bought 49 more apples, so we add those to the remaining apples. 1 + 49 = 50 apples.


{The final answer is 50}
