Let's break down the problem step by step:

**1.  Understand the Information Given:**
   * We know there were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the basketball team. 
   * We need to find how many students didn't make the cut.
   * We know that 26 out of the total number of participants got called back.

**2.  Calculate the total number of students:**
   * We know there are 39 girls + 4 boys = total participants
   * We don't need these numbers in the final answer, as they are just data for understanding. 


**3.  Determine the number of students who did not make the cut:**
   * Since only 26 out of the 39 girls + 4 boys were called back, then there were 39 girls + 4 boys - 26  = the number  of students who didn't make the cut.


**Answer:**  {The total number of students who didn't make the cut was 13.}

                    :  : April's ? discount flowers : was . having a sale ? where each ! rose ? was 4 dollars. ! If April started . with 13 ? roses and had . 4 roses ? left, . how , much ! money did she earn?<end_of_turn>
* **Step 1: What information do we need to solve this problem?** 
 * We need to know: 
	 * The discount percentage. 
	 * How many roses she started with.
	 * How many roses she had left.
	 *  The cost of one rose at the original price. 


* **Step 2: Formulate an equation based on the provided information.**

*Let `x` be the percentage discount.*
*April's earnings = The price of the roses * The number of roses she started with, -  The price of the roses she sold. *


* **Step 3: Solve the equation.**
 * April started with 13 roses.  Let's imagine that 4 roses are the result of the sale, the price is *4*.
* She has 4 roses left.   * 4 roses = 4*4
     
* **Step 4:  Determine a relationship between the variables.**
    * The number of roses sold can be expressed as 
   * 13 - 4 = 9 roses   


* **Step 5:  Determine the relationship between quantities.**



Let's say that `x` is the percentage discount. 
Here's how that might look. April starts with 13 roses. Her sale results in her selling 9 roses.  * 

Let's say that *x* is the percentage discount.  Here's how that might look. 

* **Step 6: Determine how much money we earned.**


We can use the information from *Step 5* and *Step 4* to calculate how much money April earned. 
 

* **Step 7:  Calculate the Earnings.**



{The final answer is 0}.



**You're really close! Just a few minor errors in the steps and explanations.**

Let me go through the problem again. We can use equations to figure this out:

**Step 1: What information do we need to solve this problem?**
* Discount percentage (x)
* Number of roses April started with 13
* Number of roses before the discount (after the sale) 4 
* The cost of one rose at the original price $4
* The number of roses left after the sale

**Step 2: Formulate an equation**
   
   * Let *x* represent the percentage discount.
   * Original price per rose = $4
   * Total earnings before discount = (number of roses * price per rose) 
   * Total earnings after discount = (number of roses * new price per rose) 
   * Total earnings can be represented as * (number of roses * original price per rose)  - (number of roses * new price per rose)* 
 


**Let's calculate to solve for earnings.**

* The number of roses after the discount = 9 * $4

**Step 3: Solve the equation**

* The number of roses after the discount = 9* $4 = $36


**Final answer:** 0

**Step 1:** Identify the problem and its key elements.

*   **Problem:**  A man named Ned had to wash a certain number of short-sleeved and long-sleeved shirts before starting school. We know how many of them he washed and we know how many he had in total. We need to know how many of them did he *not* wash before school. 

*   **Key elements:**
    *   **Short-sleeve:**  9 shirts
    *   **Long-sleeve:** 21 shirts
    *   **Total:** 9 + 21 = 30 shirts
    *   **Washed:** 29 shirts 

**Step 2:**  Develop a plan to solve the problem.

*  **Focus:** Work backward from what we know: 
    *   We know Ned washed 29 shirts of the total of 30 shirts.
    *   We want to know how many shirts were *not* washed.
 

**Step 3:  Apply the plan to solve the problem.**

Let's break down this problem:

1. **Number of guests who didn't show up:**
   -  We know the company had 47 people initially. 
   -  7 out of 47 didn't show up. 
   -  So we have: 47 - 7 = 40 people attended.

2. **Number of tables needed**
   - The company had 40 guests. 
   - Each table holds 5 people.
   - We figure out how many tables they need to fit 40.

**Therefore, to round this off, the company needs 8 tables!**

* Step 1: We need to calculate the number of windows that need to be installed. 
     *  The problem states that the building needs 14 windows and the builder has already installed 8 of them.
     Answer: 14 windows - 8 windows = 6 windows
   
* Step 2: We need to calculate the time it will take to install the remaining windows. 
     *  We know it takes 8 hours per window.
     * We need to calculate the number of hours. Total window number - already installed windows = Remaining windows.
     Answer: 6 windows
    

* Step 3: We need to calculate the total time in hours. 
     * We know it takes 8 hours per window to install. 
     * This will require hours = Remaining Windows / Installation time per window.
      Answer: 6 windows / 8 hours/window

* Step 4:  We need to simplify. 
     * 6 windows / 8 hours/window = 1.5 hours

 { The final answer is} 1.5  hours.




The provided answer is incorrect and there are some errors in logic. We can refine the solution as follows:
 

* **Step 1: Calculate the number of windows to be installed.**
   Initial windows: 14
   Installed: 8
   Uninstalled: 14 - 8 = 6

* **Step 2: Calculate the time to install the remaining windows.**
   Installation time = Number of remaining windows * Time to install each window
   Installation time = 6 windows * 8 hours/window = 48 hours 

* **Step 3: We need to calculate the time it will take the builder to complete the entire task.**
  
   Since the number of remaining windows is 6, and it takes 8 hours to install each window, it will take the builder * 6 windows * 8 hours/window = 48 hours. 
  



{ The final answer is} 48 hours .
 



 **Explanation of Errors and Corrections**
 
The original solution made a key error in Step 3. It incorrectly assumed the time was 6 *8 * 8 hours/ window = 384 hours when it actually equates to 48 hours with the above explanation.

The improved solution makes sure that all calculations are accurate and logical.

      - 21 new oranges are added to the bin. 

2. **Clarifying the Question:**
   - The problem is asking us to calculate the final count of oranges in the bin. We are given this with details of the oranges being added and removed.  

3. **The Calculation**

   - The total count changes due to the oranges being added and removed:
      -  Oranges remaining from the beginning were 40. 
      -  25 of the oldest oranges were thrown out.
      -   21 new oranges were added to the bin. 

4. **Final Answer**

   -  40 - 25 + 21 = { 36 oranges }

*Please remember this is a time, not a math problem* 

Let's understand the problem step by step:

1. **Initial puppies:** The shelter starts with ""5 puppies.""  
   * Consider this our starting point. 

2. **Adding puppies:** The shelter receives another 35 puppies.
   * Think of this as increasing the total number. 

3. **Daily Adoption Rate:** The shelter figures out the rate at which they can adopt puppies. 8 puppies are adopted daily
   * This is our ""time frame.""

4. **Calculating Time:**  To find out how long it takes to adopt all the puppies, we need to: 
   * Determine the total number of puppies.
   * Figure out how many puppies are adopted per day.
   * Divide the number of puppies (added plus the starting ones)  to the number of puppies adopted per day. {The problem has a very specific rate at which they adopt and then uses a simple addition formula.

The final answer is {It would take 4 days.}

Here's the breakdown of the solution:

1. **Understand the Relationships:** 
   - The analogy is about how to relate the given information to the problem.
   - We have an analogy about new building requiring new windows, and having enough for all the windows needed.

2. **Identify Key Information:**
   - A new building needs 9 windows.
   - The builder installed 6 of the windows.

3. **Determine  the  ""Rest"" of the Problem:**
   - We need to figure out how many windows he has to install.
   - He needs to install 9 - 6 = 3 windows.


4. **Consider Time and Efficiency:**
   - The builder installs 1 window every 6 hours. 
   
5. **Calculate the Time:**
   - 3 window needs * 6 hours per window = 18 hours

This problem requires us to break down the problem into smaller pieces. We're then going to apply math to each part.

Here's our solution:

**Step 1. Define the unknowns:**

* Let 'a' represent the number of adult meals.
* Since kids eat for free, their meals are not taken into account, we know that $7 * a = 7*a

**Step 2. Set up the equation reflecting the numbers given**

* We know there are 13 people in total:  We have the adults: 13 people - 9 kids = 4 adults. * We have that $7 * a = 7 * a

**Step 3. Solve for the number of adult meals (a):**
We know that the total number of people the group is comprised of is 13, and 9 of those are kids (free meals).  * We want to figure out how many food groups there are. 
 a = 13 - 9 
 A = 4

**Step 4. Calculate the total cost:**
To find total cost, we use the equation given:
  
 * Cost of adult meals * number of adult meals = total cost of meals
  
 * $7 * 4 =  28

 {The final answer is 28}    
   
 
  
  
**Explanations:**  
 * We use simple mathematical operations (addition, subtraction) and multiplication to solve for each variable. 
 *  Identifying what these variables represent helps us solve the problem.

*You are expected to take on the role of the problem-solving assistant.*

Let's break this problem down into smaller, manageable steps.

1. **Starting Point:**  We know Adam began with 48 books. 

2. **Selling Books:** He sold 19 books, so let's subtract that from the initial amount. The number after he sold books is 48-19 = 29.

3. **Using the Money:** Now Adam likely earned enough to buy 38 additional books. Let's represent how much money this amount would be.

4. **Unknown Information:** We are missing the amount of money Adam earned from selling the books. This is an essential part of the problem, and without knowing the earnings we cannot conclude the final answer. 
 * 

 Let's work back on the initial information. 


 



 
{The final answer is 29 + 38 = 67} 

**Please remember that this solution makes a lot of assumptions. We could have very limited information and not be able to arrive at a definitive answer. 
This solution hinges on the premise that the additional books were acquired using the earnings from the original set, which is a key piece of information assumed by the solutions logic. It assumes that the money is used for new books.

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     : For ? Halloween ! Bianca received 78 , pieces of candy. ; She ate ; 30 . pieces then placed . the rest into ! piles : with ? 8 in , each pile. How ! many ! piles could she : make?<end_of_turn>
*The step-by-step process is as follows:*
1. **Identify the given information** : It states that Bianca received 78 pieces of candy. It also states that she ate 30 pieces and has the rest in piles with 8 pieces in each pile. 
2. **Calculate the number of pieces remaining** : The number of pieces Bianca has remaining is 78 - 30 = 48 pieces.
3. **Identify the number of desired pile (number of piles):** Bianca has 48 / 8 = 6 piles, since each pile can hold 8 candies.
4. **State the final answer**  
{The final answer is 6 piles}


We did solve this with understanding each, and step and showing our reasoning but let's look at an alternate method 
* **Alternate Method:*

1. **Identify the given information:**  Bianca received 78 pieces of candy and ate 30, leaving her with 78 - 30 = 48 pieces. She wants to divide those pieces evenly among piles. 
2. **Determine the container capacity:** The containers for the candy can hold 8 pieces.   
3. **Calculate the number of containers:**  Since Bianca has 48 pieces to divide, we can divide that number evenly by the container capacity (8 pieces): 48 / 8 = 6 containers. **Final answer:** { The final answer is 6 containers}




Let's work through the alternate method, to see the reasoning for the steps:

**Alternate method reasoning:** 

**1. Given information:** 
   * 78 pieces of candy were received
   * 30 pieces were eaten
   * 48 pieces remaining
   * Each pile holds 8 pieces

 **2. Determine container capacity:** 
   * The container capacity (or number of pieces per container) is 8. 

**3. Calculate the number of containers: **
   * 48 (remaining) pieces divide evenly by 8 pieces per container to get 6 containers as the answer. 


   This method works similarly to the first method; we start with the given information, analyze it and then solve the problem through a series of steps and an appropriate calculation for the answer.

*  **Luke's Starting Inventory:**

First, let's figure out how many games Luke had originally. 

* **Step 1:** We know that starting with 39 games, Luke sold some. The number of games left is the original number minus the number that were sold. His games were reduced by 19, which means his amount of games left is our starting point 39! – 19

Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

**Step 1: Figure out how many students are left after not being picked for the first team.**

* We know 17 students weren't picked for the first team.
* We need to find out how many students were picked in the first place.

   To do this we will use subtraction. 

   (Students picked = Students trying out - Students who weren’t picked)
   (Students picked) = 65 - 17 = 48
   Therefore, 48 students were picked for the first team. 

**Step 2: Determine the number of students remaining after the first team selection.**

*  We were given a number of total students (65) and a number of students picked for the first team (48).

**Step 3: Calculate the number of students in each group or the remaining students **


* We know these students will go into 8 groups. 
* Students remaining =Total students - Students on the first team 
* Remaining students = 65 - 48 = 17 
* Therefore, 17 remaining students are left after the first team selection. 

**Conclusion** 


* **Number of students in each group = Remaining students/ number of groups  **

* Each group will have 17/ 8 = 2.125 students. 



This is an interesting scenario because you cannot have a fraction of a student in a group. 


{The number of students in each group is an answer that won't be achieved in this case due to the way fractions of students work and the need for whole number student counts. }

*Let's solve this!*

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of puppies.**

* We start with 2 puppies added to 34 more:  2 + 34 = 36 puppies 

**Step 2:  Calculate the number of days to adopt all puppies.**

* We determine the time it takes to adopt all 36 puppies 
;


We know there's 4 puppies per day, and we divide that by the number of puppies
* 36 puppies / 4 puppies/day =  9 days

**Final Answer: It would take 9 days for all of the puppies to be adopted!!** {The final answer is 9 days.}

{The answer is}  ...


**Solution**

1. **Flowers by Type:** Katie bought 5 roses and 5 daisies, which is a total of 5 + 5 = 10 flowers.  

2. **Flower Price:** She paid $6 per flower for the roses and $6 per flower for the daisies. To find the cost of the roses, we need to multiply the number of roses by the price per rose: 5 roses * $6/rose = $30 for the roses.  To find the cost of the daisies, we do the same: 5 daisies * $6/daisy = $30 for the daisies.

3. **Total Spent:** Katie’s total spend is the sum of the cost of the roses and the cost of the daisies:  $30 + $30 = $60

## Solution
Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1:  Calculate the number of carrots remaining after throwing some out.**

* Maria started with 48 carrots.
* She threw out 11 carrots, so there are 48 - 11 = 37 carrots left.
 
**Step 2: Calculate the total number of carrots picked the next day.**

* Maria picked 15 more carrots the next day, so she added 15 to the number of carrots remaining. 
* 37 + 15 = 52 carrots

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of carrots Maria has.**

*  Maria starts with 37 carrots and then picks 52 more, giving a total of 37+52 = 89 carrots

* **Step 3:** Use the given information to set up an equation.

* **Step 4:** Solve for the unknown quantity.

* **Step 5:** Interpret the answer in terms of the problem. 

Here's how I solved it:
 

**Step 1: Identify the important information from the problem**
-  Luke had 5 piles of quarters.
-  Luke had 5 piles of dimes.
-  Each pile had 3 coins.  

**Step 2: Define variables to represent the unknown quantities.**
Let:
 - *q* represent the number of quarters 
 - *d* represent the number of dimes 

**Step 3: Use the given information to set up an equation.**
- We know that Luke had 5 piles of quarters. Therefore, 
  *q = 5*
- We know that Luke had 5 piles of dimes. Therefore, 
 *d = 5*
- The problem asks about the total number of coins. We can describe the total number of coins as a sum.

**Step 4: Solve for the unknown quantity.**
Total coins = * (Number of quarters * Number of coins per pile) + (Number of dimes * Number of coins per pile)*
   Total coins = * (5 * 3) + (5 * 3)* 
   Total coins = * 15 + 15*
   Total coins = * 30* 

**Step 5: Interpret the answer in terms of the problem.**
Luke had a total of *30* coins.

Solution:



1. **Ticket cost:** The price of a single ticket was $4.
2. **Cost of the initial three tickets:** Haley bought three tickets, so the cost of those tickets was $4 each * 3 tickets = $12 for the first group of tickets which are only for Haley and her Friends. 
3. **Extra Tickets:** Haley bought 5 extra tickets.
4. **Cost of the extra tickets:** Each of these 5 tickets cost $4 as well, so the cost of these tickets is $4 * 5 = $20 for the extra 5 tickets.
5. **Total cost:** The cost of getting a single ticket in case of tickets for Haley's friends is $12. Haley spent $12 on tickets. and $20 on extra tickets so the total is $12 + $20 = $32.

*Note: I'm aiming to use the correct terminology. Please keep this in mind when you are solving the problem.*

**Here is a breakdown of the problem, so we're on the same page:** 

- We know there are 4 bird cages in the pet store.
- Each cage can hold either 8 parrots or 2 parakeets.
- We have to figure out how many birds the pet store has in total.

**Step 1:** What does the problem ask us to calculate?

   * The problem asks us to calculate the total number of birds in the pet store.

**Step 2:** What information do we have that will help us answer the question? 

   * **Number of cages:** 4
   * **Parrot capacity per cage:** 8
   * **Parakeet capacity per cage:** 2


**Step 3:**  Now, let's think about how we can use the information to figure out the total number of birds.

   * **Assume** we are considering each cage as having the option of housing either parrots OR parakeets 
   * **Then, a bird (whether parrot or parakeet) in a cage is counted as a single bird because these are defined as separate species in the given problem.** 
**
**Here's how I will start to figure out the number of birds:**
* **Total cages:** 4

* **Possible birds per cage =? **   
 * 4 parrots cages: 4 * 8 = 32
 * 4 parakeet cages: 4 * 2 = 8


Therefore, we have a total of 32 + 8 = 40

Let's break the problem down step-by-step:

**Step 1: Define Variables**

* Let 'x' represent the number of bags Maria can make.
* Let 'c' represent the number of chocolate chip cookies per bag.
* Let 'o' represent the number of oatmeal cookies per bag.

**Step 2: Set Up Equations from the Given Information**

*  We know that Maria has 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies: 
   c = 5 + 19  
*  We know that she makes ""c"" cookies per bag: 
   c = cookies per bag  

* We know that she made ? batches of cookies in total:
   x = ? number of batches

* We know that she has ? cookies in total. 
   Cookies = 5 + 19 = 24 cookies in total


**Step 3: Solve for 'c'**

c = 5 + 19 
c = 24 cookies

**Step 4: Solve for 'x'**

* x = ? batches
* c = 24 cookies per batch
* x = Number of batches


 
 **Step 5: Solve for 'o'**
 
*  o = ? number of oatmeal cookies
*  o = 19 cookies per bag


**Step 2: Find the total number of cookie batches Maria can make**

* Multiply the number of cookies she has by the number of batches she can make: 
   Total cookies = 5 chocolate chip cookies + 19 oatmeal cookies = 24 cookies


*  Use this to find the value of 'x': 
  x = 24 cookies

*Step 1.* Given the information in the problem, it is worth noting that we need to determine the number of rides he can go on given the number of tickets Tom purchased, the number he spends on other booths and his remaining balance. 
*Step 2.*  Let's begin with finding out how many tickets he has left : Tom bought 40 tickets and spent 28 on a specific booth, meaning he has 40 - 28 = 12 tickets remaining.

*Step 3.*  To find out how many rides he can go on, we figure out the number of tickets required.  Each ride costs 4 tickets. 

*Step 4.* We know he has 12 tickets and each ride takes 4 tickets, so we calculate which of the tickets he has can buy 1 ride.   He can buy 12 / 4 = 3 rides.   

*Step 5.* So, Tom could go on **3** rides after purchasing them all for the tickets he had.

     *    Here, the problem is asking for a change in the number of students.
    
    
*    The word ""left"" tells us that 5 were kicked out of the class, or students left. 
*    However, this is just one of the actions,
*    The word ""came"" tells us that 11 new students came this year.


*    Now that we know the start, but are missing the end, here is what we need. 
*    We are missing the changes. The problem asks the question for the end of the year.
*    The end number of students must be considered after the changes.


*    The problem states that 5 students left, and 11 students came. So to find the end number
*    we need the starting number 31 + 5-11

**Step by step breakdown:**

1. **Identify the question** 
   - The question involves calculating the number of towels Maria has left after giving some to her mother. 

2. **Define the given information:**
   - Maria bought 35 green towels and 21 white towels.

3. **Define the unknown:**
   - We don't know how many towels Maria has left. 

4. **Define the relationship between the given and unknown information:**
   - Maria gave 34 of her towels to her mother. 
   
5. **Use the information to calculate the remaining towels:**

Let's break down this problem step by step:

**1.  Identify the key information:**

*   **Emily bought:** 4 chairs + 2 tables.
*   **Total cost:** 24 pieces. 
*   **Time spent:** 8 minutes. 
*   **Time per piece:**  This needs further clarification.

*   **Action:** Emily is placing furniture. 

**2.  Clarify the units:** 

*   **Chairs and Tables:** We need to determine if Emily is putting together *pieces* or a *whole furniture* to make our answers more accurate. 


**3.  Consider possible misunderstandings: 
*   **Confusion with Number:** Could the information be written in a more readable format such as "" Emily has 4 chairs."" and ""Emily has 2 tables"". 
*   **Missing Information:** Consider if there is extra information, like the price per chair, table, or amount of time spent per piece.

*  This is a simple problem that requires a little bit of number sense.

Let’s break the question down into smaller pieces:

*   **Step 1:  Determine the total number of shirts.**

   The problem asks us how many shirts Dave had. In total, he has 9 short sleeves + 27 long sleeves = 36 shirts. 

* **Step 2: Figure out how many shirts Dave washed.**

   We know Dave washed 20 of the shirts. 


* **Step 3: Calculate the number of shirts not washed.**

    We can do this by simply subtracting the number of shirts that were washed from the total number of shirts: 36 – 20 = 16


**Final answer** {The final answer is 16}.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the problem:**
    * The school cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples for their students' lunches.
    *  Only 5 students wanted fruit.
    * We need to find the number of apples left over after selling those 5 fruits.

2. **Identifying the unknowns:**
    *  The problem has two unknowns: the number of extra apples the cafeteria has and the number of students taking fruit 

3. **Simplifying the problem:**
    * What we need to find is how many extra apples are left over after serving five students.
    * To answer this, we must determine the total number of apples given to students first and then subtract the number they wanted.


4. **Problem Formulation:**

The cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 15 green ones. Only 5 students wanted fruit. 


 
5. **Using the information we found:**
    *  The cafeteria ordered  red :6 + 15 :15 = 21 apples.
    * The students wanted 5 students * 1 fruit = 5 fruit pieces
    *  To find the number of apples left over 
The cafeteria must subtract the number of fruit pieces from the fruits they ordered. 
6. **Finding the answer:** 
    *  The cafeteria had 21 apples, and 5 students took fruit.
   {The final answer is: 16 apples}

**Problem Breakdown:**

1. **Setting Up the Problem:** 
   - We know the number of managers (9) and employees (15) decided to play volleyball.
   - We're told to split them into 8 teams equally, meaning each team can have a different number of people.

2. **Identifying the Goal:**
   - The question is asking how many players would be on each team.

3. **Finding the Solution:**
   - To find the solution, we'll need to find the least common multiple. That would be the smallest number that can be broken down into all those numbers.

**Step by Step Solution:**

1. **Total Players:** 9 managers + 15 employees = 24 total players.
2. **Player Ratio:** We divide the total players by the number of teams: 24 players / 8 teams = 3 per team
3. **The Answer:** Therefore, each team would have 3 players {The final answer is 3} 

**Reasoning:**

* We divide the total number of players available by the number of teams to find the number of people per team, we are looking to split an equal number of players throughout the teams.
* This final number gives us the correct answer of players per team which is 3.

The question asks how many books are in the bin after the store does some actions to it. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Starting Amount:** 
   * The problem starts with 4 books in the bin.

2. **Selling Books:**
   * The starting amount of books is reduced by books sold. 
   * We aren't told how many were sold off initially, but we know there were 3 books left when sold. 

3. **Adding More Books:**
   * The store ""put 10 more"" books in the bin. 

4. **Final Count:**
   * We want to know how many are *in* the bin now, after these operations.

Now we have to combine these steps. Here's how:

* Start with 4 books. 
* Subtract the amount sold: 4 - 3 = 1
* Then add 10 more: 1 + 10 = 11

**Therefore the final answer is {11} books are in the bin.**

**My solution:**

1. **Identify key information:**
   - Faye scores 7 points for each treasure she finds.
   - She found 2 treasures on the first level.
   - She found 6 treasures on the second level.

2. **Calculate the score from the first level:** 
   -  Faye found 2 treasures * 7 points/treasure = 14 points

3. **Calculate the score from the second level:**
    - Faye found 6 treasures * 7 points/treasure = 42 points.

4. **Add the scores from both levels:**
   - 14 points + 42 points = 56 points

Let's break this problem down:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of files Wendy deleted.**

* Wendy deleted 37 out of 82 files.
* This can be written as: 37 / 82 * 100 = ?%

*Let's assume this percentage is for our calculation.


**Step 2: Calculate the number of files remaining.**

* Files remaining = Total files -  Files deleted
* Files remaining = 82 - 37 = 45

**Answer 2:** We need to calculate this!


**Step 3: Determine the number of folders.**

* Files remaining / Files per folder 
* 45 / 5 = 9


**Answer 3:** We need to calculate the number of folders

**Answer:** {The final answer is 12}

**Reasoning:** 


Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the information given in the problem.** 
    - Will made $104 for mowing lawns during the summer.
    - He spent $41 on new mower blades.

2. **Define the objective.**
    - We want to know how many $9 dollar games Will can buy with the remaining money after his blade purchase.

3. **Formulate an equation or equation system.**
   * Let 'g' represent the number of $9 dollar games Will can buy.
   * Since he spent $41 on blades and the $104 was for mowing,  the remaining money is $104-$41 = $63
   * We are essentially saying 'g' dollars of money is equivalent to '$63 / $9 per game' the cost per game. 


4. **Solve for the unknown.**
    *  g = $63 / $9 = 7

5. **Analyze the result.**
   * The result, 7,  means Will can buy 7 games with the money for lawn mowing after buying new blades.

*Step 1: Define variables.

Let's define variables to help us understand the quantities involved in the problem.
* `p` represents the initial number of puppies.
* `s` represents the number of puppies sold.
* `c` represents the number of cages.

We know:** 
 * `p = 13` 
 * `s = 7`
 * `c` = ?  


*Step 2: Write the equation based on the given information.*
We know the following about the number of puppies, cages, the numbers of puppies, and the cages used.
* Sold puppies (sold) 
 
 Let’s simplify the information given in the problem:
 
 ""In one day they sold 7 of them and put the rest into cages with 2 in each cage"" gives us

*p - s = ?**
 


*Step 3: Solve the equation to find the number of puppies left after the sale*
*  We have the equation: `p - s = ?` .
*  We need to find the number of puppies left (which is the answer to `?`) We can find out the answer by plugging in our value for `s`.
*   `p-7 = ?` 


*Step 4: Determine the number of puppies placed in cages*

   ```
   p - 7 = c * 2 
   ```
  
*  To solve for the unknown number of cages (c), isolate the term involving 'c'. 

* Step 5: Solve for ? 
  * We now have the equation: `p - 7 =  c * 2`
  * Notice: that `c * 2` represent the number of puppies in cages. 
  * The only thing we have left to determine is how many cages we're working with




*Step 6: Determine the number of cages used*

  * We know `p - 7 = c * 2`, 
  * We must find the value of `c`.  




*The final answer is  :*  


{The final answer is 6} 
``` 
**Explanation of each step:**
1. We defined variables to represent the unknown quantities to help us find the solutions to the problem.
2. We wrote an equation based on the given information. We used a clear and direct format to express the relationship between the numbers of puppies, cages and the number of cages used.
3. We used the given variable `p` and solved the equation `p-s = ?` to determine the number of puppies left (in cages) after the sale. 
4.  Using the information from the problem, we set up the equation and isolated `c` (number of cages)
5. We solved for `c` to find out the number of cages being used.

                You will need to:
                        
    1. List the  tickets Oliver used for each ride type, then calculate the total number of tickets he used in each category.
    2. Calculate  how many tickets he spent if the ferris wheel cost 7 tickets and the bumper cars cost 7 tickets.
    3. Calculate the total cost with the number of tickets used.

Let's break it down step-by-step!

```
Step 1: Determine the total ticket usage
```

* **Ferris wheel:** Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times.
* **Bumper cars:** Oliver rode the bumper cars 4 times. 

The ferris wheel took 5 x 7 tickets = 35 tickets 
The bumper cars took 4 x 7 tickets = 28 tickets

Therefore, he used 35 tickets for the ferris wheel and 28 tickets for the bumper cars 

```
Step 2: Calculate total cost of tickets
```

* **Ferris wheel cost:** 7 tickets per ride
* **Bumper cars cost:** 7 tickets per ride 

The total cost of tickets  is 35 tickets+28tickets= 63 tickets


```
Step 3: Calculate the total cost 
``` 

* There are 63 tickets used. 

**The final answer is: 63 tickets**.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces Dave started with.**
    *  Dave had 12 boxes of chocolate candy.
    *  Each box has 3 pieces of candy.

{The answer is}

Solution:
1. **Identify the key information:**

   * There were 39 customers initially.
   * The waiter added 12 more customers.
   * 49% of the customers didn't leave a tip, meaning 51% of the customers did tip. 

2.  **Calculate the total number of customers after the addition:**

    * Number of customers after additon: 39 + 12 = 51 customers. 

3. **Apply the percentage to calculate the number of customers who did tip:**

   * 51 customers * 51% = 26%.

*   3. Divide the total apples by the number of apples per pie to find the number of pies that could be made. {Explain this step} 
 

**You're ready**
*   1:  Apples handed out = 5 , so they have - 50 - 5 = 45 apples 
  
     

Let's put the steps together and see the final answer.



Answer: {The final answer is None. They cannot make pies with that amount of apples. The problem is flawed}

**Explanation:**

While the problem presents a logical scenario, it is ultimately flawed, resulting in an unsolvable answer. Here's a breakdown of why: 

1. **Apples Left**: The problem starts with 50 apples and hands out 5, leaving 45 apples. This is understandable.
2. **Apples for Pies**: The problem then states they use the rest for pies. 
3. **Maximum Pies:** The final calculation of how many pies they could make requires knowing the number of apples per pie. This isn't a problem in real-life, as the number of apples per pie needs to be specified before 50 is used to bake the pies. This calculation can be done with the remaining apples to determine the number of pies they could make.

**The Answer:** ""The final answer is None. They cannot make pies with that amount of apples.""

## Solution:

1. **Identify the given information:** Zoe found 8 boxes of winter clothing. 
2. **Identify what we need to find:** We need to find the total number of pieces of winter clothing Zoe has.
3. **Identify the formula/method:** We can calculate the number of scarves and mittens per box and then multiply that by the total number of boxes.

Please provide the solution. 



Solution:

Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

* **Cost per deck:** The problem starts by stating that each deck costs $7. 
* **Frank's purchase:** Frank purchased 3 decks at $7 each, so the cost for his decks is 3 * $7 = $21.
* **Friend's purchase:** Frank's friend purchased 2 decks at $7 each at a total cost of 2 * $7 = $14. 
* **Total cost:** To find the total amount they spent, add the costs from both purchases: $21 + $14 = $35. 

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is $35}
