**Solution:** 

1. **Total Students:** Begin by figuring out the total number of girls and boys: 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 total students.

2. **Total Cut:** We're told only 26 of these students got called back.  However, since it is not part of the information, we do not know if these 26 students had been called back.

3. **Students Called Back:**  There were 26 students selected.

4. **Students We Know Were Called Back:** We have information on both the total number of students called back and the initial students called back. Since these two numbers are part of the same set, there cannot be two responses to this question

5. **Students Not called Back:**  The difference between the number of students in a particular set (43 total) and the number of students in another set (26) equals the number of students we have not been told about and will not know about this outcome.

* **Step 4:** Calculate the points earned by defeating the last 3 enemies.
```
```
* **Step 5:** Add the points earned by winning all the enemies and the points earned by destroying the last 3.
```

```
Here's how we break down the problem to get to the answer:


**Step 1: Identify the knowns**

*  The game gives you 9 points per enemy defeated.
*  You defeated 11 enemies in total. 

**Step 2: Calculate the points earned by winning all the enemies**

* You defeated all but 3 enemies, meaning you defeated the total number of enemies: 11  enemies. 
*  Therefore, you earned 9  points per enemy  * 11  enemies = 99 points. 

**Step 3: Identify the unknown**

*   The unknown is the number of points earned by defeating the last 3 enemies.

**Step 4: Calculate the points earned by defeating the last 3 enemies**

* Every enemy defeated has 9 points.
* Since you lost 3 enemies remaining out of 11. 
* You defeated the 11 last enemies out of 11 (the total number).
* Therefore, you earned 9*3 = 27 points by winning all the enemies

 

 **Step 5: Add the points earned by winning all the enemies and the points earned by destroying the last 3.

* To start, 99 points were earned from defeating all the enemy. 
* The last 3 have a point value of 27 points.
* The answer to the question is 99 + 27 =  **126 total points earned**

**Solution:**
1. **Identify what information is given:** We know:
   - April's initial number of roses: 13
   - Roses left: 4
   - Price of each rose: $0.40

2. **Determine how many roses are sold:** April started with 13 roses and lost 4, creating a final rose count of 4. So: 13 - 4 = 9 roses
3. **Determine total earnings:** 
   - She sold the original 13 roses and got 9 roses left. We've worked out that a rose cost $0.4 for sale. April therefore sold all of the 9 roses. 
   - Therefore, each rose earned $0.4 for sale.
   - Total earnings: $0.40 * 9 = $3.60 

Therefore, {The final answer is $3.60}

 **Step 1: Determine what information is given.**
  * Tom had 5 books.
  * He sold 40/100 of them. We can symbolize this as 0.4 
  * He then bought 38 new books using the money he received from selling his books. 


 **Step 2: Formulate a question to address the problem.**
  * How many books would Tom have after buying new books?



 **Step 3: Utilize algebraic representation to solve the problem.**
 * Let 'x' be the number of books Tom had before selling some.  
 * We know that after selling some, he has a lesser amount so we can write down the equation: x - 0.4x =  number of books Tom has.

**Step 4: Solve for x  by simplifying the equation.**
 * 0.6x =  number of books Tom has.

     * 5 + 35 = 40 puppies 

* **Step 2:**  Number of puppies that could be adopted per day: *Puppies in the shelter* / *Puppies adopted per day* 
     * There are 40 puppies. We can adapt our answer to this. 40 / 8 = 5 puppies

* **Step 3:** Number of days to adopt all puppies: *Number of puppies* / *Puppies adopted per day* 
     * We have 40 puppies and can adopt 5 each day. 40 / 5 = 8 days.

{The final answer is}

Solution:
1. **Calculate the number of windows remaining:** 
   - The builder needs to install 9 windows.
   - They've already installed 6.
   - So, there are 9 - 6 = 3 windows remaining.

2. **Calculate the total installation time:**
   - Each window takes 6 hours to install.
   - The builder needs to install 3 windows.
   - Time = (Number of windows) * (Time per window)
   - Time = 3 * 6 = 18 hours. 

Therefore, it will take the builder 18 hours to install the rest of the windows. 
{The final answer is} 18 hours

##  Step 1: Determine the number of points from the first level

* Rachel found 5 treasures on the first level.
* Each treasure scores 9 points.
* The value of points for the first level = 5 * 9 = 45 points. {We are calculating the total points from the  first level}

## Step 2: Determine the number of points from the second level

* Rachel found 2 treasures on the second level.
* Each treasure scores 9 points.
* The value of points from the second level = 2 * 9 = 18 points. {We are calculating the total points from the  second level}


## Step 3: Sum the total points from both level

* Total points = points from first level + points from second level
* Total points = 45 + 18 = 63 points. {We are calculating the total points for the whole level}


**Therefore, Rachel's total score at the end is 63 points. {The final answer is 63}**

## Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Total Students:**  We first need to determine the total number of students in the debate team. 
   * This means we add together the number of boys and girls. 
   * Total students = 5 boys + 40 girls = 45 students 

2. **Groups and Limits:**  A group size of 9 implies that we can't have a group size of an additional 9 students. Our team of total students must be split into the total number of groups. 

3. **Possible Groups:** How many groups could be made that fit within their team size? 
   * We do this by dividing the total number of students by the group size.
   * Possible groups = Total students / Group size = 45 / 9 = 5  possible groups 

4. **Final Answer:**  Therefore, the debate team could split into 5 different groups.

Before we begin, it is important to clarify that the question is poorly worded. Let's break it down and fix the wording to make it clearer.

**Improved Question:**

Sam has 10 socks. He throws away 3 that are too old and doesn't fit. Then, he buys 36 new socks. How many socks would he have?

Now let's solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Start with the initial number of socks:** Sam starts with 10 socks.

2. **Subtract the socks thrown away:** He throws away 3 socks, so he has 10 - 3 = 7 socks left.

3. **Add the new socks:** He buys 36 new socks, so he has 7 + 36 = 43 socks in total.


**Final Answer:**  {Sam would have 43 socks.} 

**Explanation:** 

This problem follows a simple sequence of steps that allow for easy calculation and logical reasoning to solve the problem. We begin with the initial inventory, apply two changes (throwing the older socks out and buying new ones), and finally calculate the final number of socks.

 Here's my thought process:

1. **Know the starting amount:**  We begin with 96 apples in the cafeteria.
 
2. **Portion for lunch:** We are asked to take the apples to use.
   * The question asks how many pies they can make. So, we need to know how much is left for the pies.
   * To find the number of apples left, we need to subtract the apples given to students from the starting amount.
    
3. **Calculate the leftover apples:**
  * 96 - 42 = 54 apples remaining

4. **Calculate the number of pies:**
  * Divide the leftover apples by the number of apples needed per pie to find how many full pies they can make. 
  * 54 / 6 = 9 pies

Here is the breakdown of the solution:

1. **What is the total baked brownies?**
    * Since Tiffany baked 8 brownies and needs 17 total, we know she baked 17 - 8 = 9 pieces.
 
2. **How much flour did she use?**
    * She baked 9 brownies, and each brownie uses 8 cups of flour.
    * So, she used 9 * 8 = 72 cups of flour.

3. **How much flour does she still need?**
    * She needs 17 total brownies, but baked 9. This difference represents the missing amount of flour. 
    * She still needs 17 - 9 = 8 brownies. 
    * Lastly, we need to calculate the amount of flour needed to bake that amount – 72 cups of flour is what she has used.

4. **What is her total flour?**
    * To answer this, we need to calculate how much flour she still needs, which is 8 pieces of brownies * 8 cups/brownie = 64 cups.

* Step 1 = *Question:
* Step 2 = *Find how many pieces Bianca ate.
* Step 3 = * Find how many pieces she has left.
* Step 4 = *Find how many piles Bianca can make.

*Question:

Bianca received 78 pieces of candy for Halloween, and she ate some and then put the rest into piles with 8 pieces in each pile.  How many piles could she make?*

* **Step 1:** We know Bianca has 78 pieces of candy. And she ate a number of pieces.
  
* **Step 2:** 
  * Let's represent how many pieces Bianca ate as ""x""


* **Step 3:**
  * For Bianca to have remaining pieces left, we can figure that out by: 78 pieces - x pieces. 


* **Step 4:** * To find the number of piles she can make, we can use the leftover pieces : (78 - x)/8. This gives us the number of piles.

  



So how do I turn **Step 4** into an equation?


* **Step 4:** 
  * To find the number of piles Bianca can make, we can use the leftover pieces : (78 - x)/8. This gives us the number of piles.


We have a starting point because the question states the number of pieces Bianca begins with (78) and the number of pieces left after eating (78-x),  and we know the size of each pile = 8. 

Now we should turn the Step 4 into an equation that is equivalent to:

**Here's how to break it down:**

1. **Identify the unknowns:** 
   * We need to find out how many books Roger has *left* after selling some.  This is represented by the unknown ""how many books left"".
   
2. **Develop an equation:** 
   *  We know Roger started with 25 books. And he sold 21 of them, which are represented by the words *21 of them*.
        * equation: 25 - 21 =  how many books left
       
3. **Solve the equation:**
    * 25 - 21 = 4

4. **Understand the new purchases and the new amount:**
   * Roger is using the money he earned to buy 30 new books. 

5. **Develop another equation:** 
    * Starting with the amount of money he got after selling his 21 books to buy 30 new books, and also we know his money is spent to buy 30 of the new books.
     * equation: money earned - money spent on the new books = 30

6. **Solve the equation:**
    * To answer this, you have to find out how much money is left.

7. **Find the final number of books:**
    * Roger would have 30 new books + 4 existing books which are remaining = 34 books left


**Final Answer:** Roger would have 34 books.

*This is a real life problem. The key points of the question is about how to break it down and find the answer*

**Step 1:  Identifying the knowns and unknowns: ** 

* Knowns:
    *  Amount Frank made: $19.00
    *  Cost of the blades: $11.00

    *  Amount of money remaining: ? 
    *  Number of $2.00 games: ?


**Step 2: Setting up a simple equation:**  
*  Money remaining = Money he made - Money spent on blades 

**Step 3: Solving for the amount Frank has left:**

*  Money remaining  = $19.00 - $11.00 = $8.00

**Step 4:  Determining how many games he can buy:**

* Since $8.00 is less than $20.00, we could buy a  different number than 4. Then add 1 to get 5 or any integer between 1-10. He could buy a whole number of 2-dollar games.

Let's break down this problem to solve it step by step.

**Step 1: Find the total number of adventure and mystery books.**

* Victor bought 32 adventure books + 37 mystery books = 69 books.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of mystery and adventure books that were used.**

* 16 of the mystery books were used.
*  We need to determine the number he had in total that were mystery to be able to determine 16 were used. 

**  Step 3:  Determine the number of books he still has**

* Since Victor has 69 books,  and a number have been used up he still has 69 books - 16 books = 53 books left. 
 
**Step 4: Consider the question about the new books.**

* The problem asks how many new books Victor bought.

**Step 5:  Analyze the remaining books.**

*  We have 53 books left, and these books will be the new books, so the answer is $53 \text{ books}$


{The final answer is 53}

Since this isn't a standard math equation or scenario, we'll have to break down the problem to understand the actions taken:

**Step 1: Carrots after throwing out some**

* Maria started with 48 carrots.
* She threw out 11, so she has 48 - 11 = 37 left.

**Step 2: Pickups the next day**

* Maria picked 15 more carrots the next day. 
* So, she has 37 + 15 = 52 carrots now.

**Step 3: The total**

* Over two days, Maria had 37 + 15 = 52 carrots.

**The final answer is:** 52 carrots{The final answer is}

* **Step 1:**  Write out the problem clearly: Jerry made $14 mowing lawns and $31 weed eating, and only spent $5 per week.  How long would his money last? {Here's our original problem}**. 
 
**Step 2:** Total up the money Jerry made:  $14 (mowing) + $31 (weed eating) = $45. {We add together the money he earned}

**Step 3:** Determine how much money he has:  $45 (total) - $5 (spent) = $40.  {We subtract the amount spent from the amount earned to find out how long it would last him}. 

**Step 4:** To find out how many weeks the money would last us, we can divide his money by his spending: $40 / $5 = 8 weeks.     {Let's divide the total money by the cost per week}

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the number of books Adam sold:**

* Adam sold 11/33 of his books. 
* To express this as a fraction, simplify the fraction 11/33. We can simplify it since the numerator and denominator are both divisible by 11.
* 11/33 = 1/3 
* Adam sold **1/3** of his books. This remains as a fraction.

**2. Calculate the money Adam earned from selling books:**

* We know he sold 1/3 of his books, so he sold 1/3 * 33 books = 11 books. 
* We need to know how many books he sold, so we need a way to express this as a number. 


**3. Calculate how many new books Adam bought:**

* Adam used the money he earned to buy 23 new books. 


**4. Calculate how many books Adam would have in the end:**

                     ! Maria bought 2 new ! chairs and ? 2 new tables for ? her house. If she ? spent 8 minutes . on each piece furniture putting it together, how many minutes : did it , take her : to : finish?<end_of_turn>
*

Okay here's the breakdown: 
 

1. **Define variables:** 
    * Let 'C' represent the number of chairs
    * Let 'T' represent the number of tables
    *  Let 't' represent the total time 

2. **Set up equations:**

   * We know Maria bought 2 chairs:  C = 2
   * We know she bought 2 tables: T = 2 (Note, T = 2, to begin) 

3. **Determine Total Time:**
* Time spent on a chair = 8 minutes (One chair)
* Time spent on a tables = 8 minutes (One table)


*total time spent* = C * 8 + T* 8

**4. Calculate Total Time:**
* Total Time = (2 chairs * 8 minutes/chair) + (2 tables * 8 minutes/table)
* Total Time = 16 minutes + 16 minutes

*Total Time = 32 minutes

**The final answer is 32 minutes {The final answer is 32 minutes} . 



**Explanation of Logic:**
We needed to create a solution where a) Maria bought furniture, b) each piece was assembled in a given time, and c) the total number of pieces she assembled. The question clearly states how long Maria took to finish assembling each piece of furniture
  
**Important Notes:**
* This solution assumes that each piece of furniture (chair & table) takes a consistent time to assemble.

**1. Identify keywords**

* **Zoo:**  We are using the word ""at"" in relation to museums and zoo so this is a clue.
* **Museum:** Similar to ""Zoo"" we are using the word ""at"" for museum. 
* **Deleted:** The subject is deleted which means it's likely a number to which is then subtracted.
* **Had:** ""Had"" is a verb and its use will tell us what remained after the deletion.

**2. Understand the problem** 

The question asks for the number of pictures Rachel has left AFTER deleting some.

**3. Formulate an equation**

* Let x = the number of pictures from the zoo
* Let y = the number of pictures from the museum
* We know x = 6 (pictures at the zoo)
* We know y = 9 (pictures at the museum)
* We know Rachel deleted 11 pictures. 
* We want to know how many pictures she has left.


   **4. Solve for the final answer**

   *  Rachel started with 6 pictures at the zoo (x) + 9 pictures at the museum (y) = 15 pictures total
   *  The total she had before deletion was 15 pictures.
   *  We are left with 15-11 = {The remaining amount after deleting}


**5. The Final Answer**

* Step 1: Find the total number of green and white towels.
1. 37 towels are green and white. 
* Step 2: Calculate the number of towels Maria gave to her mother.
1.  Maria gave away 34 of her total towels.
* Step 3: Calculate the number of towels Maria ended up with.
1.  Maria had 37 towels and gave away 34 of them.
 { The final answer is: 3 towels}

* Why is this the final answer?

Let me know if you can't tell me the reasoning? 

Because of my previous post I need to go back to basics: this is a simple arithmetic problem.  Maria started with 37 towels —  the total number of green and white towels. Then, she gave away 34 of them to her mother. This results in a question of a simplified subtraction to determine the number of towels Maria ends up with.  We can use this to solve the problem for what we need, the number of towels Maria has remaining, and that amount of towels would be simply the total number of towels she had to begin with until she was giving them away.

   ## Solution and Explanation:
 
1. **Define the unknowns:**
   * Let 'x' represent the number of bags Paul filled on Sunday. 
   * The number of cans Paul picked up is the sum of cans in two days. 
   
2. **Set up the equation:** 
   *  Bags on Saturday: x = 6
   *  Bags on Sunday: x + 3
   *  Total cans in bags on Saturday: 6 * 8 = 48
   * Total cans in bags on Sunday: (x + 3) * 8
   
3**. Combine total cans from each day**: 
   * 48 + (x + 3) * 8

4. **Solve for x: **
    * x + 3 * 8 = 48
    * x + 24 = 48
    * x = 48 - 24
    * x = 24
 
5. **Calculate total cans picked up:**
    * (x + 3) * 8 = (24 + 3) * 8 = 27 * 8 = 216
 
6. **The final answer is:** 216
  
**Therefore, Paul picked up a total of 216 cans.**

Let's break it down:

1. **Identify key information:**
   - Roger is helping put books away.
   - There are 14 books to put away. 
   - The librarian takes 2/14 of the books (This is confusing, we need to figure out what this means)
   - Roger has the rest.
   - Roger can fit 3 books on a shelf.

2. **Clarify the librarian's action:**
   -  The librarian is taking 2/14 * 14 = 2 books.
   - So there is 12 books left for Roger. The librarian has taken 2.

3. **Calculate remaining books:**
   - Roger has 12 books left after the librarian took 2.

4. **Determine number of stacks/shelves:**
   - Roger can put 3 books per shelf

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the important information:**
   - The school ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples.
   - Only 5 students wanted fruit
   
2. **Calculate the total number of apples ordered:**
   - Total apples ordered = 6 + 15 = 21 

3. **Adjust for the number of students wanting fruit:** 
   - Since only 5 students wanted fruit, we need to calculate the extra apples. 
   - Extra apples = Total apples ordered - Total apples ordered by students wanting fruit

4. **Calculate the number of extra apples:**
    - Extra apples = 21 - 5 = 16

**The final answer is 16 {extra apples}**

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Total number of people:**  
   * The company has managers (who are a number unknown) along with employees (who are a number unknown)
2. **Splitting into teams:** 
   *  They split into 8 teams.
3. **Finding the number of people per team:**
   *  We need to divide the total number of people by the number of teams to figure out the people in each team.

**Using information in the original question, we can solve the problem by: 
1. figuring out the total number of people:
   * We have this information:
      * Managers number of people unknown. 
      * Employees: 15
      * Total people = Managers + Employees

2. Calculate how many people will be on a team in proportion to the information. 
   * Total people / number of teams = people per team.


The final answer is { 15 + managers people / 8 teams = people per team.} 


 
 

**Therefore, here is the final answer with explanations:**

Here's the breakdown:

The question is asking for a calculation based on the initial number of puppies, the number sold, and the number left over in their cage. 

* **Step 1. Identify the Given Information**

   We know that the pet store had 13 puppies.

   We know that they sold 7 puppies in one day.

*Please include all necessary information and calculations*


**Step 1:**  Identify the key information from the problem.

* We know Zoe had 8 boxes of winter clothing. 
* Each box contained 4 scarves + 6 mittens.
* We need to calculate the total number of scarves + mittens.


**Step 2:**  Use the information from Step 1 and the relationship between scarves and mittens to calculate the total number of scarves and mittens.

* 6 mittens * 4 scarves per jacket = 24 scarves
* 6 mittens * 4 scarves per jacket = 24 scarves


**Step 3:** 

*  The problem states that there were 8 boxes of winter clothes. 
* We now know there are 24 scarves of winter clothes plus 24 mittens. 

**Step 4:**  Calculate the total number of winter clothing pieces.
    * We have a new number of scarves from Step 2 and a new number of mittens from Step 3 .

   **The total pieces of winter clothing is: 24 scarves + 24 mittens  = 48 pieces**.

*  *G = 2 * 7*  ($7 * 2 decks)

* **Step 4:  Solve the equation.**

Since we have the variables for how much Frank and his friend spent, we can use the equation to calculate total cost for decks in dollars

* *F = ?* 
* *G = ?*
