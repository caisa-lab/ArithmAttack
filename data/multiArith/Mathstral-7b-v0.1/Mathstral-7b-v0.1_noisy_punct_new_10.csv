                    question:
                     Paige ! had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how ; many songs ? does she have on her mp3 player? 
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. Paige starts with 11 songs on her mp3 player.
2. She deletes 9 songs from it, so the number of songs she has now is:
   Songs remaining after deletion = Initial number of songs - Number of songs deleted
   = 11 - 9
   = 2 songs
3. Then she adds 8 new songs to her mp3 player, so the number of songs she has now is:
   Songs remaining after addition = Songs remaining after deletion + Number of songs added
   = 2 + 8
   = 10 songs

Therefore, {Paige has 10 songs on her mp3 player}.</s>",10

                     There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the ! schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called back, how many ? students didn't make the ! cut? 
                [/INST] The problem states that there were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the ! (we don't know the number of schools, but it's less confusing to use ""1"" or ""the"" instead of a placeholder like ""!"" for now) basketball team, making a total of 39 + 4 = 43 students.

If only 26 of them got called back, then the number of students who didn't make the cut is the total number of students minus the number of students who got called back: 43 - 26 = 17 students.

Therefore, {The final answer is} 17 students didn't make the cut.</s>",17

                [/INST] Sure, let's break it down:

1. Faye starts with 34 coloring books.
2. She then gives away 3 coloring books, so we subtract those from her total: 34 - 3 = 31 coloring books.
3. After giving some away, she buys 48 more. So we add those to her current total: 31 + 48 = 79 coloring books.

So, the final answer is that Faye would have 79 coloring books in total. {The final answer is: 79}</s>",79

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that each enemy defeated gives 9 points.
2. The level has a total of 11 enemies.
3. You destroy all but 3 of them, so you defeat 11 - 3 = 8 enemies.
4. To find out how many points you earn, multiply the number of enemies defeated by the points each enemy gives. So, 8 enemies * 9 points/enemy = 72 points.

Therefore, the final answer is {72 points}.</s>",72

                [/INST] Megan didn't recycle 5 bags out of the 14 she had. So, the number of bags she actually recycled is:

14 - 5 = 9 bags

She earns 8 points for each bag she recycles, so the number of points she would have earned is:

9 * 8 = 72 points

So, the final answer is {Megan would have earned 72 points}.</s>",72

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many roses April sold during the sale. She started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left, so she sold:

Roses sold = Initial roses - Remaining roses
= 13 - 4
= 9 roses

Each rose was sold for 4 dollars, so the total money she earned from the sale is:

Total money earned = Roses sold * Price per rose
= 9 * 4
= 36 dollars

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to find out the total number of shirts Ned had to wash. He had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts. So, the total number of shirts is 9 (short sleeve) + 21 (long sleeve) = 30 shirts.

2. Ned managed to wash 29 shirts by the time school started. So, the number of shirts he did not wash is the total number of shirts minus the number of shirts he washed.

3. Therefore, the number of shirts Ned did not wash is 30 (total shirts) - 29 (washed shirts) = 1 shirt.

                [/INST] Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's find out how many people actually attended the luncheon. The company invited 47 people, but 7 didn't show up. So, the number of people who attended is 47 - 7 = 40 people.

2. Next, we need to find out how many tables are needed if each table holds 5 people. To do this, we divide the total number of attendees by the number of people per table: 40 people ÷ 5 people/table.

3. So, they need 40/5 = 8 tables.

                [/INST] The problem can be broken down into the following steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many pieces of candy they had in total before they ate any. This can be done by adding Debby's pieces of candy to her sister's pieces of candy. That is, 32 (Debby's candy) + 42 (her sister's candy) = 74 pieces of candy in total.

2. Next, we need to subtract the number of pieces of candy they ate from the total number of pieces of candy they had. That is, 74 (total pieces of candy) - 35 (pieces of candy eaten) = 39 pieces of candy left.

So, {The final answer is $\boxed{39}$} pieces of candy left.</s>",39

                [/INST] Let's solve this step by step:

1. Emily had 41 seeds in total. She planted 29 of them in the big garden.
2. This leaves her with 41 - 29 = 12 seeds to plant in her small gardens.
3. Each small garden requires 4 seeds.
4. So, the number of small gardens Emily had is the total remaining seeds divided by the seeds per small garden.

Therefore, Emily had 12 / 4 = 3 small gardens.

                [/INST] First, let's find out how many books Mike is left with after the librarian takes some of them. The total number of books was 82, and the librarian took 10 books, so:

1. Total books = 82
2. Books taken by the librarian = 10
3. Books left with Mike = Total books - Books taken by the librarian
   Books left with Mike = 82 - 10
   Books left with Mike = 72

Now, we need to find out how many shelves Mike will need to put away the remaining books. He can fit 9 books on a shelf, so:

4. Books per shelf = 9
5. Number of shelves = Books left with Mike / Books per shelf
   Number of shelves = 72 / 9
   Number of shelves = 8

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. First, find the total number of pictures Nancy took during her vacation by adding the number of pictures she took at the zoo and the museum.

Number of pictures at the zoo = 49
Number of pictures at the museum = 8

Total number of pictures = Number of pictures at the zoo + Number of pictures at the museum
= 49 + 8
= 57 pictures

2. Next, find the number of pictures Nancy still has after deleting 38 pictures.

Number of pictures deleted = 38

Number of pictures remaining = Total number of pictures - Number of pictures deleted
= 57 - 38
= 19 pictures

So, Nancy still has 19 pictures from her vacation.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. We know that the waiter had 7 customers.
2. Out of these 7 customers, only 2 left a tip. This is because 5 of them didn't leave a tip.
3. Each of the customers who did leave a tip gave $3.

To find out how much money the waiter earned, we multiply the amount each tipping customer gave by the number of customers who tipped:

$3/customer * 2 customers = $6

So, the waiter earned $6 in tips.

{The final answer is 6 dollars}

This is a simple multiplication problem, but it can also be thought of as calculating the total amount of money the waiter earned from the customers who did leave a tip.</s>",6

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we start by understanding that John earned $8 for each lawn he mowed. He was supposed to mow 15 lawns, but he forgot 7 of them. So, the number of lawns he actually mowed is calculated by subtracting the lawns he forgot from the total he was supposed to mow:

\[15 - 7 = 8\]

This means John actually mowed 8 lawns. To find out how much money he earned, we multiply the number of lawns he mowed by the amount he earns per lawn:

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step.

1. Initially, the shelter had 5 puppies. Then 35 more were brought in. So, the total number of puppies is 5 + 35 = 40 puppies.

2. If 8 puppies are adopted each day, we can calculate the number of days it would take for all of them to be adopted.

3. To do this, we divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day. So, 40 / 8 = 5 days.

So, {The final answer is} 5 days.</s>",5

2. So, the total number of mystery books is 4 books/shelf \* 5 shelves = 20 books.

For the picture books:
1. Each shelf has 4 books and there are 3 shelves.
2. So, the total number of picture books is 4 books/shelf \* 3 shelves = 12 books.

Finally, to find the total number of books Gwen has, we add the two totals together:

Total books = Mystery books + Picture books
= 20 books + 12 books

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to find out how many groups of 9 can be made from the total number of students in the debate team.

Step 1: Add the number of boys and girls to find the total number of students.
Total students = Number of boys + Number of girls

Since we can't have half a student, we'll round this down to 40 students (assuming we're only considering whole students).

Step 2: Divide the total number of students by the group size to find out how many groups can be made.
Number of groups = Total students / Group size
= 40 / 9

1. Victor is a sacker at a grocery store. This means he's an employee of the store, possibly loading groceries into customers' cars or assisting customers inside the store.

2. Victor is paid $6 an hour.

3. On Monday, he worked for 5 hours. So, the amount he earned on Monday can be calculated by multiplying his hourly wage by the number of hours he worked. That is, 6 dollars/hour * 5 hours = $30.

4. On Tuesday, he also worked for 5 hours. So, the amount he earned on Tuesday can also be calculated by multiplying his hourly wage by the number of hours he worked. That is, 6 dollars/hour * 5 hours = $30.

5. To find out how much money Victor made in those two days, we simply add the amount he earned on Monday and the amount he earned on Tuesday. That is, $30 (Monday's earnings) + $30 (Tuesday's earnings) = $60.

1. First, we need to find out the total number of people going on the trip. This includes both the students and the adults. So, the total number of people is 12 students + 3 adults = 15 people.

2. Next, we need to determine how many vans are needed to accommodate all these people. Each van can hold 5 people. So, the number of vans needed would be the total number of people divided by the number of people each van can hold.

3. Therefore, the number of vans needed is 15 people / 5 people per van = 3 vans.

So, {The final answer is 3 vans}.</s>",3

                [/INST] To determine how many shelves Tom would fill up, we need to calculate the total number of sodas he has and then divide that number by the capacity of each shelf. 

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sodas. 
Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas, so the total number of sodas is:
4 (regular sodas) + 52 (diet sodas) = 56 (total sodas)

Step 2: Determine how many shelves are filled up.
If each shelf holds 7 sodas, we divide the total number of sodas by the capacity of each shelf:
56 sodas / 7 sodas per shelf = 8 shelves

The final answer is: Tom will fill up 8 shelves.</s>",8

                [/INST] Here's how you can solve this problem in a step-by-step manner:

1. The cafeteria started with 38 apples.
2. They used 20 apples for lunch, so they used those apples and were left with 38 - 20 = 18 apples.
3. Then, they bought 28 more apples. So, they now have 18 (they had left after feeding the students) + 28 (newly bought apples) = 46 apples.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate how many trips Luke needs to make to pick up the trays from the first table.

Number of trays from the first table = 20
Number of trays Luke can carry at a time = 4

Number of trips to pick up trays from the first table = Number of trays from the first table / Number of trays Luke can carry at a time
= 20 / 4
= 5 trips

Next, let's do the same for the trays from the second table.

Number of trays from the second table = 16
Number of trays Luke can carry at a time = 4

Number of trips to pick up trays from the second table = Number of trays from the second table / Number of trays Luke can carry at a time
= 16 / 4
= 4 trips

Finally, to find out how many trips Luke needs to make in total, we add the number of trips for each table.

Total number of trips = Trips for the first table + Trips for the second table
= 5 trips + 4 trips
= 9 trips

So, Luke needs to make 9 trips to pick up all the trays. {The final answer is} 9.</s>",9

                [/INST] Step 1: Identify the number of action figures Henry already has and the total number he needs for a complete collection.
Henry has 3 action figures and needs 8 in total.

Step 2: Determine the number of action figures Henry still needs to buy.
Henry still needs 8 - 3 = 5 action figures (since he already has 3).

Step 3: Calculate the cost of each action figure.
Each action figure costs $6.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Henry needs to buy the remaining action figures.
Henry needs to buy 5 action figures, each costing $6, so he needs 5 * $6 = $30.

                [/INST] To find out how many 8 dollar toys Frank can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has after receiving his allowance.

Step 1: Add the money Frank saved up to the money from his allowance.
Total money = Money saved up + Allowance
Total money = 3(dollars) + 37(dollars)

Step 2: Now, we'll divide the total money by the cost of one toy to find out how many toys Frank can buy.
Number of toys = Total money / Cost of one toy
Number of toys = Total money / 8(dollars)

Substitute the value of total money from step 1 into this equation:
Number of toys = (3(dollars) + 37(dollars)) / 8(dollars)

Perform the addition and then the division:
Number of toys = 40(dollars) / 8(dollars)
Number of toys = 5

Final answer: Frank can buy \boxed{5} 8 dollar toys.</s>",5

1. Vanessa and her mom picked a total of 17 + 14 = 31 carrots.
2. If only 24 of these carrots were good, then the number of bad carrots is the total number of carrots minus the number of good carrots.

                [/INST] Tiffany has 8 brownies already made, but she needs a total of 17 brownies for her party. This means she needs to bake 9 more brownies (17 - 8 = 9).

Each brownie requires 8 cups of flour. So, for 9 more brownies, she would need 72 cups of flour (9 * 8 = 72).

Now, we need to consider how much flour she has already used. She used 8 cups of flour for the 8 brownies she already made. So, the total amount of flour she had before she needs to bake the additional brownies is 64 cups (8 * 8 = 64).

Therefore, Tiffany still needs 40 more cups of flour (72 - 64 = 40).

                [/INST] First, let's find the total number of carrots picked by Carol and her mom.

Carol picked = 29
Her mom picked = 16

Total carrots picked = Carol picked + Her mom picked
Total carrots picked = 29 + 16
Total carrots picked = 45

Next, we know that only 38 carrots were good. So, to find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked.

Bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Good carrots
Bad carrots = 45 - 38
Bad carrots = 7

The final answer is that there were \boxed{7} bad carrots.</s>",7

                [/INST] The problem states that there are 7 problems on each worksheet. A teacher has 17 worksheets to grade and has already graded 8 of them. To find out how many more problems the teacher has to grade, we need to calculate the total number of problems on the remaining worksheets.

Step 1: Calculate the number of remaining worksheets.
The teacher has 17 worksheets in total and has already graded 8 of them. So, the number of remaining worksheets is:
17 (total worksheets) - 8 (already graded) = 9 (remaining worksheets)

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the number of games Luke had left after selling some of them.

Luke started with 39 games and sold 19. So, the number of games he has left is:

39 - 19 = 20 games

Next, let's find out how many boxes he needs to pack these 20 games into, with each box holding 4 games.

The number of boxes needed is:

20 games / 4 games per box = 5 boxes

So, the final answer is:

                [/INST] First, we need to find out how many students were picked for the team. We know that there are 65 students trying out and 17 of them didn't get picked.

So, the number of students picked = Total number of students - Number of students not picked
                                   = 65 - 17
                                   = 48

Next, we need to divide this number by the number of groups to find out how many students would be in each group.

Number of students in each group = Number of students picked / Number of groups
                                  = 48 / 8
                                  = 6

                [/INST] The question seems to be missing some information. It says ""Isabel uploaded 25 pictures to Facebook. She put 10 pics into one album"" but then it asks ""How many pictures were in each album?"" without specifying how many pictures were put into the remaining 5 albums. Could you please provide this information?

Assuming the total number of pictures in the remaining 5 albums is X (which we don't know), the steps would be as follows:

1. We start with a total of 25 pictures.
2. We know that 10 pictures are in one album, so we subtract these from the total: 25 - 10 = 15 pictures.
3. These 15 pictures are to be divided equally among the remaining 5 albums. So, we divide the number of pictures by the number of albums: 15 / 5 = 3 pictures per album.

{The final answer is 3 pictures per album, but only if we make the assumption that the remaining 15 pictures were divided equally among the 5 albums.}</s>",3

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much money Mike made in total. He made $14 from mowing lawns and $26 from weed eating. So, his total income is:
   Total income = Income from mowing lawns + Income from weed eating
   = $14 + $26
   = $40

2. Next, we need to find out how long this money would last if he spends $5 a week. To do this, we'll divide his total income by his weekly spending:
   Duration = Total income / Weekly spending
   = $40 / $5
   = 8 weeks

So, the money would last Mike 8 weeks.

                [/INST] First, we need to find the total number of files Vanessa had on her flash drive before deleting any. She had 16 music files and 48 video files. 

Total files = Music files + Video files
                  = 16 + 48
                  = 64 files

Next, we need to subtract the number of files Vanessa deleted from the total number of files.

Files remaining = Total files - Deleted files
                          = 64 - 30
                          = 34 files

1. The shelter initially had 2 puppies.
2. Then, another 34 puppies were brought in, making the total number of puppies in the shelter 2 + 34 = 36 puppies.
3. If 4 puppies are adopted each day, we can calculate the time it would take for all puppies to be adopted by dividing the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted each day.

1. Find out how many pieces of clothing Will didn't put in the first load.
2. Divide these remaining pieces of clothing into 9 equal loads.

Step 1:
To find out how many pieces of clothing Will didn't put in the first load, we subtract the number of pieces in the first load from the total number of pieces.

59 (total pieces) - 32 (pieces in the first load) = 27 (pieces not in the first load)

Step 2:
To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we divide the number of remaining pieces by the number of loads.

27 (pieces not in the first load) / 9 (loads) = 3 (pieces per load)

Next, let's calculate the number of reading problems:
Number of reading pages = 4
Number of problems per page = 5
Total reading problems = Number of reading pages * Number of problems per page = 4 * 5 = 20

Finally, to find the total number of problems Isabel had to complete, we add the total number of math problems and the total number of reading problems:

1. We know that Bianca has 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books.

2. Each shelf (mystery or picture books) holds exactly 8 books.

3. So, the total number of mystery books is 5 shelves * 8 books per shelf = 40 books.

4. Similarly, the total number of picture books is 4 shelves * 8 books per shelf = 32 books.

5. To find the total number of books, we add the number of mystery books to the number of picture books.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out the total number of cards John has. He has 8 new cards and 16 old cards.

Total cards = New cards + Old cards
Total cards = 8 + 16
Total cards = 24

2. Next, we need to find out how many pages he would use to organize these cards, given that he puts 3 cards on each page.

Number of pages = Total cards / Cards per page
Number of pages = 24 / 3
Number of pages = 8

So, John would use 8 pages to organize his baseball cards.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach:

1. First, we need to determine how many more brownies Isabel needs to bake to have a total of 5 for her party. Since she has already baked 3 brownies, the number of additional brownies she needs to bake is $5 - 3 = 2$.

2. Next, we calculate the amount of flour required for these additional brownies. Since each brownie requires 5 cups of flour, the total amount of flour needed for the 2 additional brownies is $2 \times 5 = 10$ cups of flour.

3. Therefore, Isabel still needs $\boxed{10}$ cups of flour to bake the remaining 2 brownies for her party.</s>",10

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. On Saturday, Paul filled 6 bags with cans. Each bag had 8 cans, so the total number of cans he collected on Saturday is:
   Cans on Saturday = Bags on Saturday * Cans per bag
   = 6 bags * 8 cans/bag
   = 48 cans

2. On Sunday, he filled 3 more bags, each with 8 cans. So, the total number of cans he collected on Sunday is:
   Cans on Sunday = Bags on Sunday * Cans per bag
   = 3 bags * 8 cans/bag
   = 24 cans

3. To find the total number of cans Paul collected over the two days, we add the number of cans he collected on Saturday to the number of cans he collected on Sunday:

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. Bianca recycled 24 pounds of paper. For every 3 pounds, 1 point is earned. So, Bianca's recycling can be divided into groups of 3 pounds.

Number of groups for Bianca = Total pounds recycled by Bianca / Pounds per group
= 24 / 3
= 8 groups

So, Bianca earned 8 points.

2. Bianca's friends recycled 3 pounds of paper. This is exactly 1 group of 3 pounds.

Number of groups for Bianca's friends = Total pounds recycled by Bianca's friends / Pounds per group
= 3 / 3
= 1 group

So, Bianca's friends earned 1 point.

3. To find out the total points earned, we add the points earned by Bianca and her friends.

Total points = Points by Bianca + Points by Bianca's friends

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of members on the debate team by adding the number of boys and girls. This gives us:

- Total members = Number of boys + Number of girls
- Total members = 26 boys + 46 girls
- Total members = 72 members

Next, we need to determine how many groups of 9 can be made from the total number of members. This is done by dividing the total number of members by the group size:

- Groups = Total members ÷ Group size
- Groups = 72 members ÷ 9 members/group
- Groups = 8 groups

Therefore, the debate team can be split into $\boxed{8}$ groups of 9 members each.</s>",8

                [/INST] Certainly! Let's break this down step by step:

1. The cafeteria ordered a total of 6 red apples and 15 green apples. This means that the total number of apples ordered is:
   Total apples = 6 red + 15 green
   Total apples = 21 apples

2. Only 5 students wanted fruit. Since the cafeteria ordered 21 apples and only 5 students wanted them, we can calculate the number of extra apples by subtracting the number of students who wanted fruit from the total number of apples:
   Extra apples = Total apples - Apples wanted
   Extra apples = 21 - 5
   Extra apples = 16 apples

So, the cafeteria ended up with 16 extra apples.</s>",16

Next, we need to divide this total number by the number of teams to find out how many people would be on each team:

Number of people per team = Total number of people / Number of teams
= 24 / 8
= 3

So, there would be 3 people on each team.

                [/INST] First, we calculate the total number of bags Sam filled by adding the number of bags he filled on Saturday and Sunday.
Total Bags = Bags on Saturday + Bags on Sunday
= 3 + 4
= 7 Bags

Next, we calculate the total number of cans Sam collected by multiplying the total number of bags by the number of cans per bag.
Total Cans = Total Bags * Cans per Bag
= 7 Bags * 9 Cans/Bag
= 63 Cans

So, Sam collected 63 cans.

                [/INST] The teacher had 16 worksheets to grade in total. However, she had already graded 8 of them. This means there are still some worksheets left to grade. To find out how many, we can subtract the number of worksheets already graded from the total number of worksheets:

16 (total worksheets) - 8 (already graded worksheets) = 8 (worksheets left to grade)

Each worksheet has 4 problems on it. So, to find out how many more problems the teacher has to grade, we can multiply the number of worksheets left to grade by the number of problems per worksheet:

1. Each box contains 5 scarves and 5 mittens, which adds up to 10 pieces of clothing per box (5 scarves + 5 mittens = 10 pieces of clothing).

2. Paige has 6 boxes filled with this amount, so to find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we multiply the number of pieces per box by the number of boxes: 10 pieces per box * 6 boxes = 60 pieces of winter clothing.

57 games - 39 games = 18 games

Luke packed the remaining 18 games into boxes, with 2 games in each box. To find out how many boxes he used, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:

                [/INST] The first step is to understand the price of each flower. From the problem, it's mentioned that each flower was 3 dollars. Since Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies, and assuming each flower is the same price, we can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of all flowers Emily bought.

So, the calculation is as follows:

Cost of 2 roses = 2 * $3 = $6
Cost of 2 daisies = 2 * $3 = $6

Next, we add the cost of the roses and the daisies to find the total cost:

Total cost = $6 (roses) + $6 (daisies) = $12

Therefore, Emily spent {The final answer is $12}.</s>",12

1. The pet store started with 13 puppies.
2. They sold 7 of them, so we subtract those from the total to find out how many are left: 13 - 7 = 6 puppies.
3. Each cage can hold 2 puppies. To find out how many cages they used, we divide the remaining number of puppies by the number of puppies each cage can hold: 6 / 2 = 3 cages.

2. They found out that only 12 of the carrots were good. So, the remaining carrots are bad.

3. To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots they picked: 28 (total carrots) - 12 (good carrots) = 16 bad carrots.

So, the final answer is that they had 16 bad carrots.

                [/INST] To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing Zoe had, we need to first find the number of pieces in one box and then multiply that by the total number of boxes.

1. One box contains 4 scarves and 6 mittens. So, the total number of pieces in one box is:
   Pieces in one box = Scarves +mittens
   = 4 + 6
   = 10

2. Zoe has 8 boxes of clothing. So, the total number of pieces of winter clothing Zoe has is:
   Total pieces = Pieces in one box * Number of boxes
   = 10 * 8
   = 80

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is 80 pieces of winter clothing}.</s>",80

                [/INST] Frank bought 3 decks at $7 each, so he spent 3 * $7 = $21.
His friend bought 2 decks at $7 each, so his friend spent 2 * $7 = $14.
Together, they spent $21 + $14 = $35.

                [/INST] Sam had a total of 40 short sleeve shirts + 23 long sleeve shirts = 63 shirts to wash.

He washed 29 shirts before school started.

So, the number of shirts he did not wash is 63 total shirts - 29 washed shirts = 34 shirts.

                    question:
                     A waiter . had 47 customers to wait on. If 41 customers left and . he got another 20 customers, how many customers would he have? 
                [/INST] The reasoning behind this problem is:

Step 1: Calculate the number of customers remaining after the waiter attended the first group of customers. The waiter initially had 47 customers. After 41 customers left, the number of remaining customers is:

47 (initial customers) - 41 (leaving customers) = 6 (remaining customers)

Step 2: Add the number of customers who joined the waiter after the first group of customers left. The waiter got another 20 customers. So, the total number of customers the waiter would have is:

6 (remaining customers) + 20 (new customers) = 26 (total customers)

Therefore, the waiter would have 26 customers.

{The final answer is: 26}</s>",26
