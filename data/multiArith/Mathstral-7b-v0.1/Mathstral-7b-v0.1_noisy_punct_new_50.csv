                    question:
                    .  Paige , had 11 . songs on her . mp3 player. If ! she deleted 9 old songs ! from : it , and then . added : 8 new . songs, how , many : songs , does she ! have ? on her mp3 player? : 
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. Paige starts with 11 songs on her mp3 player.
2. She deletes 9 old songs, so she has 11 - 9 = 2 songs left.
3. Then she adds 8 new songs, so she now has 2 + 8 = 10 songs on her mp3 player.

So, the final answer is, Paige has {10} songs on her mp3 player.</s>",10

                    question:
                    ?  , There were 39 girls and , 4 . boys trying out for ; the : schools , basketball ! team. If ! only 26 ! of ? them got ! called back, how many students didn't ; make ? the cut? ? 
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of students who tried out for the basketball team. This is done by adding the number of girls and boys together:

- Number of girls = 39
- Number of boys = 4

Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys
= 39 + 4
= 43

Next, we find out how many students got called back. According to the question, 26 of them got called back. To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students:

Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students - Number of students who got called back
= 43 - 26
= 17

Therefore, the number of students who didn't make the cut is 17.

{The final answer is \boxed{17}}</s>",17

                [/INST] First, we need to understand that Faye initially had 34 coloring books. Then she gave away 3 of them, so the number of coloring books she had left is:

Faye's initial coloring books - Given away = 34 - 3 = 31

Next, she bought 48 more coloring books, so the total number of coloring books she would have is:

Faye's remaining coloring books + Bought = 31 + 48 = 79

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{79}.</s>",79

                [/INST] Let's reason through this problem:

1. The cafeteria initially had 23 apples.

2. They used 20 apples to make lunch for the students.

3. Subtract the number of apples used from the total number of apples: 23 - 20 = 3 apples remaining.

4. They then bought 6 more apples.

5. Add the number of new apples to the number of remaining apples: 3 + 6 = 9 apples.

Therefore, the cafeteria would have 9 apples after making lunch and buying additional apples.

{The final answer is 9.}</s>",9

                [/INST] Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. The goal is to find out how many points you would earn by defeating a specific number of enemies in a game.
2. The game rewards 9 points for each enemy defeated.
3. The total number of enemies in the level is 11.
4. You defeat all but 3 of these enemies, so the number of enemies defeated is 11 (total) - 3 (undefeated) = 8.
5. To find out how many points you would earn, you multiply the number of enemies defeated by the points rewarded for each defeat.

So, the calculation would be:

8 (enemies defeated) * 9 (points per defeat) = 72 points

But from the problem statement, it seems there is a typo in the question. It's mentioned that each defeated enemy gives 'you' points, which kind of contradicts itself. If it's 'you' who defeated him, it should be 'you' earning the points. I've assumed it to mean 'each enemy defeated' gives 9 points as in the usual context.

{The final answer is} 72 points.</s>",72

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bags that Megan recycled. She had 14 bags but didn't recycle 5 of them. So, the number of bags she recycled is 14 - 5 = 9 bags.

2. Next, we need to find out how many points she earned for recycling these bags. Megan earns 8 points for each bag of cans she recycles. So, the total points she earned is 8 points x 9 bags = 72 points.

{The final answer is 72 points.}</s>",72

                [/INST] First, let's determine how many roses April sold. She started with 13 roses and had 4 left, so she sold 13 - 4 = 9 roses.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses she sold. Each rose was 4 dollars, so the total cost is 9 roses * 4 dollars/rose = 36 dollars.

Therefore, the final answer is {April earned 36 dollars}.</s>",36

                [/INST] The problem seems to state that Ned had 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts to wash before school. He washed 29 of them by the time school started. To find out how many he didn't wash, we need to subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts he had.

Step 1: Add the total number of short sleeve and long sleeve shirts to get the total number of shirts Ned had to wash.
Total shirts = short sleeve shirts + long sleeve shirts
Total shirts = 9 + 21
Total shirts = 30

Step 2: Subtract the number of shirts Ned washed from the total number of shirts he had to wash.
Unwashed shirts = total shirts - washed shirts
Unwashed shirts = 30 - 29
Unwashed shirts = 1

So, the final answer is:
{The final answer is: he didn't wash 1 shirt.}</s>",1

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. The company invited 47 people to a luncheon.
2. But, 7 of them didn't show up. So, the number of people who did show up is 47 - 7 = 40 people.
3. Each table can hold 5 people. So, the number of tables needed would be the total number of people divided by the number of people each table can hold, which is 40 / 5.

Therefore, the company needs 8 tables for their luncheon. {The final answer is 8 tables.}</s>",8

                    question:
                     ! For , a ; birthday party . Jerry ? bought 41 regular sodas . and 22 diet sodas. . If : his fridge . would ; only , hold , 9 on ? each : shelf, how , many shelves would he fill ; up? 
                [/INST] The problem can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Divide the total number of regular sodas by the maximum number of sodas each shelf can hold. This will give us the number of shelves needed for the regular sodas.

41 regular sodas / 9 sodas per shelf ≈ 4.56 shelves

Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, we need 5 shelves for the regular sodas.

2. Divide the total number of diet sodas by the maximum number of sodas each shelf can hold. This will give us the number of shelves needed for the diet sodas.

22 diet sodas / 9 sodas per shelf ≈ 2.44 shelves

Again, rounding up to the nearest whole number, we need 3 shelves for the diet sodas.

3. Add the number of shelves needed for the regular sodas and the diet sodas to find out the total number of shelves needed.

5 shelves for regular sodas + 3 shelves for diet sodas = 8 shelves

Therefore, Jerry would need 8 shelves to fill up his fridge.

1. Debby and her sister combined their candy. Debby had 32 pieces, and her sister had 42 pieces. So, they had a total of 32 + 42 = 74 pieces.

2. They ate 35 pieces on the first night. So, the number of pieces they have left is 74 - 35 = 39.

Therefore, the final answer is that they have 39 pieces of candy left. {The final answer is 39 pieces.}</s>",39

                [/INST] To determine the number of small gardens Emily has, we first need to calculate the remaining seeds after she planted 29 of them in her big garden.

1. Subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds.
 41 (total seeds) - 29 (seeds planted in big garden) = 12 (remaining seeds)

2. Next, we know that each small garden has 4 seeds. We can find the number of small gardens by dividing the remaining seeds by the number of seeds per small garden.

3. Divide the remaining seeds by the number of seeds per small garden.
 12 (remaining seeds) / 4 (seeds per small garden) = 3 (number of small gardens)

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to determine the total amount of candy Emily has. She received 5 pieces from her neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister. So, let's add these together: 5 + 13 = 18 pieces of candy.

2. Next, we need to figure out how long this candy will last if Emily eats 9 pieces a day. To do this, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of pieces she eats per day: 18 ÷ 9 = 2 days.

So, the candy would last Emily 2 days. {The final answer is: 2 days.}</s>",2

1. **Total number of pictures taken**: Nancy took 49 pictures at the zoo and 8 pictures at the museum. So, the total number of pictures she initially had is 49 + 8 = 57 pictures.

2. **Number of pictures deleted**: Nancy later deleted 38 pictures.

3. **Number of pictures remaining**: To find out how many pictures she still has, we subtract the number of pictures deleted from the total number of pictures taken. So, 57 - 38 = 19 pictures.

So, the final answer is that Nancy still has 19 pictures from her vacation.</s>",19

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. The builder has already installed 8 windows.
2. There are 14 windows in total that need to be installed.

So, to find out how many windows are left to install (the rest), we subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed:

14 windows (total needed) - 8 windows (already installed) = 6 windows (left to install)

Now, if it takes 8 hours to install each window, we can calculate the total time needed to install the remaining windows by multiplying the number of remaining windows by the time it takes to install each window:

6 windows (left to install) x 8 hours/window = 48 hours

So, it will take the builder 48 hours to install the rest of the windows.

The final answer is {48 hours}.</s>",48

                [/INST] First, we need to find out how much John earned for mowing one lawn: it's given as ""$8"" per lawn.

Next, we need to determine how many lawns he actually mowed. He was supposed to mow 15 lawns, but he forgot 7 of them, so he only mowed 15 - 7 = 8 lawns.

Now, we can calculate how much money he earned by multiplying the number of lawns he mowed by the amount he earns per lawn: 8 lawns * $8/lawn = $64.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. We start with 5 puppies.
2. Then, 35 more puppies are brought in, making the total number of puppies 5 + 35 = 40 puppies.
3. If 8 puppies are adopted each day, to find out how many days it would take for all of them to be adopted, we divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted each day. So, 40 puppies divided by 8 puppies per day equals 5 days.

Therefore, it would take 5 days for all of the puppies to be adopted. {The final answer is five days.}</s>",5

1. The builder has already installed 6 windows, so he has 3 windows left to install (since 9 - 6 = 3).
2. It takes 6 hours to install each window, so to install 3 windows, it would take him 3 times the time to install one window.
3. Therefore, the total time needed to install the rest of the windows is 3 * 6 = 18 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the number of worksheets remaining ungraded after the teacher initially graded 7 worksheets.
This is done by subtracting the number of worksheets that were initially graded (7) from the initial total (34).
34 - 7 = 27 worksheets

Step 2: Add the number of worksheets that were turned in later (36) to the number of worksheets that were left ungraded (27).
27 + 36 = 63 worksheets

So, the final answer is that the teacher would have to grade {a total of 63 worksheets}.</s>",63

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of tickets Frank won and then determine how many candies he can buy with those tickets.

1. First, let's add the number of tickets Frank won from 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball'. Frank won 33 tickets from 'whack a mole' and 9 tickets from 'skee ball'. So, the total number of tickets Frank won is 33 + 9 = 42 tickets.

2. Next, we need to find out how many candies Frank can buy with 42 tickets. If one candy costs 6 tickets, then the number of candies Frank can buy is the total number of tickets divided by the cost of one candy in tickets.

So, the number of candies Frank can buy is 42 / 6 = 7 candies.

Therefore, \boxed{Frank can buy 7 candies.}</s>",7

First, let's find out how many adults are in the group. We can do this by subtracting the number of kids from the total number of people:

13 (total people) - 9 (kids) = 4 (adults)

Next, we calculate the cost for the adult meals. We know that each adult meal costs $7, so:

4 (adults) * $7 (cost per adult meal) = $28

Since the kids eat for free, the total cost for the group to eat would be just the cost of the adult meals:

Total cost = $28

Therefore, the final answer is:

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Paige had 43 math problems and 12 science problems. So, the total number of problems she had initially is the sum of the math problems and science problems.
   Total problems = Math problems + Science problems
   = 43 + 12
   = 55 problems

2. She finished 44% of the problems at school. To find out how many problems she finished, we need to calculate 44% of the total number of problems.
   Problems finished = Total problems * Percentage finished
   = 55 * 0.44
   = 24.2

Since she can't finish a fraction of a problem, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. So, she finished 24 problems and had 31 problems left.

Therefore, {The final answer is 31 problems} that Paige had to do for homework.</s>",11

1. Rachel is playing a video game where she scores points for each treasure she finds.
2. She found 5 treasures on the first level. This means she scored 5 * 9 = 45 points on the first level.
3. She found 2 treasures on the second level. This means she scored 2 * 9 = 18 points on the second level.

1. The waiter initially had 26 customers to wait on.

2. Then, during the lunch rush, he added another 27 customers.

3. So, the total number of customers the waiter had to wait on is 26 (initial customers) + 27 (added customers) = 53 customers.

4. If 27 of the customers didn't leave a tip, then the number of customers who left a tip is the total number of customers minus those who didn't tip.

5. So, the number of customers who left a tip is 53 (total customers) - 27 (didn't tip) = 26 customers.

The store then put these bears onto shelves with 9 bears on each shelf. To find out how many shelves they used, we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf.

Number of shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears per shelf
= 27 / 9

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many pictures Wendy put in the one album that she put 44 pictures into. That's 44 pictures.

2. Next, we need to find out how many pictures she put into the rest of the albums. She uploaded a total of 79 pictures, and she put 44 into the one album. So, she put 79 - 44 = 35 pictures into the rest of the albums.

3. Now, we need to find out how many pictures were in each of the rest of the albums. Wendy put 35 pictures into the rest of the albums, which is 5 albums. So, she put 35 / 5 = 7 pictures into each of the rest of the albums.

4. Finally, we need to find out how many pictures were in each album in total. Wendy put 44 pictures into the one album and 7 pictures into each of the other 5 albums. So, she put 44 + (5 * 7) = 44 + 35 = 79 pictures in total. But since all 79 pictures were already distributed among the 6 albums, each album must have the same number of pictures. Therefore, 79 / 6 = 13 remainder 1 pictures were in each album. But since each album cannot have a fraction of a picture, there must be an error in the initial question.

The final answer, based on the information given, is that there must be an error in the initial question. {The final answer is: There must be an error in the initial question.}

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of students in the debate team.

Total students = Number of boys + Number of girls
= 0.5 * 5 + 40
= 2.5 + 40 = 42.5

However, the number of students cannot be a decimal. This could mean that there might be a mix-up in the number of boys. Suppose the number of boys is 5 (not 0.5), then we can proceed with the calculation.

Now, let's calculate how many groups of 9 students can be formed.

Number of groups = Total students / Group size
= 42 / 9 = 4 remainder 6

This means that 4 groups of 9 students can be formed, with 6 students remaining. This is because 9 * 4 = 36 and 36 + 6 = 42.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of players.
Initially, there were 2 friends playing the online video game.

Step 2: Determine the total after additional players join.
After 2 more players joined, the total number of players became:
Initial players + Additional players
= 2 + 2
= 4 players

Step 3: Calculate the total number of lives.
Since each player has 6 lives, and there are 4 players (as calculated in Step 2), the total number of lives is:
Total lives = Number of players * Lives per player
= 4 * 6
= 24 lives

Therefore, the total number of lives they have is {24}.</s>",24

First, let's calculate the total number of people:
12 students + 3 adults = 15 people

Next, we need to figure out how many vans are needed to accommodate 15 people. Since each van can hold 5 people, we can divide the total number of people by the number of people each van can hold:
15 people / 5 people per van = 3 vans

So, they will need 3 vans to transport everyone to the zoo.

1. The cafeteria starts with 38 apples.
2. They use 20 apples to make lunch for the students.
3. They then buy 28 more apples.

To find out how many apples they would have, we need to subtract the apples used from the initial amount and then add the newly bought apples.

Apples after using them = Initial apples - Apples used

                [/INST] The problem states that Frank had saved up 3 dollars and received another 3.7 dollars for his allowance. The question is asking how many 8-dollar toys he could buy.

Step 1: Calculate Frank's total amount of money.
Frank had saved up 3 dollars and received another 3.7 dollars. So, his total amount of money is the sum of these two amounts.
Total money = Savings + Allowance
Total money = 3 + 3.7
Total money = 6.7 dollars

Step 2: Determine how many 8-dollar toys Frank could buy.
To do this, we'll divide his total amount of money by the cost of each toy.
Number of toys = Total money / Cost per toy
Number of toys = 6.7 / 8

Step 3: Calculate the result.
Number of toys = 6.7 / 8 = 0.8375

Since we cannot buy a fraction of a toy, Frank could buy only 0 toys (or he couldn't buy any toy).

Frank made $19 over the summer. He spent $11 on new mower blades. So, his savings after buying the blades is $19 - $11 = $8.

Step 2: Determine how many $2 games Frank can buy with the money he had left.
Since each game costs $2, we divide the amount of money Frank has left by the cost of one game. So, Frank can buy $8 / $2 = 4 games.

Step 1: Add the number of new and returning players together.
48 new players + 6 returning players = 54 players total

Step 2: Divide the total number of players by the number of players per group.

1. Determine the number of students who were picked for the team. Since 17 students weren't picked, we subtract this number from the total number of students trying out:
   65 (total students) - 17 (students not picked) = 48 (students picked)

2. Now, we need to divide the number of students picked by the number of groups to determine how many students would be in each group. Since there are 8 groups, we divide the number of students picked by the number of groups:
   48 (students picked) / 8 (groups) = 6 (students per group)

To find out how many pictures were in each of the 5 albums, we first need to subtract the 10 pictures that were put into the first album from the total number of pictures.

25 (total pictures) - 10 (pictures in one album) = 15 pictures remaining to be distributed.

These 15 pictures were then distributed equally into 5 albums. So, to find out how many pictures were in each of these albums, we divide the remaining pictures by the number of albums:

15 (remaining pictures) / 5 (number of albums) = 3 pictures per album.

{The final answer is} 3 pictures in each of the 5 albums.</s>",3

1. Mike made $14 from mowing lawns.
2. Mike made $26 from weed eating.
3. So, the total amount of money Mike made is $14 (from mowing lawns) + $26 (from weed eating) = $40.
4. If Mike spends $5 each week, we need to calculate how many weeks this money will last.
5. To do this, we divide the total amount of money Mike made ($40) by how much he spends each week ($5). So, $40 divided by $5 equals 8 weeks.

Therefore, the money would last Mike 8 weeks. {The final answer is 8 weeks}.</s>",8

1. Initially, Vanessa had 16 music files and 48 video files on her flash drive. So, the total number of files on her flash drive at this point was 16 + 48 = 64 files.
2. If she deleted 30 files, then the number of files remaining on her flash drive would be the initial total (64 files) minus the files she deleted (30 files).

So, the calculation is:
64 files (initial total) - 30 files (deleted) = 34 files remaining

Therefore, there are 34 files still on her flash drive.

The question seems to be asking how many shirts Dave didn't wash before school started, given that he washed 20 of them.

1. First, let's find out the total number of shirts Dave had. He had 9 short-sleeve shirts and 27 long-sleeve shirts. So, the total number of shirts is 9 + 27 = 36 shirts.

2. If he washed 20 of them before school started, then the number of shirts he didn't wash is the total number of shirts minus the number of shirts he washed. So, 36 - 20 = 16 shirts.

9 (total potatoes) - 7 (cooked potatoes) = 2 (remaining potatoes)

Each potato takes 3 minutes to cook. Since the chef needs to cook 2 more potatoes, the total time required will be:

2 (remaining potatoes) * 3 (minutes per potato) = 6 minutes

So, it will take the chef 6 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

1. Price of roses: 5 roses * $6/rose = $30
2. Price of daisies: 5 daisies * (price per daisy unknown, but should be given in the question) = 5 * unknown_price

Add the two amounts to get the total price. The question states that ""?"" is used in the place of unknown price.

Total cost = Price of roses + Price of daisies
                  = $30 + 5 * unknown_price

Since the price of daisies is unknown, we can't calculate the exact total cost. But, if we had the price of daisies, we would multiply it by 5 and then add $30 to find the total amount Katie spent.

First, let's find out the total number of pages of homework Isabel has:

1. Isabel has 2 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading homework.
2. To find the total number of pages, we add the pages of math homework to the pages of reading homework:

Total pages = Pages of math homework + Pages of reading homework
= 2 + 4
= 6 pages

Next, we need to find out the total number of problems she has to complete. Each page of homework has 5 problems on it, so:

1. To find the total number of problems, we multiply the total number of pages by the number of problems per page:

Total problems = Total pages * Problems per page
= 6 * 5
= 30 problems

Therefore, Isabel has to complete a total of 30 problems.</s>",30

                [/INST] Janet bought 6 country albums and 2 pop albums, and each album had 9 songs.

To find the total number of songs Janet bought, we need to find the sum of the number of songs in the country albums and the pop albums.

First, let's find the number of songs in the country albums.

The number of songs in the country albums is equal to the number of country albums multiplied by the number of songs per album.

Songs in country albums = Number of country albums * Songs per album
= 6 * 9
= 54 songs

Next, let's find the number of songs in the pop albums.

The number of songs in the pop albums is equal to the number of pop albums multiplied by the number of songs per album.

Songs in pop albums = Number of pop albums * Songs per album
= 2 * 9
= 18 songs

Now, let's add the number of songs in the country albums and the pop albums to find the total number of songs Janet bought.

Total number of songs = Songs in country albums + Songs in pop albums
= 54 + 18
= 72 songs

= $45

Next, we need to calculate how long the money would last if Jerry spends $5 a week.

Number of weeks the money would last = Total money / Money spent per week
= $45 / $5
= 9 weeks

So, the money would last Jerry 9 weeks.

First, let's compute the number of mystery books. Nancy had 2 shelves of mystery books, and each shelf holds 6 books. So, the total number of mystery books is:
2 shelves * 6 books/shelf = 12 books

Next, let's compute the number of picture books. Nancy had 6 shelves of picture books, and each shelf holds 6 books. So, the total number of picture books is:
6 shelves * 6 books/shelf = 36 books

Now, we simply add the number of mystery books and picture books to find the total number of books Nancy had:
12 books (mystery) + 36 books (picture) = 48 books

1. Paul initially had 3 dollars.
2. He then received another 7 dollars for his allowance.
3. To find out how many 5-dollar toys he can buy, we need to add his initial amount to his allowance and then divide the total amount by the price of each toy.

Let's calculate:

Initial amount = 3 dollars
Allowance = 7 dollars

Total amount = Initial amount + Allowance
Total amount = 3 + 7 = 10 dollars

Number of 5-dollar toys = Total amount / Price per toy
Number of 5-dollar toys = 10 / 5 = 2 toys

So, Paul can buy 2 five-dollar toys.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. We start with the total number of bird cages, which is 4.

2. Each bird cage contains 8 parrots. So, the total number of parrots in the store would be 4 (cages) * 8 (parrots per cage) = 32 parrots.

3. Each bird cage also contains 2 parakeets. So, the total number of parakeets in the store would be 4 (cages) * 2 (parakeets per cage) = 8 parakeets.

4. To find the total number of birds in the store, we need to add the total number of parrots and parakeets together. So, 32 (parrots) + 8 (parakeets) = 40 birds.

Therefore, {The final answer is} the pet store has a total of 40 birds.</s>",40

1. First, we need to find out how many pieces of chocolate candy Kaleb bought in total. He bought 14 boxes, and each box contains 6 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is 14 (boxes) * 6 (pieces per box) = 84 pieces.

2. Then, Kaleb gave 5 boxes to his little brother. But since we want to find out how many pieces he still has, we don't need to subtract the number of boxes given away.

3. So, Kaleb still has all the pieces he bought initially, which is 84 pieces.

Therefore, the final answer is {Kaleb still has 84 pieces of chocolate candy}.</s>",54

1. First, we need to find the total number of pictures Robin uploaded to Facebook. She uploaded 31 pictures from her phone and 5 from her camera, so the total number of pictures is:

Total pictures = Pictures from phone + Pictures from camera
   Total pictures = 31 + 5
   Total pictures = 36

2. Next, we know that these 36 pictures were sorted into 9 different albums, with the same amount of pictures in each album. To find out how many pictures were in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
   Pictures per album = 36 / 9
   Pictures per album = 4

So, each of the 9 albums had 4 pictures.

1. First, we need to find out how much money Mike has left after buying the new mower blades.
   
   The money he had left is the total money he made minus the money he spent on mower blades.

   So, the money he had left = Total money - Money spent on blades
   = $69 - $24
   = $45

2. Now, we need to find out how many $5 games he can buy with the money he has left.

   The number of games he can buy = Money he has left / Price of one game

   = 9 games

Therefore, the final answer is that Mike can buy 9 five-dollar games with the money he has left.</s>",9

                [/INST] The question asks how many baggies Maria can make with 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies, given that each baggie contains either 8 chocolate chip cookies or 8 oatmeal cookies.

First, let's find the total number of cookies Maria has:

Total cookies = Chocolate chip cookies + Oatmeal cookies
= 5 + 19
= 24 cookies

Now, since each baggie can contain only one type of cookie, let's check if Maria can make complete baggies with either of the two types of cookies:

With chocolate chip cookies:
Number of chocolate baggies = Total chocolate chip cookies / Cookies per baggie
= 5 / 8
= 0 with 5 cookies left over

With oatmeal cookies:
Number of oatmeal baggies = Total oatmeal cookies / Cookies per baggie
= 19 / 8
= 2 with 3 cookies left over

So, Maria can make only 2 complete oatmeal baggies. Therefore, the number of baggies she can make is 2.

Each flower costs $3.

Step 2: Identify the types and quantity of flowers Zoe bought.
Zoe bought 8 roses and 2 daisies. Since the question doesn't specify a difference in price between roses and daisies, we can assume they cost the same.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
The total cost is the cost per flower multiplied by the total number of flowers.
Total number of flowers = 8 roses + 2 daisies = 10 flowers
Total cost = $3/flower * 10 flowers = $30

So, the final answer is:

                [/INST] Bianca is organizing her bookcase by ensuring that each shelf has exactly 8 books on it. She has 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books. To find the total number of books, we need to multiply the number of shelves for each type of book by the number of books per shelf.

First, let's calculate the number of mystery books:
Number of mystery books = Number of mystery shelves * Number of books per shelf
= 5 shelves * 8 books/shelf
= 40 books

Next, let's calculate the number of picture books:
Number of picture books = Number of picture shelves * Number of books per shelf
= 4 shelves * 8 books/shelf
= 32 books

Now, we can find the total number of books by adding the number of mystery books and picture books:
Total number of books = Number of mystery books + Number of picture books
= 40 books + 32 books
= 72 books

So, Bianca has {72} books in total.</s>",72

Next, we need to determine how many pages he would use to store these cards. Each page can hold 3 cards. Since 24 cards need to be stored, we divide the total number of cards by the number of cards per page. So, 24 cards divided by 3 cards per page equals 8 pages.

Therefore, John would use 8 pages to store his cards.

                [/INST] Problem:
John had 33 socks. He threw away 19 old ones and bought 13 new ones, so how many socks would he have?

Solution:

1. We start with the initial number of socks John had, which is 33.

{He had 33 socks}

2. Then, he threw away 19 old ones.

{He threw away 19 socks}

3. To find out how many socks he has now, we subtract the number of socks he threw away from the initial number of socks.

So, 33 - 19 = 14

{He has 14 socks left after throwing away 19}

4. Next, he bought 13 new ones.

{He bought 13 socks}

5. Now, to find out how many socks he has after buying 13 new ones, we add the number of new socks to the number of socks he had after throwing away the old ones.

So, 14 + 13 = 27

{He has 27 socks after buying 13 new ones}

                [/INST] The problem is about Emily buying furniture for her house. She bought 4 chairs and 2 tables. Each piece of furniture took her 8 minutes to put together. We need to find out how many minutes it took her to finish putting all the furniture together.

Step 1: Understand that Emily bought 4 chairs and 2 tables, and it took her 8 minutes to put each piece together.

Step 2: Calculate the total time it took her to put the chairs together. Since she bought 4 chairs and it took her 8 minutes per chair, the total time spent on chairs is 4 chairs * 8 minutes/chair = 32 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate the total time it took her to put the tables together. Since she bought 2 tables and it took her 8 minutes per table, the total time spent on tables is 2 tables * 8 minutes/table = 16 minutes.

Step 4: Calculate the total time it took her to put all the furniture together. This is the sum of the time spent on chairs and tables, which is 32 minutes (chairs) + 16 minutes (tables) = 48 minutes.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. First, we'll find the total number of parrots in all the cages. Since there are 6 cages and each cage has 2 parrots, the total number of parrots is:
   Total parrots = Number of cages * Parrots per cage
   = 6 * 2
   = 12 parrots

2. Next, we'll find the total number of parakeets in all the cages. Each cage has 7 parakeets, so the total number of parakeets is:
   Total parakeets = Number of cages * Parakeets per cage
   = 6 * 7
   = 42 parakeets

3. Finally, to find the total number of birds in the pet store, we add the total number of parrots and parakeets:
   Total birds = Total parrots + Total parakeets
   = 12 + 42
   = 54 birds

So, the pet store has a total of 54 birds.

1. First, we need to identify the total number of shirts Dave had to wash. This includes both short-sleeved and long-sleeved shirts. According to the problem, Dave had to wash 9 short-sleeved shirts and 27 long-sleeved shirts. So, the total number of shirts is:

Total shirts = Short-sleeved shirts + Long-sleeved shirts
   = 9 + 27
   = 36 shirts

2. Next, we need to determine how many shirts Dave washed before school started. According to the problem, Dave washed 20 of them.

3. Now, to find out how many shirts Dave did not wash, we subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts:

Unwashed shirts = Total shirts - Washed shirts

                [/INST] It seems like your problem statement is missing some key words and symbols. However, based on the given structure of the problem, I'll provide a general approach to solve this type of problem:

1. Identify the number of red and green apples ordered: 6 red apples and 15 green apples.

2. Identify the number of students who wanted fruit: 5 students.

3. Calculate the total number of apples each student would get if they equally divided the apples: (6 red apples + 15 green apples) / 5 students = 21 apples / 5 students = 4.2 apples per student. However, since students can't get fractions of apples, we would assume they'd get 4 apples each and there'd be some leftovers.

4. Calculate the number of apples left after distributing to the 5 students: Total apples - (Number of students * Apples per student) = 21 - (5 * 4) = 21 - 20 = 1 apple.

So, the cafeteria ended up with 1 extra apple.

                [/INST] Let's break this down:

1. Paige has 43 math problems and 12 science problems for homework. So, in total, she has 43 + 12 = 55 problems.

2. She finished 44% of her problems at school. To find out how many problems this is, we calculate 44% of 55.
   This is done by multiplying 44 by 55/100 (which is the decimal equivalent of 44%).

3. So, 44 * (55/100) = 24.2 problems. However, since we can't have a fraction of a problem, we round this to the nearest whole number. So, she finished 24 problems at school.

4. Since she finished 24 problems at school, she has 55 - 24 = 31 problems left to do for homework.

Therefore, the final answer is that Paige has to do \boxed{31} problems for homework.</s>",11

1. First, we need to find out the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded. She uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 pictures from her camera. So, the total number of pictures is:
   Total pictures = 5 (from phone) + 35 (from camera) = 40 pictures

2. Next, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums she created to find out how many pictures were in each album. She created 8 different albums, so the number of pictures in each album is:
   Pictures in each album = Total pictures / Number of albums = 40 / 8 = 5 pictures

23 chocolate chip cookies + 25 oatmeal cookies = 48 cookies

Next, we need to determine how many baggies she can make with 6 cookies in each baggie. To do this, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per baggie:

48 cookies ÷ 6 cookies per baggie = 8 baggies

However, since Robin cannot make a baggie with part of a cookie, she can only make 8 full baggies with 6 cookies in each. The remaining cookies cannot be distributed evenly among the baggies.

Total pieces of candy = Katie's candy + Sister's candy = 8 + 23 = 31

Pieces of candy eaten = 8

Step 4: Subtract the number of pieces eaten from the total number of pieces.

Pieces of candy left = Total pieces of candy - Pieces of candy eaten = 31 - 8 = 23

3. So, in total, he has 9 + 7 = 16 trays to pick up.
4. If he can only carry 8 trays at a time, he would need to make at least 2 trips to carry all 16 trays. But since he can't carry the last 2 trays on a single trip with 6 of the first batch, he needs to make a third trip.

So, Jerry will make 3 trips to pick up 16 trays.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. The chef still needs to cook 12 potatoes.

2. He has already cooked 6 potatoes. So, the number of potatoes left to cook is 12 - 6 = 6 potatoes.

3. Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

4. Therefore, to cook the remaining 6 potatoes, it will take 6 potatoes * 6 minutes/potato = 36 minutes.

Hence, {The final answer is 36 minutes}.</s>",36

57 games - 39 games = 18 games

Luke then packed the remaining games into boxes, putting 2 games into each box. To find out how many boxes he has to use, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:

18 games ÷ 2 games/box = 9 boxes

Therefore, Luke had to use 9 boxes to pack the remaining games. {The final answer is: \boxed{9}.}</s>",9

1. Each flower costs $3.
2. Emily bought 2 roses, which means 2 flowers.
3. She also bought 2 daisies, which is another 2 flowers.

So in total, she bought 4 flowers (2 roses + 2 daisies).

If each flower costs $3, then the total cost would be:

Cost = Price per flower * Number of flowers
= $3 * 4

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. First, we need to determine how many flowers Isabel had after 10 of them wilted. Since she had 66 flowers and 10 wilted, she now has 66 - 10 = 56 flowers.

2. Next, we need to find out how many bouquets Isabel can make with the remaining flowers. Since she is making bouquets with 8 flowers each, we divide the number of flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet. So, 56 / 8 = 7 bouquets.

The final answer is that Isabel can make 7 bouquets for her friend’s wedding.</s>",7

1. Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times.
2. He rode the bumper cars 4 times.
3. Each ride costs 7 tickets.

To find out the total number of tickets Oliver used, we need to add the number of tickets used for each ride and then multiply by the number of times each ride was taken.

For the ferris wheel:
5 (times ridden) * 7 (tickets per ride) = 35 tickets

For the bumper cars:
4 (times ridden) * 7 (tickets per ride) = 28 tickets

Now, let's add the tickets used for both rides:
35 (ferris wheel tickets) + 28 (bumper car tickets) = 63 tickets

1. The waiter initially has 39 customers to wait on.
2. During the lunch rush, he adds another 12 customers, making a total of 39 + 12 = 51 customers.
3. We are told that 49% of the customers didn't leave a tip.

Now, to find out how many customers left a tip, we first need to find out what 49% of the total number of customers is.

49% of 51 customers = (49/100) * 51 = 24.99, but since we can't have a fraction of a customer, we'll round this to 25 customers who didn't leave a tip.
5. If 25 customers didn't leave a tip, then the number of customers who did leave a tip is the total number of customers minus the ones who didn't. So, 51 customers - 25 customers = 26 customers left a tip.

So, the final answer is {26 customers left a tip}.</s>",2

1. Oliver had $33 in January.
2. By March, he spent $4.

So, we subtract the $4 he spent from his initial amount of $33:

$33 - $4 = $29

Now, we know that after spending $4, Oliver has $29 left.

3. Oliver then received another $32 from his mom.

So, we add this $32 to his current amount:

1. Start with the initial number of apples: 14
2. Subtract the apples used for lunch: 14 - 13 = 1
3. Add the additional apples bought: 1 + 49 = 50

Here, it seems like the ""?"" and ""!"" symbols might be creating confusion. If we assume that they are intended to be placeholders for specific numbers, such as ""13"" representing the number of apples used for lunch and ""49"" representing the number of additional apples bought, then the computation would be correct. However, without clear context or additional information, this is a bit speculative.

Assuming the ""?"" and ""!"" are supposed to be placeholders, the final answer would be: {50}.

If they are not, and we should be treating the sentence as written (which would imply that 14 apples were used for lunch, and then 49 more apples were bought, which doesn't add up), then we might need to re-evaluate the problem statement.

                    :  : Sam had ! to wash 40 ? short sleeve shirts and 23 long , sleeve shirts before school. ! If ; he ! had only : washed 29 ; of them by the ; time . school : started, . how , many ? did ? he not ? wash? 
                [/INST] To solve the problem, we'll break it down into clear, step-by-step calculations:

1. **Total Number of Shirts**: Sam had to wash a total of 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts. To find the total, we add these two numbers together:
   \[
   40 \text{ short sleeve shirts} + 23 \text{ long sleeve shirts} = 63 \text{ shirts}
   \]

2. **Shirts Not Washed by School Start**: It's given that Sam washed 29 of these shirts by the time school started. To find out how many shirts he didn't wash, we subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts:
   \[
   63 \text{ shirts} - 29 \text{ shirts} = 34 \text{ shirts}
   \]

Therefore, the number of shirts Sam did not wash by the time school started is \(\boxed{34}\).</s>",34

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. Initially, the waiter had 47 customers.
2. 41 customers left, so he had 47 - 41 = 6 customers remaining.
3. Then, he got another 20 customers, so he now has 6 + 20 = 26 customers.

The final answer is that the waiter would have 26 customers.</s>",26
