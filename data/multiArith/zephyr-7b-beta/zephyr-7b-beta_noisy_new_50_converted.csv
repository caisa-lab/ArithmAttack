<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach:

1. Paige originally had 11 songs on her MP3 player.
2. She deleted 9 old songs, reducing the number of songs on her MP3 player.
3. After deleting the 9 old songs, Paige had the following number of songs on her MP3 player: 11 - 9 = 2 songs.
4. Later, she added 8 new songs to her MP3 player.
5. The total number of songs on her MP3 player, after adding the 8 new songs, is equal to the number of songs she had after deleting the 9 old songs, plus the 8 new songs.
6. Using step 3 and the information from step 5, we can set up an equation to find the number of songs Paige has now: 2 + 8 = x
7. Solve for x: 10 = x
8. Therefore, after deleting 9 old songs and adding 8 new songs, Paige has a total of 10 songs on her MP3 player.

The final answer is: Paige has 10 songs on her MP3 player after deleting 9 old songs and then adding 8 new songs.</s>",10,10.0,8.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the given information using variables and equations. 

Let x be the number of girls and y be the number of boys.

We are given that the total number of students trying out for the team is 39 + 4 = 43. Let this be represented by n.

We also know that out of the total number of students, 26 got called back. Let this be represented by m.

Using these variables, we can create an equation for the number of students who did not get called back (call it z):

n - m = z (the number of students who didn't make the cut is the same as the number who didn't get called back)

Substituting the values given to us for n, m, and our original variables (x and y), we get:

43 - 26 = z

17 = z

So, the number of students who didn't make the cut is 17.

Now, to find the number of girls and boys who didn't make the cut (g and b, respectively), we first find the total number of girls who tried out. Let this be represented by g0.

g0 = x (we are not given any information regarding whether or not some of the girls did not try out, so we can assume that all 39 girls did try out)

Then, we find the number of girls who got called back (g):

g = 0.63 * g0 (assuming that the proportion of girls who were called back is the same as that of all students, which is 0.63)

Subtracting g from g0 gives us the number of girls who didn't get called back (g1):

g1 = g0 - g

Following the same process as for the total number of students who didn't get called back (using the number of boys who weren't called back, which is 4 - y1, where y1 is the number of boys who tried out), we have:

y1 = b - (4 - y1)

y1 (and subsequently, b) is found by solving the quadratic equation:

0 = y1^2 + [4 - (x0 - g1 - (0.63 * x0) + m)] y1 - (x0 - g1 - (0.63 * x0)) [(m + g1) + 1]

This equation is formed by substituting the values of x0, m, and g1 in the quadratic formula (where b is y1, and we have removed the constants from the quadratic formula to make it more manageable). 

While this solution is possible, it is quite lengthy and does involve advanced mathematical concepts. It is much simpler to make the assumption that the number of girls and boys who didn't make the cut is the same, in which case we can represent the number of students (both girls and boys) who didn't make the cut as z. This would simplify the computation considerably, and avoid the need to implement quadratic formulae and assumptions on call rates.

So, in summary, the total number of students who didn't make the cut is 17 (z), and the number of boys and girls who didn't make the cut is the same (let's assume it's 8.5 for simplicity). This leaves us with a total of 39 - 8.5 = 30.5 girls, and 27.5 boys (of the 31.5 boys who tried out).

{The final answer is: The number of students (both girls and boys) who did not make the cut is 17. Out of the total number of students who tried out (43), 26 were called back, leaving the remaining 17 students who didn't make the cut (the numbers of girls and boys who didn't make the cut are not explicitly given, so we assumed them to be equal to simplify the computation). From this, we can further calculate the numbers of girls and boys who didn't make the cut, which we estimated to be around 8.5 each (assumptions based on simplifications). This leaves us with a total number of 30.5 girls (of the 39 who tried out) and 27.5 boys (of the 31.5 who tried out) who were not called back. }</s>",17,17.0,31.5

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of conservation of number. This principle states that the total number of objects in a system remains constant, although the distribution of those objects may change.

Let's define some variables to keep track of Faye's coloring books:
- B = original number of coloring books
- D = number of coloring books Faye donated
- N = number of coloring books Faye subsequently bought
- X = final number of coloring books Faye has

Using these variables, we can represent Faye's situation before any actions occurred:
B = 34

After Faye donated D coloring books, the situation changed:
B - D = X - (D + N)

But this is an equation with four unknowns (B, D, N, X), which is too many to solve without any additional information.

The question prompts us with another piece of information: how many more coloring books (N) did Faye subsequently buy. Let's introduce the variable M to represent the number of coloring books she initially bought, and notice that N = M - D, since she bought M total after donating D books:
B - D = X - (D + M - D)

Our equation now has three variables (B, D, X) and two equations (B = 34 and X = B - D + M - D). We can write this system as a matrix:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many apples the school cafeteria had initially. We can do this by separating the given expression into its constituent parts:

   . school cafeteria ? had, 23 ? apples.

   Let's say the school's name is X, then the expression above can be represented as:

   X had 23 - apples.

   Now, to find the initial number of apples, substitute 'X' with the actual school's name and solve:

   . School cafeteria (let's say . is Lincoln), had 23 - apples.

   We don't know the exact value of 'apples' yet, so let's take it as an unknown 'x':

   Lincoln had 23 - x apples.

2. Next, we know that 20 apples were used to make lunches for . students. Let's find out how many students that is (let's say the school's name is Y):

   Y used 20 apples.

   The number of students is unknown, let's take that as 'y':

   Y used 20 apples for y students.

3. After lunch, .bought some more apples, which we again don't know. Let's take that as 'z', and represent that as:

   . Bought z apples.

4. Finally, we can use what we already know to find out the total number of apples:

   Total number of apples = Initial number of apples - Apples used for lunches + Apples bought afterwards.

   Or,

   Total number of apples = Initial number of apples - Apples used for lunches + Buyer's additional apples.

   Writing this down using our already established variables:

   Total number of apples = Number of apples at Lincoln's cafeteria - Number of apples used for lunches at Y's school + Number of apples .bought.

5. After substituting our variables, we finally have our expression:

   Total number of apples = 23 - x - 20y + z.

   Now we can simply find the total number of apples at Lincoln's cafeteria and our answer will be: 

   {The final answer is}.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Solution:

1. For each enemy defeated, we earn 9! points in the game. Let's call this number of points x.
2. There are n11 enemies in a level. When we defeat all enemies, we earn n11x points.
3. In this case, we don't kill all enemies. After defeating 8 out of 11 enemies, we earn (n11 - 8) * x points.
4. To find the remaining enemies which we didn't kill, we subtract the number of enemies we destroyed from the total number of enemies. So, the remaining enemies are 3.
5. Now we calculate the points we earn from these 3 remaining enemies. Each enemy gives us 9! points. So we earn 3 * 9! points from these remaining enemies.
6. Therefore, by combining steps 3 and 5, the total number of points we earn is: (n11 - 8) * x + 3 * 9! points.
7. Let's simplify this formula. We get: (n11 - 8) * x + 27 points.
8. We have already determined that each enemy gives us 9! points. Since this gives us an ugly expression, let's simplify (9!) again by finding common factors: (n11 - 8) * x + 27 * 9! / 9 * x * 9! / 9.
9. By combining steps 1, 7 and 8, we get the total number of points we earn after we defeat some enemies in the game is: (n11 * 9! - 8 * 9!) * x / 9 + 3 * 9! / 9.
10. Final Answer: The total number of points we earn after defeating some enemies in the game is (n11 * x * 9! - 8 * x * 9!) / 9 + 3 * x * 9! / 9. To indicate the final answer, you can say, ""After defeating some enemies in the game, we earn (n11 * x * 9! - 8 * x * 9!) / 9 + 3 * x * 9! / 9 points.""</s>",72,72.0,9.0

                    ,  ! Megan ? earned , 8 points ! for each bag ? of cans ; she recycled. . If she ! had 14 bags, . but didn't recycle 5 ? of ; them, how many ? points ! would she have earned? , 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps using logical reasoning.

1. First, let's define some variables:
   - p = number of points Megan earns for each bag of cans (given as ! p ! = 8 points)
   - b = number of bags Megan recycles (given as ! b ! = 14)
   - x = number of bags Megan does not recycle (given as x = 5 and ! x ! = ! 14 - 5 ! = 9)

2. We know that for every bag Megan recycles, she earns p points. So, the total number of points Megan earns for recycling all b bags is:
   - b * p points

3. Now we need to subtract the points Megan doesn't earn from the bags she didn't recycle (x). This means we subtract p points for each bag, since that's what she would have earned for each of these bags if she had recycled them. So, the total number of points Megan loses for not recycling x bags is:
   - p * x points

4. Putting together the points Megan earns for recycling and the points she loses for not recycling, we get Megan's total number of points:
   - Total points earned = b * p - p * x points

5. Substituting the given values, we get:
   - Total points earned = 14 * 8 - 5 * 8 points
   - Total points earned = 112 - 40 points
   - Total points earned = 72 points

6. Let's be careful to indicate the final answer clearly, using the symbol ! for emphasis, as requested in the problem statement:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to identify and replace the unknown variables (denoted by question marks) with known values. 

We will replace the variables as follows:

- Discount: Let's say the discount is x%. 

- Flowers: Let's say there are y flowers. 

- Was having a sale: Let's say there is a sale price sp, and the original price is op. 

- Each ! rose: Let's say there are z roses for $4. 

- April started with 13 flowers: We can represent this as y = 13. 

- x roses left: Let's say April had x roses left. 

Now, let's substitute the values we've identified into the original text:

: : April's x% discount flowers : were . having a sale ? where each z! rose ? was 4 dollars. ! If April started . With 13 ? roses and had . X ! roses ? left, . How , much ! money did she earn? ! 

We can assume that there was a sale (?) because the sale price of each ! rose is given as $4. However, whether there was a sale on all flowers, or only on the ! roses, we're not sure.

We can also assume that the discount applies to all flowers, as April started with 13 flowers and has some left when she has sold 4. This means that the price of the remaining (y-x) flowers will be affected by the discount.

To find the sale price of each ! rose, we can substitute the values and calculate sp as follows:

z! roses: sp = original price (op) - discount = op(1 - x/100)

Since each ! rose costs $4, we can find the original price of each ! rose:

z! roses: op = $4 / (1 - x/100)

We can substitute the original price of each ! rose into the calculation for the total amount April earned:

! Money earned: Total amount earned = op(y-x)/100 + x(op(1-x/100))/100 + (y-x-x)($4)

We can substitute the values into this final equation to find the amount April earned:

! Money earned: Total amount earned = y(op)(1-x/100)/100 + (y-x)($4)

Now let's substitute the values:

y = 13, op = $4 / (1 - x/100), x = ?, y-x = 9:

! Money earned: Total amount earned = 13($4) / (1 - x/100) + 9($4)

Expanding the equation, we have:

! Money earned: Total amount earned = $52 + $36(1 - x/100)

Finally, we need to solve for x:

! Money earned: $36(1 - x/100) = $16

$x/100 = 1 - 16/36

$x = 92 - 16

x = 76 flowers

So, the equation simplifies to:

! Money earned: Total amount earned = $52 + $76($4)

! Money earned: Total amount earned = $276

So, the final answer is:

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the given information using mathematical expressions. First, let's represent the number of short sleeve shirts Ned washed as S and the number of long sleeve shirts as L.

S represents the number of short sleeve shirts that Ned washed. We are given that Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts before school, so we know that S is at least 9.

L represents the number of long sleeve shirts that Ned washed. We are given that Ned had to wash 21 long sleeve shirts before school, and we can calculate the total number of long sleeve shirts by multiplying the number before school with 21.

L = 21 * (number of long sleeve shirts before school)

Let's call the number of long sleeve shirts before school X.

X represents the number of long sleeve shirts Ned had before washing any. We can find X by subtracting the number of long sleeve shirts Ned washed before school (which we've represented as Y) from the total number of long sleeve shirts he had (which we've already calculated using L).

X = Total number of long sleeve shirts - Y

Now, let's represent the number of long sleeve shirts Ned washed later as Z.

We are given that Ned had to wash all of his shirts before school started, which means that S, X - Y, and Z are all positive integer values.

Let's use this information to create a system of linear equations in terms of S, X, Y, and Z.

S = 9 (Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts before school)

X - Y = 21 (The number of long sleeve shirts Ned had before washing any should equal the number he washed before school)

L = 21 * X (The total number of long sleeve shirts)

Z = L - X + Y (The number of long sleeve shirts Ned washed later should equal the difference between L and the number of long sleeve shirts before washing any plus the number he washed before school)

S' = S + Z (Ned washed a total of S short sleeve shirts and Z long sleeve shirts, so the total number of shirts he washed should be S + Z)

Let's find a value for X in terms of Y (which is the number of long sleeve shirts Ned washed before school) from the 2nd equation.

X = Y + 21

Let's substitute this value of X into the equation L = 21 * X to get a new expression for L in terms of Y. From here on, we're solving for Y.

L = 21 * (Y + 21)

Let's solve the system using the technique of elimination:

1. Multiply the first equation by 21 and subtract the result from the third equation. This eliminates X and Z from the new system.

  21 * S = 441 * Y + 21 * Z - (441 * Y + 441 * Z)

   L = 441 * Y - (441 * Y - 21 * Z)

   L = Y * (441 - 21) + Z * (-21)

   L = 420 * Y - 21 * Z

   Now, let's multiply the third equation by -21 to eliminate Z from the second equation. The result has been simplified below.

2. Multiply the third equation by -21.

   Z = -21 * X + 21 * Y

   Substitute the expression for X we found earlier into this.

   Z = -21 * (Y + 21) + 21 * Y

   Z = -21 * 21 - 420 * Y

   Z = -909 * Y - 21

3. Now, compare the coefficients of Y in L = 420 * Y - 21 * Z (obtained in step 1) and Z = -909 * Y - 21 (obtained in step 2).

   By setting these coefficients equal to each other and solving for Y, we should be able to find the number of long sleeve shirts Ned didn't wash.

4. Set L and Z equal to their corresponding expressions",1,1.0,4.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. First, let's simplify the expression ""A company invited 47 people to a luncheon"" by writing it as 47 is the number of people invited.

2. Next, we're given some information about who did and didn't show up for the luncheon: 7 out of every 10 people didn't show up. Using algebraic notation, we can write this as 7/10 of the people who were invited did not show up.

3. But, we also know that out of the people who were invited, some did show up and sat at tables with seats for 5 people each. Let's call the number of people who showed up ""x"" and the number of tables that were needed ""y.""

4. Now, we can use the fact that if each table seats 5 people and there are x people who showed up, there must be x/5 tables required.

5. Combining the information we have so far, we can write:
    - 47 is the number of people invited.
    - 7/10 of the invited did not show up, leaving (47 - 7/10 * 47) people total who did show up.
    - The number of tables they needed is equal to the number of people who showed up divided by 5, since each table seated 5 people.
    - The number of tables they needed equals the number of people they invited divided by the average number of people per table. In other words, y = 47 / (x/5).

6. Combining steps 5 and 4, we get:
    - y = (47 - 7/10 * 47) / (x/5)

7. The final answer can be found by solving for x. Substituting y from equation 6 into the equation we found for y, and simplifying:
    - (x/5) * 5 = (47 - 7/10 * 47) / (7/10)
    - x = (47 * 7) / 3
    - The final answer is: x = 141 people showed up.

8. Finally, to find how many tables were needed, we can use equation 6 from step 5:
    - y = (47 - 7/10 * 47) / (x/5)
    - Substituting x from step 7, we get:
    - y = (47 * 3 * 5) / ((47 - 7) * 7)
    - This simplifies to: y = 5
    - The final answer is: 5 tables were needed.

In conclusion, out of the 47 people who were invited, 141 (3 out of every 10) actually showed up and they all ended up sitting at 5 tables. So we'd need 5 tables to accommodate everyone who came.</s>",8,8.0,5.0

1. Tom originally had a number of books that can be represented by the expression x! 5 : books. This expression is read as ""x factorial [!] divided by 5 factorial [: books]"". Factorials are abbreviated as ""!"" and represent multiplying a number by all the positive integers less than it. So, the number of ways to choose 5 books out of a total number of books is given by taking the factorial of the total number of books and dividing it by the factorials of the number of books we want (in this case, 5). Therefore, the expression can be simplified as follows:

   x * (x-1) * (x-2) * (x-3) * (x-4) = 5!

2. Because Tom sold q books, the number of books he has left is equal to the number of books he originally had, less the number of books he sold. We can represent this using a formula:

   Original number of books = Number of books sold + Number of books left

   x = q + Number of books left

3. We can now find the number of books Tom sold by substituting the number of books left that we will find later into this equation:

   x = q + Number of books left

4. After selling some of his books, some of the proceeds went toward his vacation, leaving a remainder, r, to spend on new books. The total amount he earned, T, from selling the books can be represented using the following expression:

   T = q * price per book

   q is the number of books sold, and price per book is the price at which Tom sells each book.

5. We can subtract the price Tom spent on his vacation from the total amount he earned to find the money he has left to spend on new books. This can be represented by the following expression:

   L = T - amount spent on vacation = T - d

   d is the amount spent on the vacation.

6. Tom then purchased new books with the money left after his vacation. The number of new books he purchased, n, can be found by taking the number of books left after selling his old books, subtracting the number of new books he purchased, and adding the number of old books he used after his vacation:

   Number of new books purchased = n

   Number of old books used after vacation = u

   Total number of books = n + u + Number of books left after selling old books

   Number of books left after selling old books = Number of books left after selling old books - n

7. The formula for simplifying expressions with factorials is known as the binomial theorem. It allows us to represent large numbers by breaking the multiplication down into smaller calculations:

    (a + b)! = a! * b! * Combination(a, b)

   where Combination(a, b) is the number of ways to choose b objects from a set of a objects.

   Now we’re ready to find the number of ways Tom could have ended up with the amount of books he started with given the information presented:

8. If Tom originally had x books and sold q books, we already know how to find the number of books left:

   Number of books left = Number of books originally had - Number of books sold

   Number of books left = x - q

9. After his vacation, Tom spent an unknown amount, d, on his vacation. Tom purchased n new books with the money he had left over:

   Total number of books he had after vacation = Number of books left after selling + Number of new books purchased

   Total number of books he had after vacation = (x - q) + n

10. After his vacation, Tom had u remaining old books:

   Total number of books = New books + Old books after vacation

   Total number of books = n + u + (x - q)

11. We want to find the number of ways Tom could have had the same number of books that he started with, given the information present:

   Number of books he had = Number of old books and new books he could have acquired

   Number of books he had = Combination(Number of old books left after selling, Number of old books used), Combination(Number of old books left after selling, Total number of new books without the books he used) * Combination(",39,39.0,11.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:
1. Calculate the total number of sodas Jerry bought.
2. Divide this number between regular and diet sodas.
3. Calculate the number of regular sodas that fit on each shelf.
4. Calculate the number of shelves Jerry needs to fill his fridge.

Let's begin:
1. Total number of sodas: Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. The total number of sodas can be found by adding the number of regular and diet sodas.

41 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = total number of sodas

The total number of sodas Jerr bought is 63 (41 + 22).

2. Number of regular sodas: Jerry bought 41 regular sodas.

Number of regular sodas = 41

3. Number of regular sodas per shelf: We are not given information on how many sodas fit on a shelf. However, we are given information that Jerry's fridge can hold 9 regular sodas per shelf.

Number of regular sodas per shelf = 9

4. Number of shelves needed: We know that Jerry bought a total of 41 regular sodas. We also know that each shelf holds 9 regular sodas. Dividing the total number of regular sodas by the number of regular sodas per shelf tells us how many shelves are needed to store all of the regular sodas.

Number of shelves needed for regular sodas = Total number of regular sodas / Number of regular sodas per shelf

Number of shelves needed for regular sodas = 41 / 9

The final step requires us to consider the number of shelves needed for both regular and diet sodas. However, we are not given this information. Therefore, our final answer will only be for the number of shelves needed for regular sodas. Our answer is as follows:

{The final answer is: Jerry will need approximately 4.55 shelves to fit all of his regular sodas in his fridge, assuming each shelf can hold 9 regular sodas.}

If we round up, we can say that Jerry will need approximately 5 shelves to hold all of his regular sodas in the fridge. However, if the fridge can't store 9 sodas per shelf, we'll need to adjust our calculation based on how many regular sodas fit on each shelf.</s>",7,7.0,9.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can approach it step by step using basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

Step 1: Find the total number of candy Debby and her sister have.

The problem provides us with the number of candies each of them has. Debby has 32 candies, and her sister has 42 candies. We can add these two numbers to find out the total number of candies they have.

Total number of candy = Number of candies Debby has + Number of candies Debby's sister has

Total number of candy = 32 + 42

Total number of candy = 74

Step 2: Find the number of candies they ate on the first night.

The problem tells us that they ate 35 candies on the first night. This information we have is independent of any other calculations. It doesn't need to be done after Step 1.

Number of candies they ate on the first night = 35

Step 3: Find the number of candies they have left after eating 35 candies on the first night.

To solve this step, we use subtraction. The total number of candies (74) minus the number of candies they ate on the first night (35) gives us the number of candies they have left.

Number of candies they have left = Total number of candies - Number of candies they ate on the first night

Number of candies they have left = 74 - 35

Number of candies they have left = 49

The final answer is: After eating 35 candies on the first night, Debbie and her sister have 49 candies left in total.</s>",39,39.0,49.0

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the missing words:
   - Emily was planting vegetables in her ____ garden.
   - She started with ____ 41! seeds and planted ____ of them, in ____ the ____ big garden and : in each ____ of her : small gardens ____ put ____ seeds each.
2. Fill in the missing words:
   - Emily was planting vegetables in her back garden.
   - She started with 41! seeds (41 times 41 is a lot of seeds, so we use the exponentiation symbol ""!"" to represent this) and planted 29 of them, in each of her 7 big gardens (we'll call the big garden ""big"" for now) and : in each of her 4 small gardens (we'll call the small garden ""small"") ____ put ____ seeds each.
3. Solve for the number of seeds planted in the big gardens:
   - The total number of seeds planted in the big gardens is 29 times the number of big gardens, which we'll call ""x"". Mathematically, this can be written as 29x = 41! - 29, where -29 accounts for the seeds planted in the small gardens.
4. Solve for the number of seeds planted in each small garden:
   - The total number of seeds planted in all the small gardens is 4 times the number of small gardens, which we'll call ""y"". Mathematically, this can be written as 4y = 41! - 29x.
5. Solve for the number of seeds planted in each big garden:
   - The number of seeds planted in each big garden is the same, since Emily planted the same number of seeds in each of the big gardens. Let's call this ""z"". Mathematically, this can be written as z = 29/x.
6. Calculate the total number of big gardens:
   - The total number of big gardens can be calculated by dividing the total number of seeds planted in the big gardens by the number of seeds planted in each big garden. Mathematically, this can be written as x = (41! - 29)/(29*z).
7. Calculate the total number of seeds planted in the big gardens:
   - The total number of seeds planted in the big gardens is equal to the number of big gardens times the number of seeds planted in each big garden. Mathematically, this can be written as x*z = 29*z.
8. Calculate the total number of seeds planted:
   - The total number of seeds planted is the sum of the seeds planted in the big gardens and the seeds planted in the small gardens. Mathematically, this can be written as 41! - 29 = 29x + 4y.
9. Simplify the equation:
   - Substitute the expression for x and y in terms of z:
   - x = (41! - 29)/(29*z)
   - y = (41! - 29x)/(4*z)
   - Rearrange the equation:
   - 41! - 29 = 29z^2 + 4(41! - 29)/(4*z)
   - Remove the parentheses and group terms:
   - 41! - 29z^2 - (41! - 29)/z = 0
10. Solve the quadratic equation:
   - The quadratic equation can be solved using the quadratic formula:
   - z = (-(41! - 29) ± sqrt(4(41! - 29)^2 - 4(41! - 29)(-41! + 29)))/(-2*4)
   - Simplify the expression inside the square root sign:
   - w = (41! - 29)^2 - (41! - 29)(-41! + 29)
   - Simplify the quadratic formula:

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps using logic and algebra.

Let's first understand what the question is asking us. Emily received a total of n candies from her neighbors and 13 candies from her older sister. She ate q candies a day, and we want to find out how many days it would take her to finish all the candy if she ate only the candies she received from her neighbors and her older sister.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can find an answer:

Step 1: Find the total number of candies Emily received from her neighbors and her older sister.

Let n be the number of candies Emily received from her neighbors and x be the number of candies she received from her older sister (13). Then:

n + x = ! 5 ! candies (total number of candies Emily received)

Step 2: Find the total number of candies Emily ate from her neighbors and her older sister.

Let q be the number of candies Emily ate a day, and let d be the number of days it took her to finish all the candy. Then:

q * d = n * 9 + x * d (number of candies Emily ate in d days)

Step 3: Solve the system of equations we created in Steps 1 and 2.

Combining the equations from Steps 1 and 2, we can create two equations with two unknowns (n and x):

n + x = ! 5 ! (Equation 1)

q * d = 9 * n + x * d (Equation 2)

We can use algebra to isolate the variables in each equation, and then substitute one equation into the other to create a new equation with only one variable. This process is called solving a system of linear equations by substitution.

Solving by substitution:

First, let's isolate x in Equation 1:

x = ! 5 ! - n

Next, substitute this expression for x into Equation 2:

q * d = 9 * n - 13 * (! 5 ! - n) * d

Simplify the right side:

q * d = -13 * n * d + 9 * d * n

Factor:

q * d = (9 * d * n - 13 * d * n)

Factoring out common terms:

q * d = d * (9 * n - 13 * n)

Factor again:

q * d = d * (-6 * n)

We can then simplify by dividing both sides by d (which is negative):

q = -6 * n

We can't do this yet, as n is still unknown. However, substituting q back into Equation 2, we can find q in terms of n:

q = -6 * n

Now, we can substitute this into Equation 2 to find an expression for d in terms of n:

-6 * n * d = d * (9 * n - 13 * n)

Simplify by dividing both sides by d (which is negative):

-6 * n = 9 * n - 13 * n

Simplify:

3 * n = 13 * n

Finally, divide both sides by n:

3 = 13

Since that's not possible, we know that this system of equations does not have a solution. In other words, the number of candies Emily received from her neighbors cannot be found because we started with a false assumption (that she only ate candies from her neighbors and her older sister).

Therefore, we cannot find a practical answer to the original question.

{The final answer is that the number of candies Emily received from her neighbors cannot be found because there is a contradiction in the original question's assumptions.}</s>",2,2.0,13.0

<|assistant|>
Firstly, we can identify that ""Mike"" and ""! (pronounced as ""bang"")"" are two individuals. ""! (bang)"" is currently at the library helping ""!"" (pronounced as ""bang"") put away books. The number of books being put away is not explicitly mentioned, but we will assume it is a finite number for now.

Next, we learn that there are a total of 82 books in the library. Some of these books are being put away by ""! (bang)"", while some are being taken care of by another librarian. The number of books being taken care of by the other librarian is not mentioned, but we do know that ""! (bang)"" leaves Mike with the remaining number of books once the other librarian has finished.

To find the number of books taken care of by the other librarian, we can use the information that ""!"" (bang) leaves Mike with the remaining books. This tells us that the total number of books left with Mike is equal to the remaining books. We also know that 10 of these remaining books are being taken care of by the other librarian. Therefore, we can write this as an equation:

Total books left with Mike = Remaining books - Number of books being taken care of by the other librarian (10)

82 (Total number of books) = (Remaining books) - 10 (Number of books being taken care of by the other librarian)

Next, we have some information about how quickly ""!"" (bang) can put away books. We know that ""!"" (bang) can fit 9 books on each shelf. We don't know how many shelves ""!"" (bang) needs, but we can use the information we have to find the number of shelves needed. The number of books currently being put away by ""!"" (bang) is unknown, but we do know the rate at which ""!"" (bang) can put away books.

Let's say ""!"" (bang) can fit 9 books on one shelf and there are ""x"" number of shelves. This means that ""!"" (bang) can put away a total of 9x books.

Next, we know that once ""!"" (bang) has finished putting away books, ""!"" (bang) leaves Mike with the remaining number of books. Let's say these remaining books after ""!"" (bang) has finished put them away is ""y"" number of books.

Now, we can create an equation to find the relationship between ""x"" and ""y"":

The total number of books that ""!"" (bang) has put away + The total number of books that ""!"" (pronounced as ""bang"") and the other librarian have put away = The total number of books (""82"")

9x (Number of books that ""!"" (bang) puts away) + (Number of books the other librarian puts away) = 82

But we know the number of books ""!"" (bang) leaves Mike with:

y (The number of remaining books left with Mike) = (Number of books that Mike has to put away) + (Number of books the other librarian puts away)

y = 82 - (9x + (Number of books the other librarian puts away))

Now, we have three equations with three unknowns (""x"", ""y"", and ""Number of books the other librarian puts away""). We can use a system of equations to find the values of these three unknowns.

Let's label the three equations as equation 1, equation 2, and equation 3, respectively:

Equation 1: 82 = (Remaining books) - 10 

Equation 2: 9x = (Number of books that ""!"" (bang) puts away)

Equation 3: y = 82 - (9x + (Number of books the other librarian puts away))

We can now use a mathematical technique called the Gaussian elimination to get the unique values of our three unknowns. This technique allows us to solve a system of simultaneous linear equations by transforming the system such that the coefficient of the variable we want to eliminate in one equation becomes zero. 

Let's take equation 2, 9x = (Number of books that ""!"" (bang) puts away), and replace it in equation 3 to eliminate variable ""x"":

   - At the zoo: ! 49
   - At the museum: ! 8
   Total: ! (49 + 49 + 8) = ! 106

2. Later, Nancy deleted 38 photographs. Let's find how many pictures she deleted from each location:
   - At the hotel: Let's call this number x
   - At the zoo: Let's call this number y
   - At the museum: Let's call this number z
   - Now, let's find the number of pictures Nancy deleted in total: 
     38 = x + y + z
   - We can see that there are ! 38 ways to delete 38 pictures, but we don't require all of them, hence we can assume that we are choosing unique pictures.

3. Let's now find the number of pictures Nancy still has from each location:
   - At the hotel: ! 49 - x
   - At the zoo: ! 49 - y
   - At the museum: ! 8 - z

4. Let's add up the number of pictures Nancy still has from all three locations to find the total number of pictures she still has:
   - Total number of pictures Nancy still has:

5. Our final answer is:
   - The total number of pictures that Nancy still has from her vacation is ! 26.

The final answer is: ! 26.

In summary, we found the number of pictures that Nancy took at each location, the number of pictures she deleted at each location, and then identified the number of pictures she still has from each location, and finally calculated the total number of pictures she still has from all locations.</s>",19,19.0,26.0

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

   - new: the number of new windows that need to be installed (the builder has already installed 8)
   - building: the building in question
   - the builder: the person installing the windows
   - takes: the amount of time it takes to install one window

2. Next, we translate the given information into mathematical expressions.
   - The builder has already installed 8 windows.
   - new = 14 - 8 (we can find the number of new windows by subtracting the number of already-installed windows from the total number needed)
   - ! it: the person installing the windows (a shorthand notation, as the problem uses it repeatedly)
   - ! takes: the time it takes to install one window

3. We calculate the time it takes the builder to install the new windows.
   - To find this, we multiply the number of new windows (new) by the time it takes to install one window (! it: takes).
   - Time to install new windows: new * ! it: takes

4. We determine how many windows the builder has already installed.
   - To do this, we add the number of already-installed windows (8) to the number of new windows installed so far (we assume the builder has been consistently working on installing the windows).

5. We find out how many windows the builder has left to install.
   - To do this, we subtract the total number of windows installed so far (from step 4) from the total number of windows needed (14).

6. Finally, we calculate how long it will take the builder to complete the remaining window installations, including the new ones.
   - To do this, we add the time it takes to install the already-installed windows (from step 4) to the time it takes to install the new windows (from step 3), and divide the sum by the number of windows the builder has left to install (from step 5).

! - q = 30 (given that 25 old oranges were thrown away)

We can see that initially there were 40 oranges, of which 25 were old. After throwing away the old oranges, there are 30 oranges left (30 of which are new oranges).

! - q = 40 - 25 = 30

! = 40 (original number of oranges)

q = 25 (number of old oranges thrown away)

n = 21 (number of new oranges put in the bin)

3. Calculate the number of new oranges left:

n = 30 - 21

n = 9

However, we know that after throwing away the old oranges, all the oranges left are new oranges. Therefore, there are no ""old"" oranges left, and n represents the total remaining number of oranges, which is also ! - q.

n = ! - q

Substitute the value of n:

9 = ! - 25

4. Solve for the total number of oranges, !:

! = 9 + 25

! = 34

The final answer is ! = 34.

{The final answer is 34.}

In our bin, there are 34 oranges (including the new ones that we just put in). Hope that helps!</s>",36,36.0,34.0

1. We are given that the waiter had 7 customers at lunch.
2. Of those 7 customers, 5 did not leave a tip.
3. The waiter received $3 for each of the 2 customers who did leave a tip.
4. We don't know how much each customer left as a tip, but we know that the total amount tips left by the 2 customers who did leave a tip is $0 (because no tips were left for the 5 customers who did not).
5. To find out how much the waiter earned, we need to calculate the total amount he received for the meals and tips.
6. The amount for the meals is the same for all customers, since the problem doesn't specify any pricing variations.
7. Therefore, we can find the amount for the meals by multiplying the total number of customers (7) by the amount received per customer (we'll use $x as a placeholder for this amount).
8. The amount for the tips is the sum of the tips left by the 2 customers who did leave a tip.
9. We don't know how much each customer left as a tip, but we do know that the total tips left by the 2 customers is $0.
10. Since we're working with decimals, we'll assume that the tip percentage is a decimal. Let's say it's x%.
11. The amount left as a tip by the first customer is this person's meal price multiplied by the tip percentage.
12. The amount left as a tip by the second customer is this person's meal price multiplied by the tip percentage.
13. The total amount left as tips by both customers is the sum of the tips left by each customer.
14. Let's set this amount equal to 0 by subtracting it from the total tips left by the two customers.
15. Substitute our formula for total tips left into the expression for the total tips left by the two customers who did leave a tip.
16. Combine like terms.
17. Set this expression equal to 0.
18. Solve for the tip percentage.
19. Substitute this value into our expression for the total tips left by the two customers who did leave a tip.
20. Use our expression for the total tips left by the two customers to calculate the amount left as a tip by each customer.
21. Add the meal prices and the amounts left as tips to find the total amount received from the two customers (i.e., the total amount the waiter earned for their meals).
22. Add this value to the amount received from the other 5 customers (the meal price for each, with no tips) to find the total amount received from all 7 customers (i.e., the total amount the waiter earned).

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break this question down into smaller steps:

1. Faye scored a total of 47 pieces of candy for Halloween. (We can call this quantity Q.)
2. On the first night, Faye ate 25 pieces of candy. (Let this be represented by x.)
3. Faye's sister then gave her 40 more pieces of candy. (Let this be represented by y.)

Now, let's put this into a system of equations. We have two unknowns (x and y) and two equations that relate to these unknowns. The system looks like this:

x + y = 25 (The number of pieces Faye ate on the first night was 25.)
Q = x + y (The total number of pieces Faye has, which we called Q, is equal to the number of pieces she ate on the first night plus the number of pieces her sister gave her.)

Let's solve this system of equations. This can be done graphically, but we will solve it algebraically here.

To solve this system, we need to find a way to eliminate one of the variables (x or y) so that we're left with just one equation with one variable. We can do this by multiplicating one equation by a constant (a number multiplied by 1) to create another equation that eliminates one variable.

In this case, we can multiply the first equation (x+y=25) by -1 to create the second equation:

-x - y = -25

This will give us a new system:

-x - y = -25
Q = x + y

Now, we'll use the method of substitution to combine these two systems into one equation featuring one variable (Q). We'll replace x and y using the first equation and then solve for Q.

Start by plugging x and y from the first equation into the second equation (which we call equation 2):

Q = -1 x -1 y - 25

Now, distribute the negative terms in equation 2 throughout the equation.

Q = x - y - 25

At this point, we can isolate Q by moving the left-hand side of the equation to the left and the right-hand side to the right.

Q + 25 = x - y

Finally, we can find the value of Q by bringing Q to the left-hand side of the equation.

Q = x - y - 25

Let's define some variables to make this equation clearer.

Q = the total number of pieces Faye has now
x = the number of pieces Faye ate on the first night
y = the number of pieces Faye's sister gave her

Here's the complete solution:

Q = x - y - 25 {The final answer is}

Now, we can substitute the values for x and y that we found earlier into our equation for Q. Recall that x = 25 and y = 40.

Q = 25 - 40 - 25 = 0

Now that we know Q is zero, we can substitute it back into our original equation for y to find the final number of pieces that Faye has now (represented by Q).

Q = x + y = 0

x + 0 = 0

x = 0

But we already know that x is the number of pieces Faye ate on the first night. We know that Faye ate 25 pieces on the first night, so let's replace x with 25.

25 + y = Q (where Q is the total number of pieces Faye has now)

We'll use our earlier solution that Q is equal to 0:

25 + y = 0

Now, we'll isolate y by moving 25 and y to the left and Q to the right.

y = -25

Let's look at our system again, and you'll see that we've solved it entirely.

x + y = 25
Q = x + y

We solved it by finding the values of x and y, after which, we found out the total number of pieces that Faye has now (Q). Our final answer is as follows:

Q = -25 {The final answer is}

So, in other words, Faye doesn't have",62,62.0,25.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent unknown quantities using variables and use algebraic reasoning to find their values. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Identify the variables:
   - ! represents the number of friends
   - ! represents the number of chicken wings prepared by the chef before the friends arrived
   - x represents the number of chicken wings cooked for the group of friends

2. Write equations based on the information provided:
   - The number of chicken wings prepared by the chef before the friends arrived plus the number cooked for the friends equals the total number of chicken wings:
      !  + x = 9
   - The number of chicken wings each friend receives is the same, and it's equal to the number of chicken wings cooked for the group divided by the number of friends:
      x / ! = ?

3. Eliminate the variable x from the equations:
   - Multiply both sides of the second equation by ! to get:
      ! * x / ! = ? * !
   - Simplify to get:
      x = ? * !
   - Substitute this expression for x in the first equation:
      ! + ? * ! = 9

4. Solve for !:
   - Divide both sides by the value of ?:
      (1/?) * ! + ? * ! = 9
   - Simplify:
      (1/?) * ! = 0
   - This equation is true for any value of ? as long as the number of friends is non-zero. But, since we only have the value of ! and ? for the remaining part of the question, we cannot solve further without any additional information.

5. Solve for ?:
   - Use the fact that each friend receives the same number of chicken wings:
      x = ? * !
   - Substitute the expression for x from the previous step:
      ? * ! = ? * !
   - Divide both sides of the equation by ?:
      ! = !
   - The number of chicken wings cooked is equal to the number of friends, so this expression is always true.

6. Identify the final answer:
   - Unfortunately, we cannot find a unique solution for the unknown variables, as there are too many unknowns with insufficient information provided.

The final answer is that it's impossible to determine the specific number of friends and chicken wings cooked in this scenario due to the lack of sufficient information.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can approach it in a step-by-step manner. Here is how:

1. First, we notice that we have a formula for calculating how much John earns per lawn he mows. The formula is given to us: x dollars per lawn.

2. We also know how much he earns in total: $112 for 15 lawns. This leads us to the following equation to help us find x:

   x * 15 = 112
   
3. We are also given some additional information - that John forgot to mow 7 of the 15 lawns originally planned. In this case, we know that the number of lawns John actually mowed is 15 - 7, or 8.

4. Now we need to find out how much money John would've earned if he mowed all 15 lawns. Using our formula and the original 15-lawn scenario, we can calculate this:

   x * 15 = 112
   
5. Next, we determine how much money John made from mowing the remaining 8 lawns. This isn't explicitly given to us, but since we have a formula for each lawn, we can find it. In this case:

   x * 8 = earnings
   
6. Combining the earnings from the former equation and the earnings from these final 8 lawns, we can find John's total earnings:

   1st part earnings: x * 7
   2nd part earnings: x * 8
   
   Total earnings = x * 7 + x * 8
   
7. Finally, we substitute in the numbers we know into our simplified earnings equation:

   x * 7 + x * 8 = $112
   
   Solving for x gives us John's earnings per lawn:

   x = $16
   
   Now that we have the answer to our first, formulaic question, we can substitute this into the original formula for the number of lawns mowed vs. Money earned, in order to calculate how much exactly John earned with the mowed 8 lawns:

   $16 * 8 = $128
   
8. Finally, combining John's earnings from the original 7 lawns (which we've yet to calculate) and the 8 lawns he did mow, we can determine his total earnings:

   $128 (earnings from the 8 lawns) + (earnings from the 7 lawns that were forgotten) = $112 (total earnings)
   
   Solving for the earnings of the forgotten lawns, we can determine how much money John would have earned if he didn't forget to mow those 7 lawns:

   $112 (total earnings) = $16 (earnings per lawn) * 8 (lawns mowed) + $16 (earnings per lawn) * 7 (added forgotten lawns)
   
9. And so, substituting numbers for the forgotten lawns, we find that John would have earned an additional $112 from those lawns, for a total of $224. It's a good thing he realized his mistake and went back to fix them up!
   
The final answer is that John would have earned $224 if he hadn't forgotten to mow those 7 lawns.</s>",64,64.0,7.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to use system of linear equations. Here's how:

Let x be the number of puppies at the shelter before the new batch was brought in, and y be the number of puppies after the new batch was brought in.

We have two pieces of information:
1. There were initially a certain number of puppies (x) at the shelter, and there were 5 puppies in total (including x).
2. After bringing in 35 more puppies, there were still x puppies from the initial batch, as well as the 35 new puppies, for a total of y puppies.

Using the first piece of information:
x + 5 = x (cancelling out repeated terms)
x = 5

Using the second piece of information:
x + 35 = y
substituting x = 5:
5 + 35 = y
40 = y

Now we have two linear equations with two unknowns:
x = 5
and
y = 40

To find how long it would take to adopt all the puppies, we need to calculate how many puppies would be adopted in a day (let's call this x'). If we let the number of days it would take to adopt all the puppies be d, then we can set up a third equation:
x' = 8 (number of puppies adopted in a day)
and
d = (total number of puppies) / (number of puppies adopted per day)

Writing this out, we have:

x' = 8
d = (x + y) / 8

To solve this system, we can use matrix methods or graphing techniques, but since we only have three equations with two unknowns, we can also solve it by guessing and checking. Let's guess that d = 2. (This is just a guess, but it will help us solve for x' and y.)

Plug d = 2 into the second equation:
x + 35 = 40 * d
x + 35 = 80
subtracting x from both sides:
35 = 80 - x
dividing both sides by 45:
0.8 = 1 - x/45
rearranging:
x/45 = 1 - 0.8
simplifying:
x/45 = 0.2
multiplying both sides by 45:
x = 9

Now that we know the number of puppies at the shelter is 9, we can substitute this value into the first equation (x = 5) to get two equations with two unknowns (the third equation, which involves a guess, is not strictly required):

x = 5
x + 35 = y

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
35 = y - 5
y = 40

So our two equations are now:

x = 5
y = 40

We know from the third equation that if we adopt 8 puppies per day, it would take 5 puppies (initial batch) plus 35 new puppies (brought in) divided by 8 puppies per day to adopt them all (which is 106.25 days), but we can approximate this value by rounding to 106 days.

Putting it all together:

It would take approximately 106 days to adopt all the puppies if we adopt 8 puppies per day at the shelter, which has an initial batch of 5 puppies, and receives another batch of 35 puppies.</s>",5,5.0,35.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we will follow each step of the reasoning process, as requested.

1. We are given three statements that provide us with some necessary information. Let's read them carefully:

A: new; building: needed 9 windows

The first statement tells us that a new building requires a total of 9 windows.

builder had already installed: 6 of them

The second statement informs us that the builder has already installed 6 out of the required 9 windows.

If it, takes, 6; hours! to install each window, how long; will it take him! to : install ? the rest?

The third statement describes the installation time for a single window. It tells us that it takes 6 hours to install one window.

2. Now let's analyze the situation more deeply. How many windows does the builder still need to install for this new building?

We know that the builder has already installed 6 windows, and the new building requires a total of 9 windows. By subtracting the number of installed windows from the total required, we can calculate the number of uninstalled windows left.

9 windows - 6 windows installed = 3 windows remaining

3. Since we know how many windows are remaining, and we know how long it takes to install a single window, we can calculate how long it will take the builder to install all the uninstalled windows.

Number of remaining windows to be installed = 3 windows

Number of hours to install one window = 6 hours

Total number of hours to install all the remaining windows = Number of hours needed to install all the remaining windows
                                                           = Remaining windows to be installed x Number of hours needed to install one window
                                                               = 3 windows x 6 hours
                                                               = 18 hours

4. Finally, we combine all information to calculate how long it will take the builder to complete the whole installation process, including the installed windows.

Number of hours needed for installed windows = Number of hours already spent on installed windows
                                                            = Installed windows x Number of hours already spent installing each window
                                                            = 6 windows x 0 hours (since the installed windows do not require additional installation time)
                                                            = 0 hours

Number of hours needed for uninstalled windows = Number of hours needed to install all the remaining windows
                                                            = Remaining windows to be installed x Number of hours needed to install one window
                                                            = 3 windows x 6 hours
                                                            = 18 hours

Total number of hours needed for the entire installation process = Total number of hours needed for installed windows + Total number of hours needed for uninstalled windows

To solve this problem, we can translate the steps visually using variables and basic algebraic operations. It may help to read the problem out loud, replacing the words with mathematical symbols, to better understand the steps.

! A teacher ; had 34 worksheets to : grade.!

Let x be the number of worksheets the teacher graded each day.

! If : she graded 7, ; but ! then ? another 36 ? were . turned ; in, ! how many worksheets ! would she : have to grade?

In this first sentence, we are given some background information. We don't know how many worksheets the teacher graded each day, but we do know that she had a total of 34 worksheets to grade.

Now, in the second sentence, we are presented with a statement that seems to contradict the previous information. We'll analyze this sentence more closely:

! If : she graded 7, ; but ! then ? another 36 ? were . turned ; in, ! how many worksheets ! would she : have to grade?

Let's assume that the teacher graded 7 worksheets each day. We'll call this scenario Scenario 1.

Now, let's assume that another 36 worksheets were turned in. Let's call this scenario Scenario 2.

In Scenario 1, the teacher would grade 7 worksheets each day, for a total of 7 * number of days worked. Since we already know that the teacher had 34 worksheets to grade, we can find the number of days the teacher worked by dividing the total number of worksheets she graded (from Scenario 1 alone) by the number of worksheets she graded each day:

number of days worked (from Scenario 1) = 34 / 7

Now, let's assume that Scenario 2 also occurred, on an unknown number of days. Let's call the number of additional worksheets that were turned in x again (to be consistent with our initial variable for the number of worksheets graded each day). We can find the number of additional days worked (in Scenario 2) by dividing the number of additional worksheets turned in by the number of worksheets turned in each day:

number of additional days worked (from Scenario 2) = x / x

Since we are assuming that Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 both occurred, we need to combine the results to get a total number of days worked:

total number of days worked = number of days worked (from Scenario 1) + number of additional days worked (from Scenario 2)

total number of days worked = 34 / 7 + x / x

We don't yet know the value of x, so this is an equation. We'll use it to determine x later.

Now, let's translate the entire problem into mathematical symbols, with appropriate substitutions:

? Let x be the number of worksheets the teacher graded each day.
? In Scenario 1, the teacher graded 7 worksheets each day. Let's call this scenario Scenario 1.
? In Scenario 2, an additional x worksheets were turned in. We don't know how many days this occurred, but we can calculate the number of additional days worked later by dividing the number of additional worksheets turned in by the number of worksheets turned in each day: x days.
? The total number of worksheets the teacher had to grade (from Scenarios 1 and 2 combined) is 34.
? How many worksheets does the teacher have to grade (from Scenarios 1 and 2 combined) if she graded 7 worksheets per day in Scenario 1, and an additional x worksheets per day in Scenario 2?

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
First, we need to identify the unknowns in the problem. The variables we do not know are:

- ? (the game being played at the arcade)
- ! (the name of another game being played)
- Frank's goal (either buying candy or trying to win tickets)
- The cost of each candy (in terms of tickets)

Let's begin by finding out how many tickets Frank won overall. We know he won 33 tickets playing 'whack ! a mole' and 9 tickets playing '!'skee ball'. So, the total number of tickets Frank won is:

33 tickets from 'whack ! a mole'
9 tickets from '!'skee ball'
Total number of tickets = 42 tickets

Next, we need to find out how many candies Frank could buy with the tickets he has left. Suppose Frank's goal is buying candy, let x be the cost of each candy in terms of tickets. Then, Frank could buy x candies with the remaining tickets after buying some number of candies. Let y be the number of candies that Frank bought. The remaining tickets after buying y candies would be:

42 tickets - (number of tickets needed to buy y candies)

We also know that each candy costs 6 tickets. So, the number of tickets needed to buy y candies is:

6 tickets per candy × y candies

So, the remaining tickets after buying y candies is:

42 tickets - (6 tickets × y candies)

Now that we have found out the number of remaining tickets after buying y candies, let's find the value of y. After some calculations, we can arrive at the following equation:

42 - (6 × y) = y

This is a quadratic equation, where y is the independent variable and 42 - (6 × y) is the dependent variable. Let's assume the quadratic equation has a root (the value of y) which is a real number. We can then use the quadratic formula to find the value of y.

y = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)

b = -6, a = 1, and c = -42. Substituting these values in the quadratic formula, we get:

y = (-(-6)) ± √((-6)² - 4(1)(-42)) / (2(1))

Simplifying, we get:

y = 6 ± √468

As the quadratic formula gives us two values of y (because of the ± sign), we can't say which one is the right one without the given context. If Frank was able to buy some number of candies, we can assume that no candies would have been left unopened (i.e., not eaten). In this scenario, the smaller root is the one we are looking for, as it represents the number of candies Frank bought.

y = 6 - √468

Therefore, the final answer to the question is:

Frank could buy 6 - √468 candies (given the assumptions that Frank's goal is buying candy and he could buy some number of candies with the remaining tickets, i.e., Frank bought some number of candies, and no candies are left unopened) {The final answer is}.

However, if the context is otherwise, the other root represents the number of candies Frank can buy with the additional tickets he may earn. In that case, we would have to re-calculate based on the new context.

In our scenario, as we assume Frank bought some number of candies, the final answer is: Frank could buy 6 - √468 candies.</s>",7,7.0,468.0

<|assistant|>
Let's break down the problem and identify the key pieces of information:

- Each adult meal costs $7.
- Kids eat for free.
- A group of 13 people (1 adult and 12 kids) came to the restaurant.

To find out how much it would cost for this group of 13 people to eat, we need to determine how many adult meals were consumed and how many kids' meals were consumed.

Let's say x adult meals were consumed. Then we know that (13 - x) kids' meals were consumed. Since kids eat for free, this gives us:

x adult meals at $7 each: $7x
(13 - x) kids' meals at $0 each: $0
Total cost for the group: $7x

Now, let's substitute the values we know into this formula:

- We know there were 12 kids in the group, so (13 - x) becomes 12.
- So, (13 - x) kids' meals was $0.
- We also know there were 1 adult in the group, so x is 1.

Plugging these values into the formula gives us:

- x adult meals at $7 each: $7 (we can skip this step, since we know exactly how many adult meals were consumed)
- (13 - 1) kids' meals at $0 each: $0

So, the total cost for the group is:

$7 (for the 1 adult meal) + $0 (for the 12 kids' meals) = $7

Putting it all together, we can say that:

The final answer is $7 , which is what it would cost for the group of 13 people (1 adult and 12 kids) to eat at the restaurant, where each adult meal costs $7 and kids eat for free.</s>",28,28.0,7.0

    Math problems: x
    Science problems: y
    Homework problems: z

Next, let's set up an equation based on the given information:

    Science problems at the beginning: 12
    Science problems after completing z for homework: 12 - z

To solve this problem, we can first identify the variables and constants. Let's denote the number of treasures found on the first level as x, and the number of treasures found on the second level as y. We are given that Rachel found 5 treasures on the first level and 2 treasures on the second level, so x = 5 and y = 2. The value of z is unknown, but it represents Rachel's score in the game.

We are also given that Rachel scores 9 points for each treasure found. Therefore, we can represent this as 9 points per treasure, pts/tr.

Next, we can write out an equation for Rachel's score based on the given information. The score from the first level is x * 9 pts/tr, and the score from the second level is y * 9 pts/tr. Adding these scores gives us the total score, which is our desired output:

Total score = (x * 9 pts/tr) + (y * 9 pts/tr)

Putting this equation together with the information we identified earlier, we get:

Total score = (5 * 9 pts/tr) + (2 * 9 pts/tr)

We can simplify this equation further by multiplying out the parentheses:

Total score = (45 points) + (18 points)

Total score = 63 points

 to calculate the number of customers who left a tip, we need to find the difference between the total number of customers who left a tip and the number of customers who didn't leave a tip among the 27 who joined during the lunch rush. Let's call the total number of customers who left a tip as x, and the number of customers who didn't leave a tip among them as y.

We know that y is a subset of the 27 customers who joined during the lunch rush, let's say y = z (z being the number of customers during the lunch rush who didn't leave a tip).

Now, the number of customers who left a tip is x, and the total number of customers who joined during the lunch rush is 27. So, we can say:

x = z + (27 - z) who left a tip

We also know the relationship between this subset of customers (y) and our original group during the lunch rush (B). Since the subset is a subgroup of the initial set, all the elements in y should also be elements of B. Therefore, we can express z as a subset of B, let's say  z = w (w being the number of customers during the lunch rush who didn't leave a tip from the initial group).

Using the same formula above, we can say:

x = w + (27 - w) who left a tip from the initial group

Now, let's find out the total number of customers so far. Let's call it C.

C = A + 26 (initial number of customers)

Finally, using what we've found so far, we can calculate the number of customers who left a tip. Let's call it D.

D = x

Putting everything together, we have:

D = w + (27 - w) who left a tip from the initial group

C = A + 26 (initial number of customers)

We don't know the exact number of customers who left a tip (D) or didn't leave a tip among the lunch rush (z), but we do know the relationship between them and the initial group. Let's substitute w in place of z in the D equation:

D = w + (27 - w) who left a tip from the initial group

Now, let's substitute C - B in place of A in the C equation:

C = (C - B) + 26 (initial number of customers)

Finally, using the same formula we've used for D to calculate the number of customers who didn't leave a tip among the initial group (B), let's call it E:

E = w - (27 - w) who didn't leave a tip among the initial group

Now, we know D, E, and C. Let's calculate B, the number of customers during the lunch rush:

B = C - E

Now, let's calculate the final answer we're looking for in the original question:

x = w + (27 - w) who left a tip from the initial group

Finally, we found all the information we need to calculate the number of customers who left a tip in the initial group (x).

x = D (number of customers who left a tip)

x = w + (27 - w) who left a tip from the initial group

x = w + 27 - w (subtract w from both sides)

x = 27 (number of customers who joined during the lunch rush)

The final answer is:

Among the initial group of customers, all 27 who joined during the lunch rush left a tip.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. How many giant stuffed bears did the toy store have in total before the new shipment arrived?
   - We know there were 17 bears in total before the new shipment arrived.
   - {The final answer is: 17}

2. How many bears did they receive in the new shipment?
   - The text tells us they received another shipment with 10 bears in it.
   - {The final answer is: 10}

3. How many bears are in the store now, after receiving the new shipment?
   - We know there were 17 bears before and then they received 10 more, for a total of 27 bears.
   - {The final answer is: 27}

4. How many bears are on each shelf, and how many shelves did they use to display all of the bears?
   - The text tells us there are 9 bears on each shelf.
   - To find the number of shelves, we can divide the total number of bears (27) by the number of bears on each shelf (9).
   - {The final answer is: 3 shelves (rounded down)}

   - Alternatively, we could find the number of shelves they would need to display all the bears using the divisibility rule of 9. If you divide a number by 9 and the remainder is zero, then it's divisible by 9. If the remainder is not zero, then it's not divisible by 9.

   - To use this rule, let's find the first multiple of 9 that's greater than or equal to 27.

   - 27 is not divisible by 9, so let's find the next multiple.
    - 36 is divisible by 9, and 36 - 27 = 9, so 3 shelves should suffice (again, rounded down).
   - {The final answer is: 3 shelves}

5. How many total bears are they displaying on their shelves (taking into account the new shipment)?
   - To find the number of bears they're displaying, we can multiply the number of shelves (3) by the number of bears on each shelf (9) to get the total number of displayed bears.
   - {The final answer is: 27 displayed bears}

Putting it all together, we can say:

After receiving a new shipment with 10 more bears, the toy store now has 27 bears in total, 3 shelves to display them on (9 bears per shelf), and a total of 27 displayed bears.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. Gwen was organizing her bookcase.
2. She made sure that each shelf had exactly 4 books.
3. She had question marks (?) instead of specific values for some variables.
4. She had 5 shelves of mystery books and 3 shelves of picture books.

To find the total number of books, we need to find the number of books on each shelf, add them up for all the shelves, and then sum up the books from mystery and picture books shelves separately.

Let's assign some values to the unknown variables:

1. Number of books on each shelf: x
2. Number of mystery books shelves: i
3. Number of picture books shelves: j

Now we can calculate the number of books in each category:

1. Number of books on each shelf: i * x books on mystery books shelves
           j * x books on picture books shelves
           Total number of books: (i*x) + (j*x)

Substituting the values provided:

1. Number of books on each mystery shelf: i * x = ?
2. Number of books on each picture books shelf: j * x = ?
3. Total number of books: (i * x) + (j * x) = ?

Using the provided information:

1. Gwen had 5 mystery books shelves: i = 5
2. Gwen had 3 picture books shelves: j = 3
3. Each shelf (both mystery and picture books) had 4 books: x = 4

Now we can replace the question marks with actual numbers:

1. Number of books on each mystery shelf: 5 * 4 = 20 books
2. Number of books on each picture books shelf: 3 * 4 = 12 books
3. Total number of books: (5 * 4) + (3 * 4) = 24 books {The final answer is}.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. We know that Wendy uploaded a total of 79 pictures to Facebook. Let's call the number of pictures in the first album x. Then, the number of pictures in the remaining 5 albums is (79-x).

2. We also know that Wendy put 44 pictures into the first album. This leaves (79-44) = 35 pictures to distribute among the remaining 5 albums. Each of these 5 albums will contain an average of 35/5 = 7 pictures.

3. Therefore, the total number of pictures in all 6 albums is x + 44 + (5 * 7) = (1) x + 89.

4. But we know that the total number of pictures is 79. Comparing (1) with this fact, we can write:

   x + 89 = 79

5. Solving for x, we get:

   x = 79 - 89 = -10

6. However, we can't have a negative number of pictures, so we know that Wendy didn't put any pictures in the first album. Therefore, all 79 pictures are in the other 5 albums.

7. So, each of the remaining 5 albums contains an average of 79/5 = 16 pictures. Therefore, Wendy put 16*5 = 80 pictures into the remaining 5 albums, for a total of 80 pictures from the remaining albums plus the 44 pictures in the first album, which equals 124 pictures, leaving us with 79.

8. Therefore, Wendy actually uploaded a total of 79 + 124 = 203 pictures, meaning that we must have made a mistake in our initial calculations. Let's look more carefully at the problem.

9. Let's assume that Wendy uploaded 44 pictures to the first album. Then, we can calculate the number of pictures left in the remaining albums, which is (79-44). This leaves us with (44 + b) albums, where b is the total number of pictures in the remaining albums.

10. We know that the total number of pictures is still 79. So, we have:

   (44 + b) * avg = 79

11. Here, avg is the average number of pictures per album. Assuming that Wendy distributed the remaining pictures equally, we have:

   avg = (79 - 44) / (44 + b)

12. Solving for b, we get:

   b = 79 * ((44 + b) / avg) - 44

13. By trial and error, we can find numeric values for this expression, which leads us to believe that Wendy actually uploaded around 107 pictures in total. As a final sanity check, we confirm that (107-44)/5 = 16.13, which is pretty close to the integer value of 16. We, therefore, have our answer!

14. {The final answer is that Wendy uploaded approximately 107 pictures to Facebook, with the vast majority of them, 44, being published in a single album.}

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total number of members in the debate team on a given day, which is provided in the question. Since there are ! (5 factorial) boys and 40 girls, the total number of team members is:

   Total number of members = Boys + Girls
   Total number of members = 5! + 40
   Total number of members = 120 + 40
   Total number of members = 160

2. Next, we know that the team was split into groups on that day, and the number of groups is unknown. Let's call the number of groups x. Now, we have 160 members, and each group should have 9 members, so we can find the number of groups as:

   Total number of members = Groups * 9
   X * 9 = 160
   X = 160 / 9
   X ≈ 18.89 groups

   However, since we can't have decimal numbers of groups, it's not possible to have exactly 18.89 groups. So, let's round x up to the nearest integer, which is 19.

3. As we have found the total number of groups and each group should have 9 members, we can now determine the number of boys and girls in each group.

   Assume that x groups are formed. So, the number of members in each group is 9. Based on the given condition, we know that there are 5! boys in total. Since we have divided the boys in x groups, we can find the number of boys in each group as:

   Number of boys in each group = Boys / x
   Number of boys in each group = (5!)/x

   Similarly, we know that there are 40 girls in total. Since we have divided the girls into x groups, the number of girls in each group can be found as:

   Number of girls in each group = Girls / x
   Number of girls in each group = 40 / x

4. Now we have found the number of boys and girls in each group, and since there are 9 members in each group, we can find the final number of boys and girls as:

   Total number of boys in each group = Number of boys in each group * 9
   Total number of boys in each group = (5!)/x * 9

   Similarly, total number of girls in each group = Number of girls in each group * 9
   Total number of girls in each group = 40/x * 9

5. Now, we can find the final answer for the question. The total number of members in the debate team is 160. Each group has 9 members. Let x be the number of groups formed. Therefore, the final answer can be found as:

   There are x groups of 9 members each in the debate team, and the number of boys and girls in each group is determined according to the previous steps. Therefore, the final number of boys and girls in the debate team is:

   Final number of boys = Total number of boys in each group * x
   Final number of girls = Total number of girls in each group * x

   Final number of boys = (5! * 9) / x
   Final number of boys = (40 * 9) / x

6. Putting all the steps together, we can find the final number of boys and girls as:

   Final number of boys = (5! * 9) / x
   Final number of girls = (40 * 9) / x

   We know the total number of members is 160, and each group has 9 members, and we have already found x in the previous step. Let's substitute x in the final equations and calculate the number of boys and girls:

   Final number of boys = (5! * 9) / 19
   Final number of boys ≈ 26.32

   Final number of girls = (40 * 9) / 19
   Final number of girls ≈ 173.68

7. Since we cannot have decimal number of members, we need to round the final number of boys and girls up to the nearest integer. Based on that, we can find the final number of boys and girls as:

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Understand the given information:
   - Sale: 25% off
   - Original price of each rose: $7
   - Discounted price of each rose: $(0.75) * $7 = $5.25
   - Number of roses at the beginning: 9
   - Number of remaining roses: 5
   - Unknown: Total amount earned by April
   
2. Calculate the discounted price of the first bunch of roses (9 roses):
   - Price of 1 rose: $5.25
   - Price of 9 roses: $5.25 * 9 = $47.25

3. Calculate the amount April earns from the sale of the first bunch of roses:
   - Sales tax (10%): $4.73
   - Discount: $(0.25) * $47.25 = $11.82
   - Final selling price: $31.51
   - Easter Sale discount: $(0.25) * $31.51 = $7.91
   - Amount earned by April: $31.51 - $7.91 - $0.47 (sales tax) = $23.03

4. Calculate the discounted price of the second bunch of roses (5 roses):
   - Price of 1 rose: $5.25
   - Price of 5 roses: $5.25 * 5 = $26.25

5. Calculate the amount April earns from the sale of the second bunch of roses:
   - Sales tax (10%): $2.63
   - Discount: $(0.25) * $26.25 = $6.56
   - Final selling price: $21.09
   - Easter Sale discount: $(0.25) * $21.09 = $5.27
   - Amount earned by April: $21.09 - $5.27 - $0.26 (sales tax) = $15.56

6. Add the amount earned from the sale of the first and second bunches:
   - Total amount earned by April: $23.03 + $15.56 = $38.59

<|assistant|>
Step 1: Understand the given information
- There is a trivia team with a total of 11 members
- During a game, 6 members did not show up
- Each member that did show up and participated scored 9 points
- The total number of points scored is being asked for

Step 2: Count the number of people who did show up
- Total number of people = 11
- Number of people who did not show up = 6
- Number of people who did show up = Total number of people - Number of people who did not show up
- Number of people who did show up = 11 - 6
- Number of people who did show up = 5

Step 3: Calculate the points scored by the ones who did show up
- Number of people who did show up = 5
- Each person who did show up scored 9 points
- Total number of points scored by the ones who did show up = Number of people who did show up times the points scored by each person
- Total number of points scored by the ones who did show up = 5 times 9
- Total number of points scored by the ones who did show up = 45

Step 4: Calculate the total number of points scored
- Total number of points scored by the ones who did show up = 45
- Total number of points scored by the ones who did not show up is not given
- The total number of points scored is the sum of the points scored by all the people who participated
- Total number of points scored = Points scored by the ones who did show up + Points scored by the ones who did not show up
- Total number of points scored = 45 + ? (Points scored by the ones who did not show up)

Step 5: Get the final answer
- To calculate the points scored by the ones who did not show up, we first find out the total number of points scored by the entire team (both who showed up and who didn't)
- Then, subtract the points scored by the ones who did show up from this total
- Total number of points scored by the entire team = Total number of points scored by the ones who did show up + Points scored by the ones who did not show up
- Substitute the known term for the points scored by the ones who did show up in this equation
- Total number of points scored by the entire team = 45 + Points scored by the ones who did not show up
- Total number of points scored by the entire team = Points scored by the entire team - Points scored by the ones who did show up
- Add the points scored by the ones who did show up to both sides of this equation to get a new equation
- Total number of points scored by the entire team + Points scored by the ones who did show up = Points scored by the entire team
- Substitute the value we found for the points scored by the ones who did show up in this equation
- Total number of points scored by the entire team + 45 = Points scored by the entire team
- Find the value of the points scored by the entire team
- Total number of points scored by the entire team = Points scored by the entire team
- Solve the equation for ? (Points scored by the entire team)
- Subtract 45 from both sides to isolate ?
- Total number of points scored by the entire team - 45 = Points scored by the entire team - 45
- Simplify the expression on both sides
- 0 = 0
- Equations with a 0 on both sides simplify to ? (false), since there is no real meaning to 0 = 0. Therefore, there is a discrepancy in the given information, which leads to this apparent contradiction. Either some information about the scores of the people who did not show up is missing, or there is a mistake in the given information, and hence, it is not possible to find the total number of points scored by the entire team.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the initial number of Siamese cats and house cats using variables. Let's call the number of Siamese cats S and the number of house cats H.

We are given the following information:

- The pet store had a total of 13 Siamese cats and H house cats.
- The number of Siamese cats sold during the sale was unknown, but we do know that there were 10 cats sold in total.

To solve for the remaining number of cats after the sale, we can create a system of equations using the information provided.

Let x represent the number of Siamese cats sold during the sale. Our system of equations can be written as:

S + x = 13 (Initial number of Siamese cats)
10 (Number of cats sold) = 5 house cats + x (Number of cats sold during the sale)

To solve for S and H, we can set up a system of two equations and two unknowns and use mathematical techniques such as substitution or elimination to find the values of S and H.

Here's how we can do it using substitution:

Step 1: Write out the equations again so that they're easier to refer to:

S + x = 13
10 = 5 H + x

Step 2: Isolate S in the first equation to get an expression for S in terms of x:

S = 13 - x   (Substitute the value of S in the first equation with 13 - x)

Step 3: Substitute this expression for S into the second equation:

10 = 5 H + (13 - x)  

Step 4: Rearrange the equation to isolate H and simplify:

10 - 5(13 - x) = 5H

H = (10 - 65 + 5x) / 25

Step 5: To find out how many cats are left (all types), we add the number of Siamese cats left (S - x) and house cats (H) that were not sold during the sale. 

Number of cats left = (S - x) + H

Substitute the expression for H into the equation above and simplify:

Number of cats left = (S - x) + (10 - 65 + 5x) / 25

Simplify:

Number of cats left = (25S - 25x - 65) / 25

Substitute the expression for S into the equation above and simplify again:

Number of cats left = ((25 * (13 - x)) - 25x - 65) / 25

Simplify:

Number of cats left = 92/25 - 3x/5

Step 6: Simplify by finding the simplest form of the expression:

Number of cats left = 3.68 (rounded to 2 decimal places) - 0.6x

The final answer is: Number of cats left = 3.68 (rounded to 2 decimal places) - 0.6x. 

We can compare the value of x to find the actual numbers of cats left. For example, if x is zero, then the number of cats left is 92/25 - 0. Alternatively, if x is 7, then the number of cats left is 92/25 - 4.2.

In general, we can calculate the number of cats left for any value of x.

To determine the exact number of Siamese cats and house cats that are left, you could either find the number of cats left for a specific value of x or use algebraic techniques to find x and S and H for a specific scenario. By following these steps in order, you'll be able to determine the number of cats left based on the information provided.

<|assistant|>
Let's first identify the missing information. We don't know Victor's occupation or the name of the grocery store. We also don't know the day of the week for Tuesday.

To determine Victor's occupation, let's look at the hints provided. The problem mentions a sacker, which could mean someone who bags groceries. Let's assume that Victor's occupation is a grocery sacker.

Next, we need to identify the name of the grocery store. Since we don't have enough information to determine this, we'll leave it blank for now.

Lastly, we're not given the day of the week for Tuesday. Let's assume that it's either Monday or Wednesday.

Now let's calculate how much money Victor made over the two days.

On Monday, Victor worked for 8 hours and earned $6 per hour. His total earnings for Monday are $48 (8 hours x $6 per hour).

On Tuesday, we don't know whether it's Monday or Wednesday. Let's assume it's Monday, meaning he worked again on Tuesday, making him work 13 hours in total over the two days ($48 from Monday + 7 hours on Tuesday).

However, let's also assume that it's actually Wednesday, meaning he only worked on Tuesday. This would make him work for a total of 10 hours over the two days ($48 from Monday + 6 hours on Tuesday).

Since we're not sure which day Tuesday is, we'll calculate both scenarios to find his earnings over the two days.

If it's Monday, he made $48 on Monday and $42 (7 hours x $6 per hour) on Tuesday, making a total of $90 over the two days.

If it's Wednesday, he made $48 on Monday and $36 (6 hours x $6 per hour) on Tuesday, making a total of $84 over the two days.

To find out which day it is, we'll continue with both scenarios.

Both Tuesday and Wednesday could be Monday or Wednesday, but we don't have enough information to determine which one it is.

To make matters worse, the hints also give us a store, but the name of the store isn't given. Let's say that the store is called X-Mart. Then the full sentence should be ""Victor was a grocery sacker at X-Mart grocery store...""

In either scenario, we end up with two possible answers, so we can't determine Victor's earnings at this time.

The final answers are:

1. If it's Monday, Victor made a total of $90 working as a grocery sacker at X-Mart over the course of two days.

2. If it's Wednesday, Victor made a total of $84 working as a grocery sacker at X-Mart over the course of two days.

We'll need more information to determine which day Tuesday is and which scenario is correct.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. Megan baked 71 cupcakes for the school's bake sale.
2. Megan's brother Todd ate 43 out of those 71 cupcakes.
3. We need to find out how many packages Megan could make if she puts 7 cupcakes in each package.

To calculate the number of cupcakes Todd ate, we do:
Todd ate 43 cupcakes out of a total of 71.
We can set this up as an equation:
71 = 43 + Todd's remaining cupcakes
Subtracting 43 from both sides:
28 = Todd's remaining cupcakes
So, Megan's brother Todd ate 43 out of 71 cupcakes, leaving Megan with 28 cupcakes.

Now, let's find out how many packages Megan could make.
Megan put 7 cupcakes in each package.
First, we find out how many cupcakes Megan has left after Todd ate some:
Megan has 28 cupcakes left, and we know she baked 71 in total.
We can set this up as an equation:
71 = 28 + Megan's remaining cupcakes
Subtracting 28 from both sides:
43 = Megan's remaining cupcakes
So, Megan has 43 cupcakes left after her brother ate his share.

Now we can figure out how many packages Megan can make.
First, we find out how many cupcakes are in each package, which we know is 7.
Next, we find out how many packages contain all 43 of Megan's remaining cupcakes.
We can set this up as an equation:
7 * number_of_packages = 43
Dividing both sides by 7:
number_of_packages = int(43/7)
So, Megan can make roughly 6 packages with the remaining cupcakes.

Putting it all together:
Megan's brother Todd ate 43 out of the 71 cupcakes she baked.
Megan has 43 cupcakes left, so she can make roughly 6 more packages, for a total of roughly 12 packages in all.
{The final answer is: Megan can make roughly 12 packages with the cupcakes left over after her brother ate 43 of them.}</s>",4,4.0,43.0

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of players and their respective lives as follows:

Initially, there were 2 friends playing the video game, and each of them had 6 lives. The total number of lives in the beginning was 12 (2 friends x 6 lives per friend).

Later, when 2 more players joined the game, the total number of players increased to 4. The total number of lives increased accordingly.

Let's call the new players A and B, and let's assume that A had x lives and B had y lives at the time they joined the game.

The total number of lives after the new players joined is:

12 (initial lives) + x (number of lives for player A) + y (number of lives for player B) = Total lives after new players joined

We know that there were 4 players, so we can find the number of lives for each player after the new players joined by dividing the total number of lives by the total number of players:

Lives per player after new players joined = (Total lives after new players joined) / 4

Let's find the value of x and y such that the number of lives per player is equal to the number of lives remaining after all players died once. In the video game, each player has 6 initial lives, but the game is over when all players have lost all their lives (0 lives remaining).

After all players die once, the total number of lives that remained is 0. The number of lives remaining before the new players joined was 12, so the number of remaining lives after new players joined and all players die once is:

0 (the number of lives remaining after dying once) - 12 (the initial number of lives) - x - y = Total remaining lives after dying once and after new players joined

Now, we are ready to find the value of x and y. By substituting all values obtained so far in the equation that represents the remaining number of lives after dying once, which is equal to the expression we previously calculated that represents the total remaining lives:

Total remaining lives after dying once and after new players joined = (Total lives after new players joined) - (Number of remaining lives when all players die once)

0 = (12 + x + y) - ([4 x 6 lives per player when initially playing] + x + y - [4 x 6] - x - y)

0 = [4 x (6 lives per player when initially playing - 6 lives remaining when all players die once)] - x

0 = (24 lives remaining when all players die once) - x

We get:

x = 24 lives remaining when all players die once

Therefore, the number of lives remaining when all players die once is the same as the number of lives for player A (x) when he joined the game.

Similarly, we can find the number of lives for player B (y) by repeating similar process:

0 = (Total lives after new players joined) - (Number of remaining lives when all players die once)

0 = (12 + x + y) - ([4 x 6 lives per player when initially playing] + x + y - [4 x 6] - x - y)

0 = [4 x (6 lives per player when initially playing - 6 lives remaining when all players die once)] - x - y

0 = [24 (lives remaining when all players die once)] - (x + y)

Therefore, the number of lives for player B (y) when he joined the game is:

y = 24 (lives remaining when all players die once) - x

So, now we have expressions for x and y:

x = 24 (lives remaining when all players die once)
y = 24 (lives remaining when all players die once) - x

x = y (since there’s no difference between them)

y = x (because both A and B has the same number of remaining lives when all players die once)

Finally, we can calculate the value of x:

x = y (the number of lives for A and B)
x = x (it seems like a circular calculation because the left-side variable is the same as the right-side variable)

Since this is a circular calculation, we can't determine the exact number of lives for A or B because it's ambiguous to satisfy this relationship.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps. Let's represent the number of old socks and new socks Sam has by x and y, respectively.

Given information:
- Sam had 10 socks in total.
- He threw away some old socks. Let's say he threw away a = x - y number of socks.
- He had some old socks left, which were y socks.
- He bought 36 new socks.

From this, we can make a system of equations representing the number of old and new socks Sam now has.

x - a = y                 (1)
x + 36 = 10              (2)

We want to find how many socks Sam has in total after buying new socks. For this, we add the number of new socks to the number of old socks Sam now has.

y + 36 = Final number of socks                      (3)

Now, we need to eliminate x from Equations (1) and (2) to find a relationship between a and y.

a = x - y                      (1)
x = a + y                      (4)

Substitute Equation (4) into Equation (2) to find y:

a + y + 36 = 10             (5)

Substitute Equation (1) into (5):

x - y + y + 36 = 10            (6)

Simplify Equation (6) to get:

x - a + 36 = 10             (7)

Finally, substitute Equations (3) and (7) into Equation (1):

y = x - a                           (8)
y + 36 = Final number of socks                          (9)

Equations (8) and (9) form a system with two unknowns, x and y. To find their values, we need an additional equation. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to find a relationship between x and a or y and a. Therefore, we can't find the exact value of the number of socks Sam has in total after buying new socks.

However, the final answer could be found by treating a as a parameter and solving for x and y separately. This would give us a range of possible answers for the number of socks Sam has in total.

3. Before the wedding, 47 flowers (or 47/100, which is 47%) wilted, leaving a total of 103 - 47 = 56 flowers that were still usable.

4. To find how many bouquets Wendy could still make, we need to use the number of remaining flowers and the number of flowers required per bouquet.

5. For the total of 10 bouquets, Wendy initially used 8 flowers per bouquet, for a total of 80 flowers.

6. After some wiltage, Wendy cannot make the full 10 bouquets with the remaining 56 flowers, since she now only has enough for 7 bouquets with each bouquet containing 8 flowers.

7. Let x be the number of bouquets Wendy can still make. Since each bouquet requires 8 flowers, we have 8x flowers remaining.

8. We know that the number of flowers used before wiltage, 80, is equal to the number of flowers used after wiltage, 8x, plus the number of wilted flowers, 47.

9. Solving the equation 80 = 8x + 47, we find that x is approximately 2.67 bouquets, with some flowers left over. Since we cannot make a fractional bouquet, Wendy could make 7 bouquets (rounded down) still.

10. Therefore, the final answer is: Wendy could make 7 bouquets still with the remaining flowers.

The steps involved in solving the problem:
1. Identify the main components of the question, such as the number of flowers Wendy picked, the number of bouquets she initially planned to make, and the number of flowers that wilted.
2. Solve simpler problems, such as calculating the number of flowers initially used and the number of flowers remaining after some wiltage.
3. Use what you've learned to solve the main question by creating a system of equations and solving for the unknown variable.
4. Check that the answer makes sense given the information in the question, and round down where necessary.

By following these steps and being deliberate in your reasoning, you'll be able to tackle more complex math problems in the future!</s>",7,7.0,4.0

                     Adam had 48 books. ! If ? he sold , 19 of them , and : used ; the ; money ? he earned to . buy , 38 new ; books, how many ! books : would Adam have? ; 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initially, Adam had 48 books. (Note: Let's call this the ""initial number"" of books, denoted by I.)

2. Adam sold 19 of his books, leaving him with 29 books left (total number of books minus the number of books sold). (Note: Let's call this the ""remaining number"" of books, denoted by R.)

R = I - 19
R = 48 - 19
R = 29

3. Adam earned some money from selling the 19 books. Let's call this amount of money earned by selling, denoted by S.

4. Adam spent some of this money to buy 38 new books. Let's call this the ""amount spent"" on the new books, denoted by X.

5. After buying these new books, Adam still had some money left over. Let's call this the ""final amount of money"" Adam had, denoted by F.

F = S - X

6. Adam now had a total of 67 books (the original 29 he had left from selling and the new 38 he bought).

7. Let's call this the ""final number"" of books, denoted by N.

N = R + number of new books
N = 29 + 38
N = 67

8. We want to find out how many books Adam would have currently (after buying the new ones) if he still had this final amount of money, which is denoted by M.

Let's represent Adam's current books and final amount of money with formulas:

C = initial number of books + number of new books - (number of new books sold - initial number of books bought)
C = I + new_books - (new_books_sold - bought_books)

M = final amount of money - (price per book for new books × number of new books)
M = F - (price_per_new_book × number_of_new_books)

9. Substituting the formulas from steps 1, 2, and 3 into step 8's formula for C:

C = I + new_books - (new_books_sold - bought_books)
C = 48 + 38 - (38 - bought_books)
C = 86 - bought_books

10. Let's call the number of new books sold the ""number of new books sold,"" denoted by T.

11. Let's call the number of new books bought by Adam the ""number of new books bought,"" denoted by B.

12. Using step 9, substitute T and B from steps 2 and 5:

C = 48 + 38 - (38 - B)
C = R + B - T

13. Using step 2, substitute R from step 1:

C = I - 19 + B - T

14. Using step 4, substitute X from step 5:

C = I - 19 + B - (X/price_per_new_book)

15. Using step 1, substitute I into step 14:

C = 48 - 19 + B - (X/price_per_new_book)

16. We want to find out Adam's current books at step 15. However, we still don't have the price per new book. So, let's call it the ""price per new book,"" denoted by P.

17. Using steps 15 and 16, let's substitute B, X, and P into step 14:

C = 48 - 19 + (B/P) - (X/price_per_new_book)

18. Using steps 14, 15, and 16, substitute B, X, P, and I into step 13:

C = R - T + (B/P) - (X/price_per_new_book)

19. Using steps 1 and 18, we have Adam's current books (denoted by C) in terms of R, T, B, X, and P:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the known quantities and variables:
   - Number of students: 12
   - Number of adults: 3
   - Capacity of each van: ! 5 ! people
   - Number of people in the class: 12 + 3 = 15

2. Calculate the number of people in each van if all 15 people can fit in one van:
   - Number of people per van: 15 people / 1 van = ! 5 ! people per van

3. Calculate the number of vans needed if all 15 people fit in one van:
   - Number of vans needed: 15 people / ! 5 ! people per van = 1 van

4. Since we're not making that assumption, let's calculate the number of people in each van assuming there are some empty seats:
   - If x is the number of vans needed, then the number of people in each van with no empty seats is x * ! 5 ! people per van. However, since some seats will be empty, let's say each van has y empty seats on average, so the number of empty seats is y * x vans. The number of people in each van is still x * ! 5 ! people per van, but y fewer than that due to the empty seats. Thus, (x * ! 5 !) - y is the number of people in each van.

   - Number of empty seats per van: y vans
   - Number of people in each van: (x * ! 5 !) - y

   - Number of people in total: Number of students + Number of adults + Number of empty seats

5. Find the value of y:
   - Number of students: ! 5 ! * (x * ! 5 !) - y
   - Number of students: 12
   - Substitute the value of 'x' from 4 in the above expression:

     x * ! 5 ! (1 - y/! 5 !) = 12

   - Solving the quadratic expression for 'y':

     y^2 + (-12*! 5 !) y + (12)*(! 5 !)^2 = 0

   - Calculating the value of 'y':

     y = (-12*! 5 !) +/- square root[( -12*! 5 !)^2 - 4 * ( ! 5 !)^3]

     y = -10.8 or -0.2 (rounded off to two decimal places)

6. Calculate the number of empty seats on average:
   - Number of empty seats on average: y

7. Calculate the number of vans needed:
   - Number of vans needed: (12 students + 3 adults) / (average number of people in each van)

   - Number of vans needed = 15 / ((x * ! 5 !) - y)

   - Solving the quadratic expression for 'x':

     x^2 * !(5 - y)^2 - 3*y*x*(5-y) + 5*y*(5-y) = 0

   - Calculating the value of 'x':

     x = (-((3*y*(5-y)) + (5*y*(5-y))^2^0.5) + (5*y*(5-y))^2^0.5) / ((!(5-y)^2))

8. Put it all together:

   - Number of vans needed: Rounded off to the nearest integer

   - {The final answer is}.

This problem involves finding the number of vans required to carry 12 students and 3 adults to the zoo, assuming that each van can hold between 1 and 6 people (rounded to the nearest whole number). We are given that the capacity of each van is between 5 and 1 people (again, rounded to the nearest whole number). As we don't know the exact number of people that each van can carry, we don't know the exact number of vans required to accommodate everyone. However, using algebra, we can work through a series of equations to find the correct number of vans.

For simplicity, we'll assume for step 3 that everyone fits into one van",3,3.0,3.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, let's find the total number of regular sodas Tom bought. This is four sodas per each soda can, so we have 4 × number of regular sodas. Let's call this quantity x.
   x = 4 × number of regular sodas

2. Next, we have the total number of diet sodas. This is 52 sodas per diet pack, and Tom bought five diet packs, so we have 5 × 10 = 50 sodas per diet pack. Therefore, the total number of diet sodas is 50 × number of diet packs. Let's call this quantity y.
   y = 50 × number of diet packs

3. Now, let's find the total number of sodas Tom bought, which is the sum of the number of regular sodas and the number of diet sodas.
   x + y = Total number of sodas

4. We now have two equations with two unknowns. Let's write the equations:
   x = 4 × number of regular sodas
   y = 50 × number of diet packs

5. To eliminate one of the unknowns, we can substitute one equation into the other. Let's substitute the expression for x from the first equation into the second equation.
   When we do this, we arrive at an equation purely in terms of the number of diet packs:
   y = 50 × (number of regular sodas / 4)

6. Now that we have an equation purely in terms of the number of diet packs, we can solve for the number of diet packs. However, we notice that the right-hand side is a fraction. Let's rewrite this fraction using the product rule for division:
   y = (50 × number of regular sodas) / 4

7. Next, we can use the distributive property to isolate the number of regular sodas in this expression. Let's multiply 50 and the term inside the parentheses and simplify.
   y = (number of regular sodas) / 4

8. Now, let's find the number of shelves required to store all the sodas. First, we need to find the maximum number of sodas that can fit onto one shelf. We know that the fridge can hold 0.7 liters per can, and a can of soda is 355 ml. Therefore, we have 0.7 liters per 355 ml, which equals 0.2 ml per ml. The total volume of sodas on a single shelf is:
   Volume of shelf = Number of regular sodas per shelf × 355 ml per can × 0.2 liters per ml

9. Now, we want to find the number of shelves required to store all the sodas. We can do this by using the number of regular sodas and dividing by the total volume of the sodas on each shelf.
   Number of shelves = (Total number of regular sodas) / (Volume of shelf)

10. Let's substitute the expression for the number of regular sodas that we found in Step 7 into this equation.
   Number of shelves = (y) / (Volume of shelf)

11. When we substitute the expressions for x and y that we found in Step 3, we get:
   Number of shelves = ((50 × number of diet packs) / 4) / (Volume of shelf)

12. To find the number of shelves required, we substitute the expression for the volume of each shelf that we found in Step 8 into the equation from Step 11:
   Number of shelves = ((50 × number of diet packs) / 4) / (Number of regular sodas per shelf × 355 ml per can × 0.2 liters per ml)

13. We can simplify this expression by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the inverse of the expression inside the parentheses:
   Number of shelves = (50 × number of diet packs × number of regular sodas per shelf × 355 ml per can × 0.2 liters per ml) / (4 × 0.2 liters per ml)

14. Lastly, we can simplify this expression by multiplying and dividing by 1:

Let's represent the number of students in the cafeteria as x.

At the beginning, there are 38 apples in the cafeteria.

(1) The school used 20 apples to make lunch for an unknown number of students.

Let's call this number y.

So, we have 38 - 20 = x apples left after making lunch for y students.

(2) The school then gave each of the 38 students one apple.

20 apples were used for lunch and 38 apples were given to students, so the total number of apples used so far is 20 + 38 = 58.

We are left with x - 38 apples afterwards.

(3) The school bought 28 more apples.

Now, the total number of apples is 58 + 28 = 86.

(4) The school has a total of x remaining students.

So, the total number of apples is divided equally among the students.

86 apples are divided among x students.

Each student receives (86 apples) / (x students) apples.

Let's let z be the number of apples each student receives.

Now, we have our system of equations:

58 = 20 + 38 (students eating lunch still have their apples)

z = (86 apples) / (x students)

y = z*x

We can use substitution to eliminate some unknowns:

z*x = y

z*(x-38) = y-38*z

We can find y using substitution:

y = z*x

y = 20*x/x-38*z

Now, we can eliminate x using substitution:

y = 20*(x-38)/(1-z*(38/x))

Using algebraic manipulation, we can find an expression for x in terms of y and z.

x = (y*(1-z*(38/y))) / (20*(1-z)*(1-z*(38/y)))

Now that we know how many apples are in the cafeteria, we can calculate the number of apples left after distributing them to the students (the remainder).

Number of apples remaining = 38 + (x - y) + (y - z*x) = 38 + x - y - z*x

Using substitution:

Number of apples remaining = 38 + x - y - z*(y*(1-z*(38/y))) / (20*(1-z)*(1-z*(38/y)))

Finally:

The final answer is... [whatever you get ;)]

The number of apples remaining in the cafeteria is: [number here].

Let's break this down and solve each part of the problem separately.

1. How many trays does Luke pick up from one table? (1 table)

   We know that Luke picked up 20 trays from one table. Therefore,
   
   Number of trays picked up from one table = 20 trays

2. How many trays does Luke pick up from another table? (2 tables)

   We know that Luke picked up 16 trays from another table. Therefore,
   
   Number of trays picked up from another table = 16 trays

3. How many trips does Luke make to pick up trays from both tables?

   To figure this out, we need to calculate how many trays Luke is picking up in total.

   Total number of trays = Number of trays picked up from one table + Number of trays picked up from another table

   Let's find the total number of trays.

   Total number of trays = 20 trays + 16 trays

   Total number of trays = 36 trays

   Now, let's find out how many times Luke needs to make trips to pick up all the trays.

   Total number of trips = Total number of trays / Number of trays Luke can carry per trip

   Let's find the total number of trips.

   Total number of trips = 36 trays / 4 trays per trip

   Total number of trips = 9 trips

   {The final answer is: Luke needs to make a total of 9 trips to pick up all the trays from both tables.}

   - He needs a total of 8 action figures for a complete collection.
   - Each action figure costs $6.

2. Find the number of action figures Henry needs to buy to complete his collection:
   - Number of action figures needed in total: 8
   - Number of action figures he already has: 3
   - Difference: 8 - 3 = 5
   - So, Henry needs to buy 5 more action figures to complete his collection.

3. Calculate the total cost of the action figures Henry needs to buy:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to determine how many dollars Frank had saved in total. We are given the information that he had saved $3 up $x$ dollars. This can be represented with the equation $3 + x = $total savings$.

2. Next, we know that Frank received $0.37 per week for his allowance. This amount is equivalent to $37 cents, so we can convert it to $0.37 per week or $14.10 per month ($14.10 = 0.37 * 36 weeks in a year, divided by 12 weeks in a month).

3. We also know how much Frank receives for an 8-dollar toy. This information is not explicitly stated, but we can assume that he receives the toy for free, which means that each toy costs him $0.

4. So, we can calculate the number of toys Frank can buy with his saved and allowance money. Let's say Frank saves $x$ and receives $14.10 per month (total allowance money per month: $14.10).

5. Each toy costs $8, and we know that Frank saves a certain $x$ each month for toys. This means that each month, Frank has a total of $x + 14.10 available for toys.

6. To find out how many toys Frank can buy with this money, we can divide the total amount available for toys by the cost of each toy. The formula for this calculation is:

   number of toys = ($x+14.10) / 8

7. Now that we have the formula for finding out how many toys Frank can buy, we can replace $x$ and $14.10$ with their specific values to get Frank's exact number of toys:

   number of toys = ($3 + x$) / 8 + 1 / 8

8. Notice that I split the total available toys into two parts: the $14.10$ worth of toys Frank receives from his allowance and the $x$ worth of toys he saves. Frank receives 1 toy every month ($14.10 / 8$), and he saves $x$/8 toys every month.

9. Putting it all together, we have the equation for Frank's total number of toys:

10. Finally, we can simplify this expression to get the total number of toys Frank can afford:

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many good carrots they picked in total. We know that Vanessa picked 17 good carrots and her mother picked 14 good carrots. Let's add them up:

   Vanessa: 17 good carrots
   Mother: 14 good carrots
   Total: 31 good carrots

2. Next, we know that there were a total of 24 good carrots. We can use this information, along with the number of good carrots we found in step 1, to determine how many bad carrots they picked:

   Total good carrots: 31
   Total good and bad carrots: 24
   Bad carrots (subtracting the good carrots from the total): 24 - 31 = -7

   This means there were actually fewer bad carrots than they could have picked. So we know that there must not be any bad carrots.

3. Therefore, all of the carrots they picked were good, and we know there were a total of 31 good carrots.

   Question: How many bad carrots did they have?

   Answer: They had no bad carrots, so there is 0 bad carrots in total.

   Final answer indicated: The final answer is 0 bad carrots.

<|assistant|>
Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 23 managers and 7 employees for a total of 30 people at the picnic.

2. All 30 people will participate in the game of volleyball, which will be split into 6 teams.

3. To find the number of people on each team, we can use the concept of parts to a whole. For every 6 teams, there will be a total of 30 people. We can set this up as an equation:

   6 x n = 30

    where n is the number of people on each team. 

4. Solving for n:

   n = 30 ÷ 6

   n = 5

    So, there will be 5 people on each team.

5. In total, we will have 30 people at the picnic, and all 30 will be playing volleyball. Given that there are 23 managers, we can find out how many managers are playing volleyball. Let's call this x. We can see this relationship as:

   23 managers = x managers playing volleyball

6. The same can be said for the employees, but with a smaller quantity:

   7 employees = y employees playing volleyball

7. Since there are 30 people playing volleyball overall, let's find how many of them are managers:

   x managers + y employees = 30 people playing volleyball

8. Let's substitute the expressions of x and y in relation to the original managers and employees:

   23 managers = x managers playing volleyball

   7 employees = y employees playing volleyball

   x managers + 7 employees = 30 people playing volleyball

9. Since all employees are playing volleyball, we know for certain that:

   y employees = 7 employees

10. Putting all this together, we can simplify the above expression:

   23 managers = x managers playing volleyball

   7 employees = 7 employees

   x managers + 7 employees = 30 people playing volleyball

   We can see that we only have one expression with a variable (x). By setting expressions with different variables as equal, we can determine the value of the variable that has no other associated value (x).

11. Given that we know the number of managers and employees playing volleyball, and we have found how many people are playing volleyball overall (30), we can find a relationship with all these numbers:

   23 managers playing volleyball + 7 employees playing volleyball = 30 people playing volleyball

12. To find how many total managers and employees are present at the picnic but not playing volleyball, we must subtract the number of managers and employees playing volleyball from the total quantity.

   23 managers - (23 managers playing volleyball) = total managers not playing volleyball

   7 employees - (7 employees playing volleyball) = total employees not playing volleyball

13. Now, let's find how many people in total are not playing volleyball at the picnic:

   total managers not playing volleyball + total employees not playing volleyball = total non-playing people

14. By setting up an equation using all the expressions found so far, we can find the final answer:

   total managers not playing volleyball + 23 managers playing volleyball + total employees not playing volleyball + 7 employees playing volleyball = total people at the picnic (30 people)

   Our final equation is:

   total managers not playing volleyball + 23 managers playing volleyball + total employees not playing volleyball + 7 employees playing volleyball = 30 people

15. Solving this equation:

   total managers not playing volleyball = 30 people - (23 managers playing volleyball + 7 employees playing volleyball)

   The final answer is:

   total non-playing people = total managers not playing volleyball + total employees not playing volleyball

   Let's say we found out that there were 15 managers who were not participating in the volleyball match; thus, the total employees who were not playing would be:

First, let's find out how many cups of flour Tiffany used for the 8 brownies she baked. Since she used 1 cup of flour for each brownie, she used a total of 8 cups for all 8 brownies.

| Quantity | Brownies | Flour (cups) per brownie | Total Flour (cups) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Baked | 8 | 1 | 8 |

Next, we need to find the total amount of flour that Tiffany needs for the 17 brownies required for the party. Since she needs 1 cup of flour for each brownie, she needs a total of 17 cups of flour for the party.

Now, we know that Tiffany used 8 cups of flour for the 8 brownies she already baked, and she needs a total of 17 cups of flour for the party. To find out how much flour she still needs, we subtract the amount she used for the brownies she already baked from the total amount she needs for the party.

Let's call the number of carrots Carol picked x and the number her mother picked y.

We can set up systems of equations to represent the information we have:

1) Number of carrots picked by Carol and her mother:

x + y = 38

2) Number of good carrots picked by Carol and her mother:

0.7x + 0.7y = ? (Let's call this question mark g)

3) Number of bad carrots picked by Carol and her mother:

0.3x + 0.3y = b (Let's call this question mark b)

We know x and y are non-negative integers, so let's restrict our solutions to those regions.

First, let's solve the system of equations with x and y as unknowns:

x + y = 38

0.7x + 0.7y = g

0.3x + 0.3y = b

Now, let's find g and b.

From the first equation, we know that the total number of carrots picked is 38. From the second equation, we know that the total number of good carrots picked is 0.7(x + y) = 0.7g. It follows that g = (0.7)^-1(38) = 54.

Now, let's find b. From the first equation, we have that the total number of carrots picked is 38. From the third equation, we know that the total number of bad carrots picked is 0.3(x + y) = 0.3b. It follows that b = (0.3)^-1((0.7)^-1(38)) = 22.

Now, we know g and b. Let's find x and y.

From the second equation, we have that the number of good carrots picked by Carol and her mother is 54. Of these, Carol picked 0.7x of them. This means that her mother picked 0.7(54 - x) of them. Let's set x to be the number Carol picked:

x = 54(0.7) + 0.7(54 - x) = 54

Solving for y:

y = (38 - x) = (38 - 54) = -16

However, y cannot be negative since x and y are non-negative integers. Therefore, the statement is contradictory and the initial system of equations may not have a solution in integers.

The final answer is that either the statement ""Carol picked 38 carrots and her mother picked 38 carrots"" is not true or the statement ""The carrots were 0.7 good"" is not true. Either of these statements is necessary to make the system of equations have a unique and possible solution.</s>",7,7.0,0.7

Using the information provided, we can reason as follows:

1. Find the number of problems left to grade for Teacher A:
   - When Teacher A started grading, she had 7 worksheets with a total of 7 x 7 = 49 problems.
   - We know that Teacher A has already graded 0 problems for Teacher X, so the number of problems Teacher A has already graded for herself is 0.
   - The total number of problems Teacher A has graded is the sum of the problems she has graded for herself and Teacher X.
   - Therefore, 
      0 + 0 = X
       X = 0
       So, X = 0.
2. Now find the number of problems left to grade for Teacher X:
   - When Teacher X started grading, she had 17 worksheets with a total of 17 x 7 = 119 problems.
   - We know that Teacher X had already graded 8 problems for Teacher A.
   - The total number of problems Teacher X has graded is the sum of the problems she has graded for Teacher A and herself.
   - Therefore,
      - The number of problems left to grade for Teacher X is the difference between the total number of problems left and the number of problems already graded for her and Teacher A.
      - That is,

Let's break this down step by step:

1. We are asked to find the total number of lives that the friends had while playing the video game online after two more players joined.

2. We are given that there were 8! (or 8 factorial) friends playing the game and each friend had 6 lives.

3. When two more players joined, the total number of players increased to 8 + 2 = 10. Let's call the new players P1 and P2.

4. The number of lives for all the players remains the same, so each friend still has 6 lives. This means that P1 and P2 also have 6 lives each, for a total of 12 lives for the new players.

5. Adding the lives of the new players to the lives of the original players, we get the total number of lives:

    Total lives = 8! (lives per friend) + 12 (lives of new players)

6. Simplifying this expression using the factorial formula, we get:

    Total lives = 8 * 7 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 + 2 * 6

7. Calculating this value, we find that there are a total of 720 lives among the group of 10 players.

Let's denote the number of tickets Cody won at the arcade as x.

At the arcade, Cody won x tickets, and each ticket cost 1 cent. We can find the total amount Cody spent at the arcade:

x tickets, each worth 1 cent: $x

Cody spent 25 cents on a beanie. Let's denote the number of beanie tickets as y.

Cody bought y beanie tickets for 25 cents each. In total, the beanie tickets cost:

y beanie tickets, each worth 25 cents: $y/4

Later, Cody won 6 more tickets. Let's denote this as z.

Cody's total number of tickets now is x + z. We can find the total amount he spent on these tickets:

(x + z) tickets, each worth 1 cent: $(x + z)

Summarizing all the spends, the total amount Cody spent is:

x tickets: $x
y beanie tickets: $y/4
(x + z) additional tickets: $(x + z)

We can now group the expenses related to the beanie:

x tickets: $x
(y/4) beanie tickets: $y/4

We know that the total amount Cody spent was $25. Substituting the expressions for the ticket costs and beanie costs, we get:

$25 = x + y/4 + (x + z)

Solving for x:

$x = 25 - y/4 - (x + z)

$4x = 25 - y/4

$x = (25 - y/4) / 4

We can define g = 25 - y/4. Because y is not explicitly given in the problem, let's replace the expression for y in terms of g:

y = 4g - 100

Substituting this expression for y in terms of g into the expression for x, we get:

$x = (25 - (4g - 100)/4) / 4

Simplifying:

$x = (100 - g) / 2

Substituting g with 100 - y:

$x = (100 - (4y - 100)) / 2

Simplifying:

$x = (200 - 4y) / 2

Let's define d = 200 - 4x. Using the result obtained for x, we get:

x = 100 - d / 4

Finally, substituting d into the definition for g, we have:

g = 100 - d

y = 4(100 - d) - 100

y = 400 - 50d

Now all the variables in terms of d, representing Cody's final number of tickets won, we can write:

x = 100 - d / 4
y = 400 - 50d
z = d - x

The total number of tickets Cody has is the sum of x, y, and z:

Final number of tickets:

x + y + z = 100 - d / 4 + 400 - 50d + d - (100 - d / 4)

Simplifying:

Final number of tickets:

400 - 100d / 4

{The final answer is} 400 - 100d / 4.

To find out how many tickets Cody would have if he did not win any beanie tickets but later won 6 more tickets, let d = 0 and calculate:

Final number of tickets:

400 - 100(0) / 4 = 500 tickets

To find out how many tickets Cody would have if he did win any beanie tickets but did not win any additional tickets, let z = 0 and calculate:

Final number of tickets:

x + y = 100 - (100 - y) / 4 + y

3. Let's call the number of piles Bianca can make x.

4. Each pile has 8 pieces of candy. Therefore, x piles contain a total of 8x pieces of candy, which is equal to the number of pieces left.

5. 8x = 78

6. Dividing both sides by 8 gives us:

   x = 9.75 (cannot be a whole number)

   Since we cannot make exactly 9.75 piles, Bianca cannot make exactly x piles.

   However, if we round up 9.75 to the nearest whole number, it becomes 10. Therefore, Bianca can make 10 piles, each containing 8 pieces of candy.

7. There will be 8 candies left over, as we cannot divide this remainder into whole piles.

Let's call the original 5 friends x. Each friend had 8 lives, so the total number of lives at the beginning was 8x.

When 2 more players joined, the total number of players increased by 2. Before the new players arrived, each remaining player had the same number of lives, so the total number of lives remained the same. Thus, the number of lives after the new players arrived was still 8x.

But after the new players joined, each new player also had 8 lives. So the total number of lives increases by 16 (2 new players times 8 lives per player). Therefore, the total number of lives at the end was 8x + 16.

To find the total number of players at the end, we add the original 5 players (x) and the 2 new players (2) to get 7 players in total.

Now we want to find how many lives each player had at the end. Since each player (excluding the new players) still had the same number of lives (8) at the end, the total number of lives per player at the end (using the given information) was:

(8x + 16) / 7 players

We can simplify this using algebra:

(8x + 16) / 7 = lives per player

To solve for x (in terms of lives per player), we need to isolate x in this equation:

(8x + 16) / 7 = lives per player

8x / 7 = lives per player - 16 / 7

To isolate x, we need to get x on its own on one side of the equation and all the other variables on the other side. To do this, we'll subtract 16x/7 from both sides:

8x / 7 = (lives per player - 16/7)

Then divide both sides by 8:

x = (lives per player - 16/7) / 8

Finally, remember to show your initial steps for clarity and to indicate that this is the final answer.

Initial steps:
Let's call the original 5 friends x. Each friend had 8 lives, for a total of 8x lives. When 2 more players joined, each new player had 8 lives, as well, for a total of 16 new lives.

The total number of lives remained the same, so 8x lives before the new players joined is still 8x lives after they arrived. However, when we add the lives of the new players, we get a new total of 8x lives plus 16 new lives, or 8x + 16 lives.

The total number of players is now 7, since the new players brought our total to 7. To find the average number of lives per player, we divide the total number of lives by the total number of players. We want to know how many lives each player had, both original and new, at the end.

(8x + 16) / 7 = average number of lives per player

Final answer:
The formula for finding the number of lives for each player, given the number of lives per player and the total number of lives, is lives per player times the number of players plus remaining lives. Using our formula derived above, we replace lives per player with our equation for lives per player in terms of x:

(8x + 16) / 7 = average number of lives per player

We then replace lives per player with our equation for lives per player in terms of x:

(8x + 16) / 7 = (x - 16/7) / 8

We can manipulate this equation to solve for x by dividing both sides by a common factor of 8:

x = (lives per player - 16/7) / 8</s>",56,56.0,8.0

First, we need to find the number of adult meals. The total number of people is 11, and there are 2 kids. So, the number of adult meals is:

11 - 2 (number of adults) = 9

Next, we calculate the cost of the adult meals. Each adult meal costs $8. So, we have:

9 (number of adult meals) * $8 (cost per meal) = $72 (total cost of adult meals)

Now, we need to find the number of free kids' meals. Each kid gets a free meal. So, we have:

2 (number of kids) * 1 (number of free meals per kid) = 2 (number of free kids' meals)

Finally, we add the cost of the adult meals and the free kids' meals to get the total cost:

$72 (cost of adult meals) + $0 (cost of free kids' meals) = $72 (total cost)

Putting it all together:

The final answer is $72.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we'll need to keep track of Wendy's remaining lives after each event. Let's represent the number of lives Wendy has at a given point as L(n), where n represents the current event (numbered starting from 1).

Event 1: Wendy starts the game with 10 lives (L(1) = 10).

Event 2: Wendy encounters a difficult part of the game and loses 6 lives (L(2) = L(1) - 6).

Event 3: Wendy earns 37 more lives (L(3) = L(2) + 37).

Event 4: Wendy enters the next level (n). In this level, she has L(n) - 6 lost lives from Event 2, plus the 37 gained in Event 3. She also gains an additional number of lives, which we'll call x, for a total of L(n) = L(n-1) - 6 + x.

Let's set up the equation for Event 4:

L(n) = L(n-1) - 6 + x

Substitute L(3) for L(n-1):

L(n) = L(3) - 6 + x

L(n) = 10 - 6 + x (from Event 3)

Simplifying:

L(n) = 4 + x

We're interested in finding the value for x, so let's solve the equation for x:

L(n) = x + 4 (substituting L(n) = x + 4)

L(n) - 4 = x (solving for x)

Now, we know that L(n) represents the total number of lives Wendy has at the end of level n. We're given that Wendy has 37 more lives in this level (n), so we can substitute that into our equation:

L(n) - 4 = x

L(n) = 37 + 4

Simplifying:

L(n) = 41

Now, we can find the value for x:

x = L(n) - 4

Substituting L(n) = 41:

x = 41 - 4

Simplifying:

x = 37

So, Wendy earns an additional 37 lives when she enters level n, giving her a total of L(n) = 37 + 41 = 78 lives at the end of level n.

Putting everything together, we can represent each step of our reasoning:

Step 1: Wendy starts the game with 10 lives.

L(1) = 10

Step 2: Wendy loses 6 lives in a difficult part of the game.

L(2) = L(1) - 6

Step 3: Wendy gains 37 more lives.

L(3) = L(2) + 37

Step 4: Wendy enters level n and has 6 lost lives from Step 2, plus the 37 gained in Step 3. She also earns an additional number of lives, which we'll call x, for a total of L(n).

L(n) = L(3) - 6 + x

To find x, we solve the equation for it:

L(n) = x + 4

L(n) - 4 = x

Then, we can find the number of lives Wendy has at the end of level n by substituting L(n) into our original equation from Step 4:

L(n) = 37 + 41

Simplifying:

L(n) = 78

Therefore, Wendy's final number of lives after level n is 78.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount earned by Frank during the summer:

   Let x be the number of dollars Frank earned in total. Then, we know he made 19 dollars per mow. Since the problem does not specify how many lawns he mowed, we assume he mowed an unknown number of lawns.

   x = (unknown number of lawns) * 19 dollars/lawn

   We can also find the total number of lawns mowed by dividing x by 19 dollars/lawn.

   (unknown number of lawns) = x / 19 dollars/lawn

2. Calculate the cost of new mower blades:

   Let y be the number of dollars Frank spent on new mower blades. Then, y is equal to 11 dollars.

   y = 11 dollars

3. Find the amount left after buying new mower blades:

   Let l be the number of dollars Frank had left after buying new mower blades. We can calculate this by subtracting the cost of the new mower blades (y) from the total amount earned (x).

   l = x - y

4. Determine the number of 2-dollar games Frank can buy:

   Let g be the number of 2-dollar games Frank can buy with the money left after buying new mower blades. Then:

   g = l / 2 dollars/game

5. Putting it all together:

   We have all the pieces we need to answer the question. Here's our final answer:

   The final answer is: Frank can buy g two-dollar games with the money left after buying new mower blades, where g is given by:

   g = (x - 11 dollars) / 2 dollars/game

   Note: here '!' is used as a mathematical symbol called factorial ('!' represents the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the argument). However, in this case, the '!' is incorrectly used to represent a multiplication sign instead. The problem should have been expressed correctly as:

   In this corrected statement, the use of '!' is for rhetoric only. The formulae to calculate the total amount earned, amount spent on new mower blades, the amount left after buying the new mower blades, and the number of 2-dollar games he can buy with the left money remain the same.

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of players on the baseball team. We are given that the team had 48 new players and 6 returning players. Adding these together, we get a total of 54 players (48 new players + 6 returning players = 54 players).

Next, we need to figure out how many groups the coach can put the players into. The coach wants to put them into ! groups, where ! is a symbol representing a factorial (in this case, it means 6 groups). Each group will have 6 players.

To find the number of groups, we can set up an equation for the number of players in the groups (6 players per group) and the number of groups (x groups):

6 * x = 54

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9

So, the coach can put the players into 9 groups with 6 players in each group.

Finally, we confirm our answer by checking that our solution makes sense. After putting the players into 9 groups, each group will have 6 players, and the total number of players in all groups will be 54 (9 groups with 6 players in each group = 54 players).

1. Nancy had a total of 80 files on her computer. (given)
2. Nancy deleted 31 files. (given)
3. After deleting these files, Nancy was left with 49 files (Remaining files = Total files - Deleted files = 80 - 31 = 49).
4. Nancy then created folders for these remaining files and put each group of seven files into a separate folder. (given)
5. In total, she created n folders for these files. (unknown)

Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:

1. First, let's break down the complex English sentence into simpler parts:
   - Luke was selling his old games.
   - At first, he had 39 games.
   - He sold 19 games.
   - The remaining games were packed into boxes.
   - There were four games in each box.
2. Now let's find out how many games Luke had left after selling 19:
   - Luke started with 39 games.
   - He sold 19 games.
   - So, the number of games Luke had left is 39 - 19, which is 20.
3. To find out how many boxes Luke needed, we need to calculate how many games were left and how many games went into each box:
   - Luke had 20 games left after selling 19.
   - Each box can hold 4 games.
   - Let's call the number of boxes x.
   - Then, we know that the number of games left, 20, is equal to 4 times the number of boxes, x.
   - We can write this as an equation: 20 = 4x
4. By following the steps above, we can simplify the problem into a math equation that we can easily solve:
   20 = 4x
5. To find the value of x, we can isolate it by dividing both sides by 4:
   - 20 ÷ 4 = x ÷ 4
   - 5 = x
6. Therefore, Luke needed five boxes to pack up the remaining games.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps and work through each one systematically.

1. First, we'll determine how many students would be on the ! team. We're given that 17 students didn't make the ! team, so we know that the remaining 48 students (65 - 17) will either be on the ! team or the? team. Since we're told that some students are put into ?8! groups, we can represent this using combinations:

   ! team: The number of ways to select the ! team from 48 students is given by the combinations formula:

   !team = 48 C 17 = 48! / (17! (48 - 17)!) = 624

2. Now, we'll find out how many students will not be on the ? or ! team. We know that the total number of students is 65, so the number of students not on either team is:

   Rest = 65 - (17 + 624) = 48

3. To calculate how many groups we have, we're given that ! groups have 8 students each. We're also told that there are ?8! groups total. To find the number of groups, we can use the combinations formula again:

   Groups = ? * 8! / (?-8)! = ?

   We can't immediately solve for ?, as we don't know how many groups have ? students each.

4. Next, we'll determine how many students are in each group. We know that there are 8 students in each group, but we don't know how many students from each team are in each group. Let's use x and y to represent, respectively, the number of students from the ? team and the number of students from the ! team in each group.

5. Looking at the total number of students on each team, we know that:

   ? team: 48 - 17 = 31 students

   ! team: 624 students

   Rest: 0 students

6. We can then find the number of ways to distribute x students from the ? team and y students from the ! team into the groups:

   Distribution = 8! / (x)! (8 - x)! (y)! (8 - y)!

7. Finally, we're ready to solve for ?. If we set the number of students from the ? team in each group to x, then we know that the number of students from the ! team in each group is y = 8 - x. By substituting this into the expression for the total number of students on each team (step 4), we get:

   31 = x

   0 = 8 - x

   From this we know that the value of x is 31, and the number of students from the ! team is y = 8 - 31 = 0.

   Substituting these values into the expression for the total number of students in each group (step 5), we get:

   8 = 31

   This is a contradiction, so we've made a mistake somewhere. 

   To summarize, we're unable to find the value of ? that satisfies both the constraints given in the problem, and there is no obvious solution. The statement ""8 ! groups"" is more than enough to put all 65 students into their respective positions, so we can assume that ? is some large number of groups.

The final answer is unknown due to a contradiction in the problem statement.


Hope this analysis helps! If you have any questions or need any help understanding this or future problems, please feel free to let me know. Good luck! 

The statement ""8 ! groups"" is more than enough to put all 65 students into their respective positions, so we can assume that ""?"" is some large number of groups.

But if the problem is trying to determine the actual number of ? teams and ? groups, then we need to find out how many students are in ? teams (which we know is 31) and how many students are in each ? group (which based on the above, we know is also 31). Then we can divide the total number of students in ? groups by the number of students in each ? group to find the number of ? groups. However, this",6,6.0,31.0

Let's first simplify the notation to make it more readable. We'll replace the excessive exclamation points with regular text:

Isabeluploaded25pictures to Facebook. She put 10pictures into one album and put the rest into 5 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?

Let's represent the number of pictures in one album as x. The number of pictures in the other 5 albums will be represented by y.

Since all 25 pictures have been distributed among the 6 albums, we can write:

x + 5y = 25

Solving this equation will give us the number of pictures in one album and the number of pictures in each of the other 5 albums.

Here are the steps to solve the equation:

1. Isolate x: Subtract 5y from both sides to get rid of y.

x - 5y = 25 - 5y

2. Distribute -5 to both y terms inside the parentheses.

-5xy = 250 - 25y

3. Group like terms.

x(-5y) = (-25y) + 100

Or,

x(-5) = -25y + 100

4. To get rid of the y variable, divide both sides by -5y.

x/(-5y) = (100 + 25y)/(-5y)

5. Simplify division by factoring out the common y term.

x/(-5) = (-20) + (10)/y

6. Solve for x, being careful to keep the -5 factor.

x = (-20) * y + 10

Now, let's find y.

Since Isabel originally had 25 pictures and distributed them among the 6 albums, we know that x and 5y add up to 25. Let's represent this relationship using a system of equations:

x + 5y = 25

Let's create a new variable A to represent the total number of pictures in the first album (x). Then, we can write y in terms of A:

y = (25 - x)/5

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

x + 5(25 - x)/5 = 25

Simplifying:

x - x(25 - x)/5 = 25

We can now combine like terms to simplify:

x(1 - 25/5) = 25

Multiplying through:

x = 25 * 5/(5 - 25)

x = 250/(10)

x = 25

The same way we solved for x, let's solve for A (the total number of pictures in the first album).

A = x

A = 25

Now we know that in the first album, there are 25 pictures.

But we still need to find out how many pictures are in each of the other 5 albums.

Using our formula for y (in terms of A):

y = (25 - 25)/5 = 0

There are no pictures in the other 5 albums.

That doesn't make sense in this context, as Isabel uploaded 25 pictures, and we have now discovered that all 25 pictures are in the first album.

This problem has either an error or an unintended assumption. Without further context about Isabel's actions, it's impossible to say which.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's identify the total amount of money Mike made in two ways and the amounts he spent on mowing lawns, weeding, and other expenses apart from mowing and weeding.

Mike made $30 and $14 for a total of $44 mowing lawns.
Mike made $26 for weeding; this amount is not related to the number of weeks, so we can assume this is a one-time payment.
Mike's other expenses (excluding mowing and weeding) cost him $5 a week.

Let's calculate how long his money would last based on his weekly expenses.

Mike's weekly expenses (excluding mowing and weeding) are $5. His weekly income from mowing is $30, so on the weeks he does not weed, his total income for the week is $35.

When he does weed, his weekly income is $56 ($30 from mowing and $26 from weeding). In this case, his total weekly income is $61 (the extra $5 comes from weekly expenses).

Let's draw up a table to calculate how long his money would last based on his income and expenses.

| Weeks         | Income           | Expenses           | 
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 - weed       | $56              | $61               | -$5                 |
| 2 - weed       | $56              | $61               | -$5                 |
| 3 - weed       | $56              | $61               | -$5                 |
| 4 - weed       | $56              | $61               | -$5                 |
| ...           | ...              | ...               | ...                 |

In this table, weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 correspond to situations where Mike weeds in a given week. For these weeks, we compare his income to his expenses, adding up all expenses in each case. Week 5, for instance, assumes Mike does not weed in that week.

Based on this, we can see that no matter how many weeks Mike does weed, his expenses will always eventually exceed his income. This means no matter how many weeks he weeds, his money will run out.

Therefore, the problem of how long his money would last when he only spends $5 a week cannot be solved in this context, as his money would run out regardless of how many weeks he does weed after week 4.

The final answer is that Mike's money would not last infinitely long when he only spends $5 a week, as his expenses for both weeding and non-weeding weeks will eventually exceed his income.

The solution assumes that no other sources of income are present that could replenish his finances. In the real world, people can adjust their spending habits or find alternative sources of income as circumstances change, causing possible variations of this scenario.</s>",8,8.0,5.0

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of music and video files on Vanessa's flash drive before deleting some files as x and y, respectively. After deleting 30 files in total (x30 music files and y30 video files), the number of remaining music and video files on her flash drive is (x-30) and (y-30), respectively.

Before deleting files: 

Music files: x = 16
Video files: y = 48

After deleting files:

Music files: (x-30) = 16-30
Video files: (y-30) = 48-30

We can rewrite this system of linear equations as follows:

x - 30 = 16 - 30   (1)
y - 30 = 48 - 30   (2)

Let's solve this system using the method of substitution. First, we use equation (1) to find the value of x:

x - 30 = 16 - 30
x = 16 + 30
x = 46

Now, substitute x into equation (2) to find the value of y:

y - 30 = 48 - 30
y = 18

The number of music files remaining on Vanessa's flash drive is 46, and the number of video files remaining is 18.

Final answer: After deleting 30 music files and 30 video files, Vanessa had 46 music files and 18 video files left on her flash drive. {The final answer is: 46 music files and 18 video files.}</s>",34,34.0,18.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to identify the variables and their values. We'll use D for Dave, S for short sleeve shirts, and L for long sleeve shirts. Before school started, Dave had to wash 9 S and 27 L shirts in total, so we have:

Dave had 9 short sleeve shirts (S) and 27 long sleeve shirts (L) to wash before school.

2. We also know that when school started, Dave had already washed 20 of the shirts. We don't know whether they were short sleeve or long sleeve, so let's just call them M. We can represent this using a formula:

Dave had washed M short sleeve shirts and 20 long sleeve shirts before school (M + 20 = 20).

3. Now we need to find out how many short sleeve shirts Dave didn't wash before school. Let's call this N. We know that N is the difference between the total number of short sleeve shirts he had to wash before school and the number of short sleeve shirts he had washed before school. We can represent this using another formula:

Dave had N short sleeve shirts left to wash before school (9 - M = N).

4. At this point, we have two equations relating to the number of short sleeve shirts Dave had washed (but we don't yet know M). To find M, we can set the formulas equal to each other and solve for M:

M + 20 = 20 (we only know that Dave had washed 20 long sleeve shirts before school)

9 - M = N (we have already found an expression for N)

We can then manipulate these two equations to isolate M and find its value. Here's how to do it:

First, let's find a way to remove M from the first equation. To do this, we can subtract 20 from both sides:

9 - N = M

Then, let's use the value of N from the second equation to replace N in this equation:

9 - (9 - 20) = M (when we subtract 9 from both sides of the second equation, we get 20 - N = 20, and N = 20)

Simplify:

0 = M

So, M equals zero. This means that Dave didn't wash any short sleeve shirts before school, and the only short sleeve shirts he had to wash were the ones he washed after school (or during school, we don't know). To calculate the total number of short sleeve shirts Dave had to wash, add the number he washed after school (which we don't know) to the number he washed before school (which we know was zero):

Number of short sleeve shirts Dave had to wash = 0 (short sleeve shirts he washed before school) + M (short sleeve shirts he washed after school)

Replacement:

Number of short sleeve shirts Dave had to wash = 0 + M

Simplification:

Number of short sleeve shirts Dave had to wash = M

So we can remove M from our equation and simplify:

Number of short sleeve shirts Dave had to wash = 0 (which is zero)

However, we know that there are 9 short sleeve shirts in total, so we can simplify:

Number of short sleeve shirts Dave already had when he started washing = 9

Number of short sleeve shirts Dave had to wash = -9

Since negative numbers can't represent the number of shirts Dave had to wash, it's not possible to have -9 short sleeve shirts, so we must have made an error somewhere, and our original assumption that Dave had already washed some of the short sleeve shirts before school is wrong. This means that all the 9 S shirts he had to wash were the ones he washed after school.

We can now solve the problem using these updated assumptions:

Dave had 9 short sleeve shirts (S) and 27 long sleeve shirts (L) to wash before school.

After school started, Dave had already washed 0 short sleeve shirts and 20 long sleeve shirts.

We don't know how many short sleeve shirts Dave washed after school - let's call that number X.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first need to identify the unknown variables and the given information. Here, we have the chef's initial number of potatoes left to cook, an unknown number, as well as the amount of time it takes to cook each potato and a known number of potatoes already cooked.

Let x represent the number of potatoes the chef has left to cook. We know that the chef originally had 9 potatoes to cook and has already cooked 7 of them. This gives us the relationship 9 = already cooked potatoes + x. Substituting the known information, we get 

9 = 7 + x

To find out how long it will take the chef to cook the remaining x potatoes, we first need to know how long it takes to cook each potato. Let y be the number of minutes it takes to cook each potato. Using the given information, we can set up the equation:

7 * y = already cooked potatoes * y (the already cooked potatoes took y minutes each to cook)

Let's substitute the already cooked potatoes number we found earlier, and simplify the equation:

7 * y = (9 - x) * y (the already cooked potatoes number is 9-x)

7 * y = 9y - xy

Next, we want to find out how many minutes it will take to cook the remaining x potatoes. Let z be the time it takes to cook the remaining potatoes. Since the chef will be cooking all x potatoes at once, the total time will be z minutes.

Now we can relate this to the time it takes to cook each potato. Given the time it takes to cook each potato y, we know that after y minutes, one potato is done. So, for the x remaining potatoes, it will take them a total of xy minutes to cook. Thus, the total cooking time z is the sum of the xy cooking time of the remaining potatoes and the previously cooked potatoes' cooking time, which we've already calculated to be 7y.

z = 7y + xy

Let's substitute y and xy values from our earlier computation and simplify the equation:

z = 7y + (9y - xy)y

z = 9y - 2xy

We can now find the remaining number of potatoes x by substituting all the known values and solving for the variable:

9 = 7 + x

Substituting for 7, we have:

9 = already cooked potatoes + x

x = 9 - already cooked potatoes (from this expression, we can find the value of x)

Now, to find y, the number of minutes it takes to cook each potato, we can substitute the value of y from our earlier calculation in the first equation:

7 * y = (9 - x) * y

From this, we solve for y:

y = (9 - x) / 7

Now we have all the values required to find the time it will take to cook the remaining potatoes. We substitute the values of x and y in the final equation we derived:

z = 9y - 2xy

Note that y is already calculated, so it's all set here.

After some simplification, we get:

z = 54 - 12x

So, finally, we can obtain our answer. The time it will take to cook the remaining x potatoes is:

The final answer is: z minutes.</s>",6,6.0,12.0

<|assistant|>
First, let's define some variables. Let x be the number of pictures Gwen took at the zoo and let y be the number of pictures she took at the museum. After vacation, Gwen deleted 15 pictures, so let p be the number of pictures she originally had on her camera.

We know that x + y = p, since this represents the total number of pictures Gwen took on her vacation. After deleting 15 pictures, Gwen is left with the remaining number of pictures, which we will call q.

Equation: q = p - 15

Now, let's look at the statement ""she later deleted."" This means that there were more pictures to delete after the initial 15. Let's call the number of additional pictures d. Then, Gwen ended up with a final number of pictures b.

Equation: b = q - d (the number of pictures after deleting d)

Putting everything together:

x + y = p (total number of pictures taken)
x = p - y (equating x to the difference between p and y)
x = p - (p - b) = b - y (substituting in the relationship between x, p, and b)

Plugging this expression for x into the equation for b:

b = q - d = (p - 15 - y) - d

To find out how many pictures Gwen still has after deleting a total of d, simply compare the expression for b (above) and the expression for q (the number of pictures remaining after deleting the initial 15).

b - q = -y - d (the difference between the number of pictures she has now (b) and the number of pictures remaining after deleting d is the difference between the number of pictures taken at the zoo (x) and the number of pictures taken at the zoo minus the number of pictures taken at the museum in total)

{The final answer is} Gwen still has b - q = -y - d pictures from her vacation. This reveals an interesting detail - Gwen has fewer pictures now than she did at the end of her vacation! This makes sense since she's deleted more pictures than she had remaining after the initial deletion (15).

The expression for b can also be simplified to b = p - d - y, which shows Gwen's total number of remaining pictures. This expression reveals that Gwen's total number of remaining pictures after deleting a total of d pictures is equal to the total number of pictures she took at the beginning of the vacation, minus the number of additional pictures she deleted after returning home (d), and the number of pictures she took at the museum (y).

Here's a summary of all the equations:

x + y = p (total number of pictures taken)
x = p - y (equating x to the difference between p and y)
x = b - y (equating x to the difference between b and y)
b = p - 15 - y (the remaining pictures after deleting the initial 15)
b = q - d (the remaining pictures after deleting d more pictures)
b = p - d - y (the final number of remaining pictures)

BONUS: The number of pictures Gwen still has after returning home is equal to the number of pictures she took at the zoo minus the number of pictures she took at the museum, minus the number of pictures she deleted at home (after returning home).

b = x - y - d

{The final answer is} Gwen still has b = x - y - d pictures from her vacation. This reduces to b = -d, since x and y have already been solved for, and d is the unknown. This formula shows that, for Gwen, the number of remaining pictures is equal to the difference between the number of pictures taken at the zoo and the number of pictures taken at the museum, minus the number of additional pictures Gwen deleted after returning.

The more pictures Gwen deletes after returning home, the fewer pictures she will have remaining in the end.

In conclusion, after deleting both the initial 15 and d more pictures, Gwen still has b remaining photographs from her vacation, where b = p - d - y, as we've defined it. Gwen's remaining pictures are equal to the total number she took at the beginning of her vacation, minus the number of additional pictures she deleted at home after returning, as well as the number of pictures",55,55.0,15.0

<|assistant|>
Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. Initially, there were 2 puppies in the shelter. We'll represent this as x = 2. This is our starting point.

2. An additional 34 puppies were brought in via another route (perhaps rescue, donation, etc.). This new number of puppies is represented as y = 34.

3. By using algebraic notation, the current number of puppies can be found by adding the initial number of puppies (x) and the number of puppies brought in (y). We can represent this as:

   x + y = current number of puppies

4. To find the number of days it would take for all the puppies (including the ones just brought in) to be adopted, we need to use the information provided about the daily adoption rate (4 puppies a day).

5. The formula for finding the total number of puppies adopted when x number of puppies are adopted each day and n number of days has passed can be represented algebraically as:

   x * n = total number of puppies adopted in n days

6. Now, we need to consider how long it would take for all the puppies in the shelter to be adopted. This is represented by the variable n. We can set up an equation by using the formula for daily adoption rate (x) and the total number of puppies (current number of puppies).

   x * n = (x + y)

7. Let's solve this equation for n.

   x * n = (x + y)

8. Dividing both sides by x:

   n = (x + y) / x

   n = (2 + 34) / 4 (since we're calculating the number of days it takes for the adopted puppies to exceed the current number of puppies in the shelter)

9. The final answer will look something like this: For all the puppies in the shelter to be adopted, it would take n days, according to the formula {n = (x + y) / x}, where x and y are the initial number of puppies and the number of puppies brought in, respectively.

10. After substituting in the values we know, we can fill in the blanks to get the solution:

   For all the puppies in the shelter to be adopted, it would take {n = (2 + 34) / 4} days.

   Or, in simpler terms, it would take approximately 34 days for all the puppies to be adopted assuming a daily adoption rate of 4 puppies.</s>",9,9.0,4.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pieces of clothing Will have left after washing the first load.

   Let x be the number of pieces of clothing in each small load. Then, in the first load, Will washed 32 of the original 59 pieces. This leaves x * 9 + 32 pieces remaining:

   x * 9 + 32 = 59 - 32
    x * 9 = 27
    x = 3

2. Find out how many pieces of clothing each small load will contain.

   For ease of calculation, let's assume that the equal number of pieces of clothing in each small load is 3. If this is not the case, we can replace 3 with the value of x in the solution above.

3. Calculate how many pieces of clothing each of the smaller loads will contain.

   Now that we know that there are 3 pieces of clothing in each original load, and 3 pieces of clothing in each small load, we can calculate the total number of pieces of clothing in each smaller load using the following equation:

   3 * (number of small loads) = number of pieces of clothing in each smaller load

4. Find out how many small loads Will have to distribute the remaining pieces of clothing.

   There are 59 - (3 * 32) = 35 remaining pieces of clothing that Will needs to distribute among the nine smaller loads. We can find out how many smaller loads Will need through the following equation:

   (number of smaller loads) * 3 = 35
   number of smaller loads = 35 / 3 = 11

5. Calculate how many pieces of clothing each smaller load will contain.

   Now that we know how many smaller loads Will need, we can calculate the number of pieces of clothing in each smaller load using the following equation:

   number of pieces of clothing in each smaller load = number of small loads / (9 + 1) = 3

6. Calculate the total number of pieces of clothing that Will needs to wash.

   There will be 3 pieces of clothing in each original load, and 3 pieces per smaller load. We can calculate the total number of pieces of clothing using the following equation:

   (number of original loads) * 3 + (number of smaller loads) * 3 = total number of pieces of clothing
   32 * 3 + 3 * 11 = 132 pieces

7. Conclusion

   In summary, Will has a total of 132 pieces of clothing that he needs to wash. For the first load, he washed 32 pieces, leaving 100 pieces remaining. He decided to split the remaining pieces into smaller, equal loads. After nine such loads, he still had 35 remaining pieces that he distributed among the additional 11 smaller loads, each containing 3 pieces of clothing.</s>",3,3.0,3.0

Let's denote the type of candy in the second system as ""x.""

First system:
- Adam bought 2 boxes of chocolate candy.
- Let x be the number of boxes of candy-flavored (or ""other"") candy Adam bought.
- Adam bought a total of x boxes of other candy.
- Each box contains 4 pieces of candy.

Second system:
- Adam bought 5 boxes of caramel candy.
- Let y be the number of boxes of chocolate candy Adam bought.
- There is a relationship between the number of chocolate and other candy boxes: y : x = 2 : 5.
- Compute the total number of pieces of chocolate and other candy: 4y + 4x = (total number of pieces of candy).
- Compute the total number of boxes: y + x = (total number of boxes).

From the first system, we know that x and 2 boxes of chocolate candy form a ratio of 2 : 5. Let's solve for x.
- 2x = 5
- x = 5/2
- Let's round both values down because Adam cannot buy a fraction of a box.
   - x becomes 2 boxes

From the second system, we have 2 equations and 3 unknowns: y, x, and the total number of pieces. To find y and x, we need one more equation. Since we now know the values of x and the number of boxes in the second system, we can set up a third equation.
- From the first system, we know there are a total of 4y pieces of chocolate candy.
   - We can say that this is ""y*4 = 4y"" because ""4"" is the number of pieces per box and ""y"" is the number of boxes.

From the second system, we have ""4x"" pieces of other candy and ""4y"" pieces of chocolate candy, for a total of ""4y + 4x"" pieces of candy.

Finally, we set up our three equations and solve for y and x:

- Equation 1: y + x = (total number of boxes)
- Equation 2: 4y + 4x = (total number of pieces)
- Equation 3: 2x = 5

We can solve for y and x in terms of the total number of boxes and pieces using simultaneous equations.

- y = (total number of pieces - 4x) / 4
- We can use equation 3 to replace x in equation 2, and then solve for y.
- y = ((total number of pieces) - (4 * 2)) / 4
- y = ((total number of pieces) - 8) / 4
- Let's round y down to the nearest integer, as Adam cannot buy a fraction of a box.
   - y becomes the nearest integer less than ""((total number of pieces) - 8) / 4""

- x = (total number of boxes - y) / 2

   - x becomes the nearest integer less than ""((total number of boxes) - (nearest integer less than ""((total number of pieces) - 8) / 4"")) / 2"".

The total number of pieces is ""4y + 4x,"" which is equal to the total number of pieces obtained from the second system. The total number of boxes is ""y + x."" This completes the solution for Adam's chocolate and candy purchase.

{The final answer is:
Assuming Adam cannot buy a fraction of a box, we found that the relationship between the number of boxes of chocolate and other candy is 2 : 5. Adam bought a total of 2 boxes of chocolate candy and 2 boxes of other candy (both of which are rounded down to the nearest integer). Using these values, we found how many boxes of chocolate and other candy Adam bought based on our solution. Finally, we computed the total number of pieces of candy and boxes purchased by Adam.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.

                     April's : discount flowers was having a sale where : each ? flower . was 6 ! dollars. : If ? Katie bought : 5 ? roses and ; 5 . daisies, ? how much ; did she spend? ! 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
1. Identify the variables:
   - x represents the type of flower that April is discounting
   - y represents the number of flowers that Katie bought
   - p represents the price of each x flower before the discount
   - d represents the discount percentage (expressed as a decimal)
   - s represents the total amount that Katie spent
   - r represents the number of roses that Katie bought
   - daisies represents the number of daisies that Katie bought
2. Understand the discount equation:
   - p (1 - d) represents the price of each x flower after the discount
3. Calculate the price of each rose:
   - Let's assume that the discount does not apply to the roses
   - Therefore, each rose costs $6
4. Calculate the price of each daisy:
   - Each daisy costs $x - $6, because katie is able to buy daisies for $x after the discount, but we know that a rose costs $6 before the discount
   - Note: If we assume that the discount does apply to daisies, we would need to replace $6 with the price of daisies before the discount
5. Calculate the total price of all the roses:
   - Since katie bought r roses, the total price of the roses is $r * $6 = $36
6. Calculate the total price of all the daisies:
   - Since katie bought d daisies, the total price of the daisies is $d * (x - $6) = $dx - $6d$
7. Combine the price of the roses and the price of the daisies:
   - Let us call the total price of all the flowers as T
   - T = $36 + $dx - $6d$
8. Use the given information to simplify T:
   - Since katie bought r roses and d daisies, the total number of flowers she bought is (r + d) flowers
   - Each flower costs $x after the discount
   - Therefore, the total price she paid for all the flowers is (r + d) * x = T
9. Use the given information to construct an equation for T:
   - Let's call (r + d) as y
   - T = y * x
10. Combine everything:
   - We know that T = S and can construct an equation using our simplified T:
   - S = y * x
11. Insert the variables in the scenario given for katie:
   - If y represents the total number of flowers, then r roses and d daisies are y in this case, and r is 5
   - If y represents the total number of flowers, then p represents the price of each x flower before the discount, and daisies are not included in the discount, so p is $6 for roses
   - Since the discount is for x flowers, then d is the discount percentage for those flowers, but since katie is not discounting the daisies, we will assume p for the price of each daisy is $3 (or you can assume that p for the price of each daisy is $x - $6, as was demonstrated earlier), and d is always 0 for the daisies
   - If d is 0 for the daisies, then the entire scenario can be represented with a single d variable for discount across all flowers or d = 0 (or you can assume daisies as not discounted at all)
12. Insert everything into the simplified T:
   - Since katie bought 5 roses and 5 daisies, y = (r + d). (Note: In this case, r and d are specific figures, but y is a generic term for the total number of flowers). Also, since p for the roses is $6 and p for the daisies is $3 (or you can assume p for daisies is $x - $6), we can write this as:
   - S = (5 + 0) * x
   - Simplify S :
   - S = 5x
13. Check to make sure we arrived at the right answer:
   - The final answer is S = $5x

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the given information using algebraic variables. Let x be the number of adventure books and y be the number of mystery books that Victor bought at the school's book fair.

We are given that Victor bought a total of 32 adventure books, which can be expressed as:

x = 32

Also, we know that Victor bought a total of 37 mystery books. We don't yet know how many of these were used, but let's call the number of used mystery books z. We can set up an equation for the total number of mystery books bought and the number of used mystery books:

y = 37 - z

Now, we know that 16 of the mystery books were used. Let's call these used mystery books w. We can express this using our variables:

w = 16

And since all unused mystery books are also new books (as per the prompt), we can say:

(y - w) = x

This is because the number of new mystery books is equal to the number of remaining mystery books, which is y - w. The number of new adventure books is also zero as he did not buy any new adventure books.

Combining these equations, we get:

32 = x
37 = 37 - z
y = 37 - z
x = y

After substituting x and y in terms of z, we can express the system of equations as:

32 = 37 - z
37 = 37 - z

We can see that the equation is the same for both x and y. Therefore, if we solve for z, we can find the number of used mystery books, which will allow us to calculate the number of new mystery books bought using (y - w). 

Here's how we proceed with solving this system of equations:

32 = 37 - z     (1)
37 = 37 - z     (2)

Subtracting equation (2) from (1), we can express z in terms of the different variables:

32 - 37 = -5 - z

Simplifying this further, we get:

-5 = -z

Since our equation is meant to determine the value of z, we can divide both sides by -1:

5 = z

Now that we have found the value of z, we can calculate the number of new mystery books bought as:

(y - w) = x

But since x and y both have the same value which is 32, we can simplify this as:

32 = 32 - z

Simplifying this, we get:

32 = 32 - 16     (as we know that 16 of the mystery books were used)

16 = -z      (as we have already calculated that z is 5)

Since we cannot have a negative number of books, we know that this part of the problem doesn't make sense, as it is not possible to have used more books than we have in total. The question may be confusing, and in real life, we would not expect this scenario to arise.

Hence, we can say that Victor could not have used more mystery books than he bought in the given setup. This means that the expression 16 of the mystery books were never used in the problem. We can remove this part from our setup as it appears to have caused confusion.

So, our updated question becomes:

 ;  ; At the school's book fair , Victor bought 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books. If 0 (zero) of the mystery books were used, how many new mystery books did he buy?.

Now, let's solve the simplified problem using our revised setup:

32 = x
37 = y

Subtracting equation (2) from (1), we can find the value of z:

32 = 37 - z    (1)
37 = y      (2)

Let's say we didn't need the value of z to solve for y, but we can still subtract equation (2) from (1) to check z = 0.

32 = 37 - z    (1)
37 = y      (2)

Subtracting (2) from (1):

32 - 37 = -z",53,53.0,37.0

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of carrots initially in Maria's garden as x.

After picking 48 carrots, we have x - 48 carrots left. Then she throws out 11 of those, leaving (x - 48) - 11 carrots in her garden. Then she picks 15 more carrots, which brings her to a new total of (x - 48) - 11 + 15 = x - 32 carrots.

Let's call this new total w. So we have w = x - 32.

Now suppose we want to find out how many carrots Maria has after picking an additional 15 carrots the next day. Let's call this new total z. We can write an equation to represent this: z = w + 15. Substituting in our value for w, we get z = x - 32 + 15.

There's a shorter way to write this, called combining like terms. To combine like terms, you add or subtract terms that are the same type (in this case, having an ""x""). So instead of writing (x - 32) + 15, we write x - 17, because 32 and -15 (the opposite of 15) both have an ""x"" in them.

So our final equation is z = x - 17. We can now figure out how many carrots Maria has in total. To find out how many she's picked so far, we add up all the carrots she's picked: 48 at the beginning, and then the new number of carrots left after her second picking: w. And we've already figured out that w = x - 32. So the total number of carrots Maria has picked is 48 + (x - 32) = x - 4.

Now we just need to add that to the number of carrots left in her garden, which is z. Our complete equation is z = x - 17, and the number we want is z. So if we want to figure out how many carrots Maria has in total, we can use substitution to replace all the x's now that we know what they are in terms of the other variables.

This means we can replace every x in our equation with (48 + w). So our equation becomes z = (48 + w) - 17. We can then use substitution again to replace w with x - 32, since w = x - 32.

So our final equation is z = (48 + (x - 32)) - 17, and we're done!

To summarize, our solution is:

After picking 48 : carrots from her garden, throwing out 11 : of them, and then picking 15 : more, Maria had a total of x - 17 : carrots left in her garden. The total number of carrots Maria picked is 48 + (x - 32) = x - 4 : carrots. Then, after picking an additional 15 : carrots the next day, she had a total of z = (48 + (x - 32)) - 17 : carrots left in her garden.

Let's define some variables to represent the original number of roses, the number of roses sold in the first transaction, and the number of roses picked after the second transaction:

x = original number of roses
y = number of roses sold in first transaction
z = number of roses picked after second transaction

We know that the original number of roses was $50$. After the first transaction, the number of roses remaining is:

x - y = number of remaining roses

Substituting the original number of roses and the number of roses sold, we can find the number of remaining roses:

50 - y = number of remaining roses

After picking some more roses, the new number of roses is:

number of remaining roses - z = final number of roses

Substituting the expressions for the number of remaining roses, we can find the final number of roses:

50 - y - z = final number of roses

Using the information provided in the question, we can set up a system of equations:

y = 15 ! (number of roses sold in first transaction)
z = 21 (number of roses picked after second transaction)

Substituting the expression for the number of remaining roses from the first equation, we can find the second equation:

50 - y = x - y - z (number of remaining roses after second transaction)

We have two variables (x and y) and two equations. To solve this system, we can use a method such as substitution or matrices. 

We will solve this system using substitution:

First, let's find y and substitute it into the second equation to solve for x:

y = 15 ! (number of roses sold in first transaction)
50 - y = x - y - z (number of remaining roses after second transaction)

Substituting for y, we get:

15 ! = y
50 - 15 ! = x - 15 ! - z

This equation represents the two unknowns (x and z) in terms of the known values of y (the number of roses sold in the first transaction) and the given value of z (the number of roses picked after the second transaction).

Next, we'll use the value of y (which we've already found) to help us find z. This will allow us to find x:

y = 15 !
z = 21 - x + 15 ! (number of roses picked after second transaction)

Substituting the expression for y, we get:

15 ! = y
z = 21 - x + 15 ! (number of roses picked after second transaction)

We can now set up a system of two equations and two unknowns:

x - 15 ! - z = 50 - 15 ! (number of remaining roses after second transaction)
z = 21 - x + 15 ! (number of roses picked after second transaction)

Now, we can solve this system using the method of substitution:

First, let's eliminate x by substituting the expression for x from the second equation into the first equation:

x - 15 ! - (21 - x + 15 !) = 50 - 15 !

Simplifying this expression for x, we get:

-15 ! = z - 50

Substituting this expression for z into the equation we found earlier for z, we can find z:

z = 21 - x + 15 ! (number of roses picked after second transaction)

Substituting the expression for z that we found, we can find x:

-15 ! = z - 50
21 - x + 15 ! = z - 50
-15 ! + 50 = 21 - x + 15 ! + 50

Here's where it gets a little tricky. We have a quadratic equation with a variable that we want to find, x. We will use the quadratic formula to find x.

Let's set up the quadratic equation:

-15 ! - 50 = 21 - x + 15 ! (number of remaining roses after second transaction",56,56.0,15.0

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of problems that Isabel has to complete across both math and reading homework.

First, let's deal with the math homework. Isabel has 2 pages of math homework, and each page has 5 problems. So, the total number of problems she has in math homework is:

2 pages x 5 problems per page = 10 math problems.

Next, we must handle the reading homework. Isabel has 4 pages of reading homework, and we don't know how many problems are on each page. Let's say it's x. So, the total number of reading problems Isabel has to complete is:

4 pages x x problems per page = x reading problems.

Now, let's put it all together. In total, Isabel has 10 math problems and x reading problems. So, the total number of problems she has to complete is:

Let's represent the number of players before the new players joined as x. So, there were 4 x's playing the video game online. When 5 more players joined, the total number of players became (x + 5).

The statement ""there were 4: friends playing a: video: game: online"" can be read as ""there were 4 groups of friends playing a video game online"". So each group of friends had 3 lives, and each person in the group had 3 lives. Since there were x number of groups of friends playing, this means that each player initially had 3 x lives.

Let's find the total number of lives before and after the new players joined.

Before the new players joined, the total number of lives was 3 x 4 friends = 12 x's.

After the new players joined, each player had 3 lives, so the total number of lives is 3 (x + 5) players = 3x5 + 15.

Now, we want to find the equation for how many lives each player has.

Before the new players joined, each player had 3 x's. After the new players joined, the number of lives needed to be recalculated, as some of the players previously playing remained and others were replaced. Let's find this equation out.

As each player previously playing retained his/her original set of lives, these players continued to have 3x lives.

However, for the new players joining, each new player had 3 lives. So the total number of lives these new players now have is 3 x 5 = 15.

So, we can now calculate the number of lives each player has after everyone joined.

We know that initially, the number of lives of the x players was 12x,  and after adding 5 more players who have a total of 15 lives, the total number of lives is (12x + 15).

Now, let's find out the number of lives each player has:

Total number of lives / Total number of players = Number of lives each player has

(12x + 15) / (x + 5) = Number of lives each player has

Algebraically solving for Number of lives each player has:

Number of lives each player has = (12x + 15) / (x + 5)

Now, we can find the final answer:

Let's put x = 4 (since we know that before new players joined, there were 4 groups of friends playing).

Number of lives each player has = (12 x 4 + 15) / (4 + 5)

Number of lives each player has = (48) / (9)

Number of lives each player has = 5.33

However, we cannot have a decimal number of lives, so we round it up to 6. So, each player now has 6 lives.

The final answer is 6.</s>",27,27.0,6.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can first create an equation to represent the amount of money Kaleb has in terms of dollars and cents.

Let x be the number of dollars Kaleb has, and let y be the number of cents (in hundreds) Kaleb has. This can be written as x dollars and y cents, or x dollars and 0.01y cents.

x dollars and y cents = x + (0.01 * y) dollars

Next, we can write an equation to represent how many dollars and cents Kaleb spent on the new game. This would look like:

8 dollars and 0 cents (i.e., just 8 dollars) = 8 dollars

We can also write an equation to represent how many dollars and cents Kaleb spent on each toy. Let z be the number of toys Kaleb bought.

2 dollars and 0 cents per toy = 2 dollars for one toy

Now, we can set up two more equations to represent Kaleb's original amount of money and the amount of money left over after he spends on the game and buys toys.

x dollars and y cents (original money) = x dollars and y cents (leftover money) - (8 dollars for game) - (2 dollars times z toys)

Finally, we can solve for z, the number of toys Kaleb can buy with the remaining money.

z = number of 2-dollar toys

number of 2-dollar toys = leftover money in terms of dollars and cents, divided by 2 dollars and 0 cents per toy

z = ((x + 0.01y) - 8 - (2 times remaining toys)) / 2

To make this equation easier to solve, it can be helpful to think in terms of whole numbers of dollars and cents. Let's say Kaleb's original amount was 12 dollars and 24 cents (12.24 in total). Rewriting Kaleb's original equation with just dollars yields:

12 dollars = (x dollars and y cents left over) - (8 dollars for game) - (2 dollars times z toys)

Similarly, we can set up equations for Kaleb's amount spent on the game and the number of toys he buys:

8 dollars = x dollars - (2 dollars times z toys)

We can solve for x (the total dollars Kaleb has left) by adding the two equations above:

12 = x - (2 z - 8)

Then, we can solve for z:

z = ((x - 12) + (2 times number of remaining toys)) / 2

At this point, we have an equation with only the unknown variable z, which we can solve by substituting our original equation for x as a function of z and y:

z = ((12 + 0.01y) - 12 - (2 times number of remaining toys)) / 2

Finally, we can isolate z:

z = (0.01y - (2 times number of remaining toys)) / 2

Now that we have an equation to represent the number of toys Kaleb can buy with his remaining money, we can use it to find the exact value of z (assuming we know the values of y and the number of remaining toys).

For example, let's say Kaleb bought the game for 8 bucks and has 4 cents left. If he wants to buy 5 more toys, we can calculate the number of 2-dollar toys he can afford:

y = 4
z = (0.01 * 4 - 2 * 5) / 2 = 2

So, Kaleb can afford 2 more toys (for a total of 7 toys).

If Kaleb spends more money on the game or more money on the toys, then the remaining amount of money would be less, so the number of toys Kaleb can afford would be smaller. Likewise, if Kaleb has more original money (or fewer original toys), then the remaining number of toys would be greater.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's first define some variables. Let's call the number of math problems Katie had to complete x. Then, we know that she had 7 pages of math homework, and each page had 9 problems, so she had a total of 9 * 7 = 63 math problems. Similarly, for reading homework, we'll call the number of reading problems Katie had to complete y. She had 3 pages of reading homework, and each page had 9 problems, so she had a total of 9 * 3 = 27 reading problems.

We're asked to find the total number of problems Katie had to complete, so we add x and y together: 63 math problems plus 27 reading problems gives us a total of 90 problems.

Putting this together, we can create an equation with our variables:

x = 63 (number of math problems)
y = 27 (number of reading problems)
x + y = 90 (total number of problems)

Now, let's solve for x, which will give us the number of math problems Katie had to complete.

x = 90 - y

Substituting y with 27 gives us:

x = 90 - 27

So, the number of math problems Katie had to complete was:

x = 63

Alternatively, we could have used a system of equations to find both x and y simultaneously. By setting up a system of equations with our variables, we could solve for both x and y at once.

x = 63 (number of math problems)
y = 9 * 3 (number of reading problems)
x + y = 90 (total number of problems)

Solving the system of equations would give us the exact number of math problems and reading problems Katie had to complete, but for our purposes, finding just the number of math problems should suffice.

The final answer is: Katie had to complete 63 math problems.</s>",90,90.0,63.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many songs came with each type of album.
   - 6 country albums: Each album had a lyric sheet and 9 songs, so we have 9 songs for each country album.
   - 2 pop albums: Each pop album had a lyric sheet and X number of songs. We don't know X yet, but we'll find it later.
   - Let x be the number of songs on each pop album. Rewrite the situation as an equation: 9 * 6 = 9 * 2 + x * 2 (the first term is the total number of songs from country albums, and the second term is the total number of songs from pop albums. We don't know x yet, but we can equate the two terms to find it).
   - Solving this quadratic equation, we get x = 18. Therefore, each pop album had 18 songs.

2. Now that we know how many songs came with each type of album, we can find how many songs Janet bought in total.
   - Since Janet bought 6 country albums, she bought 54 songs. (9 songs * 6 albums)
   - Since Janet bought 2 pop albums, she bought 36 songs. (18 songs * 2 albums)
   - Therefore, in total, Janet bought 90 songs. (54 songs + 36 songs)

The final answer is: Janet bought 90 songs, total.</s>",72,72.0,90.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, let's identify the variables and their meanings:
   - J: the amount Jerry made from mowing lawns ($)
   - W: the amount Jerry made from weeding ($)
   - E: the amount Jerry spent on eating ($) per week
   - N: the number of weeks Jerry's money will last ($)
   - L: the number of lawns Jerry mowed ($)
   

2. Next, we can set up two equations based on the information provided:
   
   a. Jerry's income from mowing lawns and weeding:
   J + W = 45 (dollars)
   
   b. Jerry's expenses and income:
   J + W - E*5 = N (weeks)
   

3. Simplify equation (b) by isolating N and identifying the remaining variables:
   J + W - 5E = 7N (weeks)
   J: the amount Jerry made from mowing lawns ($)
   W: the amount Jerry made from weeding ($)
   E: the number of times Jerry ate per week
   

4. Since J and W are the amounts Jerry earned from mowing lawns and weeding, respectively, and L is the number of lawns Jerry mowed, we can create a third equation:
   J = 14 + 5*L (dollars)
   

5. Substitute (3) into (a) to eliminate J, getting:
   W = 45 - 5L (dollars)
   

6. Substitute (4) and (5) into (b), getting:
   (14 + 5L) + W - 5E = 7N (weeks)
   (Expanding W)
   (14 + 45 - 5L) - 5E = 7N (weeks)
   (or)
   69 - 5LE - 5E = 490N (weeks)
   

7. Divide both sides by 490 to isolated N:
   N = (69 - 5LE - 5E) / 490 (weeks)
   

8. To find the final answer, we can write:
   {The final answer is}. N is the number of weeks Jerry's money will last, and we have found a formula to calculate it. 
   


In summary, the steps to solve this problem are to identify the variables, set up equations based on the information provided, simplify the equations, and then calculate the value of the variable we're trying to find (N) using the formula we created.</s>",9,9.0,8.0

2. If Adam sold 11 of the books and used the money earned to buy 23 new books, how many books would he have left? (Question)
3. The number of books Adam sold is 11. (Given)
4. Let x represent the number of books Adam has left after selling 11.
5. The total number of books he has (after selling 11) is 33 - 11, which is 22.
6. The number of new books Adam bought with the money earned from selling the 11 books is 23.
7. The total number of books Adam now has (after buying the 23 new ones) is 22 + 23, which is 45.
8. The number of books Adam now has (after buying the 23 new ones) is also x.
9. Connecting steps 7 and 8, we get 45 = x. (Equation)
10. We can solve this equation for x by subtracting 22 from both sides (since we know that 22 comes from the original 33 and leaving those books aside doesn't really change x).
11. The result is x - 22 = 23, which solves the original question.

Let's break this problem into smaller, more manageable steps.

1. Kaleb collected cans for recycling on Saturday and Sunday.

2. On Saturday, Kaleb filled 5 bags. Each bag held 4 cans, so Kaleb collected 4 x 5 = 20 cans on Saturday.

3. On Sunday, Kaleb filled 5 more bags (for a total of 10 bags). Since Kaleb filled 5 additional bags, the number of cans he collected on Sunday was the same as the number of cans he collected on Saturday (20). This means he filled each bag on Sunday with 4 cans, for a total of 20 cans on Sunday.

4. By adding the number of cans Kaleb collected on Saturday (20) and the number of cans he collected on Sunday (20), we can find the total number of cans Kaleb collected over the weekend.

5. The total number of cans Kaleb collected over the weekend is 20 on Saturday and 20 on Sunday, for a total of 40 cans. (20 from Saturday + 20 from Sunday = 40).

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each step separately.

1. Unpack the statement: ""Nancy was organizing her book..."" We can see that ""organizing"" is written in the present tense, so we can assume that this is a continuous action.

2. We now want to find out the type of books that are on the mystery and pictures shelves.

3. There are two shelves dedicated to mystery books and none of them are empty. We also know that Nancy had exactly 6 books on each of the mystery shelves, so we calculate the total number of books on the mystery shelves like this:

number of books on mystery shelves = 6 books per shelf * 2 shelves
number of books on mystery shelves = 12 books

4. Following the same steps as we did for the mystery shelves, we can calculate the total number of books on the shelves dedicated to picture books:

number of books on picture shelves = 6 books per shelf * 6 shelves
number of books on picture shelves = 36 books

5. Now we have information about the total number of books on both shelf types. We add them together to find the total number of books that Nancy has:

total number of books = total number of books on mystery shelves + total number of books on picture shelves
total number of books = 12 books + 36 books
total number of books = 48 books

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. Paul saved up 3！ dollars, and each week he receives ¡ for his allowance. If he receives 7！ dollars in total for his allowance this week, how many 5 dollar toys can he buy with the total amount he has?

1. Calculate Paul's saved up dollars: 3！ = 6 dollars

2. Add Paul's saved up dollars to the dollars he received for his allowance (3！ + 7!) to determine his total amount of dollars:

   3 ! + 7 ! = (3 * 3 * 3) + 7 * 3 * 3 = 48 dollars

3. Divide the total number of dollars by the cost of a toy (5 dollars) to find out how many toys he could buy:

   48 dollars / 5 dollars = 9.6 toys, but since we cannot buy decimal quantities of toys, we can round down to the nearest whole number:

<|assistant|>
Let's name the number of lives Wendy had at the beginning of this hard part of the game as x. 

After losing 8 lives due to the difficulty of this part, she now has x - 8 lives. This transformation can be written as:

x - 8 = lives after losing 8 lives in this part

Now let's name the number of lives she gains when she advances to the next level as y. Adding y to the number of lives Wendy has after losing 8 lives in this hard part will give us the total number of lives she'll have after advancing. This transformation can be written as:

(x - 8) + y = total number of lives after advancing

Finally, we're given that Wendy will gain an additional 39 lives in the next level. Since we don't know if this number is added to the initial number of lives or the current number of lives, we'll write this as:

y = 39 (we'll find the value of y later)

Now we can substitute y's expression into the transformation for the total number of lives:

(x - 8) + 39 = total number of lives after advancing

Let's simplify:

x - 8 + 39 = total number of lives after advancing

x - 8 + 39 - 39 = total number of lives after advancing - 39

x - 8 = total number of lives after advancing - 39

Now we have the transformation for the total number of lives Wendy will have after advancing from this hard part and advancing to the next level while gaining an additional 39 lives. Let's solve this transformation by finding the value of x:

x = total number of lives after advancing - 39

Substituting the known variable total number of lives after advancing {which is represented with {The final answer is} } with the expression we found above for the total number of lives after advancing:

x = (x - 8) - 39

Let's rewrite as:

x - 39 = x - 8

x - x + 8 = -39

-39 = 8

Since we know that -39 is not a valid result in this case, our initial transformation may not have enough information to find the value of x. This means that we're missing some information to calculate the total number of lives Wendy had at the beginning, and we can't find the final number of lives she'll have after advancing while gaining an additional 39 lives in the next level.

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of files Katie had at the beginning with the variable x. So, we have x = 85. When Katie deleted 40 files, the number of files left on her computer was x - 40.

Next, let's denote the number of files that Katie put into folders as y. The total number of files after organizing them into folders is the sum of the files in folders and the files that weren't organized into folders. So, we get:

(number of files not organized into folders) + (number of folders * number of files in each folder)

Let's call the number of folders that Katie created z. We can now set up the equation:

x - 40 + z * 5 = (number of files not organized into folders) + z * 5

To solve for z, we need to isolate it. First, we need to get z on one side:

z * 5 = (x - 40) + z

Now, we can solve for z:

z = (x - 40) / (-4) + 5

However, we don't want negative values or decimals, since there can't be a negative number or a fraction of a folder.

So, we need to check whether our result is reasonable or not. We found that z depends on x. The larger the value of x, the smaller the absolute value of (x - 40) / (-4). Therefore, if x is smaller than or equal to 40, then the term (x - 40) / (-4) is either zero (if x = 40) or a negative number (if x < 40). This means that z will be an integer only if we assume that only folders with zero or one file were created. If we assume that x > 40, then z will be a positive integer.

If we assume that at least one folder was created, then z is a positive integer, and it represents the number of folders that Katie created.

If we assume that Katie created only one folder (with all the remaining files), then z = |(x - 40) / (-4)| + 1 (since there should be at least one folder).

If Katie created no folders at all (x - 40 < 0), then we should have deleted all the files, which is not possible in our problem.

Therefore, if we assume that Katie created folders, then Katie ended up with a positive integer number of folders {z}.

In summary, we can solve the given problem and come up with a final answer by breaking down the problem into smaller steps, representing variables for unknown quantities, and solving mathematical equations. The final answer will depend on the initial number of files (x) and the assumption whether Katie created at least one folder or not.</s>",9,9.0,0.0

To find how much money Will made in those two days, we first need to determine how many hours he worked on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Will worked for 8 hours.

On Tuesday, the problem gives two different possibilities for how many hours he worked:

Case 1: Will worked 8 hours on Tuesday.

In this case, we can create a table to organize the hours and earnings for each day:

| Day | Hours | Earnings (8 dollars per hour) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monday | 8 | 64 dollars |
| Tuesday | 8 | 64 dollars |

| --- | --- | --- |
| Monday | 8 | 64 dollars |
| Tuesday | 2 | 16 dollars |
| Total | 10 | 80 dollars |

To determine which case is correct, we can compare the earnings from Case 1 and Case 2.

Case 1:

Will earned 128 dollars in those two days.

Case 2:

Will earned 80 dollars in those two days.

Since Case 1 results in a higher earnings amount, we can conclude that Will worked 8 hours on Tuesday, and we can use the table created in Case 1 for our final answer.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for total number of items when the number of items produced and sold changes. The formula is:

Total number of items = Initially produced number of items + Number of items sold

Let's apply this formula step by step:

1. Initially produced number of cupcakes: Carol made x cupcakes.

2. Number of cupcakes sold: Carol sold 6y cupcakes.

3. Newly produced number of cupcakes: After selling some cupcakes, Carol produced y*27 more cupcakes, so the total new number of cupcakes she produced is y*(27+1) = by (y+1) times.

4. Total number of cupcakes: The formula for total number of items is:

Total number of cupcakes = x + 6y + (y+1)*b.

5. Since we have all the variables in the formula, we can set up an equation and find the values of x, y, z.

.  For the . school bake sale ; Carol made 28 * 19 ? cupcakes.

. If she sold 6 * 20 of them and then 27 more, : how . many cupcakes would . she have?

Let x = 28 * 19, y = 20, and z = 27.

28*19 = x

1200 = x

x = 1200

x = 1200 cupcakes

6*20 = 6y

120 = y

y = 120

z + y = (y+1)*27

z + 120 = 27*(y+1)

z = 27*(y+1) - 120

The final answer is: Carol had (27*(y+1) - 120) cupcakes in total.

[Note: Since we cannot simplify this expression any further with the given values, the expression remains as it is]

[Note: The initial number of cupcakes (1200) will always remain unchanged, so that's the amount of cupcakes Carol started with. The other numbers (y and z) vary depending on how many cupcakes she sells and how many she produces.]

To solve this problem, we first need to identify the variables:
- A = total number of team members
- x = number of members who didn't show up
- y = remaining number of members who did show up
- z = number of points scored by each member who did show up
- p = total number of points scored

We also have some information given to us:
- A = 14
- x = 7
- z = 5

Using this information, we can create a system of equations to represent this scenario:

1. The total number of team members (A) is equal to the number of members who did not show up (x) and the remaining number of members who did show up (y):
   A = x + y

2. The number of team members who did not show up (x) is equal to the difference between the total number of team members (A) and the remaining number of members who did show up (y):
   x = A - y

3. We know that each member who did show up (y) scored z points. We can find the total number of points scored (p) by multiplying the number of points scored by each member who did show up (zy) by the number of members who did show up (y):
   p = zy

Let's substitute y from equation 2 into equation 3:

4. Solving for y using equation 2:
   y = A - x

5. Substitute y into equation 3:
   p = z(A - x)

By solving for A in equation 4 and substituting it into equation 5, we can find the total number of points scored (p):

6. Solving for A in equation 4:
   A = x + y
   A = x + (A - x)
   A = 2A - x
   A = x/2 + y/2
   Let's assume that our team has an equal number of men and women, so we know that x/2 = 3 and y/2 = 6.
   A = 9

7. Plugging in A from equation 6 into equation 5:
   p = z(A - x)
   p = 5*(9 - 7)
   p = 45

<|assistant|>
Let's denote the names of the team members as A, B, C, D, and E, where A and B were the two members who did not show up. During the game, each of the showing up members (C, D, and E) scored 6 points.

Our system of equations looks like this:

5 = A + B + C + D + E (total number of team members)
3 = C + D + E (number of showing up members)
12 = C * 6 + D * 6 + E * 6 (total points scored by showing up members)

Solving the first equation for A and B gives:

A = 5 - B - C - D - E
B = 5 - A - C - D - E

Using our newly defined variables, we can rewrite our second equation as:

3 = C + D + E = (5 - B - C - D - E) + (5 - A - C - D - E) - (A + B)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

3 = 2C - A - B

We can use this equation to eliminate C or B in our third equation, resulting in:

12 = (5 - B) * 6 + (5 - A - B) * 6 + E * 6

At this point, we can see that since E is the only variable we haven't dealt with, we can solve this equation for E instead of for the total number of points:

E = 12 / (6 * (5 - A - B))

Finally, we can use our first equation to substitute for A or B in our expression for E, and we'll end up with a formula that depends only on the numbers we chose for A and B:

{The final answer is }
E = (5 - A) * 2 / (6 * (8 - A - B)) or E = (5 - B) * 2 / (6 * (8 - A - B)) points.</s>",18,18.0,8.0

Step 1: Identify the given information
- Oliver is helping a librarian put away books at the library
- There are 46! books in total
- The librarian takes 10 books and leaves Oliver with the rest
- Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf

Step 2: Calculate the number of books left with Oliver
- The librarian takes 10 books, leaving Oliver with the rest
- Let x be the number of books left with Oliver
- Substitute the values in the expression for the number of books left with Oliver: 46! - 10 = x
- Solve the equation: 46! - 10 = x
- We don't have enough information to solve for x, as we don't know the value of !
- We can assume that the librarian takes 10 books randomly, so we can say that there are 46-10=36 books left with Oliver

Step 3: Calculate the number of shelves Oliver needs
- Oliver fits 4 books on a shelf
- Let y be the number of shelves Oliver needs
- Division rule: y = (x / 4)
- We already know that x = 36, so substitute that into the expression for y:
- y = (36 / 4)
- y = 9 shelves

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the given information to create systems of equations. Let's represent the number of coins in each pile of quarters and dimes as x and y, respectively. Similarly, we can represent the total number of coins Luke has as z.

First, we know that each pile of quarters has 3 coins, so we can set up an equation for the number of quarters in each pile:

3 = x / 5

We can also create an equation for the number of dimes in each pile:

3 = y / 10

Using the given information that Luke has 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes, we can create two more equations that relate the number of coins in each type of pile to the total number of coins:

5x = z
5y = z

Let's solve this system of equations using a strategy called the elimination method. We'll use addition and subtraction to make one of the equations (say y) a function of the other variable (x).

Multiplying the first equation by 10 and the second equation by -3:

30 = 10x
-9 = -3y

Adding these equations:

21 = x - 3y

Now we have eliminated y from the system, and we can find x in terms of z:

5x = z

x = z / 5

Substituting this expression for x into the equation we found for y:

-3(-3y) = -9
y = 3

Now, we can find the total number of coins Luke has:

z = 5(x) + 5(y)
z = 5(z / 5) + 5(3)
z = 15z / 5 + 15
z = 30

Luke has a total of 30 coins. {The final answer is 30.}</s>",30,30.0,30.0

- To convert tons to pounds, 1 ton = 2000 pounds
- Gwen recycled 2200 pounds of paper, 1 point for every 3 pounds
- The number of points Gwen earned from recycling = points per pound x pounds recycled
- Gwen earned points for recycling 5 tons of paper
- gwen's points = (1 point per 3 pounds) * (2000 pounds per ton) * 5 tons
- gwen's points = 5000 points

Step 3: Find the number of points Gwen's friends earned
- For every 3 pounds of paper recycled, Gwen's friends earn 1 point
- Gwen's friends recycled 13 tons of paper, 1 point for every 3 pounds
- The number of points Gwen's friends earned from recycling = points per pound x pounds recycled

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The band is holding a concert. There are two options given: a regular concert and a concert with more expensive tickets. Let's notate this as either ""a"" for the regular concert or ""b"" for the expensive concert.

   a. Regular concert: The cost of each ticket is not explicitly stated, but we know that Haley bought 3 tickets at a cost of $4 each for herself and her friends. Let's say there are x total tickets sold for the regular concert, and the cost per ticket is y. This means that:

   x * y = (3 * 4) for Haley and her friends

2. Expensive concert: If the band is holding an expensive concert, let's say w is the cost per ticket for this concert. We know that Haley bought an additional 5 tickets for this concert for herself and her friends. This means that:

   w * 8 = (3 * 4) + (5 * w) for Haley and her friends, as well as the extra tickets.

3. Putting it all together: Now let's combine the regular and expensive concert options:

   (a) Regular concert:

   x * y + 3 * y = n for all tickets sold

   (b) Expensive concert:

   (x + 8) * w = n for all tickets sold

   (c) Ticket price per option:

   y = $4

   w > $4 (since these tickets are more expensive)

   (d) Number of total tickets sold:

   x + 8 <= n (since we know for sure that there are at least 11 tickets sold)

   (e) Total amount spent by Haley:

   $4 * 3 + (x - 3) * y + 5 * w (for the tickets she bought, accounting for a possible difference in the number of regular and expensive tickets)

   Let's call the total amount spent h.

4. Solving for x and w:

   (a) Regular concert:

   x * y + 3 * y = n

   Substituting $4 for y:

   x * 4 + 12 = n

   (b) Expensive concert:

   (x + 8) * w = n

   Substituting $4 for y and w > 4:

   (x + 8) * (4 + delta) = n

   delta >= 0

   (c) Combination and simplification:

   x * 4 + w * (x + 8) = n

   Let g be the difference between the total number of tickets sold (n) and the number sold for the regular concert (x):

   g = n - x

   Substituting g for n and breaking it up:

   4x + 32w - 4(x + 8) = g

   Factor and simplify:

   8w = 32w - 32

   Simplify:

   8w = -(32-32)

   Since the left side is positive, this creates a contradiction and tells us that g can't be negative, meaning that g = 0. Therefore, x = n and:

   w = {The final answer is:}. The amount of money Haley spent is:

   $4 * 3 + n * 4 - 4(n - 3) = 4 * 3 + 4n - 16n + 48

   Simplify:

   $h = 4n - 12n + 48 = -8n + 48

   $h = 48 - 8n$

   Notice that h is a linear function of n, which represents the total number of tickets sold. Therefore, we can interpret the expression as a cost per person if we divide it by the total number of people. Specifically, h / n is:

   $h / n = -8 + 6 = -2$

   By plugging in some values for n, we can verify that h goes down by $2 per person as n increases, representing a group discount for buying tickets in bulk. This is consistent with the fact",32,32.0,2.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we'll need to use substitution and arithmetic to determine each value as it's introduced. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. First, let's identify all the unknown variables: G (George's original amount of money), ! (amount of money George received for his birthday), M (price of the new game), T (amount George spent on the game). We can represent this in an equation:

   G = original money
   ! = birthday money
   M = price of new game
   T = money spent on game

2. George received some money for his birthday. We don't yet know how much, but let's represent it as an ! (exclamation point). We'll add this to George's original amount to get his new total:

   G + ! = new total

3. George spent ! 38 dollars on a new, exclamation point game. We'll subtract this from his new total to find how much money he has left:

   G + ! - ! 38 = remaining money

4. Let's represent this remaining money as a new variable, K (for ""kiwi"" because ""k is for kash!""). We can replace G + ! - ! 38 with K:

   K = remaining money

5. We can now substitute variables to simplify the above equation:

   G + ! = K + ! 38

6. We're almost there! Let's represent the price of the new game, M, as a multiple of !:

   M = ! x M

7. We can now replace G and ! 38 with their respective values from step 5:

   ! x M + ! = K + ! 38

8. Since we want to find how much money George has now, let's replace K with this new value:

   ! x M + ! = George's current money

9. Let's factor out the !:

   ! (M + 38) = George's current money

10. Finally, let's find the value of M by dividing each side by (M + 38):

   ! = M + 38

11. We can now substitute M (the price of the new game) back into step 8 to find George's current total:

   ! (M + 38) = George's current money

12. We can solve for M by dividing each side by M + 38:

   G's current money = (M + 38)/(M + 38) x ! = !

13. We can substitute the value of M from step 10 into this equation:

   ! (M + 38) = George's current money

14. We've now found an expression that equates to George's current money. Remember, we're solving for G's current money, so let's represent it as J and then substitute the above expression into it:

   J = [(M + 38)/(M + 38)] !

15. Finally, let's replace the value of M from step 10 into our expression for J:

   J = [(M + 38)/(M + 38)] !

   J = [(! + 38)/(! + 38)] !

   The final answer is: [(! + 38)/(! + 38)] !

This is all the work we need to do, but we can go a step further by substituting the original values for G and !:

16. Let's say that when George first received his money, he had 150 dollars, and on his birthday, he received 50 dollars. Using the above equation for J, we can calculate how much money he has now:

   J = [((50 + 38)/(50 + 38)) x 200]

   J = [(88)/(88)] x 200

   J = 200

   The final answer is: George now has 200 dollars.

Let's start by identifying the variables and their values.

? = number of birds
? = number of cages
4 = number of cages with bird
c = number of cages without bird (complement of 4 out of ?)
? = number of parrots in one cage (constant value)
! = number of parakeets in one cage (constant value)

We can represent this information in equations:

4 = ? - c     (The total number of cages is equal to the number of cages with birds minus the number of cages without birds)

cages with parrots: 4 * ? = parrots_total   (Each cage with birds has ? parrots)
cages with parakeets: 4 * ! = parakeets_total   (Each cage with birds has ! parakeets)

parrots + parakeets = total_birds    (The total number of birds is equal to the number of parrots and parakeets)

Let's solve the equations to find the values of ? and total_birds.

4 = ? - c     (Equation 1)

4*? = parrots_total    (Equation 2)

4*! = parakeets_total    (Equation 3)

parrots_total = parrots + parakeets    (Equation 4)

To start, let's find the total number of parrots, parrots_total, using Equation 2.

parrots_total = 4 * ?

Next, let's find the complement of c, that is, the number of cages with birds.

c = ? - 4    (from Equation 1)

Now, let's find the total number of parakeets, parakeets_total, using Equation 3.

parakeets_total = 4 * !

Next, let's find the total number of birds, total_birds, using Equation 4 with the values of parrots_total and parakeets_total we've just found.

total_birds = parrots + parakeets

total_birds = parrots_total + parakeets_total    (from Equations 2 and 3)

total_birds = (4 * ?) + (4 * !)

We've found the value of total_birds. It's time to combine all the equations to make our final calculation clearer and simpler to follow.

total_birds = ? * (4 * !) / (4 - (? - 4))

Let's divide both numerator and denominator by 4 to eliminate 4 from the equation.

total_birds = (? * !) / (1 - (? / 4))    (The final answer is)

This formula gives us the total number of birds in the store based on the number of cages, the number of cages with birds, the number of parrots and parakeets in each cage, and the number of parrots and parakeets in the store.</s>",40,40.0,4.0

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Kaleb bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy. (! Kaleb : bought 14 boxes !)
2. He gave 5 of these boxes to his little brother. (and gave 5 to his little brother.)
3. Each box contains 6 pieces of candy. (! of chocolate candy ? and each box ? has ? 6 : pieces inside it,)
4. Let's calculate how many pieces Kaleb gave to his brother. We know he gave 5 boxes, and each box has 6 pieces. So:
   - Kaleb gave 5 boxes.
   - Each box has 6 pieces.
   - Using the formula for multiplying, we get:
   5 boxes x 6 pieces = 30 pieces.
5. Now let's figure out how many pieces Kaleb still has. We know he bought 14 boxes and gave 5 to his brother. So we can use subtraction to find out how many boxes Kaleb still has:
   - Kaleb bought 14 boxes.
   - He gave 5 boxes to his brother.
   - Using the formula for subtraction, we get:
   14 boxes - 5 boxes = 9 remaining boxes.
6. Let's find out how many pieces Kaleb still has by multiplying the number of boxes left by the number of pieces in each box:
   - Kaleb still has 9 boxes.
   - Each box still has 6 pieces (since Kaleb hasn't eaten or given away any more pieces).
   - Using the formula for multiplying, we get:
   9 boxes x 6 pieces = 54 pieces.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Let x be the number of picturesRobin uploaded from her phone (excluding the ones from her camera). Since she uploaded a total of 31 pictures from her phone, we have:

x = 31

2. Let y be the number of picturesRobin uploaded from her camera. Since she uploaded a total of 5x pictures from her camera and from her phone, we have:

5x = 31 (pictures from camera) + 31 (pictures from phone)

Substituting the value of x from step 1, we get:

5x = 31*2

x = 6

So, Robin uploaded 6 pictures from her phone. We will denote the number of pictures in each album as n.

3. Let's find out how many albums Robin created. Since each album contains the same number of pictures, we have:

6 (pictures from phone) = 9n (pictures in each album)

n = 6/9 (pictures in each album)

The total number of albums created by Robin is:

9 = 9n (number of albums)

So, Robin created 9 albums.

4. Now we have found out that each album contains n pictures. Let's find out how many pictures were uploaded to Facebook in each album. After uploading on Facebook, each album will have n pictures and 9*n = 9n pictures are available. Now we know that Robin has 31 pictures on her phone, and uploaded all on Facebook. In each album, we know there are n pictures. So, how does that total up with respect to Facebook? She has already uploaded 6 pictures from her phone, so we shouldn't count that in the albums. Therefore, we can calculate the remaining pictures in the albums using the quantity that is missing from Facebook.

Number of pictures on Robin's phone = 31 (excluding pictures from camera)

Number of pictures on Robin's camera = 5x (only from camera, excluding pictures from phone) = 15*6 = 90

Total pictures = 31 + 90 = 121

Number of pictures uploaded to facebook = 31 (from phone) + 5x (from camera) = 121

Number of pictures remaining (in albums) = 121 - (Number of pictures from phone + Total pictures uploaded to facebook per album)

Number of pictures remaining (in albums) = 9n - 6

Number of pictures from each album (on facebook) = n - (Number of pictures remaining (in albums)/9)

Let P be the number of pictures from each album (on Facebook)

P = n - 121/(9*(9*n))

We know that each album has n pictures, so our equation becomes:

9n = 6*81 (number of pictures in each album)

This simplifies to:

n = 729/540

The number of pictures from each album (on Facebook) is:

P = 729/540 - 121/(9*(9*729/540))

Now, we know the value of P. So, our final answer is:

{The number of pictures from each album (on Facebook) is: 64}

This indicates our final answer, which is not an integer (rounded to 64). However, this value makes sense from the context since each album has 9 different pictures, and as we increase the number of pictures, the quality degrades and may become unrecognizable.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's first identify the variables we're working with:

- x represents the number of lawns Mike mowed over the summer
- y represents the number of dollars Mike earned from mowing lawns
- z represents the total number of dollars Mike made over the summer (y + 69)
- b represents the cost of each new mower blade (24)
- g represents the cost of each 5 dollar game (5)

Next, let's set up equations to represent the amount Mike made from mowing lawns and the amount he spent on new mower blades:

- y = 5 dollars per lawn times the number of lawns he mowed (x)
- b times the number of new mower blades he bought (z')

Let's also establish that the total amount Mike made over the summer is y dollars, and he still has some money left over after spending 69 dollars and buying the new mower blades:

- z = y + 69
- g times the number of 5 dollar games he could buy with the leftover money (h)
- h = z - (69 + z')

Now, we can substitute some of these equations into others to eliminate redundant variables. For example:

- y = x * 5
- z' = b * z'
- z = y + 69
- h = (y + 69 + b * z') - (69 + b * z')

Let's manipulate the remaining equations until all of the unknowns are expressed in terms of x, which represents the number of lawns he mowed:

- h = (x * 5 + 69 + b * z') - (69 + b * (x * (5/b))
- h = x * (5 - b * (5/b))
- h = (5/b) * x * (5 - b)

Now we have a formula that tells us how many 5 dollar games Mike could buy with the money he has left, in terms of x. We're looking for how many he could buy in total, so add up all of the games (5 dollar games and the unknown number) that he bought this summer:

- g * (x * (5 - b) + z') = g * x * (5 - b) + g * z'
- g * x * (5 - b) = g * z' - g * x * (5/b) * b
- g * x * (5 - b) = g * (z' - x * (5/b))

Finally, we can write out our finished solution by substituting our earlier expression for z':

- {The final answer is: } g * x * (5 - b) = g * (b * h' - x * (5/b))

The formula above represents the total number of games (in dollars) that Mike could buy this summer, where h' represents the number of lawns he cut beyond the first 69 launches, or:

- h' = x - (5/b) * x * (5 - b)
- h' = x * ((b * (5/b)) / (b - 5))

Plugging this formula into our final equation, we can fully solve for the total number of 5 dollar games Mike could buy this summer:

- {The final answer is: } g * x * (5 - b) = g * (b * x * ((b * (5/b)) / (b - 5)) - x * (5/b))

This expression will result in a number for the dollar amount of 5 dollar games Mike could buy after accounting for the number of lawns cut and the cost of new mower blades.</s>",9,9.0,5.0

To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps and create a chart to keep track of the information provided. The steps and final answer will be shown clearly at the end.

Step 1: Understand the given information
- Maria bought a total of .2 new chairs and .2 new tables.
- .
- She spent 8 minutes on each piece of furniture to put it together.

Step 2: Create a chart to keep track of the information
| Item                   | Quantity   | Time to Assemble (min) |

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Rachel took 6 pictures at the zoo on vacation. (We'll represent this with the variable x.)
2. She also took 9 pictures at the museum on vacation. (Let's call this y.)
3. She deleted 11 pictures from all of her vacation photos, but we don't know which locations these photos were from. (Let's call the total number of deleted photos d.)
4. Now let's find the total number of pictures Rachel has left from her vacation. (This is the number we're looking for.)

First, we need to find how many pictures Rachel has left from the zoo. As we know, she took 6 pictures there, and then she deleted d pictures. How many of those deleted pictures were from the zoo? Let's call the number of pictures deleted from the zoo d_z. Since we don't know how many pictures were deleted from the museum (but we do know some were), we'll call the total number of pictures deleted from the museum d_m, and we'll assume that Rachel deleted an equal number of pictures from both locations. (In other words, d_z = d_m = d/2.)

So, how many pictures does Rachel have left from the zoo? It's the number she took, minus the number she deleted from there (6 - d_z):

x - d_z = z

Next, we need to find out how many pictures Rachel has left from the museum. She took y pictures there, and then she deleted d_m (which equals d/2) pictures from there:

y - d_m = m

Now we know how many pictures Rachel has left from both locations. Adding these quantities gives us the total number of pictures Rachel has left from her vacation:

z + m = Total number of pictures left from vacation

Let's plug our equations into this last equation:

x - d_z + y - d_m = Total number of pictures left from vacation

Expanding this equation, we get:

x + y - (d_z + d_m) = Total number of pictures left from vacation

We know that d is equal to the number of pictures deleted from both locations, and we've already figured out that d_z and d_m are equal. So using our assumptions from step 4, we can simplify this to:

x + y - d = Total number of pictures left from vacation

There we have it! With our assumptions and our equations, we've found the number of pictures Rachel has left from her vacation. Here's how we'd write the final answer:

{The final answer is: }

x + y - d = [Number of pictures Rachel has left from vacation]

You might think about trying to figure out how many pictures were deleted from each location, using the information available to us. Feel free to give it a shot!

Remember, we're assuming that Rachel deleted an equal number of pictures from both the zoo and the museum. But let's say we knew how many pictures Rachel deleted from the museum--call it d_m. How many pictures must she have deleted from the zoo, so that the total number of deleted pictures is d?

d_z = d - d_m

Now, we're ready to find the number of pictures Rachel has left from the zoo. She took x pictures there, and then she deleted d_z pictures from there:

x - d_z = z

We know how many pictures Rachel has left from the museum. She took y pictures there, and then she deleted d_m pictures from there:

y - d_m = m

So now we know how many pictures Rachel has left from each location. Adding these quantities gives us the total number of pictures Rachel has left from her vacation:

z + m = Total number of pictures left from vacation

Plugging our equations into this last equation gives us:

x - d_z + y - d_m = Total number of pictures left from vacation

Expanding this expression, we get:

x + y - (d_z + d_m) = Total number of pictures left from vacation

Again, since we're assuming that d_z and d_m are equal (call the number of pictures deleted from the zoo d_z), we can simplify:

x + y - d = Total number of",4,4.0,4.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first need to understand the information provided. There are three types of cookies: chocolate chip, oatmeal, and regular cookies. Maria has a total of 40 chocolate chips, 25 chocolate chips, and 19 oatmeal cookies. We also know that she makes bags with a certain number of cookies and that she has made a total of 5 bags.

Let's call the number of cookies in each bag x.

For the chocolate chip cookies, we have:

40 chocolate chips = x chocolate chip cookies

Dividing both sides by the number of chocolate chips in each cookie, we get:

40 chocolate chip cookies = x chocolate chip cookies

1 chocolate chip cookie = 0.4 chocolate chips

0.4 chocolate chips = 1 cookie (equality)

Now we have a conversion factor to convert from chocolate chips to cookies. Since we're interested in the number of bags she can make, we'll use this conversion factor to find the total number of chocolate chip cookies she has in these 5 bags.

5 bags X 0.4 chocolate chip cookies per bag = 2 chocolate chip cookies total

Notice that with only 2 chocolate chip cookies and 25 total chocolate chip cookies, we wouldn't be able to make all 5 bags with 1 chocolate chip cookie per bag. To fix this, we need to adjust the conversion factor to reflect that we might need more than one cookie to equal a chocolate chip.

We'll continue our analysis under this condition. First, we find how many chocolate chip cookies there are in total:

40 chocolate chips X (1 chocolate chip to 0.4 cookies) conversion factor = 10 chocolate chip cookies

25 chocolate chips X (1 chocolate chip to 0.4 cookies) conversion factor = 6.25 chocolate chip cookies

Now that we have found how many chocolate chip cookies there are, we'll repeat the previous calculations with chocolate chip cookies:

5 bags X 10 chocolate chip cookies per bag = 50 chocolate chip cookies total

5 bags X 6.25 oatmeal cookies per bag = 31.25 oatmeal cookies total

Now we have found the total number of cookies in all 5 bags. For simplicity, let's find the total number of cookies by rounding ""31.25"" to ""31"" cookies.

Remember that Maria made 5 bags. To calculate how many bags she could make with all her remaining cookies, we'll need to find out how many cookies are in each bag.

For this, we'll use the 2 conversion factors found earlier—one for chocolate chip cookies and one for oatmeal cookies.

Total remaining cookies = 40 (chocolate chip cookies) - 50 (chocolate chip cookies already accounted for) - 19 (oatmeal cookies already accounted for) = 16 cookies

For calculation simplicity, we'll assume each remaining cookie is an oatmeal cookie:

1 cookie (oatmeal cookie) = 0.625 chocolate chip cookies = 1 oatmeal cookie

(1 oatmeal cookie to 0.625 chocolate chip cookies) conversion factor

(1 oatmeal cookie to 1 oatmeal cookie) conversion factor

Now we have the conversion factors needed to calculate how many chocolate chip cookies and how many oatmeal cookies are in each bag if each remaining cookie is considered an oatmeal cookie.

Let's call the number of cookies in each bag y.

x chocolate chip cookies + x oatmeal cookies per bag = y

Let's replace all the cookies values (from the conversion factors found earlier) to get an equation:

10 chocolate chip cookies + x (1 oatmeal cookie for every 0.625 chocolate chip cookies) = y

Now we have a equation to solve for x.

From the previous calculations, the conversion factor for chocolate chip cookies is 1 oatmeal cookie for every 0.625 chocolate chip cookies. That means, for each chocolate chip cookie, we need 0.625 oatmeal cookies. To find how many chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies are required to get a full bag, let's set up another equation:

x chocolate chip cookies + (0.625 x x) oatmeal cookies = y

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first need to identify the unknown variables. In this case, the price of one rose (p for price) and the price of one daisy (d for discount) are both unknown. We also need to determine the discount being offered during the sale. Let's call this discount rate (r for rate).

Now, let's break down the given information:

- April had a flower sale where each flower was discounted by 30%.
- Zoe bought 8 roses and 2 daisies.
- Each rose costs p dollars.
- Each daisy costs d dollars.
- Zoe received a discount of 30% (r%) on her total purchase.

To calculate the price of a rose, we first determine the discount factor (1 - 0.3) since Zoe received a discount of 30%. We then multiply this discounted factor by the original price (p) of the rose. Therefore, p' = p * (1 - 0.3) gives us the discounted price of one rose.

Similarly, for the daisies, we multiply the price (d) by the discounted factor (1 - 0.3) to calculate the discounted price (d').

The total cost for Zoe's purchases is the sum of the discounted prices of the roses and daisies (8 * p' + 2 * d'). Since she received a discount (r%) on the total amount, we need to add the discounted amount (r%) back to this sum to calculate the original amount paid by Zoe.

Let's break down the algebraic calculations:

1. Calculate the price of one rose (p'):
   p' = p * (1 - 0.3)

2. Calculate the price of one daisy (d'):
   d' = d * (1 - 0.3)

3. Calculate the total cost of Zoe's purchases:
   Total cost = 8 * p' + 2 * d'

4. Calculate the discounted sales price:
   Discounted sales price = (1 - 0.3) * Total cost

5. Calculate the original price:
   Original price = Discounted sales price / (1 - 0.3)

To present our final answer clearly, we end with {The final answer is} at the end of our calculations.

{The final answer is:}

1. Calculate the price of one rose (p'):
   p' = p * (1 - 0.3)
   p' = p * 0.7

2. Calculate the price of one daisy (d'):
   d' = d * (1 - 0.3)
   d' = d * 0.7

3. Calculate the total cost of Zoe's purchases:
   Total cost = 8 * p' + 2 * d'
   Total cost = 8 * p * 0.7 + 2 * d * 0.7

4. Calculate the discounted sales price:
   Discounted sales price = (1 - 0.3) * Total cost
   Discounted sales price = (0.7) * (8 * p * 0.7 + 2 * d * 0.7) = (0.49) * (8p + 2d)

5. Calculate the original price:
   Original price = Discounted sales price / (1 - 0.3)
   Original price = (0.49) * (8p + 2d) / (1 - 0.3)

By substituting the actual values for p and d, we can calculate the actual costs.

{The final answer is: Zoe spent $XX.XX on her flower purchase at the April's sale.}

Let's fill in the blanks by substituting the actual values obtained as per the given scenario:

1. Calculate the price of one rose (p'):
   p' = p * (1 - 0.3)
   p' = $Y.Z0 * 0.7 = $X.ZZ

<|assistant|>
To find out how many books Bianca has in total, we need to count the number of books on each of the eight mystery shelves (8 shelves times the number of books on each shelf) and the number of books on the four picture book shelves (4 shelves times the number of books on each shelf).

Let's represent the number of books on each shelf as an expression:

Mystery shelf: x books
Picture shelf: y books

We know that each mystery shelf has exactly 8 books (as directed by Bianca), so x = 8. On the other hand, we don't know how many books Bianca puts on each picture shelf, so we leave y undefined for now.

The total number of mystery books is the product of the number of shelves times the number of books on each shelf:

Total number of mystery books = 5 shelves * 8 books per shelf = 40 books

Similarly, we can calculate the total number of picture books:

Total number of picture books = 4 shelves * y books per shelf

Since we don't know the value of y, we can't find out the exact number of picture books yet.

The total number of books Bianca has is the sum of the number of mystery books and the number of picture books:

Total number of books = Total number of mystery books + Total number of picture books

Putting everything together, we get:

Total number of books = 40 mystery books + 4y picture books

Here, our unknown is y, the number of books per picture shelf. We can set up an equation by equating the total number of books we calculated using just the given information (40 mystery books) to the total number of books using both mystery and picture books (from the equation above):

40 mystery books = 40 mystery books + 4y picture books

Subtracting 40 mystery books from both sides, we get:

0 = 4y picture books

Since this equation is only valid when y is 0, it implies that Bianca has no picture books (i.e. Y = 0). So there are no picture books to count. Therefore, the total number of books Bianca has is just the number of mystery books she placed on the shelves:

Total number of books = 40 mystery books

The final answer is thus:

{The final answer is 40 mystery books.}

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break the problem down step by step:

1. John had a binder with baseball cards. Initially, he had 3 cards on each page, so the total number of cards was 3 times the number of pages (let's call this x), or 3x cards in total. We can write this as:

   3x = initial number of cards

2. John added 8 new cards, so the new total number of cards was 8 more than the original total. Let's call this y:

   8 + 3x = new total number of cards (y)

3. After adding the new cards, John had a total of 16 old cards. Let's call this z:

   16 = z (number of old cards)

4. Now, John wanted to put all the cards into the binder. Since we know each page had 3 cards before, let's find out how many pages it would take to store all these cards:

   a. To store the new cards, we know that y = initial number of cards + 8 (the 8 new cards). So, let's rewrite the initial number of cards as y - 8:

     y = 3x + (y - 8)

     We can simplify this expression by moving the (y-8) term to the left-hand side:

     x = (y - 8) / 3

   b. To store the old cards, we know that z = 16 old cards. Again, let's replace the initial number of cards as y - 8, and find the number of pages that's required to store the old cards:

     x = z / 3

   c. Since we're striving for a single answer, why not tie the expressions together? To find how many pages the total number of cards (y) require, we need to sum up the necessary pages for the new cards (a) and old cards (b).

   d. By combining steps (a) and (b), we obtain the number of necessary pages for the total number of cards (y):

   x = (y - 8) / 3 + z / 9

   If we let x be the number of pages for the new binder, then using this expression, we can see how long John's list takes to get his baseball cards in order again.

   The final answer is: {The number of pages required is [rounded to the nearest integer]}

   For example, if John has 24 old cards and adds 24 new cards, we can solve the equation and determine that he needs approximately [rounded to the nearest integer] pages to fit everything comfortably in his binder with three cards per page.</s>",8,8.0,24.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to find the missing values.

Let x represent the number of brownies Isabel made in addition to the 3 she originally baked.

We know that Isabel needed a total of 5 brownies for her party. This means that she originally made 3 brownies and then made an additional x brownies, for a total of 5 brownies.

5 = 3 + x

Substituting this expression for 3 into the next piece of information given to us, we can find out how many cups of flour Isabel used for each brownie:

! cups of flour were used for each brownie.

! = p/3, where p is the total number of cups of flour used.

Using this, along with the fact that Isabel used 5 p/3 cups of flour in total, we can find the value of p:

5p/3 = 5 * !

p = 15 * !

Therefore, the number of cups of flour used for each brownie is !.

Now, we want to find out how many total cups of flour Isabel used in the original 3 brownies, as well as in the x additional brownies:

! cups of flour were used for each of the first 3 brownies.

Let q represent the number of cups of flour used for each additional brownie.

x brownies were made in addition to the original 3, each using q cups of flour.

!x q = x*q

Adding this to the ! cups of flour used for the original 3 brownies gives us the total number of cups of flour used:

5p/3 + xq = p

Substituting the expressions we found for p and xq, we can solve for q:

! * x + x * q = 15 * !

Simplifying this, we get:

q = (15 - 3) * !

Putting it all together, we can now calculate the total number of cups of flour Isabel used:

(! * 3) + (x * ! * (15 - 3)) = ! * 5

Finally, we can see how many cups of flour Isabel still needs by finding the difference between the total number of cups she used and the total number of cups she used up:

! * 5 - (! * 5) = the number of cups still needed

By substituting the expression we found for x into this equation, we can find the exact number of cups of flour Isabel still needs:

! * 5 - (! * 5 + (x * ! * (15 - 3))) = the number of cups still needed

To summarize, our complete solution to the problem is as follows:

- Isabel originally baked 3 brownies, using ! cups of flour for each one. - In total, she used ! * 3 = ! cups of flour for these original brownies. - She then baked an additional x brownies, each using ! * (15 - 3) = q cups of flour. - In total, Isabel used ! * (3 + x) = ! * 5 = p cups of flour for all the brownies she made. - To find out how much flour Isabel still needs, we can calculate the difference between the total amount of flour she used and the total amount she used up: ! * 5 - p = the number of cups still needed.

So, the final answer is: ! * 5 - (! * 5 + (x * ! * (15 - 3))) = the number of cups still needed.</s>",10,10.0,3.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we have the ratio of the number of cupcakes Maria made to the number of cupcakes she sold for the school bake sale. This ratio is 19 :. Let's call the number of cupcakes she sold x.

2. We know that Maria sold 0.5 of her initial number of cupcakes, which is equivalent to selling half of them. So, we can find the number of cupcakes she sold by multiplying the initial number by 0.5.

3. Let's call the number of additional cupcakes she made after selling half of them y. We know that the total number of cupcakes Maria had after making y more cupcakes is the sum of the number she made at the beginning and the additional ones, that is, 19 + y.

4. Now, we know that after making y more cupcakes, Maria had a total of x and 19 + y cupcakes. We can express this situation using another ratio: x : (19 + y).

5. To find the total number of cupcakes Maria had, call it z, we can use the addition principle and sum the number she had before selling some and adding y more, x after selling half of them and making y more, and those she made after selling half and making y more. Therefore, z = 19 + x - 0.5x + y.

6. Using the first two ratios we obtained, we find:

    19 : x = x : (19 + y)

7. Solving this equation by cross-multiplication, we obtain:

    x(19 + y) = 19x

   Then, we get:

    x(19 + y) - 19x = 0

    x(19 - 19y) = 0

    x = 0, or y = 19/19y

   If y is not zero, we eliminate the option of x being zero, meaning that Maria has at least one cupcake. This is our assumption, and we are going to stick with it.

    x = (19 * z) / (19 + y)

    Substituting our last expression for x in z, we find:

    z = 19 * [(19 * z) / (19 + y)] / ((19 + y) / (19 + y)) + y

    Simplifying:

    z = (19 * y) / (19 - y)

8. So, we have the number of cupcakes made by Maria as:

    z = (19 * y) / (19 - y)

    Substituting y = 10, we find:

    z = (19 * 10) / (19 - 10)

    Rounding up to the nearest integer, we get:

    z = 200

    Therefore, the final answer is:

    {The final answer is 200}

<|assistant|>
Step 1: Identify the known information
- Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair
- He spent $28 at the 'dunk a clown' booth and used the remaining tickets on rides
- Each ride cost 4 : tickets

Step 2: Find the amount spent at the 'dunk a clown' booth
- Let x be the number of tickets spent at the 'dunk a clown' booth
- Tom spent $28 at this booth
- 28 tickets were used here
- $28 = 28x
- Solving for x, we get x = $28 / 28 tickets = 1 ticket costs $1

Step 3: Find the number of tickets used on rides
- Let y be the number of tickets used on rides
- Tom used y tickets on rides
- Remaining tickets are (40 - 28) = 12 tickets
- Of these, y tickets were used on rides (which we have already calculated in the previous step)
- Hence, (40 - 28 - y) = 4 tickets were used on rides from the initial 40 tickets
- Solving for y, we get y = (40 - 28 - 4) / 4 = 12 tickets used on rides from the initial 40 tickets

Step 4: Find the number of ridesTom could go on
- Let z be the number of ridesTom could go on
- Each ride costs 4 : tickets
- Now, using all the tickets Tom has (initial and from 'dunk a clown' booth), we can find the number of rides he could go on
- Number of rides = (40 + (1 - 1) * (28)) / 4
- Substituting the expression for y in (1 - 1)(28) tickets, we get
- Number of rides = ((40 - 12) + (12 - 12)) / 4 = 20 rides

Step 5: The final answer
- Tom could go on 20 rides using all his tickets. {The final answer is 20 rides}.

To solve this problem, we can apply the formula for finding the number of students at the end of the year:

Number of students at the end of the year = Number of students at the beginning of the year + Number of students who joined - Number of students who left

Let's represent this formula using the symbols provided in the question:

?  ! In fourth ! grade there ; were ; 31 , students at ; the start of the year.

31 students were in fourth grade at the beginning of the year.

During the ; year ! 5 ! students . left.

Let's represent this symbolically:

x students left during the year.

11 new, students . came to school.

Let's represent this symbolically:

y new students joined during the year.

Now we can substitute these values into the formula above:

Number of students at the end of the year = 31 - x + y

We want to find this number, so let's write our equation as:

?  = 31 - x + y

Finally, when we're ready to calculate the answer, we can simply substitute the values of x and y (which we haven't yet found) into this equation and calculate the result.

To find x and y, we can use the given information that the total number of students who left and joined is equal to the difference between the number of students at the beginning and end of the year.

Let's represent this symbolically:

31 - ? = -x + y

We can then separate the variables:

-x = ? - 31

y = ? - 31 + x

Finally, we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). We can solve these equations simultaneously to find x and y, and then substitute these values into our final calculation.

Here's what that looks like in math notation:

-x = ? - 31 (1)

y = ? - 31 + x (2)

Let's solve these equations separately:

From (1), we see that x is a constant times ?, or:

x = m ?

Substituting this into equation (2), we get:

y = ? - 31 + m ?

Now, we have our new equation in terms of the single unknown, ?:

y = (1 - m) ? + 31

Since we're looking for the number of students at the end of the year, we can represent this symbolically using our new formula:

? = (31 - x - y) / 2

Let us substitute value of y in terms of ? into this equation. Remembering that y = (1 - m) ? + 31, we get:

? = (31 - x - (1 - m) ? - 31) / 2

Let us now simplify it:

? = (-x + m ?) / 2

We see that x and m determine the number of students who left, and the fraction of students who joined relative to the number of students at the end of the year. We can solve this equation for x in terms of ?, m, and the current number of students:

x = 2 ? - 2 m ?

Finally, let's substitute this value of x into the equation we found earlier for y. Remembering that y = (1 - m) ? + 31, we get:

y = ? - ? + 31 = ? - 31(1 - m)

Now, we're ready to calculate the final answer to the question!

? = (31 - 2 ? + 31(1 - m)) / 2

? = (31 + 31(1 - m)) / 2

To find our final answer, clearly indicate our answer with {The final answer is}. The formula for the number of students at the end of the year is:

{The final answer is} (31 + 31(1 - m)) / 2

And we've also determined expressions for x and y, which we can use to represent the number of students who left and joined separately if needed.</s>",37,37.0,2.0

Now, let's verify that the quantities we calculated match the given conditions:
- Maria bought 35 green towels and some white towels. This is reflected in the first row.
- Maria gave 34 of her towels (35 - 1) to her mother. This is reflected in the third row.
- Maria and her friend bought 21 towels, of which none are green. This is reflected in the fourth row.

Adding up the total number of towels, we can see that they match the given conditions (96).

Let's calculate the number of towels that Maria has left.
- Maria originally had 50 towels, 35 green and 15 white. She gave her mother 34 of her green towels (35 - 1), leaving her with 35 green towels. From this, we can calculate that she currently has a total of 35 green and 15 white towels, or 50 towels. This is reflected in the table.

Therefore, with our calculations verified, we can see that Maria ended up with 50 towels.

Step 1: Calculate the number of correct answers in the first half.
Adam answered 8 questions in the first half, and we know he answered 8 of them correctly. Therefore, the number of correct answers in the first half is 8.

Paul's age when he started collecting cans for recycling is not explicitly stated, so we do not have enough information to calculate this. Let's assume for simplicity that Paul started collecting cans at age 0.

Paul's can-collecting activity can be modeled as a function that takes the day of the week as an input and returns the number of full bags he filled that day. If we represent this function as bags(weekday), then we can express how many bags Paul filled on Saturday and Sunday as bags(Saturday) and bags(Sunday), respectively.

Here's how we can step-by-step solve this problem:

1. How many cans are in each bag?
   If each bag had 8 cans in, we can represent this by letting can per bag be 8.

2. How many bags did Paul fill on Saturday?
   We're given that Paul filled 6 bags on Saturday. Therefore, the number of cans that Paul picked up on Saturday is 6 bags times 8 cans per bag:
   6 bags * 8 cans per bag = 48 cans

3. How many bags did Paul fill on Sunday?
   We're given that Paul filled 3 bags more than he did on Saturday. Let's define Sundays bag count as x. We can set up an equation that represents the number of bags Paul filled on Sunday to help us find x:
   bags(Sunday) = bags(Saturday) + 3

4. Solve the equation for bags(Sunday).
   To do this, we can subtract bags(Saturday) from both sides of the equation:
   bags(Sunday) - bags(Saturday) = x - 6
   We can then add 6 to both sides of the equation:
   bags(Sunday) = x

5. We can substitute the can-per-bag value into the equation for bags(Sunday).
   This gives us the following:
   bags(Sunday) = x
   x cans per bag = x * 8

6. Finally, we can add up the number of cans Paul picked up on both Saturday and Sunday to get the total number of cans he collected.
   Total number of cans = 48 cans (Saturday) + x cans (Sunday)

So, we know how many bags Paul filled on Saturday and Sunday, how many cans are in each bag, and how to calculate the number of bags he filled on Sunday from the number of bags he filled on Saturday. Putting it all together, we can construct an expression that calculates the total number of cans Paul picked up.

The final answer is:
  Total number of cans = 48 cans (Saturday) + (Number of bags Paul filled on Sunday) * (Number of cans in each bag) = 48 cans (Saturday) + x (x cans per bag)

  To solve for the total number of cans Paul picked up, we'd need to find x from step 4 and then substitute it into the expression we just constructed.</s>",72,72.0,4.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the information provided to create an equation that represents the number of points earned based on the amount of recycled paper. Here's how:

Let x be the number of points Bianca earned from recycling y pounds of paper (where y > 0). Since Bianca earned one point for every pound of paper recycled, we have:

x = y (1 point per pound)

Let z be the number of pounds of paper Bianca's friends recycled (where z > 0). Since Bianca and her friends recycled a total of 27 pounds, we have:

y + z = 27 (total pounds recycled)

Using the rate given, we can create an additional equation that represents the points earned by Bianca and her friends:

x + z/3 = 24 + 3z (points earned based on rate)

Combining this with the first equation, we arrive at a system of two equations and two unknowns:

x = y (1 point per pound)
x + z/3 = 24 + 3z (points earned based on rate)

To solve this system, we can use the substitution method. Solving for y in terms of x gives:

y = x (1 pound per point)

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

x + z/3 = 24 + 3(x/3) (using the fact that 1 point per pound and 1 pound per point are equivalent)

Simplifying this gives:

x = 16 + z/3 (total points earned)

Now, we can use the given information to substitute values into this equation:

x = 16 + z/3

x = 16 when z = 0 (no recycling from friends)

x = 24 when z = 0 (Bianca did all the recycling)

x = 36 when z = 12 (Bianca and her friends recycled 12 pounds together)

From these, we can reason that the number of points earned increases linearly with the total number of pounds recycled (up to a point), at a rate of 1 point per pound for Bianca and 1 pound per point for her friends. This is a function of both the pounds recycled and the points earned, as shown by the general formula:

x = 16 + z/3 (total points earned)

To find out how many points Bianca and her friends earned when they recycled 36 pounds, we can substitute the known values into the equation:

x = 16 + z/3

x = 16 + 12/3

x = 24 + 4

Therefore, when Bianca and her friends recycled 36 pounds, they earned a total of 28 points. The final answer is:

The final answer is 28 points.</s>",9,9.0,28.0

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of people in the group, the total number of friends, the original number of chicken, the number of chicken cooked for the group, and the number of chicken cooked in total. We can use mathematical equations to represent these unknowns and then solve for the unkowns.

Let's start by identifying variables:

! denotes an unknown quantity
x denotes the number of people in the group
y denotes the total number of friends
z denotes the original number of chicken
a denotes the number of chicken cooked for the group
b denotes the total number of chicken cooked

We can use equations to represent these unknowns based on the given information:

1. Ratio of the number of people in the group to the number of friends:
   x : y = 3 : Friends

2. Original number of chicken:
   z = Number of chicken before cooking

3. Number of chicken cooked for the group:
   a = Number of chicken cooked for the people in the group

4. Total number of chicken cooked:
   b = Total number of chicken cooked

5. Each person receives the same amount of chicken:
   Number of chicken each person gets = xth person gets = yth person gets

We can now use these equations to solve for the unknowns:

1. Find x and y:
   x : y = 3 : Friends

   We don't know both x and y, so we'll choose one and solve for the other using the ratio.

   x = 3
   y = Friends

   Solve for Friends:
   Friends = y

   Substitute 3 for x in the ratio:
   3 : Friends = 3 : y

   Solve for y:
   Friends = y
   3y = 3

   Divide both sides by y:
   Friends = 3

2. Find z:
   z = Original number of chicken

3. Find a:
   a = Number of chicken cooked for the people in the group

   We know the total number of chicken cooked for the group, but we also know that each person receives the same amount of chicken. Therefore, we can find a by multiplying the number of chicken cooked in total by the number of people in the group and dividing by the number of people:
   10 = b : x
   10 : x = b
   10 : x = b : y
   10y : xy = b

   Substitute for z in terms of x and y:
   z = Original number of chicken

   Solve for a:
   a = b - z
   a = b - (b : y) * y
   a = (b - b:y) * y
   a = (b - 10y) * y / x

4. Find each person's amount of chicken:
   Each person gets the same amount of chicken

   Solve for the amount each person gets:
   Each person gets = xth person gets = yth person gets
   1 chicken : (b - 10y) * y / (x * y)

We now know the final answers:

Unknown: The number of socks John has at the end, let's call it x.

Given:
- John had ! 33 socks. This is a slashed zero (zero with a line through it), which is read as ""approximately thirty-three"". Let's say John had around 33 socks.
- John threw away 19 old socks that didn't fit.
- John bought 13 new socks.

We can simplify this:

Number of socks before (initial): ! 33 = approximately 33
Number of socks removed: 19 old socks = -19
Number of socks added: 13 new socks = 13

x = initial - removed + added

x = 33 - 19 + 13

x = 16

Final answer:

After buying new socks and throwing away old socks that didn't fit, John would have approximately 16 socks, {The final answer is: John has approximately 16 socks}.</s>",27,27.0,16.0

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the given information:
   - The school's ? baseball team ? had ! 2 ? new : players. (Here ? is unknown. Let's assume it's 'x'.)
   - and : 6 . returning players.
   - If the , coach put them , into groups with 4 ? players , in ; each group, how many groups ! would there ! be?

2. Determine the number of total players:
   - Total players = new players + returning players
   - Total players = x ? 2 ? - 6
   - Total players = x - 8

3. Find the number of groups:
   - Number of groups = Total players / Groups per group
   - Number of groups = (x - 8) / 4?

4. Calculate the value of '?' from given statement:
  - From the first given statement: x ? 2 ? new : players
  - Let's assume new players are 'm' 
  - Returning players are 'r'
  - Total number of players is 't'
  - 't' = 'm' + 'r'
  - '?' (x) = 't' - 2 'm' - 'r'
  - '?' (x) = 'm' - 'r'
  - Therefore, '?' (x) is dependent on new and returning players.

5. Replace '?' in Step 3 with the value:
   - Number of groups = (m - r) / 4

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we will break it down into smaller steps and use variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let's call the number of rooms that have already been painted as x, and let's call the total number of rooms as n.

The painter needs to paint 6 rooms in a building. Since we know that x rooms have already been painted, the remaining number of rooms that need to be painted is (n-x) rooms.

There are a few ways this problem could be extended. Let's consider one possible scenario: if we're given the number of rooms the painter has already painted (say, x = 2), we can use this information to calculate how much longer it will take him to finish the remaining (n-x) rooms.

Here's how we can do it:

1. The painter needs to paint a total of 6 rooms. Some of these rooms (x = 2) have already been painted, so the remaining rooms that need to be painted are: (n-x) = (6-2) = 4 rooms.

2. Each room takes 5 hours to paint, so the total number of hours it takes to paint all 6 rooms is: 6 * 5 = 30 hours.

3. The painter has already painted x = 2 rooms, and each room takes 5 hours to paint. So the number of hours he has already spent on painting is: 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

4. We want to calculate how much longer it will take the painter to paint the remaining (n-x) = 4 rooms. Because some of the rooms have already been painted, we can't simply use the formula 5 * 4 = 20, which would give us the total number of hours it takes to paint the remaining rooms. Instead, we need to calculate the number of hours it will take him to paint the remaining rooms starting from when he finished the last previously painted room.

Let's say the painter finished painting the last previously painted (""already painted"") room at time t = 0. At this point, the painter has spent 10 hours painting the x = 2 rooms, leaving him with (-10) hours left to paint the remaining (n-x) = 4 rooms.

After time t = 0, the painter starts painting the remaining 4 rooms, at a rate of 5 hours per room. How many hours will it take him to paint these remaining rooms? Using the formula for the present value of future amount (PMT), we can calculate the number of hours it will take him to complete the remaining 4 rooms starting from time t = 0:

- The interest rate is 0 (the painter isn't earning interest), so the interest rate is often omitted from the formula, making it a simple present value formula: PV + PMT * (1 + i)^t = FV .

- The future value (FV) is the total number of hours it will take the painter to paint the remaining rooms. The current time is t = 0, and the future value is the number of hours it will take him to complete the remaining 4 rooms. So t = 0, and FV is the same as the ""later paint time"": how much later will it take to paint the remaining rooms.

- The number of payments (PMT) will be the number of hours it takes to paint each remaining room, times the number of remaining rooms: (4 rooms) * (5 hours per room) = 20 total hours.

- PV is the present value, or the number of hours the painter has already spent painting. Since the painter already spent 10 hours painting the x = 2 rooms and he finished his previous work at time t = 0, PV is -10 hours.

- Now let's put it all together, plugging in our values:

    PV = -10 hours
    
    PMT = 5 hours per room (the number of hours it takes the painter to paint one room) times the number of remaining rooms (4). So PMT is 20 hours as we discussed above.

    t = 0 (the current time, when the painter started painting the remaining 4 rooms)

    FV, the future value, is the total number of hours it will take the painter to paint the remaining rooms.

                    The formula for the present value of future amount is:
                    PV + PMT * (1 + i)^t = FV

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. We are given that there are 22 customers in the restaurant's section A.
2. After a certain amount of time, 14 of those customers left.
3. The number of customers left in section A is found by subtracting the number of customers that left from the total number of customers in section A.
4. To calculate the number of customers left in section A, we use the formula:
   - Customers left = 22 - 14
   - Customers left = 8
5. We are also told that : represents ""proportional to"" or ""in the ratio of."" In this case, : represents the relationship between the number of customers that left and the number of tables that are either empty or have fewer than 4 people.
6. The formula for finding the number of empty or partially occupied tables is:
   - Number of empty or partially occupied tables = Total number of tables needed to accommodate the remaining customers / Number of customers that each table can accommodate
7. We are given that there are 4 people at each table.
8. We first calculate the number of people that remain after some customers leave:
   - Number of people remaining = Total number of customers after some leave - Number of customers that left
   - Number of people remaining = 22 - 14
   - Number of people remaining = 8
9. The number of empty or partially occupied tables needed to accommodate the remaining people is found using the formula:
   - Number of empty or partially occupied tables = Number of people remaining / Number of people per table
   - Number of empty or partially occupied tables = 8 / 4
   - Number of empty or partially occupied tables = 2
10. Now we already know that there are 2 empty or partially occupied tables.
11. We need to find the total number of tables that the waiter has.
12. To compute this, we find out how many tables with 4 people at each table we need to accommodate the remaining customers.
13. This calculation involves finding the ratio between the remaining customers and customers that each table can accommodate.
14. The formula for finding the total number of tables (both empty/partially occupied and those that are completely full) is:
   - Total number of tables = Total number of tables needed to accommodate the remaining customers + Number of empty/partially occupied tables
15. To calculate the former, using the same ratio, we get:
   - Total number of tables needed to accommodate remaining customers = Number of remaining customers / Number of people per table
   - Total number of tables needed to accommodate remaining customers = 8 / 4
   - Total number of tables needed to accommodate remaining customers = 2
16. The waiter also has the 2 empty/partially occupied tables, so the total number of tables he has is:
   - Total number of tables = Total number of tables needed to accommodate remaining customers + Number of empty/partially occupied tables
   - Total number of tables = 2 + 2
   - Total number of tables = 4
17. The final answer is:
   - The waiter has 4 tables in his section A.

To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. Roger has a total of 120 pieces of clothing to wash.
2. Roger puts 48 pieces of clothing in one load, but decides to split the remainder into 9 equal loads.
3. Let's represent the number of pieces of clothing in each small load with the variable x.
4. Since the total number of pieces in the small loads is the remainder (120 - 48) divided by 9, we can set up an equation:
5. (120 - 48) / 9 = x
6. After simplifying, we get:
7. x = 12 (the remainder when divided by 9)
8. Now we know that each small load contains 12 pieces of clothing.
9. Roger puts 48 pieces of clothing in one load, and 9 times 12 is 108, so the total number of pieces of clothing in all the small loads is:
10. (108 pieces from the small loads) + 48 pieces from the first large load = total number of pieces of clothing washed
11. Substituting our known values, we get:

Step 1: Identify the given information and variables

- There were 10 students in fourth grade at the beginning of the year
- X students left during the year
- Y new students came to school during the year
- The final number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year is unknown

Step 2: Find the change in student population due to departures (X)

- The number of students at the end of the year (N) is equal to the number of students at the start of the year (10) minus the number of students who left during the year (X)
- N = 10 - X

Step 3: Find the change in student population due to new students (Y)

- The number of students at the end of the year (N) is also equal to the number of students at the start of the year (10) plus the number of new students who came during the year (Y)
- N = 10 + Y

Step 4: Combine the two equations to find a system of two equations with two unknowns (X and Y)

- N = 10 - X (Eq. 1)
- N = 10 + Y (Eq. 2)

Step 5: Simplify one of the equations to eliminate the unknown variable (X) and get Y in terms of N (Eq. 3)

- N = 10 - X (Eq. 1)
- N = 10 + Y (Eq. 2)
- Substitute Eq. 1 into Eq. 2 to get Eq. 3
- 10 - X = 10 + Y
- X = -Y
- Substitute X = -Y into Eq. 1 to get Y in terms of N
- N = 10 - (-Y)
- N = 10 + Y

Step 6: Substitute the expression for Y from Eq. 5 into Eq. 2 and solve for N to get the final number of students (N) at the end of the year

- N = 10 + Y (Eq. 2)
- Substitute Y = N - 10 (from Eq. 5) into Eq. 2
- N = 10 + N - 10
- N = N
- The final number of students (N) at the end of the year is simply the number of students (N) at the end of the year, as the left side and the right side of the equation now represent the exact same quantity.

The final answer is: {The final number of students (N) in fourth grade at the end of the year is N}. 

Alternative Solution:

Instead of following the steps above, you could set up a chart or table to easily compare and organize the changes in student population:

| Type of Change | Number of Changes  |
| --- | --- |
| Students left   | X                     |
| New students came | Y                     |
| **Total Change** | **X - Y**          |
| **Ending Population (N)** | **10 + (X - Y)** |

In this table, we added a column with the **Total Change** (i.e., the difference between the changes due to departures and those due to new students), and another column with the **Ending Population (N)**, which is simply the sum of the starting population and the total change.

You could also convert this chart to equations using the methods shown above. 

Either method works, as both lead to the same final answer for N.

<|assistant|>
To find out how many extra flowers Bianca picked, we first need to calculate how many flowers she used to make each bouquet. Let's call the number of flowers in each bouquet x.

Bianca picked 39 tulips. Since we don't know the exact number of tulips in each bouquet, x could be any number. However, we do know that her total number of tulips (39) is less than the total number of tulips she used for all of her bouquets (let's call this number y). Therefore, we have:

39 < y   (1)

Bianca also picked 49 roses. Let's call the number of roses in each bouquet r. Then, the total number of roses used for all of her bouquets is r times the number of bouquets she made (let's call this number b).

49 = r * b   (2)

Now, we know that Bianca used a total of 81 flowers for all of her bouquets (let's call this number f). Combining the number of tulips and roses, we get:

f = 39 + 49 * b    (3)

Next, let's find the total number of flowers she used for the tulips. Using the fact that y is greater than or equal to 39 (since Bianca used at least that many for her bouquets), we have:

y >= 39   (4)

Let's call the number of tulips in each bouquet y/b. Then, we get:

y = (y/b) * b   (5)

We also have:

y = 39 * (total number of bouquets)   (6)

Combining (5) and (6), we get:

(y/b) * b = 39 * b   (7)

Simplifying, we have:

y/b = 39   (8)

Multiplying both sides by b, we get:

y = 39 * b   (9)

Let's substitute (9) into (3), and then we can solve for b:

f = 39 + 49 * b    (10)

f = 39 * b + 49 * b   (11)

f = 88 * b   (12)

Dividing both sides by 88, we get:

b = f / 88   (13)

We already know that Bianca used a total of 81 flowers. So let's call that number t. Then, from (13), we get:

t = f / 88   (14)

We also have:

t = 39 + 49 * b   (15)

Using (14), we substitute t for f/88:

t = 39 + 49 * (f / 88)   (16)

We now have a system of two equations with two unknowns: (1) and (16). To find the number of extra flowers that Bianca picked, we find the difference between the total number of flowers she picked and the number she used for all of her bouquets:

extra flowers picked = total number of flowers picked - total number of flowers used   (17)

We can substitute (8) and (16) into (17):

extra flowers picked = (y/b) * b + (39 + 49 * (f / 88)) - (39 + 49 * (f / 88))   (18)

Simplifying, we get:

extra flowers picked = (y - 39) / b   (19)

But we know that y is greater than or equal to 39 (from (4)), so there are no extra tulips. Therefore, we can see that the extra flowers picked are just the roses she did not use:

extra flowers picked = 49 * (total number of bouquets - b)   (20)

We can substitute (9) into (20):

extra flowers picked = 49 * (b * (y",7,7.0,49.0

Let's break this question into smaller parts and tackle them one by one.

1. Emily bought 4 : new chairs and 2 new ! tables for ? her house.

To simplify this part, let's say that each new chair costs x dollars and each new table costs y dollars. This means that Emily bought a total of 4x new chairs and 2y new tables, where the question mark represents an unknown quantity.

2. Emily spent 8 dollars ; on ? each piece ; furniture : putting it , together.

This part is a bit tricky. We're told that Emily spent 8 dollars to put together each piece of furniture. We don't know yet what a piece of furniture is - it could be a chair, a table, or something else entirely. Let's say that the unknown quantity represents the cost of putting together a single piece of furniture.

3. How many ? minutes . Did it . Take : her : to finish?

This part asks how many unknowns of minutes it took Emily to finish putting together all of her new furniture.

Let's assign a variable to the total cost of the furniture: C = 4x + 2y. Let's also assign a variable to the total time it took Emily to put together all of the furniture: t. With these assumptions, let's calculate the remaining variables: 

1. Emily bought a total of x dollars worth of new chairs: 4x

2. Emily bought a total of y dollars worth of new tables: 2y

3. Emily spent a total of 8 dollars on putting together all of the furniture: 8(4x + 2y)

4. Emily's total cost for furniture and assembly was C: C = 4x + 2y + 8(4x + 2y)

Putting it all together, let's substitute these values into the time calculation:

t = 8 minutes per piece x [Number of chairs + Number of tables]

t = 8 minutes per piece x [4x + 2y]

t = [32x + 16y] minutes to finish

Now we can say: C = 4x + 2y + 8(4x + 2y), and t = [32x + 16y] minutes.

{The final answer is:} C and t are both unknowns, but we can find their values by solving our two equations simultaneously. Let's substitute C into the time formula:

t = [32x + 16y] minutes

t = [32x + 16y] minutes

C = 4x + 2y + 8(4x + 2y)

These two equations involve the same variables, x and y, so we can substitute x and y values into one equation and check them against the other to see if they're valid. This is called checking solutions, and it's an important part of double-checking your work to ensure that it makes sense. The most common mistakes students make with equations like these involve substituting variables into the wrong equations - this is not a common mistake, but it does happen!

Let's check our answers by substituting a few x and y values into both equations and checking the results. Let's say, for example, that x = 10 (meaning that Emily bought 10 new chairs, each worth $x) and y = 2 (meaning that Emily bought 2 new tables, each worth $y). 

When we substitute these variables into our equations, we get:

Equation 1: C = 40 + 2x + 16y

C = $40 (the cost of the 10 chairs) + $20 (the cost of the 2 new chairs) + $16 (the cost of assembling the chairs) + $32 (the cost of the 2 new tables) + $32 (the cost of assembling the tables) + $64 (the cost of assembling all of the furniture)

C = $252 (the total cost of Emily's new furniture)

Equation 2: t = [32x + 16y] minutes

t = [320 + 16(2)] minutes

t = [512] minutes

Let's cross-check this by substituting the same values into our second equation",48,48.0,512.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the question to calculate the number of birds at the pet store. Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 bird cages at the pet store, represented by A.

2. Each cage has 2 parrots, represented by p. So, we can calculate the number of parrots in terms of the number of cages: 

    Number of parrots = Number of cages x Number of parrots per cage

    This is equivalent to: p = Ac

    Substituting the given values, we can find the number of parrots:

    p = 6 x 2

    p = 12

3. In addition to parrots, the store has parakeets. Let's call the number of parakeets q. We know that there are 7 parakeets in each cage. However, since we don't know the exact number of cages containing parakeets, we can't directly calculate the number of parakeets.

4. We can only calculate the total number of parakeets by finding out the number of cages containing parakeets and multiplying it with the number of parakeets in each cage:

    Total number of parakeets = Number of cages with parakeets x Number of parakeets in each cage

5. Let's call the number of cages containing parakeets c1. To find out the value of c1, we can use the information that the sum of all cages, including the ones with parrots and parakeets, is still 6:

    Total number of cages = Number of cages with parrots + Number of cages with parakeets

    This is equivalent to: A = Ap + c1

    Substituting the given values, we can calculate the value of c1:

    A = 6 + c1

    A - Ac = 6 + c1 - 12

    A - 6 = 6 + c1

    A = 12 + c1

    c1 = A - 12

6. Using this value of c1, we can find the exact number of parakeets at the store:

    Total number of parakeets = c1 x Number of parakeets in each cage

    This is equivalent to: q = c1q1

7. Combining steps 3, 4, and 6:

    Total number of birds = Total number of parrots + Total number of parakeets

    Total number of birds = p + q

    This is equivalent to: B = p + q

8. Substituting the values that we found:

    B = 12 + c1(7)

    Final answer: The total number of birds at the pet store is B. {The final answer is B.}</s>",54,54.0,7.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first identify what variables represent what. Here's how I'm interpreting the information:

- Dave has a total of 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts.
- Dave wants to wash all of his shirts before school.
- By some point in time (let's call it t), Dave has only washed a certain number (x) of his short sleeve shirts and a certain number (y) of his long sleeve shirts.

Now let's break this down into equations and see if we can figure out what values x and y could possibly have.

1. Dave has a total of 20 long sleeve shirts that he has washed by time t.
   - This tells us that the number of long sleeve shirts Dave has washed (y) is related to the total number of long sleeve shirts (27) and the total number of long sleeve shirts he has washed (20) by time t as follows:
  y = 0.74074074... (a recurring decimal) * 27
2. Dave has a total of 20 * 2 = 40 shirts that he has washed by time t.
   - This tells us that the combined number of short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts that Dave has washed by time t (z) is related to the total number of shirts Dave has washed (40) and the number of short sleeve shirts he has washed (x) by time t as follows:
   z = x + y
3. We know that Dave has a total of 20 * 5 = 100 shirts that he hasn't washed by time t (let's call this number w).
4. We also know that Dave has a total of 100 shirts that he needs to wash before school.

Now we can create a system of linear equations from these relations and use Cramer's rule to solve for x and y:

x + 0.74074074... * 27 = 40

First, let's find the determinants Dx and Dy:

Dx = |1,  0.74074074..., -27/5| = 1 * 27/5 - 0.74074074... * 1
Dy = |0.359259259...,  0, -27/5| = 0.359259259... * 0 - 27/5 * -1/5

Next, let's create the augmented matrices:

|1,  0.74074074..., -27/5|
|0,   1        |
|0,   -27/5   |

|0.359259259...,  0, -27/5|
|x,  y        |
|0,   -27/5   |

Finally, we can use Cramer's rule to calculate x and y:

x = Dx / |1,  0.74074074..., -27/5|
y = Dy / |0.359259259...,  0, -27/5|

After a few rounds of decimal approximation, we can see that x = 4.03... Short sleeve shirts and y = 19.82... Long sleeve shirts. But what does this mean? Does Dave actually have fractional shirts?

Well, based on our equation for z, we know that z = 4.03... + 19.82... = 23.85... Shirts. But we also know that Dave has already washed 20 * 2 = 40 shirts, which leaves us with only 100 * (1 - 0.8) = 20 shirts left to wash. This means that our answers are actually 4 Short sleeve shirts and 19 Long sleeve shirts that Dave hasn't washed yet, for a total of 23 Short sleeve shirts and 36 Long sleeve shirts (for a total of 59 shirts). The final number of shirts that Dave has washed by time t is 40 as required.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break down this problem into steps:

1. Haley took 50 pictures at the zoo during her vacation. We'll call this number of pictures z. {The final answer is the value of z}.

2. Haley also took 8 pictures at the museum during her vacation. We'll call this number of pictures m. {The final answer is the value of m}.

3. Later, Haley deleted 38 pictures in total. We don't know how many of these pictures she deleted from the zoo or the museum, so let's call this number d. {The final answer is the value of d}.

4. How many pictures does Haley have left from her vacation? We can set up an equation to find this. At the zoo, she has z - d pictures left. At the museum, she has m remaining as well. Let's call the total number of pictures she has left from both places l. We can create an equation to represent this:

   z - d = l (zoo)
   m = l (museum)

   Combining these equations and solving for l, we get:

   z - d = m
   l = m + z - d
   {The final answer is the value of l}.

5. But we also know that the total number of pictures she has left is l. Using this in our equation for the museum, we can find m:

   m = l (museum)
   
   Using our final equation for l, we have:

   m = l - (z - d) (museum)
   
   Substituting l from our previous equation:

   m = (m + z - d) - (z - d)
   m = z - d (museum)
   
   We can also substitute this value for m back into our equation for l and find its numerical value:

   z - d = m = z - d (total)
   l = 2(z-d)
   
   {The final answer is the calculated value of l}.

So, the total number of pictures Haley has left from her vacation is twice the number she deleted, plus the number of pictures she took at the zoo and the museum and hasn't deleted (which is the same as the number of pictures she took at the zoo since she hasn't deleted any of those).

In summary, the number of pictures Haley has left is twice the number she deleted (with no pictures deleted at the zoo) plus the number of pictures she took at both places.

   Putting it all together:

   z-d=l (zoo)
   m=l (museum)
   
   Combining these equations and solving for l:

   l = m + z - d (total)
   
   Now that we know l, we can find both m and z separately:

   m = l - (z - d) (museum)
   
   z-d= m (zoo)
   
   Substituting l from step (4):

   m = (m + z - d) - (z - d) (museum)
   
   z-d= (m+z-d)-(z-d) (zoo)
   
   Simplifying this to eliminate redundancies:

   z = m+d (zoo)
   
   {The final answer is the value of z}.
   
   We then have m as well:

   m = 2(z-d) - z + d (museum)
   
   {The final answer is the value of m}.
   
   Combining our answers:

   l = 2(z-d) (total)
   
   Putting it all together:

   z-d=2(z-d)-z+d (total)
   
   Simplifying this further, we get:

   l = z (total)
   
   {The final answer is the value of l, equivalent to z}.
   
   So, the total number of pictures Haley still has from her vacation is the same as the number of pictures she took at the zoo.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here's the solution:

Our notation for calculating factorials is !. So, 5! represents the product of all positive integers from 5 down to 1.

First, we have 5! roses. If the florist sold 3 of them, she would be left with (5-3)! roses, which is 2! (i.e., 2 times 1). After selling these 3 roses, the florist would have 2! + 34 = 28 roses (i.e., 2 times 1, plus 34). So, at this point, she has 28 roses. We can represent this as:

5! -> 3 sold -> 2! + 34 = 28 roses

Let's call the number of roses she has now as x, so:

5! -> 3 sold -> x = 28

Letting x = y - 34, we get:

5! -> 3 sold -> y = x + 34 = 28 + 34 = 62

Therefore, the final number of roses (y) that she has after initially having 5!, is 62. The equation for this problem is:

5! -> 3 sold -> x = 28; x = y - 34; y = x + 34

Here's our step-by-step reasoning:

1. The florist has 5! roses. Call this number R (i.e., 5! = R).

2. She sells 3 of these roses (i.e., 5! - 3 = R - 3).

3. After selling these 3 roses, she is left with (5 - 3)! = 2! (i.e., R - 3) + 34. Call the remaining number of roses X.

4. Now, we want to find the total number of roses after picking 34 more. We'll use a new variable called Y (i.e., Y = X + 34).

5. Using the relation between R, X, and Y (i.e., R = 5!, X = R - 3, Y = X + 34), we get:

Y = X + 34
Y = (R - 3) + 34
Y = R - 3 + 34

Now, we just have to solve for R in terms of Y.

6. Solving this equation for R, we get:

R = Y - 34
Substituting this into our original equation (i.e., R = 5!), we get:

5! = Y - 34

Taking the factorial of 5 on both sides, our final answer is:

5! -> 3 sold -> x = 28; x = y - 34; y = x + 34

The florist ends up with Y = 62 roses.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's first consider how many total sodas Cody bought. We know he bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas, so the total number of sodas is:

4 regular sodas + 44 diet sodas = 48 sodas (total)

Next, we need to calculate how many shelves are needed to fit all of the regular sodas. Since each shelf can hold 6 regular sodas, and Cody bought 4, we can use division to determine the number of shelves needed:

4 regular sodas / 6 regular sodas per shelf = 2 shelves needed for regular sodas

We can now calculate how many shelves are needed to fit all of the diet sodas. Again, since each shelf can hold 6 diet sodas, and Cody bought 44, we can use division to determine the number of shelves needed:

44 diet sodas / 6 diet sodas per shelf = 7 shelves needed for diet sodas

As Cody's fridge can only hold 6 sodas per shelf, we need to subtract the number of regular and diet sodas we've already placed on shelves to determine how many more shelves we need to fit the remaining sodas. 

There are 2 shelves full of regular sodas, and 6 regular sodas on each shelf, for a total of 12 regular sodas. We also have 2 shelves worth of diet sodas, but we've already calculated that we need 7 shelves in total, so there are 5 shelves left over. We calculate the number of diet sodas that are on the remaining shelves:

5 shelves worth of diet sodas / 6 diet sodas per shelf = 30 diet sodas remaining

Including the 44 diet sodas we already placed, our total number of diet sodas is:

44 diet sodas + 30 diet sodas remaining = 74 diet sodas (total)

Subtracting the total number of diet sodas we have placed or remaining, we can calculate the number of regular sodas that remain:

48 total sodas (regular + diet) - 74 total diet sodas (already placed + remaining) - 12 regular sodas already placed = 32 regular sodas remaining

Finally, we need to determine how many additional shelves are necessary to accommodate these remaining regular sodas:

32 regular sodas remaining / 6 regular sodas per shelf = 6 additional shelves needed

Adding the 2 shelves full of regular sodas we've already placed, and the 6 additional shelves we need to fit the remaining sodas, we've determined the total number of shelves needed to store all of Cody's sodas:

2 shelves full of regular sodas + 6 additional shelves needed for remaining regular sodas = 8 total shelves needed

Now we can count how many shelves are still empty. Since we know Cody's fridge can only hold 6 sodas per shelf, and we've filled a total of 8 shelves, we can use subtraction to calculate the number of empty shelves:

8 total shelves filled / 6 sodas per shelf = 4 full shelves

8 total shelves filled - 4 full shelves = 4 empty shelves (when rounded down)

So, in summary, Cody would need to fill up 4 empty shelves to maximize the storage capacity of his fridge:

4 empty shelves + 8 total shelves filled = 12 total shelves filled

12 total shelves filled / 6 sodas per shelf = 2 shelves worth of remaining sodas

2 shelves worth of remaining sodas / 6 sodas per shelf = 12 remaining sodas

Therefore, we can say:

12 remaining sodas (from the 2 shelves worth of remaining sodas) + 48 total regular sodas (from the beginning of this problem) + 74 total diet sodas (from the beginning of this problem) = 132 total sodas

The final answer is:

Cody would need to fill up 12 empty shelves to maximize the storage capacity of his fridge, leaving a total of 132 sodas in the fridge.</s>",8,8.0,132.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Analyze the given information and identify the unknowns:
   - ? represents the name of the schools debate team.
   - ? represents the number of boys in the team.
   - ? and ! represent unknown quantities in steps 4 and 5, respectively.

2. Count the total number of students:
   - Based on the information provided, we know that there are 26 boys and 46 girls.
   - The total number of students is: 26 boys + 46 girls = 72 students.

3. Split the team into groups:
   - We don't have enough information to determine how many groups they could make.
   - We know that each group has 9 students (?split into groups ! of ? 9).
   - Let's create a variable x for the number of groups they could make.
   - Then, the number of students in each group will be 9.
   - Therefore, the total number of students in all groups will be: x groups of 9 students each = 9x students.

4. Check for consistency:
   - We know that they made ? groups.
   - Each group had 9 students.
   - The total number of students in all groups made is: ? groups of 9 students each = 9? students.
   - From our previous calculation, the total number of students in all groups should be 9x students.
   - Therefore, 9x = 9?.
   - Solving for x, we get: x = ?/?.

5. Find the number of groups they could make:
   - Since we cannot divide by 0, in step 4, we know that the number of groups they could make is an integer since x is an integer.
   - Therefore, there are no leftover students.
   - We can now substitute x = ?/?. From step 4 into x groups of 9 students each = 9x students.
   - The total number of students in all groups made is: 9(?/?) students.

6. Find the total number of students:
   - We have already found the total number of students in steps 1 and 3.
   - The total number of students should match the total number of students in all groups made.
   - Therefore, our initial calculation of the total number of students should also match the total number of students in all groups made.

7. Check the answer:
   - From step 5, we have ? = ? × ? = ? groups.
   - Since the students are divided into groups of 9, the number of students in each group will be 9.
   - Hence, the total number of students in all the groups will be: ? groups of 9 students each = 81 students.
   - This number of students is equal to the initial calculation of the total number of students.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is:
   The schools debate team, named ?, had a total of 72 students, including 26 boys and 46 girls. They could have made ? groups, with each group having 9 students. {The final answer is: ? = 8x/9, x is an integer}</s>",8,8.0,9.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of red apples ordered:
   - Number of red apples ordered for lunch = 6! red apples per student for lunch
   - Number of red apples ordered for breakfast = 0
   - Total number of red apples ordered = (6! red apples per student for lunch) (number of students who eat fruit for breakfast) + (6! red apples per student for lunch) (number of students who do not eat fruit for breakfast)
   - The formula for the number of red apples ordered for breakfast is 0 as no red apples are ordered for breakfast
   - Using the formula, we get:
     Total red apples ordered = (0) (x) + (6!) (24 - x)
     Total red apples ordered = 6! (24 - x)

2. Calculate the total number of green apples ordered:
   - Number of green apples ordered for lunch = 15; green apples per student for lunch
   - Number of green apples ordered for breakfast = 0
   - Total number of green apples ordered = (15; green apples per student for lunch) (number of students who eat fruit for breakfast) + (15; green apples per student for lunch) (number of students who do not eat fruit for breakfast)
   - The formula for the number of green apples ordered for breakfast is 0 as no green apples are ordered for breakfast
   - Using the formula, we get:
     Total green apples ordered = (0) (x) + (15) (24 - x)
     Total green apples ordered = 15 (24 - x)

3. Calculate the total number of apples ordered:
   - Total number of apples ordered = Total number of red apples ordered + Total number of green apples ordered
   - Using the equations we previously obtained, this is:
   - (6! (24 - x)) + (15) (24 - x)
   - (6! + 15) (24 - x)

4. Calculate the number of extra apples:
   - Let x represent the number of students who do not eat fruit for breakfast
   - Number of apples ordered for lunch = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples ordered for breakfast
   - Assuming that all students eat fruit for lunch, the number of apples ordered for breakfast is:
   - (6!) (x) + (15) (y)
   - Where y is the number of students who eat fruit for breakfast and y = 24 - x
   - So the total number of apples ordered for breakfast is:
   - (6!) (x) + (15) (24 - x)
   - The number of extra apples is calculated by finding the difference between the total number of apples ordered for lunch and the number of apples ordered for lunch when all students eat fruit for breakfast
   - Therefore, the number of extra apples is:
   - Total number of apples ordered for lunch - Number of apples ordered for lunch when all students eat fruit for lunch
   - Using our existing calculations for the number of red apples and green apples ordered, this looks like:
   - [((6! (24 - x)) + (15) (24 - x)) - ((6! x) + (15) (24))]
   - Expanding this equation out gives:
   - (6! - 6!) (x) + (6! + 15) (24) - (15) (24)
   - Simplifying this:
   - (6! - 15) (x) + (6! + 15) (4)
   - This simplifies to:
   - (6! - 15) (x) + 24 (6! + 15)
   - And now, we're ready to find our final answer!

The final answer for the number of extra apples is:

(6! - 15) (x) + 24 (6! + 15)

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the total number of people

We know that at the company picnic, there were 9 managers and 15 employees, for a total of 24 people.

Step 2: Decide the number of teams

The problem states that they split into 8 teams to play volleyball.

Step 3: Calculate the number of people on each team

If we divide the total number of people (24) by the number of teams (8), we can find out how many people should be on each team.

Number of people per team = Total number of people / Number of teams
     = 24 / 8
     = 3

So, each team will have 3 people playing volleyball, {The final answer is: Each team will have 3 people}.

Therefore, every team will have 3 managers and 3 employees, {The final answer is:} Each team will have 3 managers and 3 employees.

To summarize, if 9 managers and 15 employees split into 8 teams to play volleyball, each team will have a total of 6 people (3 managers and 3 employees), giving us {The final answer is:} Each team will have a total of 6 people (3 managers and 3 employees).</s>",3,3.0,3.0

<|assistant|>
Let's break this down step by step to clearly show each step of reasoning.

First, let's extract the necessary information from the problem. When the store had 4 books, there were three places to store them: A book! store, the bargain, and the bin. If the store sold 3 books from any of these locations, they still had 1 book left (4 - 3 = 1). Later, they put 10 more books in the bin (so they have a total of 10 books in the bin).

Now, let's fill in the blanks from the question.
?  ; A book ! store had 4 books in , the bargain , bin. : If , they sold 3 books, but then put 10 ; more ; in ; the bin, , how ! many : books would ? be in ? the , bin?

To calculate how many books will be in the bin, we first find out how many books the store has in total (after they put 10 more books in the bin). We know the store had 4 books before they put any more in the bin. After they put 10 more in the bin, the store will now have a total of 14 books (10 more than the original 4). Now we can fill in the blanks from the question:

?  ; A book ! store had 4 books in , the bargain , bin. : If they sold 3 books, how many books would there be in the bin?

Let's call the number of books in the bin ""x"". When the store sold 3 books, they went from having 14 books in total (10 in the bin and 4 elsewhere) to having 11 books in total. How many of those 11 books remain in the bin?

We can calculate that by finding the difference between the total number of books after the sale and the number of books they sold:

11 - 3 = 8 (number of books left in the store)

8 is the number of books that remain in the store (not in the bin), and ""x"" is the number of books in the bin. So, ""x"" must equal the difference between the original number of books they had in the bin (10) and the number of books they sold (3):

""x"" = 10 - 3 = 7

Now we can replace the question with our calculations:

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Mike earned $42 dollars mowing lawns over the summer (written as 42 dollars or $42).
2. We know that Mike spent $10 dollars on new mower blades.
3. Our goal is to find out how many $0.80 games Mike could buy with the money he had left after earning $42 and spending $10 on new mower blades.
4. First, we need to find out how much money Mike has left after earning $42 and spending $10 on new mower blades (let's call that amount ""x"").
5. To find ""x,"" we can create an equation by setting the amount earned ($42) equal to the amount spent ($10) on new mower blades plus the amount left over (""x"").
6. This can be written as an equation: $42 = $10 + x$
7. Let's solve for ""x"" by subtracting $10 from both sides of the equation.
8. $42 - $10 = $10 + x - $10$
9. $32 = x$
10. So, Mike has $32 left after earning $42 and spending $10 on new mower blades.
11. Now, let's find out how many $0.80 games Mike could buy with $32 using the information we have.
12. To do this, we simply divide $32 by $0.80, the cost of one game (round down if necessary).
13. $32 \div$ 0.80 = 40 games
14. So, Mike could buy 40 games with the money he has left after earning $42 and spending $10 on new mower blades.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we use basic algebraic operations and the given information.

Let x be the number of potatoes the chef has already cooked. The chef still needs to cook 13-x potatoes to reach the total target of 13.

The time taken to cook each potato is 6 minutes.

Using this information, we can set up two equations to represent the situation:

1. The number of potatoes already cooked, x, plus the number of potatoes still needed to be cooked, 13-x, is equal to the total number of potatoes needed, 13.

   x + 13 - x = 13

   Simplifying, x = 0 or x = 13. Since we know the chef hasn't already cooked all 13 potatoes, x is not 13. Therefore,

   x = 0

   This means the chef hasn't cooked any potatoes yet.

2. The time taken to cook the total number of potatoes, 13, is the sum of the time taken to cook the potatoes that have already been cooked (0 minutes) and the time taken to cook the potatoes that still need to be cooked.

   (Number of potatoes already cooked) * (Time taken to cook each potato) + (Number of potatoes still needed to be cooked) * (Time taken to cook each potato) = (Total number of potatoes to be cooked) * (Time taken to cook each potato)

   We can express this in terms of x.

   0 * 6 + (13-x) * 6 = 13 * 6

   Simplifying, 13 * 6 = 13 * 6, since we know x = 0.

   To find the time taken to cook the remaining 13 potatoes, we split them into two parts: the potatoes that have already been cooked and the remaining uncookooked potatoes.

   We can find the number of potatoes that have already been cooked using the first equation:

   x = 0

   From here, we can find the number of remaining uncookoked potatoes:

   13 - x = 13 - 0 = 13

   The time taken to cook the potatoes that have already been cooked is 0 minutes.

   The time taken to cook the remaining uncooked potatoes is (Number of remaining uncooked potatoes) * (Time taken to cook each potato):

   (13) * 6 = 78 minutes

   Total time taken to cook all the potatoes = Time taken to cook the potatoes already cooked + Time taken to cook the remaining uncooked potatoes:

   0 + 78 = 78 minutes

   {The final answer is 78 minutes.}

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's first break it down into smaller parts and analyze them.

Paige had 43 math problems and 12! science problems for a total of (43 + 12!) math and science problems. This means she had (43 + 12!) problems in total.

At school, Paige finished 44: of the math problems, where : represents an unknown number of math problems. This means she finished a total of (44 + :) math problems at school.

Now, let's find out how many problems Paige had to do for homework. This would be the remaining number of problems she has to complete at home.

Starting with the number of problems she finished at school, we have:

(43 + 12!) - (44 + :) = Number of problems for homework

Expanding the formula (12!) we get:

(43 + 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) - (44 + :) = Number of problems for homework

Now, let's simplify:

12(11! - (44 + :))/ (43 + :) = Number of problems for homework

Let's call the number of problems for homework x.

x = 12(11! - (44 + :))/ (43 + :)

Finally, replacing the symbol : with its real value, we have:

x = 12(11! - (44 - 44:))/ (43 + (44 - 44:))

This simplifies to:

x = 12(11!)/ (43 + 44)

Hence, the expression:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's first define each variable:

? = type of discount (either percentage or dollar amount)
? = presence of a sale (either yes or no)
? = price of each flower (dollars)
x = number of roses bought by April
y = number of daisies bought by April
z = number of roses bought by Vanessa
a = number of daisies bought by Vanessa

April's discount: We don't know if it's a percentage or dollar amount, so we'll use the ? to represent this until we have more information.

sale: We also don't know if there's a sale or not, so we'll use ? again until we have more information.

price of each flower: We do know the price of each flower, so we can enter a definite value for this. Let's say $2 for each rose and $1 for each daisy.

Now that we have defined our variables, let's work through the steps:

1. April's discount: Without knowing whether the discount is a percentage or dollar amount, we can't tell how much April saved with her discount. We'll have to come back to this variable and either define a specific number or figure out how to calculate the discount based on the type of discount.

2. Sale: Again, without knowing if there's a sale or not, we can't calculate the discount. Let's assume for now that there's no sale (but we'll have to come back to this variable, too).

3. Price of each flower: This is what we know for sure, and we've entered those values under the appropriate variables.

4. Number of roses and daisies bought by April: We're given the number of roses and daisies bought by Vanessa, but not by April. Let's assume for now that she bought 0 (this will turn out to be wrong, but it helps us work through the problem).

5. Number of roses and daisies bought by Vanessa: We're given the specific numbers: Vanessa bought 3 roses and 3 daisies.

6. April's total cost: We don't know how much April paid because we don't know whether she got a discount or whether there was a sale. We'll come back to this variable to work through the discount and calculate her total cost.

7. Vanessa's total cost: We can calculate this by adding up the cost of the flowers she bought:

8 roses at $2 each: $16
3 daisies at $1 each: $3

Total cost for Vanessa: $19

To summarize, here's what we know so far:

April's discount: ? (unresolved)
sale: ? (unresolved)
price of each flower: $2 for each rose, $1 for each daisy
number of roses and daisies bought by April: 0 (unresolved)
number of roses and daisies bought by Vanessa: 3 roses, 3 daisies
April's total cost: ? (unresolved)
Vanessa's total cost: $19

Now we'll go back to our unresolved variables (April's discount and sale) and re-evaluate.

April's discount: We can assume that the discount is a dollar amount, because we were given a specific dollar figure: April spent $8 on her flowers. If we assume that this $8 was discounted, it could be possible that her total bill without the discount was $16. That would fit with $16 as the price for 8 roses.

sale: At this point, we know that April did not get a discount based on the number of flowers she bought (otherwise there would be no mention of it). However, we don't know whether the sale covered all flowers, or just some of them. We'll assume for now that there was no sale (but we'll still come back to this).

April's total cost: If April got a discount, her total cost would be less than the price of all her flowers. Let's say that her total price (before discount) was $20. After the discount of $8, April paid $12 for her flowers:

8 roses at $2 each: $16

To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps:

1. Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 pictures from her camera to Facebook.

2. She sorted the pictures into 8 different albums, with the same amount of pictures in each album.

3. Let's call the number of pictures in each album x.

4. We know that the total number of pictures uploaded from the camera is 35x, because there are x pictures in each album, and she has 8 albums.

5. Adding in the 5 pictures uploaded from her phone, we can find the total number of pictures uploaded:

   Total number of pictures uploaded = 35x + 5

6. We also know that Olivia had more pictures on her camera than on her phone. This means that the number of pictures on her camera is greater than the number of pictures on her phone. Let's call the number of pictures on her camera y, and the number of pictures on her phone p.

7. Since we know y is greater than p, we can set up the following equation:

   y > p (inequality)

8. From step 1, we know that y is equal to 35x, and p is equal to 5:

   y = 35x (equality)
   p = 5 (equality)

9. Substituting y and p into the inequality from step 6, we have:

   35x > 5

10. Dividing both sides of the inequality by x, we get:

   $35 \geq \frac{5}{x}$ (inequality)

11. Since x is a positive number, we can take the reciprocal of both sides of the inequality from step 10:

   $x \leq \frac{5}{35}$ (inequality)

12. From steps 5 and 11, we can find the limits of x:

   35x + 5 <= 35x + 5 (inequality)
   $x \leq \frac{5}{35}$ (inequality)

13. This gives us the equation:

   35x + 5 = 35x + 5 (equality)

14. From step 3, we know that x is the number of pictures in each album. Since we know the maximum and minimum number of pictures in each album, we can set up equations to find the values of x:

   First, consider x = 15 (integer). In this case, we can find the total number of pictures:

   Total number of pictures = 35 * 15 + 5
   Total number of pictures = 525

   This is too large, because we know from step 1 that the total number of pictures uploaded cannot be greater than the number of pictures that Olivia had in total.

15. To make sure the total number of pictures is not larger than the number of pictures Olivia had in total, we should decrement the value of x. Try x = 10 (integer).

   Total number of pictures = 35 * 10 + 5
   Total number of pictures = 370

   This is less than or equal to the number of pictures that Olivia had in total, so it's possible for x to be 10. Also, since we know that each album has the same number of pictures, 10 is the number of pictures in each album.

16. Therefore, the final answer is:

   The final answer is: Each album has 10 pictures. {The final answer is}</s>",5,5.0,10.0

3. We know that Robin is making baggies with cookies. Her bags can hold 6 cookies, both chocolate chip and oatmeal.

4. Let's assume Robin is making baggies containing only chocolate chip cookies.

5. We can find out how many chocolate chip cookies she can put in each baggie by dividing the number of chocolate chip cookies she has by the number of bags she can make.

   - The number of chocolate chip cookies in each baggie is:

       23 chocolate chip cookies ÷ Number of baggies

   - Let's call the number of baggies Robin can make ""x"".

   - Substitute ""x"" in our formula:

   - Cross-multiply:

       23x = 138 chocolate chip cookies

6. Now we know that Robin is making baggies with both chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies. Let's calculate how many baggies she can make with just chocolate chip cookies. Call the number of baggies ""x1"".

   - The number of chocolate chip cookies Robinson can put in each baggie is:

   - The number of oatmeal cookies in each baggie is:

       25 oatmeal cookies ÷ Number of baggies

   - Let's call the number of baggies ""x2"".

   - Simplify our expression:

       25 oatmeal cookies ÷ x2 = y oatmeal cookies per baggie

8. Now we know how many chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies are in each baggie. Let's calculate how many baggies Robin can make with both types of cookies. Call the number of baggies ""x3"".

   - The number of chocolate chip cookies in each baggie is:

       23 chocolate chip cookies ÷ x3

   - The number of oatmeal cookies in each baggie is:

       25 oatmeal cookies ÷ x3 = y oatmeal cookies per baggie

9. We know that Robin is making baggies with 6 cookies in each bag. To find out how many total cookies she can put in each baggie, we need to add the number of chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies.

10. Let's find out how many chocolate chip cookies Robin can make with all the ingredients she has. Call the number of baggies ""x4"".

   - The number of chocolate chip cookies Robinson can make with just chocolate chip cookies is ""x1"".

   - The number of chocolate chip cookies Robinson can make with both types of cookies is (x3 * 6 chocolate chip cookies per baggie).

11. Now we can find the total number of oatmeal cookies she can make by adding the oatmeal cookies she's already made (""x2 * y oatmeal cookies per baggie"") to the oatmeal cookies she'll make when she makes baggies with both chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies (""x3 * y oatmeal cookies per baggie"").

12. Let's find out how many baggies Robin should make with both types of cookies so she can finish all the ingredients she has (""x3"").

<|assistant|>
Step 1: Analyze the information given

First, let's break down the problem into its component parts:

- Wendy uploaded a total of 22 pictures from her phone and 2 pictures from her camera to Facebook.
- These pictures were then sorted into 4 different albums with the same number of pictures in each album.

We're being asked to find out how many pictures were in each album.

Step 2: Identify unknowns and relationships

Unknowns:
- We don't know how many pictures were in each album. Let's call this number x.

Relationships:
- We know the total number of pictures uploaded is 22 from the phone and 2 from the camera, which adds up to 24 pictures in total.
- Each album has the same number of pictures, so if there are 4 albums, the total number of pictures in all 4 albums is 4x.
- We also know that 22 pictures from the phone and 2 pictures from the camera were distributed among the 4 albums, so we can break this down further:
  - Each album gets an equal share of the 22 pictures from the phone, so x/4 of the pictures from the phone go into each album.
  - Each album gets 1 of the pictures from the camera, so each album has 1 picture from the camera.
  - Combining these two parts, the number of pictures in each album is:
    
    x from each album containing an equal number of pictures from the phone
    + 1 picture from the camera in each album
    
    x + 1 = total number of pictures per album

Step 3: Substitute values and solve

We can now substitute in our relationships and unknowns to simplify the equation and find a solution:

- Let's call the total number of pictures uploaded 24.
- We're looking for the number of pictures that go into each album, which we're calling x.

- We know each album contains some portion of the 22 phone pictures, x/4.
- Each album also contains 1 picture from the camera, so each album has a total of x/4 + 1 picture.

- In other words, there are 4x/4 or x pictures from the phone and 4 pictures from the camera, for a total of 4x + 4 pictures per album.

- But we know the total number of pictures in an album is 24, so we have 24 = 4x + 4.

- Simplifying this equation gives us x = 6, meaning that each album contains 6 pictures from the phone and 1 picture from the camera.

- Therefore, the number of pictures in each of the 4 albums is 24, and each album contains 7 pictures in total (6 from the phone and 1 from the camera).

- The final answer is: Each album contains 7 pictures in total.

{The final answer is: Each album contains 7 pictures in total.}</s>",6,6.0,7.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations using the information given. First, let x represent the number of candies Katie's sister has. Then, we know that Katie had 8 pieces of candy and her sister had x pieces of candy on Halloween. After eating 8 pieces the first night, they were left with a total of c candies (where we don't know the value of c yet).

Let y represent the number of candies they have left (after eating 8 candies from the total of c candies).

We can write the first equation as follows:

8 = 8 (for Katie) + (x - 8) (for sister after eating 8 candies)

Or, more explicitly:

8 = 8 (for Katie) + x - 8 (for sister after eating 8 candies)

Simplifying, we get:

x - 8 = 0

Next, we know that they had a total of (8 + x) candies, and after eating a total of 8 candies, they had c candies left. Let z be the number of candies remaining after the second night. Then, we can write the second equation as follows:

(8 + x) - 8 = c

Or, more explicitly:

8 + x - 8 = c

Simplifying, we get:

x = c

Now, we have two equations with two unknowns (x and c). We can substitute the value of x from the first equation into the second equation to eliminate x:

(8 + c) - 8 = c

Simplifying, we get:

c = 8

So, Katie and her sister had a total of 8 candies left after the second night.

To find the number of candies they had originally, we go back to the first equation with x no longer representing Katie's sister's initial number of candies:

8 = 8 (for Katie) + (c - 8) (for sister after eating 8 candies)

Or, more explicitly:

8 = 8 (for Katie) + c - 8 (for sister after eating 8 candies)

Simplifying, we get:

c = x = 23

So, Katie originally had 8 candies, and her sister had 23 candies.

Now we use our value for c to find the number of candies they have left (after eating 8 candies):

y = 8 + 23 = 31

Therefore, Katie and her sister have 31 candies left.

To sum it up, we got the original number of candies Katie's sister started with by substituting c = x = 23 into our first equation. We then found the number of candies they have left by solving the second equation, using our value for c. 

{The final answer is: After eating 8 candies from a total of 31, Katie and her sister have 31 candies left. Katie originally had 8 candies, and her sister had 23 candies at the start of the problem.}</s>",23,23.0,23.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we will use the following steps:

1. Understand the given information:
- There were ! 88 puppies in the store (exclamation mark denotes that the number is large).
- They sold 34 puppies in one day.
- They put some of the remaining puppies into cages (we are not given how many puppies were put into cages).
- Each cage contained 6 puppies (we are not given how many cages were used).

2. Determine the number of puppies left after selling 34:
- Initially, there were ! 88 puppies.
- They sold 34 puppies.
- The number left is ! (88 - 34) = ! 54.

3. Calculate the number of cages used:
- Each cage contained 6 puppies.
- The number of puppies left was ! 54.
- The number of cages required is the quotient of the remaining puppies and the number of puppies in each cage:
  - ! 54 / 6 = ! 9 as an integer, but our answer should be exact, so let's instead say ! 9 + 6 is needed to house the remaining puppies.

4. Put it all together:
- Initially, they had ! 88 puppies.
- They sold 34 puppies.
- They used ! 9 cages to house the remaining puppies, with each cage containing 6 puppies.
- The total number of puppies now sold is 34 + (6 times the number of cages used):
    - 34 + 6 (! 9) = 444 (this is impossible as ! 9 is a non-integer).
    - Adjust the remaining puppies: ! (9 - 1) = ! 8 (the ""-1"" to make the final solution with remaining puppies exact, so let's instead say it's ! 9 + 6 = ! 14).
- The total number of puppies sold is 34 + (6 times the number of cages used):
    - 34 + 6 (! 14) = ! 96.

So, the final answer is that they sold ! 96 puppies in total.</s>",9,9.0,96.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller, step-by-step calculations. Let's start with finding out how many trays Jerry can carry at a time. This is given to us as 8.

Next, let's find out how many trays Jerry needs to pick up in total from both tables. This is a combination of 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from the other table. Let's calculate this using addition:

9 trays from one table + 7 trays from the other table = 16 trays in total

Now that we know how many trays Jerry needs to pick up in total, we can calculate how many trips he will need to make. We can find this by dividing the total number of trays by the number of trays Jerry can carry in one trip:

Total number of trays / Number of trays Jerry can carry in one trip = Number of trips Jerry needs to make

Let's substitute the values we have into the formula:

16 trays / 8 trays per trip = 2 trips

Therefore, Jerry needs to make 2 trips to pick up all 16 trays.

To summarize, the final answer is: Jerry needs to make 2 trips to pick up all 16 trays; the final answer is 2.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations to represent the situation. Here are the steps:

1. First, let's define the variables:
   - x = number of points scored per treasure
   - y = number of treasures found on the first level
   - z = number of treasures found on the second level
   - p = total number of points scored

2. We're given the following information:
   - Faye scores 7x points for each treasure
   - X, y, and z are unknowns
   - She finds y treasures on the first level and z treasures on the second level

3. Calculate the points scored on the first level:
   - 7x * y = points scored on the first level

4. Calculate the points scored on the second level:
   - 7x * z = points scored on the second level

5. Find the total number of points scored:
   - Add the points scored on the first level and the points scored on the second level
   - p = points scored on the first level + points scored on the second level
   - Substituting our equations from steps 3 and 4:
   - p = 7x * y + 7x * z

6. Simplify this equation:
   - Factor out the x:
   - p = 7x (y + z)

7. Define the given information:
   - Faye ! scores 7 ! points for each treasure
   - ! denotes that we're unsure if Faye scores a certain number of points
   - Let's define y', z', and p' as the unknown number of points scored when Faye scores the 7x points per treasure
   - y', z', and p' are all unknown

8. Calculate the points scored on the first level:
   - 7x' * y' = points scored on the first level

9. Calculate the points scored on the second level:
   - 7x' * z' = points scored on the second level

10. Find the total number of points scored:
   - p' = points scored on the first level + points scored on the second level
   - Using steps 8 and 9:
   - p' = 7x' * y' + 7x' * z'

11. Use our original system of equations to simplify this equation:
   - p' = 7x' (y' + z')

12. Compare the two systems of equations. To find out how many points Faye scores in the game, there are two possibilities:
   - If Faye scores 7 points per treasure, then p = 7x (y + z), and p' = 7x' (y' + z')
   - If Faye scores a different number of points per treasure, we can find a formula for how many points she scores by combining the two systems:
   - Let's define a as the number of points that Faye scores per treasure (x = as)
   - Then:
   - p = 7a (y + z), and p' = a (y' + z')
   - To find out how many points Faye scores, divide the number of points scored in the second scenario (p') by the number of points scored in the first scenario (p)
   - {The final answer is}:
   - Faye scores (p' / p) times more points when she scores a different number of points per treasure

13. Solve for Faye's score when she scores a different number of points than 7 per treasure:
   - (p' / p) = (a (y' + z') / 7a (y + z))
   - This is an expression that depends on the unknown variables a, y', z', y, and z.
   - To make progress, let's assume that Faye finds the same number of treasures on both levels (i.e., y = z).
   - Simplifying:
   - (p' / p) = (a y' / 7y)
   - Let's plug in some numbers to see whether a pattern emerges:
   - If y' = 1 (i.e., Faye finds 1 treasure on the first level):
   - (p' / p) = (a / 7)
   - If y' = 2 (",56,56.0,2.0

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the number of files Wendy had initially.
   Wendy had 82 files on her computer.

2. Find the number of files Wendy deleted.
   Wendy deleted ? 37 : of ? files.
   Since the symbols ? and ? indicate unknown quantities, it's unclear how many files Wendy deleted. We need more information.

3. Find the number of files Wendy put into folders.
   After deleting some files, Wendy put the remaining files into folders. We can't find the number of files she put into folders, but we do know that each folder has 5 files.
   Let's say there are x folders.
   Then, the number of files in folders is 5x.

4. Find the total number of files after placing them into folders.
   The total number of files is the sum of the files Wendy had initially, minus the files she deleted, plus the files she put into folders.
   Total number of files = Initial number of files - Number of files deleted + Number of files in folders
   For Wendy's case:
   Total number of files = 82 - x + 5x

5. Simplify the equation from step 4.
   Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:
   82 = 5x - x
   x can't be negative, so the value of x is a multiple of -5. However, we can't divide by -5, so we must re-evaluate the problem with different unknowns.

6. Try again with different unknowns.
   Let's assume that x is the total number of folders, and y is the number of files Wendy deleted. Then, the number of files in each folder is y divided by 5.
   Following the same process from step 4:
   Total number of files = Initial number of files - Number of files deleted + Number of files in folders
   Total number of files = 82 - y + y / 5 x

7. Simplify the equation from step 6.
   For convenience's sake, let's call the number of folders q.
   Total number of files = 82 - y + y / 5 q

8. Simplify the equation from step 7.
   To simplify the expression, multiply both sides by 5, and replace y / 5 with z.
   5(82 - y + z) = 5x
   Simplify the left-hand side, and let y = -37:
   410 - 5y + 5z = 5x

9. Solve for x.
   Using the formula for system of linear equations, we can find out how many folders Wendy has.
   Following similar steps:
   410 - 5y + 5z = 5x
   - Find the value of the coefficient of the x term, which is 5. To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5.
   - Find the value of the constant term, which is -410. The -y term affects the value of x, so we'll combine the y and z terms into a single term.
   - We do this by finding the value of y in terms of z:
   - Substitute the expression for y in the original equation:
   82 - (-37) + z = xq
   - We want the number of folders, so let's find the value of x:
   - Split the left-hand side of the equation in terms of q and x, and set both sides equal:
   410 - 370 + 5z = 5x
   - Set up the equation for x, and solve for it:
   - x = (410 - 370) / (5 - 5/q) = (820/q)

10. Find the number of folders Wendy ended up with.
   Replacing x with the expression we found for x:
   x = (820/q)
   Let the value of q be the number of folders Wendy eventually ended up with.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent each statement as an equation and then solve for the unknown variable. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. First, let's represent Will's earnings from mowing lawns as W and the number of dollars he spent on blades for his mower as B. Since B is spent on new blades, we can say that his total number of spent dollars since the beginning of the summer (including both the blades and lawn mowing) is the sum of W and B. Let's represent this as D:

D = W + B

2. Next, Will also spent $41 on buying new blades. Let's represent this as S:

S = 41

3. We know that W is the number of dollars that Will earned by mowing lawns. Divide W by the number of dollars earned per lawn (let's call it L) and we get the number of lawns mowed so far. Let's represent this as M:

W = M * L

4. Now, we know that Will bought K nine-dollar games with the money he had left. His total money earned this summer (E) minus the cost of all his expenses (D + B + S) gives us his remaining balance (let's call it R):

E - (D + B + S) = R

Let's represent the number of games bought as K:

R = 9 * K

5. Finally, put all our equations together to find the unknown variables. We can substitute any equation into another one, so let's start by putting E in terms of W (our previous equation and the DFE technique). We also know that L is the number of dollars earned per lawn and M is the number of lawns mowed. Let's represent this as LM:

L * LM = W

6. Now, substitute our equations for W, D, B, and S into the original equation representing Will's total earned this summer:

E = W + B

7. Substitute W from step 5 and our equations for D, B, and S into this equation:

E = L * LM + S

8. Let's now find the number of games (K) that Will could have bought with his remaining balance (R). Divide K by 9 (the cost per game) and we get K/9 games:

K/9 = R/9

9. We can find out K by multiplying both sides of the equation from step 8 by 9:

K = 9 * R/9

10. To finish off, let's substitute our equation for R in the final step into our final equation for K. Then substitute our entire solution into our equation from step 7 for E:

E = L * LM + S + 9 * (E - (L * LM + B + S)) / 9

11. Let's rearrange the terms so we can find L:

E * 1/10 = (L * LM + B + S) / 9

12. Finally, let's solve for L inside the parentheses. Then, use this solved L in LM:

L = (E/10 - B/9 - S/9) / M

13. At the end, let's put all our answers together as our final solution:

The final answer is:

- L: The number of dollars earned per lawn (L)
- M: The number of lawns mowed (M)
- W: The total number of dollars earned this summer (W)

Let x represent the total number of carrots Nancy has after picking 21 more carrots on the second day.

On the first day, Nancy picked 12 carrots. Let y represent the number of carrots she threw away. We can write this as an equation:

12 = 12 - y

Since we know she threw away 2 of them, we can substitute this into the equation above:

12 = 10 (12 - 2)

Expanding the expression inside the parentheses:

12 = 10(10 - 1)

Subtracting 10y from both sides:

12 - 10y = 100

Dividing both sides by 10:

(12 - y) = 10

Substituting 10 back into the equation from the first day:

10 = 10 - y

We can also write the second day's events as an equation:

x = 21 + y

Combining these two equations and solving for x:

10 = 10 - y

x = 21 + y

10 = 10 - y

Substituting the expression for y:

10 = 10 - (10 - x)

Expanding:

10 = 10 - 10 + x

Simplifying:

10 = x

Adding x to both sides:

10 + x = x + x

Simplifying:

20 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

10 = x

So the final answer is: 

{The final answer is 10.}

Thus, after picking 21 more carrots on the second day, Nancy would have a total of 10 carrots.</s>",31,31.0,10.0

<|assistant|>
Step 1: Identify the variables and their meanings
- Roger had x dollars before his 16th birthday
- Roger received y dollars for his birthday
- Roger received z dollars in total after his birthday (x + y)
- There are 28 exclamation points in this problem for emphasis, but they do not represent any variable value

Step 2: Solve for y, the amount Roger received for his birthday
- We are given that Roger had x dollars before his birthday and x + y dollars after his birthday (z)
- We also know that y is the amount he received for his birthday
- Create an equation to find the value of y
- z = x + y
- y = z - x
- Plug Roger's information into the equation: y = z - x
- Substitute for z using Roger's total amount of money: y = (x + 16) - x
- Evaluate: y = 16

Step 3: Find the total amount Roger has after getting more dollars
- We know that Roger received 28 more dollars after his birthday
- Let's call this new amount w
- To find w, we sum Roger's total after his birthday (z) and the additional 28 dollars: w = z + 28
- After plugging in Roger's total amount from Step 2, this becomes: w = (x + 16) + 28

Step 4: Find out how much Roger spent on a new game
- Let's call this amount g
- After purchasing the game, Roger has w - g dollars remaining
- Plugging in w and g, the remaining amount becomes: (x + 44) - g

Step 5: Evaluate the remaining amount for Roger
- This is how much he has now, after getting more dollars and then spending some on a new game
- To find this value, we'll rewrite the remaining amount from Step 4 in terms of g and then w, which we've already found in Steps 2 and 3
- First, substitute the w value from Step 3: (x + 44) - g = ((x + 16) + 28) - g
- Then, combine like terms and simplify: (x + 16) - g = (x + 44) - g
- Since the value of g cancels out, we're left with (x + 16): ! he , has ; now?

The final answer is (x + 16).

{The final answer is} (x + 16) dollars, where x is the number of dollars Roger had before his 16th birthday.</s>",19,19.0,16.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps to better understand the process.

1. On Saturday, Sam filled 3 bags with cans. Each bag contained an unknown number of cans, represented by the variable !. If we assume that Sam did not fill up all the bags completely, meaning not all ! bags had 9 cans, then we don't know the exact number of cans in each bag. However, we do know that he filled up 3 bags on Saturday.

2. On Sunday, Sam filled 4 bags with cans. Again, we don't know the exact number of cans in each bag.

3. Let's assign a value to !. We can call it x. Therefore, on Saturday, Sam filled x, x, and x bags with x, x, and x cans, respectively. On Sunday, he filled y, y, y, and y bags with y, y, y, and y cans, respectively.

4. To find the total number of cans Sam picked up, we need to add up the number of cans he collected on both days. To do this, we can use a table to better organize our data.

| Day | Number of Bags | Number of Cans in Each Bag | Total Number of Cans Collected |
| | | | |
| Saturday | x | x | x | x |
| Sunday | y | y | y | y |
| Total | 3 | 4 | 3x + 4y |

5. We can use the variables x and y to find the exact number of cans Sam picked up on each day. This is shown below:

| Day | Number of Bags | Number of Cans in Each Bag | Total Number of Cans Collected |
| | | | |
| Saturday | x | 9 | 9x |
| Sunday | y | 9 | 9y |
| Total | 3 | 9 | 27 + 36y |

6. Comparing the results from steps 4 and 5, we can see that the number of cans Sam collected on each day is equal between the tables.

| Day | Number of Bags | Number of Cans in Each Bag | Total Number of Cans Collected |
| | | | |
| Saturday | x | 9 | 9x |
| Sunday | y | 9 | 9y |
| Total | 3 | 9 | 27 + 36y |

7. Solving for x and y in step 6 gives us:

| Day | Number of Bags | Number of Cans in Each Bag | Total Number of Cans Collected |
| | | | |
| Saturday | ? | 9 | ? |
| Sunday | ? | 9 | 9*? |
| Total | 3 | 9 | 27 + 36 * ? |

8. From step 7, we can simplify the equation in the last row of the table to find the total number of cans Sam collected from both days:

| Day | Number of Bags | Number of Cans in Each Bag | Total Number of Cans Collected |
| | | | |
| Saturday | ? | 9 | ? |
| Sunday | ? | 9 | 9*? |
| Total | 3 | 9 | ? = 27 + 36 * ? |

9. Now, we can solve for the unknowns using the system of equations below:

| Day | Number of Bags | Number of Cans in Each Bag | Total Number of Cans Collected |
| | | | |
| Saturday | x | 9 | 9x |
| Sunday | y | 9 | 9y |
| Total | 3 | 9 | 27 + 36y |

x:                       y:                       Total:
9x = ? (row 1, column 4)         9y = ? (row 2, column 4)   27 + 36y = ? (row 3, column 4)

We can solve this system of equations for x, y, and the total number of cans using a method like Cramer's Rule or Gaussian Elimination.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, let x represent the number of questions (unknown) in each of the 4 worksheets.

2. The total number of questions on the worksheets can be found by multiplying the number of questions in each worksheet by the number of worksheets.

   Total number of questions = x * 4

3. We know that the teacher has already graded a certain number of questions, and we can find this value by multiplying the number of questions in each worksheet by the number of worksheets the teacher has already graded.

   Number of questions graded = x * 4 * 8

4. We also know that the teacher graded 16 worksheets, so we can find the number of questions in each of those 16 worksheets.

   Number of questions in each of the graded worksheets = x * 16

5. The total number of questions the teacher has graded is the number of questions in each of the graded worksheets multiplied by the number of graded worksheets.

   Number of questions graded = x * 16 * 8

6. Using what we know, we can create an equation to find the number of questions left to grade (let's call that x1).

   x * 4 - (x * 16 * 8) = x1

   Simplifying this equation, we get:

   x1 = x (4 - 128)

   Solving for x1, we get:

   x1 = -124x

   Since x1 should be a positive number, there is no solution for this equation.

   Thus, we can conclude that the teacher has graded all the questions, and there are no more left to grade.

   {The final answer is: The teacher has graded all the questions, and there are no more left to grade.}

Note: This is a simplified worksheet works out, as there is clearly an error in the original prompt. This prompt asks how many more problems the teacher has to grade, but the total number of questions does not add up to the sum of questions graded and questions yet to grade. The original prompt is therefore impossible to solve as presented, as the final result would be a negative value. While we could adjust the prompt to make it workable, this example illustrates how to work with basic algebra concepts and interpret the results.</s>",32,32.0,1.0

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Paige had some of her old winter clothes. (We don't know how many specifically, for now.)
2. She found 6 boxes of clothing. (Again, we don't know how many pieces were in each box yet.)
3. Inside each box, there were 5 scarves and 5 mittens, for a total of 10 winter clothing items in each box.
4. So, let's set up our equation to find the total number of winter clothing items that Paige has, after she discovered all 6 boxes:
   - 6 boxes found (let's call this x)
   - 10 winter clothing items in each box (let's call this y)
   - Total number of winter clothing items found = x * y
5. Let's replace the variables in the equation above with these definitions:
   - x is the number of boxes found by Paige
   - y is the number of winter clothing items found inside each box
   - Let's solve for the total number of winter clothing items found:
     Total number of winter clothing items found = x * y
     Total number of winter clothing items found = 6 * 10
     Total number of winter clothing items found = 60

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps and work through each one using logic and reasoning. Here's how:

1. We are given that a chef needs to cook 12 potatoes. Let's represent this as 12 potatoes to be cooked, or 12 x.

2. We are also given that the chef has already cooked 6 potatoes. Let's call this 6 x.

3. We know that each potato takes 6 minutes to cook. If we represent this as x minutes, we can set up an equation to find out how many minutes it takes to cook one potato:

   x = 6 (minutes per potato)

4. To find out how long it will take the chef to cook the rest of the potatoes, we need to calculate how many potatoes are left to be cooked. Since we know how many potatoes have been cooked already (6), we can find the number of potatoes that are still left to be cooked by subtracting the number that have already been cooked:

   12 total potatoes - 6 already cooked = 6 potatoes remaining to be cooked

   Let's call this 6 y.

5. Using what we know about the number of potatoes left to be cooked, we can set up another equation to find out how long it will take to cook the remaining potatoes. Since each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, and there are 6 y potatoes left, we get:

   6 y = 6 y x (minutes)

   6 y = 6 y (minutes per potato)

   6 y = y minutes (for all 6 y potatoes)

6. Combining our two equations, we get:

   x = 6 (minutes per potato)

   6 y = y minutes

   Substituting in our equation for x, we get:

   6 y = 6 y (minutes per potato)

   Solving for y, we get:

   y = x

   Substituting y back into our equation for the remaining time, we get:

   6 x = x minutes

   6 (12 - 6) = (12 - 6) x

   6 = x/2 minutes (per remaining potato)

   This means that for our given scenario, one remaining potato takes 6 minutes/2, or 3 minutes, to cook. Using this information, we can find out how long it will take to cook the remaining potatoes:

   3 y minutes

7. Combining this with the time it took to cook the first 6 potatoes, we get the total time it takes to cook all 12 potatoes:

   6 x + 3 y minutes

   12 x minutes

   Now here's a trick to make the calculation simpler: since x and y are measured in minutes and multiplying is easier than adding, we can find the total time it takes to cook all 12 potatoes by multiplying the number of potatoes multiplied by the minutes it takes to cook each potato:

   12 x minutes per potato = 12 x minutes to cook all 12 potatoes

   We're done! If we look at our initial equations, we see that each potato takes the same number of minutes to cook (x), regardless of whether it's one of the first 6 or one of the last 6. This means that we can replace x with y in our equation for the remaining time, and we can replace y with x in our equation for the remaining time. In other words, we can simplify our calculation and find the total number of minutes it takes to cook 12 potatoes as follows:

   12 x minutes

   And there you have it: a methodical step-by-step approach to solving word problems involving arithmetic, algebra, and logic. The final answer is 12 x minutes. Happy cooking, Chef!</s>",36,36.0,12.0

To solve this complex word problem, let's break it down into simpler parts and work through each step systematically.

1. original number of games = 57
2. number of games sold = 39
3. games left after selling = original number of games - number of games sold = 57 - 39 = 18
4. each box holds ! 2 games. Let's find the number of games in each box. One exclamation mark denotes multiplication, so each box holds 2 games: ! 2 games = 2 games.
5. determine the number of boxes required to pack up the remaining games. This can be found by dividing the number of games left by the number of games in each box: 18 games = ! x boxes. Solve for boxes:
   18 games = ! x boxes
   Substitute the number of games in each box, which we found in step 4:
   18 games = ! 2 x boxes
   To simplify the equation, let's distribute the exclamation mark:
   ! 18 games = 2 x boxes
   Since the exclamation mark is associated with multiplication, this is the same as saying:
   (18 games) * 2 = boxes
   Let's solve for boxes:
   Boxes = (18 games) * 2 = 36 boxes

Now let's put it all together:

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Understand the given information:
- There is a sale where each flower is discounted.
- Roses are represented by ':' and daisies are represented by '.'.
- Each rose is discounted by $3.
- Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies.

2. Calculate the price of one rose before the sale:
Let the original price of one rose be x.
After the discount, the price of one rose is x - 3.
Before the sale, the price of one rose was x dollars.

3. Find the price of one daisy before the sale:
Let the original price of one daisy be y.
After the discount, the price of one daisy is y - 0. (Since the sale does not apply to daisies.)
Before the sale, the price of one daisy was y dollars.

4. Calculate the total amount Emily paid:
Let the amount Emily spent on flowers be z.
Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies.
The price of each rose was x dollars.
The price of each daisy was y dollars.
The total amount Emily spent on flowers is:
z = 2(x - 3) + 2y
    (This expression represents the sum of the prices of each flower bought by Emily.)

5. Simplify the expression:
Expand and simplify the expression to find the value of z:
z = 2x - 6 + 2y

6. Find the values of x and y:
We're given that Emily spent an amount of $12 on her flowers. We have just calculated the expression for the total amount she spent (z).
Substitute $12 for z in step 5's expression, and solve for variables x and y.
$12 = 2x - 6 + 2y

7. Find the price of one rose and one daisy:
Now that we have found the values of x and y from step 6, we have the prices of one flower.
The price of one rose before the sale is:

Let's start by identifying each variable:

? = breed of puppy
! = type of puppy (presumably ""special"" or unique)

First, we are given that there were 13 puppies in the store. Let's assume there were both regular and special puppies.

? : they : sold 7 of them : and : put ! the ! rest : into cages with 2 .

We know that 7 puppies were sold (which could be a mix of regular and special puppies), and the remaining puppies (the ""rest"" of them) were put into cages with 2 puppies each. Since each cage had 2 puppies, we can divide the number of remaining puppies by 2 to find out how many cages were needed to hold them.

solved 7 puppies. Let's call the number of special puppies sold ""sp"". Again, we don't know whether all 7 puppies sold were special, but we'll keep that possibility open for now.

? : they : sold sp of them.

We know that the total number of puppies (regular and special) sold is the sum of the number of special puppies sold and the number of regular puppies sold (let's call this ""rp"").

13 = sp + rp

We can also say that the number of special puppies remaining is the difference between the number we started with and the number sold.

cages, each with 2 regular puppies, and ? put them into cages with 2 as well. (Again, this could be true for all puppies, including the special ones.)

Let's call the number of cages used to hold the regular puppies ""rc"".

? : they : put rc regular puppies : into cages with 2 .

Lastly, we're told that in total, they used ? cages to hold all the puppies, including the special ones from the ? put ! the ! rest : into cages with 2 . This number is a mixture of both regular and special puppies.

? cages did they use?

Let's summarize our identities using variables below:

sp = number of special puppies sold
rp = number of regular puppies sold
rc = number of regular puppies held in cages
total cages = number of cages used, including special puppies and regular puppies

Let's write a system of equations to solve all our identities:

13 = sp + rp
sp = total number of special puppies (from previous equation) - sp (the number we sold)
total number of special puppies = 13 - sp
total number of regular puppies = rp
total number of puppies = total number of special puppies + total number of regular puppies
total cages = rc + ? (from the previous statement)

Now, we have a System of Linear Equations, and we can solve these equations to find our missing variables.

Let's get to work!

sp + 13 - sp = rp
sp = 13 - rp

We know that 7 special puppies and some regular puppies were sold. We'll say ""sc"" was the total number of special puppies at the end of the day, after all were either sold or put into cages.

sc = sp + 7
sc = 13 - rp + 7
rc = sc - ?

We know from the passage that they put ""! the ! rest"" into cages with 2. We'll assume this is true for both regular and special puppies separately. We'll call the number of regular puppies put into cages (and held there) ""rc"".

? cages did they use? Let's use the equation that adds special and regular puppies to get total number of puppies in the store after they sold and put some of them into cages.

total number of puppies = sc - ? + rc

Let's find the total number of regular puppies:

total number of regular puppies = rc + rp

We can get the number of cages needed to hold special and regular puppies together by dividing the total number of special puppies held, minus the number of remaining special puppies, by the number of puppies per cage.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps using the information given.

Let : total number of carrots picked
: number of good carrots
: number of bad carrots

We are given that Faye picked 23 carrots and her mother picked x and 5 carrots.

Faye's carrots: 23 : carrots
Her mother's carrots: x : carrots

Total carrots picked: (23 + x) : carrots

We know that there are 12 good carrots out of every 28 carrots, which is equivalent to 42% of the carrots being good.

Let G represent the number of good carrots and B represent the number of bad carrots.

G : bad carrots = 12 : 16

G + B = 28 : carrots (total number of carrots)

Substituting the expressions for G and B into the equation for the total number of carrots, we get:

(12/16) * 28 = (G + B)

G = (G + B) * 12/16 = (x + B) * 12/16

Solving for B and subtracting G from both sides gives us the number of bad carrots.

B = (x - G) * 16/4

Substituting the expressions for G and B into the equation for the total number of carrots, we get:

(x + (x - G) * 16/4) : carrots = (x + 4x/4) : carrots = (5x/4) : carrots

Solving for x, we get:

x = (48 : good carrots) : carrots

To find the total number of bad carrots, we substitute this value of x into the expression for B:

B = (48 - 12) * 16/4 = 96/4 = 24

The total number of bad carrots is 24, and the total number of good carrots is 12 (from the given information).

Therefore, the total number of carrots is:

(5x/4 + B) : carrots = (5/4) * 48 + 24

Simplifying, we get:

(60 : carrots)

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps and show each one clearly.

1. We first need to figure out how many flowers Isabel originally had for the wedding. We know that she picked 66:flowers and was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. To find how many bouquets she made in total, we can divide the number of flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet:

   66 : flowers ÷ 8 flowers/bouquet = 83 bouquets

    {The final answer is: Isabel made 83 bouquets for the wedding.}

2. Next, we're told that 10 of the pink flowers wilted before the wedding. We don't know how many pink flowers Isabel had, only that 10 wilted. Let's call the number of pink flowers she started with x, and use a subscript to indicate that these flowers wilted:

   x _{(pink)} - 10 _{(pink)} = x - 10

   {The final answer is: Isabel has x - 10 pink flowers left.}

3. Now we know how many bouquets Isabel made in total and how many pink flowers were left, but we still haven't considered how many bouquets included pink flowers. Let's assume that some or all of the bouquets included pink flowers.

   To find how many bouquets included pink flowers, we can use the number of bouquets that contained only yellow flowers (y) and the number of bouquets that contained pink and yellow flowers (y + p) to find the total number of bouquets:

   y + (y + p) = 83 bouquets (as we found above)

   {The final answer is: Isabel made 83 bouquets, y of which contained only yellow flowers and y + p of which contained both yellow and pink flowers.}

4. We know that each bouquet contained 8 flowers, and that Isabel picked 66:flowers in total. We can find how many flowers were only yellow and how many flowers were both yellow and pink by using the number of bouquets that contained only yellow flowers and the number of bouquets that contained both yellow and pink flowers:

   8 y = 66:flowers (only yellow)

   8 (y + p) = (remaining) 66:flowers (both yellow and pink)

   Substituting our previous calculations for y, we can solve for p:

   p = (66:flowers - 8 y) ÷ 8

   {The final answer is: Isabel has (66:flowers - 8 y) pink flowers left in total, distributed among y + p of the remaining bouquets.}

5. We now know how many pink flowers were left and how many bouquets contained both yellow and pink flowers. We can find how many bouquets Isabel could still make with the remaining pink flowers:

   p bouquets contain both yellow and pink flowers, and we assume each bouquet contains 8 flowers, including both yellow and pink:

   p bouquets × 8 flowers/bouquet = (remaining) pink flowers

   {The final answer is: Isabel can still make p bouquets with the remaining pink flowers.}

6. Finally, we don't know how many yellow flowers Isabel has left. We do know that some or all of the y bouquets contained only yellow flowers, and that y + p bouquets contained both yellow and pink flowers. Since each bouquet holds 8 flowers, and we know how many pink flowers are left and how many bouquets contain only yellow flowers, we can find how many yellow flowers remain (y'):

   y bouquets × 8 yellow flowers/bouquet = y' yellow flowers

   (8 y) yellow flowers = y' yellow flowers

   {The final answer is: Isabel has y' yellow flowers remaining, distributed among y bouquets that contain only yellow flowers.}

7. Here's a summary of our findings:

   Isabel made 83 bouquets, y of which contained only yellow flowers and y + p of which contained both yellow and pink flowers. She has y' yellow flowers remaining, distributed among y bouquets that contain only yellow flowers, as well as (66:flowers - 8 y) pink flowers left in total, distributed among y +",7,7.0,8.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Firstly, we need to calculate how many tickets Oliver used for the Ferris wheel. Oliver rode the Ferris wheel 5 times, and each ride cost $1. So, the total cost of the Ferris wheel rides is $5. As 7 tickets were needed for each ride, Oliver used 35 tickets for the Ferris wheel. (5 rides x 7 tickets per ride = 35 tickets)

2. Now, let's find out how many tickets Oliver used for the bumper cars. Oliver rode the bumper cars 4 times, and each ride cost $1. Thus, the total cost of the bumper cars rides is $4. Since 6 tickets were required for each bumper car ride, Oliver spent 24 tickets on the bumper cars. (4 rides x 6 tickets per ride = 24 tickets)

3. In total, Oliver used 35 tickets for the Ferris wheel and 24 tickets for the bumper cars, making a total of 59 tickets.

4. We also know that Oliver spent a total of $7 on tickets for these two rides. So, we can calculate the cost per ticket by dividing the total amount spent on tickets by the number of tickets.

Cost per ticket = Total amount spent on tickets / Number of tickets

            = $7 / 59

            = $0.1186 (approximately 12 cents)

5. We now know that Oliver spent $0.12 on each ticket for the Ferris wheel and the bumper cars. So, we can find out how many tickets Oliver used in total by dividing the total amount spent on tickets by the cost per ticket.

Number of tickets = Total amount spent on tickets / Cost per ticket

            = $7 / $0.12

            = 56.67 tickets (approximately 57 tickets)

6. Therefore, the final answer is: Oliver used a total of approximately 57 tickets.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the variables for the unknown quantities using question marks. Here's how we can step by step through the problem:

1. First, we can identify the given information. Wendy bought 4 new chairs and 4 new tables for her house. We don't know the price of the chairs or tables, but we can represent the cost of the chairs as c and the cost of the tables as t. We also know that Wendy spent s minutes on each piece of furniture put it together.

2. The amount Wendy spent on the chairs is 4 times the cost of a single chair. Similarly, the amount she spent on the tables is 4 times the cost of a single table. Let's call the cost of a single chair and table ch and t, respectively.

3. Since Wendy spent a total of 6 times the cost of a single piece of furniture on setting it up, we can write the following equations:

c * s = 6 * ch
t * s = 6 * t

4. Next, let's represent the amount of time it took Wendy to assemble all 8 pieces of furniture as n.

5. Now, let's add up the time taken to assemble all the chairs and tables:

n = 4 * s + 4 * s

6. Simplifying this expression, we get:

n = 8 * s

7. Finally, let's equate this expression with the time taken to assemble all the pieces, which is the result of adding the times taken to assemble all the chairs and tables.

8. Therefore,

8 * s = 8 * s

9. That is, the total time taken is the same as that of assembling all the chairs because we assembled the same number of chairs and tables.

10. Thus, the only way this can happen is if Wendy took the same amount of time to assemble each chair and table.

11. Therefore, s is the time taken to assemble each piece of furniture (chair or table).

12. Let's find the total cost of all the furniture (chairs and tables):

total cost = c * 4 + t * 4

13. However, since Wendy spent a total of six times the cost of a single piece of furniture on setting it up, we have:

c + t = 6 * sh + 6 * st

14. We can solve for ch and t in terms of sh, st, ch, and t.

15. Thus, the cost of a singular chair and table can be found.

16. Finally, if we calculate the total time taken to put together all the furniture (chairs and tables), we can find the amount of time it took Wendy to finish assembling the furniture {The final answer is}.

17. To calculate the time taken, we can add the time taken to assemble each chair and table:

n = 4 * s + 4 * s = 8 * s

18. The final answer is n, which is the total time taken to assemble all the furniture.

19. Thus, we can say that {the final answer is} minutes.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps. Let's start by finding the number of games that didn't work, which we know is 74.

We can represent the total number of games Ned has as x. Then the number of non-working games is 74, which we can write as 0.74x. This is because we're taking a decimal fraction of the total number of games.

Next, let's find how many games Ned bought from his friend. He bought a total of 50 games, so this is a fixed quantity. We can write this as 50.

Now let's find how many games Ned bought from the garage sale. We're told that he bought ""27 ; more"", which means we have a compound quantity. We'll have to separate it into its constituent parts.

Let x2 be the number of games Ned bought, before the ""more"". Then the number of games Ned bought at the garage sale is 27 + x2.

Let y be the number of games that were good from the garage sale. Then the total number of games he bought from the garage sale is 27 + y.

Combining all these pieces of information, let's write the complete expression using all these variables.

x = 50 + (27 + y) + 0.74(x - (50 + 27 + y))

Let's simplify this:

x = 50 + 27 + y - 0.74(0.26x + y)

x = (1 - 0.74*0.26) * (50 + 27) + y / (1 - 0.74*0.26)

This is a complicated expression to compute by hand. But it gives us our answer:

The final answer is x / (1 - 0.74*0.26)

Step 1: Determine the number of Siamese cats (S) and house cats (H) before the sale.

C = 38 + 25
C = 63

Step 3: Determine the number of cats sold (x) during the sale.
x = 45

Step 4: Find the number of Siamese cats left (SL) after the sale.
SL = S - x (the number of Siamese cats sold was subtracted from the original number of Siamese cats)
SL = 38 - 45 (from our calculation in Step 1)
SL = -7 (we cannot have a negative number of cats, so we know that the bookkeeper made an error. Siamese cats could not have been sold during the sale.)

Step 5: Find the number of house cats left (HL) after the sale.
HL = H - x (the number of house cats sold was subtracted from the original number of house cats)
HL = 25 - 45 (from our calculation in Step 1)
HL = -20 (again, we cannot have a negative number of cats, so we know that the bookkeeper made another error. House cats could not have been sold during the sale.)

Step 6: Since we cannot have a negative number of cats left, we can assume that an error was made with the total number of cats (C) after the sale. 

Let's start over and try again.

Step 1: Determine the number of Siamese cats (S) and house cats (H) before the sale.
S = 38
H = 25

Step 2: Find the total number of cats (C) before the sale.
C = S + H
C = 38 + 25
C = 63

Step 3: Determine the number of cats sold (x) during the sale.
x = 45

Step 4: Find the number of Siamese cats left (SL) after the sale.
SL = S - x (the number of Siamese cats sold was subtracted from the original number of Siamese cats)
SL = 38 - 45 (from our calculation in Step 1)
SL = 7 (we now know that the bookkeeper's mistake was that they forgot to subtract the number of Siamese cats sold from the original number of Siamese cats when finding how many they had left.)

Step 5: Determine the number of house cats left (HL) after the sale.
HL = H - (C - S - x) (to find the number of house cats left, we need to find the total number of cats left after the sale and then subtract both the Siamese cats sold and the number of house cats sold from this total. This will leave us with the number of house cats left.)
HL = 25 - (63 - 38 - 45)
HL = 3 (we now know that the bookkeeper's mistake was that they forgot to subtract the number of house cats sold from the original number of house cats when finding how many they had left.)

Step 6: Combine the results from Step 4 and Step 5 to find the total number of cats (C') left after the sale.
C' = SL + HL
C' = 7 + 3
C' = 10 (we now know that the bookkeeper's mistake was that they forgot to subtract the number of cats sold from the original number of cats when finding how many they had left, resulting in a higher number of cats remaining than what was actually true.)

To find out how many points Carol had at the end of the game, we need to add up the points she scored in each round. In the first round, she scored 17 points. In the second round, she scored 6 points. Unfortunately, the text doesn't provide us with information about the third round, but it does tell us that Carol lost 16 points. This suggests that she scored fewer than 0 points in the third round, which is not possible.

Let's assume that the author made a mistake here and that Carol actually scored 0 points in the third round, which would mean that she lost 16 points in that round as well. Here's how we can calculate the total number of points she had at the end of the game:

First round: 17 points
Second round: 6 points
Third round (assuming 0 points): 0 points

Total points: 17 points in the first round + 6 points in the second round + 0 points in the third round = 23 points

But wait, there's a problem. We're told that Carol lost 16 points in the third round, but she didn't have any points left to lose after the second round. This means that we need to revise our assumption and assume that the author made another mistake. Let's think about what's plausible here. If Carol scores a lot of points in the third round, she might overtake the other players and win the game with a good lead. However, if she scores very few points or even loses some points, there might not be much point in including that result in the story. It's possible that the author just forgot to include the third round or decided that it wasn't necessary to mention it.

If we ignore the third round (assuming that it's not very relevant to the story), we can calculate the number of points Carol had at the end of the second round:

First round: 17 points
Second round: 6 points

Total points: 23 points

Now, Carol hasn't had a chance to lose more points, so she still has 23 points at the end of the game. We can indicate the final answer by ending with:

{The final answer is } 23 points, which is the total number of points Carol had at the end of the game, assuming that the author forgot to include the points she scored (or lost) in the third round.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of chocolate pieces Dave originally had. Each box has 3 pieces, and Dave bought 12 boxes. So, there are 39 (12 × 3) pieces in total.
2. Dave gave 5 boxes to his little brother. After this gift, how many boxes does Dave have left? We can calculate this by finding the difference between the total number of boxes before the gift and the number of boxes Dave gave away.
   Before the gift: 12 boxes
   Gift: -5 boxes
   After the gift: ? boxes
   So, there are now 7 (12 - 5) boxes left.
3. Now, find the number of chocolate pieces Dave has left after this gift. Multiply the number of boxes left by the number of pieces in each box.
   Number of boxes: 7
   Number of pieces in each box: 3
   Number of pieces left: ?
4. How many pieces does Dave's little brother have now? This is the same as the number of pieces Dave gave away.
   Number of pieces: 5 × 3 = 15
5. Add up the number of pieces Dave has left and the number his little brother has to get the total number of chocolate pieces.
   Number of pieces Dave has left: Step 3
   Number of pieces Dave's little brother has: 15

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we'll first need to calculate the number of customers the waiter had during the lunch rush after the additional 12 customers. We can do this by adding the initial number of customers (39) to the number of customers added during the lunch rush (12):

39 customers + 12 added customers = 51 customers during the lunch rush

Now, we know that 49% of the customers at The Greasy Spoon restaurant didn't leave a tip. To find the number of tips-less customers during the lunch rush, we'll need to calculate 49% of the lunch rush customers. To do this, we can create an expression using the formula tips-less customers = total customers × fraction of tips-less customers:

tips-less customers = (51 customers) × 0.49

tips-less customers = 25.09 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, during the lunch rush, there were 25.09 tips-less customers.

Next, we need to find the number of customers who left a tip during the lunch rush. By definition, this is the number of customers who left a tip minus the tips-less customers. Using our knowledge of the percent of tips-less customers, we can calculate the number of customers who left a tip during the lunch rush as follows:

customers who left a tip = total customers during the lunch rush - tips-less customers

customers who left a tip = 51 customers - 25.09 tips-less customers

customers who left a tip = 25.91 (rounded to two decimal places)

But wait! We're solving for the number of customers who left a tip during the lunch rush only, not during the entire shift. If we recall, we're missing the waiter's initial number of customers before the lunch rush. Let's say at the start of his shift, there were 17 customers. Now, let's calculate the number of customers who left a tip during the entire shift:

customers who left a tip (entire shift) = customers who left a tip during the lunch rush + initial number of customers

customers who left a tip (entire shift) = 25.91 (lunch rush) + 17 (initial)

customers who left a tip (entire shift) = 42.91 (rounded to two decimal places)

Finally, we can calculate the percentage of customers who left a tip, as the number of customers who left a tip is a portion of the entire number of customers:

percentage of customers who left a tip = (customers who left a tip) / (total number of customers)

percentage of customers who left a tip = (42.91) / ([initial + lunch rush customers] + [lunch rush tips-less customers])

percentage of customers who left a tip = 0.94

Alternatively, we can find the tip amount as follows:

total tip = (percentage of customers who left a tip) × (total amount paid in tips by customers)

total tip = (0.94) × ([initial + lunch rush customers] × (average tip per customer))

total tip = [initial + lunch rush customers] × (tip amount per customer)

The final answer is that the tip amount per customer was $1.25 [($51 + 17) customers × (($51 + 17) × 0.15) tip %] divided by [($51 + 17) customers - 25.09 tips-less customers] customers who left a tip. This gives $1.80 in total tip amount, which we'll round to $2.00, the next highest multiple of $0.25.

The final answer is the waiter had 42.91 customers who left a tip at The Greasy Spoon restaurant, leaving a tip of approximately $2.00 each. This totals about $87.90 in tips during the entire shift, bringing the waiter's total earnings for the day to approximately $129.49.

To solve this problem, we can use a systematic approach, breaking it down into smaller, manageable pieces. Here's how:

1. First, let's define some variables to help us organize the information and make the problem easier to follow:
   - N = total number of apples in the cafeteria
   - L = number of apples handed out for lunch
   - R = remaining apples after lunch is served
   - C = number of students who decide to use the apples for lunch
   - P = number of students who decide to use the apples to make pies
   - A = number of apples needed to make one pie

2. Next, let's use the given information to create some equations that relate our variables. We'll start with the total number of apples:
   - N = L + R
   - Substituting the values we know, we get: N = .50 . Apples + R

3. Now, let's find the number of apples handed out for lunch:
   - L = C * .50 . Apples
   - This simplifies to L = C * .50

4. Since we don't know the exact value of C, we'll leave this equation as is for now.

5. Finally, let's find the number of apples that students P use to make pies:
   - P * A = R
   - This simplifies to P * A = N - L

6. Using the value of L that we calculated in step 3, we can substitute into this equation to eliminate the variable R. This gives us:
   - P * A = N - C * .50

7. Since we're trying to find the number of pies that can be made, let's solve for P:
   - P = (N - C * .50) / A

8. Now that we have an expression for P, we can substitute our known variables into it to find the number of pies. However, we're still missing the value of C.

9. To find C, let's use our original equation for the number of apples handed out for lunch:
   - C * .50 = L
   - This gives us: C = L / .50

10. With the value of C in hand, we can substitute it into our expression for P:
   - P = ((N - L / .50) / A

11. And that's it! We've found a formula for the number of pies that can be made.

12. Let's plug our specific values into our final formula to see how many pies the cafe could make:
   - Suppose there are 100 apples in the cafeteria.
   - About .50 or 50 of the apples were given out for lunch.
   - Of those apples, .25 or 25 of the students decided to use the apples for lunch.
   - The remaining .75 or 75 students decided to use the apples to make pies.
   - Based on the given information, each pie takes 5 apples.

13. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the formula to find the number of pies:
   - P = ((N - C * .50) / A
   - P = ((100 - 25 * .50) / 5
   - P = 30

14. So, assuming all of the remaining apples are used to make pies, we find that we could make 30 pies.

15. The final answer is: The cafe could make 30 pies with the remaining apples.


This step-by-step process helps us confirm that the final answer is reasonable, and it gives us a clear understanding of how we got there. This is key to solving complex problems, as it allows us to double-check our work and ensure that we're on the right track.

<|assistant|>
Let's first simplify the problem by creating variables for each unknown quantity. 

x = dollars Oliver had in January
y = dollars spent by March
z = dollars Oliver got from mom

We are given:
x = 33
y = 4
z = another 32 dollars from mom

? = dollars Oliver would have by the end of March

To find the total amount Oliver had after receiving money from his mom, we can use the equation:

? = x + z

To find the total amount Oliver spent by March, we can use:

y = x - (total amount Oliver would have at the end of March)

Let's solve for the total amount Oliver would have at the end of March (?):

? = x + z

y = x - ?

We can substitute our initial value of x into the second equation and solve for ?:

y = 33 - ?

We are also given that y = 4. Substitution gives us:

4 = 33 - ?

We can now add ? to both sides:

4 + ? = 33

Let's separate this into two equations:

4 = 33 - 33 (set up a mathematical identity)

? = 0 (substitution)

We have found that Oliver would have $0 left by the end of March. This cannot happen, as it would mean Oliver spent more than he had. Therefore, we have a logical inconsistency in the problem, and our assumption that the given conditions could exist leads to an illogical result. In mathematics, this is known as an ""impossible"" problem, meaning it cannot be solved as presented. However, we can modify the conditions to create a logical and solvable problem.</s>",61,61.0,0.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can approach it in the following steps:

1. Let x represent the number of apples in the school cafeteria.
   - We are given that x = 14.

2. If they used 13 apples to make lunch for y students, how many apples would they have used in total?
   - The number of apples used to make lunch for y students is 13y.
   - To find out how many apples were used in total (including those remaining for future use), we add the remaining x-13y apples.
   - The total number of apples used is 13y + (x - 13y).

3. We are given that they bought an additional 49 apples.
   - To calculate the number of apples they would have after buying these 49 new apples, we add it to the number of apples they had before buying them.
   - The number of apples they have after buying the 49 new apples is x + 49.

4. Now let's see how many apples they would have had if they didn't buy these 49 new apples.
   - Here we use the formula we found in step 2, where we have y students and initially x-13y apples.
   - The number of apples they would have had if they hadn't bought these extra 49 apples is 13y + (x - 13y) = x-49.

5. The final question asks how many more apples they would have if they hadn't bought these new 49 apples.
   - We find this by subtracting the number of apples they would have had if they hadn't bought the 49 apples from the number of apples they have after buying them.
   - The final answer is: they would have had x-49 apples if they hadn't bought these new 49 apples. They currently have x + 49 apples, so they have (x + 49) - (x-49) = 98 additional apples.
   - {The final answer is 98 more apples.}

So, the total number of apples they would have had without buying the extra 49 would be x-49 apples. After buying the extra 49 apples, they ended up with a total of (x-49) + 49 = x+49 apples, meaning they have 98 more apples than they would have had without buying the extra 49 apples.</s>",50,50.0,49.0

To find Frank's final score, we need to calculate the total number of points he earned from both halves.

Let's define some variables to make the problem easier to follow:

- n: the number of questions in each half (given as ?)
- m: the number of questions Frank successfully answered in the first half (given as !)
- x: the number of questions Frank successfully answered in the second half

In the first half, Frank earned m points, since each question was worth 3 points.

m = 3 * m questions
m = 3n/2 * m questions
m = (3/2)*n*m answers

In the second half, Frank earned x points.

x = 3 * x questions
x = 3n/2 * x answers

Adding up the points earned in both halves, we get Frank's total score:

final score = points in the first half + points in the second half
final score = (3/2)*n*m answers + (3/2)*n*x answers
final score = (3/2)*n*(m+x) answers

{The final answer is:} (3/2)*n*(m+x) answers

To find the exact values of m and x, we need to substitute the ! notation, which is equivalent to an unknown number. However, since we know that m and x are integers, we can assume that they are both whole numbers, and take the nearest integer value for n (for simplicity, we choose n = 10).

Let's say Frank had 3 questions correct in the first half (m=3). At the end of the first half, here's how his score looks like:

m = 10 * (3 * 3) / 2 = 45 points

Now, let's assume that Frank had some questions wrong in the second half (maybe around 2 out of 10). We don't know exactly, but let's assume that the number of correct answers in the second half is x = 8.

x = 10 * (3 * 8) / 2 = 56 points

Adding up the points from both halves, Frank's final score is:

final score = m + x = 45 + 56 = 101 points

2. Now, let's find the number of mittens that Zoe has. Again, she found 8 boxes and inside each box, there are 6 mittens. Therefore, Zoe has a total of 48 mittens (8 boxes x 6 mittens per box).

3. To find the total number of winter clothing items that Zoe has, we need to add the number of scarves and the number of mittens. In total, Zoe has 32 scarves and 48 mittens, making a total of 80 winter clothing items (32 scarves + 48 mittens).

<|assistant|>
First, let's identify the variables.

- Frank and his friend's names are unknown, so we'll use question marks (?) for now.
- The type of item being purchased is also unknown, so we'll use another set of question marks (?) for this as well.
- The name of the shop is ""the magic shop,"" but we'll simplify that to just the shop's name (M) for brevity.
- The price of each trick deck is $7, so we'll use a dollar sign ($) followed by a number (7) to represent this.

Next, let's translate the English problem into an algebraic equation system. Here's how we might do that:

- We have two people, Frank and his friend, buying trick decks. Let's call the cost for Frank's decks x, and the cost for his friend's decks y.

- We know the price of each trick deck is $7. Let's call that p.

- Our first equation will represent the total cost of Frank's decks (3 decks): x = p * 3

- Our second equation will represent the total cost of his friend's decks (2 decks): y = p * 2

- Now we're ready to set up our third equation: this will represent the total amount spent at the shop (Frank's and his friend's costs). Let's call this T: T = x + y + the shop's cost (let's assume this is 0, since we're not including any costs for the shop itself).

Putting this all together, here's what we get:

- Frank's costs: x = p * 3

- His friend's costs: y = p * 2

- Total costs: T = x + y + 0 (the shop's cost is zero)

Now, we're ready to solve the system and find the final answers. Let's work through the steps:

1. Starting with the second equation, we can solve for just y (his friend's costs): y = p * 2

2. Next, we can substitute this expression for y into the first equation, substituting p for the price of each trick deck: x = p * 3 = p * 6 (his friend's total costs)

3. With these expressions in hand, we can now substitute them into the third equation, using the fact that the shop's cost is zero: T = p * 6 + p * 6 = 2p

4. Now we have an equation with just one variable (p), which we can solve: 2p = T

5. To find the final answer we're looking for, we can substitute the expression we've just found for p back into either the first or second equation, replacing all occurrences of p with 2p: x = T / 3 = 2/3 * T

6. Alternatively, we can use y = p * 2 = T / 2 to find his friend's costs: y = T / 2

- Overall, then, the cost of Frank's decks is x = T / 3 (2/3 of the total cost, T), and the cost of his friend's decks is y = T / 2 (50% of the total cost, T).

- To find the final answer we're looking for (the total cost, T), we could substitute our expressions for x and y into the original equation, T = x + y + 0. However, we know what T is already, since we've been solving for it throughout this process.

So, our final answer is: {The total cost is T, which is found by solving the original equation system: X = P * 3, y = P * 2, and T = X + Y + 0.}</s>",35,35.0,0.0

<|assistant|>
Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Let x be the number of short sleeve shirts that Sam washed before school. This means that the number of short sleeve shirts that Sam didn't wash before school is 40 - x.

2. Let y be the number of long sleeve shirts that Sam washed before school. This means that the number of long sleeve shirts that Sam didn't wash before school is 23 - y.

3. We know that Sam had to wash a total of 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts before school. Using the sum rule for sets, we can write this as:

   x + (40 - x) short sleeve shirts = 40 short sleeve shirts

   y + (23 - y) long sleeve shirts = 23 long sleeve shirts

4. Simplifying the first equation, we get:

   x + 40 - x = 40

   Simplifying, we have:

   40 = 40

   This is a true statement, so our solution is correct.

5. Simplifying the second equation, we get:

   y + 23 - y = 23

   Simplifying, we have:

   23 = 23

   Again, this is a true statement, so our solution is correct.

6. However, the question asks us to find the number of shirts that Sam didn't wash before the start of school. Using the same method as before, we can rewrite the equations in terms of how many shirts haven't been washed yet:

   (40 - x) short sleeve shirts = number of short sleeve shirts that Sam didn't wash before school

   (23 - y) long sleeve shirts = number of long sleeve shirts that Sam didn't wash before school

7. We know from the second equation that (23 - y) equals the number of long sleeve shirts that haven't been washed yet. Let's call this R. We also know that 29 of these long sleeve shirts have been washed by the time school starts.

8. To find out what fraction of long sleeve shirts hasn't been washed by the time school starts, let's divide the number of long sleeve shirts that haven't been washed yet, R, by the total number of long sleeve shirts that Sam has to wash, 23.

   \frac{R}{23} = fraction of long sleeve shirts that haven't been washed by the time school starts

9. Next, we know that x short sleeve shirts haven't been washed before school. To find out how many of these shirts haven't been washed by the time school starts, let's think about the total number of short sleeve shirts that Sam has to wash before school and how many of them have been washed already.

   The total number of short sleeve shirts that Sam has to wash before school is 40. The number of short sleeve shirts that haven't been washed before school is x. Let's call the number of short sleeve shirts that haven't been washed by the time school starts S. We also know that some of these short sleeve shirts have been washed between the time Sam did the laundry before school and the time school starts. Let's call this number Q.

10. Now let's think about how these two groups of short sleeve shirts overlap. Some of the short sleeve shirts that haven't been washed by the time school starts, S, have also been washed between the time Sam did the laundry before school and the time school starts, Q. Therefore, the number of short sleeve shirts that haven't been washed by the time school starts that haven't been washed between the time Sam did the laundry before school and the time school starts is S-Q.

11. Let's calculate how many short sleeve shirts haven't been washed by the time school starts but have been washed between the time Sam did the laundry before school and the time school starts. To find this out, let's think about the total number of short sleeve shirts that Sam has to wash between the time he did the laundry before school and the time school starts, N. We also know that 29 of these shirts have been washed by the time school starts. Let's call this number M. The number of short sleeve shirts that haven't been",34,34.0,29.0

Let x denote the number of customers the waiter had at the beginning.

We are given that x waiter had 47 customers to wait on. After 41 customers left, the waiter was still left with some customers to wait on. So, the number of customers after 41 customers left is (x - 41) waiter.

Further, 20 more customers came, making the new number of customers (x - 41 + 20) waiter.

Now, we can find the number of customers the waiter would have had if the original 47 customers remained. In other words, we want to find x:

x waiter had 47 customers to wait on.
(x - 41) waiter had 41 customers left to wait on.
(x - 41) waiter now has (x - 41 + 20) customers, which is equivalent to x waiter having (x - 41 + 20 - x) waiter, or 1 waiter, since we subtracted the number of waiters required to serve the original customers.

So, we can set up a system of equations to find x:

x waiter had 47 customers to wait on.
(x - 41) waiter had 41 customers left to wait on.
1 waiter now has (x - 41 + 20) customers.

To solve this system of equations, we set up a tableau and solve for the variable x:

|      | x    | -41     |   0   |
|:----:|:----:|:------:|:-----:|
| x  | 1   | 0      | 0     |
| -41| 0   | 1      | 0     |
|  47| 0   | -41    | 1     |

To solve this system, we perform row operations until we reach a form where the left column has a left recursive form, that is all variables should be zero in the left column.

|      | x    | -41     |   0   |
|:----:|:----:|:------:|:-----:|
| x  | 0   | 1      | 0     |
| -41| 0   | 0      | 1     |
|  47| 1   | 0      | 0     |

Thus, x = -47, which is not feasible due to negative value for customers. This indicates no feasible solution exists. 

To rephrase the final result in English, there is no feasible solution to the system, therefore there is no answer to the original question.

{The final answer is}: No feasible solution exists.</s>",26,26.0,47.0
