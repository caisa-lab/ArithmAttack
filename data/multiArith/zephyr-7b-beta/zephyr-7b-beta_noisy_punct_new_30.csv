<|assistant|>
Step 1: 
Paige had 11 songs on her MP3 player before making any changes. We'll call this number of songs ""initial songs.""

Step 2: 
Paige deleted 9 old songs from her MP3 player, leaving behind 2 (initial songs - 9 old songs = 2 remaining songs) songs on her player after removing the old songs.

Step 3: 
Paige added 8 new songs to the 2 remaining songs, increasing her total number of songs to 10 (2 remaining songs + 8 new songs = 10 total songs).

Step 4: 
We have determined that Paige has 10 songs on her MP3 player after making these changes. Let's name this number of songs ""final songs.""

The final answer is: Paige has 10 final songs on her MP3 player after deleting 9 old songs and adding 8 new songs.</s>",10

                     There were ! 39 girls and ? 4 boys trying ; out ; for the schools ? basketball team. If only ; 26 of : them got called ! back, how many students didn't ! make the cut? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's assign a variable to represent the number of boys who tried out. Since the total number of students who tried out was ! 39 + ? boys, we can set up an equation to find the value of the unknown variable:

! 39 + ? = !Total

Notice that we're using the double factorial notation here instead of regular factorials (single factorials are denoted with an !). In general, n double factorial is defined as n(n-2)(n-4)...(3 or 5, depending on whether n is odd or even). This notation is often used in combinatorics and probability problems.

Next, we know that out of the total number of students who tried out, 26 (exactly) were selected. So we can create another equation to relate the number of boys selected to the total selected:

26 = ! Girls + Boys selected

Let's substitute the number of total tryouts in terms of the number of girls and boys to simplify this equation:

26 = (! 39 + ?) girls + Boys selected

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (the number of girls and the number of boys selected). We can use algebra to eliminate one of the unknowns and find the other.

Let's start by solving for the number of boys selected in terms of the number of girls:

? = (! 39 - Girls) / (Boys selected - Girls) * (26 - Girls)

Plug this expression for ? into the first equation we created, and simplify:

! 39 + (39) / (Boys selected - Girls) * (Boys selected - Girls) = !Total

Notice that we have a quadratic equation in terms of Boys selected, and we know both constants and the coefficient of the quadratic term (the -Girls term). So we can find the solution(s) using the quadratic formula:

Boys selected = (-B ± √(B^2 - 4AC)) / 2A,

where B, C, and A are obtained from the quadratic equation above:

B = -(39) * (Girls) * (Girls - 1)
C = (-1) * (Girls) * (Girls - 1) * (26 - Girls)
A = !

Now we're ready to find how many students didn't make the cut. Simply subtract the number of students who made the cut (26) from the total number of students who tried out:

Students who didn't make the cut = !Total - 26

To summarize, the steps to solve this problem might look like this:

1. Set up equations based on the given information
2. Solve for one of the unknowns in terms of the other(s)
3. Eliminate one of the unknowns from one of the equations, and solve for the remaining unknown
4. Use the formula for Students who didn't make the cut to find the number who were not selected

Finally, the answer to this problem is:

The final answer is: {Students who didn't make the cut} = !Total - 26

where !Total is calculated using the number of girls and the number of boys selected.</s>",17

<|assistant|>
Let's call the number of coloring books Faye had initially as x.

After giving away 3 books, Faye would have x-3 coloring books left.

Then, Faye bought 48 more coloring books, so the total number of coloring books she had after purchasing more is (x-3) + 48.

Let's write an equation for this:
 
 (x-3) + 48 = total number

To find the total number of coloring books Faye has, we can separate the expression into two calculations, adding what she already had (x-3) and what she bought (48).

Simplifying the expression, we get:

x + 45 = total number

To find the total number of coloring books Faye has, we can substitute the value of x into our simplified equation from step 3.

The final answer is:

Faye has a total of x + 45 coloring books.</s>",79
" . The school : cafeteria had 23 apples. If ; they used 20 to ! make , lunch for the : students : and then bought : 6 more, how many apples would they have? ","<|user|>

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     . The school : cafeteria had 23 apples. If ; they used 20 to ! make , lunch for the : students : and then bought : 6 more, how many apples would they have? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can create a system of equations to represent the number of apples in each scenario.

Let x represent the number of apples in the school and y represent the number of apples in the cafeteria. Additionally, let s represent the number of apples used to make lunches for the students and t represent the number of extra apples purchased.

We can create the following equations:

1. Initially, the sum of the number of apples in the school and cafeteria is 23. This translates to:

x + y = 23

2. When they used 20 apples to make lunches for the students, the number of apples in the school remained unchanged (they didn't use any from the cafeteria). This translates to:

x = x - 20 (subtracting the number of apples used from the initial number)

3. After making lunches, there were y - s remaining in the cafeteria. This translates to:

y = y - s

4. Later, they bought t more apples. The total number of apples after buying more becomes:

x + y + t = ?

Let's organize all these equations into a system:

x + y = 23 (Equation 1)
x = x - 20 (Equation 2)
y = y - s (Equation 3)

We're working with a system of equations because we have more than one equation and we're trying to find the values of multiple variables (x, y, s, and t).

In our case, we have four equations and four unknown variables, so to solve for all the variables, we need to find a way to eliminate one of them using algebraic manipulations such as addition or subtraction.

Let's start by isolating x in Equation 2 and combining it with Equation 1 to eliminate y:

x = x - 20
y = y - s

We add these equations to get:

x + y = x - 20 + y - s (Equation 4)

Notice that now x and y are on the left-hand side of the equation, which means we have successfully eliminated the variable y from the system.

Next, let's substitute for y in Equation 4 using Equation 3 to eliminate s:

x + (y - s) = x - 20 + y - s

Simplify:

x - s + s = x - 20

Now, let's combine like terms (variables with the same exponent and coefficients):

x - s = x - 20

We have x on both sides of the equation, so we can subtract x from both sides:

-s = -20

Now, let's divide both sides by -1 to obtain the values of the remaining variables:

s = 20

Back-substituting s in Equation 4, we get:

x + (y - 20) = x

The equations look the same now because we've eliminated all unknown variables except x, but the second term (y - 20) is different from before due to the substitution made in step 4.

Now we've got equations where all the terms except one are known. This type of equation is called a constant equation with a unique solution. Here we have an implicit variable x.

Our solution for x is:

x = ?

At this point, we don't know the value of x, so we can't determine how many apples are left in the school or the cafeteria or how many they ate or bought. However, we do know that after buying 6 more apples, they'll have a total of 23 apples again (the initial number). Let's substitute the value of s and t in Equation 1 and 3 to calculate how many extra apples they bought and what's left in the cafeteria:

x + y = 23 (Equation 1)
x = x - 20 (Equation 2)
y = y - 20 (Step 4)

Now substitute for s and t:

x + y - 20 - 6 = 23

Simplify:

x + y - 26 = 23",9

                    question:
                     In : a video game, each enemy ? defeated gives ! you ; 9 , points. If a , level . has ; 11 enemies ; total and you ! destroy all but 3 of them, how many points would you earn? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find out how many points we would earn for defeating enemies in a video game, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of points earned per enemy, which is ! points.
2. Find the number of enemies in level n, which is 11.
3. Determine the number of enemies left after defeating all but 3 of them. We can use the formula for finding the number of elements remaining when an n-element set is transformed into an (n-k)-element set, which is (1):

   a = b - c, where a is the number of elements remaining, b is the total number of elements, and c is the number of elements removed. 

   So for our problem, we can say:

   a = b - c

   b = 11 (number of enemies in level n)

   c = 8 (number of enemies we're destroying)

   Substituting these values into (1), we have:

   a = 11 - 8

   a = 3

   Therefore, we have 3 enemies remaining.

4. Calculate the total points earned using the formula:

   Total points = number of enemies defeated x points earned per enemy

   Let's find the number of enemies defeated. Since we're destroying 8 of the original 11 enemies, the number of enemies defeated is:

   Number of enemies defeated = 11 - 3 (the remaining enemies) - 8 (the enemies we're destroying)

   Number of enemies defeated = 8

   So our equation for total points looks like this:

   Total points = 8 ! + (11 - 3) ! (the remaining enemies are worth ! points each since we defeated them already)

5. Simplify the equation for total points by performing calculations:

   Total points = 8 ! + 8 ! (since we defeated all 8 enemies in this level)

   Using the relationship ! (n) = (n-1) !, we can simplify:

   Total points = (8-1) ! + (8-1) !

   Total points = 7 ! + 7 !

6. Determine the final answer, which is the calculated total points earned.

   So, the final answer is:

   Total points = 7 * 6 = 42

   And for this level, we would earn a total of 42 points.</s>",72

<|assistant|>
Step 1: Identify the known quantities.
- Megan earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled.
- Megan had 14 bags in total.
- Megan did not recycle 5 bags.

Step 2: Determine the number of bags Megan recycled.
- Megan recycled 14 - 5 = 9 bags.

Step 3: Calculate the number of points Megan earned from recycling.
- Megan earned 8 points for each of the 9 bags she recycled.
- Therefore, she earned 8 * 9 = 72 points from recycling.

Step 4: Determine the total number of points Megan earned.
- Megan earned points from recycling and from the remaining bags she did not recycle.
- She earned 72 points from recycling 9 bags, and she earned 0 points from recycling the 5 bags she did not recycle.
- Therefore, Megan earned a total of 72 points from recycling and 0 points from the remaining bags.
- Finally, let's include the points she may have earned from the non-recycled bags.
- Megan earned 8 points for each of the 4 bags she did not recycle.
- Therefore, she earned 8 * 4 = 32 points from the bags she did not recycle.
- As a result, the total number of points Megan earned is the sum of 72, 0, and 32.
- That is, Megan earned a total of 104 points.

The final answer is: Megan earned 104 points.</s>",72

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the original 13 roses before the discount:

   Total cost before discount = 13 roses each at $4 = $52

2. Calculate the discount:

   As the text mentions ""having a ? sale,"" we can infer that there is some uncertainty about the discount. Let's assume the discount is a certain percentage, so the price after the discount is:

   Price after discount = (1 - discount) * $4

3. Calculate the discount percentage:

   Let's call the discount percentage x. Applying the discount formula, we have:

   $4 - (1 - x) * $4 = (1 - x) * $4

   Simplifying, we get:

   $4 * (1 - x) = $4 * x

   So, x is the value that solves the equation:

   $x = 1 - \frac{4}{13}$

   Substituting x back in the discount formula, we find the discount percentage:

   Discount percentage = (1 - x) * 100

4. Calculate the price after the discount:

   Using the discount percentage found in step 3, we can calculate the price after the discount:

   Price after discount = (1 - discount percentage/100) * $4

5. Calculate the total cost of the remaining 9 roses:

   Total cost after discount for the remaining 9 roses = 9 roses each at the discounted price = $3.60

6. Calculate the total earnings from the roses:

   Total earnings from the sale = Total cost before discount - Total cost after discount = $52 - $36 = $16

7. Final answer:

   The final answer is: April earned $16 from the sales of her flowers.</s>",36

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this word problem, we'll need to use algebra to represent some unknown quantities and then work through each step of the problem to find the final answer. Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. Let x represent the number of short sleeve shirts Ned washed before school. We can write this as:
   x = number of short sleeve shirts Ned washed before school

2. We know that Ned had to wash a total of 9 short sleeve shirts before school. Using our first line of reasoning, we can replace ""number of short sleeve shirts Ned washed before school"" with the variable x we introduced.
   x = 9 (short sleeve shirts)

3. Now, let's move on to the long sleeve shirts. We know that Ned had to wash 21 long sleeve shirts before school. If we let y represent the number of long sleeve shirts Ned washed before school, we can write this as:
   y = number of long sleeve shirts Ned washed before school

4. Using this new variable, we can find how many long sleeve shirts Ned washed before school:
   y = 21 (long sleeve shirts)

5. In the next section, we're told that Ned had to wash 29 short sleeve shirts in total. Let's use the variable x we already introduced to see how many of the 29 total short sleeve shirts were washed before school.
   x + 20 = 29 (total short sleeve shirts)

6. This equation tells us that the number of short sleeve shirts Ned washed before school (x) plus the number he didn't wash before school (20) equals the total number of short sleeve shirts he washed (29). Solving for x gives us the number of short sleeve shirts Ned washed before school.

7. Finally, let's see how many short sleeve and long sleeve shirts Ned had not washed before school started. We know that the total number of short sleeve shirts he had not washed (20 - x) plus the total number of long sleeve shirts he had not washed (21 - y) equals the number he had not washed in total (let's call this z).
   z = (20 - x) + (21 - y) (short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts)

8. We can now solve for z, finding the total number of shirts Ned had not washed before school started.

9. Overall, this equation tells us that the total number of shirts that weren't washed before school started is equal to the number of short sleeve shirts (20 - x) he hadn't washed before school, plus the number of long sleeve shirts (21 - y) he also hadn't washed yet.

10. At the end, we're given the final answer: {The final answer is}. Let's now fill in the blanks with our solutions from steps 6 and 8:

   {Ned had not washed a total of (20 - x) short sleeve shirts plus (21 - y) long sleeve shirts, for a total of z shirts, before school started}.

11. To simplify the final expression, let's write this as:

   z = 20 - x + 21 - y (total number of shirts he hadn't washed before school started)

12. To find a simpler expression, we can combine terms with the same variables (x and y) and simplify:

   z = 41 - (x + y) (total number of shirts he hadn't washed before school started)</s>",1

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the number of people who showed up as x and the number of tables required as y.

We're given that 47 people were invited, 7 of them didn't show up, so the number of people who did show up is x - 7. Each table can hold 5 people, so the number of tables needed is (x - 7) / 5.

The number of people who did not show up is 7, so the number of people present at the luncheon (x) is the original number invited (47) minus the number who didn't show up (7):

x = 47 - 7 = 40

Substituting this into our formula for the number of tables required, we get:

y = (x - 7) / 5
y = (40 - 7) / 5
y = 6.8 tables (rounded up)

As we can only order entire tables, we'll need to round up our answer to ensure we have enough tables.

So, the company needs 7 tables in total, since they invited 7 people who did not show up. They need an additional 6.8 tables for the remaining 40 people who did attend, making a total of 13.8 tables, which we round up to 14.

The final answer is: they need 14 tables.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Tom had 5 books initially. {The final answer is 5 books.}
2. Tom sold 4 of his 5 books. So, the number of books Tom had after selling some of them is 5 - 4 = 1 book. {The final answer is 1 book.}
3. The money Tom earned from selling the 4 books can be found using the concept of selling price and cost price. Suppose Tom sold each book for Rs x and each book cost Rs y. Then,

   x = selling price per book,

   y = cost price per book.

   Tom had originally paid Rs 5Y for the 5 books. After selling 4 of them, Tom's total earnings from the sale would be Rs 4X. With this money, Tom purchased 38 new books. So, to find the value of x and y, we write

   x * 4 = 5Y - 3800,         {From the sale}

   and

   x = (selling price per book),

   y = (cost price per book).

   Let's solve these equations concurrently.

4. We write the equation from the sale as:

    x * 4 = 5Y - 3800.          {(1)}

5. The equation for finding the selling price per book (x) is:

    x = (selling price per book).

6. To find the cost price per book (y), we substitute (x) from (5) into (4).

7. Then, rewrite the y in terms of x, where:

    y = (5 * x - 3800)/4,          {(6)}

    since Tom had to spend 5 times the cost price and not as x in (5), we multiply 5 to (x) here.

8. We substitute the value of y from (6) back into (1) and write it as:

     x * 4 = 5 * x - 3800.

9. We simplify (8):

     x/5 = x - 760.

10. We subtract x from both sides of (9), obtaining:

     -x/5 = -760.

11. Dividing both sides of (10) by -1/5, we re-express it in terms of x only to get:

    x = 5 * 760.

12. From (11), we get the cost price per book as:

    y = 5 * 760/4 = 1900.

13. Substituting the value of y and x in step (2), we get the number of books Tom had after selling some of them.

    The number of books Tom had after selling some of them = 1 - 4 = -3 books. However, since we cannot have fractional or negative number of books, we can say that Tom didn’t have any books after selling some of them.

    Now, we want to find the number of books Tom had after purchasing new books.

14. From the text, we know that Tom sold 4 books and used the money earned to purchase 38 new books. Therefore, in total, Tom had sold 4 books and bought 38 new books, meaning he's had a net total of 4 - 38 = -34 books. That is, after selling some of his books and purchasing new ones, Tom had -34 books left.

15. We add the number of books Tom had initially (5 books) with the remaining number of books (-34), using the law of conservation of mass.

    The final number of books Tom had is:

    {The final answer is } -29 books. However, since we cannot have fractional or negative number of books, we can say that Tom didn’t have any books left.

    Therefore, Tom did not have any books after buying 38 new books, despite having sold 4 earlier.

    It's quite possible that the author, in step (2), had a typo or a mistake in the text, which results in an inconsistency in the final answer.

    So, our analysis shows that Tom did not have any books left, even after",39

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first convert the number of sodas Jerry bought into the total number of bottles.

Number of regular sodas = 41
Number of diet sodas = 22

Let's assume that each regular soda bottle contains 12 oz, and each diet soda bottle contains 12 oz as well. This means that Jerry bought a total of 492 oz (12 oz per bottle times 41 regular sodas) of regular soda and 264 oz (12 oz per bottle times 22 diet sodas) of diet soda.

Total number of bottles = Number of regular bottles + Number of diet bottles

Total number of regular bottles = Number of regular bottles per oz / Number of oz per bottle
Total number of diet bottles = Number of diet bottles per oz / Number of oz per bottle

Total number of oz = Total number of regular oz + Total number of diet oz

Let's find the total number of bottles.

First, let's find the number of regular bottles:

Total number of regular oz = Number of regular bottles per oz * Number of regular bottles

Total number of regular oz = 492 oz
Number of regular bottles per oz = 1 / 12 bottles per oz

Solving for the number of regular bottles:

Total number of regular oz / (Number of regular bottles per oz * Number of regular bottles) = 492

492 = Number of regular bottles * (1 / 12)

Let's round down to the nearest integer:

Number of regular bottles = 40

Now, let's find the number of diet bottles:

Total number of diet oz = Number of diet bottles per oz * Number of diet bottles

Total number of diet oz = 264 oz
Number of diet bottles per oz = 1 / 12 bottles per oz

Solving for the number of diet bottles:

Total number of diet oz / (Number of diet bottles per oz * Number of diet bottles) = 264

264 = Number of diet bottles * (1 / 12)

Number of diet bottles = 22

Now, let's find how many shelves Jerry can fill up.

Number of bottles = Number of regular bottles + Number of diet bottles

40 + 22 = Number of shelves * 9

Let's round down to the nearest integer:

Number of shelves = (40 + 22) / 9

Number of shelves = 7

Therefore, Jerry can fill up 7 shelves in his fridge. As we round down, he may need to fill up one more shelf, but it is very unlikely as the number is close to 7. In the worst case, he might need to keep some extra bottles on the floor, but we assume his fridge cannot hold more than 9 shelves to save space.

{The final answer is} Jerry can fill up 7 shelves in his fridge.</s>",7

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this question, we can proceed as follows:

1. Let's represent the number of candies that Debby's sister has by x.

2. Debby had 32 pieces of candy, so we can write:

Debby: had 32 pieces of candy

3. We don't know how many candies Debby's sister had, but we know that the total number of candies they combined is 42. So, adding the number of candies that Debby's sister had to Debby's 32 candies, we get:

Total number of candies combined = 32 (from Debby) + x (from Debby's sister) = 42

4. On the first night, they ate 35 pieces of candy in total. We don't know how many candies each girl ate, but we can represent the number of candies Debby ate on the first night as a and the number of candies Debby's sister ate on the first night as b.

5. The number of candies they have left can be found by subtracting the number of candies they ate on the first night from the total number of candies they had combined.

6. Let's set up equations to represent what we know:

a + b = 35 (the total number of candies they ate on the first night)

32 + x = 42 (the total number of candies they combined)

7. Now, we can isolate the variables in the equations and simplify:

a = 35 - b (we don't yet know the value of b, but we'll solve for a in terms of b)

32 + x = 42 (simplify)

x = 42 - 32 (substitute 32 for Debby's number of candies)

x = 10

8. Let's substitute this value for x into the equation for the number of candies Debby had eaten on the first night:

a + 10 = 35

a = 25

9. Now that we have the number of candies Debby ate on the first night, we can find the number of candies Debby's sister ate on the first night by subtracting the number of candies Debby ate on the first night from the total number of candies they ate on the first night:

35 = a + b (total number of candies eaten on the first night)

25 = a (number of candies Debby ate on the first night)

b = 35 - 25 (number of candies Debby's sister ate on the first night)

b = 10

10. Finally, we can find out how many candies they have left by subtracting the number of candies they ate on the first night from the total number of candies they had combined:

Number of candies left = x + (32 - 25) (number of candies Debbie's sister has plus the remaining candies Debby has)

Number of candies left = 10 + 7 (number of candies left)

Number of candies left = 17

The final answer is: Debby and her sister have 17 candies left.</s>",39

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of small gardens Emily has. We can approach this by first finding the number of seeds Emily planted in the small gardens, then divide that by the number of seeds she planted in each small garden to get the number of small gardens.

Let x be the number of small gardens Emily has. We know she planted 4 seeds in each small garden, and she put the same number of small gardens into each of her small gardens.

In the small gardens, Emily planted a total of 41 - 29 = 12 seeds. Since she planted 4 seeds in each small garden and there are x small gardens, we have:

4 * x = 12

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 3

Therefore, Emily has 3 small gardens.

We can confirm this by checking that we have the correct number of seeds planted in the small gardens. Since she planted 4 seeds in each small garden, and she has 3 small gardens, we know she planted a total of 12 seeds in the small gardens (4 * 3 = 12). This matches the number of seeds we found earlier that she planted in the small gardens.

{The final answer is: Emily has 3 small gardens.}</s>",3

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many candies Emily has in total. We know she received 5 pieces from each neighbor and her older sister gave her 13 pieces, so she has a total of 5 times the number of neighbors she has and 13 pieces given by her older sister.

Let's let x be the number of neighbors Emily has. Then Emily's total number of candies is:

5x + 13 candies

Next, we need to find out how many candies Emily eats in one day. According to the problem, she eats 9 candies a day. Let's call this number y.

Now we can calculate how many days it would take for all of Emily's candy to run out. We can do this by setting up an equation to represent the situation:

Initial Candies - Candies Eaten Each Day = Candies Left

5x + 13 - y times the number of days it takes for the candy to run out = 0

To solve for the number of days, we first need to find a value for y using what we learned earlier about Emily's candy consumption. We know Emily eats 9 candies a day, so y is equal to 9:

5x + 13 - 9 times the number of days it takes for the candy to run out = 0

Let's simplify:

5x candies + 13 candies - 9 times the number of days left for the candy to last = 0

Now, we'll isolate the number of days left for the candy to last:

5x candies + 13 candies = 9 times the number of days left for the candy to last

Dividing both sides by 9:

(5x + 13) / 9 = number of days left for the candy to last

At this point, we have a rational expression in terms of our unknown quantities x, and we'd like to simplify it. At this point, we need to remember that when we divide by a negative quantity, the end result is undefined or not a real number. Let's make sure that x is not a negative number:

x >= 0

If the number of neighbors is not negative, this means that Emily's neighbors have given her a positive number of candies. If we assume that Emily's neighbors don't give out negative numbers of candies, we can simplify our equation further:

(5 * 0 + 13) / 9 = the number of days left for the candy to last

Let's simplify the expression 5 times x:

0 + 13 = 9 times the number of days left for the candy to last

Finally, we can plug in our values:

13 = 9 times the number of days left for the candy to last

Let's divide both sides by 9:

1.4444... Candies per day = number of days left for the candy to last

At this point, we can't simplify anymore, so our final answer is:

13 candies can last Emily 9 days if she eats 9 candies per day, she has no uneaten Halloween candy from her neighbors, she has eaten none of the candy her older sister gave her, and her older sister has given her 13 pieces.

In other words, we can't determine how long Emily's remaining Halloween candy would last her because she has not eaten any of her older sister's candy yet. When she has eaten all of her neighbors' candy and her older sister's candy, we can use our expression to calculate how many more days it would take until her remaining candy runs out.

The final answer is: 13 candies can last Emily 9 days if she eats 9 candies per day and she has received 5 times the number of neighbors she has and 13 pieces from her older sister and has eaten none of it.</s>",2

<|assistant|>
Step 1: Identify the unknown variables
In this problem, there are five unknown variables: n (the number of books Mike helps put away), m (the total number of books), x (the number of books the librarian takes), y (the number of books left for Mike), and z (the number of shelves Mike will need).

Step 2: Analyze the given information
We are given that there are 82 books to put away, 10 of which are taken by the librarian. Let's represent this as an equation:

m = 82
x = 10

We don't know the value of n or y, so we can't represent those as equations yet.

Step 3: Solve for x
Substitute the value of m - x into the equation for m:

m = 82
m - x = 72
72 = 82 - x
x = 82 - 72
x = 10

Check: 82 - 10 = 72, which confirms that x is 10.

Step 4: Solve for y
Using substitution, let's find y in terms of n:

n + x = y
n + 10 = y

Check: We know that y is the number of books left for Mike, and since we have represented it as a sum of n and x, it should also reflect how many books have been left over after the librarian takes x books away.

Step 5: Relate y and z
To find out how many shelves Mike will need, we need to find out how many shelfs are required to fit all the books that Mike helps put away and the ones that he is left with.
Let's represent the number of shelves required to fit the remaining books as z. If Mike can fit 9 books on a shelf, then the number of shelves required to fit y books is z where:

z = y / 9

Step 6: Find the value of z
Substitute the value of y, found in Step 4:

z = (n + 10) / 9

Step 7: Check for accuracy
Let's double check our answers by putting them back into the problem and seeing if they make sense.

82 books were available in the library, the librarian took away 10, leaving Mike with n + 10 books to put away, which amounts to z shelves (rounded up).

The final answer is: Mike needs z shelves to put away the books left by the librarian and the ones he helps put away.

{The final answer is: Mike needs z shelves to put away the books left by the librarian and the ones he helps put away.}

Step 8: Final check
Let's calculate z again, by substituting the values that we found for n and x:
z = (n + x) / 9

Check: z should be the same number that we calculated in Step 6 to confirm the correctness of our approach.</s>",8

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here's a step-by-step solution with clear reasoning:

1. We know that in total, there are 14 windows in the new building. Already, 8 of them have been installed. This means that the number of windows left to be installed is 14 - 8, which is 6. So, we have:

   Number of windows already installed = 8

   Number of windows left to be installed = 6

2. We also know that it takes 8 hours to install each window. Let's call the time needed to install the remaining 6 windows x. In other words, we're trying to find the value of x.

3. To calculate the total time needed to install all 14 windows, we can calculate the time needed to install the first 8 windows (which we already know) and the time needed to install the remaining 6 windows (which we're trying to find). So, we can write:

   Total time needed = Time needed for 8 windows + Time needed for 6 windows

4. Let's calculate the first part:

   Time needed for 8 windows = Number of windows x Time needed for each window

   First part = 8 x 8 = 64 hours

5. Now let's calculate the second part:

   Time needed for 6 windows = Number of windows x Time needed for each window

   Second part = 6 x x = 6x hours

6. Putting everything together, the total time needed to install all 14 windows is:

   Total time needed = 64 + 6x hours

7. We have one equation with two unknowns (the number of hours still needed to install the remaining 6 windows and the total time needed to install all the windows). To find a unique solution for x, we need another equation that relates these two unknowns.

8. Let's think about how the builder went about installing the windows. We're assuming that the builder works at a constant rate, so we know that if it takes him 8 hours to install 8 windows, it takes him the same amount of time to install 1 window. In other words:

   Time needed to install 1 window = Time needed to install 8 windows ÷ Number of windows

9. Let's calculate how many hours it takes the builder to install 1 window:

   Time needed to install 1 window = Time needed to install 8 windows ÷ Number of windows

   Time needed to install 1 window = 8 hours ÷ 8 windows = 1 hour

10. Now we can calculate how many hours it takes the builder to install the remaining 6 windows. The time needed is the same as the time needed to install 1 window (we know that the builder works at a constant rate), multiplied by the number of windows left to be installed:

   Time needed to install the remaining 6 windows = Number of windows left to be installed x Time needed to install 1 window

   Time needed to install the remaining 6 windows = 6 hours

11. But we already calculated the time needed to install the remaining 6 windows as part of the total time needed. Let's equate these two calculations:

   Time needed to install the remaining 6 windows (from previous step) = Time needed to install 6 windows from equation 5 (step 6)

   x = Time needed to install the remaining 6 windows

   x = 6 hours

12. We substitute the value of x into equation 5 (step 6) to see how many hours it takes to install all 14 windows:

   Total time needed = 64 + 6x hours

   Total time needed = 64 + 6(6) hours

   Total time needed = 392 hours

13. Therefore, in total, it takes 392 hours to install all 14 windows. This is our final answer, which we'll clearly indicate by appending it with {The final answer is}. The final answer is:

   Total time needed = 392 hours {The final answer is}.</s>",48

To solve this problem, let's represent the unknown variables with letters:

lettuce (L) represent the number of old oranges left after throwing away some of them
new (N) represent the number of new oranges added
remaining (R) represent the number of oranges in the bin after adding new oranges

step 1: Represent the initial number of oranges using the given information

40 = L

step 2: Represent the number of oranges thrown away

let's call this value x

x = L - 25 (Old oranges thrown away = L - 25)

step 3: Represent the number of new oranges added

let's call this value y

N = y

step 4: Find the value of L

L = 40 - x (Origional oranges minus the ones thrown away)

step 5: Represent the total number of oranges in the bin after adding new oranges

let's call this value R

R = L + N (Origional number of oranges + New number of oranges)

step 6: Solve for R

R = (40 - x) + y (Step 4 + 5)

step 7: Simplify

R = 40 - x + y (Combined step 4 and 5)

step 8: Substitute values of x and y

R = 40 - (40 - 25) + 21 (Substitute the values from steps 2 and 3)

step 9: Simplify

R = 16 (Combine like terms)

<|assistant|>
We can split the 7 customers into two groups: those who left a tip (2) and those who didn't (5). Let's call the tip left by each customer in the first group T.

The waiter earned tip money from the customers in the first group. Each customer left a tip of T dollars, so in total the tip left by the first group was 2T dollars. The waiter did not earn any tips from the customers in the second group because they did not leave any.

The total amount spent by the customers was the cost of the meals (C) plus the tips (2T). We know that the waiter charged each customer in the first group C dollars for their meal, and each customer in the second group also paid C dollars for their meal.

Since there were 2 customers in the first group and 5 customers in the second group, the total amount spent by all customers was:

[(2 customers in the first group) * (C dollars per customer)] + [(5 customers in the second group) * (C dollars per customer)] + [(2 customers in the first group) * (T dollars per customer)]

Evaluating this expression, we get:

2C + 5C + 2T

Simplifying this expression, we get:

7C + 2T

Now let's consider the waiter's earnings. As mentioned earlier, the waiter earned tip money from the customers in the first group in the amount of 2T dollars. Each customer in the first group left a tip of T dollars, so the waiter earned T dollars from customer 1, T dollars from customer 2, and zero dollars from the other customers in the first group.

For the customers in the second group, the waiter charged each one C dollars for their meal, and received nothing in tips from these customers since they did not leave any.

Using this information, we can calculate the waiter's earnings:

[Customer 1: $C for meal, $T in tips] + [Customer 2: $C for meal, $T in tips] + [Customer 3: $C for meal, $0 in tips] + [Customer 4: $C for meal, $0 in tips] + [Customer 5: $C for meal, $0 in tips] + [Customer 6: $C for meal, $0 in tips] + [Customer 7: $C for meal, $0 in tips]

To make this calculation easier to follow, let's break it into two parts. We will first calculate the waiter's earnings from the customers in the first group and then the earnings from the customers in the second group. This calculation results in:

[(Customer 1: $C for meal, $T in tips) + (Customer 2: $C for meal, $T in tips)] - [Zero dollars in tips from the rest of the customers in the first group]

This calculation gives us the earnings of the waiter from the customers in the first group. We can substitute this calculation into the waiter's earnings calculation that we made earlier.

[(Customer 1: $C for meal, $T in tips) + (Customer 2: $C for meal, $T in tips)] - [Zero dollars in tips from the rest of the customers in the first group] + [Customer 3: $C for meal, $0 in tips] + [Customer 4: $C for meal, $0 in tips] + [Customer 5: $C for meal, $0 in tips] + [Customer 6: $C for meal, $0 in tips] + [Customer 7: $C for meal, $0 in tips]

Now we're ready to substitute the known values into the final earnings calculation:

[(Customer 1: $7 for meal, $T in tips) + (Customer 2: $7 for meal, $T in tips)] - [Zero dollars in tips from the rest of the customers in the first group] + [Customer 3: $7 for meal, $0 in tips] + [Customer 4: $7 for meal, $0 in tips] + [Customer 5: $7 for meal, $0 in tips] + [Customer 6: $7 for meal, $0 in tips] + [Customer 7: $7 for meal, $0 in tips]

Putting this all together, the waiter's total earnings were:

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of subtraction and addition. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. After the first night, Faye has 47 - 25 = 22 pieces of candy remaining.

2. Her sister then gives her an additional 40 pieces.

3. Now, Faye has a total of 22 + 40 = 62 pieces of candy.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find out how many chicken wings each of the four friends gets, we need to first find out how many chicken wings were cooked in total. We know that the chef had 9 chicken wings before the group arrived, and then he cooked 7 more chicken wings for the group of four friends. Thus, the total number of chicken wings cooked is 9 + 7 = 16.

Now, let's assume that each friend gets the same number of chicken wings. Let x be the number of chicken wings each friend gets. Then, we can set up an equation to represent the situation where the total number of chicken wings divided by the number of friends equals the number of chicken wings each friend gets:

16 ÷ 4 = x

Simplifying this equation,

x = 4

Therefore, each friend gets 4 chicken wings, since the total number of chicken wings divided by the number of friends equals 4. So, {Each friend gets 4 chicken wings.}</s>",4

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow the given steps:

1. John earns $8 for mowing each lawn. Let's represent the number of lawns mowed by x.
2. We know that John had 15 lawns to mow in total. Out of these, 7 lawns were forgotten to be mowed.
3. The number of lawns left to mow, after subtracting the forgotten ones, is 15 - 7 = 8. Let's represent this by y.
4. John mowed y number of remaining lawns, so the total number of lawns mowed is x + y.
5. Amount earned by mowing x lawns is x * $8 = $8x.
6. Amount earned by mowing y lawns is y * $8 = $8y.
7. Total amount earned by John is the sum of the amount earned by mowing x and y lawns.
8. The total amount earned by John is: ($8x$ + $8y$) dollars = $8(x + y)$ dollars.
9. Using step 2 in our calculation, we know that the total number of lawns to be mowed was 15. So, the total number of lawns mowed by John is x + y = 15.
10. We know that out of 15 lawns, only 8 were mowed on time, so the number of lawns John forgot to mow is $15 - 8 = 7$.
11. Let's find out the number of lawns John mowed after forgetting. It's equal to the total number of lawns mowed minus the number of lawns John forgot to mow. $x + y = 15$
12. It follows that $8 - 7 = x - y$.
13. To transform the above equation, we have to add 'y' to both sides of the equation, we get: $5 = 8x$, then $x = 5/8$.
14. After substituting $x = 5/8$ into our total earning equation, it comes to: $E = 8(5/8 + y)$, where 'E' denotes how much money John earned, '$x$' denotes how many lawns were mowed at the right time, and '$y$' denotes how many lawns were mowed after forgetting.
15. Putting the value of 'x' in Step 14: $E = 8(5/8 + y) = 10 + 8y$ dollars.
16. We can find 'y' by substituting Step 10 in the above equation: $E = 10 + 8(15 - 8 + y) = 120 + 64 + 64y$ dollars.
17. Using Step 3, we substitute 'y' to simplify the equation: $E = 184 - 64(7-x) / (7-x)$ dollars, where 'x' is the number of the lawns that were mowed at the right time.
18. The final answer is: The amount John earned, (based on Step 17), is $184 - 64(7-x) / (7-x)$ dollars.

                    {The final answer is: The amount John earned, (based on Step 17), is $184 - 64(7-x) / (7-x)$ dollars.}

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps and calculate each part separately, then combine the results at the end. Here's how:

1. Determine the initial number of puppies at the shelter:
   - There are x puppies when y more puppies are brought in.
   - When y is subtracted from x, we get the original number of puppies before the new batch arrived.
   - x - y = 5 (the original number of puppies)
   - y = 35 (the number of puppies brought in)
   - Substitute y into the equation to find x:
       x = 35 + 5 = 40 puppies

2. Calculate the total number of puppies at the shelter:
   - The total number of puppies is the sum of the initial number and the newly arrived batch:
       Total puppies = 40 + 35
       Total puppies = 75 puppies

3. Calculate the rate of adoption (puppies/day) based on the given information of 8 puppies being adopted per day:
   - Define r as the rate of adoption, in terms of puppies per day:
       r = 8 (puppies/day)

4. Calculate the time it takes to adopt all the puppies using the rate of adoption:
   - Let t be the time it takes to adopt all the puppies, in terms of days:
       All puppies adopted = Total puppies (at the shelter)
       All puppies adopted = 75 (puppies)
       All puppies adopted = 75 * r (puppies/day)
       All puppies adopted = (75 (puppies)) / t (days)
   - We can find t by isolating it:
       t = 75 / r (days)
       t = 75 / 8 (days)
       t = 9.375 days (to the nearest hundredth of a day)

In summary:

- The pet shelter had 40 puppies originally, then 35 more arrived.
- There are currently 75 puppies at the shelter.
- Eight puppies are being adopted per day.
- It will take approximately 9.38 days to adopt all the puppies at this rate. 

Our final answer is:

{The final answer is: Approximately 9.38 days}

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
1. We are given that a new building needed 9 windows (let's call this expression W). Six of those windows have already been installed (let's call this expression I), leaving us with the number of remaining windows to be installed (let's call this expression R). 

2. We can set up a system of equations to represent this information.

W = I + R

3. Substituting the known values, we get:

9 = 6 + R

4. Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:

3 = R

5. Now, let's find out how long it takes to install one window (let's call this expression T). The builder takes 6 hours to install one window (let's call this expression X), so the time it takes to install the remaining windows (which, as we've discovered, is equal to 3) is:

T = X * 3

6. We don't have a direct formula for finding X, since we don't know how long it takes to install the remaining windows. However, we do know that it takes 6 hours to install one window. To find out X, we can divide the number of hours taken to install six windows (let's call this expression B) by the number of installed windows (6).

X = B / 6

7. Let's find out the value of B. The builder installs the six initial windows in a total time of X * 6 hours. Since X represents the number of hours it takes to install one window, we can find B by finding the total time it takes to install the six initial windows:

B = X * 6

8. We also know the total time it takes to install each window (let's call this expression H). We can calculate it by dividing the number of hours taken to install one window (X) by the number of hours it takes to install each window (T).

H = X / T

9. Using the formula we found in step 7, we can find the value of B:

B = X * 6 = H * T * 6

10. Simplifying the expression and isolating T:

T = (B / 6) / H

11. Putting all together, we can find the time it takes to install the remaining windows by substituting the values we've found previously into the expression for T.

The final answer is: {T = ((6 * H) / I) / (H - X)} hours to install the remaining windows.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the process of combining like terms, which involves adding or subtracting algebraic expressions that have the same variable and exponent.

First, let's identify the values of the unknown quantities. The teacher originally had 34 worksheets to grade. She graded 7 worksheets initially and an additional 36 worksheets were turned in, bringing the total number of worksheets to grade to an unknown quantity.

Let x represent the total number of worksheets the teacher had to grade. Then, we can write the following equations to represent the situation:

x = 34      (1)
x - 7 = 36    (2)

To find x, we need to solve equation (2) for x and then substitute this value into equation (1).

Beginning by solving equation (2), we can isolate x by adding 7 to both sides of the equation:

x = 36 + 7   (3)

Next, we want to get x as the only term with an x on the left side of the equation. To do this, we can undo the addition we did in step 3 by subtracting 36 from both sides of the equation:

x - 36 = 7   (4)

Now, we have an equation where x is isolated. To find the value of x, we can substitute our known values into equation (4). In this case, we know that the number of worksheets originally given to the teacher was 34, and the additional number turned in was 36. Substituting these values into equation (4) gives us:

34 - 36 = 7

We can see that this result doesn't make sense, since it means that the teacher originally had a negative number of worksheets. However, this is a common mistake when working with equations with multiple steps involving adding and subtracting.

One thing we're forgetting is that we're not actually subtracting the original number of worksheets from the total number turned in. Instead, we're simply adjusting our viewpoint and looking at the additional worksheets in terms of the original number of worksheets.

To correct this mistake, we can use equation (1) to represent the total number of worksheets turned in, and subtract this quantity from equation (2) to find a new equation:

x = 34 - (x - 36)     (5)

Distributing the parentheses in equation (5) and collecting like terms, we have:

x - x + 36 = 34 - 36

Combining like terms, we get:

0 = -2

Again, this result doesn't make sense, since there's no real number solution for negative 2. However, let's remember that we're currently making an assumption that we can subtract x from itself in equation (5). This is like subtracting zero from a number, and doesn't actually change the value of the number. Essentially, we're using the same value twice in a subtraction.

To correct this second mistake, we can add x to both sides of equation (5) and simplify:

x + x = 34 + (x - 36)

Now distributing the x's on the left side and collecting terms gives us:

2x = 34 - 36

Using our previous knowledge, we can simplify to:

2x = -2

Dividing both sides by 2 reveals our final answer:

x = -1     (6)

This result doesn't make sense, since it's not possible for the teacher to have a negative number of worksheets to grade. However, this is a common mistake that occurs when we try to subtract an unknown value from itself in a subtraction.

Instead, let's think again about our situation. We originally had 34 worksheets to grade, and then an additional 36 were turned in, bringing the total number of worksheets to grade to an unknown value x. Now, our goal is to find the value of x.

We can represent this situation in terms of systems of equations. One way to do this is to write our two known equations (1) and (2) as a system:

x = 34          (7)

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Frank won a total of 42 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball' combined. This can be calculated by summing the number of tickets won from each game:

   - Frank won 33 tickets playing 'whack a mole.'
   - The problem doesn't specify how many tickets Frank won playing 'skee ball,' so let's call that number x.

   - 33 tickets for 'whack a mole' + x tickets for 'skee ball' = 42 total tickets.

   - Solving for x:

   - 33 + x = 42
   - Subtracting 33 from both sides:

   - 0 + x = 9
   - Simplifying:

   - x = 9

   - Therefore, Frank won 9 tickets playing 'skee ball.'

2. Now, we know that each candy costs 6 tickets. Our goal is to find out how many candies Frank could buy with the total number of tickets he won (42 in total).

   - Let's call the number of candies Frank could buy y.

   - If Frank spends all 42 tickets on candies, each candy will cost roughly 1 ticket (42 tickets / y candies = 6 tickets per candy).

   - We can set up an equation to calculate y:

   - 42 = y * 6

   - Solving for y:

   - 42 ÷ 6 = y

   - Simplifying:

   - y = 7

   - Therefore, Frank could buy 7 candies with the total number of tickets he won (42).

   - To put it all together, Frank won 33 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 9 tickets playing 'skee ball,' for a total of 42 tickets. With each candy costing 6 tickets, Frank could buy 7 candies with his winnings from the arcade. 

   - The final answer is: Frank could buy 7 candies with the total number of tickets he won (42).

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first identify the number of adults and kids in the group. Since a total of 13 people came in and 9 of them were kids, we can set up an equation to find the number of adults:

number of adults = total number of people - number of kids
number of adults = 13 - 9
number of adults = 4

Now we have the number of adults and kids, we can find the amount each adult spent on their meal and the total amount spent by the kids on their free meals.

amount spent by adults = number of adults × cost per adult meal
amount spent by adults = 4 × $7 = $28

amount spent by kids = number of kids × cost per adult meal (as meals for kids are free, we'll assume that they're getting meals valued at $7)
amount spent by kids = 9 × $7 = $63

total amount spent by the group = amount spent by adults + amount spent by kids
total amount spent by the group = $28 + $63 = $91

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find the number of math and science problems that Paige has left to do for homework, we can break down the problem into a few simpler sub-problems.

1. Paige had 43 math problems and 12 science problems for homework initially. This means she had a total of 43 math problems and 12 science problems, or 55 problems in total. We can represent this with an addition formula:

    Total problems = Math problems + Science problems
    Total problems = 43 + 12
    Total problems = 55

2. Paige finished 44 math problems at school. This means she still has some left to do for homework. We can find these remaining math problems by subtracting the 44 math problems that she completed at school from the total math problems that she originally had:

    Math problems left for homework = Original math problems - Math problems completed at school
    Math problems left for homework = 43 - 44
    Math problems left for homework = -1

    Notice that the resulting expression (-1) is not a realistic value - there cannot be a negative number of homework problems! This means that we made an error in our calculations and we need to revisit our thought process. We should ask ourselves, ""Why did we get -1?"" It sounds like we took away more math problems than Paige had originally. So we should double-check whether we added everything up correctly.

3. Let's calculate the total number of math problems that Paige has completed so far (by adding the 44 at school to the ones she originally had).

    Math problems completed = Math problems completed at school + Original math problems
    Math problems completed = 44 + 43
    Math problems completed = 87

4. Comparing this value to the total number of math problems we calculated before shows that we must have made an error. According to our calculations, Paige should have a total of 87 math problems completed and 55 in total. This means we only have 32 math problems that she has not finished yet (since 87 and 55 add up to 142, and we know she originally had 43 and has completed 44, so there are 32 left over). This is more consistent with our knowledge that there cannot be negative values for remaining problems.

5. With the math problems corrected, let's calculate the total homework problems that she has left. We can do this by finding the difference between the total problems she had originally and the ones she has completed.

    Homework problems left = Total homework problems - Completed homework problems
    Homework problems left = 55 - 87
    Homework problems left = -32

    Once again, we should notice that we are getting a negative value, which cannot be correct. This means we must have made another error, as the number of remaining problems should be a positive integer.

6. Let's calculate the total number of homework problems that Paige has completed so far by adding the math and science problems together.

    Completed homework problems = Math problems completed + Science problems completed
    Completed homework problems = 87 + 4
    Completed homework problems = 91

7. If we compare this value to the total homework problems, we can find the number of homework problems that she still has yet to do:

    Homework problems left = Total homework problems - Completed homework problems
    Homework problems left = 55 - 91
    Homework problems left = -36

    Again, we are getting a negative value, so our math is wrong.

8. Let's check our calculations to see where we might have gone wrong. How many science problems did Paige complete at school? If we assume that she completed all of them (which could certainly be the case), then we can calculate that:

    Science problems completed = Science problems originally - Science problems left for homework
    Science problems completed = 12 - 0
    Science problems completed = 12

9. Now let's double-check that this total number of completed problems matches what we found earlier:

    Completed homework problems = Math problems completed + Science problems completed
    Completed homework problems = 87 + 12
    Completed homework problems = 99

10. When we compare this value to our total number of completed homework problems before, we find that there are still quite a few problems left to do. Since we assumed that she",11

Step 1: Identify the unknown

In this problem, we want to find out how many of the 27 customers left a tip. Let's call this number x.

Step 2: Create an equation

As we know that a total of 26 customers were already being served when the lunch rush started, and another 27 customers joined during the rush. This makes a total of 53 customers, excluding tips.

Now, we know that 27 of these 53 customers did not leave a tip, while the remaining x customers did leave a tip. This means that those who didn't leave a tip paid their total bill (excluding tips), while those who left tips paid slightly more, with the tips added to their bill.

Let's create an equation to represent this scenario.

Let b be the total bill for each customer (excluding tips), and t be the tip left by each customer who did leave a tip.

Then, we can say that:

27 customers did not leave a tip, so they each paid b.

X customers left a tip, so they each paid b + t.

The combined bill for all 53 customers is:

27 customers did not leave a tip at all: 27 * b = $27b

X customers left a tip: x * (b + t) = $x(b + t)

Total bill: $27b + $x(b + t) (after adding the tips)

Step 3: Find an expression for the total bill

We know that the total bill for all 53 customers (inclusive of tips) is $53b + $x(b + t) (where b is the base price of each meal, t is the tip left by the customers who left a tip, and x is the number of those customers).

Let's find an expression for the number of customers who did leave a tip.

X = 53 - 27 = 26

Now, since the base price of each meal is b and the tips left by the 26 customers who did leave a tip is t (expressed as a fraction of their total bill), we can say that the total amount of tips left by the 26 customers is:

T = 0.26 * 26 * (b + t)

Step 4: Express the total bill (inclusive of tips) as a function of the base price per meal (b) and tips (t)

Using the expressions we have found, we can write the total bill (inclusive of tips) as a function of b and t as follows:

53 * b + 26 * (b + t) - 0.26 * 26 * (b + t) = $TotalBill(b, t)

Step 5: Calculate the final answer

Using algebraic solutions, we can find out the exact values of b and t that would result in the total bill being $1,585.

Note that both variables cannot take negative values, so we need to make sure that the values we calculate make sense.

Substituting $1,585 for the total bill gives:

$1,585 = $TotalBill(b, t)

Let's solve for t:

26 * (b + t) - 0.26 * 26 * (b + t) = 53 * b

Let's simplify by grouping like terms:

(-0.74 * 26) * (b + t) + 26 * (b + t) = 53 * b

Let's group everything in parentheses:

26 * (-0.74 + 1) * (b + t) = 53 * b

Let's simplify:

b = \dfrac {26 * 0.26} {1 - 0.74} * t

b = \dfrac {6.69} {0.26} * t

Now, we have an expression for b as a function of t, which seems to be what we are looking for.

We can say that:

b = \dfrac {6.69} {0.26} * $0.26 = $256.54 per customer (excluding tips).

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Find the number of mystery books on each shelf (4).

Step 2: Multiply the number of mystery shelves (5) by the number of mystery books per shelf (4) to find the total number of mystery books (20).

Step 3: Write an equation to find the number of picture books on each shelf (x).

   x shelfs x x books/shelf = 3 x ?

Step 4: Simplify the equation using algebraic operations.

   x x ? = 3 x ?

Step 5: Divide both sides by the number of picture book shelves (x) to obtain the number of picture books on each shelf.

   ? = 3

Step 6: Find the total number of picture books by multiplying the number of picture books shelves (x) by the number of picture books on each shelf (3).

   x x 3 = 9

Step 7: Add the total number of mystery books (20) and picture books (9) to find the total number of books (Gwen had).

   Total number of books = 20 + 9

   Total number of books = 29

The final answer is: Gwen had a total of 29 books.

Alternatively, you can also calculate the total number of books by adding the number of books on all the shelves. 

   Number of mystery books = 5 x 4 = 20

   Number of picture books = 3 x 3 = 9

   Total number of books = 20 + 9 = 29

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's first find the number of pictures left over after Wendy put 44 into one album. We know that she put a total of 79 pictures onto Facebook, so we can set up an equation to find the unknown number of pictures:

79 = 44 (number of pictures in 1 album) + (number of pictures left over)

We can use the variable x to represent the number of pictures left over:

79 = 44 + x

Next, let's find out how many albums have x or more pictures. We know that Wendy put the remaining pictures into 5 different albums, so the total number of pictures in those five albums should be x or more. However, we don't know how many pictures are in each album. Let's use a new variable, y, to represent the number of pictures in each of these five albums. We don't yet know how many pictures there are in each album, but we do know that there are a total of 5 albums, and each album contains y or more pictures. 

Now we have two equations. The first is for the number of pictures in the first album:

44 = y

This tells us that the first album contains exactly 44 pictures. The second equation is for the total number of pictures in the five other albums that contain x or more pictures:

5y = x

Lastly, we can see that Wendy put all 79 pictures onto Facebook, so the total number of pictures must be the same as the number Wendy uploaded. This is our final equation:

79 = 44 + x + 5y

Let's use the previous two equations to substitute y and 44 into this final equation:

79 = 44 + x + 5(y)

We can then solve for x, which is the number of pictures left over:

79 = 44 + 5y + x

79 - 44 = 5y + x

35 = 5y + x

We can use equation two to substitute y with x/5. This will allow us to eliminate the variable y:

x/5 = x/5

Now we substitute the expression for x/5 into our first equation:

44 = x + (5)(x/5)

44 = 6x/5

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:

220 = 30x

Finally, we can divide both sides by 30 to get our answer:

x = 7 (rounded up)

So, how many pictures were in each of the five remaining albums? We know that each album contains x or more pictures, and we found out earlier that x is 7. Therefore, every one of those albums contains at least 7 pictures. 

In summary, Wendy put 79 pictures onto Facebook. She put 44 pictures into one album and the remaining 7 pictures (x) were divided into 5 other albums, with at least 7 pictures in each album. The {The final answer is} should be:

Every one of those five albums contains at least 7 pictures, and the total number of pictures in those albums is 35 or more.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Let x be the number of boys in each group.
2. Since the debate team had 5 boys in total, we know that x times the number of groups must be equal to 5.
3. Let y be the number of girls in each group.
4. Since the debate team had 40 girls in total, we know that y times the number of groups must be equal to 40.
5. We want to find out how many groups can be made if they are split into groups of 9.

Using these steps, let's create a system of equations:

x times number of groups = 5 (number of boys)
y times number of groups = 40 (number of girls)
9 (number of people in each group) = x + y (number of people in each group equals 9)

Substituting y in terms of x in the second equation, we get:

x times number of groups = 5
(9 - x) times number of groups = 40

We can now solve for x in terms of number of groups:

x = 5/(Number of Groups)
(9 - x) = 40/(Number of Groups)

Solving the second equation for x, we get:

x = 5/(Number of Groups)
9 - 5/(Number of Groups) = 40/(Number of Groups)
Solving for the number of groups, we see that such a group division is not possible since the left-hand side would be greater than the right-hand side:

5/(Number of Groups) + 4(Number of Groups) < 9

Therefore, it is not possible to split the debate team into groups of 9, as it would result in conflicting group sizes for boys and girls.

{The final answer is: It is not possible to split the debate team into groups of 9, as it would result in conflicting group sizes for boys and girls.}</s>",5

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use a table to keep track of the number of roses and their cost as April's stock changes.

| roses | cost per rose | total cost | remaining roses |
|-------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| 9     | $7          | $63           | 5               |
| 5     | $7          | $35           | 0               |

At the beginning, April has 9 roses, each of which costs $7, for a total cost of $63. After she sells 4 of these roses, she is left with 5 roses with a total cost of $35. Because we know that the number of roses (and their cost) have changed, we cannot simply use the beginning and ending quantities to find her profit.

To find her total earnings, we need to add the remaining cost of the roses to her profit from the sale of the additional roses. We calculated the cost of the remaining roses (which she is willing to sell at a discount):

Remaining roses cost: $35
Sale price of remaining roses: $28 (25% discount)
Total profit from remaining roses: $7 (original cost - sale price)

She sold the additional 4 roses at a reduced price because of the sale. For simplicity, let's assume April sold each of these roses for $5.

Cost of the additional roses: $28
Sale price of additional roses: $20 each (20 roses)
Total profit from additional roses: $40 (original cost - sale price)

Adding the total profit from both types of roses gives us April's total earnings for this sale:

Total profit: $7 + $40 = $47

Final answer: The final answer is $47, which is the total profit April earned during this sale.

Note: In practice, we would not recommend solving these types of problems by hand, as the final answer would require us to manually calculate the costs and prices of more than 20 individual flowers. To more efficiently calculate quantities and price changes at scale, using a software solution or a more formal mathematical approach would be more practical. However, working problems with small datasets can be a helpful exercise in understanding calculations involving quantity and price.</s>",35

Step 1: Identify the given information

- The trivia team had a total of a certain number of members, which we'll call ""x.""
- During a specific game, ""y"" members did not show up, leaving ""x - y"" members to participate.
- Each participating member scored ""c"" points, and this group collectively scored ""z"" points total.

Step 2: Find the number of members who showed up

- The total number of members is ""x.""
- The number of members who did not show up is ""y.""
- The number of members who did show up is ""x - y.""
- Substitute the x, y, and c values into the formula ""x - y"" to solve for the number of members who showed up:
      x - y = x - y
      Solution: The number of members who showed up is ""x - y.""

Step 3: Find the points scored by members who did not show up

- The trivia team had a total of ""x"" members.
- ""y"" of these members did not show up to the specific game being considered.
- Each of these missing members scored ""c"" points.
- Substitute the x, y, and c values into the formula ""yc"" to find the total number of points scored by the members who did not show up:
      yc = yc
      Solution: The total number of points scored by the members who did not show up is ""yc.""

Step 4: Find the total points scored

- The participating members of the team scored ""c"" points each.
- ""x - y"" of these members did show up and participated in the game, scoring ""c""points each.
- Substitute the c, x, and y values into the formula ""(x - y)c"" to find the total number of points scored by these participating members:
      (x - y)c = (x - y)c
      Solution: The total number of points scored by the participating members is ""(x - y)c.""
- The missing members did not participate, but each scored ""c"" points, as calculated previously.
- Substitute the y and c values into the formula ""yc"" to find the total number of points scored by missing members:
      Solution: The total number of points scored by missing members is ""yc.""
- Combine the previous calculation of the missing members' points and the calculated points scored by participating members:
      (x - y)c + yc
      (We used parentheses for clarity, but they are not necessary since there are no operators within them.)
      Solution: The total points scored is ""z.""

Step 5: Confirm the total points scored matches the calculated value

- The total points should be equal to the original question's request for the total points scored:

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the numbers of Siamese cats and house cats as variables S and H, respectively. Then, let F be the original number of all cats in the store (Siamese and house cats combined), and let N be the number of cats sold during the sale.

We can set up a system of linear equations with these variables to represent the initial and final states of the store:

F = S + H
13 = S
5 = H

After the sale, there are now F - N cats left in the store. We can set up another equation to represent this:

F - N = S + H - 10

We can substitute the values we know for S and H into this equation and solve for F (with N known from the initial problem). The final answer will be indicated by ending the solution with {The final answer is}.

Here are the steps of our reasoning:

1. To begin with, we can set up the initial system of equations:

F = S + H
13 = S
5 = H

2. Solve for S:

13 = S
S = 13

3. Substitute this value for S into the first equation:

F = 13 + H

4. Solve for H:

5 = H
H = 5

5. Substitute these values for S and H into the initial equation for F to find the total number of cats before the sale:

F = 13 + 5
F = 18

{The total number of cats before the sale is 18}.

6. Set up the equation to represent the number of cats left after the sale:

F - N = S + H - 10

7. Substitute the values found previously for S, H, and F into this equation:

F - N = 13 + 5 - 10

8. Simplify the expression:

F - N = 8

9. We now have an equation with F and N unknowns. Since we know that N = 10 (from the statement in the problem), we can substitute this into the equation found in step 8:

F - 10 = 8

10. Solve for F:

F = 8 + 10
F = 18

{The number of cats remaining in the store after the sale is 18}.

11. Double-check that the final answer is reasonable. When we set all the variables to their final values, we should get the number of cats initially reported (18):

F = S + H
F = 13 + 5
F = 18

This matches the initial number of cats, so our solution is valid.

{The final number of cats in the store is 18}.</s>",8

{The final answer is:} y = x + 33. In other words, the total number of socks Sam has is equal to the initial number of socks he had, x, plus 33.

To find the specific value of y, we need to know the initial value of x. Let's assume x is 50.

Plugging this value into our equation, we can find the final number of socks:

y = x + 33

y = 50 + 33

y = 83

So, in the assumed scenario, Sam would have 83 socks in total.

Answer: {The final answer is:} y = x + 33. To find the exact final number of socks, we need to know the initial number, which is represented by x. Substituting a specific value for x (such as 50) would allow us to calculate y.</s>",43

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break this problem down into smaller, more manageable steps. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to solve it:

1. Wendy picked a total of 103 flowers for her friend's wedding. She used 8 flowers in each bouquet, so we can split up the total number of flowers into bouquets:

103 flowers ÷ 8 flowers per bouquet = approximately 12.9 flowers remaining (rounded down to the nearest whole number) after making all the bouquets

2. Unfortunately, 47 of those remaining flowers wilted before the wedding, leaving Wendy with 8 flowers remaining that she could use to make more bouquets:

12 flowers remaining - 47 wilted flowers = 8 flowers remaining

3. We're trying to find out how many more bouquets Wendy could still make with these 8 remaining flowers. First, we need to figure out how many bouquets Wendy made before the wilted flowers:

Number of bouquets before wilting = 103 flowers picked - (number of flowers in each bouquet times the number of bouquets with those flowers)

103 flowers picked - (8 flowers per bouquet times the number of bouquets) = 8 flowers left over

8 flowers left over = 8 flowers per bouquet times the number of bouquets

Rearrange and solve for the number of bouquets:

Number of bouquets = (8 flowers per bouquet)÷(8 flowers left over÷8 flowers per bouquet)

Number of bouquets = 103 flowers picked÷8 flowers per bouquet = 13 bouquets (rounded down to the nearest whole number)

4. After the wiltage, Wendy had 8 flowers remaining that she could still use to make more bouquets. Let's call the number of additional bouquets she could make n. We can write an equation using the information we have:

8 remaining flowers = 8 flowers per bouquet times n additional bouquets

This equation tells us that the total number of flowers used in n additional bouquets is the number of flowers in each bouquet times the number of additional bouquets. Set up a fraction using this equation that shows how many of these remaining flowers will go into each of these new bouquets:

8 remaining flowers / (8 flowers per bouquet times n additional bouquets) = number of remaining flowers per new bouquet

Simplify this fraction to calculate the number of remaining flowers per new bouquet:

8 / (8 flowers per bouquet times n additional bouquets) = number of remaining flowers per new bouquet

Multiply both the numerator and denominator by n to get rid of the fraction:

8 * n / (8 flowers per bouquet times n times n) = number of remaining flowers per new bouquet

Simplify this expression to get the number of remaining flowers per new bouquet:

Number of remaining flowers per new bouquet = 1 / (n times n)

5. Now, we finally have enough information to figure out how many total bouquets Wendy could make in the end:

Total bouquets = Number of bouquets before wilting + N additional bouquets

Total number of bouquets = 13 bouquets before wilting + N additional bouquets

Substitute our expression for the number of remaining flowers per new bouquet into this equation:

Total bouquets = 8 * 13 / (n times n) + n

Simplify this expression to get the final answer:

Total bouquets = (8 * 13)(n + 1)/(n * n)

In summary, Wendy could make approximately (8 * 13)(n + 1) bouquets in total (rounded up to the nearest whole number). The final answer is:

{The final answer is approximately (8 * 13)(n + 1)/(n * n), where n is the number of additional bouquets Wendy could make with the remaining 8 flowers that didn't wilt.}</s>",7

<|assistant|>
Let x be the number of books Adam sold.

Adam had 48 books in total.

After selling x books, Adam is left with 48 - x books.

The price Adam receives for selling each book is not specified, so we cannot easily determine how much he earned from selling x books. However, we know that he used the money he earned to buy 38 new books.

Let y be the price Adam earned per book.

Let y * 38 be the total amount Adam spent on the new books.

Let y * x be the total amount Adam earned from selling x books.

Adam's new total number of books after buying the new books is: (48 - x) + 38

Assuming Adam's original books and newly bought books have the same price per book, we can find an expression for the price per book.

The price per book is y.

The total price Adam paid for his original 48 books is: 48 * y

The total price Adam spent on the new books is: y * 38

Adding these two prices together gives us the total amount Adam spent on all his books.

Let t be the total amount Adam spent on all his books.

t = 48 * y + y * 38

We also know that t is equal to the amount Adam earned from selling x books.

t = y * x

Putting this together, we have:

48 * y + y * 38 = y * x

Let's isolate y in terms of x.

y = (48 * x) / (38 - x)

Now that we have an expression for y, we can substitute it into our original expression for the number of new books purchased using Adam's earnings.

Let s be the number of new books Adam bought.

s = (48 * x) / (38 - x) * 38

Let's simplify this expression:

s = 132 * x / (38 - x)

Finally, combining the expressions for Adam's remaining books and the number of new books he bought, we can find the total number of books Adam has.

Adam's total number of books is: (48 - x) + 132 * x / (38 - x)

{The final answer is: (48 - x) + 132 * x / (38 - x)}</s>",67

<|assistant|>
To find out how many vans are needed for Nancy's class to go on a field trip to the zoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how many people are going in total. As the problem gives us the number of students (12) and adults (3), we can add them up:

   Total people = 12 students + 3 adults
   Total people = 15

2. Next, we know that each van can hold 5 people. Since we want to find the number of vans required, we need to divide the total number of people by 5, the number of people each van can hold. However, as we need to find out whole number of vans required, we'll round up to get the most number of vans:

   Number of vans required = Total people ÷ 5
   Number of vans required = 15 ÷ 5
   Number of vans required = 3

3. Therefore, to conclude, we need three vans to carry the total number of 15 people from Nancy's class on the field trip to the zoo.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how many regular and diet sodas Tom bought in total.

We know that Tom bought 4 regular sodas for his birthday party. Let's call this number r. So, r is the number of regular sodas Tom bought. We also know that Tom bought 52 diet sodas for his birthday party. Let's call this number d.

We can find the number of regular sodas, r, in terms of d as follows:

 tom bought r regular sodas and 52 - r diet sodas for his birthday party.

The total number of sodas Tom bought is the sum of the number of regular sodas and diet sodas. 

total number of sodas = r + (52 - r)

simplifying the above expression, we get:

total number of sodas = 52

total number of sodas = 52

r + 52 - r = 52

0 = 52 - r             { subtracting r from both sides }

this implies that r = 52.

but we can't have decimals or negative values for the number of sodas. So, we know that 52 isn't realistic. It's possible that there's an arithmetic mistake in the question that led us to believe that tom bought 52 diet sodas in reality.

to check if our method is correct, let's suppose that tom bought 48 diet sodas instead of 52. This means that the total number of sodas is 48 + r.

let's calculate the number of regular sodas r based on how many shelves will fit in his fridge. His fridge can hold only 7 sodas on each shelf. Let's call this number n.

tom bought 4 regular sodas, and we want to know how many shelves will he fill up entirely with regular sodas. We can find this by dividing the number of regular sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold, which is 7.

number of shelves filled up = int(4 / 7) = 1

this implies that tom bought enough regular sodas to fill up 1 shelf (i.e., 7 sodas).

we know that tom bought 48 diet sodas, which can fill up approximately 6.9 shelves, leaving 0.1 shelf empty.

tom's fridge holds 7 sodas on each shelf, so we can find the number of shelves required to hold only diet sodas as follows:

number of shelves = int(48 / 7) + 0.1 = 7

this implies that tom's fridge has 7 shelves for diet sodas. So, he can't fill up all 7 shelves entirely with regular sodas.

finally, the total number of shelves required to store all the sodas is the sum of the number of shelves required to store regular sodas and the diet sodas.

total number of shelves required

= number of shelves required for regular sodas + number of shelves required for diet sodas

= 1 + 7

= 8

the final answer is: tom's fridge has 8 shelves in total.

note: in this example, we encountered a mistake in the question, where the number of diet sodas (52) seemed unlikely. We checked if our method was right by modifying the number of diet sodas to a more realistic number (48). We suggest you always double-check the input values to make sure they're realistic and fit the problem.</s>",8

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the given information:
   - The school cafeteria had 38 apples.
   - They used 20 apples to make lunch for 11 students.
   - They bought 28 more apples.

2. Calculate the number of apples used for all students' lunches:
   - The total number of students is 11 + ! (unknown number).
   - The number of apples used for 11 students' lunches is 20.
   - The number of apples used for ! students' lunches is ! times the number of apples used for 11 students' lunches divided by 11.
   - This gives us: ! times (20 / 11) apples.

3. Calculate the total number of apples remaining after lunch preparation:
   - The school cafeteria had 38 apples.
   - They used ! times (20 / 11) apples for lunches.
   - The number of apples remaining is the original number of apples minus the number of apples used for lunches.
   - This gives us: 38 apples - ! times (20 / 11) apples.

4. Calculate the number of additional apples bought:
   - The school cafeteria bought ! plus 28 more apples.
   - The number of additional apples bought is ! times the number of apples bought after using the initial batch of apples.
   - This gives us: ! times (apples remaining after lunch preparation - !(20/11) apples) + 28.

5. Calculate the final number of apples:
   - The school cafeteria initially had 38 apples.
   - They used ! times (20/11) apples for lunches.
   - They bought ! times (apples remaining after lunch preparation - ! times (20/11) apples) + 28 more apples.
   - The final number of apples is the initial number of apples plus the number of apples bought.
   - This gives us: 38 apples + ! times (apples remaining after lunch preparation - ! times (20/11) apples) + 28.

Following these steps, we can solve the problem, but we have two unknowns, which is why we're unable to solve for ! directly. Therefore, we'd need further information to determine !.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. To find the number of trips Luke will make to pick up all 36 trays, we first need to calculate how many trays he can carry in one trip. Given that he can carry 4 trays at a time, let's call this number x.

2. We can find the value of x by dividing the total number of trays (36) by the number of trays Luke can carry in one trip (x):

x = 36 ÷ 4

x = 9

So, Luke can carry 9 trays in one trip.

3. Now, let's find out how many trays Luke can carry from the first table. We know that there are 20 trays in total, and we also know that Luke can carry 9 trays in one trip. Let's call the number of trips Luke makes to carry all the trays from the first table n1:

n1 = 20 ÷ 9

n1 ≈ 2

So, Luke makes 2 trips to carry all the trays from the first table.

4. Similarly, we can find the number of trips Luke makes to carry all the trays from the second table:

n2 = 16 ÷ 9

n2 ≈ 1.8

Since we can't make fractional trips, we round up the value of n2 to the nearest integer:

n2 = 2

So, Luke makes 2 trips to carry all the trays from the second table.

5. Now let's add the number of trips Luke makes from both tables:

total number of trips = n1 + n2

total number of trips = 2 + 2

total number of trips = 4

6. Finally, we have the number of trips Luke makes to pick up all 36 trays, and we can indicate the final answer as follows:

{The final answer is} 4

In conclusion, Luke makes 4 trips in total to pick up all the 36 trays.</s>",9

 number of apples used for lunch = 42 (for students)
 x for breakfast (unknown)
 y for lunch (unknown)
 z for dinner (unknown)

 using the remaining apples for dinner and making pies:

 total number of apples remaining = 96 - (x + y)
 pies made = [remaining apples - (number of apples used for dinner)] / number of apples used for pies

 let's find the number of apples used for dinner:

 number of apples used for dinner = [96 - (x + y)] / 3 (assuming ⅓ of the remaining apples are used for dinner)

 substituting this into the formula for pies made, we get:

 pies made = [96 - (x + y) - [(96 - x - y) / 3]] / 6

 simplifying this expression:

 pies made = [3*(96 - x - y) - (96 - x - y)] / 36

 factorizing this expression:

<|assistant|>
Step 1: Calculate how many action figures Henry needs to complete his collection.

The number of action figures needed to complete the collection is the difference between thetotal required for a complete collection (8) and the number of action figures Henry currently has (3).

8 - 3 = 5

So, Henry needs 5 more action figures to complete his collection.

Step 2: Calculate how much it will cost to buy the remaining action figures.

Each action figure costs $6. We can find the cost of buying 5 action figures by multiplying the cost per figure ($6) by the number of figures (5).

5 action figures @ $6 each = $30 total cost

Step 3: Calculate how much money Henry needs to finish his collection.

We can find the total amount of money Henry needs by adding the cost of the remaining action figures ($30) to the total amount of money he has already spent ($0).

$0 (initial outlay) + $30 (cost of remaining action figures) = $30 (total cost to complete collection)

So, Henry needs $30 to finish his collection.

The final answer is:

Henry needs $30 to complete his collection of action figures.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many $8 toys Frank can buy with his total savings. Let's call the number of toys Frank can buy x.

Frank had saved up $3. After receiving another $37, his total savings now add up to $40. This can be written as an equation:

$3 + 37 = 40$

Let's subtract $3$ from both sides to find out how much Frank saved after buying $x$ toys:

$3 + 37 - 8x = 40 - 8x$

The $-8x$ denotes the fact that Frank has spent $8$ for each toy he buys. If we subtract this number from both sides, we get:

$3 + 37 = 40 - 8x$

$$-8x + 3 + 37 = 40$

Let's simplify the left side, distributing the $-8$ over the $3$ and the $37$:

$-8(x-1) + 40 = 3 + 37$

Next, let's get $x$ on its own by solving for $x$. To do this, we move $x-1$ from the left side to the right side and set it equal to $40$ divided by $-8$:

$-8(x-1) = -5$

$x - 1 = \frac{-5}{-8} = {5}/{8}$

To get $x$ on its own, we simply add $1$ to both sides:

$x = \frac{5}{8} + 1 = \frac{13}{8}$

So, Frank can buy ${13}/{8}$ of $8$ dollar toys with his total savings. The final answer is:

{The final answer is: Frank can buy {13}/{8} = 1.69 toys with his total savings of $40.}</s>",5

Let's represent the number of carrots picked by Vanessa and her mother using variables.

Let x be the number of carrots Vanessa picked.

We have been given that in total, 41 carrots were picked. This means:

41 = x + y

Now, let's represent the number of good carrots picked by the variable b.

Let b be the number of good carrots picked.

We've also been provided that only 24 of the 41 carrots picked were good. So we know:

24 = b

Next, let's represent the number of bad carrots picked by the variable z.

Let z be the number of bad carrots picked.

We know that the total number of carrots picked is 41. Out of these 41 carrots, there were 24 good carrots and z bad carrots, so the remaining carrots would be the ones that were neither good nor bad. We can represent this condition using an equation:

41 = 24 + b + z

Let's solve for z now.

Subtracting the values of b and 24 from both sides of the equation above, we get:

13 = b + z

Now, we can substitute the value of b that we found earlier:

13 = 24 + z

Upon resolving this equation, we see that the number of bad carrots picked is 1.

Therefore, we can say that:

<|assistant|>
First, let's find the total number of people at the picnic. We know there are 23 managers and 7 employees, so the total number of people is the sum of these two groups:

Total number of people = 23 managers + 7 employees
Total number of people = 23 + 7
Total number of people = 20

Next, let's find the number of people on each team. We know there are 6 teams, so we can set up a proportion to find the number of people on each team based on the total number of people:

(Number of people on each team) / (Total number of people) = (6 teams) / (Total number of people)
(x) / 20 = 6 / 20
Cross-multiplying:
6x = 120
Dividing by 6:
x = 20

Now we know each team will have 20 people, since x is the number of people on each team. So, there will be a total of 6 teams times 20 people per team, for a total of 120 people playing volleyball:

Total number of people playing volleyball = 6 teams x 20 people per team

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the number of brownies Tiffany initially baked as x, and the number of brownies she still needs as y. We also know that each brownie requires 1 cup of flour, and Tiffany used 8 cups of flour in total for the initial 8 brownies.

Let's set up a system of equations to represent this information:

1. Number of brownies initially baked + Number still needed = Total number of brownies needed
   x + y = 17

2. Number of cups of flour initially used + Cups of flour still needed = Total number of cups of flour used
   x * 1 + y * 1 = 8 * 9

   Step 1: Isolate x in the second equation to find the number of brownies originally baked
   y * 1 = 8 * 9 - 8
   y = 72 - 8x

   Step 2: Substitute y into the first equation to find the number of brownies still needed

   x + (72 - 8x) = 17

   Step 3: Simplify the expression and solve for x

   x = (17 - 72) / (-8)

   Step 4: Check if the solution is reasonable

   The value of x calculated in Step 3 is negative, which means it is not possible to bake a negative number of brownies. Therefore, this system of equations may not have a solution in this case, as it implies that Tiffany would need more flour than there are total cups of flour used. {There is no solution in this case}.

   Alternatively, we could assume that Tiffany did not use enough flour in the initial batch of brownies, so some of the brownies have gone stale. In that case, we could let y represent the number of stale brownies that she doesn't need to make the party. In this scenario, there could be a solution, as shown below.

   The equation for the number of cups of flour used would look like this:

   x * 1 + (y - x) * 1 = 8 * 9

   After solving for x in this scenario, the value calculated was still negative, which indicates that in practice, Tiffany would not have the necessary flour for the party. {There is no practical solution for this scenario}.

   In both scenarios, we observe that the total number of brownies baked cannot be less than the required number of brownies for the party. We could adjust the second equation to reflect this as:

   x + y = 17

   x * 1 + y * 1 = 8 * 9

   After solving for x in this scenario, the value calculated is still negative, which indicates that in practice, Tiffany would still not have the necessary flour for the party. {There is no practical solution for this scenario}.

   In summary, for the provided scenario, it seems unlikely that Tiffany would require such a small number of brownies and could be mistaken about the total number of brownies required. {There is no practical solution for this scenario}.</s>",72

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Step 1: Find the total number of carrots picked by Carol and her mother.
Carol picked 29 carrots, and her mother picked 16 carrots. Therefore, the total number of carrots picked is:
Carol's carrots + Mother's carrots = 29 + 16 = 45 carrots

Step 2: Find the number of good carrots picked.
Only 38 carrots were good, and we already know that Carol and her mom picked a total of 45 carrots. Let's find which of these picked the good carrots.
First, let's find out how many good carrots did Carol pick. Her share of the good carrots is the ratio of her picked carrots to the total picked carrots. Similarly, we can find her mom's share of the good carrots.
Carol's share = (Carol's picked carrots / Total picked carrots) * Total good carrots

Calculating Carol's share,
Carol's share = (29 / 45) * 38

Carol's good carrots = Carol's share

Calculating her mom's share,
Her mom's share = (Remaining picked carrots / Total picked carrots) * Total good carrots

Her mom's share = (16 / 45) * 38

Her mom's good carrots = Her mom's share

Adding good carrots picked by Carol and her mom,
Total good carrots = Carol's good carrots + Her mom's good carrots

Total good carrots = 29 * Carol's share + 16 * Her mom's share

Substituting for Carol's and her mom's shares,
Total good carrots = (29 / 45) * 38 + (16 / 45) * 38

Total good carrots = 38

38 = 38

Step 3: Find the number of bad carrots.
Total picked carrots = Good carrots + Bad carrots

Substituting for good carrots,
45 = 38 + Bad carrots

Finding the number of bad carrots,
Bad carrots = 45 - 38

Bad carrots = 7

Final answer: Carol and her mom had a total of 7 bad carrots in their garden. {The final answer is: 7}</s>",7

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's first identify the variables.
- x: The number of problems on each worksheet
- n: The total number of problems on all the worksheets
- m: The number of worksheets the teacher has already graded
- k: The number of remaining problems the teacher has left to grade

Now, let's express n, m, and k in terms of x:
- n = x * 17 (The total number of problems is the number of worksheets times the number of problems on each worksheet)
- m = x * 8 (The number of problems the teacher has already graded is the number of worksheets times the number of problems on each worksheet)
- k = x * (17 - 8) (The number of remaining problems is the number of worksheets remaining times the number of problems on each worksheet)

We are given that m = 8, so let's substitute this into our expression for k:
- k = x * (17 - 8)

Now, let's simplify our expression for k:
- k = x * 9

We want to find the value of x, so let's solve for it:
- x = k / 9 (If we know the value of k, we can find the value of x)

We are given that k is not yet known, but we know that the teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, leaving her with 9 left to grade.
- Let's assign a placeholder value for k, and solve for x:
  - k = 90 (Let's say there are 90 remaining problems to grade)
  - x = 90 / 9 = 10 (If we know k, we can easily find the number of problems on each worksheet)

Now that we know the number of problems on each worksheet, we can substitute this value for x into our expressions for m and n:
- m = 8 * 10 = 80 (The number of problems the teacher has already graded)
- n = 17 * 10 = 170 (The total number of problems)

We can check our results to make sure they make sense. If the teacher had already graded 80 problems and there are currently 90 remaining problems, there should be 170 problems in total.

{The final answer is: to grade, the teacher has to grade 90 remaining problems from the original 170 problems. Each worksheet has 10 problems.}</s>",63

Step 1: Identify the given information
- Initially, there were 8 friends playing the game
- Each friend had 6 lives (or ""lives"")
- 2 more players joined the game

Step 2: Determine the total number of players after new addition
- Initial number of players = 8
- Number of new players = 2
- Total number of players = initial number of players + new players
- Total number of players = 8 + 2
- Total number of players = 10

Step 3: Find the total number of lives among the players
- Each friend had 6 lives
- Number of friends = initial number of players
- Total number of lives among the friends = initial number of players x lives of each friend
- Total number of lives among the friends = 8 x 6
- Total number of lives among the friends = 48
- Number of additional lives given to the new players is unknown
- Total number of lives among all players = total number of lives among the friends + additional lives of new players
- Total number of lives among all players = 48 + additional lives

Step 4: Solve for the unknown
- Let u represent the number of lives given to the new players
- Total number of lives among all players = 10 x (lives of each friend + number of lives given to new players)
- Total number of lives among all players = 10 x (6 + u)
- Substitute the expressions from steps 2 and 3 in the equation
- Total number of lives among all players = 8 x 6 + 2 x (6 + u)
- Simplify
- Total number of lives among all players = 48 + 12 + 2u
- Substitute in the value of the number of lives among the friends found in step 3
- Total number of lives among all players = 48 + 2u
- Simplify
- Total number of lives among all players = 50 + 2(u - 1)
- Substitute the value of u

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into individual steps. Here's how:

1. Cody won 49 tickets at the ? arcade. We don't know how many tickets he spent on games, but we'll assume that number is separate from the 49 he won. So, in this first step, we simply need to record how many tickets he won.

   Cody won 49 tickets.

2. The prompt provides another piece of information about Cody. We know that he spent 25 tickets. However, we don't know why he spent 25 tickets, or how long ago he spent them. For now, let's just note that fact, and then move on to the next step.

   Cody spent 25 tickets.

3. The next piece of information is that Cody won a beanie. We don't know how many tickets he won for the beanie. Let's assume it's some number, which we'll call x.

   Cody won a beanie for x tickets.

4. Later on, Cody won 6 more tickets. We can add this number, 6, to the running total of tickets he has accumulated.

   Cody won 6 more tickets, for a total of y tickets so far.

5. In order to get from step 4 to the final answer, we need to solve for y. Here's how:

   Cody won 49 tickets, and we've already established that we don't know how many he spent. Let's call that number z. Then:

   Total tickets = 49 won (+) z spent (+) x for beanie (+) 6 from later win

   y = 49 + z - x - 6 (we subtract x and 6 from y because we want only the net number of tickets Cody has left after spending, winning a beanie, and winning 6 more.)

6. Substitute the other variables (the ones we've already established) into the equation from step 5.

   Total tickets = 49 won (+) 25 spent (+) x for beanie (+) 6 from later win

   y = 49 + 25 - x - 6

7. Now we have a linear equation with four variables (the four unknown values). We can either assign values to these variables, and solve for y, or use algebraic methods to solve for x, z, and y all at once.

   Let's take the easier route and assume some values.

   For illustrative purposes, let's say Cody spent $5 on tickets, won the beanie for 15 tickets, and won another 6 tickets later. That means x = 15 and z = 5.

   Plug these values into the equation from step 6.

   y = 49 + 25 - 15 - 6

   y = 64

8. We now know that Cody has a total of 64 tickets remaining. Let's add this value to our list of steps.

   Cody has a total of 64 remaining tickets.

9. Lastly, we'll combine all of these steps and show Cody's total ticket count by the end of the problem.

   At the ? arcade, Cody won 49 tickets. He spent 25 tickets and won a beanie for 15 tickets, for a total of 49 won (+) 25 spent (-) 15 beanie (+) 6 later win, which equals 64 remaining tickets. The final answer is 64.</s>",30

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find out how many piles Bianca could make with the remaining candies, we need to find how many candies she has left after eating 30!

Step 1: Calculate the number of candies Bianca has left after eating 30!
- First, find how many candies she ate by multiplying the number of candies she ate (30) by the number of question marks in the given expression (?). Since we don't know the exact number of question marks, we'll leave it as an unknown variable (x).
  - 30 * x = 30x candies were eaten
- Subtract the number of candies she ate from the total number of candies she received to find out how many candies she has left.
  - 78 - 30x = remaining candies

Step 2: Find the number of candies in each pile (8) multiplied by the number of piles.
- 8 * x = number of candies in each pile

Step 3: Create a system of linear equations to solve for the unknown variables (x).
- Equation 1: The number of candies Bianca has remaining is equal to the number of candies in all the piles she made.
  - 78 - 30x = 8x * x
- Equation 2: The total number of candies she has remaining should be the same as the number of candies she has left after eating x candies.
  - 78 - 30x = 78 - 30x

Step 4: Solve the system of linear equations for x.
- Eliminate the x terms in Equation 2 by subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2.
  - 8x * x - 8x = 0
- Divide both sides by (8x), which gives us this simplified equation.
  - x(8x - 1) = 0
- If x = 0, the number of candies she receives will be zero, which is impossible!
- If x is non-zero, then in order for x(8x - 1) to equal zero, either x or (8x - 1) has to equal zero.
  - x = 0 would make each of the piles empty, which again is an impossible scenario.
  - (8x - 1) = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we get one real solution: x = 1/8.
  - Therefore, the number of ? in the given expression of candies she ate is 1/8, making the total number of candies she ate to be 30 * (1/8) = 37.5 candies.

Final answer: Bianca could make 9 (integer closest to 11.875) piles with the remaining candies.

The final answer is: Bianca could make 9 piles with the remaining candies.

Let's call the initial 5 friends A, B, C, D, and E. 

Before the new players joined, each friend had 8 lives, so the total number of lives among the initial friends was:

5 friends * 8 lives per friend = 40 lives total

Now let's call the new players F and G. When they joined, the game now had a total of 7 friends playing.

Using the same reasoning as before, we can calculate the total number of lives among these 7 friends:

7 friends * 8 lives per friend = 56 lives total

However, we know that the new players (F and G) also brought along some new lives. Let's say they each brought an additional 4 lives.

F brought 4 new lives and joined the existing group, so the total number of lives she has now is:

8 lives from the initial game + 4 extra new lives = 12 lives total for F.

G brought along an additional 4 lives as well, so the total number of lives G has now is:

8 lives from the initial game + 4 extra new lives = 12 lives total for G.

Now we can calculate the total number of lives among all 7 friends:

A, B, C, D, E (initial friends) each still have 8 lives for a total of 40 lives.
F and G each have 12 lives for a total of 24 new lives.
Together, all 7 friends have a total of:

40 lives initially + 24 new lives = 64 lives total

So, the total number of lives all 7 friends have now is 64 lives.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information. Roger had 25 books initially. He sold 21 of them, earning some money in the process. With this money, he bought 30 new books. At the end, we want to find out how many books he would have in total.

Let's assign variables to the unknown quantities, to make the solution clearer:
- Let x be the money Roger earned by selling 21 books.
- Let y be the number of books Roger has after buying 30 new books with the money earned from selling 21 books.

Now, let's represent the information provided in mathematical equations:
- Number of books originally = 25 (given)
- Number of books sold = 21
- Money earned = x
- New books bought = 30
- Number of books after buying new books = y

The next step is to convert the bought/sold information into equations.

- Number of books sold = Number of books originally - Number of books remaining
- 21 = 25 - (Number of books remaining)

Let's differentiate the sold books from the remaining books to represent each better. Let's use z to represent the number of books Roger currently has.

- Number of books sold = Number of books originally - (Number of books currently have)
- 21 = 25 - z

Substitute 'x' for the money earned by selling 21 books:

- Money earned = 21 * (Price per book)
- x = 21 * (Price per book)

When Roger bought the new 30 books, the price per book could either be the same as the original book price or cheaper. Let's assume the price per book is the same. If it's a different price, make the necessary substitutions as you go through the next few steps.

- Number of books after buying new books = New books bought + (Number of books currently have)
- y = 30 + z

We now have an equation for both 'x' (the money earned) and 'y' (the number of books Roger currently has).
The next step is to find the expression for 'z' (the number of books Roger currently has).

- Number of books originally = (Number of books sold) + (Number of books currently have)
- 25 = 21 + z

Let's substitute the value of 'z' from the first equation we found, so that we have 'z' in terms of 'y':

- y = 30 + (25 - 21)

- y = 30 + 4

- y = 34

Now, we can substitute the value of 'y' in the next equation and find the expression for 'x':

- X = 21 * (Price per book)

Let's use 'p' to represent the price per book in dollars.

- X = 21 * p

- X = 210 dollars

Putting it all together, we now have expressions for 'x' and 'y' in terms of 'p'.

The final answer is that Roger now has 34 books, after selling 21 books and using the money earned to buy 30 new books at the price of $100 per book. The solution is:

- Number of books currently has: 34
- Money earned: $2100

The final answer is: Roger currently has 34 books and $2100 in his pocket.</s>",34

3. We don't know how many games cost $2 each or exactly what he spent this money on. Let's call this expenditure g.

4. After subtracting his expenses, Frank has some money left over. Let's call the amount of money he has left over after these purchases c.

Now let's substitute our values into our equation:

Total earnings = x dollars per lawn times the number of lawns mowed, x, plus the $11 spent on mower blades, b, minus the $g spent on games that cost $2 each.

So, equation:

$Frank's total earnings = x(0.19) + b - g(0.02)$

To solve this equation, we need to find our variables x, b, and g. We're given Frank earned $0.19 for every lawn he mowed and that he spent $11 on mower blades. However, we don't know how many lawns he mowed or how many $2 games he bought.

Let's simplify the equation by moving terms with $g$ to the right-hand side.

$Frank's total earnings - g(0.02) = x(0.19) + b$

Next, let's use the information provided to continue solving our equation. Let's say Frank's total earnings for the summer were $76. Therefore, we have another equation:

$76 = x(0.19) + b - g(0.02)$

Now, subtract $b$ from both sides of our equation:

$76 - b = x(0.19) - g(0.02)$

To find out how many $2 games he could buy with what's left, Frank has some money left unspent, c, after making lawns and buying mower blades and games.

We don't know how many $2 games he could buy with this leftover money. Let's call the number of games he can buy with this money z.

Now let's write out the equation for the amount left, c, in terms of x, g, and our new unknown, z:

$c = x(0.19) - g(0.02) - z(0.02)$

Now let's substitute our equation for Frank's total earnings into our equation for c, to get:

$c = 76 - b - z(0.02)$

Now let's find a way to solve for x, b, and z in terms of our known quantities. Let's find a way to eliminate the variables $c$ and $g$ using our equations.

First, let's substitute our equation for c into the equation for how many $2 games he could buy. This gives us:

$z = \dfrac{c}{0.02}$

We've solved for z, but we want to find how many $2 games he could buy in terms of x, b, and our initial set of unknowns. To do this, let's substitute our newly found equation for z back into our equation for c to eliminate z:

$c = 76 - b - \dfrac{c}{0.02}(0.02)$

Now let's solve for c in terms of our initial unknowns by isolating c:

$c = \dfrac{76}{1 + \dfrac{1}{12}}$

We've now solved for c, but we can't eliminate c yet, since we still need to find a value for b. Let's substitute our equation for c into our equation for Frank's total earnings, to find an equation for b:

$b = Frank's\ total\ earnings - x(0.19) + c$

Now let's substitute in our expression for c to find a value for b:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of permutations and combinations.

We are given that the baseball team has 48 new players and 6 returning players. Let's represent the number of returning players by ""x"".

The coach puts the players into groups with 6 players in each group. We need to find how many groups there are.

To find the number of groups, we can think of it as finding the number of ways we can select the 6 returning players out of the total 54 (48 new players + 6 returning players) players.

The formula for finding the number of ways to select ""r"" items from a group of ""n"" items is:

n choose r = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)

So, the number of ways to select the 6 returning players (x) out of the 54 players is:

54 choose 6 = 54! / (6! * (54-6)!)

The value will be large so instead of finding the exact answer, we can find the approximate answer using Newton's method or Calculus:

ln(54!) = ln(54) + ln(53) + ... + ln(54-5) + ln(54-6)

Approximately, 54! = 1.2 x 10^163 (calculated using Stirling's approximation)

Now, our total number of players is 48 + x. We can substitute the value of ""x"" in the expression for the number of total players:

48 + x = 54

This gives us the value of ""x"". The formula for combinations is similar to permutations with repetitions, so the formula for selecting ""r"" players from a group of ""n"" players when ""r"" is less than the number of identical items equals the number of different groups of ""r"" players will be the same as that of selecting ""r"" distinct players from ""n"" without repetition, provided ""n"" is greater than or equal to ""r"".

The final answer is:

The number of groups with 6 players when considering 48 new players and 6 returning players is approximately 6.1 x 10^96 when using Calculus and Stirling's approximation. {The final answer is: The number of groups with 6 players is approximately 6.1 x 10^96}.</s>",9

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Let x be the number of folders that Nancy created.
2. We know that Nancy had 80 files in total. After deleting 31 files, she had 49 files left.
3. We also know that she added these remaining files to folders, with each folder containing 7 files.
4. Calculate the total number of files in the folders by multiplying the number of folders by the number of files in each folder. This gives:
   x * 7 = 49 (the total number of files in the folders)
5. Simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 7:
   x = 7 (the number of files in each folder) * (the number of folders) / 7 (the number of folders again)
   = (the number of files in each folder) * (the number of folders) / (the number of files in each folder, divided by 7)
   = (the number of files in each folder) / (the number of files per folder, as a fraction)
6. Substitute 7 into this last equation, because we originally assumed that each folder contained 7 files.
7. Using this last equation, we can find the number of folders, x, in terms of the original number of files, 80.
8. Replace the original x with the new x expression in step 4.
9. Here's how the complete solution looks after substitution:
   x * 7 = 49
   (80 - 31 - (80 - 31) * 7 / 7) * 7 = 49
   (80 * 7) / (1 - (31 / 80)) * 7 = 49
   (560) / (1 - 0.39) * 7 = 49
   (560 / 0.61) * 7 = 49
   (91.84) * 7 = 639.28
   Rounded to two decimal places, we get:
   x = 640 (the final answer)

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps and represent the unknown quantities with variables. Let the number of games Luke originally had be denoted by x. The number of games sold is 19, so the number of games left over is (x - 19). We know that each box can hold 4 games, so we can divide the remaining games by 4 to find out how many boxes we need.

Let's write the solution in detail, labeling each step:

1. Given: Luke sold 19 games. Let x be the number of games Luke originally had.

2. Luke sold 19 games, so the number of games remaining is (x - 19).

3. Let y be the number of boxes Luke used. We want to find how many games are in each box (let's call this r).

4. Each box holds 4 games. So, the number of games in each box (r) is 4.

5. We can calculate the total number of games left (after Luke sold 19) by dividing the remaining games by the number of games per box:
(x - 19) ÷ (4) boxes = (x - 19) ÷ r boxes

6. We want to find the number of boxes Luke used (y). So, we can equate the number of games in total with the number of games in the boxes Luke used:
x - 19 = y * r

7. To solve for y, we can divide both sides by the number of games per box (r):
(x - 19) ÷ r = y

8. Now, we can substitute the expressions we found for x and r into this equation:
(x - 19) ÷ (4) = y

9. Let's find x now. We know that Luke started with 39 games and sold 19 of them. There are still some games left, which we find in step 2. So, after substituting in our expressions from steps 2, 4, and 5, we get:
39 = x - 19 + y * 4

10. Let's now substitute the value we found for (x - 19) in step 2 into this equation:
39 = (x - 19) + y * 4

11. Simplifying the equation from step 10:
39 = (x - 19) + 4y

12. Since we want to find y, let's isolate it in this equation:
4y = 39 - (x - 19)

13. If we divide both sides by 4, we can find y:
y = (9 - (x - 19)) ÷ 4

14. Let's also calculate r, the number of games in each box:
r = 4 games

15. We're now ready to provide a full statement including the final answer: 

{The final answer is}: 

Luke sold 19 games, leaving him with (x - 19) games. Each of the y boxes contains 4 games (r), so Luke used (y) boxes in total. Therefore, the total number of games Luke originally had is:

x = 4 * (y) + (x - 19)

x = 4y + (x - 19) 

x = y*(4) + (x - 19)

We can substitute the value we found for y in step 13 to solve this equation:

x = (9 - (x - 19)) ÷ 4 * 4 + (x - 19)

x = (9 - (x - 19))/+ (x - 19)

Multiplying both sides by (-4) and then by (-1) gives us:

(-4)(9 - (x - 19)) = (-4)(-1)(x - 19)

This simplifies to:

36 + 76 = 112 - 4x

Now, if we gather the like terms, we can solve for x:

112 = 88 + 4x

Subtracting 88 from both sides gives us:

24 = 4x

<|assistant|>
Step 1: Determine the number of students for the trivia team.

Let x be the number of students for the trivia team. We know that 17 students did not get picked for the trivia team, so the number of students who did not get picked is 17. The total number of students trying out is 65.

17 did not get picked for the trivia team
65 students tried out

x = 65 - 17

x = 48 students for the trivia team

{The final answer is: 48 students for the trivia team}

Step 2: Find the number of students for the other team.

Let y be the number of students for the other team. We know that all the remaining students went into 8 groups.

Number of students for the trivia team = 48
Number of students who did not get picked = 17
Total number of students who did not make it onto a team = (65 - 48 - 17) = 30

30 students did not make it onto a team
8 groups

y = 30 / 8

y = 3.75 students for the other team, which is not a whole number. Since we cannot have a team with a fractional number of students, this means that not all students who did not make it onto a team will make it into the other team.

{The final answer is: There is no value of y that results in all students getting onto a team}

Step 3: Find the number of students in each group.

Let z be the number of students in each group.

Number of students for the other team = y (which we found cannot be a whole number)
Total number of students trying out = 65

8 groups
total number of students in the 8 groups = 8 * z

65 students trying out
number of students for the trivia team = 48
number of students who did not get picked = 17
number of students who did not make it onto a team (including the ones who did not make it onto the other team) = 30

total number of students who did not make it onto a team = 30
number of students who did not make it onto the other team = 17
number of students left over who did not make it onto either team = 13

65 students trying out
8 groups
groups with students from the other team = y (we found that there is no value of y that results in all students getting onto a team)
groups with students who did not make it onto a team = 8 - y
number of students left over who did not make it onto either team = 13

total number of students in the 8 groups = (8 * y) + (8 - y) * z + 8 * 13 / (8 - y)

65 students trying out
groups with students from the other team = 0 (since we could not find a value of y for which all students make it onto a team)
groups with students who did not make it onto a team = 8
number of students left over who did not make it onto either team = 13

total number of students in the 8 groups = 8 * z + 8 * 13 / (8 - y)

65 students trying out
number of students for the other team = 0
number of students who did not make it onto a team = 58 (total number of students - (students for the trivia team + students for the other team))

total number of students in the 8 groups = (58 / (8 - 0)) * z

z = (65 * (48 + 0 + (58 - 48 + 17) + 13) / (8 + (8 * 0) + (8 * 1)))

z = 8.125 students for each group

Let's represent the number of pictures in each album with the variables A1 through A5. 

We know that a total of 25 pictures were uploaded to Facebook and 10 of them were put into one album. This means that the number of pictures in the first album (A1) is 10:

A1 = 10

The remaining 15 pictures were divided into 5 different albums. Let's let x be the number of pictures in each of these albums:

x + x + x + x + x = 15

Simplifying:

5x = 15

x = 3

So, each of the remaining 4 albums contains 3 pictures:

A2 = A3 = A4 = A5 = 3

Putting it all together, we can now see that Isabel has 10 pictures in the first album and 3 pictures in each of the other 5 albums (A2 - A6):

Total number of pictures = A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 = 10 + 3 (5 times) = 25

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's represent the amount of money Mike earns from mowing lawns and weed eating by M and W, respectively. We'll call the weekly expense c.

Mike earns $14 per mowing job, so if he completes x mowing jobs per week, we can say:

M = 14x dollars per week

Similarly, if he earns $26 per weed eating job, and y represents the number of weed eating jobs he completes per week, we have:

W = 26y dollars per week

Since Mike spends $5 per week, his total expenses are as follows:

c = 5 dollars per week

To find the number of weeks the money will last, we'll find a system of equations that describes how much money Mike will have left at the end of each week. Using the equations we've established, let M' and W' represent the remaining money earned from mowing and weed eating, respectively, and t represents the number of weeks following the start of this calculation.

M' = M - Mt

W' = W - Walt

Here, Mt and Walt represent how much money Mike earns and spends during the first t weeks. We can rewrite these equations to include only dollars earned during the current week, since we're trying to find how long the current total will last:

M' = M - M(t - 1) - c(t - 1)

W' = W - Wy(t - 1) - c(t - 1)

Here, M(t - 1), Wy(t - 1), and c(t - 1) represent how much Mike earned from mowing, weed eating, and expenses in the previous t - 1 weeks. Note that we subtract t - 1 because in the first week, Mike didn't earn revenue or expenses from the current week.

To find how long the money will last, we can set M' and W' to 0, since this implies that Mike has run out of money:

M' = M - M(t - 1) - c(t - 1) = 0

W' = W - Wy(t - 1) - c(t - 1) = 0

Here's where the math gets a bit tricky, because we don't know values for M(t - 1), wy(t - 1), and c(t - 1) because we don't know how much money Mike earned from mowing, weed eating, and expenses per week during the previous t - 1 weeks. 

To simplify the calculation, let's assume that Mike has reached a point where he earns and spends an equal amount on mowing, weed eating, and expenses per week. This means M(t - 1) = Wy(t - 1) = c(t - 1) = r (where r is some given value). Now, we can rewrite the equations as follows:

M' = M - r(t-1)

W' = W - ry(t - 1)

Let's see what happens if we find a value for t that would make both of these equations equal to 0.

M' = M - r(t-1) = 0

W' = W - ry(t - 1) = 0

Solving this system for r, we get:

r(t-1) = M

ry(t - 1) = W

We can calculate t using each equation's formula for r:

t = (M + r) / r

t = (W + ry) / ry

We'd like to use both equations to find t, but we only know that r represents a common weekly value for Mike's mowing, weed eating, and expenses. We don't know the exact values for r, M, and W, so we can't calculate an exact decimal value for t.

However, we can still solve this system by setting M, W, r, and t to whole numbers. Let's set r, the common weekly value, to 10 dollars (as this represents the approximate average for Mike's mowing, weed eating, and expenses). Let's say that Mike has earned a total of 120 dollars so far, and that there are 12 weed eating jobs that he can complete. If we use",8

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can approach it systematically by identifying the unknown quantities (Vanessa's initial number of music and video files) and representing them using variables.

Let's call the initial number of music files M and the initial number of video files V.

We are given that M had 16 : V music files and 48 video files, which can be written as:

M : V = 16 : 48 (ratios)

And, after deleting 30 files from the flash drive, we need to calculate the final number of files for both music and video.

Let's call the final number of music files after deletion M' and the final number of video files after deletion V'.

We know that M' and V' are less than their initial numbers M and V because Vanessa deleted 30 files. Therefore:

M' < M and V' < V

Now, we can write equations for the final number of files using the initial number of files before deletion and the total number of files that we deleted (30).

M' = M - 30 (number of music files remaining)

V' = V - 30 (number of video files remaining)

Next, we can substitute M : V = 16 : 48 to calculate M' and V' algebraically.

First, we can convert our ratios into equations for the initial number of files:

16M = 48V (equations for initial music and video files)

Then, we can calculate M' and V' using these equations. We first substitute the equations for the initial number of files into the equations for M' and V'.

M' = M - 30

16(M - 30) = 48(V - 30) (substituting the equations for the initial number of music and video files)

Next, we solve the equation above for M'.

M' = (48 * V - 16 * 30) / (16 - 48) (simplifying the algebraic expression)

M' = -2V / 9 (simplifying further)

Here, we notice that M' is a linear function of V' with a negative slope (since the denominator is negative). However, because M' must be a non-negative integer, it cannot be a negative number, and so, our equation represents an unrealistic scenario.

Therefore, we might have made an assumption earlier that we deleted some number of files that leaves us with non-negative integers for both M' and V'.

Instead, let's assume that we deleted an equal number of music and video files to preserve the ratio between the number of music and video files.

Let's call the number of music and video files we deleted D.

D = D (number of music and video files deleted is the same)

M' = M - D (number of remaining music files)

V' = V - D (number of remaining video files)

Next, we can substitute M : V = 16 : 48 to find M' and V' in terms of D.

M' = 16(M - D) = 48(V - D) / 3 = V' (ratios)

Now that we have M' and V' in terms of D, we could substitute the values of M' and V' into the equation that represents M' and V' in terms of V (M' = -2V / 9), but this would give us a negative value for M'.

So, our next step would be to rewrite the equation for M' so that it represents a non-negative integer value for M'.

M' = [(48V - 16D) / (16 - 48)] + 9D / (16 - 48) (simplifying the algebraic expression)

Now that we have a formula for M' in terms of V and D, we can calculate M' and V' with the final number of music and video files after deletion, respectively.

We are given that Vanessa deleted 30 files in total from her flash drive. Let's assume that she deleted equal numbers of music and video files.

D = 30

M' = [(48V - 16 * 30) / (16 -",34

2. Next, let's set up the equation for the number of total shirts that Dave washed before school. This will help us find out how many shirts he needs to wash separately.

x is the number of shorts that Dave washed, and we know from the problem that he also washed some number of shirts before school. Let's call this number y.

So the total number of shirts that Dave washed before school is x shorts plus y shorts with short sleeve shirts, plus z (which is yet unknown) long sleeve shirts, since x and y are both unknown at this point.

This can be written as:

shorts + short sleeve shirts + long sleeve shirts = total shirts before school
x + yshort sleeve shirts + zlong sleeve shirts = total shirts before school

3. Now, let's figure out how many total shirts Dave had to wash before school. We know that he had to wash 46 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts before school.

Call the total number of shirts p. Then:

Short sleeve shirts + Long sleeve shirts = total shirts
46short sleeve shirts + 27long sleeve shirts = p

4. Let's create an equation that represents the number of total shirts (both short and long sleeve) that Dave had washed by the time school started.

We know that Dave washed some number of shorts (x) and short sleeve shirts (y) before school, and we also know that he washed 20 shirts by the time school started. Call this number t.

Then, total shirts (both short and long sleeve) = x shorts + y short sleeve shirts + t

5. We can now plug what we know into our equations and start solving.

Equation 1: shorts + short sleeve shirts + long sleeve shirts = total shirts before school

We already know how many short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts Dave washed before school (46 short sleeve shirts, 27 long sleeve shirts), and we know how many shorts Dave washed before school (x).

Substituting this into equation 1, we get:

x shorts + 46short sleeve shirts + zlong sleeve shirts = total shirts before school

6. Equation 2: short sleeve shirts + long sleeve shirts = total shirts

We already know how many short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts Dave had to wash before school (46 short sleeve shirts, 27 long sleeve shirts), so we can just substitute those numbers directly into equation 2:

46short sleeve shirts + 27long sleeve shirts = p

7. Next, we'll use equation 3 to find the number of total shirts that Dave had washed by the time school started.

We know x shorts, y short sleeve shirts, and how many shirts Dave washed by the time school started (t), but we don't yet know how many long sleeve shirts he washed by then (z).

Total shirts (both short and long sleeve) = x shorts + y short sleeve shirts + zlong sleeve shirts + t other shirts

8. We also know that Dave had washed a total of 20 shirts by the time school started. Call this number u.

x shorts + y short sleeve shirts + zlong sleeve shirts + t other shirts + u = total shirts

9. In order to find z (the number of long sleeve shirts Dave hadn't washed by the time school started), we can eliminate x and t from equations 1 and 8.

We know that x and t are both unknowns in both equations. By subtracting equation 1 from equation 8, we can eliminate this duplicate information.

(x shorts + 46short sleeve shirts + zlong sleeve shirts - x) + (y short sleeve shirts + u - y short sleeve shirts) = p - x

This simplifies to:

zlong sleeve shirts + u = p - x

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Let x be the number of potatoes the chef has already cooked. Given that he has already cooked 7 potatoes, we have x = 7.

2. The total number of potatoes the chef needs to cook is 9. This is our target number.

3. We know that each potato takes 3 minutes to cook. Let t be the time it takes the chef to cook the remaining potatoes.

4. After cooking 7 potatoes, the chef has cooked a total of 7 potatoes * 3 minutes per potato = 21 minutes worth of potatoes. We want to find how many minutes are left before the chef reaches his target of cooking 9 potatoes.

5. To find the remaining number of potatoes, we use the following equation: 9 - 7 = 2 (we know the chef will cook 2 more potatoes). The number of remaining potatoes is 2.

6. The number of remaining potatoes multiplied by the number of minutes required to cook each potato gives us the number of minutes remaining to cook the 2 remaining potatoes. This is represented by 2 * 3 = 6 minutes.

7. Now we know that the amount of time it takes the chef to cook all of the potatoes is the sum of the time it takes to cook the first 7 potatoes and the time it takes to cook the remaining 2 potatoes.

8. The total time taken to cook the first 7 potatoes is 21 minutes. This means the remaining time is:

    total time - time taken to cook first 7 potatoes
         = t - 21

9. We can now substitute our given values into the equation:

    t - 21 = 6
    
    t = 6 + 21
    t = 27 minutes

10. Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is 27 minutes.}

An alternative method could be as follows:

1. First, we know that the chef needs to cook a total of 9 potatoes, of which 7 have already been cooked (we know this because the problem explicitly says the chef has already cooked 7 potatoes). We calculate the remaining number of potatoes: 9 - 7 = 2.

2. Each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, so we calculate the time taken to cook the 7 potatoes already cooked: 7 * 3 = 21 minutes.

3. We now calculate the time taken to cook the remaining 2 potatoes: 2 * 3 = 6 minutes.

4. Add the times taken to cook the 7 potatoes and the 2 remaining potatoes, and we get the total cooking time: 21 + 6 = 27 minutes.

5. Putting it all together, our final answer will be: {The final answer is 27 minutes.}

This is known as the ""subtraction method"" and is an alternative way to solve this type of problem, but the method above tends to be much more efficient in terms of computation time.

Whatever method you choose, it's essential to ensure that your calculations are correct and can be easily followed by someone checking your work. I hope this helps!</s>",6

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's represent the number of pictures taken at the zoo as x and the number of pictures taken at the museum as y. The total number of pictures taken during the vacation before any were deleted can be found by adding the number of pictures taken at the zoo and museum. Let's call this number t.

We know that:

x at the zoo = 41
y at the museum = 29
x + y = t (total number of pictures taken)

After deleting 15 pictures, the number of pictures left is t - 15. We can set up an equation to find this value. Let's call this number s (short for ""still have"").

t - 15 = s (number of pictures left after deleting 15)

Substituting our relationship from before, let's express t in terms of x and y:

t = x + y

Let's substitute this into our second equation:

x + y - 15 = s

Now let's use some algebraic manipulation to solve for x in terms of s, y, and 15.

x = s - y + 15 (the solution we're looking for!)

So we've found a relationship between how many pictures Gwen has left, how many she took at the museum, and how many she deleted. Let's plug it into an equation to see how many pictures Gwen has left in total.

(s - y + 15) + y = s (total number of pictures Gwen still has by combining the ones from the zoo and the museum after deleting)

Now let's combine everything:

total number of pictures Gwen still has = (number of pictures from the zoo) + (number of pictures from the museum) - 15

                                           = (number of pictures from the zoo at the start) + (number of pictures from the museum at the start) - 15

                                           = 41 + 29 - 15

                                           = 35 (number of pictures Gwen still has left after deleting 15)

Remember, we computed this relationship using algebraic manipulation, which is a powerful tool whenever you're looking to connect two equations representing the same idea.

So if Gwen deleted 15 pictures, she'd still have 35 pictures left, having taken x = 31 pictures at the zoo and y = 24 pictures at the museum during her vacation (using our relationship to solve for x in terms of s, y, and 15).

The final answer is 35.</s>",55

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's call the original number of puppies x.

After 34 more puppies are brought in, the new total number of puppies is x + 34.

We are given that the ratio of puppies adopted daily to the total number of puppies is 4 : x. This means that the number of puppies adopted daily is 4 times the number of puppies (x) in the shelter.

Call the number of puppies adopted daily y. Therefore, y is equal to 4 times the number of puppies in the shelter:

y = 4 * x

We also know that the number of puppies adopted daily is decreasing the total number of puppies in the shelter. To find how many days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we set up an equation that connects the number of puppies in the shelter to the number that are adopted (assuming no more puppies come into the shelter).

At any point in time, let x represent the number of puppies left in the shelter, and let t represent the number of days that have passed. We know that y, the number of puppies adopted daily, is decreasing as the number of puppies left in the shelter decreases.

In one day, the number of puppies left in the shelter decreases by y.

x(t+1) = x(t) - y

We can substitute in our expressions for x, y, and t from earlier to arrive at an equation with only the unknown variables x and t.

x(t+1) = x(t) - 4x(t)/(x(t) + 34)

Simplifying the right-hand side using the Quotient Rule, we get:

x(t+1) = x(t) * [1 - 4/(x(t) + 34)]

This equation represents the total number of puppies in the shelter at time t+1, given the starting number of puppies (x(t)) and the number of puppies adopted daily (y).

To find how many days it takes for all the puppies to be adopted, we set the number of puppies after all adoption to 0, that is, x(t) = 0.

0 = x(t) * [1 - 4/(x(t) + 34)]

Solving for t, we get:

t = [(1-4/78) * Log[(1-4/78)/(1-4)]] / Log[(34+x)/(34)]

Although the equation is not in the simplest form, we can use a calculator to find the value of t. However, we can't find the exact value of t because we don't know the starting number of puppies x.

{The final answer is}: An approximate answer for how many days it would take to adopt all the puppies would be [(1-4/78) * Log[(1-4/78)/(1-4)]] / Log[(34+70)/34] ~ 140.7 days.

Note: The exact formula is valid for any starting number of puppies x.</s>",9

                    question:
                     Will : had 59 pieces of clothing , to wash. He put 32 of them in : one ; load, ; but . decided ! to split the ; rest ; into . 9 , equal loads. ? How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first need to find how many pieces of clothing Will had left to wash after putting 32 in the first load. This can be found by subtracting the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes:

59 - 32 = 27 clothes left to wash

Next, we need to split the remaining clothes into 9 equal loads. To do this, we divide the number of clothes left into equal parts:

27 ÷ 9 = 3 clothes per small load

Therefore, each of the small loads should contain 3 clothes. We can represent this using algebraic notation, where : represents Will and ! represents his sudden change of mind:

: split the remaining clothes into 9 small loads, each containing 3 clothes:

: {first small load} : {second small load} : ... : {ninth small load}

After finding out how many clothes each of the small loads should contain, we can now calculate the total number of clothes in all the small loads combined:

9 loads x 3 clothes per load = 27 clothes in total

Comparing this with the number of clothes Will had left to wash, we can see that this matches the number of clothes we found earlier (27 clothes). Hence, we can confirm that our calculation is correct.

To summarize, at the end of the splitting process, each of the small loads would contain 3 clothes. The final answer is:

: split the remaining clothes into 9 small loads, each containing 3 clothes: : {first small load} : {second small load} : ... : {ninth small load}

Each small load would have 3 clothes, but since the question didn't provide the exact names of these small loads, you can label these loads any way you want, such as : {small load 1} : {small load 2} : ... : {small load 9}.</s>",3

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we'll need to break it down into smaller, more manageable steps.

First, let's identify the unknown quantity. Since we're asked how much candy Adam had total, we're looking for the total number of pieces.

Next, let's create equations for each type of candy. Let'x' be the number of boxes of chocolate candy Adam bought, and let'y' be the number of boxes of caramel candy.

For chocolate candy:

x boxes, each containing 4 pieces = 4x pieces total

For caramel candy:

y boxes, each containing 4 pieces = 4y pieces total

Now, we can add these two quantities together to find the total number of pieces.

4x pieces (from chocolate) + 4y pieces (from caramel) = Total number of pieces

Let's write this as an equation:

4x + 4y = Total number of pieces

To get the total number of pieces, we need to solve for 'Total number of pieces'. This involves isolating the 'Total number of pieces' term.

First, we can collect the 'Total number of pieces' term on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll combine like terms:

4(x + y) = Total number of pieces

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate 'Total number of pieces':

(x + y) = {Total number of pieces}/4

This gives us the final answer: after buying x boxes of chocolate candy, each containing 4 pieces, and y boxes of caramel candy, each containing 4 pieces, Adam had a total of (x + y) pieces.

The final answer is (x + y) pieces.</s>",28

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. April's discount, flowers, is having a sale where each flower is priced at $6.
2. Katie purchased 5 roses and 5 daisies from April's discount, flowers.
3. We can write Katie's total expenditure in terms of the cost of the roses and daisies as follows:
   Total expenditure = Cost of roses + Cost of daisies
4. The cost of each rose is $6, and we have bought 5 roses, so:
   Cost of roses = $6 × 5 = $30
5. Let the cost of each daisy be x dollars.
6. Now, we have 5 daisies, and each daisy costs x dollars. Therefore:
   Cost of daisies = $x × 5 = $5x
7. Adding up the costs of roses and daisies, we get:
   Total expenditure = $30 + $5x
8. This value is what we want to find, so let's rearrange this expression:
   $30 + $5x = Katie's total expenditure
9. Therefore, Katie spent Katie's total expenditure dollars on flowers from April's discount, flowers.
10. We can also rearrange this expression to find the value of x:
   $5x = Katie's total expenditure - $30
11. Dividing both sides by $5:
   x = (Katie's total expenditure - $30) ÷ $5
12. After rearranging, plug the values of x back in the expression for the total expenditure, and replace Katie's total expenditure with its original representation from Step 9.
13. Using the substitution method, we can write Katie's total expenditure in terms of the number of daisies bought:
   Total expenditure = $30 + $5((Katie bought daisies) ÷ $5)
14. At last, by simplifying the expressions, we finally have:
   Total expenditure = $35(Katie bought daisies)

We now know that the total amount Katie spent on flowers from April's discount, flowers is $35 times the number of daisies bought.

 {The final answer is: Total expenditure = $35d, where d is the number of daisies bought.}</s>",60

<|assistant|>
1. To find the total number of adventure books purchased, we can use what is given: 

   Victor bought x32 adventure books. Let's call the total number of adventure books purchased ""T"".

   T = 32 (number of adventure books) + x32 (number of adventure books Victor bought)

   Simplifying this, T - 32 is the number of adventure books purchased but not bought by Victor. This will be useful later.

   T = 32 + x32

2. Now, to find the total number of mystery books purchased, again, let's call this ""M"".

   M = 37 (number of mystery books) + x37 (number of mystery books Victor bought)

   M - 37 is the number of mystery books purchased but not bought by Victor. Simplifying, M - 37 is also useful later.

   M = 37 + x37

3. Next, we know that 16 of the mystery books were used. Let's call this ""U"".

   U = 16

4. Now, to figure out how many new mystery books Victor bought, we can use what we know about the old mystery books (the U we just found) as well as the new mystery books that were bought by Victor. Let's call the number of new mystery books ""N"".

   N = x37 (number of mystery books that Victor bought) - (M - 37 - U) (number of mystery books left at the school after the old mystery books are taken into account).

   Let's break this down a little bit. We have M - 37 mystery books left at the school after the old mystery books have been taken into account. From these, we're taking out the 16 mystery books that were used.

5. Finally, we can combine the total number of adventure books and mystery books with the number of new mystery books that Victor bought. Let's call this total ""TOTAL"".

   TOTAL = T (total number of adventure books purchased) + N (total number of new mystery books)

   TOTAL = 32 (number of adventure books) + 37 (number of mystery books originally) + x32 (number of adventure books that Victor bought) + x37 (number of mystery books Victor bought) - (M - 37 - 16) (number of mystery books left at the school after the old mystery books are taken into account).

   Simplifying,

   TOTAL = (32 + x32) (total number of adventure books) + (37 - 16) (number of mystery books left) + x37 (number of mystery books Victor bought).

6. Finally, when we combine ""THE FINAL ANSWER IS: "" with the expression we made in step 5, we end up with:

   THE FINAL ANSWER IS: The total number of books purchased is equal to the sum of the number of adventure books and the new mystery books that Victor bought, which in turn is equal to the sum of the original number of adventure books, the original number of mystery books minus the number used, and the number of new mystery books Victor bought.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the principle of conservation of number, which states that the total number of items remains constant even if some items are added or removed. Let's break it down into steps:

1. Maria initially picks 48 carrots: We can represent this as x = 48, where x is the total number of carrots Maria has.

2. Maria throws out 11 carrots: Let's say y is the number of carrots Maria throws out. We can find y using the formula y = 11. We can also find the number of carrots left (after throwing away 11) by subtracting y from x: x - y = 48 - 11 = 37 carrots. Let's call this quantity z: z = x - y = 37.

3. Maria picks 15 more carrots the next day: We can represent this as p = 15, which is the number of carrots Maria picks on the second day. We can find the total number of carrots Maria has after the second day by adding the total number of carrots left (z) from the first day to the number picked on the second day (p): z + p = 37 + 15 = 52. Let's call this new quantity q: q = z + p = 52.

4. Our final answer is the total number of carrots Maria has after picking some and throwing away others: The total number of carrots Maria has is q = x - y + p = 48 - 11 + 15 = 52. Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is 52 carrots}.</s>",52

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of roses with the variable x. When the florist first had 50 roses, we can write that as: x = 50

Next, when she sold 15 of them, she was left with (50 - 15) = 35 roses. Let's represent this with another variable, y, meaning y represents the number of roses she had after selling 15. Then, we have: x - 15 = y

Later, the florist bought 21 more roses, which adds to the number of roses she had after selling 15. Let's represent this with the variable z. Then, we have: y + 21 = z

We want to find out the final number of roses she had (at the end), which is represented by x.

To find x, we can combine the two equations we have: x = y

Substitute y from the second equation into the first to eliminate the variable y:

x = (x - 15) + 21

Simplify the right-hand side: x = (x - 15) + 21

x - 15 = 21

At the end, the florist had 36 roses, which is our final answer: {The final answer is 36}.

First, let's determine how many math problems Isabel had to complete. There were 2 pages of math homework, and each page had 5 problems. Using basic multiplication, we can calculate:

2 pages x 5 problems per page = 10 math problems total.

Next, let's calculate the number of reading homework problems. Again, we can use multiplication to find the total number of problems:

4 pages x 5 problems per page = 20 reading problems total.

Adding up the total math and reading problems we've calculated, we find that Isabel had to complete a total of:

10 math problems + 20 reading problems = 30 problems total. {The final answer is} 30 problems.</s>",30

<|assistant|>
Step 1: Determine the number of friends playing the game before more players joined.

There were 4 friends playing the game before more players joined, so the number of friends is 4.

Step 2: Determine how many lives each friend had.

Each friend had 3 lives, so the total number of lives for the friends was 12.

Step 3: Determine how many more players joined the game.

The problem tells us that 5 more players joined the game.

Step 4: Determine how many lives the new players had, since the problem doesn't specify this.

To keep the total number of lives constant, we can assume that the new players also had 3 lives each. Therefore, the new players had a total of 15 lives.

Step 5: Find the total number of players and their total number of lives.

The total number of players was the original number of friends (4) plus the number of new players (5). Therefore, the total number of players was 9.

The total number of lives was the total number of lives for the friends (12) plus the number of lives for the new players (15). Therefore, the total number of lives was 27.

Step 6: Find the number of lives each player had, after calculating the total number of players and their total number of lives.

To find how many lives each player had, we divide the total number of lives by the total number of players. Therefore, each player had {The final answer is} 3 lives.

{The final answer is} 3 lives per player.

(Note: In step 6, we're assuming that no lives were lost, since the problem doesn't provide information about whether any lives were lost. However, if some lives were lost, the number of lives remaining after the new players joined would be less than the total number of lives for all players.)

This problem could also be done using a matrix or a system of equations, but the step-by-step method is often easier to follow for beginners.</s>",27

Let's call the number of 2 dollars toys Kaleb could buy with the remaining money after buying the game x.

Given: Kaleb had $12.
           Kaleb spent $8 on a new . game.
           Each toy costs $2.

Step 1: Find how much money Kaleb has left after buying the game:
      Kaleb spent $8 on the game.
      So, Kaleb's total spendings are $8.
      Subtract the amount Kaleb spent on the game from the total money Kaleb had:
           $12 - $8 = $4

      Amount left with Kaleb = $4

Step 2: Find how many toys Kaleb could buy with the remaining money:
      Each toy costs $2.
      Kaleb could buy x toys with the remaining money.
      Amount spent on x toys = $2 (price of each toy) * x (number of toys)
      Substitute the value of the remaining money and simplify:
          $2x = $4 (amount left with Kaleb)
          $2x = $4
          $x = $4 / $2
          $x = 2

      Kaleb could buy 2 toys with the remaining money.

{The final answer is: Kaleb could buy 2 toys with the remaining money after spending $8 on a new . game.}

Alternative solution using variables:

Let's use a variable, c, to represent the number of toys Kaleb could buy with the remaining money.

Given: Kaleb had $12.
           Kaleb spent $8 on a new . game.
           Each toy costs $2.

Step 1: Find how much money Kaleb has left after buying the game:
      Kaleb spent $8 on the game.
      Amount left with Kaleb after buying the game = $12 - $8 = $4.

Step 2: Find how many toys Kaleb could buy with the remaining money:
      Kaleb could buy c toys with the remaining money.
      Total amount Kaleb spent on toys = $2 (price of each toy) * c (number of toys)
      Total amount Kaleb spent on toys = $2c
      Amount left with Kaleb after buying toys = $4 - $2c (difference between the original amount left and the amount spent buying toys)
      Using this information we can create a system of equations:
      $2c = $4
      $c = 2

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can first calculate the total number of math problems Katie had to complete. If each page had 9 problems, and Katie had 7 pages of math homework, then we know:

math problems = pages of math homework × number of problems per page
math problems = 7 × 9 = 63

Next, we can find the number of reading problems Katie had to complete. Since we're not given the number of problems per page, we'll have to find this information first. Let's assume, for now, that there are also 9 problems per page for reading homework. Then:

reading problems = pages of reading homework × number of problems per page
reading problems = 3 × 9 = 27

However, we're not sure if this assumption is correct. If there are actually fewer problems per page for reading homework, we'll see a difference in the total number of problems Katie had to complete. Let's use this information to find the total number of problems Katie had to complete:

total problems = math problems + reading problems
total problems = 63 + 27 = 90

Now, let's check if our assumption of 9 problems per page was correct. We know that Katie had to complete 90 problems in total, and we also know how many math problems she had to complete. If our assumption of 9 problems per page was correct, then:

90 problems = 63 math problems + 27 reading problems

But now we see that this is not true. If we solve for the number of reading problems using variables (which are denoted with question marks), we can find the correct number of problems per page for reading homework:

90 = 63 + ? reading problems
90 - 63 = ? reading problems
? reading problems = 90 - 63
? reading problems = 27

Since we're not given the exact number of problems per page for reading homework, we can only work with integers, which means we rounded 27.3 to 27 (we rounded down since 27.3 is closer to 27 than 28).

Therefore, each page of reading homework has 27 problems. Let's recalculate reading problems and total problems now that we've found the correct number of problems per page for reading homework:

reading problems = pages of reading homework × number of problems per page
reading problems = 3 × 27 = 81

total problems = math problems + reading problems
total problems = 63 + 81 = 144

We can now be sure that our assumption of 9 problems per page for math homework was also correct, since we ended up with the same number of math problems as we did before.

{The final answer is: Katie had to complete a total of 144 problems, with 63 math problems and 81 reading problems.}</s>",90

<|assistant|>
Let's break this down into smaller steps.

1. Janet bought a total of 6 country albums while shopping for music online. Each country album came with a lyric sheet and had 9 songs. How many songs did Janet buy in total from country albums?

 To find the number of songs from country albums, we can use the formula for finding the number of items based on the number bought and the number of items per item bought.

 Number of songs from country albums = Number of country albums * Number of songs per album

 Number of songs from country albums = 6 * 9

 Number of songs from country albums = 54

 {The final answer is: 54}

 2. Janet also bought 2 pop albums while shopping for music online. Each pop album came with a lyric sheet and had 9 songs. How many songs did Janet buy in total from pop albums?

 Similar to the calculation we used for country albums, we can use the same formula to find the number of songs from pop albums.

 Number of songs from pop albums = Number of pop albums * Number of songs per album

 Number of songs from pop albums = 2 * 9

 Number of songs from pop albums = 18

 {The final answer is: 18}

 3. To find the total number of songs that Janet bought online, we can add the number of songs she bought from both country and pop albums.

 Total number of songs = Number of songs from country albums + Number of songs from pop albums

 Total number of songs = 54 + 18

 Total number of songs = 72

<|assistant|>
First, we need to find how much money Jerry has in total. We know he made $14 mowing lawns and $31 weed eating, for a total of $45.

Next, we need to find out how long $45 will last him, given that he spends $5 a week. To calculate this, we can create a formula for finding out how long $x will last him.

Starting with what we know:

x (amount of money) / 5 (weekly expense) = t (number of weeks)

Let's call our original $45 amount x. Applying that formula:

45 / 5 = t

9 (number of weeks) = t

So 9 weeks is how long Jerry's total amount of $45 will last him.

Here's a chart showing each step of the calculation:

| Formula      | Substitution         | Equation                                   | 
|------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| x / 5       | $45$                | 9             |
|           |                      |                                             |
|           |                      |                                             |

The final answer is: Jerry's $45 will last him 9 weeks.

Now let's finish calculating the total amount of time Jerry's income will last him.

First, we calculate how long Jerry's $14 from mowing lawns will last him. We use the formula we just established:

x / 5 = t

14 / 5 = t

2.8 weeks = t

Next, let's find how long Jerry's $31 from weed eating will last him. Using the original formula:

31 / 5 = t

6.2 weeks = t

Putting this all together:

Original formula: x / 5 = t

$14 / 5$ = t1 (number of weeks for lawn-mowing income)

$31 / 5$ = t2 (number of weeks for weed-eating income)

$45 / 5$ = t3 (number of weeks for combined income)

Let's write all this information in a chart:

Now let's solve for t1, t2, and t3:

t1 = 2.8 weeks

t2 = 6.2 weeks

Using algebra we can find the value of t3 since we know t1 and t2.

First, we'll rewrite the chart with t3 being the unknown:

Next, we'll replace t1 and t2 with their values from before:

<|assistant|>
Steps:

1. Adam had a total of 33 books. {The initial number of books Adam had is 33.}

2. Adam sold 11 books, reducing his number of books to 22 (33 - 11).

3. Adam received some money from selling these 11 books. Let's call this unknown amount ""x"".

4. Adam used this money (x) to buy 23 new books, which he added to his reduced collection of 22 books.

5. Now, Adam has a total of 22 + 23 = 45 books.

6. Since Adam is still using the money (x) he received from selling the 11 books, we can say that x is equal to the amount he spent on the 23 new books. So, let's find out how much that is.

7. Adam spent x (his earnings from selling 11 books) to buy 23 new books. The average price per book is found by dividing the total amount spent by the number of books purchased.

8. The average price per book is: x / 23. This price per book will help us find how much Adam paid for each of the new books.

9. Adam's new collection consists of both the 22 remaining books from his previous collection and the 23 new books he just bought. So, Adam's final collection consists of a total of 45 books.

10. The cost per book (average price) that Adam paid for both his original and new collections is the total amount spent (x) divided by the total number of books (45).

11. To find out how many books Adam has in his final collection, we can calculate this by finding the average number of books he has per dollar (cost per book).

12. For each dollar Adam spent, he has roughly (45 books) / x books. This is his average number of books per dollar. Let's call this figure y.

13. To find out how many books Adam has in his final collection, we can now multiply the amount Adam spent on his new books (x) with his average number of books per dollar (y).

14. Therefore, the number of books Adam has in his final collection is: (Number of new books) + (Amount of money used for new books) x (Average number of books per dollar spent on new books).

15. Using the above calculation, the number of books Adam has in his final collection is: 23 + (x) * y.

16. But, we know that Adam's final collection consists of both his remaining 22 books and the new 23 books. Therefore, we can find the exact value of y by equating both calculations and solving for y.

17. Using our equation from step 14, we get: 45 = 22 + 23 + (x) * y.

18. And we know Adam's original number of books (33) and the number of books he sold (11) and used the money (x) for buying new ones with an average price per book (x / 23).

19. Let's use these known values to rearrange our step 14 formula as y = (45 - 22 - 23) / (x * (33 - 11 - 23) / 23).

20. By simplifying this expression, we get:

    y = (12 / (x * 0)) = 12 / x.

21. We found the value of y from steps 16 to 20, and by using the expression y = (Number of books) / (Amount used to buy these books), we can determine the exact number of books that Adam has in his final collection.

22. Let's multiply the amount spent on his new books (x) and Adam's average number of books per dollar spent on new books (12 / x) from step 21.

23. Therefore, Adam's final collection contains the following number of books:

    23 + (x) * (12 / x) = 35 books.

24. Therefore, the final answer we know is:

    Adam has a total of 35 books, including his original and new collections. {The final",45

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Kaleb was collecting cans for recycling on both Saturday and Sunday.

2. On Saturday, he filled 5 bags. We don't know how many cans were in each bag, so let's call that number x.

3. On Sunday, he filled another 5 bags. Again, let's call the number of cans in each bag on Sunday y.

4. We know that on both days, there were 4 cans in each bag. So, the total number of cans in one bag on Saturday is 4x, and the total number of cans in one bag on Sunday is 4y.

5. Let's find the total number of cans Kaleb collected on Saturday. Since he filled 5 bags, the total number of cans on Saturday is 4x times 5 bags, or 20x cans.

6. Next, let's find the total number of cans Kaleb collected on Sunday. Again, since he filled 5 bags, the total number of cans on Sunday is 4y times 5 bags, or 20y cans.

7. Now, let's add up the total number of cans Kaleb collected on both Saturday and Sunday. Since we found the number of cans on Saturday to be 20x, and the number of cans on Sunday to be 20y, the total number of cans is 20x plus 20y. This gives us our final answer:

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller step-by-step procedures:

1. Number of mystery books:
Nancy has ! 2 shelves of mystery books. Each shelf has exactly 6 books, so we can set up an equation to find the number of mystery books she has:

   ! 2 shelves x 6 books per shelf = number of mystery books
   ! 2 x 6 = 12 (number of mystery books)

2. Number of picture books:
Nancy has 6 shelves of picture books. Each shelf has exactly 6 books, so we can set up an equation to find the number of picture books she has:

   6 shelves x 6 books per shelf = number of picture books
   6 x 6 = 36 (number of picture books)

3. Total number of books:
Now we have the number of mystery books and picture books. To find the total number of books Nancy has, we add the number of mystery books and the number of picture books:

   Total number of books = Number of mystery books + Number of picture books
   = 12 (from step 1) + 36 (from step 2)
   = 48 (total number of books)

   The final answer is: Nancy has 48 books in total.</s>",48

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this word problem, we can represent Paul's initial savings as $3, his weekly allowance as $x, and the price of each toy as $5.

First, we set up an equation to represent the total amount of money Paul has:

$3 + x = \text{total money}$

Next, we add the $7 he receives for his allowance to the equation:

$3 + x + 7 = \text{new total money}$

We want to find out how many toys (let's call this variable ""n"") Paul can buy with the remaining money after buying the toys. Suppose Paul has $M$ dollars left after buying n toys. Then we can find out the relationship between $M$ and $n$:

$M = 5n + ((3 + x) + 7) - (5n) = ((3 + x) + 7) - n$

Now, we want to find out how many toys Paul can buy given his remaining money is $20. So, we substitute the right-hand part into the equation we found above.

$M = ((3 + x) + 7) - n$

$20 = ((3 + x) + 7) - n$

$n = ((3 + x) + 7) - 20$

Next, we isolate the variable $n$ by subtracting $((3 + x) + 7)$ and $20$ to both sides, keeping in mind $((3 + x) + 7) \ge 0$ so the argument inside the parenthesis should not become negative. Hence, we get $n \ge 4$ when $x=0$. Thus, we simplify $n$ by subtracting $20$.

$n = ((3 + x) + 7) - 20$

$n = (x - 13)$

$n$ isn't always a positive integer, so we need to ensure we've satisfied this condition. We check that $n \ge 0$ when $x \ge 13$. Otherwise, $n$ would become negative. This is valid since $x$ is equal to or greater than $0$.

Now, we know that Paul can only buy whole toys at a time ($n$ is an integer), and we ensure that Paul can still afford to buy toys after checking our solutions. If Paul has saved $13$ initially and additionally received his weekly allowance ($13 \le x$), he can buy $n = 4$ 5 dollar toys with his remaining money of $20 - 5(4) = $6$ after buying those 4 toys.

The final answer is $n = 4$. 

Therefore, Paul can buy 4 5 dollar toys with his remaining money.</s>",2

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Wendy starts with 43 lives. (Initial number of lives = 43)
2. In a hard part of the game, she loses 8 lives. (Loss of lives = -8)
3. The result is that she now has 35 lives. (Remaining number of lives after loss = 43 - 8) 

Equation for Step 3: 43 - 8 = 35

4. She gains 39 more lives in the next level. (Gain of lives = 39)
5. After gaining 39 lives, she now has a total of 35 + 39 lives. (Total number of lives after gain = 35 + 39)

Equation for Step 5: Initial number of lives + Gain = Final number of lives. 43 + 39 = X (X being the final number of lives)

Thus, After gaining 39 lives, Wendy will have a total of 82 lives (43 + 39).

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of files on Katie's computer as x, the number of files she deleted as d, and the number of folders she created as f.

Originally, Katie had 85 files (x). She deleted 40 of them (x-d = 45), leaving her with 45 files (y). Then she created f folders, each with 5 files (5*f = y).

We can set up two equations to represent this situation:

1. The number of files before deleting is equal to the number of files after deleting, plus the number of files in folders: x = y + d
2. The number of files in folders is equal to the number of files after deleting, divided by the number of files in each folder: y = f * 5

We can solve for y in either equation, and then substitute it into the other equation to get an equation with only f.

Let's solve for y in the second equation:

y = f * 5

Next, let's substitute y into the first equation and simplify:

x = (f * 5) + d

We now have an equation with only f. Let's solve for f:

f = (x - d) / 5

We can substitute the original values of x and d into this equation to calculate the number of folders Katie created:

f = (85 - 40) / 5

f = 11

{The final answer is 11}

Therefore, Katie ended up with 11 ! folders.</s>",9

<|assistant|>
To find out how much money Will made in those two days, we need to calculate his earnings on Monday and Tuesday separately and then add them up.

On Monday, Will worked for 8 hours and earned $8 per hour. Therefore, his earnings on Monday were:

8 hours at $8 per hour = $64

On Tuesday, Will worked for 2 hours. Since the text indicates that his hourly wage increased, we need more information to calculate his new wage. However, it does say that he made $8 per hour on Monday. Let's suppose that his new wage is $10 per hour. Then his earnings on Tuesday were:

2 hours at $10 per hour = $20

Adding his earnings from Monday and Tuesday, we can find out how much money Will made in those two days:

Monday earnings: $64
Tuesday earnings (if he makes $10 per hour): $20

In total, Will made:

$64 from Monday + $20 from Tuesday = $84

However, the text didn't actually say that his wage increased on Tuesday, and in fact, it says that he continued working as a sacker at the grocery store. This could imply that his original wage of $8 per hour still applied on Tuesday, which would mean that his earnings on Tuesday were actually only $16. In that case, the total money Will made in those two days would have been:

$64 from Monday + $16 from Tuesday = $80

Since we're not given enough information to be completely certain about Will's hourly wage on Tuesday, we'll leave the final answer as:

The final answer is $80 to $84.</s>",80

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can create a system of equations to represent the situations described.

Let x be the number of cupcakes Carol made in total. When she sold 6 of them and then made 27 more, she ended up with a total of x cupcakes. This can be represented by the equation:

6 + 27 = x

To find the original number of cupcakes Carol made, we can substitute this equation into the given equation:

19 = x - 6

Let's combine these two equations to make a system of equations:

6 + 27 = x (Equation 1)
19 = x - 6 (Equation 2)

Now, we can solve this system of equations using a method like Gaussian elimination or substitution to find the value of x, and then this will give us the final amount of cupcakes Carol had.

Let's use the substitution method:

First, we'll rewrite Equation 2 in terms of x:

19 = x - 6

Now, we'll replace x with the right side of Equation 1 (from Equation 1 itself) in Equation 2:

19 = (6 + 27) - 6

Simplifying this gives us:

19 = 33

However, since x should be a non-negative integer, it's not possible for x to be more than the total number of cupcakes Carol made, which we know is 19 (from the given information). Therefore, we're going to reject this solution because it's a contradiction.

As an alternative, we'll use the guess-and-check method:

Since we need 19 cupcakes, if we assume the number of cupcakes Carol sold before making more is y, then we have:

y + 27 = 19

This yields y = 2. So Carol sold 2 cupcakes at the start, leaving 17 cupcakes to make. We can find x as follows:

17 = x - 16

Adding 16 to both sides of the equation gives us:

17 + 16 = x

Lastly, we can find the number of cupcakes Carol had in total by using Equation 1:

x = 6 + 27

x = 33

Therefore, the final amount of cupcakes Carol had is 33.

{The final answer is 33.}</s>",40

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the number of team members who showed up. Since the total number of team members is 14 and 7 didn't show up, we can represent this mathematically as:

   Number of team members who showed up = 14 - 7

   Number of team members who showed up = 7

2. Next, we need to find the total number of points scored by the team members who showed up. Since each team member who showed up scored 5 points, we can represent this mathematically as:

   Total number of points scored by team members who showed up = 7 times 5 points per member

   Total number of points scored by team members who showed up = 35 points

3. Finally, we can simply add the number of points scored by the team members who showed up to the number of points scored by the team members who didn't show up (which we'll find out in the next step) to get the total number of points scored by the team:

   Total number of points scored by the team = Total number of points scored by team members who showed up + Total number of points scored by team members who didn't show up

4. To find the number of points scored by the team members who didn't show up, we can represent this as:

   Number of points scored by team members who didn't show up = (Total number of points scored by the team) - (Total number of points scored by team members who showed up)

   Number of points scored by team members who didn't show up = (Total number of points scored by the team) - 35 points

   Note that we subtracted the number of points scored by the team members who showed up, because we already accounted for those points.

5. Let's put all the pieces together and find the total number of points scored by the team:

   Total number of points scored by the team = 35 points + (Total number of points scored by the team) - 35 points

   Total number of points scored by the team = Total number of points scored by the team

6. Our final answer is:

   The total number of points scored by the team is the same as the total number of points scored by the team.

   {The final answer is: The total number of points scored by the team is [the same as the total number of points scored by the team].}

   Note that our answer is in terms of the total number of points scored by the team, which is what we wanted to find.

   By stepping through each step of our reasoning, we can ensure that our answer is correct and reasonable.</s>",35

<|assistant|>
Let's call the number of points scored by each member who showed up x.

The total number of points scored before some members didn't show up was 5 times the number of points scored by each member, or 5x points.

Now, of the 5 members, 2 did not show up, leaving 3 members who did show up. The total number of points scored by these 3 members was 3 times the number of points scored by each member who showed up, or 3x points.

Each member who did show up scored 6 points, so the number of points scored by each of the 3 team members who showed up is x = 6 points.

So before the no-shows, the team had a total of 5x points.

After the no-shows, out of the original 5 team members, 2 did not show up.

The remaining 3 team members who did show up earned a total of 6x points between them, which is the same as 3 times the number of points each member scored, or 3x points.

So in total, the team earned a total of (5x - 12) + 3x = 2x points.

Setting the two expressions for the total number of points scored equal to each other, we get:

2x = 5x - 12

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12

So each member who did show up scored 12 points, or x = 12 points.

Since there were 3 members who did show up, then the total number of points scored by the team after some members didn't show up is 3 times 12 points, or 36 points.

The final answer is:

The total number of points scored by the trivia team after some members didn't show up is 36 points.</s>",18

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller, steps.

1. First, we need to figure out how many coins (quarters or dimes) Luke had in total. We know he had 5 piles of each coin, but we don't know how many coins were in each pile. We can represent the number of coins in each pile using variables. Let's call the number of quarters in each pile q, and the number of dimes in each pile d.

2. Next, we know that each pile had 3 coins in total. We can represent this using an equation. The equation for the number of coins (c) in each pile is:

   c = q + d

   Each pile has three coins, which means q and d together make up three coins.

3. Now, we know that Luke had 5 piles of each coin. We can use another equation to represent this. The equation for the number of piles (p) we have is:

   p = 5 (for both quarters and dimes)

4. We also know that Luke put his spare change into piles, which means the total number of coins he had (tc) is the sum of the number of coins in each pile, multiplied by the number of piles. Using the variable for the number of coins in each pile, c, and the number of piles for each coin, p, we can create an equation for the total number of coins Luke had:

   tc = 5pq + 5pd

   We're representing the total number of coins as tc because we don't yet know how many coins Luke had.

5. Putting it all together, using the equations from steps 2 and 4, we get:

   q + d = 3

   And:

   tc = 5pq + 5pd

6. Now, we'll start substituting values into the equations to solve for the variables we don't know yet (in this case, q and d). Let's say there are 25 quarters in each pile, and 15 dimes in each pile. In equation form, that's q = 25 and d = 15.

7. Substitute these values into the equation we solved for in step 5. We get:

   tc = 5 * 5 * 25 + 5 * 5 * 15

   Simplifying, we get:

   tc = 150 + 75

   And:

   tc = 225

8. Now, we're ready to substitute the values we found in step 6 into our original equations. Let's start with the equation we found for the number of coins in each pile:

   q + d = 3

9. Using the values q = 25 and d = 15, we get:

   25 + 15 = 40

   Which is not possible, as we know each pile only has 3 coins. That contradicts what we discovered in step 3.

   So, we'll have to revise our guesses for q and d. Maybe there are 30 quarters in each pile, and 18 dimes in each pile? Let's see.

10. Using the new values q = 30 and d = 18, here's the equation we solved for in step 5:

   tc = 5 * 5 * 30 + 5 * 5 * 18

11. Simplifying, we get:

   tc = 180 + 108

   And:

   tc = 288

12. Let's check our work one more time by substituting our new values for q and d into the original equations. First, let's review:

   q + d = 3

13. Using the values q = 30 and d = 18, we get:

   30 + 18 = 48

14. If each pile has four dimes and fifteen quarters, then each pile has a total of 19 coins. 19 is not equal to three, but that's reasonable given our original statement. Each pile has some change, and we know that each pile has a total of three coins. So, we know that Luke put his",30

Let's set up a variable system to represent how many points Gwen and her friends earned for recycling. Let G represent the number of points Gwen earned, and let F represent the number of points Gwen's friends earned in total.

Since Gwen earned one point for every three pounds she recycled, we can set up an equation to represent this:

G = (weight recycle in pounds for Gwen) / 3

For Gwen, we know that she recycled 15 pounds. So, we can substitute this into our equation to solve for G:

G = 15 / 3

G = 5 points

Now, let's do the same for Gwen's friends. We know they recycled a total of 13 pounds. Let's say that x pounds were recycled by Gwen's friends. Then, the total weight recycled by Gwen and her friends is:

(Weight recycled by Gwen) + (Weight recycled by Gwen's friends)

15 + x = 28

(15 pounds / 3 points per pound) + (x pounds / 3 points per pound) = Total points earned

5 + x/3 = Total points earned

Let's substitute our equation for Gwen's points into this equation:

5 + x/3 = (Weight recycled by Gwen and her friends) / 3

5 + x/3 = 28 / 3

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9 points

Adding this to the 5 points earned by Gwen, we can find the total number of points earned by Gwen and her friends:

G = 5
F = x = 9

Points earned by Gwen: G = 5

Points earned by Gwen's friends: F = 9

Total points earned by Gwen and her friends: G + F = 14 points

The final answer is: Gwen and her friends earned a total of 14 points for recycling.</s>",6

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initially, George had 30 dollars. {The final answer is $30.}

2. On his birthday, George received 16 dollars more. We can find the total amount he received by adding the initial amount (30) to the additional 16 dollars. {The final answer is $46 (30 + 16).}

6. We know that there are a total of 4 regular bird cages in the store.
7. To find the total number of parakeets in all four regular bird cages, we can multiply the number of parakeets in each cage (y) by the number of regular bird cages (4).
8. By adding the total number of parakeets in the parrot cages (x) and the parakeets in the regular bird cages (from step 7), we can find the total number of parakeets in the pet store.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many boxes of chocolate candy Kaleb bought. This information is provided to us in the problem. Let's call this number ""x"". So, Kaleb bought x boxes of chocolate candy.

2. Next, we know that Kaleb gave some of these boxes to his little brother. The problem gives us this information, but it doesn't tell us how many boxes. Let's call this number ""y"". So, Kaleb gave y boxes of chocolate candy to his little brother.

3. We also know that each box has 6 pieces of chocolate candy inside it. Let's call the number of pieces in each box ""z"".

4. Now, let's calculate how many pieces of chocolate candy were in the boxes that Kaleb gave to his little brother. Since we know that there are y boxes and z pieces in each box, we can find the total number of pieces by multiplying the two: y * z.

5. Next, we know that Kaleb still had some boxes of chocolate candy left over. Let's call the number of boxes that Kaleb still had ""a"".

6. We also know that each of these remaining boxes still contained 6 pieces of chocolate candy. So, the total number of pieces in these remaining boxes is a * z.

7. Now, we can find the total number of pieces of chocolate candy that Kaleb had when we combine the ones he gave to his little brother and the ones he still had: the total number of pieces in the boxes he gave to his little brother, plus the total number of pieces in the boxes he still had. This gives us: (y * z) + (a * z).

8. Finally, the problem provides us with a little bit more information. It tells us that Kaleb bought a total of 14 boxes of chocolate candy. We can use this to make sure that the number of boxes Kaleb bought is indeed x, and that the number of boxes he still had is indeed a. If we add up the number of boxes he gave to his little brother (y) and the number of boxes he still had (a), we should get the total number of boxes he bought: x = y + a. Let's test this by equating the number of boxes Kaleb bought to the number of boxes he gave to his little brother and the number of boxes he still had: 14 = y + a.

9. Now, let's put all the pieces together. We know that Kaleb bought x boxes of chocolate candy, gave y of them to his little brother, and still had a of them. Each box contained z pieces, for a total of y * z pieces in the boxes he gave to his little brother, and a * z pieces in the boxes he still had. So, the total number of pieces of chocolate candy that Kaleb had was (y * z) + (a * z).

10. Finally, let's say the final answer is: {the total number of pieces of chocolate candy that Kaleb had is...}. When we input all the values we know, we get: {(y * z) + (a * z)} = ...

11. To find the value of y, we could use the fact that we know how many pieces Kaleb's little brother has in total (since they're his brother's pieces, we can presume that Kaleb did not eat any of them). Let's call this number ""c"". We also know that each box that Kaleb gave to his little brother contained z pieces. So, the number of pieces that Kaleb's little brother has is c = y * z.

12. Now, let's calculate the remaining numbers using the values we computed for y and c. We still have a = x - y boxes left, and z pieces in each box, so there are a * z pieces left in those boxes. So, adding up the number of pieces that are still with Kaleb (a * z) and the number of pieces that his little brother has (c), we should get the total number of pieces that Kaleb bought: (a * z) + c = x * z.

13. Now that we know how many total pieces Kaleb bought, we can solve for x. If we plug everything into the equation we got in step 12, we get: (x - y) * z + y * z = x * z. It's",54

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use some basic algebraic concepts.

Let x be the number of pictures in each album. We know that Robin sorted the pictures into 9 different albums, with the same number of pictures in each album. We also know that the total number of pictures uploaded from her phone (31) and camera (! 5) is 36.

The number of pictures uploaded from the phone can be represented as 31x, and the number of pictures uploaded from the camera can be represented as 5x. We can then find the total number of pictures uploaded by adding these two: 31x + 5x = 36.

Solving for x, we get:

x = (36 - 5x) / 31

Expanding this equation, we get:

x = 36 / (31 - 5)

x = 36 / 26

x ≈ 1.389

We cannot have a non-integer number of pictures in each album, so we can round x up to the nearest integer. Since there are 9 albums, the number of pictures in each album is approximately 14.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's represent the variables in the problem:

x = number of tables
y = cost of each table
z = cost of each chair

Maria bought 2 new chairs and x new tables for her house. This means that the total number of pieces of furniture she bought is 2 (chairs) + x (tables).

The total cost of the chairs is 2z, and the total cost of the tables is xy. The total cost of all the furniture is the sum of these two costs:

2z + xy = {The final answer is}

Now let's look at the time it took for Maria to assemble all the furniture. Since she spent 8 minutes on each piece of furniture, the total time for the chairs is 2 (chairs) * 8 (minutes per chair) = 16 (minutes). The total time taken to assemble the tables is x (tables) * 8 (minutes per table) = 8x (minutes). So the total time taken to assemble all the furniture is 16 (minutes for the chairs) + 8x (minutes for the tables).

Maria spent 8 minutes on each piece of furniture. Since she assembles everything herself, we can represent this as:

x furniture takes x * 8 = {minutes} to assemble.

Finally, let's bring together all the equations we have established, substituting their values, and solving to obtain the final answer:

2z + xy = {The final answer is}

x * 8 = {minutes}

16 + 8x = {minutes to finish}

We can solve this as a system of equations, but it is easier to think step by step. The first equation is the sum of the costs of chairs and tables, and it allows us to calculate the cost of each table, y.

The first equation is equivalent to rearranging it to become:

2z - 2y = {The final answer is}

In this version, the number of tables, x, can be expressed as a function of the variable y, to make it easier to distinguish it from z.

The second equation allows us to calculate how many tables were bought. We solve it for x:

x = {number of tables}

In this version, the time in which Maria assembled each piece of furniture is implicit. We can solve the third equation for x to obtain:

x = {number of tables}

With the above value of x and the expression for the cost of each table in terms of y, we substitute these in the expression for the total cost to obtain:

2z + xy = {The final answer is}

Now we can solve this equation for z:

z = {The final answer is}

This equation allows us to calculate the cost of each chair. Once we have calculated the value of z, we can substitute it in the expression for the total cost of chairs to calculate the final answer:

2z = {The final answer is}

Putting it all together, we finally have the equation for the time taken to finish assembling all the furniture:

16 + 8x = {minutes to finish}

Therefore, we can use this equation to substitute the value of the variable x that we obtained from the previous equations:

x = {number of tables}

16 + 8x = {minutes to finish}

Now we calculate the time it took her to finish assembling all the furniture:

{minutes to finish} = 16 + 8 {number of tables}

Finally, we add the expression for the time she took to assemble the chairs, from the definition of x:

{minutes to finish} = 16 + 8 ({number of tables})

The result we obtained for the time taken by Maria to finish assembling all the furniture is:

{minutes to finish} = {The final answer is}

This corresponds to the expression we obtained in the second equation, and it represents the total time it took Maria to finish assembling all the furniture using our assumptions.

So, the complete answer to the problem is:

The total cost of all the furniture is {The final answer is}

The number of tables bought by Maria is {number of tables}

The cost per chair is {The final answer is}

The cost per table is {The final answer is}

<|assistant|>
Let X be the number of pictures Rachel took at the zoo and Y be the number of pictures she took at the museum.

During her vacation, Rachel took a total of 6 pictures at the zoo and 9 pictures at the museum. We can represent this as an equation:

X + Y = 15

After deleting 11 pictures from the museum, Rachel now has X - 11 pictures from that location. The total number of pictures she has left from her vacation is the sum of the pictures remaining from the zoo (X - 0, since she didn't delete any zoo pictures) and the museum (X - 11).

We can write this as:

(X - 0) + (X - 11) = Total number of remaining pictures

Now we can replace the X in the second equation with the value we obtained from the first equation:

Y - 11 + (Y - 9) = Total number of remaining pictures

Next, we can combine like terms (Y and Y) and simplify:

-11 + Y - 9 = Total number of remaining pictures

Then, we'll simplify the left side further:

2Y - 20 = Total number of remaining pictures

Now, we can isolate Y by dividing both sides by 2:

Y = (Total number of remaining pictures) / 2 + 10

To find the total number of remaining pictures, let's say Rachel still has P pictures. Then we know that X and Y are portions of this total number:

X + Y = P

P is now in both the original and simplified equations above, so we can substitute these values:

(X - 0) + (X - 11) = P

Y - 11 + (Y - 9) = P

Let's substitute the simplified Y formula from above:

Y = (P - 20) / 2 + 10

Now we have two equations where Y appears:

(X - 0) + [(P - 20) / 2 + 10 - 9] = P

And:

(X - 11) + [(P - 20) / 2 + 10] = P

We can find X by setting these two expressions equal and solving for X:

X - 0 = X - 11 + [(P - 20) / 2 + 10]

X = [(P - 20) / 2 + 10] + 11

X = (P + 10) / 2 + 11

Remembering that X represents pictures taken at the zoo, we now have a formula for that number in terms of the total number of remaining pictures:

X = (P + 10) / 2 + 11

Now we can replace X with this value in the second simplified equation:

[((P + 10) / 2 + 11) - 0] + [((P - 20) / 2 + 10) - 9] = P

Let's simplify some more:

(P + 10) / 2 + (P - 11) / 2 = P - 9

Next, we'll add 9 to both sides and simplify:

(P + 10) / 2 = P - 1

Now we can isolate P by subtracting (X + 10) / 2 from both sides:

P = (X + 10) / 2 + 1

Finally, we can substitute our formula for X back into the above formula for P:

P = ((P + 10) / 2 + 11) / 2 + 1

Simplify:

(P + 10) = P + 22

Now we can subtract P from both sides:

10 = 22

Since that's obviously false, we know our assumptions were wrong somewhere along the way. At one point, we assumed that Rachel still had P pictures, which cannot possibly be true if she only has 10.

Therefore, we have no choice but to conclude that this problem has no solutions.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies that Maria has:

   * Chocolate chip cookies: 5 chocolate : chip = 10 chocolate chips and 5 chip cookies per cookie. Therefore, there are a total of 10 chocolate chips and 5 chip cookies per cookie, for a total of 15 cookies per cookie.

   * Oatmeal cookies: There are 19 oatmeal cookies in total.

   So, the total number of cookies that Maria has is:

   (15 cookies per cookie) (number of cookies) + 19 oatmeal cookies

   Let x be the number of cookies that Maria has.

   x = (15 cookies per cookie) (number of cookies) + 19 oatmeal cookies

2. Calculate how many cookies there are in each bag:

   * Each bag has 8 cookies, which are a mix of chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies.

3. Calculate how many chocolate chip cookies and how many oatmeal cookies are in each bag:

   * Let y be the number of chocolate chip cookies in each bag.

   * Let z be the number of oatmeal cookies in each bag.

   * The number of chocolate chip cookies in each bag is:

   (5 chocolate : chip) (y chocolate chip cookies) = 5 z chip cookies, where z is the number of chip cookies in each bag.

   * The number of oatmeal cookies in each bag is:

   z = 8 - y - z (chip cookies) - z (oatmeal cookies), where y is the number of chocolate chip cookies in each bag.

   Substituting 5z into this formula gives:

   z = 8 - y - (5z / 10) (oatmeal cookies)

   Simplify this by multiplying both sides by 10 / 5 to eliminate the fraction:

   z = (80 - 10y) / 9 (oatmeal cookies)

4. Calculate how many bags Maria can make:

   * Let r be the number of bags that Maria can make.

   * The number of cookies in r bags is:

   r (number of cookies per bag) = x (total number of cookies)

   Substituting 8 cookies per bag and the formula for the number of cookies in the previous steps gives:

   r = x / (15 cookies per cookie + (80 - 10y) / 9 (oatmeal cookies)) (number of bags Maria can make)

5. Determine how many bags Maria can make:

   Substitute the values for x, y, and z into Step 4 and simplify:

   Let x = 60, y = 24, and z = 15.

   r = 60 / (15 + (80 - 10 * 24) / 9) (number of bags Maria can make)

   Simplify and calculate:

   r ≈ 18 (number of bags Maria can make)

   Therefore, {Maria can make approximately 18 bags}.</s>",3

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first identify the unknown quantity and the known quantities. The unknown quantity is the total amount spent by Zoe, and the known quantities are the price of each rose and daisy during the sale, as well as the number of roses and daisies purchased by Zoe.

Let's break this down into steps:

1. Each rose is $3 (the price of each flower is marked as !3 dollars) during the sale.
2. Each daisy is also $3 during the sale, because it was also marked with an exclamation point.
3. Zoe bought 8 roses (this quantity is also marked with an exclamation point, indicating a discount).
4. Zoe also bought 2 daisies (once again, this quantity is also marked with an exclamation point).

The total number of flowers purchased by Zoe is the sum of the number of roses and daisies:

Number of flowers = 8 roses + 2 daisies = 10 flowers

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the flowers:

Cost of 1 rose = $3
Cost of 1 daisy = $3

Cost of all 8 roses = 8 * $3 = $24
Cost of all 2 daisies = 2 * $3 = $6

Total cost of flowers = $24 + $6 = $30

However, we know that Zoe bought these flowers during the sale, which were discounted. This means we need to find out the percentage of discount received. If we see the price before discounting, we can calculate the percentage of discount by finding the difference between the regular and reduced prices, then finding the percentage of change.

Price of 1 rose (regular price) = $x
Price after discount (reduced price) = $3

Difference = $x - $3

Percentage of change (discount) = ($x - $3) / $x * 100%

Let's find the value of x:

3 = (x - 0.9x) / 1

3 = 1 - 0.9

0.1x = 0

As there is no value in x, there seems to be an error in the question or it's missing information which we can't solve with given information.

Therefore, since we are not able to determine the reduced price of rose, we cannot calculate the total cost of flowers during the sale, and thus we cannot determine how much Zoe spent in total.

Final answer: We are unable to determine how much Zoe spent as we do not have enough information to calculate the total cost of flowers during the sale.</s>",30

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's start by figuring out how many books are on each shelf for the mystery and picture books.

For the mystery books, Bianca has 5 shelves with each shelf holding 8 books. This gives us a total of 5 times 8, or 40, mystery books on these 5 shelves.

For the picture books, Bianca has 4 shelves with each shelf holding an unknown number of books. Let's call this unknown number x.

We want the total number of books to be the same, regardless of whether they are mystery or picture books. Here's where we can use a system of equations to find the value of x.

First equation: The total number of mystery books is 40. Call this number M. We can express this as:

M = 5 * 8

Second equation: Bianca wants exactly 8 books on each shelf, so each shelf of mystery books and picture books has 8 books.

For the mystery books, this is:

5 * 8 = 40

For the picture books, this is:

4 * x = 8 * 4

By solving the second equation, we find that x must equal 10.

Now that we know how many books are on each shelf for both the mystery and picture books, we can see that Bianca has a total of 80 books (5 shelves at 8 books each for the mystery books, plus 4 shelves at 10 books each for the picture books).

Here's our final answer: 

Bianca has a total of 80 books after organizing her collection with exactly 8 books on each shelf. {The final answer is 80 books.}</s>",72

                    question:
                    ;  , John was organizing his baseball ; cards in a binder with 3 ? on each page. If he . had 8 new ! cards and ; 16 ! old cards to : put ? in the binder, how many ? pages would he use? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break down this problem and solve it step by step:

1. We first need to find how many total cards John has. For the old cards, we know that each page has 3? and there are 16 pages. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of old cards as follows:
   Number of old cards = 3? * Number of pages = 3? * 16 = 48?
2. Now we know how many old cards John has, we can figure out the number of new cards he now has in total. We are given that John has 8 new ! cards, on top of the old cards. This tells us that there are now a total of 8 new ! cards and the number of old cards we found earlier (48?). The total number of new and old cards would be:
    Total number of cards = 48? + 8 new ! cards
   To make this easier to calculate, let's call the number of all the cards John has ""N"". We can now build our equation, substituting ""N"" for our total number of cards:
   Total number of cards = N
3. Using the given information that John organizes his cards in a binder with 3? on each page, we can calculate how many pages he needs to hold all his cards. One page holds 3? cards, and we now know how many cards John has in total (which we've called ""N""). Let's call the number of pages needed to hold all John's cards ""P"". Our calculation would be:
   Number of pages = N / 3? = P
4. We have now found the total number of pages John needs to hold all his cards. However, we also know that some of these pages will be full of new cards and some will be full of old cards. Let's separate the number of pages needed to hold the new cards from the pages needed to hold the old cards.
   Let ""P1"" be the number of pages needed to hold the new cards, and ""P2"" be the number of pages needed to hold the old cards (the ones that were full of cards before John got the new cards). Since we've just found that John needs ""P"" pages in total, we can calculate the number of pages needed to hold the new cards as:
   Number of pages needed for new cards = P1
   Number of pages needed for old cards = P - P1 = P2
5. Now that we have the number of pages needed to hold the new cards (""P1"") and the number needed to hold the old cards (""P2""), we know how many new and old cards John needs to put onto each page to reach their respective page quotas. Let's call the number of new cards that John puts onto each page ""n"". Similarly, let's call the number of old cards that John puts onto each page ""o"".
   Number of new cards per page = n
   Number of old cards per page = o
6. We now have all the information needed to answer the question. John needs to put ""n"" new cards and ""o"" old cards onto each page. We know that each page has 3? spaces. Let's call the sum of new and old cards per page ""q"" (as we can calculate the number of spaces needed per page based on the number of new cards and the number of old cards):
   q = n + o
7. Let's find the value of ""q"". We know that each page has 3? spaces on it. Therefore, the number of spaces needed for all pages (""S"") would be:
    Number of spaces = q * Number of pages required = q * P
8. We've now figured out the number of spaces John needs for all his cards. We also know that each space can hold one card. Let's call the number of cards needed to fill all the spaces ""C"". Again, we can use our equation ""C=S"" to find the value of ""C"":
    Number of cards = C = S
9. Finally, we put everything together. We know that John has ""N"" cards, and we've found that the number of cards he needs to fill all the spaces (""C"") is equal to the total number of spaces (""S""). This tells us that the number of cards John has (""N"") and the number of cards he needs to fill all the spaces (""C"") are equal:
    Total number of cards = N = C

To summarize, the final answer is: John needs ""C"" pages (each containing ""q"" cards,",8

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's first simplify the expression ""! 3 brownies"". The symbol ""!"" is an exclamation mark and does not have a mathematical meaning in this context. Let's assume it is a typo and replace it with a number, let's say 6.

Isabel originally planned to bake 6 brownies, but she now needs a total of 5 brownies for her party. This means she needs to bake an additional 1 brownie to reach the total number of brownies required.

If she uses 5 cups of flour for every batch of 6 brownies, let's call this quantity x cups. To find the number of cups of flour she needs for the party, we know she needs 5 brownies, each requiring x cups of flour.

First, calculate the total number of cups of flour she needs for the original 6 brownies:

6 brownies * x cups = original cups of flour

Next, calculate the number of cups of flour required for the remaining brownie:

1 brownie * x cups = remaining cups of flour

Add the original and remaining cups of flour to get the total number of cups of flour needed for the party:

original cups of flour + remaining cups of flour = total cups of flour

Putting it all together:

6 brownies * x cups = original cups of flour
x cups = remaining cups of flour [obtained from calculating the remaining brownie]
Total cups of flour = original cups of flour + remaining cups of flour [obtained from calculating the total number of cups required for the party]

Let's substitute our calculated values into the equation we got from ""Total cups of flour"":

6 * x = original cups of flour
x = remaining cups of flour

x + 6x = Total cups of flour
11x = Total cups of flour [obtained from combining the two calculated equations]
Finally, solve for x:

11x = Total cups of flour
x = Total cups of flour / 11

The final answer is the required number of cups of flour for the party, which is Total cups of flour / 11.</s>",10

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Find out how many cupcakes Maria made for the school bake sale, denoted by x.
   - Given: For : the school bake sale Maria made 19 cupcakes.
   - Therefore, x = 19.

2. Maria sold 5 out of the total number of cupcakes made. Denote this as y.
   - Given: If ; she sold 5 of them.
   - Therefore, y = x/2 = 19/2 = 9.5 (Maria cannot physically make half a cupcake, so let's round down).

3. After selling these cupcakes, Maria made 10 more.
   - Let's denote the total number of cupcakes sold and made as z.
   - Given: Then made 10 more.
   - Therefore, z = y + 10.
   - Substituting the value of y, z = 9 + 10 = 19.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. First, we're given the total number of tickets bought by Tom at the state fair, which is 40.
2. Next, we know that Tom spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth. We can represent this using the equation:
   - 28 = 40 (number of tickets bought) - (number of tickets spent at 'dunk a clown')
   - Subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation, we get:
   - -28 = -40 (number of tickets spent at 'dunk a clown')
   - Dividing both sides by -4 yields:
   - 7 = (number of tickets spent at 'dunk a clown')
   - The value is 7, which can't be a realistic number of tickets spent at a booth. So we'll assume that there is a typo here and change the number of tickets spent at 'dunk a clown' to a more realistic number. Let's say Tom spent 12 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth.
3. Tom decided to use the remaining tickets on rides. We don't know the exact number of remaining tickets, but we know that Tom spent 4 tickets on each ride, and we also know that Tom used all his remaining tickets on rides. So, we can represent this using the equation:
   - (Number of tickets remaining) = (Number of rides) * 4 (number of tickets used on rides)
4. Let's say Tom rode N rides. We can substitute this value into the equation we created in step 3 to get:
   - (Number of tickets remaining) = N * 4
5. Now, we want to find the number of rides Tom could go on with the remaining tickets. To do this, we'll combine steps 2 and 4:
   - (Number of tickets remaining) = (Number of tickets bought) - (Number of tickets spent at 'dunk a clown') - (Number of tickets used on rides)
   - Substituting step 3 into this equation:
   - (N * 4) = 40 - 12 - (N * 4)
   - Then, subtracting twice (N * 4) from both sides:
   - 0 = 40 - 28
   - This is clearly wrong, so we know that the number of tickets we assumed Tom spent at 'dunk a clown' wasn't correct. Since a more realistic value ranges from 0 to around 10, let's assume that Tom spent 7 tickets there, and saw a dunking of 7 clowns.
   - Repeating steps 3 and 5 with this new assumption:
   - (Number of tickets remaining) = N * 4
   - (Number of tickets remaining) = 40 - 12 - 7 - (N * 4)
   - Then solving for N using algebraic manipulation:
   - (N * 4) = 40 - 29
   - N = (40 - 29) / 4
   - N = 5.25
   - Since this isn't a whole number, it's not a realistic answer. So, let's round up N to the next whole number, which is 6.
6. Therefore, Tom went on 6 rides using all his remaining tickets (4 left for rides, minus 7 already spent at the 'dunk a clown' booth, equals 33 total tickets left, which is sufficient for 6 rides). 
   - If you want to know how many tickets were used in total, you can simply sum up the tickets used at all places:
   - 40 (tickets bought) - 12 (tickets spent at 'dunk a clown') - 21 (29 - 8 in clowns) = 8 tickets unaccounted for
   - So we got 45 tickets used in total.
   - The final answer is: Tom went on 6 rides using all his remaining tickets (40 - 12 - 21 = 8 tickets unaccounted for).

During the second year, 11 new students came to the school. Let's represent this by adding 11 to the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the first year.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let x be the number of green towels that Maria has left after giving her mother 34 of them.
2. We know that Maria bought 35 green towels. When she gives her mother 34 of them, she is left with x green towels. So, we can set up an equation: 35 - 34 = x 
  
  Solving for x:
  
  35 - 34 = x
  
  35 - 35 (subtracting the same number from both sides) = 34
  
  0 = 34
  
  This is a contradiction, as zero is not a possible solution. This equation has no unique solution for x, meaning that we could not have left with a specific number of green towels. This is because we gave our mother more green towels than we had remaining after shopping.
  
  Since we cannot have a specific number of green towels left, let's assume that we have zero green towels left (since we gave all of them away).
  
2. Now that we have zero green towels left, let's find out how many white towels Maria ended up with.
  
  Let y be the number of white towels that Maria has left after giving her mother 34 of them.
  
  We know that Maria bought 21 white towels, and she gave away 34 of them (including both white and green towels), so we don't necessarily have to separate the white towels she gave away. But to simplify the equation, we can subtract the 34 green towels we gave away from the total number of white towels Maria bought, and call the remaining white towels y.
  
  There is a slight complication in that we gave our mother some green towels, which were included in the 34 towels she gave away, but this should not make a difference since the question only asks about white and green towels separately.
  
  We can now calculate y:
  
  35 + 21 - 34 = y  
  
  Combining like terms:
  
  56 - 34 = y   
  
  Solving for y:
  
  56 - 34 = y   
  
  22 = y  
  
  The final answer is: Maria ended up with 22 white towels.</s>",22

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find Adam's final score, we first need to determine the number of correct answers he had in both the first half and second half of the trivia game. Adam answered 8 : questions correct in the first half, so we can set up an equation where x is the number of correct answers in the first half:

8 : x = correct answers in first half

We are also given that Adam answered 2 : questions correct in the second half, so we can set up a second equation with y representing the number of correct answers in the second half:

8 : y = correct answers in second half

Now, we can use the fact that Adam answered a total of 16 questions correctly (8 : questions correct in first half and 2 : questions correct in second half) in the entire game. Let's call this number z. We can set that up as an equation:

x + y = z

We have three equations and three unknowns (x, y, and z), so let's sub in the first equation into the third equation:

8 : x + 8 : y = 8 : 16 : questions answered correctly

We can divide both sides by 8 points to simplify:

x/1 : y/1 = 1/2

Since this is a proportion, we can easily cross-multiply to set up a system of equations:

x = y/2
y = 2x

Let's now plug these into the previous equations we derived, using the new equivalences:

8 : (2x) = correct answers in second half
8 : x = correct answers in first half

Now, we want to find x, which we can do by solving for correct answers in the first half (x):

8 : x = correct answers in first half
8 : (2x) = correct answers in second half

We want to make it so that the second equation is in terms of x, just like in the first equation. So, let's multiply both sides of that equation by two to get rid of the fraction and set y equal to the result:

y = 2(8 : (2x))

Now, let's substitute this for y in the original equation we found:

8 : x + 8 : (2(8 : (2x))) = 8 : 32 : questions answered correctly

Let's simplify this by dividing both sides by 8:

x/1 + (2x)/16 = (32x)/128

Now, we need to solve for x in the simplified equation:

128x = 32x

We can cancel out x to solve for x:

128 = 32

We can't actually solve for x, since this is a false equivalence. However, we know that for each correct answer in the second half, Adam had twice as many correct answers in the first half. Let's call this constant k:

correct answers in second half : k = correct answers in first half : 2k

Using our original equations, we now know that if Adam answered a total of 16 questions correctly, then he answered k questions incorrectly in the second half, and (2k) questions correctly in the first half. Therefore, his score for the first half would be:

8 : questions answered in first half = (k * 8) = score for the first half

And, his score for the second half would be:

8 : questions answered incorrectly in second half - 8 = score for the second half

Adding those two scores together, we get Adam's final score:

final score = score for the first half + score for the second half

To summarize, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Set up equations based on the information provided (x, y, z).
2. Cross-multiply to simplify and set up a system of equations (x, y).
3. Substitute the new x and y into the original equations to find the final score.
4. Find a constant k that relates the answers in the first half to the answers in the second half (x, y).
5. Use the simplified equations to calculate Adam's score for the first half and second half.
6. Add those scores together to find Adam's final score.

The final answer is:

Let's call the number of cans Paul picked up on Saturday x, and the number of cans he picked up on Sunday y.

On Saturday, Paul filled 6 bags with each bag containing 8 cans. Therefore, the total number of cans Paul collected on Saturday is:

6 bags times 8 cans per bag equals 48 cans in total.

So, on Saturday, Paul picked up a total of x cans.

On Sunday, Paul filled 3 more bags with each bag containing 8 cans. Since he filled 3 bags, the total number of cans he collected on Sunday is:

3 bags times 8 cans per bag equals 24 cans in total.

So, on Sunday, Paul picked up a total of y cans.

Let's add up the total number of cans Paul collected over both days. On Saturday, he picked up x cans, and on Sunday, he picked up y cans. In total, we have:

x cans on Saturday, and y cans on Sunday.

To find the total number of cans collected by Paul, we add x and y:

x cans on Saturday, and y cans on Sunday... For a total of (x + y) cans collected by Paul.

Combining our work above:

6 bags times 8 cans per bag equals 48 cans on Saturday. Paul also picked up x total cans on Saturday, so we can find x:

48 cans on Saturday, and x cans picked up by Paul on Saturday... For a total of x + 48 cans.

Let's subtract the known values:

48 cans collected on Saturday, which leaves us with x = ? cans that Paul picked up on Saturday.

We can now find the total number of cans Paul collected by adding x and y:

x cans Paul picked up on Saturday, and y cans Paul picked up on Sunday... For a total of (x + y) cans.

The final answer is: (x + y) cans.

If we know that Paul picked up a total of 64 cans over the weekend, we can set our previous expression equal to 64:

(x + y) cans equals 64... Our expression represents the total number of cans that Paul picked up over both days.

From this, we can set each variable equal to 64 and solve for x and y:

x + y = 64

Let's separate this into two equations by subtracting y from both sides:

x = 64 - y... And y represents the number of cans Paul picked up on Sunday.

Let's substitute our expression for y into the first equation:

x = 64 - (number of cans Paul picked up on Sunday)... And x represents the number of cans Paul picked up on Saturday.

Now let's find the exact number of cans Paul picked up on Saturday and Sunday by choosing a few options for the number of cans Paul picked up on Sunday:

First, let's say Paul picked up 24 cans on Sunday. Let's calculate what this means for the number of cans he picked up on Saturday:

x = 64 - 24

x = 40

So on Saturday, Paul picked up 40 cans.

Now let's say Paul picked up 32 cans on Sunday:

x = 64 - 32

x = 32

So on Saturday, Paul picked up 32 cans.

Finally, let's say Paul picked up 16 cans on Sunday:

x = 64 - 16

x = 48

So on Saturday, Paul picked up 48 cans.

In each case, we see that the expressions for both x and y, the number of cans Paul picked up on each day, are whole numbers. This matches the instructions given to us in the problem, and tells us that Paul certainly did not pick up negative numbers of cans.

Therefore, our answers are valid, and Paul collected a total of 64 cans over the weekend - 48 cans on Saturday and either 16, 32 or 48 cans on Sunday.

The final answer is: 48 or 32 or ",72

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the variables:
   - n is the number of Bianca's friends
   - l is the weight (in pounds) of paper that each friend recycles
   - a is the weight (in pounds) that Bianca recycles
   
   - p is the points earned for every 3 pounds recycled
   - x is the total points earned

2. Set up a system of equations based on the given information:
   
   - Bianca's friends each recycled l pounds and Bianca recycled a pounds, so in total they recycled (l + a) pounds. Using the given formula for earning points, they earned (l + a) / 3 points.
   
   - Bianca recycled a pounds, so in total they recycled (a + l*n) pounds. Using the given formula for earning points, they earned (a + l*n) / 3 points.
   
   - Substitute the equations we just found for the total points earned into the second equation to eliminate one of the variables, n, and form a new equation:

   - (a + l*n) / 3 = (l + a) / 3 + b (where b is a constant that we'll solve for later)

   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fractions and make the equation easier to work with:

   - a + l*n = l + a + 3b

3. Simplify and solve for n:
   
   - Subtract a from both sides:

   - l*n = a + 3b

   - Divide by l and rearrange to solve for n:

   - n = (a + 3b) / l

4. Substitute the values we know into this equation and solve for n:
   
   - First, let's find out how many pounds Bianca's friends recycled: 3 pounds total divided by the number of friends, n. So l = 3 / n.
   
   - We know that Bianca recycled 24 pounds, so a = 24. We also know that Bianca's friends earned b points for recycling, but we don't yet know what that value is.
   
   - Substitute these values (and their equivalents in terms of n) into our equation for n:

   - n = (24 + 3b) / (3 / n)
   
   - Multiply both sides by (3 / n) to get rid of the fraction:

   - n^2 = 8 + 9b

   - Divide both sides by 9 (and multiply by the square root of both sides to remove the negative square root):

   - n = ±√(n^2/9) + (8/9)
   
   - The ± arises because the square root is not unique. We don't know whether our value for n is positive or negative, but we know that n can't really be negative, or else the friends would each be recycling more than the total weight recycled (which doesn't make sense). Therefore, we're left with the positive square root:

   - n = √(n^2/9) + (8/9)

   - To find b (and therefore, the points earned by Bianca's friends), we can rearrange the equation we found for n to get an equation with n and b on their own:

   - (a + 3b) / l = n
   
   - First, let's find a value for l: each friend recycles 3 pounds, so let's assume there's one friend, and we'll find out how many friends later. Then l = 3:
   
   - We already found values for a and n from the previous steps: a = 24 and n = √(n^2/9) + (8/9).

   - Now we're ready to find b:
   
   - Plug the values for a, n, and l into our equation for b:

   - b = (n*(a + l*n)) / 3

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can approach it in the following steps:

1. There are a total of 3 friends in the group, so the initial number of chicken wings in the restaurant is 8, which means each friend initially has 2 and 2/3 wings (8 wings divided equally among 3 friends). So when we find out how many wings each friend gets in the end, we can deduct the initial 2 and 2/3 wings to get the final number of wings each friend gets.

2. The chef originally had 8 chicken wings cooked. Later, the chef cooked an additional 10 wings for the group of 3 friends. So in total, there are now 18 chicken wings (8 original wings + 10 additional wings). Each friend now gets the same amount of chicken wings, so let's find out how many wings each friend receives:

3. Let's say that each friend gets x wings in total. If we deduct the original 2 and 2/3 wings each friend had (initial wings), we are left with the new number of wings the friends received from the chef (x wings).

4. When deducting the initial 2 and 2/3 wings, we must use integer subtraction for whole numbers and decimal subtraction for decimal numbers. Therefore, the equation becomes:

    x - 2 - 2/3 = 18

5. We need to isolate the variable x on this side of the equation. To do this, add 2 and 2/3 to both sides of the equation:

    x = 18 + 2 + 2/3

6. The final equation looks like this:

    x = 20 + 2/3

7. At this point, however, we cannot simplify the right side of the equation because 2 and 2/3 cannot be simplified into a single whole number. So instead, let's change our thinking - what fraction of the original 18 wings does each friend get now, rather than how many wings each friend gets in total?

8. Let's define the fraction of remaining wings that each friend gets as y. We can relate y to x using the fact that there are now 18 remaining wings after the original 8 wings (since 18 equals 8 original wings + 10 additional wings).

9. Using our definition of y and rearranging the original equation to find x in terms of y and x0 (the original number of wings that each friend got), we get:

    x = x0 + 18 * y

10. Let's define x0 as 2 and 2/3 to determine how many remaining wings each friend gets. Using our steps from before, we get:

    y = {the final answer is}

11. Now that we have an equation to relate x0, 18, and y, we want to find how many wings each friend gets in terms of a whole number of wings. So we can again let x0 = 2, replace 18 with the equation we found in step 9 (x = x0 + 18 * y), and simplify.

12. Here's our final answer:

        Each friend gets 2 whole wings plus 2/3 of the remaining wings (y * 18). So when we simplify the equation that we found, we get:

        y = {number of remaining wings each friend gets, expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1}. Therefore, each friend gets:

        (2 whole wings + y * 18 remaining wings) = {total number of wings each friend gets}.

Let ""x"" be the number of socks John had initially.

Given condition: John had 33 socks.

We can express this as an equation:

33 = x

Now, John threw away 19 old socks that didn't fit. Let's call the number of socks John had after throwing them away ""y"".

Let's represent this mathematically:

y = x - 19

After throwing away old socks that didn't fit, John bought 13 new socks. Let ""z"" be the number of new socks John bought.

Let's say ""h"" is the total number of socks John has after buying new ones.

Equation: h = y + z

So,

h = (x - 19) + 13

Let's substitute the expressions of ""x"" and ""y"" to solve for ""h"".

h = (33 - 19) + 13

h = 24 + 13
 
h = 37

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Let the total number of players in the baseball team be x.
2. The team had 2 new players. Therefore, the number of new players is 2.
3. The team had 6 returning players. Therefore, the number of returning players is 6.
4. Let the number of players put into a group (except the new players) be y.
5. As each group has 4 players, we can say:

   Number of players in each group = 4

6. The number of groups is found by dividing the total number of players by the number of players in each group.

   Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group

7. Since there are new players, we need to exclude them from the calculation of the number of groups.

8. The coach put y (returning players) players into groups. Therefore, the total number of returning players in groups is y times the number of groups.

   Number of returning players in groups = y * Number of groups

9. The calculation of the total number of returning players is:

   Total number of returning players = Number of returning players (from step 3) - Returning players in groups (from step 8)

10. We know the total number of returning players, so we can equation (1) below to find the number of returning players in groups.

   Total number of returning players = Number of returning players in groups + Number of new players

11. Rearrange equation (1) to solve for the number of returning players in groups (step 8).

   Equation: Number of returning players in groups = Total number of returning players - Number of new players

12. Insert this equation into equation (2).

   Equation: Total number of players = (Total number of returning players - Number of new players) + (Number of new players * 2) + y * Number of groups

13. Simplify equation (3) by rearranging and putting like terms together.

14. We can now find the number of groups by separating the equation into terms containing x (the total number of players) and y (the number of players put into a group).

15. To isolate x, we divide equation (4) by the number of players put into a group. This gives us equation (5), with the final answer clearly marked by ending with {The final answer is}.

   Equation: The final answer is x = (Total number of returning players - Number of new players) / (1 - (Number of new players) / y) * y

Here's the step-by-step breakdown in detail:

1. Let the total number of players be x.

2. The team had 2 new players. Therefore, the number of new players is 2.

3. The team had 6 returning players. Therefore, the number of returning players is 6.

4. Let the number of players put into a group (except the new players) be y.

5. As each group has 4 players, we can say:

   Number of players in each group = 4

6. The number of groups is found by dividing the total number of players by the number of players in each group.

   Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group

7. Since there are new players, we need to exclude them from the calculation of the number of groups.

8. The coach put y (returning players) players into groups. Therefore, the total number of returning players in groups is y times the number of groups.

   Number of returning players in groups = y * Number of groups

9. We know the total number of returning players, so we can use equation (1) below to find the number of returning players in groups.

   Total number of returning players = Number of returning players in groups + Number of new players

10. Rearrange equation (1) to solve for the number of returning players in groups (step 8).

   Equation: Number of returning players in groups = Total number of returning players - Number of new players

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many rooms the painter has left to paint. Since we know he has already painted 2 rooms, we can subtract this from the total number of rooms (6) to find the number of unpainted rooms.

6 rooms total
2 rooms painted already
4 rooms still need to be painted

Next, we can find out how many total hours the painter has already spent painting. Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, we can add up the number of hours spent on the first 2 rooms to find this:

2 rooms at 5 hours each = 10 hours total

Now we know that the painter has already spent 10 hours painting, and he's currently working on the remaining 4 rooms. We need to determine how many hours it will take to paint these remaining rooms, and then add that to the 10 hours he's already spent to find out how much longer he'll be painting in total.

First, we can calculate the number of hours it will take to paint the remaining 4 rooms. Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, we can multiply 5 hours by 4 rooms to find the total number of hours it will take to paint the remaining rooms:

4 rooms at 5 hours each = 20 hours total

Now we can add this to the 10 hours he's already spent painting to find out how many total hours he'll have spent painting by the time he's finished:

10 hours already spent + 20 hours for the remaining rooms = 30 total hours spent painting

We can convert these total hours into a time equivalent using the number of hours in a day (24) and the number of days in a week (7):

30 total hours spent painting / (24 hours in a day * 7 days in a week) = approximately 1 week and 4 days

So if the painter continues to work at a rate of 1 room per 5 hours, it will take him approximately 1 week and 4 days to finish painting the remaining rooms, at which point he will have spent a total of approximately 1 week and 4 days painting the entire building.

The final answer is: it will take the painter approximately 1 week and 4 days to finish painting the entire building, starting from when he began work on the remaining rooms. The exact amount of time will depend on the day of the week he starts working on the remaining rooms.</s>",20

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the number of customers in the waiter's section as 22, which can be written as an equation:

x = 22

After 14 customers left, the number of remaining customers is represented by the equation:

y = x - 14

We can substitute x = 22 into this equation to find y:

y = 22 - 14

y = 8

Next, there are k tables in the waiter's section, with 4 people at each table. Using this information, we can represent the number of people at all of the tables as:

4k = x

Substituting x = 22 into this equation, we can find k:

4k = 22

k = 5.5

Since we can't have half a table, we know that the waiter had 6 tables in total. Therefore, we can represent the number of people at these 6 tables as:

4(6) = 24

This is greater than the number of remaining customers after some left (y = 8). This means that there might be additional customers at each table, which we will call z people. 

Using this new value, we can represent the total number of people as:

4k + 6z = y + z

We can substitute values from our previous equations to get:

4(6) + 6z = 8 + z

We can solve for z:

z = 12

As a result, there are 12 additional customers (z), bringing the total number of customers to 8 + 12, or 20. This is more than the 22original number of customers (x). This means that there is a mistake in the problem, as this number (x) does not represent the correct number of customers in the waiter's section.

However, since we know that y (the remaining number of customers) is 8, we can still work out how many tables there are with:

y = x - 14

x = y + 14

k = (x - 14)/4

When x = 8, this gives us the correct number of tables:

k = 2

So, we can represent the original number of customers as:

k(4) = y

Using what we know (k = 2, y = 8), we can find the original number of customers:

8 = 16(2)

This gives us that the original number of customers must be 16, rather than 22.

The final answer is:

x = 16

k = 2

z = 0 (as we found earlier with the 14 customers that left)

y = 8

And now we can represent the number of people as:

4(2) = 8

This matches the remaining number of customers (y) with no additional customers at each table (z).

{The final answer is: the waiter had 16 customers, 2 tables with 4 people at each table, and 8 customers remained after 14 left}.</s>",2

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Roger had 120 pieces of clothing to wash. Let's call this number x.
2. Roger put 48 pieces of clothing in one load to wash. This means that x-48 pieces remained.
3. Roger decided to split the remaining x-48 pieces into 9 equal loads.
4. Let's call the number of pieces in each small load y. Then, each small load should contain (x-48)/9 pieces.
5. We need to find the value of y. First, we can write an equation for the total number of pieces (large and small loads) after washing:
   120 = 48 (large load) + 9(y) (small loads)

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of input and output. Input refers to the number of students at the beginning, and output refers to the number of students at the end.

Input: There were 10 students in fourth grade at the beginning of the year.

Output 1: Four students left the school.

Let the number of students who left be x. So, we can write this in terms of x as follows:

x = 4 (Input - Output)

x = 4(-4)

x = -16

But we can't have a negative amount of students leaving, so this output is wrong. We can conclude that the output should be zero since the input already accounted for these students leaving.

Input: 42 new students came to the school.

Let the number of students who arrived be y. So, we can write this in terms of y as follows:

y = 42

Output 2: Add the students who arrived and the students who stayed.

Let the total number of students be z after considering the students who arrived and left. So, we can write this in terms of z as follows:

z = x + y + (Input - x)

z = 0 + 42 + (10 - 0)

z = 42

We got the exact number of students (42) present at the end. Therefore, the final answer is as follows:

{The final answer is} 42. 

This problem exemplifies situations where the input and output do not necessarily have to be positive numbers. Our calculations showed results as expected mathematically. However, the practicality of the calculation can lead different interpretations, such as considering that the input of ""4 students left"" actually means 4 students did not continue in the same grade or perhaps transferred to other schools. Since the original input and outputs are vague, we can interpret them according to the logic that we understand best.

<|assistant|>
To find out how many extra flowers Bianca picked when she used only 81 tulips for her flower bouquets, we can set up a system of equations using the given information.

Let x be the number of additional flowers Bianca picked, excluding tulips and roses.

We know that Bianca picked a total of 39 tulips and 49 roses for her flower bouquets. The number of flowers she picked in total is the sum of the tulips, roses, and additional flowers.

39 tulips + 49 roses + x = total number of flowers

We also know that Bianca only used 81 tulips for her bouquets, leaving us with the following equation:

81 = 39 (number of tulips for bouquets) + (number of tulips remaining)

We can use this equation to find out how many tulips Bianca has left over after picking 39 for her bouquets.

81 - 39 = 42 (number of tulips remaining)

Plugging this into our first equation, we can find how many additional flowers Bianca picked (excluding tulips and roses).

39 + 49 + x = total number of flowers

81 + 42 - (39 + 49) = x (number of additional flowers)

Simplifying, we get:

x = 2 (number of additional flowers)

Therefore, Bianca picked an additional 2 flowers, excluding tulips and roses, for a total of 39 tulips, 49 roses, and 2 additional flowers, making a total of 88 flowers picked.

The final answer is: Bianca picked a total of 88 flowers, including 39 tulips and 49 roses. She picked an additional 2 flowers on top of those, making a grand total of 88 flowers.

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the amount spent on each chair (C), each table (T), and each minute spent on putting furniture together (m) in dollars.

Emily bought a total of 4 chairs and 2 tables, so:

C × 4 chairs = $4C
T × 2 tables = $2T

Now, let's find the total amount Emily spent on furniture (F) and the total amount of time she spent putting furniture together (t).

F = C × 4 chairs + T × 2 tables
F = $4C + $2T

We know that Emily spent 8 minutes per piece of furniture putting it together, so:

m × (4 chairs + 2 tables) = 8m

m × (6 furniture items) = 48m

We can substitute this into the formula for t, which is the total time spent putting furniture together.

t = m × (6 furniture items)
t = 48m

Finally, we can find an expression for the amount of time it took to finish, by adding the total time spent putting furniture together to the total time she spent on furniture purchases.

tFinish = t + (C × 4 chairs) + (T × 2 tables)
tFinish = 48m + $4C × 4/60 (minutes per dollar) + $2T × 2/60 (minutes per dollar)
tFinish = [48m + $4C/3 + $2T/3]

To indicate the final answer, we can write:

<|assistant|>
To find the total number of birds at the pet store, we need to count the number of parrots and parakeets in all the cages.

Let's first find the number of parrots. Since there are 6 cages, and each cage has 2 parrots, there are 2 * 6 = 12 parrots in total.

Now let's find the number of parakeets. For every cage, we know that there are 7 parakeets. So in total, the number of parakeets is 7 * 6 = 42.

Adding the number of parrots and parakeets, we get the total number of birds at the pet store:

12 parrots + 42 parakeets = 54 birds in total {The final answer is}.</s>",54

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the total number of short sleeve shirts as x and the total number of long sleeve shirts as y.

Original number of short sleeve shirts: x
Original number of long sleeve shirts: y
Number of short sleeve shirts washed: 9
Number of long sleeve shirts washed: 27

We can write this information using equations:
x - 9 = original number of short sleeve shirts (before washing)
x - 9 = 9 (shirts washed)
x = 18 (short sleeve shirts after washing)

y - 27 = original number of long sleeve shirts (before washing)
y - 27 = 27 (shirts washed)
y = 34 (long sleeve shirts after washing)

Now we know how many shirts were washed, let's find out how many weren't washed. Here, we'll use Dave's remaining number of shirts to be washed, as we know that he had only washed 20 of the total shirts:

total number of shirts (after washing) - number of shirts washed = number of shirts Dave didn't wash
18 + 34 - 20 = number of shirts Dave didn't wash
52 - 20 = 32 (shirts Dave didn't wash)

So there were 32 shirts that Dave didn't wash.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pictures Haley took during her vacation and then subtract the number of pictures she deleted to find the number of pictures she still has.

Let's begin by finding how many pictures Haley took at the zoo and the museum. She took 50 pictures at the zoo and x pictures at the museum, where x represents the unknown quantity.

At the zoo: 50 pictures
At the museum: x pictures

Next, we know that she deleted 38 pictures from her total collection. In order to find which of these 38 pictures were taken at the zoo and which were taken at the museum, we need to understand which location she deleted pictures from. Unfortunately, the problem does not provide this information.

Let's assume that some of the pictures she deleted were from both the zoo and the museum. Let's further assume that she deleted a, b, and c pictures from the zoo, and d, e, and f pictures from the museum, where a, b, and c are unknown quantities, and d, e, and f are also unknown quantities.

Out of the 50 pictures she took at the zoo, she deleted a, b, and c pictures.

At the zoo: 50 - a pictures

Out of the x pictures she took at the museum, she deleted d, e, and f pictures.

At the museum: x - d pictures

Now, combine the pictures she still has from both locations.

Total pictures left after deletion: (50 - a) + (x - d)

Lastly, let's substitute the value of x from the first set of equations. Since we already know that she took 50 pictures at the zoo, and we want to solve for x, let's use the second set of equations which are the unknown number of pictures she took at the museum.

At the museum: x = 8 - (d + f)

Using this formula, substitute the value of x into the equation we used to find the total number of pictures remaining.

Total pictures left after deletion: (50 - a) + (8 - (d + f)) - d

Note that, when Haley deleted pictures, she may have deleted more pictures from the zoo than she did from the museum, and may have also deleted some pictures from both locations. To account for this, we need to subtract the number d from the expression for the museum, and from within the parentheses of ((8-d) - f) because d may be greater than or equal to f, and f is the remaining number of pictures taken at the museum after deleting d.

The final answer is: (50 - a) + (8 - (d + f)) - d pictures left.</s>",20

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation to represent the number of roses the florist has at each point. Let x represent the number of roses the florist had initially. When she sold 3 of them, she was left with x - 3 roses. We'll call this quantity y:

y = x - 3

Next, we calculate how many roses she has after picking up 34 more. Let z be this quantity:

z = y + 34

Substituting for y and simplifying, we get:

z = x - 3 + 34

z = x + 31

We can solve for x in terms of z:

x = z - 31

Now, we can find out how many roses the florist has at the end. Let w be this quantity:

w = z

Substituting for z and simplifying, we get:

w = x + 31

w = (z - 31) + 31

w = z

So we see that the number of roses she had at the end is the same as the number of roses she had at the end after picking up 34 more. Therefore, we can say that:

z = {The final answer is} w

In fact, since the equation z = w, they are equal, so:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's identify the unknown variables and known variables.

Unknown variables:
- The symbol “?” represents two unknown variables: the type of soda (regular or diet) for both regular and diet sodas.

Known variables:
- Cody is having a ! (surprise) birthday party.
- He bought a total of 44 sodas, with 4 being regular and the remaining being diet.
- His fridge can hold a maximum of 6 sodas on each shelf, regardless of whether they are regular or diet.

To find out how many regular and diet sodas Cody has, we need to find the number of regular sodas first. Since we don't know whether “?” represents a regular or diet soda, let's say it represents regular sodas. Substituting the known variables, we get:

4 ""?"" regular sodas + 44 diet sodas = 48 sodas (total number of sodas purchased)
4 x ""?"" = 48 - 44 (number of regular sodas)
4 ""?"" = 4
""?"" = 1 (the number of regular sodas can't be a decimal or a fraction)

Now that we've found the number of regular sodas, let's substitute ""?"" with 1 to understand how many shelves Cody will fill, up, due to space constraints.

Total number of sodas: 4 (regular) + 44 (diet) = 48
Number of shelves needed: Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
Number of shelves needed: 48 / 6 = 8  (integer part)
          ...      (remainder)

Since fractional shelves are not possible, Cody’s fridge can hold a maximum of 8 shelves filled with sodas, up.

The final answer is: Cody's fridge can fill up to 8 shelves with sodas, given his space constraints. 

Note: If we assume that ""?"" represented diet sodas instead of regular sodas, then the process would be the same except that the answer would be: Cody's fridge can fill up to 63 shelves with sodas, given his space constraints. (Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf). This is because, for this instance, we would have found:

- Number of diet sodas: 44 = ""?""
- Number of regular sodas: 4 = ""?"" (which was found to be 1 earlier)
- Total number of sodas: 4 (regular) + 44 (diet) = 48
- Number of shelves needed: Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
                                :  48 / 6 = 8 (integer part)
                                :  0 (remainder, since we took integer parts only)

In either case the maximum number of shelves that can be filled, up, is 8.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the information given to find the total number of debaters first, and then use that to find how many groups of 9 can be made.

Steps:
1. Find the total number of debaters:
   The schools ! debate team had 26 boys and 46 girls.
   To find the total number of debaters, we can add the number of boys and girls:
   26 boys and 46 girls on the debate team equals a total of 72 debaters (26 + 46 = 72).

2. Check if the statement is true:
   ! in this case represents a negation, so we need to find a way to represent this symbol in this context. Since we do not have enough information, let's assume it's just used as a variable here.

3. Find the number of groups that can be made:
   Each group has 9 debaters.
   Using the total number of debaters we found (72), we can calculate how many groups of 9 can be made:
   72 ÷ 9 = 8.
   This result means that 8 complete groups of 9 debaters can be formed.

Final answer:
If the schools ! debate team followed a statement of splitting into groups of 9, they would be able to make 8 complete groups of 9 debaters.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the number of red apples, green apples, and total apples ordered as variables. Let's call the number of red apples x, the number of green apples y, and the total number of apples z.

The school cafeteria ordered a total of 6 red apples (x), 15 green apples (y), and an unspecified number of total apples (z). Since we are given the number of red apples and green apples, we can set up a system of equations to find the value of z.

x = 6 (number of red apples)
y = 15 (number of green apples)
z = x + y (total number of apples)

Let's substitute the values of x and y into the equation for z and form the system:

6 = x
15 = y
z = x + y

To find the value of z, we can solve the system of equations using a method such as substitution or system of linear equations. Here, we'll use substitution.

Let's substitute x (from the first equation) into the equation for y:

y = 15 (number of green apples)

y = 15 (equivalent to setting x = 6 in our original system)

z = x + y

z = 6 + 15

z = 21

So the total number of apples ordered is 21.

Now let's move on to the second part of the question.

If only 5 students want fruit, then there must be more apples left over than just the number of apples eaten by the students who want fruit. We can calculate this difference by subtracting the number of apples eaten by the students who want fruit (5x + 5y) from the total number of apples ordered (z).

The remaining number of apples (r) is:

r = z - (5x + 5y)

Let's substitute our previous results for x, y, and z:

r = 21 - (5 * 6 + 5 * 15)

r = 21 - 45

r = -24

Since we can't have negative numbers of apples, our assumption that only 5 students wanted fruit must have been incorrect. It's possible that more students wanted fruit than the given number, or that there were other factors leading to excess apples, but we can't conclusively determine what happened from the given information.

{The final answer is that we can't determine how many extra apples were left over.}</s>",16

To solve this problem, we first need to identify the unknowns and knowns.

Unknowns:
- Time (?)
- Company (?)
- Picnic (?)
- Game (volleyball)
- Number of teams (8)

Knowns:
- Number of managers (?)
- Number of employees (15)
- Total number of people playing the game (9 + managers + employees)

Now, let's reason through each step to arrive at the final answer.

1. Find the total number of people playing the game.
   - Number of managers is unknown, but let's call it x.
   - Total number of people playing the game = 9 managers + 9 employees (since everyone is playing except for the manager observing the game) + x managers (since some managers might be playing too).
   - Total number of people playing the game = 9x + 18

2. Find the number of managers and employees playing the game.
   - Number of employees playing the game is 15, so the number of employees not playing the game is 15 - 15 = 0 (i.e., everyone is playing).
   - Number of managers playing the game is x (some managers might not be playing).
   - Number of people playing the game (from step 1): 9x + 18
   - Number of managers and employees playing the game: x + 15
   - Equating the number of people playing the game and managers and employees: 9x + 18 = x + 15

3. Find the number of people on each team.
   - Number of people on each team: Total number of people / Number of teams = (9x + 15x + 18) / 8
   - Simplifying the expression: (81x + 144) / 64

4. Arrange the answer in the form required by the question.
   - The final answer is: If 9 managers and 15 employees decide to start a volleyball game at an unknown time during an unknown company's unknown picnic and split into 8 teams, then each team will have approximately 10 people (i.e., (81x + 144) / 64 rounded to the nearest whole number).

Note: Since we don't know the values of x (number of managers playing), we can't determine the exact number of people on each team. However, we have an approximation because we don't know whether all the managers are playing or not. Nonetheless, we can solve similar problems with specific values of x to find the exact number of people on each team.</s>",3

Let's represent the number of books in the store, in the bin, and at the bargain bin initially as S, B, and BB, respectively. After selling 3 books, we have S - 3 books in the store and B - 3 books in the bin. Next, an additional 10 books, denoted as x, are put into the bargain bin, so the number of books in the bin becomes B - 3 + x. We want to find the value of x. Here's how we can solve this:

S - 3 = B - 3 + x   // Sell 3 books
B - 3 = BB + x    // Add 10 books to the bargain bin

We can simplify the first equation by eliminating B:

S - B = 3 + x
B - BB = x

Now, let's subtract the second equation from the first:

S - B - BB = 3
x = 3

So, after selling 3 books and putting 10 more in the bargain bin, there will be 3 books fewer than the initial number of books left in the store. Therefore, the number of books in the bargain bin would be the initial number of books in the bin, B, plus 10 books, or B + 10. Using the fact that B = S - 3, it follows that:

x = B + 10 - BB = S - 6 + 10 = S - 1

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can approach it in the following steps:

1. Find Mike's total earnings from mowing lawns over the summer: $42
2. Subtract the cost of the new mower blades from Mike's total earnings to get his total earnings after making this purchase: $42 - $10 = $32
3. Divide Mike's remaining earnings by the price of each game ($0.80) to find the number of games he can buy with the money he has left: $32 / $0.80 = 40 games
4. The final answer is: If Mike spent $10 on new mower blades and earned $42 from mowing lawns over the summer, he can buy 40 $0.80 games with the money he has left.
                       {The final answer is: Mike can buy 40 $0.80 games with the money he has left.}

Here's the breakdown of each step:

Step 1:
Mike made a total of $42 from mowing lawns over the summer.

Step 2:
When Mike purchased new mower blades for $10, his total earnings decreased by this amount. So, we can rewrite this step as follows:
Mike's total earnings - cost of new mower blades = How much Mike earned from mowing lawns after purchasing new mower blades
$42 - $10 = $32

Step 3:
To find how many games Mike can buy with the remaining earnings, we can divide his remaining earnings by the price of each game. This is equivalent to:
Number of games = How much Mike has left / Price of each game
At the end of step 2, we know Mike has $32 left from his total earnings.
In one game, Mike spends $0.80, so there are $0.20 left over from one game.
If there are x games Mike plans to buy, then in total, Mike will spend $0.80 times x games, as well as $0.20 from the leftover amount from each game.
The total amount that Mike plans to spend on games is:
$0.80 * x games + ($32 - ($0.80 * x games)) * $0.20 = How much Mike plans to spend on games
Simplifying this equation, we can see that it is equivalent to:
$0.80 * x games + $0.20 * (32 - $0.80 * x games) = How much Mike plans to spend on games
We can see that the expression inside the second set of parentheses is the difference between the original $32 remaining earnings, and the amount spent on games ($0.80 * x games).
Now, we can use algebra to solve for x (the number of games Mike can buy):
$x * $0.80 + $0.20 * (32 - $0.80 * x) = How much Mike plans to spend on games
$x * $0.80 = How much Mike plans to spend on games - $0.20 * (32 - $0.80 * x)
Using properties of equality, we can rearrange the expression to solve for x:
$x = \dfrac{How much Mike plans to spend on games - $0.20 * (32 - $0.80 * x)}{$0.80}
Remember, $x$ represents the number of games Mike can buy, and $How much Mike plans to spend on games$ is the remaining earnings Mike has, less the cost of the games he's planning to buy.
At this point, we can substitute the known values back into the expression to get:
$x = \dfrac{How much Mike plans to spend on games - $0.20 * (32 - $0.80 * x)}{$0.80}$

This is the formula we need to solve for $x$. Note that at this point, we do not know the exact value for $How much Mike plans to spend on games$, so this equation represents an algebraic formula that can predict the number of games Mike can buy given a value for how much he plans to spend on them. In step 4, we will solve this formula to find the exact number of games Mike can buy with his remaining earnings, given the values we have been provided with.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. We are given that the chef needs to cook 13 potatoes and has already cooked 5. The remaining number of potatoes that need to be cooked is 13 - 5, which is 8.

2. Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook. So, the time it takes to cook one potato is represented by x = 6.

3. Let's represent the total time taken by the chef to cook all 13 potatoes by y.

4. We also know that the chef has already cooked 5 potatoes, and we call the time taken to cook those by z.

5. We now have three equations to work out:

a. For the 5 potatoes that the chef has cooked: z = 5x
b. For the remaining 8 potatoes: 8x = y - z
c. We know that x = 6 minutes

6. Plugging the known values into our equations, we get:

a. Z = 5x
b. 8x = y - z
   (Here, the time taken to cook the 8 remaining potatoes is represented by y - z since the chef has already cooked 5 of them for z amount of time.)
c. X = 6

7. Let's simplify the second equation:

b. 8(6) = y - z
    y = 48 + z

8. We can't solve for y because z is unknown. We now have a system of two equations with two unknowns. Let's try to eliminate z to solve for y.

9. Taking z from the first equation (a) and substituting it into the second equation (b), we get:

z = 5x

48 + z = y

5x = 48

y = 54

10. Since we already know that x = 6, we can substitute this into the equation we got for y:

y = 54

5(6) = 54

We can see that our answer for y (the total time taken to cook all 13 potatoes) is 3 hours, or the equivalent of 180 minutes (since 1 minute = 60 seconds). {The final answer is 180 minutes}.

Final Answer: The chef will take 180 minutes (3 hours) to cook the remaining 8 potatoes and the 5 he has already cooked, in total.</s>",48

<|assistant|>
To find the number of math problems Paige had left to do for homework, we can subtract the number of math problems she finished at school from the total number of math problems she had:

Number of math problems left to do for homework = Total number of math problems - Number of math problems finished at school

Let's find the total number of math problems Paige had:

Total number of math problems = Number of math problems at the beginning of the day - Number of math problems finished at school

The number of math problems Paige had at the beginning of the day is 43. So, we can write this as:

Total number of math problems = 43 - Number of math problems finished at school (let's call this x)

Using this formula, let's find the number of math problems finished at school:

Number of math problems finished at school = Number of math problems at the beginning of the day - Total number of math problems (let's call this y)

From the given information, we know that number of math problems finished at school is 44. So, we can write this as:

44 = 43 - y

Let's solve for y:

y = 43 - 44 (using the formula 44 = 43 - y)

y = -1 (which is an invalid value as we can't have a negative number of problems)

So, the initial given information contradicts itself, as there's no possible number of math problems left if she finished all 44 math problems at school. Therefore, the given information is incorrect, and we cannot find a valid answer to this problem.

Now let's find the number of science problems Paige had at the end of the day, by subtracting the number of science problems she finished from the total number of science problems:

Number of science problems left for homework = Total number of science problems - Number of science problems finished

Let's find the total number of science problems she had:

Total number of science problems = Number of science problems at the beginning of the day - Number of science problems finished

Paige had 12 science problems at the beginning of the day. So, let's write:

Total number of science problems = 12 - Number of science problems finished (let's call this z)

The number of science problems she finished is not given, so we're not sure how many science problems she finished at school. Let's call her finished science problems x. We're looking to find the number left for homework, so how many did she finish at school doesn't matter.

Let's see how many science problems she finished in total -  both at school and at home.:

Number of science problems finished in total = Number of science problems finished at school + Number of science problems finished at home

Let's find the number of science problems finished at home:

Number of science problems finished at home = Number of science problems finished in total - Number of science problems finished at school

She finished a total of 43 math problems and 12 science problems, so let's find the total number of problems she finished:

Total number of problems finished = Number of math problems finished + Number of science problems finished

Let's find the number of math problems finished:

Number of math problems finished = Total number of problems finished - Number of science problems finished

Now here's where Paige finished all her math problems and science problems, so we can treat these as if they were done at school:

Number of science problems left for homework = 12 - (Number of science problems finished at school + Number of science problems finished at home)

Number of math problems left for homework = 43 - (Number of math problems finished at school + Number of math problems finished at home)

Let's add both left for homework as a set:

Combined number of problems left for homework = Number of science problems left for homework + Number of math problems left for homework

Let's find the combined total:

Combined total = Total number of science problems - Number of science problems finished + Total number of math problems - Number of math problems finished

Total number of science problems finished = Number of science problems finished at school + Number of science problems finished at home

Total number of math problems finished = Number of math problems finished at school + Number of math problems finished at home

Let's collect similar variables:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the variables and their meanings:
   - ? stands for a discount, which will be applied to the price of each flower.
   - a represents the type of flower. We have two types - roses and daisies.
   - sale indicates that there is a sale going on.
   - Each flower costs $8 without the discount.
   - Vanessa bought 3 roses and ! (1 in this case) 3 daisies.

2. Calculate the cost of the roses:
   - The cost of each rose is (8 - ?) dollars.
   - Vanessa bought 3 roses, so the cost of the roses is (3 roses) * (8 - ?) = 24 - 3? dollars.

3. Calculate the cost of the daisies:
   - Each daisy costs $8, so the cost of 3 daisies is $24 dollars.

4. Add up the costs of the roses and daisies:
   - The total cost of Vanessa's flower purchase is the sum of the costs of the roses and daisies.
   - Therefore, the total cost is 24 - 3? dollars for the roses plus $24 dollars for the daisies.
   - Math formula: $total cost = 24 - 3? + 24 = 48 - 3? $

5. Find the value of ?:
   - We know that the discount applied to each flower is ? dollars, and we also know the total cost of all the flowers.
   - Substituting these into the equation for total cost, we have:
   - $48 - 3? = (3 roses) * (8 - ?) + ! (3 daisies) * 8
   - Expanding the expression inside the parentheses, we get:
   - $48 - 3? = 24 - 9? + 24 - ! * 3?
   - Simplifying, we have:
   - $72 = 54 - 6?
   - Solving for ?, we get:
   - ? = 12 dollars.

6. Calculate the discount percentage:
   - The discount is ? dollars, so the discount percentage is:
   - Discount percentage = ($discount in dollars) * 100% / ($price before discount in dollars) = (12) * 100% / 48 dollars = 25%.

7. End with a conclusion:
   - Therefore, the flowers were having a 25% discount sale, and Vanessa's total cost was $48 dollars for 6 flowers - $12 dollars in discounts, for a final cost of $36 dollars after discounts. {The final answer is $36 dollars.}</s>",48

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To figure out how many pictures were in each album, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Olivia uploaded a total of 40 pictures (5 from her phone and 35 from her camera) to Facebook. We'll call this the total number of pictures, and we'll represent it by the variable T.

   T = 5 + 35 = 40

2. We also know that Olivia sorted the pictures into 8 different albums. Each album contains the same number of pictures. We'll represent the number of pictures in each album by the variable P.

3. We want to find out how many pictures were in each album, so let's think about how many pictures Olivia would have uploaded to each album. Since each album contains the same number of pictures, that number is simply P.

   Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone, so each album would contain 5/8 of a picture from her phone and 35/8 of a picture from her camera. In other words, for each album,

  Number of pictures from Olivia's phone = 5/8 * P

  Number of pictures from Olivia's camera = 35/8 * P

4. To find the total number of pictures in each album, we need to add the number of pictures from Olivia's phone and the number of pictures from Olivia's camera. This gives us the total number of pictures in each album (represented by the variable E).

  E = 5/8 * P + 35/8 * P

   E = (5 + 35)/8 * P

   E = 40/8 * P

   E = 5 * P

   But we already know that each album contains P pictures. So let's replace P with E/5.

   E = 5 * (E/5)

   Simplifying this expression, we get E = E. This doesn't make sense, since we want a unique value for E that represents the number of pictures in each album.

5. The issue with the last step is that our assumption doesn't work. Each album cannot contain the same number of pictures as the total number of pictures uploaded. This means that there must be some variation in the number of pictures in each album, even if they're all the same size. So instead, we'll assume that the number of pictures in each album is simply X, where X is some integer between 1 and T, inclusive.

6. Let's revise our expression to fit our new assumption. If each album contains X pictures, then Olivia would need to upload X/8 pictures from her phone and X/8 pictures from her camera to each album (using the same reasoning as before). Once again, we want to find the total number of pictures uploaded to each album (E).

   E = (X/8) + (X/8) * 35

   Simplifying this expression, we get E = X.

7. To complete the problem, we'll substitute our expression for E into our original assumption for the total number of uploaded pictures (T). We get:

   T = (X/8) * 8 + (X/8) * 8 * 35

8. Now, if we simplify this expression:

   T = X * 40/8

   Simplifying this expression, we get T = 5 * X.

9. We know that Olivia uploaded a total of 40 pictures, so we can replace T with 40 to find a new expression for X in terms of E.

   E = X

   Substituting E for X, we get:

   E = E

   Simplifying this expression, we get E = E. However, this expression is simply our original assumption. Since we want a unique value for E that represents the number of pictures in each album, this assumption doesn't work.

10. So instead, let's replace E with X to find a new expression for X.

   X = (X/8) * 8 + (X/8) * 8 * 35

11. Now, let's simplify this expression.

   X = X * 40/8

   Simplifying this expression, we get X = 5 * X",5

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's call the number of oatmeal cookies Robin has x. We want to find how many baggies Robin can make. First, let's find out how many cookies she has in total.

Total number of cookies = 23 chocolate chip + x oatmeal

To find out how many baggies Robin can make with oatmeal cookies, we divide the number of cookies by the number of cookies in each bag.

Number of bags with oatmeal cookies = x / (6 : oatmeal)

We know that there are 6 chocolate chip cookies in each bag. To find out how many baggies Robin can make with chocolate chip cookies, we divide the number of cookies by 6.

Number of bags with chocolate chip cookies = 23 / 6

Now we want to find out how many baggies Robin can make in total. We add the number of baggies with oatmeal cookies and the number of baggies with chocolate chip cookies.

Total number of baggies = (x / (6 : oatmeal)) + (23 / 6)

To make it easier to calculate, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses by finding the value of (6 : oatmeal) for Robin's cookies.

(6 : oatmeal) = 25 : oatmeal

(6 : oatmeal) = 25 / 6 oatmeal cookies per bag

Substituting this value into the expression for finding the total number of baggies, we get:

Total number of baggies = (x * 1) + (23 * 4)

Note that the number of cookies in each bag for oatmeal is 1 oatmeal cookie, because we found the ratio (6 : oatmeal) for Robin's cookies is equivalent to 25 : oatmeal.

Substituting x with the expression: Total number of oatmeal cookies - 23 (the number of chocolate chip cookies) we get:

Total number of baggies = ((Total number of oatmeal cookies - 23) * 1) + (23 * 4)

Simplifying this expression, we find the total number of baggies:

Total number of baggies = (Total number of oatmeal cookies - 23) * 5

The expression for the total number of baggies now includes only one variable, which is the total number of oatmeal cookies that Robin has. 

To find out the total number of oatmeal cookies, we add the number of chocolate chip cookies and the number of oatmeal cookies Robin has:

Total number of oatmeal cookies + Total number of chocolate chip cookies = Total number of cookies

Substituting 23 for the number of chocolate chip cookies, we get:

Total number of oatmeal cookies + 23 = Total number of cookies

Simplifying this expression, we find the total number of oatmeal cookies:

Total number of oatmeal cookies = Total number of cookies - 23

Now that we found the total number of oatmeal cookies, we can use this value to calculate the total number of baggies she can make. The expression for calculating the total number of baggies now includes only the total number of oatmeal cookies that Robin has.

Total number of baggies = (Total number of oatmeal cookies - 23) * 5

The final answer is:

{The final answer is: The total number of baggies Robin can make is (Total number of oatmeal cookies - 23) * 5}

Alternatively, if we don't want to find the total number of oatmeal cookies Robin has, we can calculate the total number of baggies using the expression we found for the total number of baggies:

Total number of baggies = ((Total number of oatmeal cookies - 23) * 1) + (23 * 4)

Substituting x with the expression: Total number of oatmeal cookies - 23 (the number of chocolate chip cookies) we get:

Total number of baggies = ((Total number of oatmeal cookies - ",8

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Let's identify the variables.

   - C: the number of dollars Cody had before his birthday (45)
   - B: the number of dollars Cody received for his birthday (unspecified)
   - G: the number of dollars Cody spent on the new game (19)
   - ?: the missing value we're trying to find

2. Write out the information we know in a series of statements.

   - Cody had 45 dollars before his birthday. (C = 45)
   - Cody received B dollars for his birthday, so his total after receiving the gift was B more than before. (C + B = Cody's total after gift)
   - Cody spent 19 dollars on a new game (G = 19)

3. Using the second statement, we can find Cody's total (T) immediately following his birthday purchase:

   - T = C + B

4. Now we can use the third statement to find how much Cody spent on the game out of his total following his birthday purchase:

   - G = T * (spending on ?) / 100
   - (19 = T * (spending on ?) / 100)

5. Solve for the missing variable, (spending on ?):

   - (spending on ?) = 100 * G / T

6. Now let's find Cody's current total:

   - C = T - G (the money spent on the game)

7. Plug in our known variables to find Cody's current total:

   - C = T - G
   - (C = T - 19 * (spending on ?) / T)

8. Substitute our expression from step 5 into step 7:

   - C = T - 19 * (100 * G / T) / 100
   - (C = T - G)

9. Simplify our expression from step 8:

   - C = T - G = B

10. Finally, we can find Cody's current total using what we know:

   - Final Answer: Cody has (T) dollars now. (T = C + B)

So we can see that the expression for Cody's current total (T) in terms of C, B, and G is:

   - T = C + B - G

Where

  - C = 45 (Cody's cash before his birthday)
  - B = ? (the number of dollars Cody received for his birthday)
  - G = 19 (the number of dollars Cody spent on the new game)

The missing value B can be determined using the first two statements, which have already been presented.

<|assistant|>
Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. First, we know that a total of 24 pictures (22 from the phone and 2 from the camera) were uploaded to Facebook. Let's call this number x.
 
2. Next, we're told that the pictures were sorted into 4 different albums with the same number of pictures in each album. Let's call this number y.
 
3. Now, we can find the number of pictures in each album by dividing the total number of pictures uploaded (x) by the number of albums (4). Each album should contain an integer number of pictures, so we round up to make sure each album gets at least one picture.
 
4. To find the number of pictures in each album, we use the following formula:
   
   x / 4 = y (rounded up)
 
5. Let's solve this equation:
  
   x = 4 * y (rounded up)
  
   x = 4y + 4 (rounded up)
  
6. Now, let's substitute the value of y in terms of x into the equation from step 4:
 
   x / 4 = (x - 4) / 4 + 1 (rounded up)
 
7. We know that we always round up the result of dividing x by 4, because that way each album gets at least one picture. So we add 1 to the result of dividing x by 4.
 
8. Simplifying the expression above, we get:
 
   x / 4 = (x - 4) / 4 + 1
 
9. To simplify further, we subtract 1 from both sides:
 
   x / 4 = (x - 4) / 4
 
10. We can also add 4 to both sides:
 
   x = 4 + (x - 4) / 4 * 4
 
11. Finally, let's solve for x:
 
   x = 4 + 4 * (x - 4) / 4
  
   x = 4 + x - 4
  
12. Solving for x, we find:
 
   x = 4
  
13. This means that each album contains 4 pictures, and since we're rounding up the division, we get 5 pictures in each album. Therefore, we've confirmed that there are 4 albums, and each album contains 5 pictures, which matches the requirements given in the original problem statement.
 
Therefore, the final answer is:

In each of the 4 ! albums, Wendy has sorted 5 pictures. {The final answer is: In each of the 4 ! albums, Wendy has sorted 5 pictures.}</s>",6

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps and reasoning.

1. Let's first calculate the total number of candies they received. Katie had 8! (8 factorial) pieces, which is a large number. Since we're not given any more context, let's assume that Katie received some regular candies and some with exclamation points (!). Therefore, her number of candies is too large to add up. However, we know that her sister had fewer candies, 23 in total. Adding their totals, we get 23 plus Katie's 8! as the total number of candies they combined.

2. Now we can start thinking about how many candies they both ate on the first night. Here, we're told that Katie and her sister ate a total of 8 pieces together. Katie's share is unknown, but we do know that her sister ate some candies too, so the total number of candies they ate on the first night is less than the total number of candies they started with.

3. At this point, we can create a system of equations to represent what we know. We know the total number of candies, the number of candies eaten on the first night, and the number of candies each sister has left at the end. Let x represent the number of candies Katie has left, and y represent the number of candies her sister has left.

   a) total number of candies = candies Katie and her sister started with
   
   b) candies eaten on the first night = Katie's share + her sister's share
   
   c) candies left over for Katie and her sister = total number of candies - candies eaten on the first night
  
4. Combine Equations (a), (b), and (c) to get the system:

   x + y = 23 (Equation 1)

   x + y/3 = 8 (Equation 2)

   Here, we're using the fact that each sister ate a third of the total number of candies they ate on the first night.

5. Next, we'll solve for x in Equation (2). Remember, we don't yet know the value for y, so let's substitute all known values into Equation (2) with x as the variable we're trying to find:

   x + (23 - x)/3 = 8

   Distributing the parentheses, we get:

   x + 7 - x/3 = 8

   Grouping like terms and simplifying, we get:

   -x/3 = -35

   Multiplying both sides by -3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

   x = 105

6. Now that we know the value of x, we can substitute it back into Equation (1) to find the value of y:

   x + y = 23

   Substituting our solution for x from Step 5, we get:

   105 + y = 23

   Subtracting 105 from both sides, we get:

   y = -82

   Since negative numbers don't make sense in this context, it's unlikely that the sisters consumed more than all the candies they received. Therefore, we conclude that no possible set of values for candy consumption meets all the given criteria.

   Therefore, we can say, {The final answer is Unfortunately, it seems that there is no possible solution to this problem, given the information provided}.</s>",23

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Let's find out how many puppies were sold in one day.
- The store had 88 puppies in total.
- 34 puppies were sold in one day.
- Therefore, the number of puppies left (remaining) is 88 - 34, which is 54 puppies.

2. Let's find out how many cages are needed to put these puppies in rest (cages) cages.
- Each cage can hold 6 puppies.
- The number of puppies in rest cages is 54 (from step 1).
- Let's create an expression to find the number of cages required.
- Number of cages = Total number of puppies in rest cages / Number of puppies in each rest cage (6).
- Number of cages = 54 / 6.
- The number of rest cages is 9 (rounded to the nearest integer).

3. Let's calculate the total number of cages used (including those used for newly sold puppies).
- Number of cages used = Number of puppies sold (from step 1) / Number of puppies in each newly sold cage (6) + Number of rest cages (from step 2).
- Number of cages used = 34 / 6 + 9.
- The total number of cages used is 13 (rounded to the nearest integer).

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps.

First, let's calculate the number of trays Jerry needs to pick up from Table 1:
9 trays from Table 1 = 9 trays

Next, we can determine the number of trays Jerry needs to pick up from Table 2:
7 trays from Table 2 = 7 trays

Now that we know the number of trays Jerry needs to pick up from each table, we can find out how many trips he needs to make in total.

Since Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, we'll calculate the number of trips he needs to make for each table separately:

Number of trips at Table 1 = Number of trays at Table 1 divided by the number of trays Jerry can carry (8):
Number of trips at Table 1 = 9 trays ÷ 8 trays per trip = 1 entire trip with 8 trays, plus 1 trip with 1 tray
Number of trips at Table 1 = 2 trips

Number of trips at Table 2 = Number of trays at Table 2 divided by the number of trays Jerry can carry (8):
Number of trips at Table 2 = 7 trays ÷ 8 trays per trip = 1 entire trip with 8 trays, plus 0 trips with remaining trays
Number of trips at Table 2 = 1 trip

Adding these two values together will tell us how many trips Jerry needs to make in total:

Total number of trips = Number of trips at Table 1 plus number of trips at Table 2:
Total number of trips = 2 trips from Table 1 plus 1 trip from Table 2
Total number of trips = 3 trips

So, Jerry will need to make a total of 3 trips to pick up all the trays.

In summary, Jerry will make 2 trips to pick up all the trays from Table 1 and 1 trip to pick up all the trays from Table 2, for a total of 3 trips. {The final answer is 3 trips}.</s>",2

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the value of one point scored in the video game. Since Faye scores 7 points for each treasure found, the value of one point is equivalent to finding one treasure (1 point = 1 treasure).

2. Find the total number of treasures found on the first level. Faye found 2! treasures on the first level, where ! denotes a factorial. This means she found two treasures, and one of them must have been particularly special to warrant an exclamation mark. In other words, she found one ordinary treasure and one special treasure on the first level.

3. Determine the score Faye obtained on the first level. Since Faye found 2! treasures on the first level and scores 7 points for each treasure found, her score on the first level can be found by multiplying the number of ordinary treasures found (one) with the number of points scored for finding one ordinary treasure (7), and then doing the same for the special treasure found (1!) to give us an expression for the score so far: score_1 = 7 + 14 = 21 points.

4. Find the total number of treasures found on the second level. Faye found 6! treasures on the second level. We also know from the text that one of these must have been particularly special since Faye used an exclamation mark to make us aware of its specialness. However, since we are not given an indication of how many special treasures were found, it's unknown whether all six were special, or just one or some combination of special treasures. We cannot simply assume that all six were special treasures, since doing so would lead to an unrealistic score of over 6,000 points!

5. Determine Faye's score on the second level. Until we know how many special treasures Faye found, we cannot accurately determine the value of one point on the second level. In order to continue solving this problem, we will assume that all 6! treasures were ordinary, since we haven't been given any additional information to support a different conclusion. Thus, we can find fayes_score_2 as follows: score_2 = 7 * 6 + 7 * (6-1) = 42 points if all were ordinary, or 0 if she found no further special treasures.

6. Determine Faye's total score. We find Faye's total score by adding the scores from both levels: total_score = faye_score_1 + faye_score_2 = 21 + 42 = 63 points at least as far as we can determine, until we find out how many special treasures are found on the second level. We'll hold off calculating the answer since we don't know all the information yet.

{The final answer is} 63 points (based on the assumption that Faye found no further special treasures on the second level) or we don't know the final answer (if we assume that all the 6! treasures were special).</s>",56

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Megan picked 19 carrots from her garden, so we have 19 as the initial number of carrots. {The initial number of carrots is 19}.

2. Megan threw out 4 of the carrots. We can represent this with the formula 19 - 4 = x, where x is the number of carrots remaining after she threw some away.

3. We don't know how many carrots Megan picked the next day, but we do know that she picked 46 more. Let's call the number of carrots she picked the second day b (for ""the next?"").

4. Combining the remaining carrots from day 1 and the carrots picked on day 2 gives us the total number of carrots Megan has. This can be written as x + b = total (where total is the number of carrots Megan has in total).

5. Using the information we know, we can rearrange the equations to calculate the value of the unknowns. For example:

- In equation 2, we know that x is the number of carrots Megan has after she threw some away. We don't know what this is, but we know that it's fewer than 19 because of the throwing out.

- In equation 3, we know that b is the number of carrots Megan picked on day 2. We also know that it's greater than, or equal to, 0 because we can't pick fewer than 0 carrots.

Putting these together, we have:

- 19 carrots initially
- 4 thrown away, leaving x carrots
- b carrots picked on the next day
- Total number of carrots is x + b

6. To find the total number of carrots Megan has, we can add the values from equation 4 to get:

total = x + b

substituting in our expressions:

total = 19 - 4 + b

simplifying:

total = 15 + b

{The total number of carrots Megan has is 15 plus the number of carrots she picked on the next day}.</s>",61

2. She deleted 37 files, which means that she is now left with 45 files. (initial number of files - number of deleted files)

82 - 37 = 45

3. Wendy put the remaining 45 files into folders, with each folder containing 5 files. (number of remaining files divided by number of files in each folder)

45 ÷ 5 = 9

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to determine the total number of players on the baseball team. There are 12 new players and 44 returning players, so the total number of players is 12 + 44 = 56. (The new players and returning players are combined, since they will all be playing together as one team.)

2. Next, we know that the coach divided the players into ? groups with 8 players in each group. Since the number of players is a multiple of 8 (56 = 7 * 8), we can divide this number evenly into groups of 8. (We could also use long division to find the quotient and remainder, but since the number of players is a multiple of 8, we don't need to do that here.)

3. The formula for finding the number of groups when dividing an even number of items into equal-sized groups is:

    Number of items / Number of items per group = Number of groups

    Substituting in the known values from Step 1, we get:

    56 / 8 = Number of groups

4. Simplifying this expression, we have:

    7 * 8 = 56

    7 = Number of groups

5. Finally, we can state the answer, including the {The final answer is} phrase:

    {The final answer is} 7, which is how many ? groups the coach would need to put together the baseball team with 8 players in each group.</s>",7

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to identify what variables are given and what we are trying to find. 

Let's start by identifying the known variables:

- Made $104 mowing lawns over the summer. (Let's call this x.)
- Spent $41 on new mower blades. (Let's call this y.)

Our goal is to find out how many 9-dollar games Made can buy with the money he has left after buying mower blades. Let's call this unknown number z.

To find out how many games Made can buy with the remaining money, we first calculate how much money Made has left after buying the mower blades:

x - y = z

Here's how we interpret this equation: Made's total earnings from mowing lawns (x) minus what he spent on mower blades (y) equals how many 9-dollar games he can buy with the remaining money (z).

Now, let's replace the variables in this equation with their actual values:

104 - 41 = z

We can isolate the variable z by subtracting 41 from both sides of the equation:

104 - 41 - 41 = z - 41

Now, we simplify by adding 41 to both sides:

63 = z

This means that after buying the mower blades, Made would have $63 left to spend on games. 

To find out how many games Made can buy with his remaining money, we divide the remaining money (63) by the cost of each game (9):

63 ÷ 9 = z

Let's round z to the nearest integer:

7 games = z

So, Made can buy 7 games with his remaining money. Here's our final answer:

{The final answer is: Made can buy 7 games with the remaining money he has after buying the new mower blades.}</s>",7

Using substitution, we can replace x with (12 - ?) to get a new equation where we can solve for ?:

x + 21 = 12 - ? + 21
x = 12 - ?

3. Roger spent 25 dollars on a new game. (...for his birthday, he got 28 dollars more but spent 25 dollars...)
4. To find the amount of money Roger has now, we can find the total amount he has after receiving the 28 dollars and spending 25 dollars on the game.

To solve this problem, let's first identify the number of problems on each worksheet. Since the worksheet had 4 problems, let's call this x.

Next, we know that a total of 4 problems were on each of the worksheets, so if we have the number of worksheets (16) and the number of problems already graded (8), we can set up a system of equations to find the remaining number of problems that need to be graded.

Let's write our system of equations:

x * 16 = total number of problems
x * 8 = number of problems already graded

We can translate this into an equation form:

16x = 8x + 64

Next, let's isolate our variable 'x' from the equation. To do this, we need to find a way to get 'x' on its own:

16x - 8x = 64
8x = 64
x = 8

So, our value for 'x' is 8, which means there are 8 problems on each worksheet.

Now that we have the value for 'x', let's find the number of problems that still need to be graded. Here's how:

Total cooking time = 6 minutes already cooked + 3.6 minutes for the remaining 6 potatoes + x minutes for the remaining potatoes

So our equation is:

6 + 3.6 + x = Total cooking time (let's say this is 'TC')

We can substitute this TC into our known values to get x:

TC = 6 (already cooked) + 3.6 (remaining) + x (remaining)

TC = 9.6 + x

TC - 9.6 = x

When we subtract 9.6 from both sides, we're left with x in terms of TC, which makes it easier to solve for when we're given the total cooking time:

x = TC - 9.6

So for example, if the chef wanted to cook all the potatoes in 20 minutes, we could find out how long it would take to cook the remaining potatoes:

20 = 9.6 + x

20 - 9.6 = x

x = 10.4 minutes

So it would take the chef an additional 10.4 minutes to cook the remaining 6 potatoes. {The final answer is 10.4 minutes}.</s>",36

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps and reason through each one:

1. Let's assign variables to make the calculation easier:
    - x = the number of old games Luke originally had (57)
    - y = the number of old games Luke sold (39)
    - b = the number of boxes Luke used to pack up the remaining games (unknown)
    - g = the number of games in each box (unknown)
2. After selling y old games, Luke has x-y games left:
    - x - y = r (r is the remaining number of old games)
3. Luke packed the remaining games into b boxes:
    - b represents the number of boxes Luke used to pack up the remaining games.
4. Let's find the number of games in each box:
    - To find the number of games in each box, we divide the remaining number of games by the number of boxes:
        - r / b = g (g represents the number of games in each box)
5. Let's find the total number of games Luke originally had:
    - We know that Luke originally had x old games. That's the total number of games he had before selling any.
6. Let's find the total number of games Luke sold:
    - We know that Luke sold y old games.
7. Let's find the total number of games left after Luke sold his old games and packed up the remaining ones:
    - We know that Luke originally had x old games, sold y, and packed up r. The total number of games left is the sum of the remaining games and the number of games in the boxes Luke used:
        - r + (g * b) = z (z represents the total number of games Luke has left)
8. Let's find the total number of boxes Luke used:
    - We know that Luke packed the remaining games into b boxes. This is the number of boxes we're looking for.

With these steps and variables, we can now represent the entire problem with equations and solve for the unknown values. This will help us reach the final answer:

- x - y = r
- r / b = g
- z = r + (g * b)
- b = {The final answer is}

Here's how you can apply these variables and equations to solve the problem:

1. Start by writing down the problem and identifying the variables:

    Luke had 57 old games and sold 39 of them. He packed the rest up in boxes, each containing 2 old games. How many boxes did he use?

    - Let x = the original number of old games Luke had
    - Let y = the number of old games Luke sold
    - Let r = the number of old games Luke has left
    - Let b = the number of boxes Luke used
    - Let g = the number of old games in each box
    - Let z = the total number of old games Luke has left
2. Write down the equations relating the variables:

    - x - y = r   (equations for finding r)
    - r / b = g    (equations for finding g)
    - z = r + (g * b)   (equations for finding z)
3. Calculate r:

    - Substitute y, from the original problem, into the first equation:
        - x - 39 = r
    - Solve for r:
        - x - 39 = r
        - Subtract x from both sides:
            - -39 = r - x
        - Add x to both sides:
            - -39 + x = r
        - Rewrite the equation to show r:
            - r = -39 + x
4. Calculate g:

    - Substitute r, from step 3, and b into the second equation:
        - r / b = g
    - Solve for g:
        - -39 + x / b = g
        - Multiply both sides by b:
            - -39b +xb = bg
        - Isolate g:
            - g = xb / (b - 39)

5. Calculate z:

    - Combine r and g:
        - r + (g * b) = z
    - Substitute r and g from steps 3 and 4:

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the price per flower for each type of flower.
   - Roses are . (Unspecified) . We'll assume they're priced at $3 per flower, since that's the discount price for all flowers during the sale.
   - Daisies are also . (Unspecified) . We'll also assume they're priced at $3 per flower during the sale.

2. Calculate the price of each type of flower that Emily bought.
   - The number of roses is not given, so we'll represent it with an unknown variable, x. Each rose costs $3, so:
     - Roses: $3 \times x = x$ dollars.
   - Emily bought 2 daisies. Each daisy costs $3 during the sale, so:
     - Daisies: $3 \times 2 = 6$ dollars.

3. Add up the prices of the flowers to get Emily's total cost.
   - Total cost: x dollars for roses + 6 dollars for daisies = x + 6 dollars.

4. Express the result clearly, indicating the final answer.
   - The final answer is: $${x + 6}$$ dollars.

So if Emily bought x roses and 2 daisies, and each flower was discounted to $3 during the sale, she spent a total of ${x + 6}$ dollars.

We're not given a value for x, so we can't find out exactly how much Emily spent. But if we knew how many roses she bought, we could calculate her total cost precisely.</s>",12

                    ?  A pet store had 13 , puppies. In one day they sold 7 , of them : and put the rest ? into cages ? with 2 ? in : each cage. How : many cages did they use? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. First, let's find the number of puppies left after selling 7 of them.

   Initially, the pet store had 13 puppies. After selling 7, the number of puppies left is:

   13 - 7 = 6 puppies

   The remaining puppies are waiting to be put into cages.

2. Next, let's find the number of puppies in each cage after putting them into cages.

   Let's say x is the number of puppies in each cage. Since there are 6 puppies left, we can write:

   6 = x * c (number of cages)

   Solving this equation for c, we get:

   c = 6 / x

3. Now let's find the total number of puppies in the cages.

   Since there are c cages with x puppies each, the total number of puppies in cages is:

   x * c = x * (6 / x) = 6

   This is the same as the total number of puppies left after selling 7 of them, so the number of puppies in the cages (x) is:

   x = 6 / c

4. Let's also find the total number of cages used.

   We know that we have c cages with x puppies each. In addition, there are 7 puppies that were already sold, which means a total of 7 + cx puppies have been put into cages. Since initially the pet store had 13 puppies, we can write:

   13 = 7 + cx

   Solving this equation for c, we get:

   c = (13 - 7) / x

   Let's plug this into our formula for the number of puppies in each cage (x) to eliminate x:

   x = 6 / (13 - 7) / ((13 - 7) / x) = 6 / (13 - 7) * x

   Substituting this into our formula for the number of cages used, we get:

   c = ((13 - 7) / x - 7) / ((13 - 7) / x)

   Simplifying this expression, we get:

   c = (13 - 14) / ((13 - 7) / x)

   Since there can't be negative numbers of cages, we can't have more puppies in the cages than the ones left after selling 7, so we must have:

   x <= 6

   So, let's assume that x is the smallest possible positive value, which means 1 puppy per cage. Plugging this into our formula for the number of cages used, we get:

   c = (13 - 14 - 7) / (13 - 7 - 2)

   Simplifying this expression, we get:

   c = 0

   This means the pet store didn't put any puppies into cages, which is contradictory to the statement ""they put the rest ? into cages ? with 2 ? in : each cage."" Therefore, there's no solution in this case.

5. Let's reconsider the formula for the number of puppies in each cage (x). Since the smallest non-negative value for x is 1, let's assume x = 1, and then we'll increase its value.

6. Let's find the total number of puppies in the cages.

   With x = 1, the total number of puppies in cages is still 6 puppies.

7. Let's find the number of cages that were filled with 1 puppies each.

   Since each cage has 1 puppy, and there are 6 puppies total, we can write:

   c = 6

   The pet store didn't sell the puppies that were already put into cages, so they have:

   13 - 7 = 6 puppies left after selling 7 puppies, and a total of 6 puppies put into cages with 1 puppy each. So, the number of cages used is exactly the same",3

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first identify the unknown variables. Let's call the number of carrots in Faye's garden ""x."" The number of carrots Faye picked is ""x - 23,"" as we know she picked 23. Similarly, the number of carrots Faye's mother picked is ""x - 5,"" as we know she picked 5. Of these good carrots, only 12 were good, so there must be some bad ones. Let's call the number of bad carrots ""b."" 

We can write this in an equation:

x - 23 = 12 (good carrots picked by Faye)

x - 5 = 12 (good carrots picked by Faye's mother)

To find the bAD carrots, let's subtract the good carrots from the total number picked by the girls. Then, subtract the remaining good carrots from the total number of carrots to find the bad carrots.

Number of bad carrots picked by Faye = (x - 23) - (12 of the x - 23 carrots)

Number of bad carrots picked by Faye's mother = (x - 5) - (12 of the x - 5 carrots)

Let's simplify these expressions:

Number of bad carrots picked by Faye = (x - 23) - 12

Number of bad carrots picked by Faye's mother = (x - 5) - 12

We've found an expression for each girl's bad carrots, but we don't know ""x."" To find ""x,"" we can add the total number of carrots they picked (which we can find by adding the carrots picked by Faye and her mother) to the number of good carrots they picked (which we've already found) and subtract the bad carrots they picked.

Total carrots picked by Faye and her mother = (x - 23) + (x - 5) (all of their good carrots) + bad carrots

Let's substitute our expressions for bad carrot counts:

Total carrots picked by Faye and her mother = x - 23 + x - 5 + (x - 23)|12 - (x - 5)|12

Simplifying, we get:

x = 63

We now can find the exact number of bad carrots! 

Number of bad carrots picked by Faye = (x - 23) - 12

Number of bad carrots picked by Faye's mother = (x - 5) - 12

Let's plug in our value for ""x:""

Number of bad carrots picked by Faye = (63 - 23) - 12

Number of bad carrots picked by Faye's mother = (63 - 5) - 12

{The final answer is: Faye's garden has a total of 63 carrots, of which only 12 are good. Faye picked 23 carrots, of which 11 were bad. Faye's mother picked 5 carrots, of which 1 also were bad.}</s>",16

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. The total number of flowers Isabel picked is 66. We can use this number to find out how many flowers she used to make bouquets.

2. Isabel made bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. We can use this information to find out how many bouquets she made in total.

3. Let x be the number of bouquets Isabel made. We can set up an equation to find x using the given information:

   Flowers picked = Bouquets made (flowers per bouquet)

   Or,

   The formula is:

   66 = x * 8

4. Next, we know that 10 of the flowers wilted before the wedding. Let w be the number of wilted flowers. We can find the number of flowers still available for the wedding using the number of flowers that wilted.

   66 - 10 = Number of flowers still available

   Or,

   w = 10

   And,

   Final flowers = Initial flowers - Wilted flowers

   Or,

   Final flowers = 66 - 10

5. Let y be the number of bouquets Isabel could still make with the remaining flowers. We can set up another equation to find y using the information we have:

   Final flowers = Bouquets (flowers per bouquet)

   Or,

   The formula is:

   Final flowers = y * 8

6. Now we have two equations with two unknowns (x and y). We can solve for x simultaneously and find both variables.

   First, let's find the value of x:

   Substitute the value of w and Final flowers from step 4 into the initial equation:

   66 - 10 = x * 8

7. Next, calculate y by finding the number of bouquets Isabel could still make after considering the remaining flowers:

   The formula is:

   y = Final flowers / 8

   Or,

   y = (Final flowers) / 8

   Substituting the value of Final Flowers from step 4:

   y = (66 - 10) / 8

8. Now, we have found the values of x and y; we can clearly show each step of our reasoning as follows:

   Isabel picked 66 flowers for her friend’s wedding. She made bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. If 10 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, she could still make {y} bouquets. The final answer is: {y}

   After calculating x, we get:

   Isabel made {x} bouquets in total. The final answer is: {x}

{The final answer is: y = 36 and x = 152}

The answer to our question is: {y} = 36, meaning Isabel could still make 36 bouquets with the remaining flowers after the wilted flowers are removed.

The total number of bouquets Isabel made before the wilted flowers is: {x} = 152.

So, in total, Isabel still has enough flowers for making {(x-y)} additional bouquets after the wedding, where:

{(x-y)} = (152 - 36) = 116.

Therefore, the total number of bouquets Isabel could still make after the wedding is: {(x-y)} + y = 152, which is equivalent to:

{Total Number of Bouquets Possible} = (x-y) + y = (116 + 36) = 152.

The final answer for the total number of bouquets Isabel could still make after the wedding is: {Total Number of Bouquets Possible} = 152.</s>",7

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many tickets Oliver used in total for both the Ferris wheel and the bumper cars.

1. Let's first find out how many tickets Oliver used for the Ferris wheel. Since he rode the Ferris wheel 5 times, and each ride costs 7 tickets, we can multiply 5 and 7 to get the total number of tickets Oliver used for the Ferris wheel.
   - Oliver used 5 rides on the Ferris wheel
   - Each ride cost 7 tickets
   - Total number of tickets for Ferris wheel = 5 x 7 = 35

2. Now, let's find out how many tickets Oliver used for the bumper cars. Since he rode the bumper cars 4 times, and each ride costs 7 tickets, we again multiply 4 and 7.
   - Oliver used 4 rides on the bumper cars
   - Each ride cost 7 tickets
   - Total number of tickets for bumper cars = 4 x 7 = 28

3. Adding the total number of tickets used for the Ferris wheel and the bumper cars, we can find the total number of tickets Oliver used in total.
   - Total number of tickets for Ferris wheel = 35
   - Total number of tickets for bumper cars = 28
   - Total number of tickets Oliver used = 35 + 28 = 63

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it takes Wendy to assemble all eight pieces of furniture (4 chairs and 4 tables) after she spends 6 minutes on each piece.

First, we can calculate the time it takes Wendy to assemble one chair and one table. Let's call the time it takes to assemble a chair x minutes and the time it takes to assemble a table y minutes:

1 chair takes x minutes to assemble
1 table takes y minutes to assemble

Since Wendy bought 4 chairs and 4 tables, she assembled a total of 4 chairs for a total of 4x minutes, and she assembled a total of 4 tables for a total of 4y minutes:

4 chairs take 4x minutes to assemble
4 tables take 4y minutes to assemble

To find the total time it takes Wendy to assemble all eight pieces of furniture, we can add the times it takes to assemble all the chairs and all the tables:

Total chairs time: 4x minutes
Total tables time: 4y minutes

To find the total time it takes Wendy to assemble all the chairs and all the tables (8 pieces of furniture), we add up the times it takes to assemble all the chairs and all the tables:

Total furniture time: Total chairs time + Total tables time

So when Wendy spent 6 minutes on each piece of furniture and assembled a total of 8 pieces, she spent a total of 6*8 = 48 minutes assembling all the furniture.

Therefore, the total time it took Wendy, {including the time to put everything together}, to finish assembling all the furniture is 48 minutes, plus the time it takes her to put everything together (which we don't know from the original problem).

Let's call this additional time t, and the total time it takes Wendy to finish assembling everything is t + 48 minutes:

t + 48 = Total finished time

We can further simplify this equation using the principle of subtracting the known value (48 minutes) and solving for the unknown value (t):

t = Total finished time - 48 minutes

We can now find the total finished time by adding up the times it takes Wendy to assemble all the furniture (48 minutes) and the time it takes her to put it all together (t):

Total finished time = 48 minutes + t

Using what we found in the previous formula, t = Total finished time - 48 minutes, substitute it into the last equation to simplify:

Total finished time = 48 minutes + (Total finished time - 48 minutes)

Simplification: Total finished time - 48 minutes + 48 minutes = Total finished time

So when Wendy spent 6 minutes on each piece of furniture and assembled a total of 8 pieces, it takes her {Total finished time} minutes to finish assembling all the furniture (including the time to put it all together).

Our final answer is: 

The final answer is [Total finished time] minutes.</s>",48

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps and show our reasoning at each stage. 

Let's start with finding the number of good games that Ned had before buying anything (the . Games). We're told that 74 of them didn't work, so we can construct a simple equation to represent this. Let G represent the total number of . Games. Then:

G - 74 = Number of . Games that worked

We don't know the exact value of G, but we can use this equation to find out how many worked. Call this X.

X = G - 74

Next, we know that Ned bought 50 . Games from his friend, and then bought an additional 27 . Games at a garage sale. Let F represent the number of . Games that Ned had before making these purchases, and let N be the number of . Games that he bought from his friend.

F + N = Number of . Games that Ned had before buying anything from the garage sale

Let M be the number of . Games that Ned bought at the garage sale. We can then show how many . Games Ned had after making these purchases.

F + N + M = Number of . Games that Ned had after garage sale

Let's now put everything together. After buying games from his friend and at the garage sale, Ned should have a total number of . Games that worked, which we called X. We can also find the number of . Games that didn't work (call it G2) now that he's bought more:

X + (50 + 27 - X) = G - 74

We can further simplify this:

X + 50 - X = G - 74 - 27

Let's group like terms:

X - X + 50 = G - 101

This simplifies to:

0 = G - 101

This tells us that G (the total number of . Games) is equal to 101. Therefore, as we already know the number of . Games that work, we have a final answer.

X = G - 74

X = 101 - 74

X = 27

So, after buying games from his friend and at the garage sale, Ned has 27 . Games that work, which are good.

{The final answer is: After buying games from his friend and at the garage sale, Ned has 27 . Games that work, which are good.}</s>",3

                     A pet , store , had 38 siamese cats and . 25 house cats. During a sale they ! sold , 45 cats. . How . many cats do they have left? ? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the number of Siamese cats and house cats initially as x and y, respectively. After the sale, the number of Siamese cats and house cats sold is represented by s and h, respectively.

Initially:
X + Y = 38 (number of Siamese cats)

After the sale:
X - s + Y - h = N (number of cats left)

Substituting the given quantities:
X + Y = 38
X - s + Y - 25 = N (the number of cats left)

Let's solve for N:

Y = 38 - X (isolating X and Y)
N = X - s + 38 - 25 - s (substituting and factoring out X)
N = X - s - 3 (simplifying)

Let's solve for X:
X = N + s + 3 (adding s and 3 to get X)

Backslash substitution gives:
Y = N + s + 3 - 38 (simplifying)
Y = -(38 - N - s) (factoring out the negative sign)

But, as you can see, Y can't be negative; hence, our original assumption about Y is wrong. The number of house cats can't be greater than the number of Siamese cats. To fix this, we'll assume our initial house cats are fewer than or equal to the number of Siamese cats.

Let's represent the number of house cats as x.

X + x = 38 (initially, X is less than or equal to 38)

After the sale:
X - s + x - 25 = N (number of cats left)

Let's solve for N:

2x = 38 + 25 (factoring out 2)
x = (38 + 25) / 2 (simplifying)

We'll calculate X again:
X = (38 - x) + x = 38 (simplifying)

Let's calculate N again in terms of x:

N = X - s - 25 + s = 38 - 25 = 13 (simplifying)

So, the store has 13 cats left after selling 45 cats.

The final answer is 13.</s>",18

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. We need to keep track of Carol's score at the end of each round. In the first round, she scored 17 points, so her score after the first round is 17 points. {The final answer is: After the first round, Carol had 17 points.}

2. In the second round, Carol scored 6 points. We need to find out her total score at the end of the second round. To do this, we add her score from the first round to her score from the second round. After the second round, Carol had a total of 17 points from the first round and 6 points from the second round, making her total score 23 points. {The final answer is: After the second round, Carol had 23 points.}

3. In the final round, Carol scored 10 points. We also need to keep track of how many points she lost in the final round. From the question, we know that Carol lost 16 points in the final round. We can find out how many points she had at the end of the game by subtracting the 16 points she lost from her total score at the end of the second round. Her total score after the final round is her total score after the second round minus the 16 points she lost in the final round. After the final round, Carol had a total of 23 points from the second round, and she lost 16 points in the final round, leaving her with a total of 7 points at the end of the game. {The final answer is: After the final round, Carol had 7 points.}

4. We can put it altogether to get the final answer. During the game, Carol scored 17 points in the first round, 6 points in the second round, and 10 points in the final round. She also lost 16 points in the final round, leaving her with a total of 7 points at the end of the game. {The final answer is: After the game, Carol had 7 points.}

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. Here's how we can reason through it:

1. Let's call the number of boxes that Dave's little brother received x. This means that Dave originally purchased 12 - x boxes of chocolate candy.

2. The problem tells us that each box contains 3 pieces of candy. So, we can calculate the total number of pieces in the boxes that Dave still has as follows:

   a. The number of pieces in the boxes that Dave still has is 3 times the number of boxes he still has.

   b. From Step 1, we know that Dave still has 12 - x boxes.

   c. Therefore, the total number of pieces in these boxes is:

      (12 - x) * 3

3. However, we also know that Dave gave some of these pieces to his little brother, leaving him with fewer pieces than before. Let's call the number of pieces that Dave still has after giving some to his brother y.

4. In Step 2, we calculated the number of pieces that Dave still had in terms of the number of boxes he still had (12-x). Let's now calculate the number of boxes Dave still has in terms of the number of pieces he still has (y).

   a. Since there are 3 pieces in each box, we can express the number of boxes in terms of our second unknown quantity, y, as follows:

      y / 3

5. Now, we can use Step 4 to express Step 2 in terms of y instead of (12-x).

6. Substituting Step 5 into Step 2 and simplifying gives us:

   y = (12-x) * 3 / 2

7. We now have two equations involving our two unknown quantities x and y:

   a. When Dave gave some pieces to his brother, he still had y pieces left.

   b. Dave gave x boxes of candy to his brother, leaving him with y pieces.

8. Let's set up a system of equations involving our two unknowns and solve it.

   a. First equation: y = (12-x) * 3 / 2

   b. Second equation: x * 3 = y

9. We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 3 to isolate x:

   b1. x = y / 3

10. Let's now substitute Step 9 into Step a, the first equation:

   y = (12 - y/3) * 3 / 2

11. Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

   y = (12 * 2 - y) / 2

12. Apply the quadratic formula to solve for y:

   y = (-12 +/ 12*2) / 2

13. Since the value under the square root sign is negative, the other solution would give us an imaginary number, which doesn't make physical sense in this problem. So, we pick the positive solution:

   y = 12

14. Now we can find x, the number of boxes Dave gave to his little brother, by substituting y=12 into Step b1:

   x = 12 * 3 / 12

   x = 3*12 = 36

15. Therefore, Dave originally bought 12 boxes and gave his little brother 36 boxes, leaving him with 12 boxes. Each box originally contained 3 pieces, so Dave still has 12 * 3 = 36 pieces.

   {The final answer is: After giving 36 boxes (containing 108 pieces) to his little brother, Dave still had 36 pieces left (a total of 144 pieces).}

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of customers at the end of the lunch rush when there were 39 customers initially.

Let the number of customers at the end of the lunch rush be x. The number of customers who didn't leave a tip is 49, and the number of customers who left a tip is x-49. If 49 out of the 39 initial customers didn't leave a tip, then we can find the percentage of customers who didn't leave a tip in the initial 39 customers as follows:

39 - 49 = -10 (not possible)

So, we'll assume that initially all 39 customers left a tip. This means that the number of customers who left a tip initially was also 39. After the lunch rush, 12 additional customers came, meaning there were a total of x+12 customers at the end of the lunch rush. Therefore, we can formulate the following equation:

x = 39 + 12 - (49 - 39)

x = 77 - 49

x = 28

2. Find the number of customers who left a tip.

Let the number of customers who left a tip be y. Then the number of customers who didn't leave a tip was x-y. We already know that 49 out of 39 initial customers didn't leave a tip, meaning the number of customers who initially left a tip was 39. After the lunch rush, 12 additional customers came, meaning the total number of customers who left a tip was y + 12. Using the percentage of customers who didn't leave a tip that we calculated in step 1, we can find x as a percentage of the total number of customers who left a tip:

x = (1 - 0.49) * y * 100

We know that x was found to be 28, and we also found that y was the number of customers who left a tip. Thus, we can equate the above expression with our previous finding:

x = 28

(1 - 0.49) * y * 100 = 28

91 * y = 28,000

y = 308.86

Since we can't have a decimal number of customers, we round down to 308.

Final Answer: {The number of customers who left a tip was 308.}</s>",2

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Step 1: Solve for the number of apples left over after distributing 5 to each student for lunch.

50 : : apples (fractional notation)
5 apples per student distributed for lunch
Remaining apples = 50 - 5(number of students)

Step 2: Find the number of students who received apples for lunch using the formula for part of a whole.

5 : 50 = ? : x
x represents the number of students
50 divided into 5 is 10
Number of students who received apples for lunch = 10

Step 3: Use substitution to find the number of remaining apples after lunch.

Remaining apples = 50 - 5(10) = 0

Step 4: Realizing that there can't be any remaining apples, go back to step 1 to confirm any mistakes.

This step reveals that since there are no remaining apples, the ! in the question is incorrect. As such, we will use the : sign instead.

Step 5: Find the number of pies made using the amount of apples leftover after lunch.

x : : apples (fractional notation)
x apples left after lunch
Each pie takes 5 apples
Number of pies that can be made = x divided by 5

Step 6: Substitute the value calculated in step 2 for x to find the number of pies made.

5 : 50 = 10 : x
10 apples were distributed to each student for lunch
Number of students who received apples for lunch = 10

Number of apples left over after lunch = 50 - 100 = -50 (This is incorrect - we can't have a negative number of apples.)

We can infer that there must be an error in the question.

In solving this question, we did not get a final answer as we found that the question is flawed.

If we were to assume that there are still some left over apples after lunch, we could continue to solve the rest of the problem. However, since we can't have a negative number of apples, we concluded that there is an error in how the original question was phrased.

To fix the question, we can change the amount of apples distributed to each student for lunch or assume that all the apples were used for lunch instead of making pies.

{The final answer is} unknown due to a flaw in the question.

Let's call the total amount of money Oliver had in January, x.

When March arrived, Oliver had already spent $4. His remaining balance was $x - 33 - 4 = x - 37.

After receiving $32 from his mom, Oliver had a total of $32 + (x - 37) = x - 5 dollars.

So, the total amount of money Oliver had after getting money from his mom was $x - 5.

We want to find the value of x.

Let's rearrange our equation to make x the subject:

$x - 5 = 32 + (x - 37)$

$x - 5 = x - 37 - 32$

$0 = x - 7$

$x = 7$

So, Oliver had $7 dollars at the end of March.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's first identify the unknowns: the school or cafeteria and the action they took with the apples. We'll represent the school/cafeteria with an S or C, and the action with a colon and a verb in parentheses. Here's how we might approach it:

1. The S school : distributed had 14 apples.
   If S used 13 to make lunch for the students, how many apples would they have left?
   First, let's find out how many apples S had left by subtracting the number of apples used to make lunch (13) from the total number of apples (14):
   
   S left = 14 - 13
   
   S left = 1 apple
   
   {The final answer is: The S school had 1 apple left.}

2. The C cafeteria : sold had 14 apples.
   If C used 13 to sell to students, and then bought 49 more, how many apples would they have?
   First, we find out how many apples C sold by subtracting the number of apples left (1) from the number used to sell to students (13):
   
   C sold = 13 - 1
   
   C sold = 12 apples
   Next, we add the apples C bought to the apples they had left to find out how many apples they would have in total:
   
   Total C apples = C sold + 49 + 1
   
   Total C apples = 12 + 49 + 1
   
   Total C apples = 62 apples
   
   {The final answer is: The C cafeteria had 62 apples in total.}

Both S and C ended up with the same number of apples (1 + 62 = 63), indicating that they both used up all the apples in the end.

In summary:
1. The S school had 1 apple left.
2. The C cafeteria had 62 apples in total.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Find the number of questions Frank answered correctly in the first half.
   Frank answered 3 questions correctly in the first half.
2. Find the number of questions Frank answered correctly in the second half.
   Frank answered 2 questions correctly in the second half.
3. Calculate the total number of questions Frank answered in the game.
   Since the problem mentions the first and second half, we can assume that there are an equal number of questions in each half. Let's say there are n questions in each half.
   Thus, the total number of questions Frank answered is 2n questions.
4. Find the score for each correct answer.
   Each correct answer is worth 3 points.
5. Calculate the score for the correct answers in the first half.
   Frank answered 3 questions correctly in the first half, each worth 3 points, which makes a total score of 9 points for the first half.
6. Calculate the score for the correct answers in the second half.
   Frank answered 2 questions correctly in the second half, each worth 3 points, which makes a total score of 6 points for the second half.
7. Add the scores from steps 5 and 6 to find the total score for all correct answers.
8. Compare the total score for all correct answers to the total number of questions Frank answered.
   If each correct answer is worth 3 points, then the total score for all correct answers (steps 5 and 6) is 15 points.
   Frank answered a total of 2n questions, as we found in step 3.
   Now we divide the total score for all correct answers (15 points) by the total number of questions Frank answered (2n questions), and multiply by 100 to get a percentage.
   This percentage will give us the percentage of questions Frank answered correctly (also known as his accuracy score).
   This accuracy score is worth 3 points per question, so to find Frank's overall score (in points), we can multiply his accuracy score by the total number of questions Frank answered.
9. Calculate Frank's accuracy score (percentage).
   The accuracy score is the total score for all correct answers (15 points) divided by the total number of questions Frank answered (2n questions).
   The formula for accuracy score (percentage) is:
    accuracy score = (total score for all correct answers / total number of questions) * 100
    accuracy score = (15 points / (2n questions)) * 100
10. Calculate Frank's overall score (in points) based on the accuracy score.
   Frank answered a total of 2n questions.
   Now we can find out how many of those questions he answered correctly, which is the number of questions that earn us points.
   We know that Frank answered this many questions correctly based on his accuracy score (step 9).
   To find out the number of points Frank earned based on those correct answers, we multiply the total score for all correct answers (step 6 or Step 7) by the number of questions he answered correctly (step 9).
   This number of points is the overall score Frank achieved in the trivia game.
   And that final score, in points, is what we're looking for.

<|assistant|>
Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Zoe unboxed some winter clothes. We don't know how many, but we'll keep track of the number as we go.

2. We're told that Zoe found 8 boxes of clothing. Each box contained 4 scarves and 6 mittens.

3. We don't know how many pieces of winter clothing were in each box before it was unboxed, but we can calculate this by adding the number of scarves and mittens:

   - Before each box was unboxed, there were 4 scarves and 6 mittens, for a total of 10 pieces of winter clothing.

4. We know that there were a total of 8 boxes. Let's call the number of winter clothes in each box x. We can calculate the total number of winter clothes in all the boxes like this:

   - There are x winter clothes in each box.
   - There are 8 boxes.
   - Altogether, there are 8x winter clothes.

5. Now let's calculate the total number of scarves and mittens in all the boxes:

   - Before any boxes were unboxed, there were 8 boxes, each with 4 scarves. So there were 32 scarves in total, before any were unboxed.
   - There were also 8 boxes, each with 6 mittens. This means there were 48 mittens in total, before any were unboxed.

6. Let's check our answers:

   - We already know there were 32 scarves and 48 mittens before any boxes were unboxed.
   - The total number of winter clothes in all the boxes was 8x.
   - If we calculate the total number of scarves and mittens, we find:

   - The total number of scarves is 32 + (8 boxes * 4 scarves per box) = 40 scarves.
   - The total number of mittens is 48 + (8 boxes * 6 mittens per box) = 48 mittens.
   - Since we already know there were 32 scarves and 48 mittens before any boxes were unboxed, they should still have a total of 80 pieces of clothing (40 scarves and 48 mittens).

7. We know there were 8x winter clothes in all the boxes. If we add the number of scarves and mittens, we get:

   - Altogether, there were x scarves and 6x mittens in all the boxes. Since we know there were a total of 80 pieces of clothing, we can use equations to find x:

   - There were a total of 80 pieces of clothing.
   - There were x scarves and 6x mittens.
   - We know that the total number of scarves and mittens was 32 + (8 boxes * (4 scarves + 6 mittens)) = 80.

8. Let's calculate the total number of winter clothes that Zoe had when she finished unboxing everything:

   - We know that there were 8 boxes and that Zoe found each box when she unboxed.
   - The first box had x winter clothes.
   - Each subsequent box also had x winter clothes, for a grand total of 8x winter clothes.
   - Also, we know that Zoe found a total of 8x winter clothes in all the boxes.
   - So there should be a grand total of 8x + (8x pieces of clothing + (4 scarves + 6 mittens) * x) = 10x pieces of winter clothing.
   - This is the final answer we were looking for, and we know it's correct because:

   - We've already calculated that there were 80 pieces of winter clothing when all the boxes were closed.
   - When all the boxes were opened, there were 10x pieces of winter clothing.
   - Since we know that the scarves and mittens came in sets of 4 and 6, respectively, there should still be the same number of each when all the boxes were opened.
   - Therefore, we can calculate the number of scarves and mittens that Zoe had when she finished unboxing:

   - We started with 8 boxes, each with 4 scarves, for a grand",80

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can first set up a system of equations to represent the given information.

Let x be the cost of one deck. Then the cost of 3 decks for Frank and 2 decks for his friend would be:

Frank: 3 decks at $x$ each = 3x dollars
Friend: 2 decks at $x$ each = 2x dollars

We are also given that each deck costs $7! (read as ""7 dollars each"") which includes an exclamation mark to show that it should be read as ""dollars"" in this context. This exclamation mark can be thought of as an additional character that is not part of the price, so let's call the price of a deck, before the exclamation mark, simply ""p"". Then we can say that:

x = p!

Next, we need to find the total amount they spent. Frank's cost plus the magic shop's cost for the trick & decks is the total amount spent, which we'll call ""total"". Then:

total = Frank's cost + magic shop's cost
     = 3x + cost of trick & decks

The cost of the trick & decks is unknown, but we know that each deck costs $7! and there were 5 decks total (3 from Frank and 2 from his friend), so the total cost of the decks is:

deck cost = 5 decks at $p!$ each = 5p! dollars

To find the magic shop's cost, note that they charged $7! per deck, so there was some extra charge for the trick - we'll call this ""extra"". Then:

total = Frank's cost + deck cost + extra
     = 3x + 5p! + extra

We can rearrange this equation and isolate the total spent to get:

total - 5p! = 3x + extra

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

total - 5p! = 3x + extra    (1)
3x + 5p! = total               (2)

We can solve this system using the elimination method. First, multiply equation (1) by 3 and subtract it from equation (2). This eliminates ""x"":

3(total - 5p!) = 3(3x + extra) - 5x - extra

Expanding and simplifying:

9p! - 9p! = 9x

9p! = 9x

Divide both sides by 9:

p! = x

Now, to find the total amount spent, substitute x = p! into equation (2):

total = 3(p!) + 5(p!) = 8p!

We can see that each person paid a certain total for their tricks and decks, and then they paid an additional amount for the trick, for a total shared by both of them.

Since we solved for ""x"" in terms of ""p!"", we don't really need to know the value of ""p!"" to get the final answer. But, looking back at how we calculated ""x"" in terms of ""p!"", we can see that there was an exclamation mark involved in the ""price"" of a deck. This is different from the ""cost"" we used in our equations, which did not have an exclamation mark. It's important to keep track of what you are representing with various symbols, or variables, as this can make a difference in the result you get.

The final answer is: they spent a total of 8 times the price of a single deck, with an exclamation mark. Excluding the exclamation mark, each deck cost $p$ dollars.

However, some important numbers from the problem are the actual costs in dollars for each deck (which we didn't calculate directly), and we can approximate those costs:

Frank's decks cost $3 \cdot p!$ dollars, and his friend's decks cost $2 \cdot p!$ dollars. So, we can add up their costs to get the total cost for both friends (without the trick) and approximate this cost using the approximation that $x \approx 3.69$ (when $p \approx 10$). Then:

total decks cost = $3 \cdot p! + 2 \cdot p!$ dollars

                    question:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can create two separate equations, one for the short sleeve shirts and one for the long sleeve shirts. Here are the steps:

Equation for the short sleeve shirts:
1. Let x represent the number of short sleeve shirts Sam did not wash before school.
2. We know he washed 29 short sleeve shirts, so the total number of short sleeve shirts he washed is 29 + x.
3. The original number of short sleeve shirts he had was 40.
4. We can set up an equation to represent our information using symbolic notation:
   - (29 + x) is the number of short sleeve shirts Sam washed.
   - 40 is the original number of short sleeve shirts Sam had.
   - We want to find the number of short sleeve shirts Sam did not wash (x).
   - So, we have (29 + x) = 40.

Equation for the long sleeve shirts:
1. Let y represent the number of long sleeve shirts Sam did not wash before school.
2. We know he washed 23 long sleeve shirts, so the total number of long sleeve shirts he washed is 23 + y.
3. This time, though, we do not know the original number of long sleeve shirts he had.
4. We can guess at a number for this, but to be precise, we should wait until we figure out how many short sleeve shirts he did not wash, as that should help inform our guess.
5. For now, though, let's assume that Sam had the same number of long sleeve shirts as he did short sleeve shirts (this is not necessarily true, but it simplifies our math).
6. The original number of long sleeve shirts Sam had is then 40 (since we assumed the same number as short sleeve shirts).
7. We can set up an equation to represent our information using symbolic notation:
   - (23 + y) is the number of long sleeve shirts Sam washed.
   - 40 is the original number of long sleeve shirts Sam had.
   - We want to find the number of long sleeve shirts Sam did not wash (y).
   - So, we have (23 + y) = 40.

Now that we have created separate equations for each type of shirt, let's put them together and figure out what happened:

1. We know from the information presented that Sam had a total of 63 shirts to wash before school.
   - 40 short sleeve shirts.
   - 23 long sleeve shirts (assuming he had the same number as short sleeve).
2. 29 of those 63 shirts were short sleeve shirts.
3. Therefore, we can subtract 29 from the 40 short sleeve shirts to find out how many short sleeve shirts he did not wash.
   - 40 - 29 = 11.
4. This means we know how many short sleeve shirts he did not wash.
5. We can substitute this value into our equation for the short sleeve shirts to solve for x, which will tell us the exact number of short sleeve shirts that Sam did not wash before school (regardless of whether our long sleeve shirt guess is right).
6. To substitute x into our equation for short sleeve shirts:
(29 + 11) = 40.
   - 40 = 40. This is true, so we know that our equation is correct.
7. Solving for x:
(29 + x) = 40.
    40 - 29 = x.
   - Substitute 11 for the number of short sleeve shirts he did not wash, and then we simply simplify our expression for x.
   - x = 11.
8. Now, because we don't know how many long sleeve shirts he originally had, we cannot simply substitute 11 for our x value to solve for our y (long sleeve shirt) equation.
9. However, we can use the value for x to determine how many short sleeve shirts he had at the outset (i.e., before washing any).
10. To do this, we simply combine the original number of short sleeve shirts (40) with the number he did not wash (11), giving us an updated total number of short sleeve shirts (29).

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of customers initially served by the waiter as x.

Given information:
- The waiter had 47 customers to wait on. (x = 47)
- 41 customers left, so the number of remaining customers is (x - 41).
- The waiter got another 20 customers, so the total number of customers after receiving more is (x - 41 + 20).
- We need to find the number of customers the waiter would have after this, which is (x - 41 + 20) since we've already incorporated new customers and removed the ones who left.

Putting it all together:

x - 41 + 20 = {The final answer is} y

Simplify:

y = x - 21

Substitute the initial value for x:

y = 47 - 21

Evaluate:

y = 26 (number of customers the waiter would have after new arrivals and departures)

{The final answer is} 26.</s>",26
