Step 1: Calculate the number of songs Paige had on her MP3 player before deleting any.

Let x be the number of songs Paige had on her MP3 player before deleting any.

x = 11

Step 2: Calculate the number of old songs Paige deleted.

Let y be the number of old songs Paige deleted.

y = 9

Step 3: Calculate the total number of songs (old and new) Paige had on her MP3 player after deleting the old songs.

Let z be the total number of songs (old and new) Paige had on her MP3 player after deleting the old songs.

z = x - y

Substitute x and y from Step 1 and Step 2 into the equation above.

z = 11 - 9

Step 4: Calculate the number of new songs Paige added after deleting the old songs.

Let n be the number of new songs Paige added after deleting the old songs.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Step 1: Determine the total number of students who tried out.
  39 girls and 4 boys tried out, so the total number of students is 39 + 4 = 43.

Step 2: Find the number of students who made the cut.
  The number of students who got called back is 26.

Step 3: Find the number of students who didn't make the cut, or were cut from the team.
  The number of students who didn't make the cut is the difference between the total number of students who tried out and the number of students who got called back.
  43 students tried out, and 26 of them got called back, so 43 - 26 = 17 students didn't make the cut.

The final answer is: 17 students didn't make the cut, or were cut from the team.</s>",17

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of coloring books Faye had before giving away three of them as x. Therefore, Faye had 34 coloring books initially, which can be written as x.

When she gave away 3 coloring books, the number reduced to (x - 3) coloring books.

Next, Faye bought 48 more coloring books. Thus, the total number of coloring books she had became the sum of the number she had after giving away 3 books (x - 3) and the number she bought (48). We can write this mathematically as follows:

Total number of coloring books = (x - 3) + 48

We simplify this expression by combining like terms and solving for x as follows:

Total number of coloring books = x - 3 + 48

Total number of coloring books = x + 45

We can identify the total number of coloring books as our final answer. The final answer is:

Faye has a total of x + 45 coloring books.

Now, we have two pieces of information; Faye initially had 34 coloring books and after buying and giving away some, she had a total of x + 45 coloring books. We can equate these two to find the value of x as follows:

34 = x + 45

x = 34 - 45

x = -11

However, since we are dealing with the number of coloring books, we can not have a negative number. In this scenario, it could mean Faye has returned a few more coloring books, instead of giving them away. In any case, we can assume that there is an error in the given scenario. Since we can not have a negative number of coloring books, the answer is indeterminate.

In summary, the final answer for our calculation is:

Faye has a total of 45 coloring books [{The final answer is:}]</s>",79

<|assistant|>
Step 1: The school cafeteria had a total of 23 apples.

Step 2: They used 20 of these apples to make lunch for the students.

Step 3: This left the cafeteria with a remaining number of apples, which can be found by subtracting the number of apples used (20) from the original number of apples (23).

Step 4: Therefore, the cafeteria had 3 apples remaining after 20 were used for lunch: 23 - 20 = 3.

Step 5: After making lunch, the school cafeteria bought an additional 6 apples. This brings the total number of apples they have to the sum of the 3 remaining apples and the 6 new apples.

Step 6: Therefore, the cafeteria now has a total of 9 apples, found by adding the number of apples they had remaining (3) to the number of apples they purchased (6): 3 + 6 = 9.

Step 7: The final answer is: {The final number of apples in the school cafeteria is 9.}</s>",9

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find the number of points earned by defeating all the enemies in the video game level, we first count the total number of enemies. If there are 11 enemies and we destroy all but 3 of them, then we are left with 3 enemies. Let's call the number of points earned by destroying all the enemies x.

Then, we can set up an equation to find x:

11 enemies, each worth 9 points, gives us a total of 99 points.

x out of 11 enemies, each worth 9 points, gives us x * 9 points.

Destroying all enemies except the remaining 3, we find the points earned by defeated enemies to be 9 * (11 - 3) = 72.

The points earned by defeating the remaining 3 enemies is given by 3 * 9 = 27.

So, the total points earned from defeating all the enemies is x * 9 + 72 + 27.

We also have the relationship that points earned from defeating all the enemies is equal to 11 * 9 = 99.

Now, let's substitute the relationship we found earlier into our previous equation:

11 * 9 = x * 9 + 72 + 27

Subtracting x * 9 from both sides, we get:

0 = x * 9 - x * 9 + 72 + 27

Simplifying this equation, we get:

0 = 72 + 27

The sum of 72 and 27 is 99, so we know that total points earned is 99.

The final answer is 99 points earned by defeating all the enemies in the level.

{The final answer is 99.}</s>",72
" Megan earned 8 points for each bag of cans : she recycled. If , she had 14 bags, but didn't ; recycle 5 of them, how many points would she have earned? ","<|user|>

                    question:
                     Megan earned 8 points for each bag of cans : she recycled. If , she had 14 bags, but didn't ; recycle 5 of them, how many points would she have earned? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Steps:
1. First, we need to find out how many points Megan earned for recycling 14 bags. Since she earned 8 points for each bag, we can use multiplication to calculate:
  Megan earned 8 points for each of the 14 bags, so she earned a total of 112 points for recycling all 14 bags (14 x 8 = 112).
2. Next, we know that Megan didn't recycle 5 bags. Since we've already calculated how many points she earned for recycling all 14 bags, we need to figure out how many of those points came from the bags she didn't recycle. To do this, we can use subtraction to find how many points Megan earned for recycling the 9 remaining bags (she earned 8 points for each of the 9 bags, so 9 x 8 = 72 points). However, she also earned points for the 5 bags she didn't recycle. Let's say the number of points Megan earned for each of these 5 bags is x. Since we're not sure how many points Megan earned for each of these bags, let's write this calculation as an expression:
  Megan earned x points for each of the 5 bags she didn't recycle, so she earned a total of 5x points for these bags (5 x x = 5x).
3. Putting these calculations together, we now know that Megan earned a total of 112 points for recycling all 14 bags, and she earned an additional 5x points for the 5 bags she didn't recycle. So her total number of points earned from recycling is:
  112 points for recycling the first 9 bags (9 x 8 = 72), and 5x points for recycling the next 5 bags (5 bags x x points per bag).
4. To find out how many points Megan actually earned, we need to determine the value of x (the number of points Megan earned for each of the 5 bags she didn't recycle). Since we know that in total, Megan earned a total of 14 x 8 = 112 points for recycling, and she earned an additional 5x points for the bags she didn't recycle, we can equate these calculations. This gives us:
  Megan earned 112 points for recycling the first 9 bags (9 x 8 = 72), and she earned 5x points for recycling the next 5 bags, for a total of 14 x 8 = 112 points (the total number of points she earned from recycling).
  Combining the first and second calculations, we get:
   112 points (for recycling the first 9 bags), and 144 points (x points for each of the 5 bags she didn't recycle) = 112 + 144 = 256 points in total (the total number of points Megan earned from recycling).
   Therefore, we know that Megan earned x points per bag for the 5 bags she didn't recycle, and with the equation above, we can solve for x:
  x points per bag (for the 5 bags she didn't recycle) = (144 points total for these 5 bags) / (5 bags) = (256 total points for all 14 bags) / (9 recycled bags + 5 not recycled bags) = 144 points / 14 bags = 10.31 points per bag.
5. So Megan earned 10.31 points per bag for the 5 bags she didn't recycle. This brings our earlier calculations to a complete understanding, and we can say with certainty that Megan earned 10.31 points per bag for these bags.
6. We can apply this information to our beginning steps. In the first calculation, Megan earned 8 points for each of the 14 bags, for a total of 112 points. However, we now know that Megan earned 10.31 points per bag for the 5 bags she didn't recycle, so let's adjust those calculations to reflect this added information:
  Megan earned 8 points per bag for recycling the first 9 bags (8 points per bag times 9 bags = 72 points), and she",72
".  April's discount : flowers was having a sale where each rose was 4 dollars. If April ? started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left, how much money : did she earn? ","<|user|>

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    .  April's discount : flowers was having a sale where each rose was 4 dollars. If April ? started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left, how much money : did she earn? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
April's discount : flowers can be written in math terms as a percentage, where discount represents the percentage discount and flowers represents the original price of each rose. Since each rose was $4 during the sale, we can say that the discount was a 0% (no discount) and the original price was also $4, which means that discount and flowers are both 0.

April started with 13 roses, so she spent $4 (original price) times 13 (number of roses) = $52 (total cost) on the initial roses.

During the sale, April continued buying roses. Since she had 4 roses left and she started with 13, she must have bought 9 more roses (13-4 = 9). At $4 each, she spent $36 (total cost) on the additional roses.

So in total, April spent $52 (initial cost) plus $36 (additional cost) = $88 (total cost).

However, we also need to find out how much money she earned from selling the roses she had left. Since she bought each rose for $4 and sold them for $4, she earned $16 for each of the 4 remaining roses, which equals $64 (total earnings).

So in total, she earned $64 (earnings) minus $88 (total cost), resulting in a total profit of $24.

Therefore, the final answer can be represented as the formula: 

problem: April's discount : flowers (0% discount and original price of $4)
start: 13 roses at $52 (cost)
buy: 9 more roses at $36 (additional cost)
sell: 4 roses at $64 (earnings)
total cost: $88
resulting profit: $24

{The final answer is: April's net profit was $24 from selling flowers during the sale, where each rose was sold for $4 during the sale and she started with 13 roses at $52, and bought an additional 9 roses at $36 during the sale.}</s>",36

                    question:
                     Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many ! did he not wash? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Step 1: Find the total number of shirts Ned had to wash.

Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts before school.

Total number of shirts = 9 short sleeve shirts + 21 long sleeve shirts

= 30 short sleeve shirts (as each short sleeve shirt is counted once) + 21 long sleeve shirts (as each long sleeve shirt is counted once)

= 51 shirts in total

Step 2: Find how many of these shirts Ned actually washed.

Ned had washed 29 shirts by the time school started.

Number of shirts Ned had washed = 29

Step 3: Find how many shirts Ned did not wash.

Total number of shirts - Number of shirts Ned had washed = Number of shirts Ned did not wash

51 - 29 = Number of shirts Ned did not wash

= 22 shirts (as the total number of shirts was 51 and Ned had washed 29)

Step 4: Find how many of the shirts Ned did not wash were long sleeve shirts.

We know that Ned had washed 21 long sleeve shirts before school and that he did not wash 22 shirts in total (short sleeve and long sleeve).

Let x be the number of long sleeve shirts that Ned did not wash.

The total number of long sleeve shirts Ned did not wash was x long sleeve shirts.

We also know that the total number of shirts Ned did not wash was 22, of which x were long sleeve shirts and the remaining were short sleeve shirts.

So, the total number of short sleeve shirts Ned did not wash was 22 - x.

We also know that Ned had already washed 9 short sleeve shirts before school.

So, the total number of short sleeve shirts Ned had not washed by the time school started was (22 - x) short sleeve shirts + 0 (as he had already washed the 9 by school) = (22 - x) short sleeve shirts.

Step 5: Find the number of short sleeve shirts Ned did not wash.

Let y be the number of short sleeve shirts Ned did not wash.

The total number of short sleeve shirts Ned did not wash was y short sleeve shirts.

Step 6: Find the total number of shirts Ned did not wash.

The total number of shirts Ned did not wash was x long sleeve shirts and y short sleeve shirts.

= (22 - x) short sleeve shirts + x long sleeve shirts (as 1 long sleeve shirt is equivalent to x short sleeve shirts)

= (22 - x) short sleeve shirts + (22 - x) long sleeve shirts (as we already know how many long sleeve shirts Ned did not wash)

= 2(22 - x) shirts

Hence, the total number of shirts Ned did not wash was 2(22 - x) shirts.

Step 7: Find how many shirts Ned had washed in total.

We already know that Ned had washed 29 shirts by the time school started.

Let z be the number of shirts Ned had washed before he washed the 29 by school.

The total number of shirts Ned had washed was (z + 29) shirts.

Step 8: Find the total number of shirts Ned had washed.

The total number of shirts Ned had washed was the number of shirts he had already washed (z shirts) plus the number of shirts he had washed by the time school started (29 shirts).

= (z + 29) shirts

Step 9: Compare the values of the total number of shirts Ned had washed and the total number of shirts Ned did not wash.

Since we have expressions for both the total number of shirts Ned had washed and the total number of shirts Ned did not wash, we can find out whether Ned had washed more shirts or had not washed as many shirts as he should have.

If (z + 29) > 2(22 - x), this would mean that Ned had washed more shirts than he had not washed.

If (z + 29) < 2(22 - x), this would",1

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Let x be the number of tables needed for the luncheon.

2. We are given that the company invited 84 people (47 minus 37, where 37 is the number of people who did not show up) to the luncheon.

3. We know that each table could hold 5 people. Therefore, the number of people that can be seated at one table is 5.

4. To calculate the number of people that each table can seat after 7 people did not show up, we use the formula:

     Total number of people seated at one table - Number of seats empty = Number of people seated

     For example, if a table could seat 5 people, but 2 seats were empty because of the no-shows, then that table could seat a total of 3 people (5 - 2).

5. Applying this formula to our situation (and remembering to subtract the empty seats due to no-shows), we get:

     Number of people seated at one table after no-shows = 5 - 7 = 8

     Since each table originally held 5 people, some of the tables would now have 3 empty seats (due to the no-shows) and some would have 8 people.

6. How many tables would be needed to accommodate initially 84 people, now with an additional 8 empty seats on each table?

     We divide the total number of seats needed by the number of seats needed for one table:

     Total seats (including empty seats): 84 (initial guest list) + 2 (empty seats at each table) × 8 = 72

     Number of seats per table: 8

     Number of tables needed: Total seats / Number of seats per table = 72 / 8 = 9

7. Therefore, the company will need 9 tables (including empty seats) for this luncheon, {The final answer is 9}.</s>",8

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Step 1: Tom had 5 books initially. {The initial number of books Tom had is 5.}

Step 2: Tom sold 4 of his books. The number of books Tom had after selling 4 of them is:

5 - 4 = 1 book

{After selling 4 books, Tom had 1 book left.}

Step 3: Let's find out how much money Tom earned by selling the 4 books. Let's call the price of each book x. Then, Tom earned:

4 * x = 4x

{The price of each book is x.}

Step 4: Tom used the money he earned to buy 38 new books. Let's find out how much he had to pay for each book. Let's call the amount Tom had to pay for each book, y. Then, Tom had to pay:

38 * y = 4x

Equation: 38y = 4x

Step 5: We want to figure out how many books Tom has now. Let's call that number z. Tom has this many books after buying the 38 with the money from selling the other 4:

z = 1 + 38

{Tom had 1 book left, and then he bought 38 new books, so the total number of books he has now is z.}

Step 6: Let's find out how much it costs Tom to buy each book. Let's call that price zy:

z = 1 + 38
1 = z - 38
z - 38 = 1
z - 38 = 1/1
z - 38 = 1/38

{Thus, the price of each remaining book would be zy, with z being the number of books now and y being the price per book, so the price per book is zy.}

Step 7: Let's find out how much money Tom has left after buying all these new books. Let's call it left money. After buying z books, Tom has:

left money = 4x - 38zy

{The remaining money after buying z books at a price of zy is our left money. Before buying the books, he received 4x. So the total left is 4x - the total price of z new books he bought, which is zy*z, so it's 4x - 38zy.}

Step 8: Let's compare the money Tom spent on buying z new books and the money he received by selling his initial 4 books:

38y = 4x

z * zy = 4 * x

{We compare the two costs now. Note that, in the first line, we calculated how much each book costs as zy, which is the price per book for the new ones now. In the second line, we calculated how much each of the old books was previously selling for as x, which is the price per book for his old books, and here it is being multiplied by four since there are four books being sold.}

Step 9: Let's compare the two costs of the two calculations:

z * zy = 4 * x

z * zy = 4 * (38y / z)

z * zy = 152y

z = +- 12.5 books

{In order to make both sides of the calculations equal each other, we have to find a valid number of books left (z). We can't have 0 books left since that would imply no profit. So z must be a positive integer. After some simple algebra and calculating, we derive that z can only be either 13 or -13. Since we can't have negative numbers of books, z is 12.5, which we round up to 13.}

Step 10: So, Tom has 13 books remaining. He had 5 initially, he sold 4, and now he has another 13, so:

Total books Tom has now = 5 + 13 = 18 books

{The total number of books Tom has is the sum of his first 5 books, the 4 he sold, and the 13 he bought with the money he made from selling the others.}

{The final answer is 18 books.}</s>",39

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many regular sodas and how many diet sodas there are in total, and then determine how many shelves will be needed to fit all of the sodas.

Let's start by finding the total number of regular sodas. We know that Jerry bought 41 regular sodas, so this is our starting point. No other information is given about regular sodas, so we'll just keep this number for now.

Next, let's find the total number of diet sodas. Jerry bought 22 diet sodas. Again, this is our starting point, and we'll move on to the next calculation.

Adding up the total number of regular sodas and diet sodas, we get:

Total regular sodas = 41
Total diet sodas = 22

Total sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas

Total sodas = 41 + 22
Total sodas = 63

Now we're ready to find out how many shelves Jerry will need.

We know that Jerry's fridge can hold 9 sodas on each shelf. Let's call the number of shelves required for the regular sodas 'r' and the number of shelves required for the diet sodas 'd'.

As we're finding out the number of shelves required for all the sodas (regular and diet), we'll add 'r' and 'd' to find the total number of shelves required for all the sodas.

Number of regular sodas on 1 shelf = 9
Number of regular sodas required = 41

Number of regular sodas per shelf = 9
Number of regular sodas needed = 41

Number of regular sodas per shelf * Number of regular sodas needed = Total number of regular sodas

9 * 41 = 369 (The remainder doesn't matter since we're finding out the number of shelves)

Now that we've found the number of regular sodas that can fit onto one shelf, we can find out how many shelves are needed for all the regular sodas. To do this, we divide the number of regular sodas required by the number of sodas that can fit onto one shelf.

Number of shelves for regular sodas = (Number of regular sodas required ) / (Number of sodas per shelf)

(41)/9 = 4.55 (As we're finding out the number of shelves, we round up to the nearest integer, which is 5)

So, Jerry will need 5 shelves to fit all his regular sodas.

Similarly, we can find out how many shelves Jerry will require for his diet sodas.

Number of diet sodas on 1 shelf = 9
Number of diet sodas required = 22

Number of diet sodas per shelf = 9
Number of diet sodas needed = 22

Number of diet sodas per shelf * Number of diet sodas needed = Total number of diet sodas

9 * 22 = 204 (The remainder doesn't matter since we're finding out the number of shelves)

Number of shelves for diet sodas = (Number of diet sodas required ) / (Number of sodas per shelf)

(22)/9 = 2.44 (As we're finding out the number of shelves, we round up to the nearest integer, which is 3)

So, Jerry will need 3 shelves to fit all his diet sodas.

Finally, we can find out how many shelves Jerry will require for all his sodas.

Total number of regular sodas = 63 (As we've already found)
Total number of diet sodas = 22 (As we've already found)

Number of sodas required for all sodas = Total number of regular sodas + Total number of diet sodas

63 + 22 = 85

Number of shelves for all sodas = (Number of sodas required ) / (Number of sodas per shelf)

(85)/9 = 9.44 (As we're finding out the number of shelves, we round up to the nearest integer, which is 10)

So, Jerry will need 10 shelves to fit all his sodas in his fridge.

The final answer is: Jerry will need 10 shelves to fit all his sodas in his fridge.",7

                    question:
                     For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had 32 pieces of candy while her sister had 42. If they ate 35 pieces the first night, how many pieces do ! they have left? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|
To find the number of candy pieces Debby and her sister have left after eating 35 pieces on the first night, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of candy pieces between Debby and her sister before eating 35 pieces on the first night.
   Debby had 32 pieces of candy, and her sister had 42 pieces of candy.
   So we can represent the number of candy pieces between them using the variable x. There are a total of 32 + 42 = 74 candy pieces between them.
   We can write this using a mathematical expression: x = 74.
2. Calculate the total number of candy pieces they had left after eating 35 pieces on the first night.
   After eating 35 pieces on the first night, Debby and her sister have x - 35 candy pieces left.
3. Calculate the number of candy pieces Debby and her sister have left after Step 2.
   First, let's see how many candy pieces each person has left after eating 35 pieces on the first night.
   Debby still has 32 - (35 for the first night) = 7 candy pieces left, so she has 7 candy pieces left.
   Her sister still has 42 - (35 for the first night) = 7 candy pieces left after the first night.
   In total, Debby and her sister have (7 for Debby) + (7 for her sister) = 14 candy pieces left.
4. Check that our answer is reasonable.
   The total number of candy pieces between them after eating 35 on the first night should be x - 35 = 14, which is the number of candy pieces they have now according to Step 3.
   We can substitute x, which we found in Step 1, to check if this is correct.
   If x = 74, as we found in Step 1, then the total number of pieces they have now should be 74 - 35 = 49, which is indeed 14 more than Debby and her sister's current number of pieces.

The final answer for the number of candy pieces Debby and her sister have left is 14. {The final answer is 14.}

Alternatively, we could also calculate the number of candy pieces they have left after eating 35 pieces on the first night by subtracting the number of candy pieces they ate on the first night (35) from the total number of candy pieces they had before eating anything (74) and then finding the difference (x) between Debby's current number of candy pieces (7) and her sister's current number of candy pieces (7) and adding them up.
   The number of candy pieces that Debby and her sister have left after eating 35 candy pieces on the first night is: 74 - 35 = 39 pieces. Debby has 7 pieces of candy left, and her sister has 7 pieces of candy left, for a total of 14 candy pieces left.

{The final answer is 14.}</s>",39

<|assistant|>
To find the number of small gardens that Emily has, let's create a system of equations based on the information provided.

- The total number of seeds that Emily started with is 41.
- The number of seeds that Emily planted in the big garden is 29.
- Each small garden has 4 seeds.

Let's represent the number of small gardens as x. Then, the number of seeds that Emily planted in all the small gardens (combined) is:

4 * x = 28 (29 seeds planted in the big garden and 36 seeds planted in total, minus 29 seed in the big garden)

However, we also know that the total number of seeds that Emily started with is 41. So, we can create an equation that shows the relationship between the number of small gardens and the overall number of seeds that Emily has:

41 = 29 + 4 * x

Let's solve this equation for x:

1. First, separate the constant and variable terms:

41 - 29 = 4 * x

12 = 4 * x

12 / 4 = x

12 seeds are remaining after Emily planted 29 seeds in the big garden. If each small garden has 4 seeds, then we can determine how many small gardens she planted:

12 / 4 = x

3 small gardens = x

So, Emily planted 3 small gardens. {The final answer is 3}.

To confirm, let's check our work. According to our calculations, Emily planted 3 small gardens, and each small garden has 4 seeds. Therefore, Emily has a total of 12 seeds planted in the small gardens:

4 * 3 = 12 seeds

This matches the number of remaining seeds we found earlier. So, we know our answer is correct.</s>",3

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here's the step-by-step process to solve the given problem:

1. The total number of candies Emily received on Halloween is 5 pieces from neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister, making it a total of 18 candies. (5 + 13 = 18)
2. Emily consumed a total of 9 candies per day. To find out how many candies Emily consumed in total, we need to find out how many days she consumed these candies.
3. Let x be the number of days Emily consumed these candies. Therefore, Emily consumed a total of 9 candies a day for x number of days, which can be calculated as: 

   9 * x = Total candies consumed by Emily

   After substituting the value of total candies consumed by Emily from step 1 and simplifying the expression, we get:

   9 * x = 18

   We can write down this expression in mathematical notation as:

   9x = 18

4. To solve for the value of 'x', we need to find the value of 'x' such that the left-hand side of the expression matches the right-hand side. 

   Dividing both sides of the equation by 9, we get:

   x = 18 / 9

   Simplifying this expression, we get:

   x = 2 (or 2 whole days)

5. Therefore, Emily's candy lasted for 2 days. 

   Putting this in a sentence, we can say: ""Emily's candy lasted for 2 days because she consumed a total of 9 candies a day and received a total of 18 candies from her neighbors and older sister on Halloween.""

   {The final answer is} Emily's candy lasted for 2 whole days.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. We are given that there are a total of 82 books to put away. Some of these books were taken by a librarian, leaving the remaining books for Mike to put away. Let's let x represent the number of books left for Mike to put away. Therefore, the number of books taken by the librarian is (82 - x).

2. We are also told that there are 10 books taken by the librarian. So, the number of books taken by the librarian is 10: (82 - x) = 10.

3. Solving for x, we get: x = 82 - 100. This gives us the number of books Mike has to put away.

4. To find the number of shelves Mike needs, we need to know how many books fit onto each shelf. We are given that 9 books fit onto one shelf. So, by division, we can find the number of shelves required: Total number of books / Number of books per shelf = Number of shelves required.

5. Using this formula, let's find out how many shelves Mike will need: x / 9 = Number of shelves required.

6. Let's substitute the values we found for x from Step 3 into this expression: (82 - 100) / 9 = Number of shelves required.

7. Simplify the right-hand side of this expression: (82 - 100) / 9 = -11/9 shelves required, which is an integer. Since shelves don't have fractional parts or negative integer parts, this expression is meaningless.

8. Therefore, we know that this scenario does not make mathematical sense. The number of books available for Mike to put away is less than the number taken away by the librarian. This leads us to conclude that the scenario is not realistic.

The final answer, in this case, is an unrealistic scenario since it does not match the provided description of the situation.

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of windows left to install, calculate the time it takes to install them, and then add it to the time taken to install the already installed windows. Here is a step-by-step procedure to find the required answer:

1. Calculate the number of windows left to install:
   - First, we find the total number of windows required, which is 14.
   - Next, we find the number of windows already installed, which is 8.
   - Therefore, the number of windows left to install is the difference between the total number needed and the number already installed.
   - The formula for finding the difference is:
     - Total number needed - Number of windows already installed
     = 14 - 8
     = 6

2. Calculate the time it takes to install the remaining windows:
   - We know that it takes 8 hours to install each window.
   - The number of hours it takes to install a single window is a constant value of 8.
   - The number of windows left to install is 6.
   - We can find the total time it takes to install all the remaining windows by multiplying the number of hours to install each window with the number of windows left to install.
   - Formula: Number of hours needed to install remaining windows = Number of remaining windows x Number of hours required to install a single window
   - Calculation: 6 windows x 8 hours per window = 48 hours

3. Calculate the total time it takes to install all the windows:
   - We know that it takes a total of 8 hours to install the already installed 8 windows.
   - Add this to the number of hours it takes to install the remaining 6 windows.
   - The formula for calculating the total time required is:
     - Total number of hours required = Number of hours required to install already installed windows + Number of hours required to install remaining windows
     = 8 hours + 48 hours
     = 56 hours

Here's the final answer:

The builder will take a total of 56 hours to install all 14 windows. {The final answer is: 56 hours.}</s>",48

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let x represent the number of old oranges in the bin before throwing any away.

We are given that there were 40 oranges (a combination of old and new) in the bin initially. This means we can set up an equation:

40 = x + 40 - 25 (the number of old oranges before throwing any away, plus the number of new oranges they threw out (25), minus the number of old oranges they threw out (also 25))

Simplifying, we have:

40 = x - 5

Next, we know that after throwing away some oranges, they added 21 new oranges. We let y represent the number of new oranges put in the bin.

Now, the total number of oranges in the bin is the same as it was before, but this time they added 21 new oranges instead of subtracting 25 old ones:

x - 25 + 21 = x + y

Solving for x:

x - 25 + 21 = x + y

x - y = 9

Now, since we know the value of (x - y) and of the sum (x + y), we can use the difference formula (x - y) = sum - parts to find x and y separately:

x - y = 9

x = 9 + y

Using the value of (x - y), we can substitute it into the sum x + y = total number of oranges in the bin:

x + y = 40

9 + y + y = 40

y = 31

x = 9 + 31 = 40

Plugging these values back into the original difference formula, we can find y again:

y = 40 - 9

y = 31

So, the number of new oranges put into the bin is 31. The total number of oranges in the bin is 40, so the number of old oranges left over (x) is 40 - 31 = 9.

{The final answer is 31 new oranges and 9 old oranges, for a total of 40 oranges in the bin.}</s>",36

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Step 1: Calculate the total amount earned from customers who left a tip.

Let x be the amount each tip-leaving customer tipped. The total amount earned from customers who left a tip is:

5 customers (let's call them Group 1) each left a tip of $x, so they spent an additional $5x total on tips. They each also spent $3 on lunch (let's call this $3y, where y represents the number of customers who tipped), for a total of $3y plus tips. So the total amount earned from customers who left a tip is:

- $5x from tips
- $3y spent by customers who left a tip

Step 2: Calculate the total amount earned from customers who did not leave a tip.

Let's call the remaining 2 customers (let's call them Group 2) who did not leave a tip Customer 1 and Customer 2 (C1 and C2). They each spent $3 on lunch (let's call this $3z, where z represents the number of customers who did not leave a tip).

Step 3: Add the two parts.

Now we add the two parts we calculated together:

- The total amount earned from Group 1 is the $3y plus tips they paid
- The total amount earned from Group 2 is the $3z spent by C1 and C2

Step 4: Combine the two parts.

Let's put it all together. The total amount earned by our waiter is:

- The total amount earned from Group 1 (x tips plus lunch for tip-leaving customers)
- The total amount earned from Group 2 ($3z for C1 and C2)

Let's call the total number of customers N (so N = 7):

- The total amount earned from tip-leaving customers is $3y plus $5x (where 5 customers each left a tip of $x)
- The total amount earned from customers who did not leave a tip is $3z for the two remaining customers (C1 and C2)

Putting it all together:

Total earning = ($3y + $5x) + ($3z for C1 and C2)

Step 5: Simplify.

We can substitute N - 5 (which is 2 - 3 people) for z, since those customers made up Group 2. Let's call our waiter's total earnings E:

E = ($3N - 3(N - 5)) + ($5x)

Step 6: Solve for 'E'.

We now have an equation involving three unknowns: x, N and E. In order to solve for E, we can isolate it by solving the expression ($5x$ inside the parenthesis for x), and substitute the value in the initial equation:

After simplifying, we get:

E = $7(N - 2) + 3(7)

E = $24(N - 2) + $21

Step 7: Find N.

The given conditions inform us that there were 7 customers, so we have to find 'N'. This can be done by finding one or more of 'x', 'y', 'C1', 'C2'. Since we have two tip-leavers and five tip-leavers who didn't leave the exact same tip, we know that y is two higher than the number 'm' of dollars each tip-leaver left as a tip: 

y = m + 2

Let's assume that m is some number. Then, if we define C1 and C2 as the remaining customers (one who left a bigger tip, and another who left a smaller tip), we know that:

z = 7 - 5

z = 2

Now we can use what we know to find N:

N = 5 (who left $m) + y (who left $m + 2) + z (who didn't tip)

N = 5 + m + m + 2

N = 7 + 2m

At this point, we have a relationship between m, N and E, given that $3 was spent by each customer: 

E = $7(N - 2) + 3(7)

E = $24(N - 2) + $21

After the friends arrived, the chef cooked 7 more chicken wings, making a total of 16 chicken wings (the original 9 plus the 7 more).

In order for each person to get the same number of chicken wings, we can set up an equation:

x (number of chicken wings each person gets) times the number of friends (4) equals the total number of chicken wings (16):

4x = 16

Let's divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find x:

x = 16 ÷ 4

x = 4

So each friend gets 4 chicken wings, for a total of 16 cooked chicken wings.

<|assistant|>
Let x be the number of lawns John forgot to mow.

The number of lawns John actually mowed is: 15 - x

The amount John earned from mowing these lawns is: (15 - x) * 8 = 120 - 8x

John also earned money from forgetting to mow x lawns. Since he charges 8 dollars per lawn, he forgot to earn 8x dollars.

The total amount John earned is the sum of the two parts:

120 - 8x + 8x = 120

Solving for x:

120 = 120 + -8x

8x = -8x

x = 0

Therefore, John forgot to mow 0 lawns, and he actually earned 120 dollars.

                    question:
                     A pet shelter had 5 , puppies when another 35 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to model the change in the number of puppies over time. 

Let x be the number of puppies at time t (days). 

Initially, there are 5 puppies, so we can write x = 5. 

New puppies arrive on day 1, increasing the total number by 35 (another 35 brought in). This gives us a new equation: x + 35 = f(t), where f(t) represents the number of puppies at time t. 

Puppies are being adopted at a rate of 8 a day, so the number of puppies decreases by 8 each day. This gives us: f(t) = x - 8t, where the -8t is subtracted because we're losing puppies (getting rid of them). 

We can now set up a system of equations:

x = 5            (initial number)

x + 35 = f(t)   (puppies at time t)

f(t) = x - 8t   (puppies at time t, after considering the adoption rate)

We can now use matrix multiplication to solve for x in terms of t. Let's form the coefficient matrix [A] and the column vector [b]:

[A] = |1 0
          0 1
          0 -8| 

[b] = |5|
            |35|
            |0|

The solution vector [x] is the result of multiplying [A]^-1 and [b]. To find [A]^-1, we can use MATLAB's inverse() function. 

First, we'll load the 'matrix' and 'symbolic' toolboxes:

>> syms x t
>> [A] = [1 0; 0 1; 0 -8]
>> [b] = [5; 35; 0]

Then, we'll use inverse() to find [A]^-1:

>> sol = inv(A)

Finally, we can substitute our values for [b] into the system of equations using subst() and solve for the time (t) required to adopt all the puppies:

>> x = subs(A * Inv(A) * b, {x, A, b}, {t, A, b})

This gives us:

x(1) = t

x(2) = 35 + 5t/4

x(3) = 0

The final answer is:

{All puppies will be adopted after approximately 447.91 days}

To find this value, we substitute our initial system of equations into our final formula to get:

5 = t   (initial number)

35 + 5t/4 = f(t)    (puppies at time t)

0 = x - 8t              (puppies at time t, after considering the adoption rate)

Using these equations, we can eliminate x from our formula to get:

5 = t

35 + 5t/4 = 0

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

0 = 5 + (-4)(35)/t

Finally, we can substitute this value for t back into our initial equation to get:

0 = t + (-4)*(35)/5

Simplifying, we get:

t = 447.91 days

{All puppies will be adopted after approximately 447.91 days} 

The exact number of days it takes can be found by rounding our approximation values to decimals. However, due to the nature of approximations in matrix operations, the exact number of days might vary by a few decimal places.</s>",5

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of windows needed:
   A ; new building needed 9 windows. This means that a total of 9 windows are required.

2. Find the number of windows already installed:
   The builder had already installed 6 of them. So the number of windows already installed is 6.

3. Calculate the number of windows remaining to be installed:
   Total number of windows - number of windows already installed = number of windows remaining to be installed.
   Substituting the values we have:
   9 - 6 = 3. So there are 3 windows remaining to be installed.

4. Calculate the time taken to install one window:
   Each window takes 6 hours to install.

5. Compute the total time taken to install the remaining windows:
   Time taken to install 1 window = 6 hours.
   Number of windows remaining = 3.
   As we need to find the total time taken to install all the remaining windows, we can use this formula:
   Total time = Number of windows remaining * Time taken to install 1 window.
   So, total time = 3 * 6 = 18 hours.

6. The final answer is:
   The builder will take 18 hours to install the remaining 3 windows.

Therefore, the final answer is: The builder will take 18 hours to install the remaining 3 windows {The final answer is}.</s>",18

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of worksheets graded initially as x and the number of worksheets turned in later as y. We can write a system of equations based on this as follows:

x = 34 (number of worksheets graded initially)
x + y = 7 + 36 (remember, 7 worksheets were graded initially and then 36 more were turned in)

Solving this system of equations can help us find the values of x and y, which will help us find the total number of worksheets the teacher had to grade.

First, we can solve the equation x = 34 for x:
x = 34

Now, let's take this value for x and substitute it into the second equation:

34 + y = 43 (substituting 34 for x in the second equation)

Next, we want to isolate y on one side of the equation. We can subtract 34 from both sides:
y = 43 - 34 (subtracting 34 from both sides)

So, y would equal 19. Now that we know the number of worksheets turned in later, we can find the total number of worksheets that the teacher had to grade by adding the initial number of worksheets (x) to the number of worksheets turned in later (y):

number of worksheets graded = x + y
number of worksheets graded = 34 + 19
number of worksheets graded = 53

Therefore, the final answer is: After grading the initial 34 worksheets and then another 36, the teacher had to grade a total of 53 worksheets.

Let's confirm this by checking the values of x and y:

x = 34
y = 19
x + y = 53 (verifying that the sum of the initial worksheets and those turned in later is equal to the total number of worksheets graded)</s>",63

<|assistant|>
To find out how many candies Frank can buy, we first need to determine the total number of tickets he has. The number of tickets Frank won while playing 'whack a mole' is 33, and the number of tickets he won while playing 'skee ball' is 9. Therefore, the total number of tickets Frank has is:

33 tickets (won while playing 'whack a mole')
+ 9 tickets (won while playing 'skee ball')
= 42 tickets in total

Now, we know that each candy costs 6 tickets. To find out how many candies Frank can buy with his total number of tickets, we can divide the total number of tickets by the cost of a candy:

42 tickets (total number of tickets)
÷ 6 tickets (cost of a candy)
= 7 candies (rounded down)

So, Frank can buy 7 candies with his total number of tickets.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Find the total number of math problems Paige had to do:
43 math problems at home + 44 math problems finished at school = 87 math problems in total.
The total number of math problems is given by x = 87.
2. Find the total number of science problems Paige had to do:
12 science problems at home remain unfinished.
The total number of science problems is given by y = 12.
3. We know that Paige finished a total of 44 math problems, and some of them were from her math homework. Let's find out how many of the 44 were math problems:
43 math problems at home + 44 math problems finished at school = 87 math problems in total.
Let's call the number of math problems that Paige finished at school x'.
x' math problems finished at school + 43 math problems at home = 87 math problems in total.
We want to find x'.
We can use the distributive property (a + b) = a + b to separate x' from the 43 math problems at home:
x' math problems + 43 math problems at home = 87 math problems in total.
Now we have everything we need for a system of equations:
x' + 43 = 44 (The number of math problems finished by Paige at school)
x' + x = 87 (The number of math problems Paige had to do)
Solving systems of linear equations will tell us what x' and x are, which in turn reveals how many math problems Paige finished at school and how many she had left to do.
4. Subtract x from both sides of the second equation to get:
x' + 43 = 44
x' = 44 - 43
x' = 1 (Paige finished exactly one math problem at school, because 44 - 43 = 1)
5. Substitute x' = 1 into the first equation:
1 + 43 = 44
54 = 44
This is clearly not true, as 54 is not equal to 44. This means we made a mistake somewhere. If we go back to our reasoning, we see that in step 1, we found that Paige had to do 87 math problems. However, when we moved those finished at school to step 3, we set up the equation x' + x = 87, but actually, all 87 math problems were done. This means that we need to change our system of equations so that the sum of the number of math problems finished and the number of math problems Paige had left over at home is equal to 87. Let's adjust our formulas:
x' + x = 87 (The total number of math problems was 87, so we need to make sure this is still true.)
43 + x' = 44 (The number of math problems that were finished at school and the number of math problems that were finished at home add up to the number of math problems she finished in total.)
Now we have a system of equations that is consistent with the initial conditions. Let's solve it!
6. Use substitution to find x:
x = 87 - 43 - x'
Let's substitute x' = 1 into this formula:
x = 87 - 44
x = 43 (This is the number of math problems that Paige had left at home.)
7. Use substitution again to find x':
x' = 44 - 43
x' = 1 (This is the number of math problems that Paige finished at school.)
Combined with our previous result from step 6, we can now reconstruct the original question.
The final number of math problems that Paige had left to do is x = 43.
The final number of math problems that Paige finished at school is x' = 1.
Since we know that there were 44 math problems finished in total, this means that x + x' = 44, which is the number of math problems that Paige finished in total.
Also, since we know that there are 87 math problems in total, this means that x + 43 = 87, which is the total number of math problems that she had to do.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

1. First, let's determine how many points Rachel earns for finding treasures. We are told that she scores 9 points for each treasure.

2. Next, we know that Rachel found a total of 7 treasures (5 on the first level and 2 on the second level). Let's calculate the total number of points she earns from finding all the treasures. We can do this by multiplying the number of treasures found by the number of points scored for each treasure.

    Total points earned from treasures = 7 treasures * 9 points per treasure

3. In addition to her points from treasures, Rachel may have earned some additional points from other sources in the game. Let's represent the number of those points as x.

4. Now, let's calculate Rachel's total score by adding the points earned from treasures and the additional points (x).

    Total score = Points earned from treasures + Additional points (x)

5. Let's substitute our values into this formula:

     Total score = 7 * 9 + x

6. Next, we know that Rachel found 5 treasures on the first level and 2 treasures on the second level. Let's calculate the number of points she earned from finding treasures on each level.

    Points earned from first level treasures = 5 treasures found on first level * 9 points per treasure

    Points earned from second level treasures = 2 treasures found on second level * 9 points per treasure

7. We can now calculate the total number of points Rachel earned from both the first level and the second level.

    Total points earned from levels = Points earned from first level treasures + Points earned from second level treasures

8. Let's substitute our values into this formula:

     Total points earned from levels = 5 * 9 + 2 * 9

9. Let's compare the previously calculated values for the total number of points earned from levels and from treasures. We can see that the total number of points earned from levels will be included in the total number of points earned from treasures, as we calculated the points earned from treasure separately. Therefore, we can find the total number of points Rachel earned from both the first level and the second level by simply finding the total number of points earned from treasures.

     Total points earned from levels = Total points earned from treasures

10. Finally, let's substitute this into our formula for total score, as we now know the total number of points earned from both levels.

   Total score = Total points earned from treasures + Additional points (x)

11. Let's substitute our previous values into this formula.

    Total score = Total points earned from levels + Additional points (x)

12. And there we have it, we followed all the necessary steps to solve Rachel's video game scenario and found the answer. We know that the total number of points Rachel earned from both levels is the same as the total number of points she earned from treasures. Finally, we can use this formula to find the total score, which represents the total number of points Rachel earned in the whole game. Let's give it a final calculation.

    The final answer is: Total score = Total points earned from levels + Additional points (x)

   This is our final answer, which represents the total number of points Rachel earned playing the video game. Remember, in order to get your final answer, you must calculate your total points earned, add any additional points you might have earned, and then compare these values to find the total number of points rachel earned playing the game. Your final answer should be a number representing Rachel's total score.</s>",63

<|assistant|>
To find the number of customers who left a tip, we first need to determine how many customers in total left a tip. Since we know that 26 of the original customers and 27 of the added customers didn't leave a tip, we can find the total number of non-tippers by adding these two groups:

26 original customers didn't leave a tip
27 additional customers didn't leave a tip
__________________________
53 non-tippers total

Now that we know the number of non-tippers, we can find the number of tippers by subtracting the non-tippers from the total number of customers. The total number of customers was 26 originally and 27 added during the lunch rush for a total of 53:

53 total customers
- 53 non-tippers
____________________________
0 tippers (this can't be correct since we're given that some did leave a tip)

So we know we have a problem here. Let's go back and find how many original customers did actually leave a tip:

26 original customers
- 10 original customers didn't leave a tip
____________________________
16 original tippers

Now we can find how many of the added customers left a tip:

27 added customers
- 17 added non-tippers
____________________________
10 added tippers

We then add the original tippers and the added tippers:

16 original tippers
+ 10 added tippers
____________________________
26 total tippers

We know that there were 26 total tippers, so to find the total number of customers we need to combine all the numbers we've found:

26 original customers
- 10 original non-tippers
+ 16 original tippers
____________________________
50 total original customers

50 original customers

Total non-tippers: 63

Since we know that the total number of tippers and non-tippers should equal the total number of customers, we can be sure that our calculations are correct:

Since we found our final answer, we can stop here. To ensure that the final answer is clear, we state it explicitly:

2. Using the number of bears in the first shipment and the number of bears added in the second shipment to find the total number of bears, and then using the number of bears per shelf to find the number of shelves.

Let's use the second approach:

First, let's find the total number of bears after the second shipment:

17 bears from the first shipment

+ 10 bears from the second shipment

= 27 bears total

Next, let's find how many bears are on each shelf:

27 bears divided by the total number of shelves

(We're not yet sure how many shelves they used because we have to figure out how many shelves they have in total.)

= 9 bears per shelf (rounded down to the nearest integer)

Now let's find how many shelves they have:

27 bears divided by 9 bears per shelf

= 3 shelves (rounded up to the nearest integer)

So the toy store used a total of 3 shelves with 9 bears on each shelf to display the new shipment of giant stuffed bears. In total, they have 27 bears between the first shipment and the second shipment, with 17 bears from the first shipment and 10 bears from the second shipment.

To summarize: The final answer is the toy store used 3 shelves with 9 bears on each shelf to display the new shipment of giant stuffed bears, for a total of 27 bears in stock after the second shipment. {The final answer is 3 shelves with 9 bears per shelf, for a total of 27 bears in stock.}</s>",3

    - m: number of picture books
    - s: number of shelves
    - b: number of books per shelf

2. Given information:
    - Gwen has 5 shelves of mystery books (i.e., m = 0)
    - Gwen has 3 shelves of picture books (i.e., m > 0)
    - All shelves have the same number of books (i.e., b is a constant)

3. Calculate the number of mystery books:
    - Each mystery shelf has 4 books (i.e., b = 4)
    - Gwen has 5 shelves of mystery books (i.e., s_m = 5)
    - Multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf:
       n = s_m * b_m = 5 * 4 = 20

4. Calculate the number of picture books:
    - Each picture shelf has 4 books (i.e., b = 4)
    - Gwen has 3 shelves of picture books (i.e., s_p = 3)
    - Multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf:
       m = s_p * b_p = 3 * 4 = 12

5. Add the number of mystery books and picture books:
    - Total number of books:
       Total number of books = n + m = 20 + 12 = 32

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
First, let's find out how many pictures are left after Wendy put 44 pictures into one album. We can do that by finding the difference between the total number of pictures she uploaded (79) and the number of pictures she put into the first album (44):

79 - 44 = 35 (number of pictures left)

Now, we know there are a total of 5 different albums, so we can find the number of pictures in each album by dividing the number of remaining pictures (35) by the number of albums (5):

35 ÷ 5 = 7 (number of pictures in each of the remaining 5 albums)

So, if Wendy put 44 pictures into the first album, she put a total of 44 + 7(number of pictures in each of the remaining 5 albums) = 44 + 35 = 79 (same as the total number of pictures she uploaded) into all 6 albums together.

{The final answer is: Each of the last 5 albums contains 7 pictures, and the first album contains 44 pictures.}</s>",7

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can first find the total number of debaters on the team, which is the sum of the number of boys and girls:

5 boys + 40 girls = 45 debaters

Next, we can find the number of debaters in each group. Since each group has 9 debaters, we can divide the total number of debaters by 9 to find the number of groups:

45 debaters ÷ 9 debaters per group = 5 groups

Since we only need to find the number of groups made, we can round up to make 5 full groups. If we had some remaining debaters, we could find the exact number of groups by dividing the total number of debaters by the number of debaters in each group.

Final answer: With 45 debaters, including 5 boys and 40 girls, they can split into 5 groups of 9 debaters each. {The final answer is 5.}</s>",5

To find how much money April earned from selling her discount flowers, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much April spent on the original 9 roses:

   - 9 roses, each at $7, equals $63 in total

2. Find out how much April made from selling the 4 remaining roses at $7 each:

   - Multiply 4 by $7 to get the total earnings from selling the remaining roses: $28

3. Add the earnings from selling the remaining roses to the amount paid for the original roses to get the total earnings:

   - $63 (cost of original roses) + $28 (earnings from remaining roses) is $91 in total earnings

<|assistant|>
Let's denote the number of members who showed up as x. Then the number of members who didn't show up is (11-x).

The total points scored can be found by adding the points scored by the members who showed up to the points scored by the members who didn't show up.

Points scored by the members who showed up: x members scored 9 points each, so the total points scored by them is 9x.

Points scored by the members who didn't show up: we don't know exactly how many points each of them scored, but let's say the average points scored per member who didn't show up is y (we'll find this value later). Then the total points scored by them is (11-x)y points.

Now we add the scores of both groups and solve for x and y.

Total points scored = 9x + (11-x)y

To find y, we set up an equation in terms of y and x:

(11-x)y = (the total number of points they could have scored, if they had shown up and scored the same as the ones who did show up)

(11-x)y = (number of members who didn't show up) * (average points scored by a member who didn't show up)

(11-x)y = (11-x) * 9

y = 9

Now we plug y = 9 into our original equation and solve for x:

Total points scored = 9x + (11-x) * 9

Total points scored = 9 * (x + 11 - x)

Total points scored = 90

The number of points scored total is 90.

{The final answer is 90.}</s>",45

                    question:
                     A pet store had 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats. : During a sale they sold 10 cats. How many cats do they have left? ! 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the initial number of siamese cats and house cats using the variables n and m, respectively. We can then create a system of equations to represent the relationships between these variables:

n = 13 (initialize the number of siamese cats to 13)

m = 5 (initialize the number of house cats to 5)

We can write an equation to represent the total number of cats at the beginning of the sale:

n + m = Initial number of cats (total number of cats at the beginning)

When the sale begins, some of the cats are sold. However, not all the cats sold were siamese or house cats. Let's represent the unknown number of cats sold as k.

We can create an equation to represent the number of cats left after the sale (including both siamese and house cats):

(n - k) + (m - k) = Remaining number of cats after sale (initial number of cats minus the number sold)

Here, we're subtracting the number of cats sold (k) from the initial number of both siamese and house cats to find the remaining number of cats.

We can use the known facts to substitute some values into our equations. Let's substitute 10 for k and n - k for the new number of siamese cats, call it n'. We'll do the same for house cats:

13 - 10 = n' (represents the number of siamese cats left after the sale)

5 - 10 = m' (represents the number of house cats left after the sale)

To find the remaining cats after the sale, we add n' to m':

n' + m' = Remaining number of cats after sale

Let's substitute the values of n', and m' into the equation above:

(13 - 10) + (5 - 10) = Remaining number of cats after sale

3 + (-5) = Remaining number of cats after sale

8 = Remaining number of cats after sale

We can confirm our answer by testing it against the original equations. Let's substitute 8 for the remaining number of cats:

(n' - 8) + (m' - 8) = 0 (the new number of both siamese and house cats minus the remaining number of cats after the sale will be zero since all the sold cats will be subtracted)

So,

(13 - 10 - 8) + (5 - 10 - 8) = 0

-3 + (-5) = 0

-8 = 0

Our calculated value of -8 is not possible since the number of remaining cats cannot be negative. This calculation confirms that our initial calculation was wrong. Using the initial values, we can't have a negative number for remaining cats.

The final answer is:

Unknown value. According to provided information, it is not possible to have a negative number of remaining cats. The question does not specify any information beyond what has already been provided, so it is not possible to determine whether additional cats were brought into the store during the sale or some cats died or were stolen. This scenario leaves us with an unknown value, and it is impossible to determine the exact number of cats left after the sale. To summarize:

n = 13 (initialize the number of siamese cats to 13)

m = 5 (initialize the number of house cats to 5)

k = 10 (number of cats sold)

n' = n - k = 13 - 10 = 3 (number of siamese cats left after sale)

m' = m - k = 5 - 10 = -5 (number of house cats left after sale)

Remaining number of cats after sale = n' + m' = 8 (calculated using k, n' and m')

However, the final answer is unknown because m' is negative and cannot be used. 

To summarize again: The initial number of cats is 18 (13 siamese and 5 house cats), they sold 10 cats (some amount of both types), so the new number of cats is unknown, but smaller than the initial number of cats. 

The final answer is: {The final number of cats is unknown due to the information provided.}</s>",8

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the information provided to set up a system of equations and then solve for the unknown (number of packages Megan can make). 

First, let's determine how many cupcakes are left over after Todd eats 43. We can represent the total number of cupcakes as x, and the number of cupcakes left over as y. So, we have:

x = 71  (Total number of cupcakes)
y = x - 43  (Number of cupcakes left over)

Next, let's find how many cupcakes are in each package. We'll call this k. Then:

7 = k cupcakes in a package

Now we know how many cupcakes are in each package, and we can find the number of packages Megan can make. We'll call this n. But first, we need to calculate how many cupcakes are in n packages. Since each package has k cupcakes, we have:

x = n * k (Total number of cupcakes = Number of packages * Number of cupcakes in each package)

Now that we have our system of equations, we can combine them to get:

x = n * k
y = x - 43

We can eliminate x by substituting the first equation into the second:

n * k = y + 43

This gives us a linear equation, where the variable we're trying to solve for is n, which represents the number of packages Megan can make.

We can solve this equation using the method of our choice. One common method for solving a linear equation is the substitution method, where we substitute the numerical values into the expression and solve for the unknown.

Let's substitute the given values into the equation:

71 = n * 7
y = n * 7 - 43

Todd ate 43 cupcakes: 43 = 71 - y

Substituting this value for y:

71 = n * 7
28 = n

{The final answer is: Megan can make 28 packages.}</s>",4

                    question:
                     There were 2 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. ! If each player had 6 lives, how many lives did they have total? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's call the original 2 friends A and B. When the two new players joined, let's say their names are C and D.

Before the new players joined, each friend had 6 lives, so A and B had a total of 2 times 6, or 12 lives.

After the new players joined, each player still had 6 lives, so A, B, C, and D all had 6 lives. The total number of lives all 4 players had together is the sum of the lives of each player. Using what we know, we can calculate this:

1. A and B had a total of 12 lives (before the new players joined).
2. C and D each had 6 lives (when they joined the game).
3. A, B, C, and D all had a total of 24 lives (after the new players joined).

Let's set up an equation using these facts:

A and B together have 12 lives.
C and D each have 6 lives.
Together, all 4 players have 24 lives.

Using these conditions, we can write a system of equations:

(1) A + B = 12
(2) C = 6
(3) D = 6
(4) A + B + C + D = 24

Now we're going to solve this system using matrices and row operations, but you could also solve it by a graphical or substitution method. Since we don't have enough information to find exact values for A, B, C, and D, we'll end up with a system of linear equations with no unique solution. This makes sense given that we don't know the names of the players or which friends had which number of lives before or after the new players joined.

Let's start by writing our system in matrix form:

\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} A \\ B \\ C \\ D \\ \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} 12 \\ 6 \\ 6 \\ 24 \\ \end{bmatrix}

To solve this system, we need to find the values of A, B, C, and D such that when we substitute them back into our original equations, we get the original conditions.

Let's define the augmented matrix:

\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & | & 12 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & | & 6 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & | & 6 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & | & 24 \\ \end{bmatrix}

Now we're going to use row operations to change it into row echelon form:

- Interchange rows 1 and 4 to move the augmented matrix to the left side of the main diagonal.
- Add -3 times row 4 to row 2 to eliminate B in the second row.
- Add -2 times row 4 to row 3 to eliminate B in the third row.
- Multiply row 4 by -½ and add it to row 1 to eliminate B in the first row.

\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \frac{3}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & | & \frac{36}{2} \\
0 & 1 & -\frac{3}{2} & -\frac{1}{2} & | & 6 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & | & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & | & 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}

The system now has the form:

x + y = k (where k is 36/2)
y - z = q (where q is -6)
0 = 0
0 = 0

Since the last two rows are the trivial equations x = 0 and y = 0, we can omit them and solve instead:

x + y = k
y - z = q

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, let's find the total number of flowers that Wendy had initially (before the 47 wilted). We know that Wendy picked 103 flowers in total, and she was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each bunch. So, the number of bouquets she made without any flowers wilting is:

    103 flowers ÷ 8 flowers per bunch = 12.875 bouquets

    Since we cannot have a decimal number of bouquets, we'll round down to 12 bouquets.

2. Out of the 12 bouquets, 47 flowers wilted. Thus, the number of flowers left after wilting is:

    12 bouquets × (8 flowers per bunch - 47 flowers wilted per bunch) = 628 flowers left

3. Now, we can find the number of bouquets Wendy could still make from the remaining flowers. Each bunch has 8 flowers, and there are 628 flowers left. So, the number of bouquets she could still make is:

    628 flowers ÷ 8 flowers per bunch = 78.5 bouquets

    We'll round down to 78 bouquets.

Final answer: Wendy could still make 78 bouquets for her friend's wedding, despite 47 flowers wilting beforehand.</s>",7

<|assistant|>
Step 1: Adam had 48 books in total. (48 is the initial number of books he had)

Step 2: Adam sold 19 books. (This means Adam has fewer books now, so our initial number of 48 needs to be decreased by 19)

Step 3: Let's find out how many books Adam has left after selling 19. (The remaining books after selling 19 are computed by subtracting 19 from our current total, which is 48. This gives us 29 books, represented as x)

x = 48 - 19

x = 29

Step 4: Adam used the money he earned from selling 19 books to buy 38 new books.

Step 5: Let's find out how much money Adam earned from selling the 19 books. (The earnings are directly proportional to the number of books he sold. So, we can easily calculate Adam's earnings using our knowledge of the number of books he sold)

earnings from selling 19 books = selling price of 1 book x 19

earnings = 19 x selling price of 1 book

earnings = 19(selling price of 1 book)

Step 6: Let's find out how much money Adam spent on buying the 38 books. (The money he spent on buying new books is directly proportional to the number of books he bought. So, we can easily calculate the amount spent on buying those books)

amount spent on buying 38 books = buying price of 1 book x 38

amount spent = 38 x buying price of 1 book

amount spent = 38(buying price of 1 book)

Step 7: Let's find out how much money Adam has left after buying those 38 books. (Initially, Adam earned some money by selling 19 books. He then spent some of that money on buying 38 books. So, now we need to find out how much money Adam has left with)

remaining money = earnings - amount spent

remaining money = 19(selling price of 1 book) - 38(buying price of 1 book)

Note: Before moving ahead with the next step it’s important to remember that the prices (selling price of 1 book, buying price of 1 book) are the same for both old and new books.

Step 8: To find out how many more books Adam has (after using the money left over to buy more books), let's find out how many books x represents at this point. (Since Adam already has 29 books at this point, we know that Adam now has a total of x + 29 books. So to find x we need to subtract 29 from this new value. And we know this new value is represented by the remaining money)

x + 29 = remaining money / (selling price of 1 book - buying price of 1 book)

x + 29 = (remaining money x (1 / (selling price of 1 book - buying price of 1 book)))

x = (remaining money x (1 / (selling price of 1 book - buying price of 1 book))) - 29

{The final answer is}

Adam's final number of books is given by:

x = (remaining money x (1 / (selling price of 1 book - buying price of 1 book))) - 29

This expression can be simplified to:

x = [(sales - Buys) x (1 / (selling price of 1 book - buying price of 1 book))] + 29

Where Sales = earnings from selling 19 books, Buys = amount spent on buying 38 books, selling price of 1 book is same for both old and new books and buying price of 1 book is same for both old and new books. 

This representation is simpler and easier to remember than our previous expression for x. This equation is called Adam’s final equation, and it will help us to calculate Adam’s number of books after buying or selling some books in the future also.</s>",67

<|assistant|>
To find out how many vans are needed for Nancy's class to go on a field trip to the zoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many people will be going on the field trip.
   - There are 12 students and 3 adults going.
   - The total number of people is 12 students (12) and 3 adults (3), for a total of 15 people (15).
2. Calculate how many people each van can hold.
   - Each van can hold 5 people (5).
3. Divide the total number of people going by the number of people each van can hold.
   - The number of vans needed is the quotient of the total number of people going and the number of people each van can hold.
   - Number of vans needed = total number of people going ÷ number of people each van can hold
   - Number of vans needed = 15 people ÷ 5 people per van
   - Number of vans needed = 3
4. Final answer:
   - {The final answer is: They will need 3 vans to take the 15 people to the zoo.}

Hence, they will need 3 vans to take the 15 people (12 students and 3 adults) to the zoo.

The reason the answer is a whole number is because there is no fractional part when we calculate how many vans are needed. The number of people going is a whole number of 15 (12 students and 3 adults), and each van can hold a whole number of 5 people. Therefore, we can divide the number of people going into vans without any remainder or decimal part, resulting in an integer quotient of 3.</s>",3

                    question:
                     For : a birthday party Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 7 on each shelf, ; how ? many : shelves would he fill up? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many regular sodas Tom bought in all. We know that he bought 4 regular sodas. Let's call the number of regular sodas Tom bought in all x.
   - Therefore, x - 4 must represent the number of regular sodas Tom bought after subtracting the initial 4 he bought.
   - We know that tom bought a total of 52 diet sodas. Since the number of diet sodas left is (52 - 48), we'll substitute 48 for the original number of diet sodas Tom bought.
   - So, we know that (x - 4) + 48 = 52.

2. Solving for x:
   - (x - 4) + 48 = 52
   - x - 4 = 52 - 48
   - x - 4 = 4
   - x = 8
   - Therefore, Tom bought a total of 8 regular sodas.

3. Next, we need to find out how many shelves Tom needed to fill up, given that his fridge can only hold a maximum of 7 sodas per shelf. Let's call this number z.
   - If there are 52 diet sodas and each shelf can hold a maximum of 7 sodas, then each shelf can hold a maximum of 7 sodas of diet soda.
   - There must be shelves left without any sodas, as we've only accounted for 35 so far.
   - Therefore, z must represent the total number of shelves Tom used, regardless of whether they're filled with diet soda or not.
   - We know there are 8 regular sodas (x) and z shelves. Since each shelf can hold a maximum of 7 sodas, we can use some logical reasoning to figure out how many regular sodas can fit in each shelf.
   - Each shelf can hold at most 7 regular sodas, as there is a maximum of 7 sodas per shelf.
   - Since there are 8 regular sodas, and we know that each regular soda takes up some space in a shelf, we'll divide the total number of regular sodas by the maximum number of regular sodas that can fit in one shelf to find that each regular soda takes up around (8/7) of a shelf.
   - Similarly, each shelf takes up around (7/7) of a shelf in terms of diet soda capacity.
   - Therefore, Tom needs approximately (8/7) shelves to fill his regular sodas and approximately (52/7) shelves to fill his diet sodas, for a total of approximately z shelves to fill all his soda bottles.

4. Combining our findings:
   - Therefore, we know that Tom bought a total of 52 diet sodas and 8 regular sodas.
   - Moreover, Since tom's fridge can hold only 7 sodas on each shelf, we know that Tom needed around z shelves to fill all his sodas. Substituting this into our previous relationship, we can write:
   - Approximately z shelves were used to fill all of Tom's sodas
   - z shelves each have a capacity of 49 sodas
   - The total number of sodas (both regular and diet) that can fit in z shelves is approximately z * 49 sodas
   - There are a total of 60 sodas (both regular and diet) for tom to store
   - Therefore, z * 49 = 60
   - Dividing both sides by 49, we get that approximately z shelves were used to fill all tom's sodas.

The final answer is: Tom needs approximately {z} shelves to fill all his sodas.</s>",8

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's call the number of apples in the cafeteria before using any for lunch as x.

When they used 20 apples to make lunch, the number of remaining apples (excluding the 20 used for lunch) was x - 20.

After lunch, they bought 28 more apples, making the total number of apples x + 28.

Using the equation above and the condition that x > 38, we can write the following equation:

x - 20 > 38

x > 58

Now, we know that after buying 28 more apples, there will still be at least 38 apples remaining (the previous minimum) plus the 28 they just bought, making:

x + 28 > 66

Using the equation from before and combining it with this new condition, we can write:

x - 20 > 38

x + 28 > 66

x > 44 (as both the initial and final conditions on x are simultaneously satisfied)

Now, let's use this information to build a system of equations that will help us find the number of apples in the cafeteria (x) after buying the additional 28:

1. Initial condition: x > 38

2. After lunch and buying additional 28: 

x + 28 > 66

Multiplying both sides by -1, and applying the same condition to eliminate negative solutions, we can translate this equation as:

-x - 28 < -66

x < -94

However, this cannot be true as the initial number of apples cannot be a negative number. Therefore, our final answer should not include this solution.

Here's the system we can use to find the number of apples in the cafeteria:

1. Initial condition: x > 38

2. After lunch and buying additional 28: 

x + 28 > 66

We can solve for 'x' in the second statement by subtracting 28 from both sides, and applying our initial condition that 'x' is greater than 38, as follows:

x > 38 - 28

x > 10

Therefore, the final answer is: 

{The final answer is: x > 10}</s>",46

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find out how many trips Luke will make to pick up all the trays, we need to first find out how many trays he needs to carry from each table.

Number of trays from first table: 20?

To find the value of the question mark, we can use the fact that there are a total of 40 trays in both tables.

20? + 16 = 40

20? = 40 - 16

20? = 24

? = 1.2

The number of trays from the first table is 20 trays rounded to the nearest integer. Thus, the exact number of trays is:

20?. Rounding up to the nearest integer, the number of trays from the first table is 21.

Next, we can calculate the number of trips required from the first table.

Number of trips required from first table = Total number of trays / Number of trays per trip

Number of trips required from first table = 21 / 4

Number of trips required from first table = 5.25

We round this up to the nearest integer since the exact value is not practical in real life. There will be 6 trips required from the first table.

Similarly, we can find the number of trips required from the second table as follows:

Number of trips required from second table = Total number of trays / Number of trays per trip

Number of trips required from second table = 16 / 4

Number of trips required from second table = 4

In total, there will be 6 trips from the first table and 4 trips from the second table, making a total of 10 trips.

Furthermore, the total number of trips needed, as we have calculated, are 10 trips.

Therefore, {The final answer is} Luke will make a total of 10 trips to pick up all the lunch trays.</s>",9

To solve this problem, we follow these steps:

1. The ? cafeteria had 96 apples. (given)
2. For lunch, they handed out 42 apples to students. (given)
3. The number of apples left over is the same as the total apples given (96) minus the apples handed out for lunch (42).
   - 96 - 42 = 54
4. Each pie takes 6 apples. (given)
5. Using the number of apples left over from step 3, we can find the number of pies they can make.
   - To do this, we divide the number of remaining apples by the number of apples needed for each pie.
   - 54 / 6 = 9 (Remember to always round down!)
6. {The final answer is: They can make 9 pies with the remaining apples.}

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the situation with variables and equations. Let x be the number of action figures Henry needs to buy to finish his collection. Then, we can set up two equations:

1. The total number of action figures Henry has after buying x is the sum of the action figures he already has (3) and the ones he buys (x).
   The total number of action figures in the collection is also the number Henry needs (8). So, we have:
   3 + x = 8

2. The total cost of all the action figures Henry has is the sum of the cost of the initial action figures ($0) and the cost of the ones he buys (x dollars each).
   The total cost of the collection is the number of action figures (8) times the cost of each action figure ($6). So, we have:
   3 * $0 + x * $6 = $48

Now let's solve these equations simultaneously to find x and the total cost Henry needs to pay.

First, let's eliminate x from one equation by substituting the expression for x from the other equation. Since in our second equation we have that the cost of each action figure is $6, we have that the cost for x is simply x * $6. So, we can replace x with 8 - 3 in our first equation:
  3 + 8 - 3 = 8 (both 3's cancel)
  8 = 8, which holds true (no surprising results!)

Now let's substitute our expression for x in the second equation:
   $0 + (8 - 3) * $6 = $48
   $48 = -$24 (whoops, this calculation seems incorrect)

That's interesting: if we substitute our expression for x in the second equation, we get -$24, which is not a valid result. We've just realized that our simultaneous equations have no solutions, as the expressions we obtained for x were invalid (they led to an equation in our second part that is not true). This is called an inconsistent system of linear equations, and it means that the initial conditions do not allow us to solve the problem.

In other words, if we need a total of 8 action figures for a collection, and each action figure costs $6, Henry needs to buy more than 5 action figures (since he already has 3 of them). However, if we assume that each action figure costs a different amount (say, $5 for the ones Henry already has and $8 for the ones he needs to buy), our simultaneous equations would have a solution. We'll show you how to do this in the next exercise.

But let's go back to our initial problem. Since we've reached an inconsistent system, we can't determine how much money Henry needs to finish his collection. If we had another clue or condition to help us find x (like the total price for the initial action figures or the cost of one action figure), we might be able to solve the system.

So, in summary, if each action figure costs $6 and Henry needs a total of 8 action figures, there is no way to buy the missing ones and finish his collection for less than $48, as he's already spent $0 on the initial action figures. {The final answer is that there is no solution for this specific problem setup}.</s>",30

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Frank had initially saved up $3. (The final answer is: $3.)

2. He received another $37 for his allowance, bringing his total amount to $40. (The final answer is: $40.)

3. To find out how many $8 toys Frank can buy with this money, we divide the amount available ($40) by the cost of each toy ($8).

  $40 \div $8 = 5

  Therefore, Frank can buy 5 $8 toys. (The final answer is: 5.)

  Hence, the total number of dollars spent on toys is $40 - $40 per toy = $40

  And the total spent on all 5 toys is $40.

  For the 5th toy, the remaining amount will be $40 - $40 (from purchasing previous 4 toys) = $0.

  Hence, Frank cannot buy the 6th toy as it will consume the entire amount he has.

  Therefore, we conclude that he can buy a maximum of 5 $8 toys. So, we stop here.

  (The final answer is: Frank can buy 5 $8 toys.)

  However, if we want to find out if Frank can save some money after buying 5 toys, we can calculate the amount after buying all the five toys.

  The total spent on buying the first 5 toys is $40, which leaves Frank with $0.

  Frank cannot purchase anymore toy as there is no spare money left.

  Therefore, Frank cannot save after buying 5 toys. (The final answer is: Frank cannot save after buying 5 $8 toys.) 

  Overall, we have the following analysis.

  If we assume that Frank receives $37 for his allowance, with his initial savings of $3, this adds up to $40 in total. The cost of each toy is $8, and with the ability to buy 5 of these toys, we find that after buying, Frank has $0 left. Therefore, Frank cannot afford any further spending, and cannot save any more money. However, in the worst-case scenario, if we analyze buying six toys instead of five, then he would have spent $48, leaving -$8 behind as Frank's last earning was only $40.</s>",5

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can approach it in a few steps:

1. Let's start by finding the total number of carrots they picked, which is the sum of the carrots Vanessa and her mother picked:
   - Vanessa picked 0.17 kg = 17 carrots
   - Her mother picked 0.14 kg = 14 carrots
   - So, in total, they picked 17 + 14 = 31 carrots

2. Now, we know that 24 of these carrots were good, so that leaves us with an unknown number of bad carrots. Let's define this amount as ""x,"" the number of bad carrots:
   - The total number of carrots (31) can be broken down into the number of good carrots (24) and the number of bad carrots (x):
   - 31 = 24 (good) + x (bad)

3. To find x, we can simply substitute our values into the equation above and solve for x. Note that because ""good"" and ""bad"" refer to different groups of carrots, we need to leave them separate in our calculations:
   - 31 = 24 + x
   - Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation:
   - 7 = x
   - So, there were 7 bad carrots. Note that this value can be negative, as it'd be possible to have more good carrots than bad ones. In this case, however, we know for certain that there were fewer bad carrots than good ones, so our final answer won't be negative.

Here's how we might show our work:

1. Total number of carrots: 
   17 (Vanessa) + 14 (mom) = 31

2. Number of good carrots: 
   24

3. To find x (number of bad carrots): 
   31 = 24 (good) + x (bad) 
   31 - 24 = x
   7 = x {The final answer is}.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Note: This is assuming ""carrots"" is a unit of weight, which makes logical sense since carrots are typically sold by weight in grocery stores. If ""carrots"" were actually referring to the number of carrots picked, we'd need to calculate the weight of each carrot for the first step (which would be much harder!).</s>",7

To find the number of people on each team after splitting into 6 teams, we first need to determine the total number of people playing. We know that there are 23 managers and 7 employees, for a total of 23 + 7 = 30 people.

Next, we split the group into 6 teams. Since we want each team to have the same number of players, we can use division to find the number of people in each team. The formula for finding the number of people on each team is:

Total number of people / Number of teams = Number of people on each team

Let x be the number of people on each team. Then, we can set up the equation:

30 / 6 = x

Using inverse operations, we can simplify this equation to:

5 = x

At this point, we can only approximate as we cannot have fractional or decimal numbers of people on each team. Therefore, we round up the value to the nearest whole number. {The final answer is:} There would be 6 people on each team.</s>",5

<|assistant|>
To find out how many more cups of flour Tiffany needs, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the total number of brownies baked by Tiffany:
   Total number of brownies = 8 brownies (baked by Tiffany)
   Total number of brownies = 17 brownies (needed for the party)
   From the given information, we can see that Tiffany has baked fewer brownies than required. So, we can say that Tiffany has baked less than 17 brownies.

2. Calculate the total number of cups of flour used by Tiffany to bake all the brownies:
   Total number of cups of flour used by Tiffany = 8 brownies x 8 cups of flour per brownie
   Total number of cups of flour used by Tiffany = 64 cups of flour

3. Calculate the total number of cups of flour needed to bake all the required brownies:
   Total number of cups of flour needed for 17 brownies = 17 brownies x 8 cups of flour per brownie
   Total number of cups of flour needed for 17 brownies = 136 cups of flour

4. Compare the total number of cups of flour used by Tiffany with the total number of cups of flour needed to bake all the required brownies:
   Total number of cups of flour used by Tiffany = 64 cups of flour
   Total number of cups of flour needed for all the required brownies = 136 cups of flour
   Since the total number of cups of flour used by Tiffany is less than the total number of cups of flour needed to bake all the required brownies, we can say that Tiffany still needs some more cups of flour.

5. Calculate the number of extra brownies Tiffany needs to bake so that she can use up all the available flour:
   Total number of cups of flour remaining with Tiffany = Total number of cups of flour needed to bake required brownies - Total number of cups of flour used by Tiffany
   Total number of cups of flour remaining with Tiffany = 136 cups of flour - 64 cups of flour
   Total number of cups of flour remaining with Tiffany = 72 cups of flour
   Let x be the number of extra brownies Tiffany needs to bake.
   Number of cups of flour required for x additional brownies = x brownies x 8 cups of flour per brownie
   Number of cups of flour required for x additional brownies = 8x cups of flour
   We need to make sure the total number of cups of flour required to bake all the brownies matches the total number of cups of flour remaining with Tiffany.
   Total number of cups of flour remaining with Tiffany = Total number of cups of flour required for all the brownies - Total number of cups of flour used by Tiffany
   Total number of cups of flour remaining with Tiffany = 136 cups of flour - 64 cups of flour
   Total number of cups of flour used by Tiffany = (8 x 64) cups of flour
   Set up the equation to find the number of extra brownies Tiffany needs to bake:
   Number of cups of flour required for x additional brownies = 8x cups of flour
   Total number of cups of flour remaining with Tiffany = 72 cups of flour
   Total number of cups of flour required to bake all the brownies = 8x cups of flour + (8 x 64) cups of flour
   Total number of cups of flour required to bake all the brownies = Total number of cups of flour remaining with Tiffany
   Resolve the equation to find the value of x:
   Solve for x:
   Number of cups of flour required for x additional brownies + (8 x 64) = 8x + (8 x 64)
   Remove the redundant terms to isolate x:
   Number of cups of flour required for x additional brownies = 8x cups of flour
   x brownies require 8 cups of flour per brownie, add up to compute the total number of cups of flour required:
   Total number of cups of flour required for x brownies = x brownies x 8 cups of flour per brownie
   So, x can be found using the following formula:

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of good carrots by n and the number of bad carrots by b.

We know that the total number of carrots picked is the sum of the good and bad carrots:

n + b = 38 (good carrots) + 29 (carrots picked by Carol) + 16 (carrots picked by Carol's mother)

Let's call x the number of carrots picked by Carol and y the number of carrots picked by Carol's mother.

So, we can write:

x = 29 (carrots picked by Carol)

y = 16 (carrots picked by Carol's mother)

Let's substitute those values in the equation above:

n + b = 38 + x + y

b = 38 + x + y - (n + x + y)

b = 38 - (n + x + y)

At this point, we don't know the values of n, x, and y, so we can't simplify further. To proceed, we need to find two other equations related to n, x, and y that will allow us to solve for b in terms of those variables.

To find the first equation, let's consider the number of good carrots picked by Carol and her mother:

number of good carrots = n + Carol's good carrots + Carol's mother's good carrots

We know that Carol picked 29 carrots, of which n were good, and her mother picked 16 carrots, of which n were good.

number of good carrots = n + 29 - 29 + n = 2n

Let's substitute this in the equation above:

2n = x + y

To find the second equation, let's consider the total number of carrots picked:

number of total carrots = 38 + x + y

Let's substitute x and y in terms of n and the number of good carrots:

number of total carrots = 38 + (x + y) - (x + y - 2n)

number of total carrots = 38 + 2(x + y) - (x + y - 2n)

After simplification:

number of total carrots = 2(x + y) + n - (x + y - n)

Since we don't know the values of n, x, and y, we can't simplify further.

Now, let's get two equations, the first one we have, the second one we just derived. We can see that we have three unknowns (n, x, y), and two equations, so we can't solve yet. We need to find another equation that will allow us to have a system of equations with three unknowns and three equations, and then we can find the values of the unknowns.

To find another equation, we need to relate x and y somehow. Let's suppose that Carol picked more carrots than her mother, or x > y.

x - y = z (number of additional carrots picked by Carol)

Let's substitute the value of z in terms of x and y in the second equation:

number of total carrots = 2(x - y + y) + n - (x - y + y - n)

number of total carrots = 2x

Let's substitute this in the first equation:

2n = x + y

After simplification:

2n = 2(x - y) + 2y

2n = 2x - 2y

Let's substitute x and y in terms of n and z:

2n = 2n - 2(z + y) + 2(y - z)

After simplification:

0 = 2(y - z)

So, either y = z or y = -z. Since we supposed that Carol picked more carrots than her mother, we can say that y is smaller than x and, therefore, y is smaller than z. Then, y = -z is impossible, and we have that y = z.

Finally, by substituting that in the first and second equation,",7

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's first identify how many problems are in total on all the worksheets. Since there are 7 problems on each worksheet and there are 17 worksheets, there are a total of 7 times 17, or 119, problems.

Next, we know that 8 of these problems have already been graded. So there are a remaining 119 - 8, or 111, problems left to be graded.

Now, we want to find out how many of those remaining problems are on the worksheets still left to be graded. To do this, we need to determine how many worksheets are still left to be graded.

We know there are 17 worksheets in total, and the teacher has graded 8 of them. So the remaining worksheets left to be graded are 17 - 8, or 9.

Since each of these remaining 9 worksheets has 7 problems, and we've already determined that there are a total of 111 problems left to be graded, we can set up a system of equations to find how many problems are left on each of the remaining worksheets.

Let x represent the number of problems left to be graded on each of the remaining 9 worksheets. Then we can represent this as:

7 x = 111

We solve for x by using algebra to isolate the variable on one side of the equation:

x = 111 / 7

x ≈ 16.

So each of the 9 remaining worksheets has approximately 16 problems left to be graded.

Now we can find out how many more problems the teacher has to grade in total:

The number of problems left to be graded = (the number of problems left on the remaining 9 worksheets) + (the number of problems already graded)

This can be found using the formula:

(7 x 9) + 8 = 111

Substituting our value for x gives us:

(63) + 8 = 111

71 = 111

So the final expression for the number of problems left to be graded is:

The final answer is 111 - 141 = -30, which is a negative number, meaning that there is an error in the problem, as it is not possible to have a negative number of problems left to be graded. Without additional context or a revised problem statement, we must assume that there is an unspecified number of worksheets that have already been graded, and therefore the given information is insufficient to determine the exact number of problems left to be graded.</s>",63

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let’s call the original 8 friends A through H and the new players X and Y.

The total number of friends (original and new) is still 8, so the number of lives for all the friends before the new players joined has to be a multiple of 8 (because each friend had 6 lives). Let’s say the original friends had a total of 48 lives before the new players joined.

When the new players joined, the total number of friends increased to 10. Let’s say the number of lives for all the friends at this point is 60.

Since each of the new players had an equal number of lives, they must have had 3 lives each. This is because the total number of lives for the new players (6 for X and Y) is 12, and the total number of lives for all the friends (48 for A through H and 12 for X and Y) is 60. Therefore, the ratio of lives for the original friends to the new players is 48:12, or 8:3.

To find out how many lives the original friends had when the new players joined, we can set up a proportion:

           Original number of lives (48)     :       Number of lives of each original friend (6)
             60 lives total (for all friends)      :       Total number of lives for original friends (48)

                  48
            --- = ---
                6
            ---
                10

In the proportion above, the left and right sides of the middle line are related by a similar triangles. The bottoms of the triangles (48 and 10) are the total number of lives for the original friends and all friends, respectively. The top of the left side of the proportion is the number of lives for each original friend, and the top of the right side is the number of lives for all friends (which is 60). Using superimposition we obtain the bottom side of the right proportion (the same number of lives for all friends) and the middle proportion becomes:

           Original number of lives (48)     :       Number of lives of each original friend (6)
          60                                   :       Total number of lives for original friends (48)

Solving for the number of lives for each original friend (C), gives:

          C * 48 = 6 * 60
          C = 96 * (6 / 48)
          C = 6 * 12
          C = 72 lives

Now we know that the original friends each had 72 lives when the new players joined. 

The final answer is: The original friends each had 72 lives when the new players joined.</s>",60

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Bianca received a total of 78 pieces of candy.
2. She ate 30 pieces of candy, leaving her with a remaining number of candies.
3. She then put the remaining candies into piles, with each pile containing ? 8 pieces of candy.
4. Let's call the number of piles B.
5. To find the number of candies in each pile (let's call this x), we can set up a system of equations:
    - Total number of candies = Number of candies in each pile * Number of piles
    - 78 = x * B
6. Now that we know the number of candies in each pile is x, we know that Bianca ate 30 candies (as stated earlier). Therefore, we can set up another equation:
    - Number of candies Bianca ate = Number of candies in each pile * Number of piles she created
    - 30 = x * B
7. We have now created a system of equations with two variables (x and B). To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution.
8. Let's substitute the value of B from our second equation into the first equation:
    - 78 = x * (30 divided by x)
    - 78 = 30 * (8 divided by 1)
9. We can now see that the ratio of candies per pile (x) is directly proportional to the number of piles (B), as the number of candies must remain the same (78).
10. By setting the value of x equal to a multiple of 8, we can determine the number of possible piles that satisfy our equation:
    - B = (78 divided by x)
11. Since we are looking at multiples of 8, our possible values of x are:
    - 8, 16, 24, ...
12. By substituting each x value back into our equation for B, we can find the possible number of piles, which can also be seen as the quotient of 78 divided by x.
13. For example, if we set x = 8, the system of equations looks like this:
    - 78 = x * B
    - 30 = x * B
14. This results in the following system:
    - B = 78 / 8
    - B = 9.875
15. This decimal value is not an integer, so we cannot have exactly 9.875 piles. The closest integer is 10, but we could round up or down depending on which value makes more sense in real life.
16. If we instead set x = 16, the system of equations results in the following:
    - B = 78 / 16
    - B = 5
17. This integer value makes more sense in real life and is the number of possible piles with 8 candies in each pile.
18. Therefore, the final answer is: Bianca could create 5 piles, each containing 8 pieces of candy, after eating 30 pieces already. {The final answer is: Bianca could create 5 piles, each containing 8 pieces of candy, after eating 30 pieces already.}

Let's represent the number of friends playing the game as x.

Initially, there were 5 friends and each of them had 8 lives. So, the total number of lives initially was:

5 friends x 8 lives per friend = 40 lives total

Then, 2 more players joined the game, so now there are (x + 2) players in total.

If we assume that each of these new players also has 8 lives, which is represented by 2! because we lose 2 positions in the original line up which will get replaced by these newly joined players, then the total number of lives is:

(x + 2) players x 8 lives per player = 16 lives from the new players

Adding the initial and newly joined players' lives, we get:

Total number of lives = Initial number of lives + Lives from the new players

                         = 40 lives + 16 lives

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of variables to represent the number of books Roger had at the beginning and the number of books he has at the end. Let's call the initial number of books x.

When Roger sold 21 of his books, he earned some money. Let's call this amount of money earned y. Since each book sold for a certain price, we can assume that the price of each book is the same. When Roger used this money to buy 30 new books, he spent a total of 30 * price per book = 30y/x books.

We know that the number of books Roger had before selling any, x, is equal to the number of books he has left after selling some, as well as the number of new books he bought, 30y/x.

Let's use equations to express all of these:

x - 21 = 30y/x (number of books Roger has left after selling 21, is equal to the number of new books times the price)

Remembering that x and y are variables, we can solve for the value of x:

x(1 - 21/x) = 30y/x

x(x - 210) = 30y

Now we need to split this into two equations, one for x and the other for y. Since we know how many books Roger sold and how many he bought, we can find the values for y.

y = (30x - 15600)/900

Finally, to find the total number of books Roger has at the end, we can use the equation x = 30y/900 + 21

The final answer is:

x = (900 * (30 * [(30x - 15600)/900]) + 21) = [(2400x - 76800)/9] + 21

We need to simplify this expression before we can consider it as our final answer. We can try to group the x terms, see if there are any x values that are zero and see if we can solve for x:

[(2400 * x) / 9 ] + [ (900 * -800)/9 ] + 21 = 0

If we let x be zero, then we would have 0 books remaining, which we know is not true. We can conclude that our simplified expression for the number of books Roger has is:

x = (30 * ((30x - 15600)/900)) + 21

Our final answer is:

The number of books Roger would have after selling 21 of his old books and buying 30 new books with the proceeds is:

Let's call the number of lives Wendy had initially as x. After losing 6 lives, she would have x - 6 lives left. Then she gained 37 lives in the next level, so her total number of lives after the second stage would be (x - 6) + 37. Therefore,

x - 6 + 37 = number of lives Wendy has in total

x - 6 = number of lives after the first stage - 6 (number of lives lost)

x = number of lives after the first stage

Substituting this into the expression for the total number of lives, we get:

number of lives after both stages = x - 6 + 37

number of lives after both stages = x + 31 (total number of lives gained in both stages)

Let's isolate x:

To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Frank had left after buying the new mower blades. Let's call this amount x. Here's how we can calculate it:

2. He spent $11 on new mower blades.
3. Let x be the amount of money Frank had left.
4. The total amount of money Frank had after spending $11 on new mower blades is the sum of what he earned ($19) and what he spent ($11). This amounts to $19 - $11, or $8.
5. Since the amount Frank had left is also called x, we can write this as an equation: $19 - $11 = x

7. Simplify: $8 = x
8. Write the answer clearly: The final answer is $8, which is the amount Frank had left after buying new mower blades.
9. To find out how many $2 games Frank could buy with this amount, we simply divide $8 by $2: $8 / $2 = 4 (note: this answer is approximate because we're working with dollars and cents. In reality, since we're dealing with cents, we would have to divide $80 by $200 to get 4 entire games.)

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many total players are there in the team. This can be calculated by adding the new players and the returning players.

   Number of new players = 48

   Number of returning players = 6

   Total number of players = New players + Returning players

   Number of players in each group = 6

3. Next, we can find out how many groups can be formed if each group has 6 players. For this, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.

   Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group

To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. First, we know that Nancy had a total of 80 files on her computer. (80 files)

2. Next, Nancy deleted 31 files. (80 files - 31 files = 49 remaining files)

3. After deleting the files, Nancy organized the remaining ones into folders. Each folder contained 7 files. We can find the number of folders required by dividing the number of remaining files by the number of files in each folder. (49 files ÷ 7 files/folder = 6.93 folders)

4. Since we cannot have a fractional number of folders, we need to convert any decimal part into whole number by rounding up (or down, depending on the scenario). In this case, it results in 7 folders. (Round up: After 6, the next number is either 7 or 8. In such a case, we round up to the nearest whole number because it represents more than or equal to the actual value.) 

5. Therefore, Nancy had a total of 7 folders with files in them, implying that the total number of folders, with both types empty and non-empty, is 7+0 = 7 folders.

{The final answer is: Nancy ended up with 7 folders.} 

Another mathematical approach to finding the number of folders would be to find out how many groups of 7 files can be formed from the total of 49 files remaining, using the formula: (n choose r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)

(49 files choose 7 folders) = (49! / (7! * (42)!)) = 7 folders

Let's represent the number of games left after selling 19 as x.

Original number of games: 39
Number of games sold: 19
Remaining number of games: x

Using algebraic formulas, we can create two equations to represent these situations.

Number of games sold: 19 = 39 - x
Boxes used: n = x / 4 (since there are 4 games in each box)

Using the first equation to find the remaining number of games, we can substitute x into the second equation to find the number of boxes used.

Number of games sold: 19 = 39 - x

Substitute this into the second equation to find the number of boxes used (n).

Boxes used: n = (39 - 19) / 4
           n = 10 / 4

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
First, let's find the number of students who were picked for the teams, denoted by P.

We know that the total number of students trying out is 65, and 17 of them didn't make the team. This means that the number of students who were picked, P, is equal to the total number of students trying out, 65, minus the number of students who didn't make the team, 17.

P = 65 - 17
P = 48

Now, we know that there were 8 groups, and the total number of students in the groups is equal to the number of students who were picked, P. We also know that the number of students in each group is the same.

Let's denote the number of students in each group by x.

8 x = P
8 x = 48
x = 6

Therefore, each group has 6 students.

{The final answer is} 6 students in each group.</s>",6

                     Isabel uploaded . 25 pictures to Facebook. She put ; 10 pics into one ? album and put the rest into 5 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the number of pictures in each album using variables. Let's call the number of pictures in the first album, excluding the one with 10 pictures, as x. Then, the total number of pictures Isabel has uploaded is:

.25 = x + 5(10)

Notice that she has uploaded a total of 10 more pictures than the number of pictures in her five smaller albums. Here, we can use the variable y to denote the number of pictures in each of the five smaller albums. Therefore:

Number of pictures in smaller albums = 5y

Now, the total number of pictures in all albums is:

.25 = x + 5y

The decimal .25 can be interpreted as a fraction like so:

.25 = 0.25 or 1/4

The decimals are equivalent to the fraction because 0.25 is 1/4. 

Using decimals, it represents 0 to 1 with an accuracy of hundredths or thousandths. While the same integer, such as 0.25, can also be presented as a fraction, such as 5/20, which is equivalent to 1/4.

We want to find the number of pictures in each album, including the one with 10 pictures. Therefore, we need to find the values of x and y.

We can also find the number of pictures in each album by finding the common difference between the albums. This common difference will tell us how many pictures are added in every consecutive album.

Let's say the number of pictures in the first album, which is not including the one with 10 pictures is x.

After the first album, which contains x number of pictures, Isabel put 10 pictures into the next album. Afterward, she put y number of pictures into each subsequent album.

In summary, x is the number of pictures in the first album, excluding the one with 10 pictures.

y is the number of pictures in each of the smaller albums.

Now let's find x and y.

We can write an equation to represent the number of pictures in each album. Let's call it n, where n is the unknown number of pictures in an unspecified album. Using our understanding of consecutive albums and common differences, the equation for n is:

N = x + (10 + y)i

i is used to represent the first, second, third, and so on, album. 

So, for the first album (i = 1), the number of pictures in that album is:

n1 = x

For the second album (i = 2), the number of pictures in that album is:

n2 = x + 10

For the third album (i = 3), the number of pictures in that album is:

n3 = x + 20

For the fourth album (i = 4), the number of pictures in that album is:

n4 = x + 30

And so forth.

Now, we want to find a formula for n, such that we can calculate the number of pictures in any specific album.

The formula would represent the total number of pictures in Isabel's albums.

From the patterns we noticed from our findings in n1, n2, n3, n4, etc. We have that each album has a starting number of x and then increments by a common difference of (10 + y).

The pattern, in general, demonstrates this:

n = x + (10 + y)i

When i is 1, we get:

n1 = x

When i is 2, we get:

n2 = x + 10

When i is 3, we get:

n3 = x + 20

We can generalize this equation to find any number of pictures in Isabel's complete collection of albums by letting I represent the specific album we are trying to find.

Now, let's find the value of x and y.

We can substitute our findings from the patterns into our first equation, .25 = x + 5(10), to find the value of x in terms of y.

.25 = x + 5(10)

.25 - 5(10) = x

x = .25",3

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's first find out how many weeks Mike's earnings will last if he only spend $5 per week. 

Mike's earnings from mowing lawns and weed eating:
Total earnings = $14 (from mowing lawns) + $26 (from weed eating) = $40

Weekly income from all sources:
Income per week = $40 / (number of weeks)

Weekly expenses (spending):
Expenses per week = $5

To find out how many weeks his earnings will last, we set up an equation for the number of weeks M that the income will last:

Income per week = Expenses per week

$40$ / M = $5$

Solve for M:

M = $40$ / $5$

M = $800$ weeks

{The final answer is: Mike's earnings will last for 800 weeks at a weekly expense of $5 per week.}

In other words, Mike's earnings from mowing lawns and weed eating will last 800 weeks (approximately 157 years) at a weekly spending rate of $5.

So, Mike can figure out how long his earnings will last at any given weekly spending rate by scaling the calculation based on income per week, expenses per week, and the relationship between them.</s>",8

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:

1. Vanessa had a total of 16 + 48 = 64 files on her flash drive, which can be represented as x.

2. After deleting 30 files, the number of files left on the flash drive is x - 30.

3. We're looking to find the value of x, so we can rewrite the equation above as:

x - 30 = x - 30 (subtracting 30 from both sides)

4. Note that x appears on both sides of the equation. To remove it, we can add 30 to both sides, resulting in:

x = x - 30 + 30 (adding 30 to both sides)

5. This equation simplifies to:

x - x + 30 = 30 (because x = x)

6. Factoring out the common term (x), we get:

x - x + 30 = 30 (x)(1) = 30 (1)

7. Now, we can solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x - x = 0 - 30 (subtracting 30 from both sides)

8. This simplifies to:

0 = -30 (subtracting x from both sides)

9. However, 0 cannot be equal to a negative number, so we've reached a contradiction. Since we can't have a negative number of files on the flash drive, our original equation x - 30 = x - 30 (from step 2) is not true. Therefore, our initial assumption that the deleted files were music files is false.

10. If we assume instead that the deleted files were video files, we can rewrite the original equation:

48 - 30 = x - 30 (number of video files = 48, number of remaining files = x)

11. We can substitute the subexpressions into the equation to simplify:

18 = x - 30 (adding and subtracting 18)

12. Now, we can rearrange the equation to isolate x:

x = 18 + 30 (adding 30 to both sides)

13. Thus, the final answer is:

{The final answer is 48}

The equation for finding x is x = 48 + 30, but we don't need to calculate x again. When we found that she didn't have 30 of her original files left, we knew that she had fewer than the original 64 total. Now we know that she has 48 video files, meaning she currently has fewer than the original 48 video files. In other words, the number of files left on her flash drive is 48 (the original number of video files she had). The equation we derived in step 1 is correct, but we can't derive a value for x now because we know that she doesn't have the original x number of files left. Therefore, we stop computing x and use what we know to find the current number of files. 

Therefore, {The final answer is 48} (she has 48 video files left on her flash drive).</s>",34

<|assistant|>
1. Calculate the total number of shirts Dave had to wash: 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts in total.

2. Write an equation to represent the number of shirts washed by Dave at the time school started:

   let x be the number of shirts (out of the total ) that Dave washed by the time school started. So the total number of shirts Dave washed by then would be 9 short sleeve shirts, as well as x long sleeve shirts. This can be written mathematically as:

   9 short sleeve shirts + x long sleeve shirts = Total number of long sleeve shirts washed at that time

   When we replace the values of short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts, the equation looks like this:

   9 + x = 20

3. Solve the equation for x:

   To get the number of long sleeve shirts Dave didn't wash, we need to find the value of x.

   Subtract 9 (the number of short sleeve shirts) from both sides of the equation:

   0 + x = 11

   Since there may be fractions, we keep the 0 as it is and move the x to the left. This is because subtracting something from something else doesn't affect those that are not subtracted.

   To solve for x, replace this equation (x = -11) with the original equation:

   9 + (-11) = 20

   This simplifies to:

   -2 = 11

   This is not a valid equation since 2 is not equal to -11.

4. The answer is wrong, let's trace backwards:

   Since the answer is not valid, there could be an error in one of the steps we took. Let's look back at each step carefully:

   1. We calculated the total number of shirts correctly.

   2. The equation we wrote is still correct.

   3. We made a mistake in step 4.

   We made a mistake in finding the value of x. Let's trace back to the equation: 9 + x = 20

   4. Let's try breaking down the number of long sleeve shirts Dave hadn't washed by a certain number, for example, 5.

   5. Redo step 4, but with a new value for x:

   9 + 5 = 14

   14 + 20 = 34

   34 - 34 = 0

   Our final answer is: Dave did not wash 5 long sleeve shirts. {The final answer is: Dave did not wash 5 long sleeve shirts}.

<|assistant|>
To find the time it will take the chef to cook the remaining 2 potatoes (out of a total of 9), we can find the total time it took for the chef to cook the first 7 potatoes, subtract that time from the total time required to cook all 9 potatoes (which we can find based on the cooking time for each potato), and then find the time needed to cook the remaining 2 potatoes based on their cooking time.

Time taken to cook the first 7 potatoes: 7 potatoes take (3 minutes per potato) 7 * 3 = 21 minutes to cook.

Time needed to cook all 9 potatoes: Each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, so for 9 potatoes, the total cooking time is 9 * 3 = 27 minutes.

Time remaining to cook the entire batch: The chef has already cooked 7 potatoes for 21 minutes. So far, a total of 21 minutes have been spent cooking. There are 2 potatoes left to cook, and it takes 3 minutes to cook each potato. It will take an additional 6 minutes (2 * 3) to cook the last 2 potatoes. The total cooking time for the entire batch is 21 minutes for the first 7 potatoes, plus the 6 minutes for the last 2 potatoes, for a total of 27 minutes.

{The final answer is}: It will take the chef 27 minutes in total to cook the entire batch of 9 potatoes.

Now that we know the total cooking time, finding the time for the remaining 2 potatoes is easy. We know that each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, and we know that the chef has already spent 21 minutes cooking, plus an additional 6 minutes cooking the last 2 potatoes. The remaining 2 potatoes will take an additional 6 * 2 = 12 minutes to cook, for a total of 27 minutes.

{The final answer is}: To cook the remaining 2 potatoes, it will take the chef an additional 12 minutes, for a total cooking time of 27 minutes.

So, in summary:

Time taken to cook the first 7 potatoes: 21 minutes
Time needed to cook the remaining 2 potatoes: 12 minutes
Total cooking time for the entire batch: 33 minutes (21 for first 7, 12 for remaining 2)

This means that, in total, it will take the chef 27 minutes to cook the entire batch of 9 potatoes, as we found earlier.</s>",6

Here's how you can solve the problem step by step:

1. Gwen took a total of 41 pictures at the zoo. Let's call this the number of zoo pictures, x.
2. Gwen took a total of 29 pictures at the museum. Let's call this the number of museum pictures, y.
3. Gwen deleted a total of 15 pictures from her vacation.
4. We want to find out how many pictures she still has.
5. When she deleted 15 pictures, she likely deleted some from both the zoo and museum trips. We'll represent the number of pictures she deleted from the zoo trip as z and the number she deleted from the museum trip as m.
6. Since Gwen deleted a total of 15 pictures, we can say:

z + m = 15

7. We now have two expressions with unknown variables - x (the number of pictures from the zoo) and y (the number of pictures from the museum).
8. From step 1, we know that Gwen took a total of x pictures at the zoo.
9. From step 2, we know that Gwen took a total of y pictures at the museum.
10. After deleting pictures, Gwen still has some from both trips. Let's call this combined total as n.
11. Gwen now has x − z pictures from her zoo trip and y − m pictures from her museum trip. She has these combined pictures n in total.
12. Combining steps 10 and 11, we get:

n = x − z + y − m

13. But we know that x − z and y − m both represent the remaining pictures in their respective trips after deletion. Let's call these r1 and r2.
14. We can substitute r1 and r2 for x − z and y − m, respectively, in the expression from step 12.
15. Therefore,

n = r1 + r2

16. From step 5 we also know that z + m = 15.
17. Let's substitute this expression for z + m in the expression we found in step 15.
18. This leads us to:

n = r1 + r2
r1 + r2 = x - 15 + y - 15
n = x - 15 + y - 15

19. The final answer is: Gwen still has n pictures from her vacation. Substituting n, x, and y values from our expression (step 18) in terms of r1 and r2, we get:

The final answer is: Gwen still has r1 + r2 pictures from her vacation.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's first create a system of equations that represents the given information. The total number of puppies at a certain point in time can be represented by a function N(t), where t is the number of days that have passed since the shelter first had the 2 puppies.

N(0) = 2          (The shelter initially had 2 puppies)
N(t) = 34 + N(0) - 34*adoption rate          (When the 34 additional puppies arrived, the shelter had a total of 34 puppies plus the initial 2 puppies. However, 34 times the daily adoption rate is the number of puppies that have been adopted, so we subtract this to find the remaining number of puppies.)

Next, let's create an equation that represents the number of puppies adopted over a specific time period. In this case, let's create an equation for the number of puppies adopted over 1 day (t = 1).

adoption rate * 4 = N(t) - N(t-1)            (If 4 puppies are adopted per day, the number of puppies adopted in a single day is the adoption rate times 4. The remaining puppies left over are represented by N(t) - N(t-1).)

We can use these equations to find how many days it will take to adopt all of the puppies at the shelter. We want the function N(t) to reach 0, once all puppies have been adopted, so we set N(t) = 0 and solve for t.

0 = 34 + 2 - 34*(adoption rate*t)            (Setting our N(t) function equal to 0 once all puppies have been adopted)
1/34 * (1 - (adoption rate * t))) = 1/34 * (1 - (2+34)/36 * t)            (Simplifying the equation)

Using the quadratic formula, we can find the value of t that solves this equation. Since t represents the number of days it takes to adopt all of the puppies, we'll ignore negative and complex solutions.

t = (-1 + (square root of 144(1-2*(34*adoption rate))/129(1-2*(adoption rate)))^2/((-1/2)*((square root of 144(1-2*(34*adoption rate))/129(1-2*(adoption rate)))^2/((-1/2)*(1-2*(34*adoption rate))))) + (square root of 144(1-2*(34*adoption rate))/129(1-2*(adoption rate)))^2/((-1/2)*((square root of 144(1-2*(34*adoption rate))/129(1-2*(adoption rate)))^2/((-1/2)*(1-2*(34*adoption rate))))) * (-1/2) * ((square root of 144(1-2*(34*adoption rate))/129(1-2*(adoption rate)))^2/((-1/2)*(1-2*(adoption rate))))))             (Using the quadratic formula)

As a simpler alternative, we can approximately solve for t by assuming a moderate adoption rate of 0.5 puppies per day (adoption rate = 0.5). Then we can use the simplified equation we created earlier for N(t).

0 = 34 + 2 - 17*t              (Plugging our adoption rate into our equation)
t = (34+2)/17            (Solving for t)

The final answer is approximately 3.5 puppies are adopted per day, which would take approximately 10 days for all of the puppies to be adopted, assuming a moderate adoption rate of 0.5 puppies per day.

{The final answer is approximately 10 days for all of the puppies to be adopted, assuming a moderate adoption rate of 0.5 puppies per day.}</s>",9

59 - 32 = 27

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces in each small load.

We know that the remaining 27 pieces will be split into 9 equal loads. To find the number of pieces in each small load, we divide the number of remaining pieces by 9:

27 ÷ 9 = 3

Each small load will have 3 pieces of clothing.

Let's represent the number of pieces of chocolate candy as x and the number of pieces of caramel candy as y.

Since Adam bought 2 boxes of chocolate candy, we know that there are 8 pieces of chocolate candy in total. Each box has 4 pieces, so 2 boxes contain 8 pieces.

x = 8

Each box of chocolate candy has 4 pieces, so the number of pieces in 2 boxes is 8.

2 * 4 = 8

Since Adam bought 5 boxes of caramel candy, we know that there are y pieces of caramel candy in total. Each box has 4 pieces, so 5 boxes contain y pieces.

y = 20

Each box of caramel candy has 4 pieces, so the number of pieces in 5 boxes is 20.

5 * 4 = 20

Now we add the number of pieces of chocolate candy and caramel candy together to find the total number of candy pieces Adam has.

Each daisy also costs $6, because the prompt says that ""each flower was $6"" and doesn't specify that this refers only to roses.

Katie bought a total of 10 flowers (5 roses and 5 daisies).

To calculate Katie's total cost, we add up the costs of all her flowers:

total cost = (number of roses) * ($6 per rose) + (number of daisies) * ($6 per daisy)

Using the values we've determined, we plug them into this formula:

total cost = 5 * $6 + 5 * $6

expanding the parentheses:

total cost = $30 for the roses + $30 for the daisies

total cost = $60 

So, Katie spent a total of $60 on her flower purchase at April's Discount Flowers during the sale.

{The final answer is: $60}</s>",60

                     At the ? schools book fair Victor bought 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books. ! If 16 of the books were used, how many new books did he buy? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to identify the unknown quantity and then set up a system of equations using the given information. Let's call the number of new adventure books Victor bought x, and the number of new mystery books he bought y.

First, we know the total number of adventure books bought is 32 (originally) plus x (new books), or 32 + x. Similarly, the total number of mystery books bought is 37 (originally) plus y (new books), or 37 + y.

Next, we know the total number of used books is 16. If we subtract the number of used adventure books and used mystery books from the total number of adventure books and total number of mystery books bought, respectively, we can find the number of new books bought in each category.

For adventure books, we have:
Total number of adventure books used = 16
Total number of adventure books (original + new) = 32 + x
New number of adventure books = Total number of adventure books (original + new) - Total number of adventure books used
New number of adventure books = 32 + x - 16
New number of adventure books = 32 - 4 (substituting 16 for the number of used adventure books)
New number of adventure books = 28

For mystery books, the calculation is similar:
Total number of mystery books used = 16
Total number of mystery books (original + new) = 37 + y
New number of mystery books = Total number of mystery books (original + new) - Total number of mystery books used
New number of mystery books = 37 + y - 16
New number of mystery books = 37 - 4 (substituting 16 for the number of used mystery books)
New number of mystery books = 33

Now we can represent this system of equations in mathematical form:

28 = 32 - 4 (adventure books)
33 = 37 - 4 (mystery books)

To solve for x and y (the number of new adventure books and new mystery books, respectively), we set up the system of equations and perform Steps 1-4 from a system of linear equations to solve for the unknown variables.

Step 1: Write the system of equations using augmented matrices.
|  | adventure books | mystery books |
|------|------------------|------------------|
|      |  32 - 4x         |  37 - 4y         |
|      |   28             |   33             |

Step 2: Interchange the rows if necessary to obtain the desired order.

|      |   28             |   33             |
|      |  32 - 4x         |  37 - 4y         |

Step 3: Subtract a multiple of one equation from another to eliminate a variable. In this case, we'll subtract twice the second equation from the first:
|  | adventure books | mystery books |
|------|------------------|------------------|
|      |        0         |      -39         |
|    1 |   28             |    85           |
|    2 |   32 - 4x       |   37 - 4y       |

Step 4: Use the elimination method to express one variable as a combination of the other variables. This gives us:
x = -5y + 14

To get the final answers, we can substitute the expression for x (in terms of y) back into the previous equation for adventure books (Step 3, Equation 1). Let's do that now.

Step 1: Write the system of equations using augmented matrices.

Let's call the number of carrots Maria had after throwing out 11 and before picking 15 more be x.

Original number of carrots: 48
Carrots thrown out: 11
Updated number of carrots, x: x - 11

Carrots picked the next day, y: 15

Total number of carrots after picking 15 more, z: x + 15

z = x - 11 + 15

z = x + 4

To find x, we can use the original number of carrots:

48 = x - 11

x = 48 + 11

x = 59

Substituting x into the equation for z, we get:

z = 59 + 4

z = 63

So, after picking 15 more carrots, Maria will have a total of 63 carrots. {The final answer is 63 carrots.}</s>",52

<|assistant|>
To find the number of roses the florist has after she picks 21 more roses, we need to first find the number of roses she has left after selling 15 of them.

Let's call the number of roses the florist originally had after selling 15 x. So, x - 15 would be the number of roses she had left.

After picking 21 more roses, the number of roses she has would be the sum of the number of roses she had left after selling 15 and the 21 more she picked.

Number of roses after picking 21 more = x - 15 + 21

Now, let's substitute the value for x. Replacing x with 50 from the original statement, we get:

Number of roses after picking 21 more = 50 - 15 + 21

Simplifying, we get:

Number of roses after picking 21 more = 36 + 21

Number of roses after picking 21 more = 57

{The final answer is}: The florist would have 57 roses after picking 21 more.</s>",56

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find the total number of math problems Isabel has to complete, we can break down the problem into steps.

1. First, let's find out how many math pages Isabel has. Since she has 2 pages of math homework, we can say:

   Isabel has 2 math pages.

2. Each page has 5 problems on it, so let's find out how many math problems Isabel has on these 2 pages:

   Isabel has 5 math problems on each page, so for 2 pages, we have:

   Isabel has 10 math problems (5 * 2) on these 2 pages.

3. Let's call the number of reading pages that Isabel has to read 'x'. Since we know she had 2 math pages and 'x' reading pages, we can say:

   Isabel has in total 2 math pages and x reading pages.

4. Each reading page has x problems on it, so let's find out how many reading problems Isabel has on all 'x' pages:

   Isabel has x reading problems on each page, so for x pages, we have:

   Isabel has x * x reading problems on all 'x' pages.

5. Let's calculate the total number of math problems Isabel has to complete:

   Isabel has 10 math problems on the 2 initial pages, but we want to find the total number of math problems she has in total, including any extra pages she might have. Let's rewrite this as:

   Isabel has 10 math problems on the 2 initial pages, and x pages with an unknown number of problems. 

   Using the ""substitute what you know"" strategy, we can replace ""initial"" pages with ""remaining"" ones, and write our equations in terms of the total number of math pages, 'p' :

   Isabel has p math pages to complete, and 2 of these pages are the initial ones. The remaining pages are 'p - 2'. Each page has 5 problems, so let's find out how many math problems Isabel has to complete in total:

   Isabel has 5 math problems on each page, so for p pages, we have:

   Isabel has 5 * (2 + p - 2) = 5 * p math problems to complete in total.

6. Now, let's add up the total number of math problems Isabel has to complete, as well as the total number of reading problems Isabel has to read:

   Isabel has 5 * p math problems to complete, and x reading pages with an unknown number of problems. Each reading page has x problems on it, so in total, Isabel has x * x reading problems. 

   Putting everything together, we can write:

   Isabel has 5 * p math problems, and x * x reading problems to complete in total.

7. Let's compare like terms, and note that in each case, we have 'math', 'x', 'pages', and 'problems' associated. By doing this, we're going to identify some patterns that will help us find a solution.

   Isabel has p pages of math problems, and 'x' pages of reading problems. For each page, Isabel has p math problems, and 'x' reading problems. Since they both share the number of pages, we can say that maybe they're related in some way.
   Based on our previous calculations, we know that Isabel has x reading problems on each page, and let's say 'y' for the number of math problems Isabel has to do on each of the 'p' pages.
   Therefore, we can rewrite our previous calculations as:

   Isabel has p pages of math problems, and 'x' reading pages with y math problems on each page.

8. Let's think about a situation in which Isabel has 2 pages of math and no reading pages (x = 0). In this case, we know that she has 10 math problems, and by step 2, we've calculated these math problems. Let's now calculate what Isabel has to do for the remaining steps, but only for the math pages.

   Isabel has 2 pages of math (p = 2), and each page has y math problems. On the second page, this has already been calculated in step 2 as 10 math problems:

   Isabel has y math problems on the first page (first page of math), and therefore we know how many math problems Isabel has to do on this page:

Let's call the original 4 friends a.

a1, a2, a3, and a4 each have 3 lives, for a total of 12 lives among the original group.

When the additional 5 players join, let's label them b1, b2, b3, b4, and b5.

Initially, we know that each of the new players also starts with 3 lives. Therefore, the total number of lives for the new players is 15.

Adding the original group's lives and the new players' lives, we know that the total number of lives is 27 (12 from the original group and 15 from the new players).

Now, let's find out how many lives each remaining player (a1, a2, a3, a4, b1, b2, b3, b4, and b5) has:

a1, a2, a3, and a4 each had 3 lives among the original group. Since they're still playing the game, they still each have 3 lives, for a total of 12 lives among the original group.

b1, b2, b3, b4, and b5 each also had 3 lives when they joined the game. Therefore, each of these new players still has 3 lives, maintaining the initial 3 lives each.

Adding up all the lives for each player, we see that the new total is 27, as we found earlier.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can create a system of equations to represent the unknown quantities. Let x represent the number of 2-dollar toys that Kaleb can buy with the money he has left.

At the beginning of the problem, Kaleb had 12 dollars. After spending 8 bucks on a new game, he has 12 - 8, or 4 dollars left.

1. Kaleb spent 8 dollars on a new game: 

     B: 8 bucks spend on game

2. Kaleb has x two-dollar toys left:

     T: x two-dollar toys

3. Kaleb has 4 dollars left:

     L: 4 dollars left

We can create an equation to represent how many two-dollar toys (T) Kaleb can buy with the 4 dollars he has left. Since each toy costs 2 dollars, we can create the equation T = L/2 (the number of toys is equal to the amount of money left divided by the cost of each toy).

     T = L/2

We also know that Kaleb had originally spent 8 dollars on a new game, and we can represent this equation as B = 8.

Combining both equations, we get:

     B = 8                      (1)

     T = L/2                      (2)

To find x, the number of 2-dollar toys, we need to find the number of 2-dollar toys Kaleb can buy with the money he has left (4 dollars). We can plug T = L/2 into equation 1 using a substitution.

     B = 8                      (1)

     T = L/2                      (2)

     Replacing T with L/2 in equation (1):

     8 = B

     Let's replace B with T = L/2 from equation (2):

     8 = T = L/2

     So, we get:

     8 * 2 = L

     Substituting this back into T = L/2:

     T = 8 / 2 = 4

     Finally, the number of 2-dollar toys Kaleb can buy with the money left, after spending 8 bucks on a game, is:

     x = T = 4 = The final answer is 4.

     Therefore, Kaleb can buy 4 two-dollar toys with the money he has left.

     We can also calculate that Kaleb originally had 16 two-dollar toys before spending 8 dollars on the game:

     16 = T + x

     Since we already have the number of toys after spending 8 dollars (x), we can calculate the number of toys Kaleb had before:

     16 = 8 + x

     16 - 8 = x

     8 = x

     Therefore, Kaleb had 8 two-dollar toys before buying the game.

     And that's how you could solve Kaleb's problem of how many 2-dollar toys he could buy after buying a game for 8 bucks.</s>",2

<|assistant|>
Let's break down the problem and solve it in steps:

1. Katie had a total of 10 pages of homework - 7 pages of math homework and 3 pages of reading homework.
2. Each page of math homework and reading homework contained 9 problems, so we can find the total number of math problems by multiplying the number of math pages by the number of problems per page.
3. Likewise, we can find the total number of reading problems by multiplying the number of reading pages by the number of problems per page.
4. Add up the total number of math problems and the total number of reading problems to get the total number of problems Katie had to complete.

Here's how it looks mathematically:

1. Total number of pages = math pages + reading pages
   Total number of pages = 7 + 3
   Total number of pages = 10

2. Total number of math problems = math pages x problems per page
   Total number of math problems = 7 x 9
   Total number of math problems = 63

3. Total number of reading problems = reading pages x problems per page
   Total number of reading problems = 3 x 9
   Total number of reading problems = 27

4. Total number of problems = total number of math problems + total number of reading problems
   Total number of problems = 63 + 27
   Total number of problems = 80

5. The final answer is: Katie had a total of 80 problems to complete.

An alternative approach to finding the total number of problems would be to multiply the total number of pages by the total number of problems per page. However, this can be more cumbersome and less clear in a situation where there are different types of homework. By breaking the problem down individually, we can better understand the structure and the types of work Katie had to complete.</s>",90

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of country albums and pop albums Janet bought by C and P, respectively. Then, we can set up a system of linear equations to find the values of C and P:

C songs per country album: 9
P songs per pop album: 9 (assuming each pop album has the same number of songs as a country album)

Number of songs from country albums: C * 9
Number of songs from pop albums: P * 9

Total number of songs bought by Janet: (C * 9) + (P * 9)

Let's write this as a system of linear equations:

6C + 2P = 54 (Number of country songs bought)
2C + 6P = 162 (Number of pop songs bought)

Now, let's solve the system of linear equations to find the values of C and P. Here's how:

First, to eliminate one of the variables (say, P), we can multiply the first equation by -2 and add it to the second equation:

-12C - 12P = -108
0C + 12P = 324 (obtained by subtracting 24 times the first equation from the second equation)

Now, we have an equation with only C and an equation with only P. Let's solve for P in the second equation:

P = 28 (obtained by dividing both sides of the equation by 12)

Now, to find C, let's substitute the value of P back into the first equation and solve for C:

-12C - 12(28) = -108

C = 12 (-108 - 336) = -480

But the number of albums cannot be negative, so this does not make sense. In fact, we made an incorrect assumption about the number of songs on each pop album. This illustrates the importance of checking assumptions when setting up linear systems!

Let's fix the problem and assume that Janet's pop albums each had 12 songs instead. Here's what the system would look like with this new assumption:

6C + 2(12) = 72 (Number of country songs bought)
2C + 6(12) = 216 (Number of pop songs bought)

First, let's eliminate C using the same method as before. Note that we're using different variable names (C and P) since the first system was incorrect:

C12 = 48 (obtained by solving the first equation for C)
P = 18 (obtained by solving the second equation for P)

The total number of songs bought by Janet is:

(12 * C12) + (12 * P) = 72 * 4 + 144 * 18 = 1080 (This can be confirmed by summing the number of songs from each album type)

{The final answer is} 1080.

Finally, let's verify that our answers are reasonable. Janet bought a total of 270 songs (6 * 9 + 2 * 12 * 9). 1080 seems like a large number, but it's certainly plausible that Janet bought a lot of songs.</s>",72

$45 \div $5 = 9 weeks

<|assistant|>
Let x be the number of books that Adam sold. Then Adam sold x out of his initial 33 books. After selling these x books, Adam earned some amount of money. Let y be the amount of money Adam earned by selling x books.

Adam used the money he earned to buy 23 new books. Let z be the number of books Adam could buy with the money he earned. Since Adam used the money to buy z books, we have:

z = y/($ per book)

Here, we are not given the price of a book, but we can find an equivalent expression for z by substituting y with its expression. Since y is the price per book multiplied by the number of books Adam sold, we can write:

z = (price per book) * x/($ per book),

which simplifies to z = x.

We know that Adam now has (33 - x) + z = 33 - x + x = 33 books.

To express this with an equation, let n be the number of books Adam now has. We can write:

n = 33 - x + x = 33

Substituting x with its expression, we get:

n = 33 - (price per book) * x/($ per book) + x = 33

This is a quadratic equation in x. To find x, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a,

where a = -1, b = $ per book, and c = -33.

The solution that corresponds to the number of books sold is:

x = -[(-$ per book)) / 2] + sqrt([(-$ per book)) / 2]^2 - 33/(-$ per book))]

We note that this expression is complicated because the price per book is not given to us. However, the equation does show us that the value of x is somewhere between the two square roots. These two square roots are real when:

b^2 - 4ac > 0,

which simplifies to:

(price per book)^2 - 2(price per book) * 2 * 33 > 0

This inequality is true since it takes only positive numbers to be squared, so:

0 < (price per book) < (2 * 33)/(2 * 33) = 2/3

We conclude that the price per book must be less than or equal to 2/3, and therefore, the value of x may not be a whole number if the sale price per book is too high.

In conclusion, Adam sold an integer number of books which can be determined, but only given the price per book. If the price per book is close to $1, we can assume that the integer number of books sold is near to 22. The exact number of books sold is:

x = -([($ per book)) / 2] + sqrt([($ per book)) / 2]^2 - 33/(-$ per book))]

Therefore, The final number of books Adam has is:

n = 33 - x + x = 33

In summary, we followed the steps below:
1. Introduce the variables x (number of books Adam sold), y (amount of money Adam earned), and z (number of books Adam bought with the money earned). 
2. Derived the expressions for x, y, and z.
3. Substituted y with its expression in terms of x and derived an equation for n (number of books Adam currently has).
4. Converted the equation for n into a quadratic equation to find x, which represents the number of books Adam sold.
5. Used the quadratic formula to determine x.
6. Derived the exact number of books Adam sold with respect to the price per book.
7. Derived the final number of books Adam has.

The final answer is:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break this down into smaller steps.

The number of cans Kaleb collected on Saturday is equal to the number of bags he filled times the number of cans in each bag. This is represented as:

Saturday cans = 5 bags * 4 cans per bag

Similarly, the number of cans Kaleb collected on Sunday is:

Sunday cans = 5 bags * 4 cans per bag

Adding the total number of cans Kaleb collected on Saturday and Sunday, we get:

Total cans = Saturday cans + Sunday cans

Substituting the equations we found above, the total number of cans is:

Total cans = 5 bags * 4 cans per bag + 5 bags * 4 cans per bag

Simplifying, we get:

Total cans = 40 cans

So the total number of cans is 40.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps. Here's how:

1. First, let's find out how many mystery books Nancy has. We know she has 2 shelves of mystery books, and each shelf has exactly 6 books. So, we can write an equation to represent the relationship between the number of mystery books (x) and the number of shelves (2):

x = 6 * 2

2. To simplify this equation, we can rewrite it using the order of operations to find the value of x:

x = 12

3. Now, we know how many mystery books Nancy has, but we still don't know how many picture books she has. To find that out, we need to consider the number of shelves dedicated to picture books (6) and the fact that each shelf has exactly 6 books.

4. We can write an equation to represent the number of picture books Nancy has (y) in terms of the number of shelves (6):

y = 6 * 6

5. Again, we can simplify this equation to find the value of y:

y = 36

6. Now that we know how many mystery books and picture books Nancy has, we can find out how many books she has in total. We can write another equation, this time representing the total number of books (z) in terms of both x and y:

z = x + y

7. We can substitute the values we found for x and y into this equation to find out how many books Nancy has in total:

z = 12 + 36

z = 48

8. So, {The final answer is: Nancy has a total of 48 books on her shelves (12 mystery books and 36 picture books).}</s>",48

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's first find out how many dollars Paul had saved before receiving his allowance. We're given that Paul had saved ""up to"" $3 dollars. This means that his initial savings was less than $3, but we'll use $3 as an upper bound. Let's say Paul's initial savings was $x. We can find this value by subtracting his initial savings from $3:

$3 - x = $0 (All of Paul's initial savings were spent before receiving his allowance)

$3 - x = $0
$0 = x + 7

Subtracting $x$ from both sides of the equation gives us:

$3 - x - x = 7

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$-2x = 7$

Dividing both sides by -2, we find that $x$ is equal to:

$x = -3.50$

However, we can't have negative savings, so this result is invalid. This means we need to adjust our initial assumption that Paul's initial savings was less than $3. We'll assume instead that Paul hasn't saved any money before receiving $7 for his allowance, meaning $x = 0$.

Now that we know Paul had no savings before his allowance, finding out how many 5 dollar toys he can afford is easy. Paul's total amount of money is now $7 (allowance) + 0 (initial savings) = $7. To find how many 5 dollar toys he can buy, we divide the total amount of money ($7) by the price of each toy ($5).

$7 / 5 = 1.4$ (number of toys)

We can't buy a decimal number of toys, so the closest whole number would be 1. Let's round up and say Paul can buy 2 5 dollar toys.

The final answer is: Paul can afford to buy 2 5 dollar toys.

Note: We assumed that Paul's initial savings was 0, but you may want to adjust it based on your personal preference. By changing this number, you'll change Paul's total amount of money, and therefore change how many toys he can afford to buy. However, as long as his initial savings is less than $3, Paul will still be able to afford at least 1 5 dollar toy with his new allowance.</s>",2

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to use addition and subtraction.

First, let's find out how many lives Wendy had after losing 8 lives in the hard part of the game. We can do this by subtracting 8 from the initial number of lives she had:

43 lives - 8 lives = 35 lives

Next, we know that Wendy gained 39 more lives in the next level. So, we can add this amount to the number of lives she had after losing 8 lives:

35 lives + 39 lives = 74 lives

Finally, we can check if our answer is reasonable. When we started, Wendy had 43 lives, and now we know she has 74 lives. This means she gained at least 31 lives, which seems like a lot for a single level. However, since we're dealing with a video game, it's possible that this is a reasonable number.

To summarize, Wendy had 43 lives, lost 8 lives, and then gained 39 lives. This leaves her with a total of 74 lives.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use a three-step approach:

1. First, let's find out how many files Katie has left after deleting 40 of them. We can express this using a mathematical formula:

   Number of files left = Original number of files - Number of files deleted

   So,

   Number of files left = 85 - 40

   Number of files left = 45

2. Next, we need to find out how many folders Katie needs to create based on the number of files left. Since Katie has put all the files into folders with 5 files each, we can calculate the number of folders required as follows:

   Number of folders = Number of files / Number of files per folder

   Using our second step, we can substitute the value of the number of files left in this formula:

   Number of folders = 45 / 5

   Number of folders = 9

3. Finally, we can determine the total number of files that Katie has now after creating the required number of folders:

   Total number of files = Number of files left + Number of files in the folders

   Total number of files = 45 + 9 x 5

   Total number of files = 60

   Therefore,

   {The final answer is} Katie has a total of 60 files on her computer now after deleting 40 files and creating 9 folders with 5 files each.</s>",9

To find the total amount of money Will made in the two days, we first need to calculate his earnings for Monday and Tuesday separately.

On Monday, Will worked for 8 hours and earned $8 per hour, so his earnings for Monday were:

$8/hour * 8 hours = $64

On Tuesday, Will worked for 2 hours, so his earnings for this day were:

$8/hour * 2 hours = $16

Adding these two amounts gives us the total amount of money Will made in those two days:

$64 (Monday's earnings) + $16 (Tuesday's earnings) = $80

Therefore, the final answer is {Will made a total of $80 in those two days}.</s>",80

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find the number of cupcakes Carol made for the school bake sale, we can represent this with an equation:

Number of cupcakes made = 19 cupcakes

To find how many cupcakes Carol sold, we can write this in a separate equation:

Number of cupcakes sold = 6 cupcakes

Let's call the number of cupcakes Carol had left after selling 6 cupcakes as x. Then we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Number of cupcakes left after selling 6 = x cupcakes

We can find the number of cupcakes Carol made after selling the first 6 and then making more by setting up another equation:

Number of cupcakes made after selling 6 = x + 27 more cupcakes

Now, we can use these equations to find the missing values.

First, let's use the second equation to find x:

Number of cupcakes left after selling 6 = x cupcakes

Carol sold 6 cupcakes, so the number of cupcakes left after selling 6 is the total number of cupcakes (19) minus the number of cupcakes sold (6).

Number of cupcakes left after selling 6 = 19 - 6 cupcakes

We can set up an equation using this information:

x = 19 - 6

After solving:

x = 13 cupcakes

Now that we know how many cupcakes Carol had left after selling the first 6, we can use this in the equation to find the total number of cupcakes she made:

Number of cupcakes made after selling 6 = x + 27 more cupcakes

Substitute x and simplify:

19 = 13 + 27

After combining like terms:

19 = 40

The final answer is 40 cupcakes, but this is not what we're looking for. We want to find the total number of cupcakes Carol made, which we can represent with our original equation:

Number of cupcakes made = 19 cupcakes

The final answer is 19 cupcakes, the same number used to represent how many cupcakes Carol made originally. 

However, we can still solve the problem by ignoring the second equation we created to find x and continuing with the original equations provided. Let's represent the number of cupcakes Carol sold with a new variable y and follow through the steps:

Number of cupcakes sold = y cupcakes

Let's call the number of cupcakes left after selling y cupcakes z.

Number of cupcakes left after selling y = z cupcakes

Now we can set up an equation to represent the number of cupcakes Carol made after selling y cupcakes:

Number of cupcakes made after selling y = z + 27 more cupcakes

Let's substitute y and z into the first equation to find a value for y. Let's also combine like terms to simplify:

19 - y = z + 27

Add y to both sides:

19 = z + 27 + y

At this point, we have four unknown variables involved: y, z, x, and the final number of cupcakes made. However, we only need to focus on the first three variables, as we're trying to find the final number of cupcakes made.

So, let's solve the new system of equations:

1. Number of cupcakes left after selling y = z cupcakes

2. Number of cupcakes made after selling y = z + 27 more cupcakes

3. Number of cupcakes left after selling 6 = x cupcakes

The first two equations allow us to find the values of z and y, leaving us only with one unknown variable, x.

After solving:

y = 12 cupcakes

z = 3 cupcakes

We can substitute y and z back into the original equation to find the total number of cupcakes Carol made:

19 = 3 + 27

After combining like terms:

19 = 30

The final answer is 30 cupcakes, which is more than the 19 cupcakes we",40

Let's represent the number of people who showed up as x, and the number of people who didn't show up as y.

We know that x + y = 14, since there were a total of 14 members.

Since 7 people didn't show up, y equals 7. Now, we can find x:

x + 7 = 14
x = 14 - 7
x = 7

So, there were 7 people who showed up. Each person who showed up scored 5 points, so the total number of points scored by the people who showed up is:

7 * 5 = 35

But what about the points scored by the people who didn't show up? We're not given an answer for this, but we can assume that either they didn't score any points or they didn't score any points in this particular game. Let's say they didn't score any points.

The total number of points scored is the sum of the points scored by the people who showed up and the points scored by the people who didn't show up. Since we've already found the points scored by the people who showed up, we just need to find the points scored by the people who didn't show up, which we assumed was 0:

Let's call the two team members who didn't show up A and B.

The original team had 5 members, so A and B must be two of them. Let's say that the names of the three team members who showed up are C, D, and E.

We know that each team member who did show up scored 6 points. So, the total number of points scored by the team members who showed up is:

6 * C + 6 * D + 6 * E = total points scored by team members who showed up

Now, let's find the total points scored by the whole team, including the points scored by A and B, who didn't show up.

Total points scored by the whole team = total points scored by team members who showed up + points scored by A and B (who didn't show up).

We know that each person who showed up scored 6 points, so let's call the number of points scored by A and B when they showed up X and Y, respectively. Then:

total points scored by whole team = total points scored by team members who showed up + X + Y

Let's substitute the expression for the total points scored by team members who showed up into this equation:

total points scored by whole team = 6 * C + 6 * D + 6 * E + X + Y

The question asks what the final number of points scored by the whole team is. Let's call this number Z. So:

Z = 6 * C + 6 * D + 6 * E + X + Y

The problem provides the information that the total number of team members is 5, so C, D, E, A, and B each make up some part of the whole team. We want to find out the values of X, Y, and Z. Let's think about the situation of who didn't show up.

The team members A and B, with scores X and Y, respectively, didn't show up. So, the values for X and Y, when adding them with Z, should be less than the total points scored by the whole team on every occasion where A and B didn't show up. This means the values that X and Y could take are constrained.

Now, let's find the values that the variables C, D, E, X, and Y could take. Let's assume that C, D, and E each showed up, so each of C, D, E, takes a value between 0 and 5. However, since A and B didn't show up, the sum of C, D, E, A, and B must be 5.

There's a maximum value that X and Y can take depending on how many people were needed to reach the minimum required number of 5 team members. Let's assume that at least two people are needed, as otherwise we wouldn't have the situation of two missing members.

Assuming that C, D, and E showed up, the maximum values for X and Y are 3 and 2, respectively, since together with C, D, and E, we need to reach a total of 5 team members.

The final answers for X and Y are determined by the point scores. X and Y should be less than the highest possible score, which is 18 points (a maximum of 6 points per person times 3 persons who showed up). Therefore, the least possible value for each is 0 points.

We can fill in the values of X and Y, now that we know that they should be between 0 and 18 points. Since X and Y are both between 0 and 18 points, we can substitute them into the expression above:

Z = 6 * C + 6 * D + 6 * E + X + Y

This is our final equation, and now we can find the number of points scored by the whole team. We've shown every step we took, so we can finish by stating the final result:

Final answer: The total number of points scored by the whole team is Z. Z is the solution to the equation: 

Z = 6 * C + 6 * D + 6 * E + X + Y

To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many books Oliver will have to put away. Since a librarian took 10 books, the total number of books left for Oliver is 46 - 10, which is 36 books.

Next, we need to determine how many books Oliver will put on each shelf. Since Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf, this is the same as saying that each shelf holds a total of 4 books.

Now that we know the number of books Oliver has to put away and the number of books on each shelf, we can calculate the number of shelves needed using the following equation:

number of shelves = total number of books / number of books per shelf

Substituting our known values into this equation, we get:

number of shelves = 36 books / 4 books per shelf

Using basic arithmetic, we can divide 36 by 4 to find that Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all of the remaining books:

number of shelves = 9 shelves

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's call the unknown number of coins Luke has in total as x. We can break this down into two parts - the number of coins in quarter piles and the number of coins in dime piles.

First, let's find the number of coins in the quarter piles. Since there are 5 piles and each pile has 3 coins, we can use the formula 5 × 3 to get:

Number of coins in quarter piles = 15

Next, let's find the number of coins in the dime piles. Again, using the formula 5 × 3, we can find that each dime pile has 15 coins. We can then use the formula 5 × 15 to find the total number of coins in the dime piles:

Number of coins in dime piles = 75

To find the total number of coins, we add the number of coins in the quarter piles and the number of coins in the dime piles:

Total number of coins = Number of coins in quarter piles + Number of coins in dime piles

Replacing the known amounts, we get:

Total number of coins = 15 + 75 {The final answer is} 90

Therefore, Luke has a total of 90 coins.

Note: In this problem, we assumed that each quarter and each dime consisted of 3 coins. If the problem had stated that some of the quarters or some of the dimes had more than 3 coins, we would have to modify the solution accordingly.</s>",30

So, Gwen earned 1 point for the first 3 pounds of paper (0 points), 2 points for the next 3 pounds (6 pounds), and 3 points for the remaining 1 pound (5 pounds in total). Therefore, Gwen earned a total of 10 points for recycling 5 pounds of paper. {The final answer is: Gwen earned 10 points.}

2. Calculate the number of points earned by Gwen's friends. Let's assume Gwen's friends recycled x pounds of paper. For every 3 pounds of paper recycled, Gwen's friends earned one point. Therefore, Gwen's friends earned 1 point for every pound of paper recycled over 3 pounds. So, Gwen's friends earned 1 point for the first 3 pounds of paper (0 points), 2 points for the next 3 pounds (6 pounds), and so on, up to the remaining (x-16) pounds of paper. Therefore, Gwen's friends earned a total of 16 points for recycling the first 16 pounds of paper, and they earned (x-16) points for recycling the remaining pounds of paper.

3. Summarize the points earned by Gwen and her friends. Gwen earned 10 points, and Gwen's friends earned 16 points for recycling the first 16 pounds of paper, and (x-16) points for recycling the remaining pounds of paper. Therefore, the total number of points earned by Gwen and her friends is 10 points earned by Gwen, and (x-16) + 16 points earned by Gwen's friends for recycling the remaining (x-16) pounds.

Now we have all the information we need. Putting it all together:

Gwen earned 10 points and Gwen's friends earned [(x-16) + 16] points for recycling (13 + 5) pounds of paper in total. Therefore, the total number of points earned by Gwen and her friends is:

10 points (Gwen) + [(x-16) + 16] points (Gwen's friends) = 26 points (total)

Note: The steps followed above could also be written as an equation to get the points earned by Gwen's friends (x), which would look like this: Gwen's friends earned 16 points for recycling the first 16 pounds, and (x-16) points for recycling the remaining (x-16) pounds, which gives us (16 + x - 16) points in total, or simply, x points.

Now Gwen and her friends can put the bags out for collection and look forward to their rewards, knowing that they've earned lots of points for their hard work! {The final answer is: Gwen and her friends earned a total of 26 points for recycling 18 pounds of paper.}</s>",6

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's call the number of Haley's friends attending the concert x.

The total cost of the tickets for Haley and her friends (3 tickets at $4 each) is $12 (3 times $4).

The cost of the extra tickets in case someone else wanted to go is $5 times the number of extra tickets (let's call this y).

So the total amount spent on tickets is:

$12 (for Haley and her friends)

$5y (for the extra tickets)

Adding these two costs together gives us the total cost:

$12 + $5y

Let's substitute in the variable names from our steps 1-2, and simplify:

3 times $4 (for Haley and her friends)

$5 times x (if friends attended)

$5 times y (extra tickets)

Adding these three costs together:

$12 (initial tickets)

$5x (friends attended)

$5y (extra tickets)

$12 + $5x + $5y (adding all costs)

This is the formula for finding the total amount Haley spent. Now we know what needs to be done, and we're almost ready to calculate the total amount, but we need to know how many extra tickets were bought. Once we figure this out, we can find the value of y, and then we'll have all the information needed to find the total cost.

Let's think about the situation here for a second. If no one else wants to go, then all of the extra tickets will go unused (y will be zero), and we've already accounted for that by not counting the cost of those tickets. That means y will be a positive integer somewhere between 0 and 5, depending on how many of her friends came along.

To make things clear, let's assign y a definite value, but say that Haley hasn't decided how many extra tickets to buy yet. This way we can use our steps as a template, and still end up with Haley's total cost (when we've figured out y, that is).

In the end, we'll write: {The final answer is}.

Thus, we have:

Haley spent $12 (for herself and her friends)

$5 times x (for her friends who went)

$5y (for the leftover tickets)

$12 + $5x + $5y (calculating the total cost)

In other words:

12 + 5x + 5y (to indicate the formula)

{The final answer is}.

As you might've guessed, we didn't quite finish the problem, but we're very close.

Now we can't simplify $5y because we don't know y, but we do know that it's somewhere between 0 and 5. So, we'll leave our formula as is, and then find the value of y through an estimation (which you can calculate if you'd like to), and then we'll substitute it into the formula to find our answer.

How many extra tickets did Haley buy?

Let's assume for simplicity that four of Haley's friends agreed to attend, and that she's not sure whether or not to buy any extra tickets. That means that x will be 4.

We're interested in finding how many extra tickets Haley will buy (y), so that the total cost is as small as possible.

Let's assume for simplicity that Haley will buy y = 0 extra tickets (meaning no one else wants to go), then the total cost is:

12 + 5 times 4 (her friends) + 0 (no extra tickets)

Now let's estimate what might happen if we make a few tiny changes to the scenario we've just described. Let's assume for simplicity that Haley bought 1 extra ticket (y = 1), so that instead of buying no extra tickets, she bought 1 extra ticket, and again let's assume that 4 out of her total 5 friends agreed to attend.

In this scenario, the total cost would be:

12 + 5 times 4 (her friends) + 5 (one extra ticket)

We've increased the total cost by the cost of the",32

Let's call the amount of money George had before his birthday be $x. After receiving $16 for his birthday, his new total would be $x + 16. However, he spent $38 on a new game, leaving him with $x + 16 - 38 dollars. Combining these two expressions, we have:

x + 16 - 38 = 30

We can simplify this to:

x = -5

Since negative initial amounts don't make sense in this scenario, we can conclude that the given information does not have a unique solution. It's possible that George didn't have any money before his birthday, but it's also possible that one or more values are mistaken.

So, in this situation, we can't determine how much money George currently has. {The final answer is unknown due to the inconsistency in the information provided.}</s>",8

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we will need to first find the number of pictures in each album, which is the same for all 9 albums since the problem states that there are the same number of pictures in each album.

Let x be the number of pictures in each album. Since Robin uploaded a total of 36 pictures (31 from her phone and 5 from her camera), we can set up an equation to find x:

36 = 9x

36 divided by 9 is approximately 4, so let's say that x = 4.

Next, let's find the number of pictures in the first 8 of the 9 albums, since we know that each album has 4 pictures. This should give us a starting point for finding the number of pictures in the remaining (9th) album.

First 8 Albums: 8 albums times 4 pictures each is 32 pictures.

First 8 Albums = 32 pictures

Last (9th) Album: We want to find an unknown number of pictures (let's say y) in the last album that, when added to the first 8 albums, gives us the total number of pictures uploaded (36).

First 8 Albums + Last Album = 36 pictures

32 + y = 36

Subtracting 32 from both sides:

y = 36 - 32

y = 4

So we know that there are 4 pictures in the last (9th) album. 

Total Number of Pictures: We can now sum up the number of pictures from all 9 albums and check if we get the number of pictures uploaded (36).

9 times 4 pictures each is 36 pictures.

Total Number of Pictures = 36 pictures

The final answer is: Robin uploaded 36 pictures to Facebook, with 9 albums each containing 4 pictures. The number of pictures in each of the first 8 albums is 32, and the remaining (9th) album contains 4 pictures. {The final answer is: Robin uploaded 36 pictures to Facebook, with 9 albums each containing 4 pictures.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break this problem into smaller steps to help us understand how to solve it. 

1. Mike earned a total of $69 from mowing lawns over the summer. We can write this as an equation:
    earnings = $69
    or, equivalently, we can say Mike's earnings are 69 dollars.

2. After purchasing a new mower and blades for $24, Mike has $45 ($69 - $24) left over. We can set up an equation relating Mike's remaining earnings to his initial earnings and the cost of the mower and blades:
    earnings - $24 = $45 {left over}
    or, explicitly, we can say the cost of the mower and blades is $24, and Mike's remaining earnings after purchasing them are $45.

3. To find out how many five-dollar games Mike can buy with his remaining dollars, we need to divide the remaining dollars by the cost of one game, which is $5:
    games = remaining dollars / $5
    or, explicitly, we can say the number of games that can be bought with Mike's remaining dollars is [games].

4. Substituting our expression for the remaining dollars (from Step 2) into the expression for games, we get:
    games = (earnings - $24) / $5
    or, explicitly, we can say the number of games that Mike can buy with his remaining dollars is [games].

So, to summarize, the final answer to this problem has the form ""Mike can buy [games] five-dollar games with his remaining dollars.""
  
   Let's substitute our expressions from Steps 1 and 2 into Step 4 to compute the exact value of [games]:
    games = $(earnings - $24) / $5
    games = ($69 - $24) / $5
    games = 45 / $5
    games = 9

   Therefore, Mike can buy 9 five-dollar games with his remaining dollars. The final answer is: ""Mike can buy 9 five-dollar games with his remaining dollars.""</s>",9

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can first determine how many minutes it took Maria to assemble all four pieces of furniture. As each piece took her 8 minutes, the total time for all four pieces is:

4 pieces x 8 minutes per piece = 32 minutes

So Maria spent a total of 32 minutes assembling all the furniture.

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it took Maria to assemble just the chairs. As she bought two chairs, we can calculate this by finding the time it took her to assemble each chair and then multiplying it by two:

1 chair took 8 minutes to assemble
2 chairs took 2 x 8 = 16 minutes to assemble

Now we know that Maria spent a total of 32 minutes assembling all four pieces of furniture. We also know that she spent 16 minutes assembling the chairs. Thus, we can find out how long she spent assembling the tables by subtracting the time for chairs from the total time:

Total time = Time for chairs + Time for tables
32 minutes = 16 minutes + Time for tables
Time for tables = 32 minutes - 16 minutes
Time for tables = 16 minutes

Therefore, Maria spent a total of 16 minutes assembling the two tables. As we found that it took her 32 minutes to assemble all four pieces of furniture, and we now know how long it took her to assemble each set of furniture, all that's left to do is to add them up to get the total time needed for Maria to finish assembling everything:

Total time = Time for chairs + Time for tables
Total time = 16 minutes + 16 minutes
Total time = 32 minutes

So, the final answer is: Maria took a total of 32 minutes to finish assembling all four pieces of furniture. {The final answer is 32 minutes}.</s>",32

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent Rachel's picture-taking and deleting as equations. Let x be the number of pictures Rachel has from her vacation after deleting some. 

First, Rachel took a total of 6 pictures at the zoo. Let y be the number of these zoo pictures she still has. Then, the number of zoo pictures Rachel deleted is 11 - y. (We use 11 - y because we want the number of deleted pictures to be the difference between the total number of deleted pictures and the number of zoo pictures that were not deleted.) We can represent the number of deleted zoo pictures as:

11 - y (number of deleted zoo pictures = total number of deleted pictures - number of not-deleted zoo pictures)

Next, we know that Rachel had originally taken 9 pictures at the museum. The number of these she still has after deleting some is x - 6. Again, let p be the number of these museum pictures that were deleted. The relationship between p and x - 6 is the same as the relationship between 11 - y and x:

p = 11 - (x - 6)

Now we have equations involving x, y, and p, so we can set them up in a system to solve for x, the total number of pictures Rachel still has from her vacation:

y = x - 6 (number of zoo pictures Rachel still has = total number of pictures Rachel still has - number of zoo pictures she took but has not yet deleted)

p = 11 - (x - 6) (number of museum pictures Rachel deleted = total number of deleted pictures - number of museum pictures she had not yet deleted)

We can eliminate y and p, which will let us solve for x. From the first equation, we can substitute (x - 6) for y:

x - 6 = x - 6 - 11 + p

Now we see that the two expressions for x must be equal, because they are both x. To simplify the equation, we combine like terms (terms with the same variable and coefficient) on the right:

0 = -11 + p

We can see that p must be 11, because when we substitute it back into our equations, all values make sense. Therefore, we can solve for x in terms of p:

x = y + 6 = 0 - 6 + 6 = 6

So Rachel has 6 pictures remaining after deleting 11 pictures, for a total of 6 from the zoo and 0 from the museum.

<|assistant|>
Let's find the total number of cookies Maria has.

chocolate chip cookies: 5
oatmeal cookies: 19

total cookies: chocolate chip cookies + oatmeal cookies

total cookies = 5 + 19

total cookies = 24

Next, let's find how many cookies are in one baggie. Each baggie has 8 cookies.

number of cookies in one baggie = 8

Now, we know that Maria is making baggies with 8 cookies in each baggie. We can find how many baggies Maria can make with the total number of cookies she has.

baggies = total cookies / number of cookies in one baggie

baggies = 24 / 8

baggies = 3

Therefore, Maria can make 3 baggies with the total number of cookies she has. We can also find the exact number of baggies she can make by finding how many baggies can be made with the number of chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies she has.

For the chocolate chip cookies:

baggies (chocolate chip cookies) = number of chocolate chip cookies / number of cookies in one baggie

baggies (chocolate chip cookies) = 5 / 8

baggies (chocolate chip cookies) = 0.625

For the oatmeal cookies:

baggies (oatmeal cookies) = number of oatmeal cookies / number of cookies in one baggie

baggies (oatmeal cookies) = 19 / 8

baggies (oatmeal cookies) = 2.375

Adding the number of baggies made from the chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies:

number of baggies = baggies (chocolate chip cookies) + baggies (oatmeal cookies)

number of baggies = 0.625 + 2.375

number of baggies = 3

Hence, regardless of how many baggies are made from each type of cookie individually, the result ends up being the same as when we calculated baggies with the total number of cookies.

Therefore, Maria can make 3 baggies in total. {The final answer is 3.}</s>",3

   - 1 rose costs $3.
   - 1 daisy also costs $3, since the sale applies to all flowers.

2. Calculate the total cost of the roses.
   - Zoe bought 8 roses, so the total cost of the roses is $8 (8 roses each costing $1).

3. Calculate the total cost of the daisies.
   - Zoe bought 2 daisies, so the total cost of the daisies is $6 (2 daisies each costing $3).

4. Add the costs of the roses and daisies to get the total cost.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we will create two systems of equations to represent Bianca's organization of the mystery and picture books. Then, we will find where the systems intersect to determine how many total books Bianca has.

System 1 (Mystery Books):
Let x be the number of mystery books on each shelf.
Then, the total number of mystery books is:
5 shelves with 8 books each = 40 mystery books in total.

5x = 40

System 2 (Picture Books):
Let y be the number of picture books on each shelf.
Then, the total number of picture books is:
4 shelves with 8 books each = 32 picture books in total.

4y = 32

Now, we can find the intersection point of the two systems of equations.
We can substitute x into System 2 with the value we found for x in System 1. This will allow us to find the number of picture books in terms of the number of mystery books.

First, we substitute x from System 1 into System 2:

4(5x/40) = 32
x = 1

Now, we have found the value of x that satisfies both systems at once. This means that Bianca has one mystery book per shelf.

Next, we can find the value for y in terms of x.

y = 8*4 = 32 mystery books / (5-4) shelves = 16 mystery books per picture book shelf.

Since there are four picture book shelves, that gives us:

4y = 64 mystery books

Now, let's find the total number of books on all shelves put together.

Total number of mystery books = 5(8) = 40
Total number of picture books = 4(16) = 64

Putting it all together:

Total number of books = 40 + 64 = 104

<|assistant|>
To find the number of pages John will use, we need to determine how many cards he will have in total (8 new cards and 16 old cards) and then divide that by the number of cards per page (3) to get the number of pages needed. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. John has a total of 8 new cards and 16 old cards. This gives us a total number of cards of 24 (8 new + 16 old).

2. Each page holds 3 cards. We divide the total number of cards (24) by the number of cards per page (3) to find the number of pages needed to hold all the cards.

3. The calculation is as follows:

   24 cards total

   Divide by 3 cards per page

   = 8 pages needed (final answer)

   {The final answer is} 8 pages.

   So, John will need 8 pages to organize all his new and old baseball cards in the binder.</s>",8

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations to represent the relationship between the number of brownies baked, the amount of flour used, and the total amount of flour required. Let's define the following variables:

- n: the number of brownies baked (a positive integer)
- x: the amount of flour used per brownie (a positive real number)
- y: the total amount of flour required for the party (a positive real number)

Using this notation, we can write the following equations:

- Amount of flour used by Isabel in baking n brownies: n * x
- Total amount of flour required for the party: y
- Total amount of flour used by Isabel in baking 3 brownies (before the party): 3 * x

Now let's use these equations to create a system:

- 3 * x = Flour used by Isabel before the party
- y = 5 * x + Flour still needed (this is an expression, not a number)

We can rearrange the second equation to solve for the unknown variable:

- y = 5 * x + Flour still needed
- Subtract 5 * x from both sides:

- y - 5 * x = Flour still needed
- Rename the new variable:

- Let z = y - 5 * x

So now we have:

- 3 * x = Flour used by Isabel before the party
- z = Flour still needed

And since Isabel used 5 cups of flour on each brownie, we have:

- x = 5 (because 5 is the number of cups of flour used per brownie)

Now that we have x, we can substitute it into the equations to get the amount of flour still needed:

- Flour still needed = z
- Rename the equation of the second step:

- y - 15 = z

Let's subtract 15 from both sides:

- y = z + 15

Thus, we have:

- Isabel used 15 cups of flour before the party (3 brownies with 5 cups of flour each)
- The total amount of flour required for the party is 5 times the amount of flour Isabel uses on each brownie, plus the remaining amount needed:

- y = 5 * x + z = 5 * 5 + z

Let's substitute x and the equation for z:

- y = 25 + z

We have expressed the second equation in terms of the first (y), so we can eliminate it from the system using algebraic operations. Since we want to find z, let's equate it with the x term on the right-hand side of the simplified equation:

- z = y - 25

So now we have:

- Isabel used 15 cups of flour before the party (3 brownies with 5 cups of flour each)
- Isabel still needs z (in terms of y) additional cups of flour for the party:

- z = y - 25

Finally, since we already know that y = 30 (total amount of flour required for the party), we can substitute it into the equation for z to find how many cups of flour are still needed:

- z = y - 25
- Substitute y = 30:

- z = 30 - 25

- Flour still needed = 5 cups

So the total amount of flour needed for the party is:

- Total amount of flour = Flour used before the party + Flour still needed
- Total amount of flour = 15 + 5

- Total amount of flour = 20 cups

The final answer is:

- Isabel still needs 5 cups of flour for the party, to make a total of 30 cups required.
- After baking 3 brownies with 5 cups of flour each, Isabel has used a total of 15 cups of flour.
- Therefore, the total amount of flour required for Isabel's party is 20 cups.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's represent the number of cupcakes Maria has made so far as x.

Firstly, Maria made 19 cupcakes in total for the bake sale. This can be written as:

x = 19

Next, Maria sold 5 cupcakes. This means that she had x - 5 cupcakes remaining. However, we also know that she then made 10 more cupcakes after selling those 5. So, the total number of cupcakes she now has is the remaining x - 5 cupcakes, plus the 10 new ones she made.

x - 5 + 10 = Number of cupcakes

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x - 5 = Number of cupcakes - 10

Since we're unsure of what the final answer is, we can't simplify the variables yet. It's important to remember this first step so we can easily back-track and find where our numbers came from.

To proceed, we should try to get the variable we're trying to find (in this case, the number of cupcakes she has) on its own. We can do this by isolating x by getting rid of the -10 on the right side. To do this, we'll add 10 back to both sides of the equation:

x - 5 + 10 = Number of cupcakes - 10 + 10

Simplifying this gets us:

x = Number of cupcakes

Therefore, we can now say for certain that Maria has the exact same number of cupcakes as we do in our ""Number of cupcakes"" variable. Let's replace x with this variable to confirm:

19 = Number of cupcakes

This tells us that Maria currently has 19 cupcakes. Now that we're clear on that, let's simplify the rest of the equation we originally found:

x - 5 = Number of cupcakes - 10

We can now substitute the value we found for x into this formula:

19 - 5 = Number of cupcakes - 10

After simplification:

14 = Number of cupcakes

So, the final answer is:

The final answer is 14.

                    question:
                     Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair. He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth and decided to use the rest on rides. If ? each ride cost 4 tickets, how many rides could he go on? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the concepts of systems of equations with two variables. Let's let x be the number of rides Tom went on, and let y represent the number of remaining tickets after Tom went on these rides.

First, let's write down the system that represents Tom's situation:

1. The number of tickets Tom initially had is equal to the number of tickets he used at the ""dunk a clown"" booth (28) and the number of tickets he used for the rides (x times 4).

   Tom's tickets = 40 = 28 + 4x

2. After Tom went on all his rides, there should be some remaining tickets (y). We can write this situation as:

   x tickets for the rides = y remaining tickets

   x = y / 4 (as each ride cost 4 tickets)

Now, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (x and y):

   a1x + b1y + c1 = 0 (Tom's initial tickets)
   x = y / 4   (x and y from going on the rides)

Our next step is to eliminate one of the variables (usually the one that appears with the coefficient of 1) to get a single equation with one variable.

Let's eliminate y from both equations. After simplifying, we can get:

   a1x + b1(y/4) + c1 = 0 (Tom's initial tickets)
   x = y / 4   (x and y from going on the rides)

   Multiply both sides of the second equation by 4:
   4x = y

   Substitute the value of y we got (from the ""ride"" equation) to the first equation:

   a1x + b1(4x) + c1 = 0 (Tom's initial tickets)

   Combine like terms:

   (a1 + 4b1)x + c1 = 0

   Rearrange:

   x = -c1 / (a1 + 4b1)

   We have the final answer:

   {The final answer is} x = Round(-400(28 - 40) / (4(40 - 28)))

Tom could go on approximately 5 rides, as calculated by rounding the decimal to the nearest whole number.</s>",3

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to apply the concept of changes in quantity. As there is a change in the number of students at the fourth grade, we can represent it as a mathematical equation.

Initially, there were 31 students in the fourth grade. Let's represent this quantity as x.

During the first year, 5 students left the fourth grade. This reflects a decrease in the number of students, which we can represent using a minus sign (-). So, the number of students after the first year is x-5.

Similarly, 11 new students joined the fourth grade during the first year. This increase in the number of students can be represented using a plus sign (+). So, the number of students after the first year becomes (x-5) + 11.

Let's call this value 'y', representing the number of students in the fourth grade after the first year.

y = (x - 5) + 11

Now, we have found out the number of students in the fourth grade after the first year (y). Our final answer will be the value of 'y'.

Step 1: Identify the given information
- Maria bought 35 green towels and 21 white towels
- She gave her mother 34 towels (total of both colors)

Step 2: Find the number of green towels Maria gave to her mother
- To find this, we subtract the number of green towels she has left with her from the total number of green towels she bought
- The number of green towels she has left with her is unknown, so let's call it x
- The total number of green towels she bought is 35
- We know she gave her mother 34 towels, and some of them were green and some were white
- Let's assume a and b are the number of green and white towels Maria gave to her mother, respectively
- To find the number of green towels she gave, we set up the system of equations
   - x green towels + a green towels = 34 green towels (given)
   - 21 - a white towels = 21 - b white towels (given)
   - where a and b are unknown integers
- Solving this system of equations, we get a=32 and b=1. Therefore, Maria gave her mother 32 green towels and 1 white towel

Step 3: Find the number of green towels Maria has left with her
- The number of green towels Maria has left with her is the difference between the number of green towels she bought and the number of green towels she gave to her mother
- The number of green towels she bought is 35
- The number of green towels she gave to her mother is 32
- The number of green towels Maria has left with her is 3

Step 4: Find the total number of towels Maria has left with her
- To find this, we add the number of green towels she has left with her to the number of white towels she has left with her
- The number of white towels she has left with her is 21 - 1 (given)
- Therefore, the total number of towels she has left with her is 3 green towels + 20 white towels = 23 towels in total

Step 5: Indicate the final answer
{The final number of ! towels Maria has left with her is 23.}
or, more equivalently:
{The final number of towels -- both green and white -- that Maria has left with her is 23.}

In summary:
- Maria bought 35 green towels and 21 white towels
- She gave her mother 34 towels (32 green and 1 white towel)
- Therefore, Maria has 3 green towels and 20 white towels left with her, making a total of 23 towels left over.

To find Adam's final score, let's first find the number of questions answered correctly in total. In the first half, Adam answered 8 questions correct, and in the second half, he answered 2 questions correct, for a total of 10 questions answered correctly in both halves. This means that Adam answered a total of 10/(1/2) = 20 - (1/2) = 15 questions correctly during the entire game.

Each question was worth 8 points. Therefore, Adam earned 15 * 8 = 120 points from the questions he answered correctly.

Now that we know how many points Adam earned from answering questions correctly, we also need to find out how many points he may have lost for incorrect answers. Since we do not have information about the incorrect answers or penalties, let's assume that Adam did not lose any points for incorrect answers (which could lead to a higher score than the actual one, but this is a reasonable assumption since most trivia games do not deduct points for incorrect answers).

Finally, let's put everything together to find Adam's final score:

Adam's final score = number of correctly answered questions * point value per question + (assumed) points lost for incorrect answers

<|assistant|>
Let's call the number of points earned by Bianca's friends x. Since Bianca recycled 24 pounds and earned one point for every three pounds, she earned 8 points. This can be calculated as follows:

24 pounds ÷ 3 pounds/point = 8 points

As for Bianca's friends, they recycled 3 pounds each, and since they earned one point for every three pounds recycled, they each earned one point. This means they earned a total of x points.

Let's sum up the points earned by both Bianca and her friends, which can be found using the formula 

pounds recycled ÷ 3 pounds/point = points earned.

Bianca earned 8 points, and her friends earned x points. So, in total:

(24 pounds recycled by Bianca ÷ 3 pounds/point) + x points = Total points earned

Solving for 'x':

((24 pounds recycled by Bianca ÷ 3 pounds/point) + x points) - 8 points (already earned by Bianca) = Total points earned

We can simplify this equation to:

(8 + x) points = Total points earned

Now, we know the total points earned. Let's find out how many points were earned in total.

Let's assume the maximum points earned are 100 points.

100 points = Total points earned

Substituting the equation we found earlier, we get:

100 points = (8 + x) points

Let's solve for 'x':

100 points = 8 points + x points

100 points - 8 points = 8 points + x points

92 points = x points

In other words, Bianca's friends earned 92 points.

To find the number of chicken wings each friend receives, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know that there are a total of 13 chicken wings from the chef before the group arrives. (3 + 8 = 11; the chef likely prepared 2 wings that were neither eaten by the group nor by the chef.)

2. The group arrived and the chef prepared 10 more chicken wings for them, making a total of 23 chicken wings altogether.

3. Since each friend gets the same number of chicken wings, we can find the amount received by one friend by dividing the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends.

4. So, let's say there are x chicken wings for each friend. Then:

    x + 8 = 13      (Each friend receives x chicken wings, and there are 8 pre-cooked chicken wings at the restaurant.) 

    x + 30 = 23      (The group arrived, and the chef cooked 30 additional chicken wings — we subtracted 2 already-eaten chicken wings.)

5. We can see that we have two equations in two unknowns, x and the number of friends. Let's solve for them:

    Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2, we have:

        0 = -17 + x

    This simplifies to:

        x = 17

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for calculating the number of ways to divide a group into subgroups, with each subgroup containing a specific number of items.

Let's represent the number of new players as x and the number of returning players as y. We are told that x + y = 8 (the total number of players on the team).

The coach wants to divide the team into 4-player groups. This means each group will have 4 players, and we want to calculate the number of possible groups that can be formed under these conditions.

First, we want to figure out how many possible groups we can form with only new players. Each group would have all x new players, so there would be x/4 groups (rounded down because a fraction of fewer than 4 players is not possible).

Next, we want to figure out how many possible groups we can form with only returning players. Since there are y returning players, we can calculate the number of possible groups using the same formula as we did for the new players. There would be y/4 returning player groups (rounded down).

Now, let's find out how many possible groups we can form with a combination of new and returning players. We can choose any number of new players (0 to x) and any number of returning players (0 to y) to place into each of the groups.

To calculate the number of possible groups, we use the formula for calculating the number of ways to choose k items from a group of n items (n choose k). We want to choose k = 4 new and y - k returning players for each group, and so we have k new players (0 to x) and y - k returning players for the remaining 4 players in each group.

The formula for this calculation is as follows:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

We can calculate C(x, 4) to determine the number of possible groups with only new players and C(y - 4, 4) to determine the number of possible groups with only returning players.

Overall, the formula to calculate the number of possible groups with a combination of new and returning players is:

C(x, 4) * C(y - 4, 4)

Let's substitute our known values into these formulas:

Number of groups with only new players:
x/4 = integer quotient of x divided by 4
We are looking for an integer, so if x is a multiple of 4, we can simply use x/4 to find the number of possible groups. If x is not a multiple of 4, we round x/4 down to find the integer number of possible groups.

Number of groups with only returning players:
y/4 = integer quotient of y divided by 4

Number of groups with a combination of new and returning players:
C(x, 4) * C(y - 4, 4)

Now, we can put all of these answers together to calculate the total number of possible groups, which should equal the number of groups the coach can form with the given set of players:

Total number of possible groups = Number of groups with only new players + Number of groups with only returning players + Number of groups with a combination of new and returning players

Remembering that the final answer is what we want!

The final answer is:

Total number of possible groups = x/4 + y/4 + C(x, 4) * C(y - 4, 4)

{The final answer is: Total number of possible groups = x/4 + y/4 + C(x, 4) * C(y - 4, 4)}</s>",2

1. The painter has already painted 2 rooms.
2. Each room takes 5 hours to paint.
3. Let's call the time taken to paint the remaining rooms x.
4. We know that in total, the painter has spent a total of 5 hours painting the first 2 rooms.
5. To find out how long it will take the painter to complete the remaining 4 rooms, we need to add the time he has already spent painting the first 2 rooms and the time it takes to paint the remaining 4 rooms.
6. The time taken to paint the first 2 rooms is 2 x 5 = 10 hours.
7. The time taken to paint the remaining 4 rooms is 4 x 5 = 20 hours.
8. The total time taken to paint the first 2 rooms and the remaining 4 rooms is 10 + 20 = 30 hours.
9. As we know that the painter has already spent 10 hours painting the first 2 rooms, to find out the time remaining for him to complete painting the rest, we need to find out the remaining 20 hours for the remaining 4 rooms.
10. To find out the remaining 20 hours for the remaining 4 rooms, we need to subtract the time already taken by the painter to paint the first 2 rooms (10 hours) from the total time it takes to paint the remaining 4 rooms (20 hours).
11. The time remaining for the painter to complete painting the rest is 20 - 10 = 10 hours.
12. Therefore, the painter will take an additional 10 hours to complete painting the remaining rooms, making a total of 30 hours he started and 40 hours to complete all 6 rooms.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
1. Firstly, we need to find the number of people left in the section after 14 customers left, which is the total number of customers (22) minus the number of customers who left (14).

   Total customers - Customers who left = Number of customers remaining

   This can be written as: 22 - 14 = x

   Solving for x, we have: x = 8

   There are 8 customers remaining in the section.


2. We now know that 14 customers left, so we can find the number of tables those customers were sitting at. Each table has 4 people, so we divide the number of customers who left by the number of people per table:

   Number of customers who left divided by number of people per table = Number of tables they were sitting at

   This can be written as: 14 ÷ 4 = y

   Solving for y, we have: y = 3

   There were 3 tables with the customers who left.


3. From the problem statement, we already know that prior to the 14 customers leaving, there were 22 customers in total. We also know that there were a total of 22 - 14 = 8 customers remaining, and 3 tables with those who left. Summing the 8 remaining customers with the 3 tables who left, we can find the total number of tables (both those with the customers who remained and the customers who left):

   Number of customers remaining + Number of tables customers left = Total number of tables

   This can be written as: 8 + 3 = z

   Solving for z, we have: z = 11

   There were a total of 11 tables.


4. Dividing the total number of customers remaining (8) by the number of people per table (4), we can find the number of tables with the customers who remained:

   Number of customers remaining divided by number of people per table = Number of tables they were sitting at

   This can be written as: 8 ÷ 4 = w

   Solving for w, we have: w = 2

   There were 2 tables with the customers who remained.


5. We know that each table has 4 people, so we can find the number of customers sitting at each of the remaining tables:

   Number of people per table times Number of tables they were sitting at = Number of customers sitting at those tables

   This can be written as: 4 × 2 = r

   Solving for r, we have: r = 8

   There are 8 customers sitting at the 2 tables with the remaining customers.


6. Summing the number of customers sitting at the tables where the 14 customers left (the 3 tables) and the number of customers sitting at the remaining tables (2 tables), we can find the total number of customers at the end:

   Number of customers sitting at tables where 14 customers left + Number of customers sitting at remaining tables = Total number of customers

   This can be written as: 12 + 8 = t

   Solving for t, we have: t = 20

   There are a total of 20 customers in the section at the end.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the total number of clothing items as 120, and the number of clothing items placed in the first load as 48. Let's call the number of clothing items placed in each small load as x.

Since there are 9 small loads after the first large load, we know that the total number of clothing items in the small loads is:

x * 9 = 48 (remaining clothing items)

To find the value of x, we can set up and solve this linear equation:

x * 9 = 48

x = 48 / 9

x = 5.33 (The answer is approximate as we cannot split clothing items equally into small loads with decimals)

Let's round x to the nearest integer, which is 5. Therefore, the number of clothing items that could go in each of the small loads is 5.

Finally, we can indicate the answer with {The final answer is}. Thus, the answer to the questioned would be: {The final answer is 5 pieces of clothing that could go in each of the small loads}.</s>",8

<|assistant|>
1. At the start of the fourth grade, there were 10 students. (Given)

2. During the year, 4 students left the fourth grade, which means 6 students (10 - 4) remained. (Calculation)

3. In addition, 42 new students came to the school. (Given)

4. Let's find out how many of the new students joined the fourth grade. We know that at the end of the year, there were all the remaining students from the beginning of the year, plus the students who joined the fourth grade.

5. So, the formula to find out how many students joined is:

   Total students at the end of the year = Total students from the beginning of the year + Total new students joining (both the entire school and the fourth grade in particular)

   Total students at the end of the year = Total students from the beginning of the year + New students joining fourth grade

   Total students at the end of the year for the entire school = Total students from the beginning of the year + New students joining (entire school)

   But we know that all new students joined the school, so all new students joined the fourth grade, which means the new students joining the entire school equals the new students joining fourth grade.

   Total students at the end of the year for the entire school = Total students from the beginning of the year + New students joining fourth grade

   Let's call the new students joining fourth grade ""x"".

6. Now, let's use this formula for the entire school, but we only care about new students joining the fourth grade.

   Total students at the end of the year for fourth grade = Total students from the beginning of the year + New students joining fourth grade

7. With this, we know that all new students from the entire school joined fourth grade, which means all new students for the entire school are also new students for fourth grade.

8. Then, we can find out the new students joining fourth grade.

   Total students at the end of the year for fourth grade = Total students from the beginning of the year + New students joining fourth grade

   Total students for fourth grade at the end of the year = Total students from the beginning of the year + 42 new students joining fourth grade

   Total students for fourth grade at the end of the year = 10 - 4 + 42

   Total students for fourth grade at the end of the year = 38 students

9. Putting it all together, we have our final answer.

   The final answer is: There were 38 students in the fourth grade at the end of the year.

   (By substituting ""x"" with ""42"" in step 6 and solving for ""x"", we found ""x"" = 42, which represents all new students joining fourth grade)

<|assistant|>
Let's break down this problem into smaller, more manageable steps.

1. Roger is helping put away a total of 14 books at the library.

2. A librarian helps, taking away 2 books.

3. After the librarian leaves, Roger is left with the remaining books.

4. Each shelf can hold 3 books.

5. We need to find out how many shelves Roger will need to fit all the remaining books.

6. Let's call the number of shelves required x.

7. When the librarian leaves, there are 14 - 2 = 12 books left.

8. After the librarian leaves, we cannot say for certain how many books Roger has left since we do not know how many were left by the librarian.

9. Since we do not know the exact number of books Roger has left, let's call it y.

10. To find out how many shelves Roger will need, we need to find out how many books are on each shelf.

11. Since each shelf can hold 3 books, and we do not know how many books Roger has left, let's call the number of books per shelf z.

12. Now we have an equation in terms of unknowns z, y, and x: 12 = x * z

13. We want to solve for x in terms of the variables y and z, so let's divide both sides by z: 12 / z = x

14. Since we do not know the value of z, we can't solve directly for x. However, we know that x is an integer since it's the number of shelves required.

15. Let's determine a value for z, and we'll assume that Roger can put away all 14 books and we'll assign a value of 1 to z.

16. Now re-write the equation in terms of y and x: 12 = x * 1

17. Dividing both sides by 12: x = 12 / 1 = 12

18. So Roger will need 12 shelves to fit all the books.

19. If we assume that each shelf can hold 3 books, then each shelf has 3 books, and we know that Roger has 14 books.

20. Let's make a list of the number of books on each shelf:

Shelf 1: 3 books

Shelf 2: 3 books

...

Shelf 12: 3 books

Total number of books: 14

21. We can add this list if we want to confirm that we have accounted for all the books.

We have reached the end of our problem, and the answer to our question is:

Roger will need 12 shelves to fit all the remaining books. {The final answer is}.</s>",4

<|assistant|>
Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Initial number of tulips picked: 39
2. Initial number of roses picked: 49
3. Total initial number of flowers picked: 39 + 49 = 88
4. Number of used flowers: 81
5. Number of unused flowers: 81 out of 88
        = 88 - 81
        = 7
6. Let x be the number of extra flowers picked.
7. Total number of flowers picked after picking extra x flowers: 39 + x (for tulips) and 49 + x (for roses).
8. Now, note that the total number of flowers picked after picking extra x flowers should be equal to the number of used flowers, that is, 81.
9. Therefore, 39 + x and 49 + x should add up to 81.
10. Solving this linear equation, we have:
      39 + x = 81 - 49
      x = 81 - 49 - 39
      x = 1 (Because x can't possibly be a negative value)
11. This tells us that no extra tulips were picked - x for tulips is actually 0.
12. Let's find the number of extra roses picked:
      x = 49 + x - 39
      x = x - 10
      Substituting our result from step 10:
      x = 1 - 10
      This cannot be true, because x should be greater than or equal to 0 (because it represents the number of extra flowers picked).
13. Therefore, there can't be any extra flowers picked.
14. The final answer is that she picked the exact same number of flowers as she used, which was 81.

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the time it takes Emily to assemble one chair (4 minutes) as x, and the time it takes her to assemble one table (6 minutes) as y.

Emily bought a total of 4 chairs and 2 tables. Therefore, she spent a total of 4x minutes assembling chairs and 2y minutes assembling tables. Since she spent a total of 8 minutes on each piece of furniture, we can set up the system of equations:

4x + 2y = 8 (Total time spent assembling chairs and tables)

Now we need to find y, the time it takes Emily to assemble one table. We know the x value (the time taken to assemble one chair) and have set up a system of equations involving both x and y. We can use the second equation, which represents the time taken to assemble all the tables, to find y:

2y = 8 (Time taken to assemble 2 tables)

Dividing by 2 and simplifying gives:

y = 4 (The time taken to assemble one table)

Now we know how long it takes Emily to assemble each table. To find how long it took her to finish assembling all the furniture, we can find the total time taken to assemble all the chairs and tables, using our two known values:

Time taken to assemble chairs = 4x
Time taken to assemble tables = 2y = 8
Total time taken = 4x + 8

We can use the expression for the total time taken to find the amount of time it took Emily to finish putting all the furniture together. The final answer is:

Time taken to finish = 4x + 8 (Total time taken)

Substituting for x and y, using the expressions we found for each, gives us:

Time taken to finish = 16 + 8 = 24 (Minutes)

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of grouping (orcombining) objects into groups based on a common attribute.

Let's break down the question and follow each step of reasoning:

1. The pet store has 6 bird cages.
    - The total number of bird cages is 6.

2. Each cage has 2 parrots and 7 parakeets in it.
    - The number of parrots (P) in each cage is 2.
    - The number of parakeets (K) in each cage is 7.

3. We can find the total number of parrots using the following formula: 
    - Since each cage has 2 parrots, the total number of parrots (TP) is the number of cages (C) multiplied by the number of parrots (P) per cage:
      TP = P * C
      TP = 2 * 6 (cages)
      TP = 12
    - {The final answer is: The pet store has a total of 12 parrots.}

4. We can find the total number of parakeets using the following formula:
    - Since each cage has 7 parakeets, the total number of parakeets (TK) is the number of cages (C) multiplied by the number of parakeets (K) per cage:
      TK = K * C
      TK = 7 * 6 (cages)
      TK = 42
    - {The final answer is: The pet store has a total of 42 parakeets.}

5. To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we add the total number of parrots (TP) and the total number of parakeets (TK):
    - Total number of birds (B) = TP + TK
      B = 12 + 42
      B = 54
    - {The final answer is: The pet store has a total of 54 birds.}

6. So, the pet store has a total of 6 bird cages, with each cage containing 2 parrots and 7 parakeets. This sums up to a total of 12 parrots, 42 parakeets, and 54 birds in the pet store.

Let's translate the problem into mathematical equations.

- Number of short sleeve shirts washed: x (where x is an unknown number)
- Number of short sleeve shirts not washed: 9 - x
- Number of long sleeve shirts washed: y (where y is an unknown number)
- Total number of long sleeve shirts: 27
- Number of long sleeve shirts not washed: 27 - y

First, let's find out how many shirts Dave had washed in total (both short sleeve and long sleeve) by school time.

Total number of shirts washed: x + y

Next, we know that Dave had washed 20 shirts by school time. Let's subtract this number from the total number of shirts washed to find out how many shirts remained unwasched.

Unwashed shirts: Total number of shirts - 20

Substituting the known values, we get:

Unwashed shirts: (x + y) - 20

To calculate how many short sleeve shirts remain unwashed, we can find the number of short sleeve shirts not washed and subtract that from the total number of short sleeve shirts that haven't been washed.

Number of short sleeve shirts not washed: 9 - x

Total number of short sleeve shirts not washed: (9 - x) + (27 - y) - (number of short sleeve shirts not washed in 'Total number of shirts not washed')

Let's label the term 'Total number of shirts not washed' as 'z'.

z: (9 - x) + (27 - y)

Substitute the value of z (which we found in the previous step) into the formula for 'Unwashed shirts' above.

Unwashed shirts: (x + y) - 20

Unwashed shirts: [(9 - x) + (27 - y)] - 20

Now, let's expand and simplify this expression.

Unwashed shirts: 27 - x - y

To find out how many short sleeve shirts Dave did not wash, we can subtract the number of short sleeve shirts he did wash from the total number of short sleeve shirts he had.

Short sleeve shirts not washed: 9 - x

Short sleeve shirts washed: x

Let's label the number of short sleeve shirts Dave did not wash as 'a'.

a: 9 - x

Finally, we obtain the number of long sleeve shirts that Dave did not wash by subtracting the number of long sleeve shirts Dave did wash from the total number of long sleeve shirts.

Long sleeve shirts not washed: 27 - y

Long sleeve shirts washed: y

Let's label the number of long sleeve shirts Dave did not wash as 'b'.

b: 27 - y

Now, to answer the original question, we can add the number of short sleeve shirts Dave did not wash and the number of long sleeve shirts Dave did not wash.

Total number of shirts not washed: a + b

Total number of shirts not washed: (9 - x) + (27 - y)

Let's simplify this expression to find our answer.

Total number of shirts not washed: 36 - (x + y)

Step 1: Find the total number of pictures taken by Haley on vacation

Haley took 50 pictures at the zoo and 8 pictures at the museum. Therefore, the total number of pictures taken by Haley on vacation is:

50 pictures at the zoo + 8 pictures at the museum = 58 pictures in total

Step 2: Find the number of pictures Haley had left after deleting some

After deleting 38 pictures, Haley is left with the remaining pictures. To find the number of pictures left, we find the difference between the total number of pictures and the number of pictures deleted. Therefore:

Total number of pictures - Number of pictures deleted = Number of pictures left

58 pictures in total - 38 pictures deleted = Number of pictures left

Step 3: Simplify the expression

Let's simplify the expression above:

58 - 38 = Number of pictures left

x roses (initially)

x - 3 = y flowers (after selling 3 roses)

y + 34 = z flowers (after picking up 34 more flowers)

Substituting y in terms of x in Equation 2, we get:

x - 3 + 34 = z flowers

Simplifying this expression, we get:

x = z - 34

Let's find a value for z in terms of the number of roses after picking up 34 more roses:

z = (Number of roses after picking up 34 more flowers)

Substituting z in Equation 3, we get:

x = (Number of roses after picking up 34 more flowers) - 34

Let's substitute x, y, and z with their values:

x = (Number of roses after picking up 34 more flowers) - 34

   (Number of roses after picking up 34 more flowers) = 5 + 3 (after selling 3 initially)

   (Number of roses after picking up 34 more flowers) = 8

   (Number of roses after picking up 34 more flowers) - 34 = 4

   x = 4

Thus, the florist initially had 4 roses after selling 3 and picking up 34 more roses. {The final answer is 4.}</s>",36

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many regular sodas and how many diet sodas fill one shelf in Cody's fridge. Then, we can use this information to calculate the number of shelves required to hold all the sodas.

Firstly, let's calculate the number of regular sodas on one shelf:

4 regular sodas (already bought) per shelf
6 regular sodas per shelf (in total)

Divide the number of sodas already bought by the total number of sodas on the shelf to find out the fraction of regular sodas on each shelf:

4 / 6 = 2/3

So, each shelf in Cody's fridge contains 2/3 of the total number of regular sodas.

Next, we can do the same for the diet sodas:

44 diet sodas (already bought) per shelf
6 shelves (maximum possible)

Divide the number of diet sodas already bought by the total number of diet sodas on the shelf to find out the fraction of diet sodas on each shelf:

44 / 6 = 7

So, each shelf in Cody's fridge contains 7 diet sodas.

Now that we know how many regular and diet sodas are on each shelf, we can calculate the number of shelves required to hold all the sodas.

Let's start with the regular sodas:

Total number of regular sodas: 4 (already bought) + (2/3) * x (number of shelves required to hold the remaining sodas)

Simplify the equation:

4 + 2x/3 = x

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2x/3 = x - 4

Multiply both sides by 3:

2x = 3(x - 4)

Simplify:

x = (2/3)(x - 4)

Substitute x - 4 for x:

x = (2/3)(x - 4) + 4

This equation can be solved using a process called iteration, where you recursively substitute the right-hand side of the equation for the unknown variable (x) until it becomes a function of itself. 

I'll execute this process three times:

x = (2/3)(x - 4) + 4

Substitute (2/3)(x - 4) for x:

x - 4 = (2/3)(x - 8) + 8

Substitute -4 for (-4) + 8:

-4 = (2/3)(-4 - 8) + 12

Simplify:

-4 = -20

This is not possible because a variable cannot have a negative value. Therefore, it follows that this equation does not have a unique solution, which means that Cody cannot fit all the regular sodas in his fridge.

Now let's solve for the number of diet sodas:

Total number of diet sodas: 44 (already bought) + 7x (number of shelves required to hold the remaining sodas)

Simplify the equation:

44 + 7x = x

Subtract 44 from both sides:

7x - 44 = x - 44

Divide both sides by 7:

x - 6 = (x - 44)/7

Substitute (x - 44)/7 for x - 6:

x = (x - 44)/7 + 6

Execute iteration:

x = (x - 44)/7 + 6

Substitute (x - 44)/7 for x:

(x - 44)/7 = (x - 50)/7 + 6 - 50

Simplify:

(x - 44)/7 = -10 + (x - 50)/7

This equation does not have a unique solution. This means that Cody cannot fit all the diet sodas into his fridge either.

Therefore, Cody won't be able to fit all his sodas into his fridge, as neither the regular sodas nor the diet sodas can fit. His fridge could fit less than 6 shelves if some space in the fridge is",8

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can first find the total number of debaters on the team, which is the sum of the number of boys and girls. Let's call this number T.

T = 26 boys + 46 girls

Substituting the values, we have:

T = 26 + 46

T = 72

Now, we want to find the number of groups that can be formed when splitting the team into groups of 9. Let's call this number G.

G represents the number of complete groups that can be formed, which is equal to the total number of debaters divided by the number of debaters required per group.

G = Total number of debaters / Number of debaters required per group

G = 72 / 9

G = 8 remainder 0 

Since the division results in an exact quotient with no remainder, this tells us that we'll be able to form a whole number of complete groups - G= 8

In other words, we can form 8 groups of 9 debaters each.

{The final answer is: The schools debate team could make 8 groups of 9 debaters each when splitting into groups of 9.}</s>",8

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of apples ordered.

Let x be the number of green apples ordered. Then, the school ordered 6 red apples, which is a fixed number. So, we can write:

Number of red apples ordered = 6 red apples

Number of green apples ordered = x green apples

Total number of apples ordered = 6 red apples + x green apples

Substituting the number of red apples ordered and simplifying, we get:

Total number of apples ordered = 6 + x

Now, we need to calculate the number of apples eaten by the students.

Let y be the number of green apples eaten by the 5 students who wanted fruit. Since each student got a fraction of an apple, we divide y by 5 to get the total number of green apples eaten.

Number of green apples eaten by students = y green apples consumed by 5 students

Number of red apples eaten by students = 0 (no students wanted red apples)

Total number of apples eaten by students = y green apples

Now, to find out how many apples are left over, we need to subtract the number of apples eaten by the students from the number of apples ordered.

Number of apples left over = Total number of apples ordered - Total number of apples eaten by students

Simplifying, we get:

Number of apples left over = 6 + x - y

This gives us the total number of apples left over after lunch. To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we find the difference between the extra number of apples and the number of apples eaten by the students (i.e. 5 students wanted fruit).

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples left over - Number of green apples eaten by students

Simplifying, we get:

Number of extra apples = (6 + x - y) - y

Now, let's simplify this further by using algebraic techniques to get the final number of extra apples. First, we can divide both sides by 5 to get the number of green apples eaten by each student.

Number of green apples eaten by each student = y / 5

So, for the five students who wanted fruit, we get:

Number of green apples eaten by each student = x / 5

Now, we can simplify our expression for the number of extra apples.

Number of extra apples = (11 + x / 5 - x / 5) - (x / 5)

Taking out the common term, we get:

Number of extra apples = (11 - x / 5)

This gives us the final formula for the number of extra apples left over.

Now, let's put some values into our formula to calculate the number of extra apples they ended up with. Using the expressions we derived in the previous steps, let's say x = 15, which is the original number of green apples the cafeteria ordered for the students' lunches.

Substituting this into our expression for the number of extra apples, we get:

Number of extra apples = (11 - 15/5)

Simplifying, we get:

Number of extra apples = -1

But this result is obviously incorrect as we can't have a negative number of apples. This is because we're assuming that the number of green apples eaten by the 5 students who wanted fruit is greater than the number of green apples ordered. However, if we assume that y, which represents the number of green apples eaten by the students, is less than the number of green apples ordered, then number of extra apples will be positive.

The problem tells us that 5 students wanted fruit, so let's say that 4 of these students ate one green apple each, and one student ate two green apples. In that case, we can say that four students ate 4 green apples, and one student ate 2 green apples, making a total of 6 green apples eaten by the 5 students who wanted fruit. So, the total number of green apples eaten by the students is y = 6.

Substituting this value of y into our expression for the number of extra apples, we get",16

To find the number of people on each team if 9 managers and 15 employees split into 8 teams for volleyball, we can first calculate the total number of people. We know that there are 9 managers and 15 employees, so the total number of people is 9 managers plus 15 employees, or 24 people in total.

Next, we want to divide these people into 8 teams of equal size. Let's call the number of people on each team x. We can use the formula for dividing a total number of objects equally into a certain number of groups to find x.

Number of objects / Number of groups = Number of objects in each group
24 people / 8 teams = x people on each team

To solve, we can set up an equation:

24 ÷ 8 = x

Following the steps of division, we can find that each team will have 3 people.

Let's call the original 4 books in the bin ""A.""
When they sold 3 books, they removed them from the bin, leaving 1 book (let's call it ""B"") in the bin. The total number of books after selling the original 4 and 3 (A - 4 and B - 3) is:

    4 - 4 = 0 books left in the bin from the original 4 (A)

    B - 3 = -3 books left in the bin from the original 1 (B)

    Therefore, there were -3 books left in the bin (not possible).

    Let's rephrase the problem and assume that the books left in the bin after selling the original 4 (A) would be 10 more than the original books left (B). After selling the original 4 and 3, B is now 10 less than the new number of books left. Set up equations for this:

    B - 3 = 10 - (B + 10)

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the number of potatoes left to cook. Since the chef has already cooked 5, and he needs to cook a total of 13, the number of potatoes left to cook is:

13 (total number of potatoes) - 5 (number of potatoes already cooked) = 8

2. Next, find the time it takes to cook one potato. According to the problem, each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

3. Calculate the time it takes to cook the remaining 8 potatoes, using the fact that one potato takes 6 minutes to cook. We can do this by multiplying the time it takes to cook one potato by the number of potatoes left to cook:

8 (number of potatoes left to cook) * 6 (time it takes to cook one potato) = 48 minutes

4. Since the chef has already cooked 5 potatoes, we subtract that amount of time from the total time it takes to cook all 13 potatoes. We know it takes 6 minutes to cook each of the first 5 potatoes, so:

5 * 6 = 30 minutes

5. Now we can find the total time it will take the chef to cook all 13 potatoes. Using the fact that it takes 6 minutes to cook each potato, we calculate that:

13 (total number of potatoes) * 6 (time it takes to cook one potato) = 78 minutes

6. Finally, note that we're now looking specifically for the time it takes to cook the remaining 8 potatoes, which we already calculated to be 48 minutes.

7. Putting all our calculations together, we can now answer the question:

The final answer is 48 minutes.

Alternative:

Another way to solve this problem would be to use a proportion. First, calculate the time it takes to cook all 13 potatoes (as we did in step 5). For example:

1 - (The quantity we know) / (The total quantity) = (The unknown quantity) / (The total quantity)

13 / (13) = (Number of minutes it takes to cook 13 potatoes) / (780)

5 / (13) = 8 / (8 + x)

5 * (8 + x) = 8 * 5

5 * 8 = 40

We can ignore the ""x"" from this equation because it's the number of remaining unspecified minutes, and we're only interested in the time it takes to cook the remaining 8 potatoes.

Substituting ""x"" for ""40"" we have that:

8 / (8 + 40) = 6 / 6

144 / 48 = 24 / 24

Now, since both equations are equivalent, let's find ""x"" substituting the calculated values:

8 / (8 + 40) = (Number of minutes it takes to cook the remaining 8 potatoes) / (40)

144 = (Number of minutes it takes to cook the remaining 8 potatoes) * (40) / (8)

144 * (8) / (40) = (Number of minutes it takes to cook the remaining 8 potatoes)

36 minutes = (Number of minutes it takes to cook the remaining 8 potatoes)

Our final answer is:

The final answer is 36 minutes.

Both methods lead to the same answer, so it's up to you to use the method that you find easier and more clear to interpret.</s>",48

To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of math problems Paige has after finishing some at school. We know that she originally had 43 math problems, and she finished 44 of them at school. Therefore, her total number of math problems left to do at home is:

43 math problems - 44 problems finished at school = 9 math problems left to do at home

Next, we need to find how many science problems she has left to do. We know that she originally had 12 science problems and finished none of them at school, so she has all 12 still left to do at home:

12 science problems left to do at home

Now, we can combine the two remaining amounts of math and science problems to find the total number of problems she has left to do at home:

9 math problems left to do at home + 12 science problems left to do at home = 21 problems left to do at home

Finally, we can check our answer by comparing it to the original number of problems Paige had, subtracting the ones she finished at school. We started with 43 math problems and 12 science problems, minus the 44 math problems she finished at school. We should end up with approximately 21 remaining math and science problems at home, which is what we found.

Here's a summary of the steps we took:

1. Find the total number of math problems left to do at home by subtracting the ones she finished at school from the original number.
2. Find the total number of science problems left to do at home by subtracting the ones she finished at school (which is 0, since she finished none).
3. Add the remaining math and science problems to find the total number of problems left to do at home.

<|assistant|>
Solution:

1. Let's first calculate the price of each rose when there is a discount. As each flower is discounted by 10%, the new price is 92% of the original price. Therefore, each rose (regular price $X) now costs $X * 0.92 = $0.84 (discounted price).

2. Using the new price for a rose, we calculate the price of a single rose when Vanessa buys it during the sale:
   - Regular price for a rose: $X
   - Discounted price for a rose: $X * 0.92 = $0.84
   - Sale price for a rose: $X - $0.08 = $0.84
   - Substitute ($X - $0.08) for $X and simplify: $0.84 = $0.84 - $0.08
   - Subtract $0.08 from both sides to isolate $X: $X = $0.84 - $0.08 = $0.76

3. We repeat the same calculation for daisies:
   - Regular price for a daisy: $D
   - Discounted price for a daisy: $D * 0.92 = $0.896 (discounted price)
   - Sale price for a daisy: $D - $0.08 = $0.896
   - Substitute ($D - $0.08) for $D and simplify: $0.896 = $0.896 - $0.08
   - Subtract $0.08 from both sides to isolate $D: $D = $0.896 - $0.08 = $0.816

4. With the prices of a single rose and daisy, we can calculate the total price for Vanessa's purchase:
   - Price of 0.3 roses: $0.76 * 0.3 = $0.228
   - Price of 0.3 daisies: $0.816 * 0.3 = $0.245
   - Total price: $0.228 + $0.245 = $0.473

5. We use a decimal point to write our answer clearly:

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Olivia uploaded a total of 40 pictures to Facebook, 5 of them from her phone and 35 from her camera. Let's represent that with a system of equations:

   a) Pictures from phone: 5 = x

   b) Pictures from camera: 35 = y

   c) Total pictures: 40 = x + y

   where x represents the number of pictures Olivia uploaded from her phone, and y represents the number of pictures Olivia uploaded from her camera.

2. Olivia sorted the pictures taken from her camera into 8 different albums, each with the same number of pictures. Let's define a variable n for this number.

3. Now, let's represent this with a new system of equations:

   a) Pictures from camera (original): 35 = y

   b) Pictures from camera (sorted): n * 8 = y

   where original is the number of pictures taking from her camera, and sorted is the number of sorted albums in which she's distributed the camera pics.

   Solving the second equation and placing the result in the first equation, we get:

   a) Pictures from camera (sorted): n * 8 = y

   b) Pictures from camera (original): 8n = 35

4. Now let's bring in what we know about Olivia's uploaded pictures:

   A) Pictures from phone (original): 5 = x

   B) Pictures from camera (sorted): n * 8 = 35

   C) Pictures uploaded: 40 = x + 8n

   

   Substituting ""x"" from step 1 into the second equation:

   A) Pictures from phone (original): 5 = x

   B) Pictures from camera (sorted): 8n = 35 - 5

   C) Pictures uploaded: 40 = (5) + (8n)

   Here, we need to determine a value for ""n"", which is the number of sorted albums (each with the same number of pics).

   Solve for ""n"" in B:

   n = (35 - 5) / 8

   Substitute ""n"" into C:

   C) Pictures uploaded: 40 = 5 + 8 * ((35 - 5) / 8)

   

   Let's clean things up and get our answers:

   A) Pictures from phone (original): 5 = x

   B) Pictures from camera (sorted): ((35 - 5) / 8) = n 

   C) Pictures uploaded: 40 = 5 + 8 * ((35 - 5) / 8)

   So, the number of pictures in each album is n which we found earlier. The final answer is: Each album has ((35 - 5) / 8) = 3.125 pictures.

   {The final answer is: Each album has approximately 4 pictures rounding to the nearest integer. }

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, let's find out how many cookies Robin has in total. We know she has 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies. We can add these two amounts to get the total number of cookies:

   total cookies = 23 chocolate chip cookies + 25 oatmeal cookies

   = 48 cookies

2. Now, we need to find out how many cookies are in each bag. Robin says she's making baggies with 6 cookies in each bag.

3. Next, we can figure out how many chocolate chip cookies Robin can make into baggies. Since there are 6 cookies in each bag, and Robin has a total of 23 chocolate chip cookies, we can divide the total number of chocolate chip cookies by the number of cookies in each bag to find out how many baggies she can make:

   number of baggies (of chocolate chip cookies) = total number of chocolate chip cookies ÷ number of cookies in each bag

   = 23 chocolate chip cookies ÷ 6

   = 3 baggies of chocolate chip cookies

4. We can do the same thing to find out how many baggies Robin can make with the oatmeal cookies. Since there are 6 cookies in each bag, and Robin has a total of 25 oatmeal cookies, we can do:

   number of baggies (of oatmeal cookies) = total number of oatmeal cookies ÷ number of cookies in each bag

   = 25 oatmeal cookies ÷ 6

   = 4 baggies of oatmeal cookies

5. Now we come to the total number of baggies Robin can make. Since she's making baggies with both chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies, we'll add the number of baggies she can make of chocolate chip cookies to the number of baggies she can make of oatmeal cookies to find the total:

   total number of baggies = number of baggies (of chocolate chip cookies) + number of baggies (of oatmeal cookies)

6. Putting all this together, we can now find the final answer. The total number of baggies Robin can make is:

   total number of baggies = 3 baggies of chocolate chip cookies + 4 baggies of oatmeal cookies

   = 7 baggies in total

   {The final answer is: Robin can make a total of 7 baggies.}

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break this down into small steps:

1. Cody originally had $45 in his possession.
2. Cody received $9 more dollars on his birthday, which brings his total to $54. {The final answer is: $54}.
3. Cody then spent $19 on a new game, leaving him with a remaining balance of $35.
4. We can find out how much Cody has now {after buying the game} by subtracting the amount he spent on the game ($19) from the total he had after receiving the extra $9 on his birthday ($35 + $9 = $44). So, Cody has $44 - $19, or $25, remaining after buying the game. {The final answer is: $25}.
5. Alternatively, we can continue solving the problem by finding out how many dollars Cody has altogether after his birthday (including both his original $45 and the $9 he received on his birthday), and then subtracting the amount he spent on the game: $45 + $9 = $54, and then $54 - $19 = $35, which is the remaining balance. Then we can find out how much Cody got for his birthday alone by subtracting his original $45 from his birthday total of $54, or $54 - $45 = $9. {The final answer is: $9}.

{The final answer is: $25}. Or we can just say that Cody now has $25 remaining after buying the game.

So, Cody's brother ! got none of Cody's original $45, but received $9 on Cody's birthday. After Cody spent $19 on a game, ! had $9 remaining, which is the exact same amount he received for Cody's birthday. In other words, ! still has the $9 that he received from Cody's birthday, since Cody spent none of his original $45 and ! didn't receive any additional money. {The final answer is: $9}.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many pictures were uploaded to Facebook in total. We know that Wendy uploaded 22 pictures from her phone and 2 pictures from her camera to Facebook. In total, she uploaded 22 + 2 = 24 pictures from her phone and camera combined.

Now, let's assume that each album contains the same number of pictures. This means that the total number of pictures in all 4 albums is equal to the number of pictures Wendy uploaded to Facebook. Therefore, we can set up an equation to find the number of pictures in each album:

24 (total number of pictures uploaded) = 4 (number of albums) * (number of pictures in each album)

To find the number of pictures in each album, we solve the equation for (number of pictures in each album):

(number of pictures in each album) = 24 ÷ 4

(number of pictures in each album) = 6

Therefore, Wendy has 6 pictures in each of the 4 albums she created on Facebook. The final answer is:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Let's call the number of candies they have left after eating 8 pieces on the first night ""x"". Katie had 8 pieces and her sister had 23.

2. They ate 8 candies in total on the first night, so we subtract those from Katie's and her sister's candy counts:
  - Katie had 8 pieces at the beginning, and she ate 8 pieces on the first night, so now she has 8 - 8 = 0 candies.
  - Her sister had 23 candies at the beginning, and she ate 8 of those on the first night, so now she has 23 - 8 = 15 candies.

3. Putting this together, we can see that after the first night, the total number of candies between Katie and her sister is:
   - Katie has 0 candies.
   - Her sister has 15 candies.
   - So in total, they have 15 candies.

4. But what about the leftover candies? We're looking for ""x"", how many candies did they have left after eating 8 pieces. 

5. We can find this by rearranging the equation from step 3 and solving for ""x"":
   - After eating 8 candies, they have a total of 15 left.
   - We know Katie has 0 candies, so let's call the number of candies her sister has ""y"".
   - So we can write: 15 = 0 + y
   - Since we know her sister has y candies, that's the number of candies that she has left after eating 8 on the first night.
   - Solving for ""y"", we get: y = 15

6. So Katie's sister has all 15 candies left, since Katie has 0 candies left from eating 8 on the first night.

7. To check, if Katie's sister had 15 candies at the end, and there were 15 candies total left between them, that must mean Katie has 0 candies left - which is what we found earlier.

{The final answer is}: If Katie and her sister ate 8 candies on the first night of Halloween, Katie's sister would have 15 candies remaining between them.</s>",23

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to approach it in a systematic and organized way. Here are the steps:

1. Determine the number of puppies remaining after the sales. This can be found by subtracting the number sold from the total.
   - Remaining puppies = 88 (total puppies) - 34 (puppies sold) = 54

2. Calculate the number of cages needed by dividing the remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage, with six puppies per cage.
   - Number of cages needed = 54 (remaining puppies) ÷ 6 (puppies per cage) = 9 (rounded down)

3. To double-check, we can also calculate the number of puppies per cage once we know the number of cages used. In this case, we know there will be six puppies per cage and nine cages in total.
   - Number of puppies per cage = 6 (puppies per cage) × 9 (number of cages) = 54 (total number of puppies remaining)

4. The final answer is the number of cages used, which we determined in step 2.
   - The final answer is 9 cages.

Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. Remaining puppies = 88 (total puppies) - 34 (puppies sold) = 54

2. Number of cages needed = 54 (remaining puppies) ÷ 6 (puppies per cage) = 9

3. Number of puppies per cage = 6 (puppies per cage) × 9 (number of cages) = 54

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
First, let's calculate how many trays Jerry will carry in total. At each table, Jerry will carry a different number of trays. Let's call the number of trays at the first table x, and the number of trays at the second table y. Then, we know that x is less than or equal to 9 (since Jerry picked up all 9 trays from the first table), and y is less than or equal to 7 (since Jerry picked up all 7 trays from the second table).

Jerry will make multiple trips to each table, so let's let n represent the number of trips Jerry makes to the first table, and m represent the number of trips Jerry makes to the second table.

On each trip to the first table, Jerry carries 8 trays. So, in n trips to the first table, Jerry carries a total of 8n trays from the first table.

On each trip to the second table, Jerry carries fewer than or equal to 8 trays, since he is already full from the first table. Let's say he carries y trays on each of m trips to the second table. Then, he carries a total of my trips' worth of trays from the second table.

Adding up the number of trays Jerry carries from both tables, we get:

8n + my = x + y

We know that x is less than or equal to 9, and y is less than or equal to 7. Let's try some guess-and-check to find the possible values of x, y, n, and m that satisfy this system of equations. Here's what we find:

Guess: x = 7, y = 0. Jerry picks up all 7 trays from the first table and then goes back and does not make any further trips to the first table (since there are no more trays to pick up). He carries 7 trays on each of 0 trips to the second table, since there are no trays left at the second table.

In this case, we get:

8n + my = 7 + 0

8n = 7, so n = 1. Jerry makes 1 trip to the first table and does not make any trips to the second table.

Alternatively:

Guess: x = 8, y = 0. Jerry picks up every tray from the first table, so he makes 1 trip to the first table and does not make any additional trips to the first table. There are no trays left at the second table, so he does not make any trips to the second table.

In this case, we get:

8n + my = 8 + 0

8n = 8, so n = 1. Jerry makes 1 trip to both tables and does not make any additional trips to either table.

Alternatively:

Guess: x = 9, y = 0. Jerry picks up every tray from the first table and does not make any additional trips to the first table. Since there are no trays left at the second table, he does not make any trips to the second table.

In this case, we get:

8n + my = 9 + 0

8n = 9, so n = 1. Jerry makes 1 trip to the first table and does not make any additional trips to either table.

Alternatively:

Guess: x = 8, y = 1. Jerry picks up 8 out of 9 trays from the first table, and then he makes 7 trips (each carrying 1 tray) to the second table to pick up the remaining 7 trays from that table.

In this case, we get:

8n + my = 8 + 7

8n + 7my = 15

8n = 15 - 7m

To satisfy this equation (i.e., have Jerry pick up all the trays! ), we need n to be 1, which means that Jerry makes 1 trip to the first table. We already know that m is less than or equal to 7, since we've picked up all the trays at the second table. Based on our understanding of this system of equations, we can find specific values for n, m, x, and y that work as follows:

n = 1

We know that the sum of the trips to both tables is the same for both cases, so let's use a",2

To find the total number of carrots Megan has, we need to add the number of carrots she had after the first day (which we'll find first) and the number of carrots she picked on the second day.

After the first day: 
Megan picked 19 carrots on the first day, so she had 19 carrots at the end of the first day.
She threw away 4 of those carrots, which means she had 15 carrots left.
The number of carrots Megan had after the first day is the number of carrots she had when she initially picked them plus the number of carrots she threw away, and then subtracting the number of carrots she threw away:
19 - 4 = 15 carrots

Next day: 
On the second day, Megan picked 46 more carrots.
We add this number to the number of carrots she had at the end of the first day to find the total number of carrots she had at the end of the second day:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Let's keep track of the total number of files Wendy had before deleting any. We are given that she had 82 files, so our initial total is 82.

2. Wendy deleted 37 files, so we need to subtract 37 from our initial total to obtain the number of files she has left. Mathematicaly, we can write this as:

    82 - 37 = x

3. From the problem, we know that Wendy put all the files left into folders with 5 files in each one. We want to find the number of folders required to hold all those files. At the outset, let's call this number 'y'.

4. Every folder Wendy created will have 5 files inside it, and Wendy created 'y' number of folders. Now we apply the multiplication concept to find how many files will be there in total as a result of creating 'y' number of folders having '5' number of files.

   Hence, the number of files inside these y folders would be '5'*'y' files.

5. Let's compare the number of files Wendy has left after deletion (x) with the number of files she's created by arranging them in y number of folders with 5 files each (5*y).

   5*y = x

   Using our understanding of multiplication, we've come to an equivalent statement that ""the product of 5 and y is equal to x, the total number of files after deleting.""

6. Now we use the variables we have set up so far and our understanding of algebra to find out the relationship between  x, y and 82.

   82 = x + 37

   82 - 37 = x

   82 - 37 = 5*y

   1. Rearrange the variables to isolate the y.

      By subtracting 82 from both sides, we have:

      45 = 5*y

      Then, by dividing both sides by 5, we have:

      y = 9

   2. Now let's replace our expression for 'x' (which we found in step 2) with the new expression for 'y' we just derived:

      x = 82 - 37

      From step 5, we can write:

      5*9 = 82 - 37

      Simplifying, we get:

      45 = 47

      Which is obviously false. There must have been an error in the problem, and it's possible that the number of files Wendy deleted was mistakenly written as 37 when it should have been something else.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the number of new players and returning players in variables. Let's call the number of new players x and the number of returning players y.

We are given that the total number of players is 12 + 44, or 56. So x + y = 56.

Now, let's call the number of groups k. We want to find k such that each group has 8 players.

Let n be the number of players in one group. Since each group has 8 players, n = 8.

We know that the total number of players is k times the number of players in one group, or k times 8. So k times 8 is 56, which is x + y.

Let's write this as an equation: 8k = x + y

We already know x and y from the information we were given. X is the number of new players, and y is the number of returning players.

Let's substitute x and y into our equation: 8k = 12 + 44

Now we can solve for k by manipulating this equation. We can separate the number of new players and returning players by subtracting x from both sides:

8k - x = 44

We can simplify this by factoring out k on the left side:

8(k - 5.5) = 44

Now we can find k by dividing both sides by 36. This gives us:

k = 44 / 3

So the number of groups is approximately 12.89, or around 13 groups.

Here's a breakdown of the math above:

- We represent the number of new players with a variable x.
- We represent the number of returning players with a variable y.
- We know that the total number of players is 56, so we write that as an equation: x + y = 56.
- We represent the number of players in each group as n, and we know that n = 8.
- We represent the number of groups as k.
- We write an equation for the number of players in the entire team: k times the number of players in each group, or k times 8.
- Finally, we solve for k in the equation we created.


{The final answer is around 13 groups, although this assumes that each group has 8 players exactly. Realistically, some groups may have slightly more or less than 8 players, so the exact number of groups could vary slightly.}</s>",7

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations, which is the number of ways we can choose a subset of elements from a larger set. In this case, we are finding the number of ways we can choose 21 carrots from a set containing some remaining carrots.

Let's find the number of carrots remaining after Nancy threw out 2 of the original 12.

Nancy picked 12! carrots, which is equivalent to 12 x 11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1. Some of these carrots were thrown out, so we need to adjust for that. After throwing out 2 carrots, we're left with 10.

Nancy has a choice of selecting these remaining 10 carrots to fill the remainder of the first day's picking. This can be represented as C(10, 21), which is the number of ways we can choose 21 carrots from a set containing 10 (after throwing out the original 2).

Finally, on the second day, Nancy picks another 21 carrots. We represent this set as C(10, 21) because Nancy still has 10 carrots remaining (after throwing out the original 2 from the first day's picking) for the second day's picking.

To find the total number of carrots picked, we add the number of carrots picked on both days (ignoring the carrots that were thrown out on both days).

Total number of carrots: 12! - 2 + C(10, 21) + C(12, 21)

Simplifying, we know that: C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)

Substituting the values, we get:

Total number of carrots: 12! / ((10-21)! * (12-2)!* (10)!* (2)!) + 12 * C(10, 21) * (10)! / ((21-21)! * (12-21)!)

The first term in the equation above represents the leftover carrots from the first day. The second term represents the remaining carrots after throwing out 2 from the second day's picking. The answer is:

Total number of carrots = 12 * (10 * 19 * 18 * 17 * 16) / (2! * 8!) + 12 * (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / ((21 - 21)! * (2 - 21)! * (12 - 21)!)

To find an approximate value for the total number of carrots (using a calculator), we get:

Total number of carrots {The final answer is}: 5,461 roughly.

Let's represent the unknown amount of money Roger currently has by x.

Given information:
1. Roger originally had 16 dollars.
2. Roger received 28 dollars more for his birthday.
3. Roger spent 25 dollars on a new game.

Let's represent the amount of money Roger received for his birthday by b. This leads to an expression for the total amount of money Roger has now in terms of x:

x = 16 (Roger's original money) + b (the money he obtained for his birthday) - 25 (the amount he spent on the new game).

Using the total value in terms of b and x, we can substitute this into our given equation for the amount Roger received for his birthday:

x = 16 + b - 25

Now, we're going to solve for b in terms of x:

x = 16 + b - 25
x - 16 = b - 25

b = x - 16 + 25

Now, we can substitute this back into our original equation for x:

x = 16 + b - 25
x = 16 + (x - 16 + 25) - 25
x = x - 9

Let's simplify this expression:

9 = 2x

x = 9/2

Substituting our value for x back into either the original equation or the simplified equation for x, we get:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:

1. Let's define some variables to help us keep track of the number of bags and cans collected.
   - n represents the number of bags filled on Saturday.
   - k represents the number of bags filled on Sunday.
   - x represents the number of cans in each bag filled on Saturday.
   - y represents the number of cans in each bag filled on Sunday.

2. We know that Sam filled 3 bags on Saturday, so n = 3.

3. We also know that x is the number of cans in each bag filled on Saturday, and there are 9 cans in each bag. Therefore, x = 9.

4. Let's represent the number of cans in Sam's first 3 bags as 9n, since each of those 3 bags contains 9 cans.

5. In total, Sam put 3 bags in the recycling bin on Saturday, so we can now represent the total number of cans he put in the bin on Saturday as follows.

   Total number of cans on Saturday = 9n

6. On Sunday, Sam filled an additional k bags. Let's call y the number of cans in one of these bags.

7. We can now calculate the total number of cans put in the bin on Sunday as follows.

   Total number of cans on Sunday = ky

8. Adding the number of cans collected on Saturday and Sunday, we have the total number of cans collected.

   Total number of cans collected = (9n) + (ky)

9. Now it's time to write your answer in a clear and concise way. End your solution with a statement indicating the final answer.

   To summarize, Sam collected a total of (9n) + (ky) cans, where n is the number of bags filled on Saturday, k is the number of bags filled on Sunday, and y is the number of cans in each bag filled on Sunday. Hence, {The final answer is} (9n) + (ky) cans.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for part-whole relationships, which is part = whole x rate. In this case, we can think of the worksheets as the whole, the problems as the part, and the rate as the number of problems per worksheet.

Let's represent the number of problems on a single worksheet as p, the number of worksheets the teacher has as w, and the number of problems the teacher has already graded as x.

First, let's find the value of p:

4 problems are on one worksheet, so p = 4

Next, let's find the value of x. The teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, so we can think of 8 worksheets as 8 parts of a whole, where the whole is the total number of problems the teacher has graded:

8 worksheets have a total of 32 problems (8 worksheets with 4 problems per worksheet). So, the number of problems the teacher has already graded is:

x = w x rate
x = 32 problems

Since we have already found the value of x, let's find the value of w. The teacher has a total of 16 worksheets, so we can think of 16 worksheets as 16 parts of a whole, where the whole is the total number of worksheets:

16 worksheets have a total of 64 problems (16 worksheets with 4 problems per worksheet). So, the total number of worksheets is:

w = problems divided by rate
w = 64 worksheets

Now, we can use what we know to find how many more problems the teacher still needs to grade. Since we know that the teacher has already graded x = 32 problems and still has w - x = 64 - 32 = 32 more worksheets to grade, we can find the number of additional problems by thinking of those remaining 32 worksheets as 32 parts of a whole, where the whole is the total number of problems remaining:

(w - x) worksheets have a total of (w - x) p problems (32 worksheets with 4 problems per worksheet). So, the number of additional problems is:

(w - x) p problems
(64 - 32) x 4 problems
32 x 4 = 128 problems

So, the teacher still needs to grade 128 more problems, for a total of 160 problems. The final answer is:

The final answer is 160 problems.</s>",32

To find the total number of winter clothing items that Paige has, we need to first calculate the number of scarves and the number of mittens that she has, because we know that there are 6 boxes, each containing 5 scarves and 5 mittens.

Number of scarves = 6 boxes * 5 scarves per box = 30 scarves

Number of mittens = 6 boxes * 5 mittens per box = 30 mittens

Now that we know how many scarves and mittens Paige has, we can add the number of scarves and mittens to get the total number of winter clothing pieces she has.

Total winter clothing pieces = Number of scarves + Number of mittens

Total winter clothing pieces = 30 scarves + 30 mittens

{The final answer is} 60 winter clothing pieces. 

Therefore, Paige has a total of 60 winter clothing pieces, which is equal to the 30 scarves and 30 mittens that she has found in the 6 boxes.</s>",60

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of remaining work and its law of diminishing returns.

Let's say the chef has cooked 6 potatoes, and he needs to cook another 6 potatoes to reach his total of 12. The total number of potatoes he needs to cook is 12 (given). The total number of potatoes he has already cooked is 6 (given), so the remaining number of potatoes to be cooked is 12 - 6 = 6.

The chef spends 6 minutes cooking each potato (given). Suppose it takes x minutes to cook the remaining 6 potatoes, then we have:

Total time = Time taken to cook the first 6 + Time taken to cook the remaining 6

Total time = 6 * 6 + 6 * x

Total time = 36 + 36 * x / 6

Total time = 72 + 6 * x / 6

Total time = 72 + x

To find the value of x, we plug the given constraints into our equation and solve for x:

Total time = 72 + x

x = Total time - 72

Substituting the given data:

Total time = 360 * 6 (minutes spent on the first 6 potatoes) + (12 - 6) * x (remaining minutes spent on the additional 6 potatoes)

Total time = 216 + 6 * x

Total time = 216 + x

Now we have a system of equations:

72 + x = Total time

x = Total time - 72

Simplifying the second equation:

Total time - 72 = Total time - 72

Total time = Total time

Hence, the second equation is a restatement of the first equation. The first equation is more useful since it has x variable, which we are solving for.

We can now eliminate one of these equations and have just one equation, which contains only one variable. We can use either the first equation (72 + x = Total time) or the second equation (x = Total time - 72). 

In this case, let's eliminate the first equation and proceed with the second equation:

x = Total time - 72

We can now substitute x = Total time - 72 into the first equation to make the first equation dependent on the second equation (to eliminate the redundancy). Using this substitution, we get:

72 + Total time - 72 = Total time

Total time = Total time

There is a clear contradiction here. This indicates that we may have an algebraic error or a logical error.

We have simplified our system of equations and have gotten to a state where the two equations are equivalent. The system of equations will only have a unique solution if the equations aren't equivalent. The fact that we end up with a situation where an equation is equal to itself shows us that we might have made a mistake while solving.

Let's go back and check our reasoning and see where we went wrong:

When we were finding x, we ended up with two equations containing x. We tried to eliminate one of these equations and proceed with just one equation, which contained only one variable, and arrived at:

x = Total time - 72

This equation implies that as the total time taken by the chef increases, the remaining time taken to cook the potatoes also increases, but we know that the minimum time taken to cook 12 potatoes is the sum of times taken to cook the first 6 potatoes and the remaining 6 potatoes. That means, as the total time taken by the chef increases, the time taken to cook each potato must decrease because the chef now has more experience under his belt, and thus, is more efficient (law of diminishing returns).

This is a logical contradiction, which doesn't make sense. In reality, if the chef keeps on cooking potatoes for a more extended period, the time taken to cook each potato will remain unchanged, and the total time taken for cooking 12 potatoes will simply increase linearly, i.e., 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

When we look at it in this perspective, we know that the equation:

Total time = 72 + x

Is actually the equation we're looking for. This means that we can directly proceed with the given data to find the value of x.",36

To solve this problem, we can use a two-step approach:

Number of games sold = 39
Number of games left = 57 - 39
Number of games left = 18

Step 2: Since Luke is packing two games into each box, we can determine how many boxes he needs based on the number of games left.

Number of boxes = Number of games left divided by Number of games in each box
Number of boxes = 18 divided by 2
Number of boxes = 9

Thus, we have our final answer:

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of puppies left after selling 7 of them.
Let the total number of puppies be 13.
When 7 puppies were sold, the number of puppies left was:
13 - 7 = 6

Step 2: Find the number of puppies in each cage.
As there are 2 puppies in each cage, we can find the number of cages required to keep all 6 remaining puppies.
Each cage has 2 puppies.
Number of cages required = Number of puppies / Number of puppies per cage
Number of cages required = 6 / 2
Number of cages required = 3

Step 3: Check if the number of cages is reasonable.
3 cages might not be feasible, as we would expect the store to have more than 3 cages for 13 puppies. We may need to assume that some puppies were transferred to other cages when they became crowded, or we may assume that the store has many more cages than indicated in the problem.

Step 4: We will assume that the store had enough cages to accommodate all the puppies.
Let's say, the store had x cages in total.
Number of puppies in each cage = 13 / x

Step 5: We know that each cage has 2 puppies, so:
2 = (13 / x)
13 = 2x
x = 13 / 2
x is approximately 6.5 cages. But since we cannot have decimal places on cages, we may assume that the store had 7 cages with 1 or 2 puppies in each cage.

Final Answer: {The store had 7 cages with approximately 1.86 puppies in each cage, with the remaining puppies perhaps being temporarily housed elsewhere in the store or transferred to different locations.}</s>",3

                     Faye and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Faye picked 23 ? and her mother picked 5. If only 12 of the carrots , were good, how many bad carrots did they have? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's call the number of bad carrots x. 

Faye picked 23 more carrots than her mother, so we can set up an equation:

Faye's number of carrots = 23 more than her mother's number of carrots
Faye's number of carrots = her mother's number of carrots + 23

Let's call Faye's mother's number of carrots m.

Faye's number of carrots = m + 23

We also know that out of Faye's carrots (m + 23), only 12 were good. So, we can set up an equation for the number of good carrots in Faye's haul:

Number of good carrots in Faye's haul = 12

But Faye's haul is m + 23, so we can set up another equation:

Number of good carrots in Faye's haul = (m + 23) * (number of good carrots per carrot) = 12

Let's call the number of good carrots per carrot g.

(m + 23) * g = 12

Now, we also know that the total number of carrots they picked is (m + 23) + 5. Let's call that total number of carrots t.

t = (m + 23) + 5

Also, we know that out of all the carrots picked, only 12 were good. Again, we can set up an equation:

Number of good carrots = 12

But this time, the total number of carrots is t. Our final equation looks like this:

Number of good carrots = t * (number of good carrots per carrot) = 12

Putting everything together, we have three equations and three unknowns: m, g, and t. Let's solve for them using a method like Gaussian elimination.

It turns out that m = -11, g = 1, and t = 28 is an answer that satisfies all the equations. Note that since we assumed that m is a positive number, having a negative value of m doesn't make much sense here (Faye's mother would need to have picked a negative number of carrots). To get practical results, you would want to adjust the problem to make it more realistic.

Finally, to calculate the number of bad carrots, we can plug our solution back into one of the equations:

Number of bad carrots = (m + x) - (number of good carrots)

Let's assume that the number of good carrots in Faye's haul was 12. Then, the number of good carrots they picked in total (from the solution above) is 12. Plugging these into our equation above gives us:

Number of bad carrots = (m + x) - 24

Now, we can plug in our solutions for m and g to get:

Number of bad carrots = (-11 + x) - 24 = x - 13

Finally, we can find out how many bad carrots there are by finding x:

Number of bad carrots = x - 13

Number of bad carrots = (they picked) bad carrots + (Faye's mother picked) bad carrots = x - 13

Faye's mom picked 5 bad carrots (which is the 5 we were originally given), so:

Number of bad carrots = x - 8

Solving for x:

Number of bad carrots = 26 - x

Number of bad carrots = 0 - x

Number of bad carrots = -x

Now, since we're looking for the actual number of bad carrots, we can't have a negative number of bad carrots. If we assume that the number of bad carrots is non-negative, we would want to adjust the problem to ensure this, such as limiting the number of bad carrots that can be picked, or assuming that Faye's mom knows how to pick perfectly good carrots.

<|assistant|>
Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers originally picked by Isabel.
66 flowers were picked by Isabel for the wedding. We'll represent this as x.

Step 2: Determine the number of flowers that wilted before the wedding.
10 flowers wilted before the wedding. Let's represent this as y.

Step 3: Calculate the number of flowers that are still usable for making bouquets.
The number of usable flowers is the difference between the total number of flowers and the number that wilted.
(x - y) flowers are still usable for making bouquets.

Step 4: Determine the number of bouquets that can be made from the remaining flowers.
Since Isabel makes 8 bouquets with each set of 8 flowers, the number of bouquets that can be made from (x - y) flowers is (x - y) / 8.

Step 5: Putting all the steps together, the final answer to the problem can be calculated.
She could still make {(x - y) / 8} bouquets from the remaining flowers.

Step 6: Simplify the expression for finding the number of bouquets from the remaining flowers.
(x - y) / 8 = (66 - y) / 8

Step 7: Substitute the values of x and y to find out the number of bouquets that can be made.
Let's replace x with 66 and y with 10 in step 6.
She could still make {(66 - 10) / 8} bouquets from the remaining flowers.

The final answer is: {(56) / 8} = 7 bouquets.

Therefore, Isabel could still make 7 bouquets from the remaining flowers despite 10 of them wilting before the wedding.</s>",7

To solve this problem, we first need to find how many tickets Oliver used on the Ferris wheel and how many tickets he used on the bumper cars.

Oliver rode the Ferris wheel 5 times, so the number of tickets he used for the Ferris wheel is 5 times the cost of a single ride. Each ride on the Ferris wheel cost 7 tickets, so the total number of tickets Oliver used for the Ferris wheel is 35 tickets (5 rides at a cost of 7 tickets each).

Oliver rode the bumper cars 4 times, so the number of tickets he used on the bumper cars is also 4 times the cost of a single ride. Each ride on the bumper cars cost 7 tickets, so the total number of tickets Oliver used for the bumper cars is 28 tickets (4 rides at a cost of 7 tickets each).

Adding the number of tickets Oliver used on the Ferris wheel and the number of tickets he used on the bumper cars, we get a total of 63 tickets used (35 tickets for the Ferris wheel and 28 tickets for the bumper cars).

To summarize, we can say that Oliver used a total of 63 tickets, as each ride on the Ferris wheel and the bumper cars cost 7 tickets. Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is 63 tickets.}</s>",63

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find how many minutes it took Wendy to finish assembling all of the new furniture, we need to first figure out how many pieces of furniture she purchased in total. Let's represent the number of chairs with the variable ""chairs"" and the number of tables with the variable ""tables.""

The number of chairs Wendy bought is 4, and the number of tables she bought is also 4. So, we can write this in an equation:

chairs = 4
tables = 4

Next, we know that Wendy spent 6 minutes on each piece of furniture, so the total number of minutes she spent on the chairs is 24 (6 minutes times 4 chairs) and the total number of minutes she spent on the tables is also 24 (6 minutes times 4 tables).

We can represent these numbers with variables as well. Let ""chair_time"" represent the number of minutes Wendy spent on each chair, and let ""table_time"" represent the number of minutes she spent on each table. Here's how we'd write this:

chair_time = 6
table_time = 6

Now we can calculate the total time Wendy spent on all the chairs and tables. The total time spent on the chairs is:

chair_time * chairs

We can also calculate the total time spent on the tables:

table_time * tables

Let's add these two numbers to get the total number of minutes Wendy spent assembling everything:

total_time = chair_time * chairs + table_time * tables

Let's calculate each of these steps to find the total time Wendy spent:

total_time = 6 * 4 + 6 * 4
total_time = 24 + 24
total_time = 48 

So, Wendy spent a total of 48 minutes assembling all of her new furniture. Here's the whole process, step by step:

chairs = 4
tables = 4
chair_time = 6
table_time = 6

total_time = chair_time * chairs + table_time * tables
total_time = 6 * 4 + 6 * 4
total_time = 24 + 24
total_time = 48

The final answer is: Wendy spent a total of 48 minutes assembling all of her new furniture.</s>",48

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of games that do work by the variable x. Then, the number of games that don't work is 74, which means the total number of games obtained by Ned is 50 + 27 + 74 = 121. Let's subtract the broken games from this total:

121 - 74 = x

So, we want to solve the equation x - 74 = 121 - (50 + 27), which is equivalent to x - 94 = 121 - 77. Adding 94 to both sides, we obtain x = 215. Thus, Ned ended up with 215 good games.

Final answer: Ned has 215 good games in his collection.

Note: We used the variable ! to represent all 50 games bought from the friend, and we used the variable ? to represent the 27 games bought at the garage sale because the problem didn't specify the types of games in either case.</s>",3
" A pet store had 38 siamese cats and 25 house : cats. During a sale , they sold 45 cats. How many cats do they have left? ","<|user|>

                    question:
                     A pet store had 38 siamese cats and 25 house : cats. During a sale , they sold 45 cats. How many cats do they have left? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find out how many cats are left, we need to break the problem into smaller steps.

1. Before the sale, there were 38 Siamese cats. Let's call the total number of cats at this point X. We can write an equation to represent this:

    38 = X – 38 (subtracting the number of Siamese cats from the total number of cats)

2. We also know that there were 25 house cats (non-Siamese). Again, let's call the total number of cats X. We can write:

    X = 25 + 38 (adding the numbers of house cats and Siamese cats)

3. After the sale, there are 45 fewer cats than before the sale. Call this number D. We need to find D.

    45 = X – (X – 38 – 45) (using the formula for finding the difference between numbers)

    45 = X – X + 38 – 45 (factoring out X)

    0 = –17 (subtracting X from both sides)

    Since negative answers don’t make sense in this context, this equation can’t be correct. We made a mistake in Step 3 because our calculation for D was wrong. Looking back at the facts, during the sale, they sold 45 cats, some of which were Siamese and some were house cats. We don’t know how many of each, so we can’t calculate D.

    4. Let's assume for now that all of the cats sold were house cats. In that case, we would subtract the original 25 house cats from the 45 sold to find the difference:

    D = 45 - 25 (house cats sold)

    D = 20 (house cats remaining)

    We know that all cats sold were house cats, so the remaining house cats will equal the current number of house cats. Now, let's find the total number of cats left.

    5. The total number of cats left is the original number of Siamese cats (which we already know) plus the remaining house cats:

    X = 38 + 20 (total number of cats left)

    X = 58 (total number of cats left)

    We can now find the total number of Siamese cats (X - 38) and the total number of house cats (X - 20) by subtracting the numbers we already know from X.

    Let's summarize our work so far:

            Before the sale: 
            - 38 Siamese cats
            - 25 house cats
            X total cats

            During the sale: 
            - 45 house cats sold
            Y Siamese cats sold
            D total cats sold

            After the sale:
            - X - D total cats left
            - X - Y total Siamese cats left
            - X - D - Y total house cats left

    6. We now know that all the cats sold were house cats. We also know that before the sale, there were a total of X cats, which included 38 Siamese cats and 25 house cats.

    7. During the sale, they sold a total of 45 house cats. Let X - D be the total number of cats left after the sale and let Y be the number of Siamese cats sold during the sale.

    8. The number of Siamese cats left is found by taking the original number of Siamese cats (38) and subtracting the number of Siamese cats sold (Y):

    X - Y = 38 (number of Siamese cats left)

    9. Now, let's find the total number of cats left (X - D).

    X - D = X - 45 + 25 - Y (using the fact that all the cats sold were house cats)

    10. Simplifying the previous equation and solving for X:

    X = 38 + Y - 20 (total number of cats left)

    The X is solved when Y is known. Since we don't know how many Siamese cats were sold, we can't find X. But we know the number of house cats sold, so let's find that:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Find the total number of points earned in the first two rounds (round 1 and round 2).

- Carol earned 17 points in round 1.
- Carol earned 6 points in round 2.
- The total number of points earned in the first two rounds is the sum of the points earned in these rounds.
- Total points earned in the first two rounds = 17 points (from round 1) + 6 points (from round 2) = 23 points.

Step 2: Find the number of points lost in the last round.

- Carol lost 16 points in the last round.

Step 3: Find the net number of points earned in all three rounds (including the loss in the last round).

- The number of points earned in round 1 is 17 points.
- The number of points lost in round 3 is -16 points (note the sign change).
- The net number of points earned in round 2 is the same as in round 2 (i.e., 6 points).
- Adding these, we get:
- Net number of points earned in all three rounds = 17 points (from round 1) - 16 points (loss in round 3) + 6 points (from round 2) = 15 points.

Step 4: Add the total number of points earned in the first two rounds (23 points) to the net number of points earned in all three rounds (15 points) to get the final number of points earned by Carol.

- Final number of points earned: 23 points (from rounds 1 and 2) + 15 points (net number of points earned in round 3) = 38 points in total.

The final answer is: Carol ended the game with 38 points. {The final answer is 38 points}.</s>",7

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to apply addition and subtraction operations.

Let's call the number of pieces of chocolate candy Dave still has as x.

First, we know that there are 12 boxes of chocolate candy purchased by Dave.

Each box contains 3 pieces, so we can find the total number of pieces in these 12 boxes.

12 boxes x 3 pieces in each box = 36 pieces in all

Next, Dave gave 5 boxes of chocolate candy to his little brother.

Now we need to find how many pieces of chocolate candy his little brother received.

Each box contains 3 pieces, and we know he received 5 boxes.

5 boxes x 3 pieces in each box = 15 pieces his little brother received

Now we want to find out how many pieces Dave still had after giving those 5 boxes to his little brother.

The number of pieces Dave still has is the total number of pieces in the remaining 7 boxes.

7 boxes x 3 pieces in each box = 21 pieces that Dave still has

Putting it all together, we know that Dave still has x pieces after giving his little brother the 5 boxes.

The total number of pieces from the remaining 7 boxes should add up to x.

x = 7 boxes x 3 pieces in each box

x = 21 pieces

Putting it all together, we can now determine the number of pieces Dave still has after giving his little brother some candy.

The final answer is 21 pieces. {The final answer is 21 pieces.}

So, Dave still has a total of 21 pieces of chocolate candy after giving his little brother 5 boxes.</s>",21

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Find the number of customers who didn't leave a tip:

The number of customers who didn't leave a tip is 49 out of the total number of customers. Let's call this number x. We can represent this as an equation:

x = 49

2. Find the number of customers who left a tip:

To find the number of customers who left a tip, we need to find the difference between the total number of customers and the number of customers who didn't leave a tip. The total number of customers is the sum of the initial 39 customers and the additional 12 customers during the lunch rush, which is 51.

Let's call the number of customers who left a tip y. We can represent this as an equation:

51 = x + y

3. Eliminate the variable (x) by substituting:

We can substitute the value of x from equation 1 into equation 2 to eliminate the variable x:

51 = 49 + y

4. Simplify the equation:

We can subtract 49 from both sides of the equation to isolate y:

y = 2

5. Find the final answer:

Therefore, the number of customers who left a tip is 2. To find the total number of customers who left a tip, we can add this to the number of customers who didn't leave a tip:

y + x = tip-leaving customers + non-tippers

To calculate the total number of non-tippers, we can subtract the number of tippers from the total number of customers who didn't leave a tip:

Non-tippers = x - y

We can substitute these values into the formula above:

Non-tippers = 49 - 2 = 47

Now we can find the total number of tippers:

Tippers = y = 2

The final answer is: 2 customers left a tip.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Step 1: Understand the problem.

The cafeteria had a total of 50 apples. For lunch, they handed out 5 apples to each student. The remaining apples were used to make pies. Each pie requires 5 apples. The question asks how many pies they could make with the remaining apples.

Step 2: Calculate the number of apples left after lunch.

Let's say the number of students who had lunch is X. Each student receives 5 apples, so the total number of apples given out during lunch is 5X. This means the total number of apples at the cafeteria is now 50 - 5X.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pies that can be made.

Let's say the number of pines made is P. Each pie requires 5 apples, so the total number of apples used to make pies is 5P. This means the remaining number of apples at the cafeteria is 50 - 5X - 5P.

Step 4: Set up an equation.

We can create two equations. Equation 1: The total number of apples at the cafeteria is 50 - 5X. Equation 2: The total number of apples used to make pies is 5P.

Step 5: Solve the system of equations.

Substitute the expression for X in Equation 1 with the expression from the first statement.

50 - 5(the total number of students who ate lunch) = 50 - 5X

Let's say Z is the total number of students who ate lunch. Then, X = Z.

Substitute this into Equation 1:

50 - 5Z = 50 - 5X

Now, let's combine Equation 1 and Equation 2.

50 - 5Z = 50 - 5X

5P = X

This means 5X = P

X = P/5

Now, let's substitute this into Equation 1:

50 - 5(the total number of students who ate lunch) = 50 - 5(P/5)

Zero out the P and X terms. We're left with:

0 = 0

This is a tautology, which is expected since we're not dealing with actual numbers. Therefore, any real number of students and pies can satisfy these simultaneous equations.

Final answer: At this point, we can't determine how many pies they can make.

To provide some insight into this answer, we could do a trial and error. Let's say there were 20 students who ate lunch, which means there were a total of 90 apples left after lunch. If we are making 5-pies, then we require 25 apples to make the pies. The remaining number of apples should be 65. This means we can make 25/5 (i.e., 5) pies. Therefore, the cafeteria can make 5 pies.

The final answer is: They could make 5 pies.

However, the problem, as stated, lacks clarity around whether all students participated. Therefore, the most rational answer would be they could make an undefined number of pies.</s>",9

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first find how many apples were used for lunches before purchasing more. We know that there were 14 apples in the school cafeteria and they used 13 of them for the students' lunches. Therefore, the number of apples used for lunches is 13.

To find the number of apples used for lunch, we can set up an equation:

Let x be the number of apples used for lunches.

x = 13

Now, we can find the number of apples in the cafeteria after using 13 for lunches by adding the number of apples used for lunches (13) to the remaining apples in the cafeteria (14 - 13).

14 - 13 = 1 apple (remaining after using 13 for lunch)

So, the number of apples in the cafeteria after using 13 for lunch is 1 apple.

Next, we know that they then bought 49 more apples after using 13 for lunch. We can represent this situation mathematically by adding 49 to the number of apples in the cafeteria after using 13 for lunch.

1 + 49 = x (where x is the total number of apples remaining in the cafeteria after buying 49 more)

We can also use the value of x from the first equation (x=13) to find the total number of apples remaining in the cafeteria after buying 49 more:

14 - 13 = 1  (apples remaining after using for lunch)

1 + 49 = x     (total apples remaining in the cafeteria after buying 49 more)

To solve this system of equations, we can substitute x (the value 13) from the first equation into the second equation to obtain:

14 - 13 = 1 (apples remaining after using for lunch)

1 + 49 = 13 (the number of apples used for lunch)

Now, let's simplify the second equation:

1 + 49 = 13

49 = 12 (the remaining apples in the cafeteria from the first equation)

So, the total number of apples remaining in the cafeteria after buying 49 more is 12 apples (49 apples bought + 1 apple remaining in the cafeteria after using 13 for lunches equaling 12 apples).

In summary, there are 12 apples in the cafeteria after they bought 49 more apples.

The final answer is 12 apples.

<|assistant|>
To find the total number of winter clothing items that Zoe has, we need to find the total number of scarves and mittens she has. Here's how we can figure this out:

1. Find the total number of scarves:
   - Each box has 4 scarves (8 boxes total).
    - So there are 4 scarves in the first box, 4 scarves in the second box, and so on, for a total of 4 scarves from each of the 8 boxes.
    - The total number of scarves is equal to the number of scarves in all 8 boxes, which is 4 scarves from the first box, plus 4 scarves from the second box, and so on, for a total of 8 times 4 scarves.
    - So the total number of scarves is 32 scarves (8 boxes times 4 scarves each).

2. Find the total number of mittens:
    - Each box has 6 mittens (8 boxes total).
    - So there are 6 mittens in the first box, 6 mittens in the second box, and so on, for a total of 6 mittens from each of the 8 boxes.
    - The total number of mittens is equal to the number of mittens in all 8 boxes, which is 6 mittens from the first box, plus 6 mittens from the second box, and so on, for a total of 8 times 6 mittens.
    - So the total number of mittens is 48 mittens (8 boxes times 6 mittens each).

3. Add the total number of scarves and mittens to find the total number of winter clothing items:
    - In total, Zoe has 32 scarves and 48 mittens.

To solve this problem, let's call the amount Frank and his friend spend together as the total cost, T. Using the given information, we can create a system of equations:

1. Frank spends $7 for each trick deck, so for 3 decks, he spends $21. Let's call this F.

2. His friend spends $7 for each trick deck as well, but he buys 2 decks, so his cost is $14. Let's call this H.

3. The total cost is the sum of Frank and his friend's individual costs. So T = F + H.

Substituting F and H into the equation above:

T = 21 + 14

T = 35

The final answer is T = 35 dollars. 

In other words, Frank and his friend spent a total of $35 on trick decks, where Frank bought 3 decks and his friend bought 2 decks. {The final answer is $35 dollars.}</s>",35

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many shirts Sam had washed in total by the time school started. We know that Sam had washed 29 shirts, and we also know the total number of short sleeve shirts he had washed. Let's call this number x.

40 short sleeve shirts washed by Sam at the school = x

We also know that Sam had washed 23 long sleeve shirts before school. Let's call the number of these shirts that were washed again by the time school started y.

23 long sleeve shirts washed before school = y

Let's find x and y.

We can see that some of the short sleeve shirts were also washed again before school. Let's call this number z. By the end of washing, Sam had washed z short sleeve shirts and y long sleeve shirts again.

z short sleeve shirts were washed again = y

Remembering that the total number of shirts Sam had washed by the time school started should be equal to the number he had washed before school and the new shirts he washed this morning.

Let's create a system of equations that will help us calculate the unknowns.

40 - x = w (number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash)
23 - y = l (number of long sleeve shirts he didn't wash)

Now let's find w and l.

z short sleeve shirts were washed again = y

To get z, we subtract the number of short sleeve shirts he didn't wash (w) from the total number of short sleeve shirts he had washed (x).

z = x - w

y long sleeve shirts were washed again = z

To get y, we find z, the number of short sleeve shirts Sam washed again.

z = x - w
y = z
y = x - w

Now let's replace z with the expression x-w and see how it looks.

y = (x - w)

If x is 40 and w is 16, then y is 11 because 40 - 16 = 24, so 24 - 11 = 13.

The equation for the remaining number of shirts for both types is:

40 - x = w
23 - (x - 11) = l

We can now use algebra to find the values of w and l.

40 - x = w
23 - (x - 11) = l

Rearrange the first equation:

x = 40 - w

Now find w to find x:

w = 40 - x

Use it to replace x in the second equation:

23 - (40 - x - 11) = l

Using a bit of algebra:

l = 23 - 29

Therefore:

w = 40 - 24 = 16

l = 23 - 29 = -6

Since we know that w and l can't be negative, the last result isn't valid. As a result, there's an error somewhere, so we can't calculate the exact number of shirts Sam didn't wash.

The final answer is: we don't know the exact number of shirts Sam didn't wash.

" A waiter had 47 : customers to wait on. If 41 customers left and he got another 20 customers, how many customers would he have? ","<|user|>

                    question:
                     A waiter had 47 : customers to wait on. If 41 customers left and he got another 20 customers, how many customers would he have? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the number of customers the waiter originally had as x, and use algebra to set up an equation and solve for the unknown value.

At the beginning, we have 47 customers and the waiter has to serve them, so we can set up the equation x = 47 : 1. This notation means 47 customers per waiter, or a ratio of 47 to 1.

After 41 customers leave, we're left with x - 41 customers. When those 41 customers have left, the remaining number of customers (x - 41) is the quotient when we divide by the number of waiters (which is still 1). So, we can set up another equation: (x - 41) = (x - 41) : 1.

We know that the waiter then gains another 20 customers, so the total number of customers is now (x - 41) + 20. This equation represents the number of customers after the new group arrives, divided by the total number of waiters.

We want to find out the number of customers now that the original calculation and newly gained customers are taken into account. To do this, we can use the new total number of customers (calculated above) and find the number of waiters needed to serve them. This will give us the quotient (x) and the answer we're looking for. Here's the algebra:

x - 41 = (x - 41) : 1
x - 41 = (x - 41) / 1
Multiplying both sides by 1:
x - 41 = x - 41

Adding the 20 new customers:
x - 41 + 20 = (x - 41) + 20 / x
This is the equation we set up to represent the number of customers at the end.

We can now find the quotient, which is the number of waiters needed to serve these customers. If there are x customers and we are interested in the number of waiters, we can set up the equation x = : waiters.

Finally, we combine the two equations we just set up: x = (x - 41 + 20) : waiters

This is our final set of equations:

x - 41 = (x - 41) : 1
x - 41 + 20 = (x - 41) + 20 : x
x = (x - 41 + 20) : x (This is our final set of equations)

To find an answer for x, we substitute everything that's not x into the final equation:

x = (x - 41 + 20) : x

We're looking for x, so we want to solve for that variable. To do that, we set up a simpler form of the equation:

0 = 1 - (41 + 20) / x

Now, we want to isolate x. To do this, we can subtract 1 from both sides and then divide both sides by (-1) since we took the negative of both sides of the equality to get our new form:

x = (41 + 20)

Now, we can plug the values of the lost and gained customers into our simplified form:

x = 61

Finally, we have our answer with step-by-step reasoning. The number of customers is 61, and this can be confirmed by plugging x back into our original equations:

x = 61

x - 41 = 20

Combine:

61 - 41 = 20

20 = 20

Both of these equations hold true for x = 61.</s>",26
