<|assistant|>
Step 1: Identify the given information and unknown variables.

Paige had 11 : songs ! on her mp3 player.
Let ""o"" represent the number of old songs and ""n"" represent the number of new songs.
After deleting o old songs, let ""s"" represent the total number of songs on her mp3 player.

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the variable before and after deleting old songs.

Number of songs before deleting old songs = Number of songs after deleting old songs + Number of old songs deleted

11 : ! = s - o + o

Step 3: Eliminate o by doing subtraction to the first equation and addition to the second equation.

11 = s + o

s = 11 - o

s - o = 11 - o

Step 4: Incorporate the number of new songs.

s - o = 8 + n

Step 5: Substitute the value obtained from step 3 to eliminate o.

11 - (11 - n - 8) = n

Step 6: Combine like terms.

n + 3 = 11

Step 7: Isolate n.

n = 11 - 3

n = 8

Step 8: Identify the final answer.

Let's call it {The final answer is}

After deleting 9 old songs and adding 8 new songs, Paige has a total of 8 songs on her mp3 player.

"!  There were , 39 girls ? and 4 boys ? trying out for the ! schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called ; back, how many students ? didn't make the cut? ","<|user|>

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Let x be the number of students who didn't make the cut. We want to find x, so we'll treat it as an unknown.

2. We know that a total of 43 students (39 girls and 4 boys) tried out for the basketball team. We can represent this relationship using an equation:
   x + 26 = 43 (The total number of students who tried out is 43.)

3. Of the 43 students who tried out, 26 got called back. Let y be the number of students who were called back. Here's the relationship:
   y = 26 (The number of students who got called back is 26.)

4. Some of the students who tried out were called back, and some weren't. We can represent this relationship by subtracting the number of students who got called back from the total who tried out:
   y = 39 - x + 4 (! Schools, so 39 girls, but only 4 boys tried out.)

5. Combining Steps 2 and 4 and solving for x, we get:
   x + 26 = 43
   y = 39 - x + 4
   Substitute y into the second equation and simplify:
   26 = 39 - x + 4
   22 = -x
   The solution is negative, but -x is the number of students who didn't get called back. The final answer is:
   x = 22 (The number of students who didn't get called back is 22.) {The final answer is 22.}</s>",17,17.0,22.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's represent the total number of apples in the cafeteria after buying the additional 6 apples as x. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

23 apples (initial stock) - 20 apples (used for lunch) = x apples (remaining stock after buying more) - 6 apples (these newly bought apples)

Simplifying this equation, we obtain:

23 - 20 = x - 6

Let's isolate the variable x on the left side:

x = 23 + 6 - 20

Substituting the numeric values, we get:

x = 29 - 20

We can continue simplifying this expression:

x = 9

And there's the result:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we'll use the given information and set up a system of equations to find the unknown variables.

Let's start by labeling the unknown variables:

- n = number of enemies defeated
- m = number of enemies left after destroying some of them
- p = final points earned

We know that each enemy defeated gives us 9 points, so we can write:

n pointed earned: 9 points per enemy

Next, let's write down what we know about the total number of enemies in the level and how many we're left with:

11 enemies total: m + n = 11

And finally, let's write down the relationship between how many enemies we destroy versus how many we leave behind:

x enemies destroyed: n = 11 - m

Combining these three equations, we can set up our system:

9n = p                             (number of points earned)
11 = m + n                          (total number of enemies)
x = 11 - m                           (number of enemies destroyed)

Let's solve for n and m first:

n = 11 - m                          (eq. 3)

Substitute this into eq. 2:

11 = m + (11 - m)                          (eq. 2)

Simplify:

11 = 2m                               (eq. 4)

From eq. 4, we can find m:

m = 11/2                               (eq. 5)

Now we can go back to eq. 3 and substitute the value of m we got from eq. 5:

n = 11 - 11/2                            (eq. 6)

Simplify:

n = 11(2-1/2)                           (eq. 7)

Finally, we can substitute the values of n and m into eq. 1 to find p:

p = 9n                                 (eq. 1)

Substitute eq. 7:

p = 9(11)(2-1/2)                          (eq. 8)

Simplify:

p = 198                                   (eq. 9)

Adding a bit of clarity, our final answer is:

{The final answer is 198 points earned for defeating (n=11(2-1/2)) enemies and leaving behind m=(11/2) enemies in the level.}</s>",72,72.0,2.0
" Megan , earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she . had 14 bags, . but didn't recycle 5 of them, how many ; points would she have earned? ","<|user|>

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Megan , earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she . had 14 bags, . but didn't recycle 5 of them, how many ; points would she have earned? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Step 1: Determine how many bags Megan recycled. Since she had 14 bags and didn't recycle 5 of them, she recycled 14 - 5 = 9 bags.

Step 2: Calculate the number of points Megan earned from recycling. Each bag earned Megan 8 points, so she earned 8 points for each of the 9 bags she recycled, for a total of 72 recycling points (9 * 8 = 72).

Step 3: Determine Megan's total number of points without the points earned from recycling. We know from the problem that Megan had 14 bags. Megan earned points for each bag, whether she recycled it or not. Let's represent the number of points Megan earned per bag as one variable x, as this will make it easier to calculate her total points without her recycling points. So, Megan earned x points per bag, and she had 14 bags, so she earned 14x points for her non-recycling activities.

Step 4: Add up Megan's points from recycling and her non-recycling points. We can represent her total number of points using the variable t. Therefore t = 72 + 14x.

Step 5: Use the original statement to connect the total number of points (t) to the number of bags she recycled (9). Since each bag of cans earned Megan 8 points, the 9 bags of cans that she recycled must have earned her 72 points. This means that when adding up her points from everything (recycling and non-recycling), the number of points she earned from recycling (72) should be subtracted. So we have, t = 8x + 72.

Step 6: Now we have two equations for two variables, t (total points) and x (points per bag). We can eliminate one of these variables by subtracting equation 4 from 5: (t = 8x + 72) - (t = 72 + 14x). This results in:

            - 72               - 14x
            - 8x              - 14x
            ->         - 6x

Step 7: To find the number of points earned per bag, we substitute t=0 into equation 6 and solve for x: -6x = 0, so x = 0. This tells us that Megan earned 0 points per non-recycling bag. However, since we know Megan earned 8 points per bag of cans, it follows that each of the 5 bags she didn’t recycle did not earn her any points, and the rest of the bags she recycled earned her 8 points each.

Step 8: We now have enough information to calculate Megan's total number of points. Putting all the information together, we use equation 4, where t is the total number of points for Megan and 14 is the total number of bags she had:

             t = 72 + 14x
             t = 72 + 14(0)
             t = 72.

Step 9: Conclude. Our problem has been reduced to an equation that lets us calculate Megan's total number of points: t = 72. At this point, our problem is complete, and if needed, we may replace ""t = 72"" with ""The final answer is 72."" Alternatively, we can calculate Megan's exact earnings for each bag depending on whether she recycled them or not, in which case our final step would indicate that she earned 8 points per bag that she recycled and zero points per bag that she did not recycle. 

Final Answer: 

            If Megan had 14 bags, earned 8 points for each bag she recycled, and didn't recycle 5 of them, she would have a total of 72 points.

            Therefore, we can conclude that she earned 8 points for each of the 9 bags she recycled, and she did not earn any points for the 5 bags she did not recycle.
             


            Alternatively, If we substitute 't' in the equation t=72 with 'The final answer is', to indicate our complete answer to the problem:

            The final answer is 72.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     ! April's discount ; flowers was . having a ; sale where : each rose was : 4 ! dollars. If April started with 13 . roses , and . had . 4 ! roses left, how much money did she ! earn? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find April's total earnings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the original price of each rose before the discount.
    April sold each rose for $4 after the discount. Without the discount, we use the formula for compound interest (a.k.a. Discount formula)
    Original price = (discounted price / (1 - discount rate))
    Substituting the given values, we get
    Original price of each rose = (4$ / (1 - 0)) = $4

2. Find the number of roses that April sold during the sale.
    Let x be the number of roses that April sold.
    Starting with 13 roses, and with 4! roses left, we have
    Number of roses sold = 13 - 4!(x-1)
    Substituting the formula for calculating 4!
    Number of roses sold = 13 - (x-1)(x)(x-2)(x-3)

3. Find the total earnings from selling the roses.
    Total earnings from selling roses = price per rose * number of roses sold
    Substituting the formulas from steps 1 and 2:
    Total earnings from selling roses = $4 * [13 - (x-1)(x)(x-2)(x-3)] dollars

4. Add April's earnings from flowers that were not sold.
    Let y be the number of flowers that were not sold (in units of 100).
    Since April started with 13 roses and ended up with 4! roses left, the change in roses (change in qty) is -(4!(x-1))
    The change in flowers (change in qty) is -y.
    Using the formula for total change in quantity: Change in Total Quantity = Change in Quantity (of each type)
    -(4!(x-1)) - y = -(x - 1) * (4!) - 100 * y
    
    Let's find the total number of flowers that April started with.
    Total flowers at the start = Quantity at start + Change in total quantity
    Total flowers at the start = 1300 - (-(x - 1) * (4!) - 100 * y)
    Simplifying, we get
    Total flowers at the start = (13 + y) * 100
    
    Since this is a whole number, there is no discount on flowers, so the final price of flowers is the same as the starting price:
    100$ per 100 flowers.
    
    Therefore, the earnings from flowers were:
    Earnings from flowers = (x-1) * (4!) * $4 + 100 * y dollars

5. Find the total earnings.
    Total earnings = Total earnings from selling roses + Earnings from flowers

6. Our final answer will look like this: `The final answer is {Total earnings} dollars`.

Let's plug these formulas into a step-by-step computation:

1. Find the original price of each rose before the discount.
    Original price of each rose = $4

2. Find the number of roses that April sold during the sale.
    Number of roses sold = 13 - (x-1)(x)(x-2)(x-3)

3. Find the total earnings from selling the roses.
    Total earnings from selling roses = $4 * [13 - (x-1)(x)(x-2)(x-3)] dollars

4. Add April's earnings from flowers that were not sold.
    A note on simplification: The expression (x-1) * (4!) can be further simplified as (12)(x)(x-2)(x-3). But, since (x-1) is a part of the calculation, we leave it as it is.
    Total flowers at the start = (13 + y) * 100
    Earnings from flowers = (x-1) * (4!) * $4 + 100 * y dollars

5. Find the total earnings.
    Total earnings = $4 * [13 - (x-1)(x)(x-2)(x-3)] + [(13 + y) * ",36,36.0,13.0

Step 1: Identify the given information
- Ned had 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts before school.
- If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash?

Step 2: Create a system to represent the given information
- Short sleeve shirts: S
- Long sleeve shirts: L
- Watched shirts: W
- Not watched shirts: NW

- Initial shirts: S9 L21
- Watched shirts: S2 S7 L1 W9
- Not watched shirts: S7 L21

- After washing, the new system would be:
- Short sleeve shirts: S
- Long sleeve shirts: L
- Watched shirts: W
- Not watched shirts: NW

- Initial shirts - Watched shirts = Not watched shirts

Step 3: Form an equation using the new system
- Initial shirts - Watched shirts = Not watched shirts
- S9L21 - S2S7L1W9 = S7L21

- Simplify the equation by grouping similar shirts
- S(9-2-1) + L(21-1) = S7L21

Step 4: Solve for the number of not watched shirts
Let S' and L' represent the short sleeve and long sleeve shirts, respectively, that were not watched.

- S' + L' = S7
- S' = S7 - L'

- Simplify the equation by substituting L' = S7 - S'
- S' + S7 - S' = S7 - S'

- Simplify the equation by grouping the same variable
- S' = S7 - S'

- Solve for S'
- S' = S7 - S'

- Add S' to both sides of the equation
- 2S' = S7

- Divide both sides by 2
- S' = {(S7)/2} short sleeve shirts were not washed.

- Substitute S' into the equation S' + L' = S7
- {(S7)/2} + (S7 - {(S7)/2}) = S7

- Solve for L'
- L' = {(S7)/2} long sleeve shirts were not washed.

The final answers are:
- Number of short sleeve shirts that were not washed: {(S7)/2}
- Number of long sleeve shirts that were not washed: {(S7)/2}

{The final answer is:}
- The number of short sleeve shirts that were not washed is {(S7)/2}, and the number of long sleeve shirts that were not washed is also {(S7)/2}.</s>",1,1.0,2.0

To solve this problem, we can use a variable, say x, to represent the number of books Tom had initially. This variable will help us keep track of the number of books Tom has at each stage of the problem.

1. Tom had x books in the beginning. {The initial number of books Tom had is x.}
2. Tom sold 4 books from his collection.
3. Let the number of books Tom sold be y. Hence, we can say that y = 4.
4. Tom earned some money by selling those 4 books. This money helped him buy 38 new books.
5. Let the amount that Tom earned by selling those 4 books be p.
6. The cost of each new book that Tom bought was the same. Let that cost be q.
7. Tom used the money earned by selling 4 books to buy 38 new books. Therefore, p/q = 38.
8. The total number of books that Tom has after selling 4 old books and buying 38 new ones will be the sum of the number of books initially (x), the number of books he sold (y = 4), and the number of new books he bought (38).

To solve this problem, let's define three variables: n represents the number of regular sodas Jerry bought, m represents the number of diet sodas Jerry bought, and k represents the number of shelves Jerry filled.

We also know that Jerry bought a total of 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas, so we can set up the following equations:

22 = m

We also know that Jerry's fridge can hold a maximum of 9 sodas per shelf. To find out how many shelves Jerry filled, we need to calculate the total number of sodas Jerry bought, and divide it by the number of sodas a shelf can hold. Then, we can compare it with the maximum number of shelves Jerry's fridge can hold:

Total number of sodas:  
Regular:  41 n
Diet:  22 m

Total number of sodas Jerry filled his fridge with is the sum of sodas from regular and diet bottles:

Total number of sodas Jerry put in his fridge:  
Regular:  41 n
Diet:  22 m

Total number of sodas:  
Total number of sodas from regular and diet bottles:  63 n + 22 m

Maximum number of sodas Jerry's fridge can hold per shelf:  
9

Now, let's figure out how many shelves Jerry filled:

Number of shelves Jerry filled:  
Number of sodas Jerry's fridge can hold per shelf:  9
Total number of sodas Jerry put in his fridge:  63 n + 22 m

Number of shelves Jerry filled:  
(Total number of sodas Jerry put in his fridge divided by the maximum number of sodas Jerry's fridge can hold per shelf)
(63 n + 22 m) / 9

We can plug the values of n and m into the equation above, but we still don't know their exact values. Let's work on that.

We are given the relationship between regular sodas, diet sodas, and total sodas Jerry bought.

Number of regular sodas:  
Number of total sodas:  41
Ratio:  41 : 9

Number of regular sodas:  x
Number of total sodas:  9x

Number of diet sodas:  
Number of total sodas:  22
Ratio:  22 : 11

Number of diet sodas:  y
Number of total sodas:  11y

Now, let's plug these values into our equation for the total number of sodas Jerry bought, and simplify:

Number of total sodas:  
Regular:  41
Diet:  22
Total number of sodas:  63 x + 11 y

Combining previous relationships:

Number of total sodas:  
Number of total sodas from regular bottles:  41
Number of total sodas from diet bottles:  22
Total number of sodas:  (63 x + 11 y)

Let's add this new equation to our older one:

Number of total sodas:  63 n + 22 m
Number of total sodas:  (63 x + 11 y)

We can see now that our two equations have the same variable (total number of sodas) so they are equivalent, which means their values would have to be the same.

Equating both equations and simplifying:

63 n + 22 m:  
(63 x + 11 y)

Using distributive property to eliminate common terms:

63(n - x) + 22(m - y):  
0

This is called a system of linear equations, where we have two equations with two variables (n and m). These two equations represent the equation of a system in two variables. Solving this system will help us determine the values of n and m in terms of the other two.

To solve this system, we can graph both equations on a coordinate plane. We choose any two values for n and m, and we get one point (x, y) on the plane. We create another set of values, then another, and so on. We can plot all of these points and draw a line over them. These lines represent the graph of the system.

                    question:
                     . For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had 32 ? pieces of candy : while her ; sister had 42. , If they ate 35 pieces the , first ? night, how many pieces do they : have left? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Find the number of pieces Debby had before they ate any candy. Let x be the number of pieces Debby had. Since Debby had 32 fewer pieces than her sister, and Debby's sister had 42 pieces, we can set up an equation to find x:

   Debby's sister (42) - Debby (x) = 32

   Simplifying,

   -42 + x = 32

   -Adding 32 to both sides,

   x = 104

   So, before they ate any candy, Debby had 104 pieces of candy.

2. Now, we know that they ate 35 pieces on the first night. Debby had x number of pieces at the end of the first night. Her sister also had fewer pieces than Debby, so let's call her sister's number of pieces y. Let's create an equation for this:

   Debby (x) - Debby (day 1) = Debby (day 2) (the number of pieces Debby had after eating on the first night)

   Debby's sister (y) - Debby's sister (day 1) = Debby's sister (day 2)

   Debby (day 1) = x (the number of pieces Debby had before eating on the first night)

   Simplifying,

   x - (x - 35) = Debby's sister (day 2) + (Debby's sister (day 1) - 35)

   Let's call the number of pieces Debby's sister had after eating on the first night v. Using this, we can simplify the equation above:

   x - x + 35 = v - 35

   -Adding x to both sides,

   x = v - 35

3. We now have two equations that will help us find x (the number of pieces Debby had before eating on night 1) and y (the number of pieces Debby's sister had before eating on night 1). Let's subtract the equation for x from the equation for y:

   y - x = Debby's sister (day 2) - Debby's sister (day 1)

   y - Debby's sister (day 2) + Debby's sister (day 2) - x = Debby's sister (day 1) - Debby's sister (day 1)

   y = Debby's sister (day 1) - Debby's sister (day 1) + Debby's sister (day 2) - x

   -Simplifying,

   y = Debby's sister (day 1) - x

   Plugging in x for the number of pieces Debby had before eating on night 1, and v for the number of pieces Debby's sister had after eating on night 1 (which we got from the equation in step two), we get:

   y = 42 - 104 + v - 35

   -Simplifying,

   y = 7 (Debby's sister's starting number) - (Debby's starting number) + v - 35

4. This equation will help us find y (the number of pieces Debby's sister had before eating on night 1). Plugging in the numbers we know, we get:

   v = y - 35 (equations for Debby from step 2)

   Substituting into the equation above:

   y = 7 - (104 - v) - 35

5. Simplifying:

   y = -27 + v

   Since this is an equation for y, we should find a way in which we can set y to be a specific number. Let's set y to the number of pieces Debby's sister has remaining:

   y = remaining candy

   Substituting into the equation above:

   -27 + v = remaining candy

6. To find the remaining number of pieces, v, let's substitute Debby's sister's remaining candy for y:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we'll use a step-by-step approach and clearly label each step of our reasoning.

1. Emily was planting vegetables in both a big garden and some small gardens. We don't know how many small gardens she has, so let's call that number x.
2. We know that Emily started with 41 seeds in total. Some of these seeds went into the big garden, and the remainder went into the small gardens. Let's call the number of seeds she planted in the big garden p, and the number she planted in each of the x small gardens s.
3. We also know that Emily planted 29 seeds in the big garden. To find p, we can set up an equation with the number of seeds planted in the big garden (p) and the remaining seeds (c) we know to be true.
   - Emily started with 41 seeds.
   - She planted 29 seeds in the big garden (p).
   - She has some remaining seeds (c).
   - Add all the seeds together.
   41 = 29 + c
   41 - 29 = 29 - 29 (subtracting the number of seeds Emily planted in the big garden from both sides)
   12 = c
   So, Emily has 12 seeds remaining from the original 41.
4. Now let's find out how many seeds Emily planted in each small garden (s). We know that in total, Emily planted 4 seeds in each small garden, but we also know that she planted a total of 29 seeds in all the small gardens combined (from part 2). We'll represent the total number of small gardens as x.
   - Emily planted s seeds in each small garden.
   - She planted 4 seeds in each of the x small gardens.
   - The total number of seeds she planted in all the small gardens (t) is s times the number of small gardens (x). 
   4s = 29 (we know that she planted a total of 29 seeds in all the small gardens)
5. Let's find out how many small gardens Emily has (x). We know that she planted s seeds in each small garden (step 4), and she planted a total of 41 seeds (step 1). We can find x by finding out how many small gardens are needed to plant all the remaining seeds (12) and the seeds she planted in each small garden (s).
   - Emily has some small gardens (x), each with s seeds.
   - We know that she planted a total of 12 seeds in the remaining seeds (c).
   - We also know that we can find the number of small gardens needed to plant the remaining seeds (d) by dividing the number of remaining seeds (c) by the number of seeds planted in each small garden (s).
   - So, we'll represent the number of small gardens she has as x and the number of remaining seeds as c, and find x based on the number of remaining seeds (c) and the number of seeds planted in each small garden (s).
   12 = x * s
   We don't know the value of s yet, but we know it's the same for each small garden. So, we can set up another equation with the value of s.
   4s = 29 (from step 4)
   4 * x * s = 29
   We can find s by dividing 29 by 4x.
   1 / 4 = x (from the other equation with s)
   4x = 1 / x
   29 = 1 / x * x * s
   29 = 29 x (multiplying both sides by x)
   1 = x (simplifying both sides)
   
   We found that Emily has exactly one small garden (x = 1). 

The final answer is: Emily has exactly one small garden.

For the other variables, we can use the equations we just found:

- The number of seeds Emily planted in the big garden (p) is 29.
- The number of seeds she planted in each small garden (s) is 4.
- Emily planted a total of 41 seeds, with 29 in the big garden and 12 remaining for the small gardens (the sum of the values of p and c).

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent Emily's candy collection as an algebraic expression. Let 'x' be the number of pieces of candy Emily received from her older sister, and 'y' be the number of pieces she received from her neighbors.

The total number of pieces Emily received is the sum of pieces received from her neighbor and sister.

Total pieces received = y + x

Let's find the expression for the number of pieces Emily ate per day. This is represented by 'p'.

Number of pieces Emily ate per day = p

We know that Emily ate a total of '9' pieces on 'a' days. So,

Number of pieces Emily ate in 'a' days = 9p

Let's find the expression for the number of pieces Emily has left, after eating 'p' number of pieces each day, for 'a' number of days.

Let's let 'z' be the final number of pieces Emily has.

Final number of pieces Emily has = z

Initially, Emily has the number of pieces represented by the expression '(y + x)' - '(9p)' because she ate '9p' number of pieces.

After 'a' number of days, as Emily ate 'p' number of pieces every day, the total number of pieces consumed would be 'pa'.

So the expression for the number of pieces Emily has is:

'z' = 'y + x' - '(9p)' + 'pa'

Now, we are asked to find out how long the candy would last Emily, if she ate 'p' number of pieces every day.

So, 'z' should represent the number of pieces Emily has on the very last day.

Using the same expression found above, we can get the value of 'z' by setting the other variables as known values.

Let's find 'y', 'x', 'a', 'p' values.
'x' = '13' (given)
'y' = '5' (given)
'a' = 'The length of time it will last her' (which needs to be determined)
'p' = '9' (given)

Let's find the expression by substituting these values into 'z'

'z' = 'y + x' - '(9p)' + 'pa'

'z' = '5' + '13' - '(9 * 9)' + '116'

'z' = '153' - '81'

'z' = '72'

Now, we've found the value of 'z' and as it is a final number that Emily has, hence, it's the number of pieces that she would have, on the very last day.

So, 'a' would be the value of 'z' divided by 'p'.

Length of time it would last her = 'a'
            = '72' / '9'
            = '8' years (since '1 candy piece' is negligibly smaller than '1 day')

So, as per our calculations, if Emily ate '9' pieces every day, her candy would last for '8' years.

First, we need to determine how many books are left for Mike to put away after the librarian takes some. Let's call the number of books the librarian takes x. Then, the number of books left for Mike is 82 - x.

Next, we need to find out how many books the librarian takes in a batch. This is represented by the expression 10*. We don't know the exact value of * yet, but we do know it's a decimal because some partial books may be left over.

The remaining librarian then leaves, so the number of books left for Mike becomes 82 - x - *. This is represented by the expression (82 - x) - *.

Now, we need to find out how many books Mike can put on each shelf. Let's call this value y. We know that Mike can fit 9*y books on a single shelf, so the total number of books on a single shelf is 9*y.

Using this information, we can determine how many shelves Mike will need. This is equivalent to how many shelves can fit the remaining books. This is represented by the expression (82 - x - *) / (9*y).

Putting it all together, the final answer is (82 - x - *) / (9*y). This is our expression to determine how many shelves Mike will need to put away the remaining books.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pictures Nancy took on her vacation:

   Number of pictures at the zoo = 49
   Number of pictures at the museum = 8
   Total number of pictures taken (zoo + museum) = 49 + 8 = 57

2. Subtract the deleted pictures from the total number of pictures to find how many pictures Nancy still has:

   Total number of pictures taken (Step 1) = 57
   Number of pictures deleted = 38
   Number of pictures still having (Totals - Deletions) = 57 - 38 = 19

3. Combine the remaining pictures from the zoo and the museum:

   Number of pictures still having from the zoo = 49
   Number of pictures still having from the museum = 8
   Total number of pictures still having (zoo + museum) = 49 + 8 = 57

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to identify the unknown variables and set up equations using the given information. Let's call the number of windows needed as x, the number of windows already installed as y, and the time it takes to install each window as t.

We know that in total, there are 14 windows. So, we can set up an equation for the total number of windows as follows:

x + y = 14

Next, we know that the builder has already installed 8 windows. Let's call this the number of installed windows as y. So, we can set up an equation for the already installed windows as follows:

y = 8

Using the given information, we know that it takes 8 hours to install each window. Let's call this the time it takes to install each window as t.

To find out how long it takes to install the remaining windows, we first find out how many windows are left to be installed, which is (x - y). Then, we multiply (x - y) by the time it takes to install each window (t). Here's how we can set up the equation:

(x - y) * t = total time taken to install the remaining windows

Now, we have three equations and three unknown variables (x, y, and t). But, we can use the second equation to replace y with 8 in the first equation, which gives us:

x - 8 = 14 - 8 (substitution made)

x - 8 = 6

We solve for x:

x = 6 + 8

x = 14

At this point, we know the total number of windows (x) is 14, as we've already assumed. Let's use the value of x in the second equation to find y:

y = 8

Finally, to find the time it takes to install the remaining windows, we use the equation we set up earlier:

(x - y) * t = total time taken to install the remaining windows

But, we already know that x is 14 and y is 8. So, here's how we can set up the final equation:

(14 - 8) * t = total time taken to install the remaining windows

(6) * t = total time taken to install the remaining windows

t = total time taken to install the remaining windows / 6

Let's call the total time taken to install the remaining windows as T. Then, we can simplify the equation as below:

t = T / 6

At this point, we have successfully found the unknown variables. Now, let's find out the final answer!

<|assistant|>
To solve this word problem, we can approach it using a system of linear equations with variables representing the number of oranges. Let x be the number of old oranges in the bin before throwing some away, and y be the number of new oranges put in the bin.

We know that the total number of oranges (old and new) in the bin after putting the new oranges in is 40. This can be written as an equation:

x + y = 40  (Equation 1)

Next, we have the number of old oranges that were thrown away, which was 25. Since there were x old oranges originally, and we're throwing away a certain number, we can create another equation:

x - 25 = y  (Equation 2)

Let's analyze these equations.

Equation 1 tells us that the total number of oranges in the bin is the sum of the old and new oranges. Since x is the number of old oranges, and y is the number of new oranges, we can find the number of oranges in the bin after putting the new ones in.

Equation 2 helps us find the relationship between the number of old oranges that were thrown away and the number of new oranges that were put in. Since we're trying to find x, we'll use this equation to solve for x in terms of y.

To do that, we'll solve Equation 2 for x:

x = y + 25 (Equation 3)

Now that we have a relationship between x and y, we can substitute that into Equation 1 to get a new equation that uses our variable y and does not have x:

y + y = 40 (Equation 4)

To solve for y, we can isolate y on one side of the equation:

2y = 40

y = 20 (The final answer is 20)

So, now that we know the number of new oranges that were put in, we can find the total number of oranges in the bin using Equation 1. Substituting our value for y of 20, we get:

x + 20 = 40

To find x, we can isolate it:

x = 40 - 20

x = 20 (The final answer is 20)

So, it looks like our initial system of equations led us to the answer that the store actually had 20 old oranges left after throwing away 25, plus the 21 new oranges that were then put in the bin, for a total of 40 oranges in the bin.

Thus, the number of oranges in the bin is 40, and the final answer for the number of old oranges left is 20, with a total of 20 old oranges and 21 new oranges, for a grand total of 41. The final answer is 41.</s>",36,36.0,41.0

<|assistant|>
Step 1: Identify the given information

- The waiter had 7 customers
- Of those customers, 5 did not leave a tip
- Each customer who left a tip paid $3

Step 2: Find the number of customers who left a tip

To find the number of customers who left a tip, we can solve a system of equations. Let x be the number of customers who left a tip. Then, 2 of the 7 customers did not leave a tip, so there were 5 customers who did not leave a tip. This means 7 - 2 = 5 customers did not leave a tip, and 7 - 5 = 2 customers left a tip.

So, with some simple algebra, we get:

x = 2

x = number of customers who left a tip
2 = number of customers who did not leave a tip (these are the same 2 numbers, but we're using different variable names)
5 = total number of customers - number of customers who left a tip (constrained by the initial statement ""7 customers"")

We can then set this up as a system of equations:

x + 2 = 5
x = 2

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

2 + 2 = 5
4 = 5

This is a contradiction, since we cannot have 4 customers who left a tip and 1 customer who did not leave a tip. This means that it's not possible for there to be 7 customers at all; we either need more information to solve the system (such as how much tip the customers left, as a percentage or dollar amount), or we need to reconsider the given statement about the number of customers.

As there seems to be an error in the original statement, we'll assume that the original statement was ""The waiter had 7 customers,"" rather than ""The waiter had 7 customers and ? 5 : of them didn't leave a tip."" This allows us to continue with the problem.

Step 3: Find the money earned from the customers who left a tip

Let's call the total amount that the customers who left a tip paid $y. Each customer who left a tip paid $3, so:

y = 2 * $3/customer

y = $6

Step 4: Find the money earned from the customers who did not leave a tip

Let's call the total amount that the customers who did not leave a tip paid $z$. Since they did not leave a tip, they each paid $3 (the price of the meal). Since there were 5 of them, the total amount they paid is:

z = 5 * $3/customer

z = $15

Step 5: Add up the total amount earned by the waiter

We can now add up the total amount earned by the waiter. The customers who left a tip paid $y, and the customers who did not leave a tip paid $z. So, the total amount earned by the waiter is:

total amount earned = $y + $z + ($3/customer) * 2 (the amount earned from the 2 customers who left a tip, over and above the tip they left)

Plugging in our values for y, z, and the number of customers who left a tip (which we previously found to be 2), we get:

total amount earned = $6 + $15 + $6

total amount earned = $27

The waiter earned a total of $27.

<|assistant|>
To find out how many pieces of candy Faye has now, we can use the formula for finding the total number of candy pieces she has, given the number of pieces she consumed on the first night and the additional number of pieces she received from her sister on the second night.

Let's call the number of candy pieces Faye consumed on the first night as ""x"" and the additional number of pieces given by her sister as ""y"".

Then, Faye's total number of candy pieces, ""z"", is given by:

z = x + y

Using the given information in the problem, we can find the individual values of ""x"" and ""y"" and insert them in the formula for ""z"".

x = 25  // Faye consumed 25 pieces on the first night
y = 40  // Faye's sister gave her 40 more pieces

z = 47  // The total number of candy pieces Faye has is 47

Substituting the values of ""x"" and ""y"" in the formula for ""z"", we get:

47 = 25 + 40

Upon solving for the variables, we get:

z = 65

Therefore, Faye has a total of 65 pieces of candy right now, that is, {The final answer is 65}.</s>",62,62.0,65.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. First, let's determine how many friends there are in the group. We can do this by solving the ratio 4 : friends. Let's call the number of friends x. Now, we set up a ratio where we know the value of four, and we want to find the value of x:

4 : friends = 4 : x

Next, we need to get rid of the colons and find a way to make the equation easier to solve. We can do this by multiplying both sides by the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and x, which is just x. Doing so gives us:

4 * x = 4 * 4

Now, we have a system of two equations (one with four friends and one with x friends) that we can solve simultaneously:

4 = 4 * 4 / x

x = 16 / 4

x = 4

2. Next, we know that the chef already had 9 chicken wings when the group arrived. We want to know how many wings were cooked for the group, so we can find that by subtracting the number of wings the chef had when the group arrived (9) from the total number of wings that were cooked (7 more than the chef had).

total wings = 9 + 7

total wings = 16

3. Now, we want to find out how many wings each person got. There are four friends in the group, and they all got the same amount. We'll call the number of wings each person got w.

each person got w wings

4 friends each got w wings

4 * w = total wings

substituting the number of total wings we found in step 2, we get:

4 * w = 16

w = 4

Each person got 4 wings.

4. Putting it all together, we can say that the group consisted of 4 friends, who went into a restaurant where there was already a chef, and they each ate 4 chicken wings. Altogether, they enjoyed a total of 16 chicken wings. The final answer is:

The group of 4 friends each ate 4 chicken wings for a total of 16 wings enjoyed by the group.</s>",4,4.0,16.0

Step 1: Identify the variables and expressions in the prompt.
- John earned $8! (8 dollars with an exclamation mark) per lawn he mowed.
- John had 15 lawns to mow.
- John forgot to mow 7 of those lawns.
- The number of lawns John actually mowed is represented by x.
- The amount of money John earned is represented by y.

Step 2: Write an expression for the amount of money John earned mowing x lawns.
- John earned $8! per lawn, so if x is the number of lawns he mowed, the amount of money he earned for those x lawns is $8! times x, or $8! x.

Step 3: Subtract the amount of money John would have earned from those 7 forgotten lawns.
- The amount of money John would have earned from the 7 forgotten lawns is $8! times 7, or $8! times 7.

Step 4: Combine the two expressions we found and solve for y, the total amount of money John earned.
- The expression for the total money John earned is y = $8! x - $8! times 7, or y = (8! x - 8!7).

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
First, let's find out how many puppies the shelter has in total. We're given that they had x puppies when y more puppies were brought in. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + 35 = total number of puppies

We need to find x. Let's call the original number of puppies x, and the number of puppies brought in y.

x = total number of puppies - 35

x = total number of puppies - y

Let z be the number of puppies remaining at any given point. We can set up another equation to represent this:

z = total number of puppies - number of puppies adopted

We want to find the value of z when all the puppies are adopted. Let's call that value z2. It's equivalent to finding the total number of puppies adopted, which we'll call x2. The third equation will represent the number of puppies adopted in a day.

x2 = number of days it takes to adopt all the puppies x

8 = number of puppies adopted per day

We can represent this with an equation:

x2 = (number of days it takes to adopt all the puppies) x 8

Now let's see how these equations connect. When all the puppies are adopted, we can substitute the total number of puppies with the number of puppies remaining (z2) in the equations we created earlier:

z2 = total number of puppies - y - number of puppies adopted

z2 = z - x2

Let's substitute x for z and x2 for the number of puppies adopted in the second equation:

z2 = total number of puppies - number of puppies adopted - (number of days it takes to adopt all the puppies) x 8

We can simplify by factoring out the number of days:

z2 = (total number of puppies - y - number of days it takes to adopt all the puppies) - (number of days it takes to adopt all the puppies) x 8

We can simplify some more to make the expression more manageable:

z2 = (-y + total number of puppies) + (number of days it takes to adopt all the puppies) (total number of puppies - y) x 8

Let's substitute -y + total number of puppies in the first equation, setting it equal to x:

x = (-y + total number of puppies)

Now let's substitute this in the equation we created for the days it takes to adopt all the puppies using the number of puppies adopted per day and the number of puppies remaining:

x2 = (total number of puppies - y) / 8

We need to find y, the number of puppies brought in. We'll substitute x2 into the expression (-y + total number of puppies) using the equation we created for the number of puppies remaining:

z2 = (-y + total number of puppies + (total number of puppies - y) / 8) - (total number of puppies - y) / 8 x 8

We can simplify this expression by realizing that the terms (-y + total number of puppies) and (-y + total number of puppies) / 8 are subtracted, which cancels out the y term:

z2 = (total number of puppies) / 8

So when all the puppies are adopted, there will be no more puppies to adopt, and thus there's 0 puppies remaining (z2 = 0). We can substitute this into our expression for the number of days it takes to adopt all the puppies and simplify:

x2 = (total number of puppies - y) / 8

0 = (total number of puppies - y - (total number of puppies - y) x 8) / 8

Simplifying we can see that y has to be zero, meaning that no more puppies were brought in, and the total number of puppies is equivalent to the original number of puppies when the shelter started:

x2 = (total number of puppies - 0) / 8

x2 = total number of puppies / 8

The final answer is: 

The number of days it takes to adopt all the puppies at a rate of 8 puppies a day is the quotient",5,5.0,8.0

<|assistant|>
Let's break this problem down into individual steps:

1. The new building needs a total of 9 windows. We'll call this the total number of windows needed, which we can represent with the variable W.
    - W = 9 {The total number of windows needed is 9.}

2. The builder has already installed 6 windows. We'll call this the number of windows already installed, which we can represent with the variable A.
    - A = 6 {The builder has already installed 6 windows.}

3. The builder takes 6 hours to install each window. We'll call this the number of hours it takes to install one window, which we can represent with the variable H.
    - H = 6 {It takes 6 hours to install one window.}

4. The builder is currently working to install the remaining windows, which we'll represent with the variable R.
    - R = W - A {The number of windows that still need to be installed is the total number of windows needed, minus the number of windows already installed.}

5. The number of hours it takes the builder to install the remaining windows is represented by the variable T. We can find T by multiplying the number of remaining windows by the number of hours it takes to install one window, and then adding the time it took to install the first 6 windows.
    - T = H * R + 6 {[R] windows take [H] hours to install, and the [A] windows already installed took 6 hours, so the total time to install all [A + R] windows is the sum of these two parts.}

6. Now we can put it all together using algebra to solve for T:
    - T = H * (W - A) + 6
    - Simplify: T = 6 (W - 3)
    - {The final answer is:} T = 36 (W - 3)

In English: The time it takes the builder to install the remaining windows, plus the time it took to install the first 6 windows, equals the total time it will take to install all the windows in the building.

To solve this problem, we can use the adding formula for consecutive amounts. Let's call the number of worksheets graded after grading 7 but before grading the additional 36 as x.

Number of worksheets graded after grading 7: 7
Number of worksheets graded after grading x but before grading the additional 36: x
Number of worksheets graded after grading all worksheets: 34
Number of worksheets graded after grading the additional 36: 34 + 36

Let's set up an equation using these information:

x + 7 = 34 (number of worksheets graded after grading 7)

Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation to get:

x = 27 (number of worksheets graded before grading the additional 36)

Now, we can apply the adding formula again. Let N be the number of worksheets she has to grade in total.

Number of worksheets graded after grading x: x = 27
Number of worksheets graded after grading x and before grading another 36: 27 + 36 = 63
Number of worksheets graded after grading all worksheets: N

Let's set up an equation using these information:

63 = N - 36 (number of worksheets graded after grading the additional 36)

Substituting the value of x to equation 2:

63 = 34 - 36 + x

Simplifying and rearranging:

   - From playing the arcade games: 33 tickets in total.
   - So the total number of tickets Frank won is 27 + 33, which equals 60 tickets in total.

2. Divide the total number of tickets by the number of tickets required to buy one candy:
   - Each candy costs 6 tickets, so we divide the total number of tickets by 6 to find out how many candies that number of tickets can buy.

2. Rachel found 5 treasures on the first level.

3. Rachel found ? treasures on the second level. (Unkown)

4. Rachel found ? treasures on the third level. (Unkown)

5. We want to find Rachel's total score.

6. To find Rachel's score on the first level, we multiply the number of treasures found (5) by the number of points earned per treasure (9):

    First-level score = 5 * 9 = 45

7. To find Rachel's score on the second level, we again multiply the number of treasures found (?) by the number of points earned per treasure (9):

    Second-level score = ? * 9

8. To find Rachel's score on the third level, we do the same. (The level number isn't explicitly stated, so we'll assume it's the third level, and Rachel found ? treasures there.) Note that in step 7, there's an ? in the middle - once we know the value of ?, we can easily calculate ? here as well.

12. Rachel found 2 treasures on the second level, and since we already know that this comes to ? points (step 7), we have a simple equation for ?, the number of treasures she found on the second level.

13. Find the value of ? in terms of our known variables:

    ? = Second-level treasures found
    
    Second-level score = ? * 9
    
    ? = Second-level treasures found / (9 points per treasure)

16. Substitute the known values of Rachel's scores on the first and second levels, as found in steps 5 and 7.

    Total number of treasures found = 45 + (Second-level treasures found / (9 points per treasure)) + ?

17. Factor out ? and set up a system of equations.

    Total number of treasures found = ?(1 + Second-level treasures found / (9 * ?)) + 45 + Second-level treasures found / (9 * ?)

To solve this problem, we need to consider a few things. First, we don't know how many customers left tips and how many didn't. Second, we know the initial number of customers and the number of additional customers during the lunch rush. Lastly, we know the percentage of customers who didn't leave tips.

Let's define an unknown variable:

Now, we can set up two equations. The first equation represents the total number of customers during the morning:

- 0 = the number of customers who didn't leave a tip during the morning
- 26 - 0 = the number of customers who left a tip, which we don't know yet

- 27 = the new number of customers
- 27 - 21 = the number of customers who didn't leave a tip during the lunch rush
- x = the unknown variable from our first equation

Let's put these two equations together to find our x variable:

1st Equation:
- 26 = x

2nd Equation:
- 27 = x + 21

Let's isolate x in Equation 1 to eliminate duplication:
- 26 = x

Now let's substitute x from Equation 1 in Equation 2:
- 27 = 26 + 21
- Simplify: 27 = 47

Now let's see if we can solve for x using this newly obtained formula:

Let's take -26 from both sides:
- 27 - 26 = 47 - 26
- Simplify: 1 = 21

This is impossible since there is no way that 1 can be equal to 21. Hence our first assumption didn't make sense, so we need to rephrase our initial equations.

Let's modify our initial equations:

1st Equation:
- Total number of customers during the morning = 26

2nd Equation:
- Number of customers who didn't leave a tip during the lunch rush = 0

We still don't know how many customers left a tip, but we know that it includes the customers who left a tip during the morning.

Let's calculate the third equation, which represents the total number of customers during the lunch rush:
- 27 = the new number of customers
- Total number of customers during the morning = 26
- Number of customers who didn't leave a tip during the morning = 0
- Our unknown variable x = the total number of customers who left a tip

Let's put these three equations together to find our x variable:

1st Equation:
- 26 = the initial number of customers

2nd Equation:
- 0 = the number of customers who didn't leave a tip during the morning

3rd Equation:
- 27 = initial number of customers + number of customers who left during the lunch rush + customers who left a tip
- 27 = 26 + x

Now let's isolate x in Equation 3:
- 26 + x = 27
- Simplify: x = 27 - 26

Let's calculate our unknown variable:
- x = 1

Let's check if our solution for x satisfies all the equations:
- 26 + 1 = 27 (which is right from our third equation)
- 0 = 0 (which is right from our second equation)

Now let's calculate the total amount of tips that are left by these customers in terms of money. Let's say that the average tip rate is around 15%, which is 0.15 times the total bill. Since our waiter charges his customers based on the bill, let's define a second unknown variable, y, which represents the total revenue from these customers:

Let's define our second equation in terms of y:
- Initial number of customers * Average bill per customer = Initial revenue
- Total number of customers who left a tip * Average tip per customer + Total number of customers who didn't leave a tip * Average bill per customer = Total revenue (y",26,26.0,0.15

<|assistant|>
To solve this word problem, we can use the steps of finding the total number of bears, finding the number of shelves required to accommodate all the bears, and then determining the remaining information, such as the number of bears on each shelf.

Step 1: Find the total number of bears

We can represent the number of bears in the first shipment as x and the number of bears in the second shipment as y. Let's substitute these values into the given conditions:

x = 17 (initially in stock)
y = 10 (from the second shipment)

Let's find the total number of bears:

Total bears = Number of bears from the first shipment + Number of bears from the second shipment

    Total bears = x + y

Step 2: Find the number of shelves required

Let's assume that each shelf can accommodate b bears. The number of shelves required can be determined by dividing the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf.

Number of shelves required = Total number of bears / Bears per shelf

Using the steps from the previous steps, we can find the total number of bears and the number of bears per shelf:

    Total bears = x + y
    Bears per shelf = 9 (given condition)

    Number of shelves required = (x + y) / 9

Step 3: Find the remaining information

Now that we know the total number of shelves required, let's find the number of bears on each shelf, assuming that each shelf has the same number of bears.

Number of bears on each shelf = Total number of bears / Number of shelves

    Number of bears on each shelf = (x + y) / (Number of shelves required)

Finally, using all the information we've gathered, let's solve the problem:

    Question: How many shelves did they use?
    The final answer is: (Number of shelves required) shelves

Putting it all together:

Step 1: Find the total number of bears

    x = 17
    y = 10

    Total bears = x + y

    Total bears = 17 + 10

    Total bears = 27

Step 2: Find the number of shelves required

    Total bears = 27
    Bears per shelf = 9

    Number of shelves required = Total bears / Bears per shelf

    Number of shelves required = 27 / 9

    Number of shelves required = 3

Step 3: Find the remaining information

    Number of bears on each shelf = Total bears / Number of shelves required

    Number of bears on each shelf = 27 / 3

    Number of bears on each shelf = 9

    Final Answer:

    Question: How many shelves did they use?

    The final answer is: 3 shelves

<|assistant|>
Here's how we can think through this problem step by step:

1. Let's first identify how many books Gwen has in total for the mystery and picture books. 

2. For the mystery books, Gwen has 5 shelves, and each shelf has exactly 4 books, so Gwen has a total of 4 * 5 = 20 mystery books.

3. For the picture books, Gwen has 3 shelves, and each shelf has exactly 4 books, so Gwen has a total of 4 * 3 = 12 picture books.

4. Adding the number of mystery and picture books we found in steps 2 and 3, we can see that Gwen has a total of 20 mystery books and 12 picture books, making a grand total of 32 books.

5. To write this out as an equation, we would set up two variables, one for the mystery books and one for the picture books, and solve for the total number of books:

    - Let x = the number of mystery books, so we have x = 20.
    - Let y = the number of picture books, so we have 3 shelves with 4 picture books per shelf, or y = 12.
    - Adding the number of mystery and picture books together, we have a total of Gwen's books:  
    x + y = total number of books.
    - Substituting our values of x and y into this equation gives us:
    - 20 + 12 = 32.

6. We know that we started with 5 shelves of mystery books and 3 shelves of picture books. Since our equation represents the total number of books Gwen has, we can use it to find how many shelves Gwen eventually has in total.
    - Let z = the total number of shelves.
    - We know from step 2 that each shelf (except for the 5th one for the mystery books) contains exactly 4 books. Let's write that out as an equation:
    - 4 * (z - 5) = total number of picture books.
    - When we substitute our values of z, x, and y, we can express this in terms of the mystery books and the total number of shelves:
    - 4 * (z - 5) = 12.
    - 4z - 20 = 12.
    - 4z = 32.
    - So we can see that z, the total number of shelves, is 8.

7. Combining our results, we know that Gwen has 32 books in total, with 5 shelves of mystery books and 3 shelves of picture books. She has a total of 8 shelves.

{The final answer is: Gwen has a total of 32 books, distributed between 5 shelves of mystery books and 3 shelves of picture books, all with exactly 4 books on each shelf. She has a total of 8 shelves in her bookcase.}</s>",32,32.0,8.0

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of pictures in the individual albums with the variables x and y, as we don't know which one contains the remaining pictures.

We know that a total of 79 pictures were uploaded, and 44 of them were put into one album. The remaining 35 pictures were distributed among 5 albums, one at a time.

Let's take the equation for the number of pictures in the first album x:

x + 44 = 79 (Total pictures uploaded)

x = 79 - 44 (Substitution)

x = 35

Now let's consider the remaining albums, for which we create a system of linear equations with the variables for the number of pictures in each remaining album (y).

y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 = 35 (Total remaining pictures)

We can also determine the number of pictures in the first album and sum it up with the pictures from the remaining albums, which should total the number of pictures uploaded.

X + y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 = 79

Now we can solve this system using either matrix, elimination or substitution methods. Let's perform substitution, using the value for x:

x = 35

Replacing x with 35 in our system:

35 + y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 = 79

y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 = 44

We can now solve this system using substitution. Let's choose y1 as our variable to solve for, leaving the rest of the variables as unknowns:

y1 = 44 - (y2 + y3 + y4 + y5)

Now we can substitute this expression for y1 into our previous equation with x and simplify our system:

35 - (y2 + y3 + y4 + y5) + y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 = 79

Simplifying our equation:

y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 = 79 - 70

y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 = 9

To solve this system, the simplest way seems to choose one variable at a time and replace its value in terms of the other variables. Let's say we solve for y2:

y2 = 9 - (y3 + y4 + y5)

We can substitute this expression for y2 into our system and solve for y3:

y3 = 9 - (y2 + y4 + y5)

Using the expression obtained for y3, we can now substitute it into the expression obtained for y2 to obtain y4:

y4 = 9 - (y2 + y3 + y5)

Finally, we can use our expressions obtained for y2, y3, and y4, replacing each variable in terms of y5:

y5 = 9 - (y4 + y2 + y3)

Now that we have values for all our variables, we can substitute them into the original equations to find out how many pictures were in each album:

x = 35

Album 1: Contains 35 pictures

y2 = 9 - (y4 + y2 + y3)

Album 2: Contains (9 - (x + y3 + y4)) pictures

y3 = 9 - (y2 + y4 + y5)

Album 3: Contains (9 - (x + y2 + y5)) pictures

y4 = 9 - (y2 + y3 + y5)

Album 4: Contains (9 - (x + y2 + y3)) pictures

Album 5: Contains 9 - (x + y2 + y3 + y4) pictures

The final answers are:

Album 1 contains 35 pictures
Album 2 contains 3 pictures
Album 3 contains 3 pictures
Album 4 contains 3 pictures

| Team   | Boys | Girls | Total   |
|------- |------- |------- |------- |
| Debate | 5     | 40    | 45     |

We want to find the number of groups of 9 that can be formed with both boys and girls from this team. First, we need to find how many groups of 9 we can form with just the girls.

One group of 9 girls can be formed with 9 girls, so we could form 40/9 = 4.44... Groups of 9 using only girls. However, we can't form a fraction of a group, so we need to round down. Therefore, we could form 4 groups of 9 girls.

Now, we have 5 boys remaining. If each group contains both boys and girls, we need to figure out how many girls are needed to form a group of 9 with one boy. If we call this number x, then each group would have 1 boy and x girls. So the total number of girls in each group would be (x-1) + x = 9. Rearranging this equation, we get x = 8.

Therefore, we could form 5 groups of 9 with both boys and girls, each with 1 boy and 8 girls.

In total, we could form 4 groups of 9 with only girls, and 5 groups of 9 with both boys and girls, for a total of 9 groups of 9.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can set up an equation using the given information. Let's call the price of each rose after the discount x. Before the discount, the price of each rose was $x + 0.70.

April started with 9 roses, so her initial investment was $9(x+0.70) = px. After the sale, she had 4 roses left, so her total earnings from the roses was $4(x) = er.

We know that her total earnings from the sale were $7.20 (since she had 4 roses left and each rose was $1.80 after the discount). We also know that her earnings from the rose sales were $er$.

Substituting in the given values and equations, we get:

$7.20 = 4(x) + (9-4)(x+0.70)$

Simplifying, we get:

$7.20 = 4x + x$

$x = $7.20

So, each rose costs $7.20 after the discount. We can then calculate the total amount April earned from selling her roses using the relationship between e and r in the equation er = 4x.

$er = 4(7.20) = $28.80$

Adding this to the initial investment of $9(x+0.70)$ leaves us with the overall amount April earned from the sales:

$9(x+0.70) + er = px + er$

Substituting, we get:

$9(x+0.70) + 4(7.20) = $(p+7.20)x$

Simplifying, we get:

$12.40 = (p+7.20)x$

Dividing both sides by $(p+7.20)$, we get:

$x = $1.54\text{ dollars}$

So, the price of each rose before the discount was $1.54\text{ dollars}$. We can then calculate the total amount April earned from selling her roses using the initial investment of $9(1.54\text{ dollars})$ and the earnings from the roses of $4(1.54\text{ dollars})$:

$9(1.54)+4(1.54) = $7.52\text{ dollars}$

Finally, adding this to the earnings from the sale of the remaining roses leaves us with the overall amount April earned from the sales:

$7.52 + 4(7.20) = $(p+7.20)x + 7.20$

Simplifying, we get:

$12.40 = (p+7.20)x + 7.20$

Subtracting 7.20 from both sides, we get:

$5.20 = (p+7.20)x$

Dividing both sides by $(p+7.20)$, we get:

$x = $0.71\text{ dollars}$

So, the initial investment for the $9$ roses was $9(1.54+0.70\text{ dollars}) = $12.10\text{ dollars}$.

Finally, we can calculate the total amount April earned from the sales and initial investment:

$e + p =$28.80 + $12.10 = $40.90\text{ dollars}$

Putting everything together, April's earnings from the sale were $32.70\text{ dollars}$ ($7.20\text{ dollars}$ from the remaining roses and $25.50\text{ dollars}$ from the sale) and her total costs were $40.90\text{ dollars}$. Thus, she incurred a $8.20\text{ dollar}$ loss.

In summary, April's ; discount flowers ; was having . a sale , where each : rose was 7 dollars. If ? April ; started with 9 roses and had 4 roses left, her initial investment was $12.10\text{ dollars}$ and she incurred a loss of $8.20\text{ dollars}$. The",35,35.0,8.2

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first note that the number of team members who did show up is 11 - 6, or 5. Then, we calculate the total points scored by the team members who did show up. Each of the 5 members who did show up scored 9 points, so the total number of points scored by these members is 45 (5 members times 9 points per member).

Now, let's calculate the total number of points scored by the team overall. We know that 5 members scored a total of 45 points, and 6 members did not show up. We'll assume that these 6 missing members would have scored a total of x points, had they shown up. (Note that the actual value of x is unknown at this point - we'll just call it a placeholder until we can determine its value.)

Putting everything together, we can write the relationship between the number of points scored by the team members who did show up and the missing members:

points by showing members = 45

points by missing members = x

total points scored = 45 + x

We want to find the total points scored by the team, so we simply plug these values into the equation:

total points scored = 45 + x

To find the value of x, we need to use additional information. In this case, the problem states that there were 11 total team members, and 6 of them did not show up. So, we calculate the number of points scored by the missing team members as:

points by missing members = total points scored by missing members - (number of missing members times 0 points)

points by missing members = x - (6 times 0 points)

points by missing members = x

But we already knew that! In other words, the number of points scored by the missing team members is the same as the value of x we've been using all along. We can replace this value for x in our total points scored equation:

total points scored = 45 + x

total points scored = 45 + (points scored by missing members)

total points scored = 45 + (number of missing members times 0 points)

total points scored = 45

Now we can see that the total number of points scored by the team is 45, whether the missing team members actually showed up or not! Therefore, the total number of points scored is unknown at this point, but we can assume based on the information provided that it is simply 45.

In summary, here's how we solved the problem:

1. Identify how many team members did and did not show up. (5 present, 6 absent)
2. Calculate the number of points scored by the present team members. (45 points)
3. Assign a placeholder value (x) to the number of points scored by the absent team members.
4. Determine the relationship between the number of points scored by the present and absent team members. (x = points scored by absent team members)
5. Calculate the total number of points scored by the team by using the information we have about both the present and absent team members. (45 points)
6. Confirm that the total number of points scored matches what we actually expect (which, in this case, is 45.)

Let's represent the unknowns with variables.

?  A ! cats are Siamese at the pet store.
Let x = number of Siamese cats at the pet store.

? 13 cats in total at the pet store.
Let t = total number of cats at the pet store.

? 5 houses (homes) : cats (at the pet store).
Let h = number of houses (homes) at the pet store.

? During the sale, they sold 10 cats.
Let s = number of cats sold during the sale.

Now, let's create an equation using the information given:

t = x + 13 - s   (total number of cats is equal to the number of Siamese cats, plus the fixed number of non-Siamese cats, minus the number of cats sold during the sale)

Next, we'll find the relationship between x, h, and t:

h = 5 * \frac{x}{13}   (there are five homes for every thirteen cats at the pet store)

Substituting t from the previous equation,

h = 5 * \frac{x}{13} * \frac{100}{100 - s}   (there are five homes for every thirteen cats remaining after the sale)

Now, let's find the final number of cats after the sale:

t - s = x + 13 - s    (total number of cats before and after the sale are the same, subtract the number of cats sold)

Simplifying and solving for x:

t - 13 = x + 0    (there were originally 13 non-Siamese cats)

x = t - 13      (the number of Siamese cats is the difference between the total number of cats and the fixed number of non-Siamese cats)

Substituting x into the equation for h,

h = 5 * \frac{t - 13}{13 * 100 - s * 100}   (the final number of homes remains the same)

Now, we know both t and h, so let's find h in terms of t, and then solve for t:

h = 5 * \frac{t}{13 * 100 - s * 100}   (using the relationship between number of homes, number of houses, and number of cats)

Let's put our equation to the test:

? The final answer is [number of cats left at the pet store].

The final answer is:  The pet store has t = \frac{13 * 100 * h}{5} cats remaining after the sale, where h represents the number of houses (homes) at the pet store.</s>",8,8.0,5.0

1. We are given that Megan baked a total of 71 cupcakes for the school's bake sale.

2. Megan's brother Todd ate 43 of these cupcakes, leaving behind a total of 28 cupcakes for Megan (71 - 43 = 28).

3. We need to find out how many packages Megan could make if she puts 7 cupcakes in each package. 

4. First, let's find out how many cupcakes are in each package. Each package will have 7 cupcakes (given).

5. Now, let's find out how many packages Megan can make with the remaining cupcakes. Here, we have 28 remaining cupcakes.

6. The number of packages Megan can make is the same as the number of cupcakes she can put in those packages. Let's represent this by x.

7. The equation for this situation is: Number of cupcakes in the packages = Number of packages * Number of cupcakes in each package.

8. So, our equation would be: 7x = 28

9. To solve this equation, we can divide both sides by 7:

x = 28 / 7

10. Rounded to two decimal places, the answer is: x ≈ 4.00 cups.

11. Now, we have the number of packages Megan can make from the remaining cupcakes: 4 rounded up to the nearest integer is 5 packages.

12. If, in total, Megan made 71 packages (originally), and she's currently made 5 additional packages from the remaining cupcakes, then she's currently made a total of 76 packages.

13. The final answer is: Megan has made a total of 76 packages from the cupcakes she baked for the school's bake sale, with Todd consuming 43 of them.

<|assistant|>
Let's first define the exclamation mark notation: x! (read as x factorial) represents the product of all positive integers less than or equal to x.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. The original number of friends playing the game was ! 2, so we have ! 2 lives in total initially.
2. Two more players joined the game, increasing the total number of friends playing by 2. Therefore, the total number of friends playing the game now is ! (2+2), which is ! 4.
3. Each friend had 6 lives initially, so we multiply the original number of friends by 6 lives to get the initial number of lives.
4. In step 2, we increased the number of friends by 2. When we increased the number of friends, we want to keep the number of lives each friend has constant at 6. Therefore, we multiply the additional two friends by 6 lives to get the number of lives these two friends added.
5. Adding up the lives from steps 3 and 4 gives us the total number of lives.

In summary:

- Number of lives initially: ! 2 * 6 = 6!
- Lives from additional friends: 2 * 6 = 12
- Total number of lives: Initial lives + Lives from additional friends = 6! + 12

{The final answer is: The total number of lives is 72 (6! + 12).}</s>",24,24.0,12.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of socks Sam had originally as x.

When Sam threw away 3 old socks, he was left with x - 3 socks.

After purchasing 36 new socks, Sam's total number of socks became (x - 3) + 36.

We can write this as an equation:

(x - 3) + 36 = y

(Where y is the total number of socks Sam now has.)

We can now use the distributive property to combine like terms on the left of the equation:

x - 3 + 36 = y

x + 33 = y

At this point, we have isolated x for substitution into our original expression of x.

Substitute the value y - 33 into our original expression:

Sam's original number of socks was y - 33.

Now replacing the value of y in the original expression from Step 5, we get:

Sam's original number of socks was (y - 33) when he had 10 socks and threw away 3 old ones. Therefore, y = 33 + 10 = 43.

In the end, we conclude that Sam had 43 socks originally.

{The final answer is 43.}

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's break it down into a series of steps:

1. Wendy initially picked a total of 103 flowers for her friend's wedding.

2. Wendy was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one.

3. Before the wedding, 47 of the flowers wilted. So, the number of remaining flowers is 103 - 47 = 56.

4. We need to find out how many bouquets Wendy could still make with the remaining flowers. Let x be the number of bouquets she could make.

5. The number of flowers needed for each bouquet is 8. So, the total number of flowers required for all x bouquets is 8x.

6. We know that Wendy already used some of the flowers to make bouquets before the wilting, and that this number is represented by the expression 47 (since 47 flowers wilted).

7. So, the total number of flowers Wendy originally picked is the sum of the number of flowers she used to make bouquets before the wilting and the number of flowers she used to make bouquets after the wilting, plus the wilted flowers. This can be written as:
103 = 47 + 8x + 56

8. Simplifying this equation, we get:
103 = 8x + 103

9. Since an equation cannot contain identical terms on both sides, we need to get rid of the 103 on the right-hand side. To do this, we can subtract 103 from both sides of the equation:
  103 - 103 = 8x
  0 = 8x

10. This step is only to help us get rid of the right side's 103, and we know it cannot be true since it makes x equal to 0. By setting right side expression to 0, we are saying that the number of bouquets Wendy can still make with the remaining flowers is zero, which is not possible.

11. Hence, our original equation 103 = 8x + 103 doesn't have a unique solution for x. However, we can always solve equations in real situations with constraints, which give us different possible solutions.

12. Here, since we know that Wendy still needs to use up the remaining 56 flowers, but doesn't want to waste any more than needed, we can say there is a lower bound to the number of bouquets she could make. As long as the number of bouquets she can make is less than or equal to 7 (since 8 flowers in each bouquet - with some left over for display or decoration), she should be able to make enough bouquets.

13. The final answer is: Wendy could still make up to 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers. {The final answer is: Wendy could still make up to 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers.}</s>",7,7.0,7.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the relationships between the unknown variable ""?"" (which could be ""books"" or ""shares""), sold books, and new books using equations.

Let x be the number of books Adam originally had.
Let y be the number of books Adam sold.
Let z be the number of new books Adam bought with the money earned from selling y books.

We can set up two equations to represent the given information:

1. Adam originally had 48 books.
x = 48

2. Adam sold 19 books.
y = 19

3. Adam earned money from selling y books.
Let p be the price per book.
y * p = earnings

4. Adam used the money earned to buy z new books.
Let q be the price per new book.
z = earnings / q

5. After buying z new books, Adam had a total of 48 + z - y books remaining.
Let r be the remaining number of books.
x - y + z = r

Now we can substitute equations (3) and (4) into equation (5) to eliminate earnings:

x - y + z = r
x - y + y * p / q = r

To simplify the resulting expression, we can divide both sides by r and let s be the number of remaining books per dollar:

x * (1 - (1 - s) * y / x) + z * s = 48

To determine the final number of books Adam has, we can assign values to some of the variables in this equation. Let's say Adam sells $5 per book and he pays $8 per new book. Also, let's say Adam spends $0.80 on remaining books per dollar (i.e., s=0.80).

Substituting these values into the final equation:

x * (1 - (1 - 0.80) * 19 / x) + 38 * 0.80 = 48

To solve for x, we can use a calculator to iterate through a few possible values for x until we find one that satisfies the equation (rounded to the nearest integer). After some trial and error, we find that x ≈ 53.

So, the final answer is that Adam has approximately 53 books remaining. {The final answer is approximately 53 books.}</s>",67,67.0,53.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find the number of vans needed for Nancy's class field trip to the zoo, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to determine how many seats are available in each van. Since each van can hold 5 people and there are both students and adults going, we can't assume that all seats are taken up by students. Nevertheless, we know that there are 12 students and 3 adults going. Let's say there are x students and y adults per van. Then:

   - The number of seats occupied by students per van is x times 5 (number of seats per person).

   - The number of seats occupied by adults per van is y times 5 (number of seats per person).

   - The total number of seats per van is the sum of these two numbers.

2. The total number of seats on all vans (let's call this z) cannot exceed the total number of people going (n). Therefore, let's set up an equation that takes into account the variable x and the total number of students going:

   z = x times number of seats per student per van + y times number of seats per adult per van

   z = x times 5 + 3 times 5 (the number of seats per student and adult, respectively)

3. Next, we know the total number of students and adults going. So we can set up another equation, this time with the total number of people going (n) as the variable:

   n = x + (3 times 12) (students + 3 times the number of adults)

4. We now have two equations with two variables (x and n). Let's use these equations to substitute and simplify, in order to find the number of vans needed (let's say this is V). Note: In reality, there is no need to substitute either variable, as we only want to find the value of V. However, this step is key to solving systems of linear equations. So let's do it for practice.

5. From the equation with variable x, we can substitute the variable x by its equivalent from the other equation:

   z = (n - (3 times 12)) times 5 + (3 times 12) times 5

   z = n times 5 - 72 + 72

   z = n times 5

6. Now we can find V by dividing z by the number of seats per person per van (5):

   V = z divided by 5

   V = n divided by 5

7. The equation V = n divided by 5 means ""the number of vans needed is equal to the total number of people going divided by 5"". This simplified expression can be seen as the final answer.

8. Let's put our numerical values into the equation:

   V = 12*5 + 3*5 = 60

   We round this number up to 12, because we can't have a fraction of a van. So, Nancy's class will need 12 vans to go to the zoo.

   {The final answer is: Nancy's class will need 12 vans to go to the zoo.}

   Note: Keep in mind that step 5 is only used to solve systems of linear equations. After finding V, it is no longer needed and should be disregarded as it does not play a role in finding the answer.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the total number of sodas Tom bought.
   Number of regular sodas = 4
   Number of diet sodas = 52
   Total number of sodas = 4 + 52 = 56

2. Find the total number of diet sodas on each shelf.
   Since Tom bought a total of 52 diet sodas, let's divide them by the number of shelves to find the number of diet sodas on each shelf.
   Number of diet sodas per shelf = 52 ÷ (number of shelves)

3. Find the total number of regular sodas on each shelf.
   Since Tom bought a total of 4 regular sodas, let's divide them by the number of shelves to find the number of regular sodas on each shelf.
   Number of regular sodas per shelf = 4 ÷ (number of shelves)

4. Find the total number of sodas on each shelf.
   Add the number of regular sodas per shelf and the number of diet sodas per shelf to find the total number of sodas on each shelf.
   Total number of sodas per shelf = Number of regular sodas per shelf + Number of diet sodas per shelf

5. Check if the fridge can hold the total number of sodas.
   Compare the total number of sodas on each shelf with the maximum capacity of the fridge per shelf, which is 7.
   If the total number of sodas on each shelf is less than or equal to 7, then we can fit all the shelves with this number of sodas.
   If the total number of sodas on each shelf is greater than 7, then we cannot fit all the shelves with this number of sodas.

6. Calculate the number of shelves Tom can fill up.
   As there are a total of 56 sodas, divide this by the total number of sodas on each shelf to find out how many shelves we can fill up completely with this capacity.
   We can fill up (56 sodas) ÷ (total number of sodas per shelf) shelves completely.
   If there is any remaining capacity left in the last shelf, it's an added advantage.

7. Calculate the remaining sodas (the unsold sodas).
   As we have already found out how many shelves can be filled up completely, we can calculate the remaining number of sodas that will not be used.
   Total number of sodas - Total number of sodas filled up completely = Remaining number of sodas.

8. End with the final answer.
   {The final answer is}.

At the end, let's use the steps above in a systematic manner to solve the given problem.

Step 1:
Number of regular sodas = 4
Number of diet sodas = 52
Total number of sodas = 4 + 52 = 56

Step 2:
Number of diet sodas per shelf = 52 ÷ (number of shelves)

Step 3:
Number of regular sodas per shelf = 4 ÷ (number of shelves)

Step 4:
Total number of sodas per shelf = Number of regular sodas per shelf + Number of diet sodas per shelf

Step 5:
Check if the fridge can hold the total number of sodas.
If the fridge can hold the total number of sodas on each shelf, then we can fill all the shelves with this number of sodas. If the fridge cannot hold the total number of sodas on each shelf, then we cannot fit all the shelves with this number of sodas.

Let’s assume each shelf can hold 7 regular sodas and 35 diet sodas.
Number of regular sodas per shelf = 7
Number of diet sodas per shelf = 35
Total number of sodas per shelf = 7 + 35 = 42

Step 6:
We can fill up (56 sodas) ÷ (42 sodas per shelf) shelves completely.

Let's see how many shelves we can fill up completely.
Number of shelves = (56 sodas) ÷ (42 sodas per shelf)
Number of shelves = 1.33
As we can't fill up a fraction of the shelf, we should round down the number of shelves.
Number of shelves = 1

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can first find out how many apples were used in making lunches for the original 38 students. Each student got one apple, so we can set up an equation to find the number of apples used for the original 38 students:

38 students, each getting one apple:

38 students × 1 apple per student = Total number of apples used for original 38 students

Let x be the number of apples used. Then we have:

x = 38 (Substitute this into our next equation, since there's an overlap between the number of apples used in making lunches and the total number of apples.)

38 apples were used to make lunches for the original 38 students.

Now, let's find out how many apples they had in total before they bought more.

Total number of apples at the beginning:

? school cafeteria ? had 38 apples that were used to make lunches for the original 38 students, plus however many apples they had left over.

Let y be the number of additional apples they had at the beginning. Then:

y + x = Total number of apples at the beginning

Substituting in for x, we get:

y + 38 = Total number of apples at the beginning

Now, let's determine how many apples they had left over after buying more.

Number of additional apples bought:

They bought 28 more apples to supplement the apples they already had. Let z be the number of additional apples they bought. Then:

z = 28

Total number of apples they have now:

They have all the apples they had at the beginning, plus the apples they bought.

Let t be the total number of apples they have now. Then:

t = y + z

Substituting in for y and z, we get:

t = y + 28

Let's put it all together and find the number of apples they have now (after buying more).

t = y + z

t = y + 28 (Substitute in our equation for z.)

Total number of apples at the beginning = y + 38 (Substitute in our equation for x.)

Set these two equations equal and solve for y:

y = t - 28 (Set up a system of equations and solve for y)

Original total - 28 (From Step 2)

y = x + t - 28 (From Step 1 and Step 3)

Solving for y:

Substitute in our equation x = 38:

y = 38 + t - 28

y = t - 10 (Simplify.)

Adding 10 to both sides:

y + 10 = t

Substituting back in our original equation:

y + 10 = y + z

Subtracting y from both sides:

10 = z

So, the number of additional apples they bought is 10.

Now, we know the formula for t (the total number of apples they have now), as well as the formula for y (the number of additional apples they had at the beginning). Using those two, we can find out the number of apples they have now, after they bought more.

Final number of apples:

t = y + z

t = (Number of additional apples they had at the beginning) + (Number of additional apples they bought)

Let w be the total number of apples they have now. Then:

w = y + z

From our equation for z:

W = y + (Number of additional apples they bought)

W = (Number of additional apples they had at the beginning) + (Number of additional apples they bought)

This is our final equation, with all our variables substituted in. Let's simplify it and make it neater:

Final number of apples = Number of additional apples they had at the beginning + Number of additional apples they bought

The final answer is:

Final number of apples = y + z

This is just a restatement of the formula we found earlier, using w instead of t.

<|assistant|>
Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. First, let's identify the known quantities. Luke can carry 4 trays at a time (let's call this his ""carrying capacity""), and he needs to pick up a total of 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another table.

2. To calculate how many trips it will take to pick up the trays from the first table, we can divide the total number of trays by Luke's carrying capacity. That is,

   Number of trips for first table = Total number of trays / Carrying capacity

   Substituting in our numbers,

   Number of trips for first table = 20 / 4 = 5

3. Now let's do the same for the second table.

   Number of trips for second table = Total number of trays / Carrying capacity

   Substituting in our numbers,

   Number of trips for second table = 16 / 4 = 4

4. To find the total number of trips Luke will make, we add the number of trips for each table together.

   Total number of trips = Number of trips for first table + Number of trips for second table

   Substituting in our numbers,

   Total number of trips = 5 + 4 = 9

5. So, in total, Luke will make 9 trips to pick up all of the lunch trays.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations to represent the relationship between the number of apples left after lunch, the number of pies made, and the number of apples used to make those pies.

Let x be the number of apples left after lunch. Then the number of apples used at lunch is 96 - x, and the number of apples used to make pies is 6 times the number of pies made, or 6y.

We can represent these relationships in two equations:

42 students each took q apples, so 42q apples were given out at lunch.

96 apples were originally in the cafeteria.

42q + 6y + x = 96

This is our first equation. It tells us that the total number of apples left (x) after lunch together with the number of apples used to make pies (6y) and the number of apples given out at lunch (42q) adds up to the original number of apples in the cafeteria (96).

To find the number of apples left after lunch (x), we need to find a value for y, the number of pies made. To do this, we can write a second equation using the fact that each pie takes 6 apples.

Let p be the number of pies made. Then the number of apples used to make the pies is 6p apples, which we can represent using an equation:

6p = 6y

Solving for y in terms of p:

y = p

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (x and y). Before we manipulate the equations to find x, we can check that they're consistent and have a unique solution. To do this, we need to create variables (here, q and p) that we can manipulate and test our equations with. Then we can substitute these variables back into our equations to check that they still hold true.

First, let's create some test values for q and p.

Suppose we gave out 1 apple per student and made 24 pies (so, q=1 and p=24). Then we can substitute these values into our two equations:

42 * 1 + 6 * 24 + x = 96

Or,

42 + 144 + x = 96

Or,

x = 42

So for these values of q and p, the number of apples left after lunch is 42 (which seems unlikely, since there were originally 96 apples).

We can do the same thing with a different set of values, like q=3 and p=12. Here's our system of equations again:

42 * 3 + 6 * 12 + x = 96

Or,

126 + 72 + x = 96

Or,

x = 24

So for these values of q and p, the number of apples left after lunch is 24. This seems more plausible, but to be sure, we should find values that satisfy both equations. Here's how to do that, known as solving the system of equations.

First, let's manipulate our two equations to put them in a form that's easier to solve.

We can move the x term to the left side of each equation to get them in standard form (Ax + By = C) and then solve the system using substitution.

42q + 6y = 96 - x

Or,

42q - x = -6y

And,

6p = y

The variables q, p, and y all appear on both the right and left sides of these equations, so to solve them, we need to eliminate one (or more) variables in order to get a system with just two unknowns.

Let's eliminate q, by solving the second equation for y in terms of p, and then substitute this expression into the first equation to get a new equation that only involves x and p.

First, solve the second equation for y:

y = 6p

Now, substitute this expression for y into the first equation:

42 * 6p - x = -372

Or,

-252p - x = -37",9,9.0,37.0

<|assistant|>
To find out how many action figures Henry currently has, we can set up an equation using variables. Let x represent the number of action figures Henry has. Henry initially had 3 action figures, so we can write:

x = 3

Next, we know that Henry ultimately needs a total of 8 action figures for a complete collection. Let y represent the number of action figures Henry needs to collect in order to complete his collection. We can set up another equation using our knowledge:

y = 8

The total cost of an action figure is $6, so let's define a new variable c for this cost. Each action figure costs $6, so we can set up an equation for the total cost of all action figures Henry has and needs:

6x + 6y = total cost

We also know that Henry spent a certain amount of money and we want to find out how much more he needs to spend in order to complete his collection. We'll let z represent the total amount Henry has spent on action figures so far, and we'll define a new variable z1 to represent the additional amount he needs to spend to finish his collection. Our new equation is:

z + z1 = total amount spent

Now that we have all the variables established, we can substitute the values we know into our equations.

From our first equation, we know that x equals 3.

x = 3

Substituting this into our second equation, we get:

y = 8

Now let's find out how much Henry has already spent on his action figures collection. We can substitute the values we know into our third equation:

z + z1 = total amount spent

From our initial prompt, we know that Henry had enough money to buy 5 action figures, so let's say he spent $30 on his initial collection. Then, the variable z represents the remaining amount Henry spent before he stops collecting and reaches the total amount required (y action figures).

z = total amount spent on all action figures up to the point we stopped collecting

Next, we need to determine how much more money Henry needs to complete his collection. Once he has y new action figures, the total amount of money spent on the collection should be equal to the cost of all action figures (y + x) times the cost per action figure (c). Therefore, let's establish:

z1 = amount of money Henry needs to spend to complete his collection

Now let's solve for z1 by substituting our known values into the fourth equation, and equating it with our third equation to find a unique solution for z1:

z + z1 = total amount spent
6(x+y) + z1 = total amount spent

Again, from our given information, we know that initially Henry had 3 action figures, which cost $18 altogether ($6 for each action figure). After this, let's suppose we stopped collecting action figures, and this amount plus the remaining cost (z) is equal to the total spent at this point ($60). Then, the fourth equation is:

z = total amount spent on all action figures before we stopped collecting

6(x+y) + z1 = total amount spent
6(3+y) + z1 = 60

Now let's solve for z1. Starting by isolating the variable z1, we get:

z1 = total amount spent - (6(3+y) )
z1 = total amount spent - 21

The final answer is:

z1 = {The final answer is: $39}

This means that Henry needs to spend an additional $39 to complete his collection. The total amount spent will be:

z + z1 = {The final answer is: $95}

Adding the total amount spent after completing his collection (z + z1), we get:

z + z1 = 95
z + total amount spent - 21 = 95
z = 74

Thus, the total amount of money Henry spent so far on his action figures collection before stopping (z) is:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's first identify the unknowns. We know that Vanessa picked 17 carrots and her mother picked 14 carrots. We don't yet know how many good carrots were picked (represented by the ?) or how many bad carrots they had in total (also represented by the ?). 

Next, we can write a system of equations to help us reason through the problem. Let's call the number of good carrots picked by Vanessa and her mother x and y, respectively, and the number of bad carrots picked overall b. Then we can set up this system:

x + y = !17 (the number of carrots Vanessa picked is 17, with some of those being bad)
x + y - b = !14 (the number of good carrots her mother picked is 14, so we subtract the bad ones)

We also know that the total number of carrots picked is 31 (the number of good carrots they picked plus the bad ones). Using some algebraic manipulation, we can find an expression for b that substitutes into the other equations.

b = !31 - x - y

We have three unknowns, but a system with only two equations. So we need to find a way to eliminate one variable, in this case, let's eliminate y. 

First, subtract (x + y - b) from (x + y) to get:

0 = !17 - !14 + x

Now we can substitute the expression for b we found earlier:

0 = !31 - x - !14 + x

Subtracting x on both sides:

0 = !31 - !14

This tells us that the total number of bad carrots they have (represented by the unknown b) is 0! This doesn't make sense, since we know that some carrots were bad. 

There must have been a mistake in the problem, as the number of bad carrots can't possibly be 0. So we have one of our two systems of equations with too many unknowns. We need to find more information to help us reason through the solution.

Without additional context, we can't solve the system. However, we can reason through other possibilities. 

If we assume that Vanessa picked no bad carrots, then x = !17, and her mother's number of good carrots y becomes !14. But then, the number of bad carrots picked by her mother would be -24, since she picked negative (!14) carrots. This is not a valid solution, since we can't pick negative amounts of anything.

If instead we assume that her mother picked no bad carrots, then y = !14, and (by subtracting y from the number of carrots Vanessa picked) we get !31 total carrots, which is the same as !17 carrots good and !14 carrots bad. But again, this assumes that her mother picked a negative number of carrots, which is not valid.

In summary, given the information provided, this math problem has inconsistent or missing information, and cannot be solved. More context is needed to determine the number of good and bad carrots Vanessa and her mother picked. We cannot end with a clear final answer, {The final answer is}.</s>",7,7.0,14.0

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. There are a total of 60 (23 managers and 37 employees) people at the company picnic.
2. Of these, 23 are managers and 7 are managers' wives (or partners), so the total number of managers is 23, and the total number of spouses is 7.
3. Let x be the number of employees who decided to play volleyball. Then the remaining employees (37 - x) did not decide to play.
4. Since all the managers and all the employees' spouses decided to play, the number of people playing volleyball is:
23 managers + 7 spouses + x employees = total number of people playing volleyball
5. If we split into 6 teams of equal size, then the number of people in each team is:
total number of people playing volleyball / 6 teams = number of people on each team
6. Substituting the expression for the total number of people playing volleyball from Step 4 into Step 5, we get:
(23 managers + 7 spouses + x employees) / 6 teams = number of people on each team
7. Solving Step 6 for x, we get:
number of people on each team * 6 teams = 23 managers + 7 spouses + x employees
8. Subtracting the expressions for managers and spouses from Step 7, we get:
number of people on each team * 6 teams = x employees
9. Dividing both sides of Step 8 by 6, we get:
number of people on each team = x employees / 6
10. To find the value of x, we can choose any number of employees who decided to play volleyball and substitute it into Step 3 to get:
x employees = 37 - (23 + 7) employees who did not decide to play
11. Solving Step 10 for x, we get:
x employees = 37 - 30 employees (remember that we already count the 23 managers and 7 spouses among those who decided to play)
12. Simplifying Step 11, we get:
x employees = 7 employees
13. In terms of symbols, Step 12 becomes:
x = 7
14. Putting Step 13 and our expression for the number of people on each team from Step 9 together, we get:
number of people on each team = 7 employees / 6
15. To find the total number of people playing volleyball, we can calculate the product of the number of people playing volleyball per team and the number of teams:
number of people playing volleyball per team * number of teams = total number of people playing volleyball
16. Since we already found the number of people on each team in Step 14, we can substitute it into Step 15:
number of people playing volleyball per team * 6 teams = number of people on each team * 6
17. Combine Step 16 with Steps 4 and 9, we get:
(23 managers + 7 spouses + 7 employees) / 6 teams = number of people on each team
18. Simplify Step 17, we get:
23 managers + 14 employees = number of people playing volleyball
19. To get the total number of people playing volleyball, we can substitute the expressions for the number of managers and employees from Step 1 into Step 18:
23 (23 managers + 37 employees - x employees) / 6 teams + 14 employees = number of people playing volleyball
20. Solving Step 19 for the number of people playing volleyball, we get:
number of people playing volleyball = (23 * 17) / 3 employees / 6 teams
21. Putting Step 20 and our expression for the number of people playing volleyball per team from Step 15 together, we get:
(number of people playing volleyball per team * 6) / 3 = (23 * 17) / 6
22. Simplify Step 21, we get:
number of people playing volleyball per team = (23 * 17) / 9

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many brownies Tiffany still needs to make in order to have a total of 17 brownies. Once we know how many more brownies she needs, we can calculate how much flour she needs for those additional brownies.

Let x be the number of additional brownies Tiffany needs to make. We know that she originally baked 8 brownies and now she needs a total of 17 brownies, so:

8 brownies = original batch
17 brownies = original batch + additional batch (x brownies)

We can set up an equation to find the value of x:

8 = original batch
17 = original batch + x

We can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to find the equation with x as the variable:

9 = x

So, Tiffany needs to make 9 more brownies (a total of 17 brownies) to have enough for her party.

Next, we need to find out how much flour she uses for each brownie. We were given that Tiffany uses 8 cups of flour for each brownie, so let's call that 8c (to help us remember that it's cups).

Now let's find out how many cups of flour Tiffany used in the original batch:

8 brownies x 8 cups of flour per brownie = 64 cups of flour (Original batch)

Next, we need to find out how many cups of flour she used in the additional batch (x brownies):

x brownies x 8 cups of flour per brownie = x * 8 cups of flour (Additional batch)

Now let's combine the number of cups of flour used in the original batch and the additional batch (from step 2):

64 cups of flour (Original batch) + x * 8 cups of flour (Additional batch) = Total number of cups of flour needed for the party

Let's simplify this equation:

64 + 8x = Total number of cups of flour needed for the party

We have found the total number of cups of flour needed for the party, but we still don't know the value of x. However, we know that 64 is the number of cups of flour she used in the original batch, so we can substitute that into the simplified equation:

64 + 8x = Total number of cups of flour needed for the party

If we subtract 64 from both the left and right side, we get:

0 + 8x = Total number of cups of flour needed for the party - 64

We can simplify this equation further, because 0 + 8x = 8x:

8x = Total number of cups of flour needed for the party - 64

We can divide both sides by 8 to find out how many cups of flour she still needs:

x = (Total number of cups of flour needed for the party - 64) divided by 8

Now we have a formula to help us calculate how much flour Tiffany still needs! The final answer is:

{The final answer is: The number of additional cups of flour Tiffany needs is x = (Total number of cups of flour needed for the party - 64) divided by 8}</s>",72,72.0,8.0

<|assistant|>
To find the number of bad carrots, we need to first find the total number of carrots. We are given that Carol picked 38 more carrots than her mom, so we can set up an equation to find the total number of carrots.

Carol's number of carrots = 38 more than her mom's number of carrots

Let's represent the number of carrots picked by Carol as x and the number picked by her mom as m.

x = m + 38

Next, we know that only a certain percentage of the carrots were good. Let's call this percentage p.

Of the good carrots, 90% were good, and of the bad carrots, only 80% were good.

We can represent this mathematically with the formula:

(0.9 * p) + (0.8 * q) = total number of good carrots

Here, p and q represent the number of good and bad carrots, respectively. We know that the total number of carrots is 38 more than the number picked by Carol's mom, so we can set up another equation:

p + q = 38 (more)

Using the formula for good carrots, we get:

(0.9 * p) + (0.8 * q) = Carol's number of good carrots (let's call this c) + her mom's number of good carrots (let's call this m)

0.9p + 0.8q = c + m

Plugging the equation we found for the total number of carrots (x = m + 38) into the formula for good carrots gives us:

(0.9 * p) + (0.8 * q) = (0.9 * (m + 38)) + (0.8 * (38 - (m + 38)))

We want to solve for q, the number of bad carrots. Rearranging terms, we get:

q = (0.8 * 38) + [(0.9 * 38) - (0.9 * m) - (0.8 * 38)]/0.2

But we actually already have a relationship between m and x. Using that relationship, we can define another equation for m:

m = x - 38

Plugging this into our formula for the total number of good carrots (with some algebraic manipulation), we get:

(0.9 * (x - 38)) + (0.8 * (38 - (x - 38))) = Carol's number of good carrots (let's call this b) + her mom's number of good carrots (let's call this m)

0.9(x - 38) + 0.8(38 - (x - 38)) = b + (x - 38)

Again, solving for m gives us:

m = (0.9 * (38 - (b - (0.9 * 38)))) / (0.17)

To satisfy the constraint of only 38% good carrots, we can make the simplifying assumption that almost all of Carol's 38 extra carrots were good, so let's set b to be 38. This gives us:

m = (0.9 * 0) / (0.17) + 38

Finally, we have a relationship between x and m. Using this relationship, we can find x and then use our relationship between m and q to find q, the number of bad carrots.

The final answer is:

q = (0.8 * 38) + [(0.9 * 38) - (0.9 * (0.9 * 38 / 0.17)) - (0.8 * 38)]/0.2

After some simplification, we arrive at:

q = (0.9 * 0) / 0.03

So, there are approximately 30 bad carrots.

The final answer is: After cleaning the garden, Carol and her mom found approximately 30 bad carrots,",7,7.0,30.0

To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations using the given information.

Let x be the number of problems on each worksheet.

We know that the worksheet has 7 problems, so we have:

7 = x (Letting x be the number of problems on each worksheet)

The teacher had 17 worksheets to grade, and she had already graded 8 of them. Let y be the number of remaining problems the teacher has to grade.

We can write this information in terms of x and y:

8 = 8 * 7 (number of problems already graded)

y = (17 - 8) * 7 (number of remaining problems)

Substitute 7 for x in the equation for y:

y = (17 - 8) * 7

y = 9 * 7

y = 63 (The final answer is 63)

So, the teacher has 63 more problems to grade.

We also know that we can find x by substituting y in our initial equation:

y = (17 - 8) * 7

x = 7

This gives us:

x = 7

We can check if this is correct by substituting x and y into the initial equation:

(number of problems on each worksheet) = x

(number of problems already graded) = 8

(number of remaining problems) = y

(total number of problems) = x * 17 (number of problems on all worksheets)

(total number of problems) = 7 * 17

(total number of problems) = 119 (Letting x = 7 and y = 63)

This checks out, so we're confident in our solution.

In summary, there are 7 problems on each worksheet, the teacher had already graded 8 worksheets, leaving her with 9 worksheets to grade. Each of those 9 remaining worksheets has 7 problems, for a grand total of 63 remaining problems yet to be graded.</s>",63,63.0,63.0

Let's call the original 8 friends P1 through P8. After the two new players join, the total number of players is now 10.

Let's call the two new players N1 and N2.

Before the new players joined, each of the original 8 players had 6! lives, for a total of 6! * 8 lives across the group.

After the new players joined, each of the original 8 players still has 6! lives. That means P1 through P8 still have a total of 6! * 8 = 720 lives.

The new players, N1 and N2, each have their own unique set of lives. Since each player originally had 6! lives and there are now 2 more players, the total number of lives must be 6! * 2 + 720 to account for the new players. Let's call this number T.

Solving for T:

6! * 2 + 720 = 720

6! * 2 = 720 - 720 (subtracting the original 720 from both sides)

6! * 2 = 0

Since this would mean that the 2 new players somehow magically have 0 lives, we know that our assumption that each new player gets their own unique set of lives is wrong. Instead, let's assume that the group collectively decides to share the new lives evenly among all the players.

In that case, the two new players each have 360 lives, for a total of 720 lives among them. The original 8 players each now have 6! * 0.75 lives since each player sacrificed their original 0.25 lives to make up the difference.

The total number of lives across the entire group is now:

(6! * 0.75) * 8 + (360) * 2 = 720

We can verify that this works by making sure we're getting the same result:

6! * 0.75 * 8 + 360 * 2 = (6! * 0.75) * 10

With that in mind, the {The final answer is} is:

Each player, including the original 8 and the new players, now has 6! * 0.75 lives.</s>",60,60.0,0.75

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps, starting from the initial information provided.

1. At the arcade, Cody won 49 tickets.
2. Cody spent 25 cents on a game and won a beanie.
3. Later, Cody won 6 more tickets.

Now, we need to find out how many tickets Cody has in total.

Let's draw up a table to help us keep track:

| Event                                  | Number of Tickets Won                      | Cost (in Cents) |

| Cody won 49 tickets initially          | 49                                            |             0   |
| Cody spent 25 cents on a game and won a beanie | - (number of tickets required to win)        |  25              |
| Later, Cody won 6 more tickets         | +6                                            |             0   |

Let's fill in the first row of the table with the information we already have.

| Event                                  | Number of Tickets Won                      | Cost (in Cents) |
|:---------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|:-----------------:|
| Cody won 49 tickets initially          | 49                                            |             0   |

We need to figure out how many tickets Cody won when he played the game and won a beanie. We don't know how many tickets this required.

Let's call the number of tickets required to win the game X.

| Event                                  | Number of Tickets Won                      | Cost (in Cents) |

Now, we need to figure out how many tickets Cody has in total. Let's add up all the numbers to find out.

| Event                                  | Number of Tickets Won                      | Cost (in Cents) |

| Cody spent 25 cents on a game and won X tickets | -X                                            |  25              |
| Later, Cody won 6 more tickets         | +6                                            |             0   |

We can simplify the last line by noticing that X - X is just 0, and we shouldn't double count the 49 tickets Cody won initially.

| Event                                  | Number of Tickets Won                      | Cost (in Cents) |

| Cody won 49 tickets initially          | 49                                            |             0   |
| Cody spent 25 cents on a game and won X tickets | -X                                            |  25              |
| Later, Cody won 6 more tickets         | +6                                            |             0   |

Now, let's solve for X.

X + 49 + 6 = 0 (we subtracted the cost of playing the game)

X = -55 (we can't have negative numbers of tickets!)

So, there must have been an error in the problem. It's likely that when Cody played the game and won a beanie, he played multiple times and won more than 1 ticket each time.

Let's try modifying the table to reflect this:

Let's use the variable ""c"" to represent the type of candy Bianca received.

1. Bianca received a total of 78 pieces of candy (c).

   Bianca received 78 candy (c).

   ?  For . Halloween Bianca received 78 pieces of ? candy.

   c = 78

2. Bianca ate 30 candies (c).

   Bianca ate 30 candies.

   ? She ate 30 , pieces then ! placed the rest into piles with 8 ! in ! each ; pile. How many piles , could ? she make?

   c - 30 = x                    // The number of candies Bianca has left after eating 30 is x.

   3. Bianca created piles with 8 candies (c) in each pile (p).

   x was placed into piles with 8 candies in each pile (p).

   ? How many piles, could ? she make?

   8x = p                           // Bianca has x number of candies that she has then created piles with 8 candies in each pile.

   4. Simplify the equation.

   x = (p/8)                          // Bianca has x number of candies left, but since we know the number of candies in each pile and the total number of piles, we can find the number of candies left after eating 30.

   5. Substitute and solve for x.

   Substitute p into the first equation.

   c - 30 = (p/8)

   Multiply both sides by 8.

   72 - 240 = p

   ? She made 72 Halloween candies minus 240 candies that are equal to the ones she ate and distributed to her piles with 8 candies in each pile.

   There are 72 Halloween candies left that Bianca could distribute to her remaining piles.

   The final answer is: Bianca could make 9 piles with 8 candies in each pile left over.

   So, the total number of Halloween candies that Bianca had was: 78 - 30 + 72 = 100.</s>",6,6.0,100.0

To solve this problem, we first have to find the number of lives each of the original five friends had. We are given that each player had 8 lives, so the total number of lives for the original five friends was:

5 friends x 8 lives per friend = 40 lives

Next, we add the number of lives for the two additional friends to find the total number of lives for the entire group:

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the value of x in the formula for kid meals. Since free meals are offered for kids, x can be considered as 0. This means that adult meals cost $8 each, and kids eat for free.

2. Calculate the total number of adults and kids in the group. Out of a total of 11 people, 2 were kids. The remaining 9 people must be adults. Therefore, there are 9 adults and 2 kids in total.

3. Calculate the number of kid meals. Since we have 2 kids in total, and each kid eats for free (x = 0), there are no free meals for kids.

4. Calculate the total cost of adult meals. There are 9 adults in total. Each adult meal costs $8. Therefore, the total cost of adult meals is $72.

5. Find the total cost of the meal. Add the cost of adult meals and the cost of free kid meals (which is zero since we established that there are no free meals for kids) to get the total cost of the meal for the group.

Let's represent the number of books Roger had initially as x, the number of books he sold as y, and the number of books he bought with the money he earned as z.

First, we have the equation for the number of books he had at the beginning (x):

x = 25

Next, we have the equation for the number of books he sold (y):

y = 25 - x

Roger used the money he earned to buy z new books, and he also had some leftover money, which we'll represent as l. We can represent this with a system of two equations:

21 - x = l (1)
z = l/3 (2)

Now, we want to substitute the expression for l from equation 1 into equation 2 to eliminate l:

z = (21-x)/3

We can use this expression to find the number of new books Roger bought (z):

z = (21-x)/3

Next, let's find the expression for the total number of books Roger has after buying the new ones:

total number of books = x + z

Let's substitute the expression we found for z into this equation:

total number of books = x + (21-x)/3

Now, we can solve the new equation for x, and we'll get:

x = (360-108)/10 = 252

Putting it all together, Roger would have:

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, let's identify the unknown variable in this problem. The number of lives Wendy had after completing a hard part of the game is unknown, but we do know that she had 10 lives when playing the video game. Let's call this variable x.

2. Next, we can set up an equation to represent the situation when Wendy lost 6 lives in the hard part of the game. Using the fact that we don't know how many lives Wendy had to begin with, let's represent that as a variable (y). Then, the equation would be:

y - 6 = 4 (since Wendy had 4 lives left after losing 6)

3. Now, we can rearrange this equation to find the value of y:

y = 4 + 6 (since Wendy still had 4 lives after losing 6, and we know she originally had 10)

y = 10

4. Since we know the value of y, we can substitute it into our original equation to check our work:

10 - 6 = 4

5. Next, let's figure out how many lives Wendy gained from completing the next level. This information is represented by the variable z. To combine this new number of lives with the number of lives Wendy originally had (x), we can set up an equation using addition:

x + 37 = z

6. We're now ready to find out how many lives Wendy would have in total. To do this, we can combine all the equations and variables we have:

x - 6 = 4

x = 10

z = x + 37 (since z is the total number of lives Wendy has after completing the next level)

z = 10 + 37

z = 47

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, let's find the total number of players on the team. The new players is 48, and the returning players is 6, so the total number of players is new players (48) plus returning players (6). This gives us a total of 54 players.

Total number of players = New players + Returning players
       Total number of players = 48 + 6
       Total number of players = 54

2. Next, we need to find out how many players will be in each group. We're given that each group will have 6 players.

3. Now, we know that the coach put the players into groups with 6 players in each group. To find out how many groups there are, we can divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.

Number of groups = Total number of players divided by Number of players per group
       Number of groups = 54 divided by 6
       Number of groups = 9

Let's tackle this problem step by step.

1. Nancy started with 80 files on her computer. ({The initial number of files is 80}.)

2. She deleted 31 files, leaving her with 49 files in total. ({The remaining number of files is 49}.)

3. Nancy created folders with 7 files in each. Since she had 49 files remaining, we can divide this amount by 7 to find out how many folders she would need. {The number of folders is roughly 7 (49 ÷ 7)}

4. However, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This is because we can't create a fraction of a folder. Therefore, we can say that Nancy made around 7 folders (which would actually be 8 folders) to hold her remaining files as follows: {The number of folders is 8}.

5. In other words, Nancy ended up with 8 folders, each holding 7 files. This means that she now has a total of 56 files in her computer (7 x 8 = 56) distributed among the 8 folders. 

Therefore, Nancy now has 8 folders and a total of 56 files. {The final answer is: Nancy ended up with 8 folders and a total of 56 remaining files}.</s>",7,7.0,56.0

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Find the number of games left after the sale.
   Let x be the number of games left after Luke sold 19 of his 39 games.
   The equation for finding x is:
   39 - 19 = x 
   so, x = 20
   {The final answer is: 20 games were left un Sold}

2. Find the number of boxes used by Luke.
   Let y be the number of boxes Luke used to pack the remaining games.
   Since Luke put 4 games in each box, we can find y by dividing the number of remaining games by 4.
   y = total number of games remaining / 4 games per box
   y = 20 games / 4 games per box = 5 boxes
   {The final answer is: Luke used 5 boxes to pack the remaining games}

3. Find the number of games packed in each box (recall that Luke packed 4 games in each box).

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:

1. First, let's determine the number of students selected for the trivia teams, which we'll represent as N. There are a total of 65 students trying out, and 17 of them did not get picked. This means that N - 17 students were selected, leaving us with the equation N - 17 = 65 - 17, which simplifies to N = 48. {The final answer is 48.}

2. Next, we'll find the number of students on each of the trivia teams, which we'll represent as x. We're told that there are 2 trivia teams, but we don't know yet how many students are on each team. To find out, we'll use the fact that there are a total of N students on both teams, which is represented by 2x = N, or x = N/2. Plugging our value for N from Step 1, we get x = 48/2 = 24. {The final answer is 24.}

3. Now that we know the number of students on each team, we can find the number of students remaining, which we'll represent as y. Since there are a total of 65 students trying out, and we've already accounted for the 48 students on the trivia teams, the remaining students are represented by 65 - (48 + 24) = y. Simplifying, we get y = 13. {The final answer is 13.}

4. Finally, we're given that the remaining 13 students are put into 8 groups, and we want to find out how many students would be in each group. Let's represent the number of students in each group as z. Using the concept that there are a total of 13 students in all 8 groups, we can find z by dividing 13 by 8. So, z = 13/8 = 1.625, but since we can't have a fraction of a student in each group, we need to round up or down depending on the precision required. If we're required to have an exact value for z, then we'll round up to 2 students in each group (since 1.625 rounded up is 2). If we're instead required to have a more approximate value for the number of students, then we can round down to 1 student in each group (since 1.625 rounded down is 2). {The final answers depend on the required precision level.}


5. Overall, the answer to the question is that if 17 students did not get picked for the school's trivia teams, then the remaining 48 students are divided into 2 teams of 24 students each, leaving 13 students remaining. These remaining students are then put into 8 groups, where we might have 2 students in each group if we require an exact answer, or 1 student in each group if we're looking for a more approximate answer.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's represent unknown quantities with variables. Let's say x is the number of pictures in each album, excluding the one with 10 pictures.

We know that the total number of pictures uploaded by Isabel is 25, and this number can be split into two sets: one set with 10 pictures and another set with (25-10) = 15 pictures.

Let x be the number of pictures in each of the 5 remaining albums. Then, the total number of pictures in the 5 remaining albums is 5x.

We also know that the total number of pictures in all 6 albums is 25. Combining this with the expressions we just created, we have:

25 = 10 + 5x

We can now isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

25 - 10 = 15 + (-10) + 5x

15 = -10 + 5x

We apply the rule for solving equations with subtraction: change the sign of x.

-15 = -2x

Now, we divide both sides by -5 to solve for x:

3 = x

Since we're solving for the number of pictures in each of the 5 remaining albums, we should keep the algebraic variable x.

So, the number of pictures in each of the 5 remaining albums is x = 3.

Therefore, the final answer is:

{Each album with the exception of the one with 10 pictures contains 3 pictures.}</s>",3,3.0,3.0

                     Mike made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 26 dollars weed eating. If ! he only spent 5 dollar . a week, how long would ? the money last him? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find out how long Mike's money will last him, we need to determine how many dollars he has in total and how much he's spending each week. Let's call the total amount of money M and the weekly spending P.

We know that Mike made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 26 dollars weed eating, for a total income of 40 dollars. This gives us:

M = 40 dollars

Now let's find out how much Mike spent on lawn-mowing. His income for lawn-mowing is 14 dollars, and we know that Mike spent only 5 dollars a week. Let's call the number of weeks it took to mow all the lawns m. From here, we could derive a formula for M(Mike's income) as a function M=14m, where m is the number of weeks he mowed the lawn:

M = 14(m) dollars

We can calculate how many days it took him to weed eat all the areas by finding out how much money he spent on it in relation to how much he made. His income for weeding eating is 26 dollars. Since we know his total income is 40 dollars, this tells us that he spent some of his income from mowing lawns to weed eat, and we don't know how long that took. Let's call the number of weeks it took to weed eat all the areas w.

Then, P=5 dollars/week is his weekly lawn-mowing expenses. We assume that Mike didn't spend money on weeding eating the first five weeks, so the money spent on weeding-eating for the first five weeks is zero. After the first five weeks, he starts to weed eat and spends the remaining income for mowing lawns.

From this we find out the relation between dollars spent on weed eating and the remaining dollars for lawn mowing:

W = 0 dollars in the first five weeks

P(m) + (M - 14(m)) * (w-5) / (4-1) = 5 dollars/week

Now let's find a general formula to calculate the weekly expenses.

Since m is the number of weeks for mowing lawns, and w is the number of weeks for weeding eating. The total number of weeks required to finish both tasks is the greater of the two, which is denoted by t.

t = max(m, w)

We calculate the total income I = M dollars and the total expenses E = (P(m)*m + (M - 14(m))*(w-5)/(4-1))*min(m, w) + (P(m)*w + (M - 14(m))*(w-5)/(4-1))*(t-m) dollars.

Next, we calculate the number of dollars left after payments, which is our final answer.

F = I-E

So, the final answer is F = I-E.

In our case, m=? Weed-eating started precisely at the 6th week.

To calculate m, we need to set up the system of equations:

5*5 + (40-14)*(w-5)/(4-1) = 25 dollars

And:

t*P(m) + (t-m)*[(M - 14(m))*(w-5)/(4-1)]*[(P(m)*m + (M - 14(m))*(w-5)/(4-1))*(m-w)]/[(m-w)*(4-1)] + (P(m)*w + (M - 14(m))*(w-5)/(4-1))*(t-m) = 0 dollars.

We then substitute the unknown values m, w, and t into the system of equations and solve it.

Finally, let's find the number of weeks it will take MIke to run out of money while assuming that his work continues as we assumed. That's a new variable we call N.

E = F

I - (P(m)*m + (M - 14(m))*(w-5)/(4-1))*(m-w)/(t-1) = 0 dollars

Now, we have a formula:

N = t if E=0, otherwise we need to find an equation to calculate the exact",8,8.0,0.0

                     Vanessa had 16 music files and 48 video files on her flash drive. If she deleted 30 ? of the files, how many files , were ? still on , her flash drive? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to use mathematical reasoning and algebraic expressions.

Step 1: Let x be the number of files (both music and video) that Vanessa deleted. We can express the original number of files as follows:

   number of files originally = 16 + 48 = 64

Step 2: The new number of files on the flash drive is the original number of files minus the number of files that Vanessa deleted. Let's call this new value n.

   n = 64 - x

Step 3: The number of music files that Vanessa originally had is 16. After deleting some of these files, there will be a new number of music files left on the flash drive. Let's call this new value m.

   m = 16 - (x - (16/48)*x)

   Explanation:

   Vanessa had a total of 16 music files originally. After she deleted some files, there are going to be fewer music files (m). We can calculate the number of music files left like this:

   Starting point: There are 16 music files originally. Some of them were deleted (let's say it's x).

   Desired outcome: We want the final number of music files on the flash drive (let's say it's m).

   Equation: If there are x deleted music files, how many music files (m) will still remain on the flash drive after the deletion?

   We can think of the music files as being split into two groups: deleted and not deleted.

   Deleted: There are x deleted music files. These are some of the original 16 music files.

   Not Deleted: The remaining music files are (16 - x).

   Relationship: The proportion of the not-deleted music files out of the total music files originally is: (Original # of music files - # deleted) / (Original # of music files)

   Calculate: (16 - x) / 16

   Now we can substitute this proportion back into our equation:

   m = 16 - (x - (16/48)*x)

Step 4: We can find the value of x by setting up and solving an equation.

   First, let's find the expression for the deleted files (x) in terms of n. We do this by subtracting the new number of files on the drive (n) from the original number of files (64), and remember that x of those are deleted:

   x = 64 - n

   We can substitute this expression into our expression for m:

   m = 16 - ((64 - n) - (16/48)*(64 - n))

   Algebraic step: distribute the multiplication:

   m = 16 - (64 - n) + (384/48)*(64 - n)

   Simplify:

   m = n - (16/3)*(n - 16)

   Step 5: Now we can have all the expressions available and use them to find the final value of n and m.

   First, we need to find the value of x, which in turn gives us a value for n.

   Substitute the value of m into the original expression for m:

   n = 64 - (16 - (x - (16/48)*x))

   Simplify:

   n = 64 - 16 + (x/48)*x

   Algebraic step: factor:

   n = 48*(64/48 - (1/48)*x)

   Step 6: Solve for x:

   The expression n, in terms of x, represents the number of files remaining on the drive. The expression for n tells us how many files remain when a certain number of files (x) have been deleted, and it gives us some flexibility as we can think of different scenarios of how many files were deleted. Substitute the expressions for x and n into the equation for m:

   Set m = x:

   x = m - (16/3)*(m - 16)

   Step 7: Finally, find the value of x and substitute it back",34,34.0,7.0

To solve this problem, let's identify the variables and create an equation for the total number of shirts washed before school started.

Let x be the number of short sleeve shirts washed before school started.
Let y be the number of long sleeve shirts washed before school started.

We know that Dave had to wash a total of 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts before school started. This gives us two separate equations:

x + 9 = short sleeve shirts washed before school started
27 + y = long sleeve shirts washed before school started

Now, let's create an equation for the scenario where Dave washed only 20 shirts before school started. We'll call this scenario s.

x + y = 20 (in scenario s)

To find the number of shirts that Dave did not wash before school started, we need to find the total number of shirts that were washed before school started, and subtract the number that were washed.

First, we find the total number of shirts that were washed before school started in our original scenario. Add the short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts that were washed:

x + 9 + 27 + y = total number of shirts washed before school started

Next, we find the total number of shirts that were washed before school started in scenario s:

x + 9 + y = 20

Now, we subtract the total number of shirts that were washed before school started in scenario s from the total number of shirts that were washed before school started in our original scenario:

x + 9 + 27 + y - (x + 9 + y) = total number of shirts washed before school started (in original scenario) - total number of shirts washed before school started (in scenario s)

Simplify:

x + 27 = short sleeve shirts not washed before school started (in original scenario)

Finally, solve for x to find the number of short sleeve shirts that were not washed before school started:

x = short sleeve shirts not washed before school started - 27

{The final answer is:} The number of short sleeve shirts that were not washed before school started is equal to the difference between the total number of short sleeve shirts not washed before school started and the number of long sleeve shirts washed before school started (when Dave washed only 20 shirts). After substituting the original equations for x and y into this formula, we can calculate the exact number.

However, instead, let's continue by finding the number of long sleeve shirts that were not washed before school started.

We know that Dave had a total of 27 long sleeve shirts washed before school started in our original scenario. When he washed only 20 shirts before school started in scenario s, he did not wash all of the long sleeve shirts. How many were left over?

27 - y = long sleeve shirts not washed before school started (in original scenario)

{The final answer is:} The number of long sleeve shirts that were not washed before school started is equal to the difference between the total number of long sleeve shirts not washed before school started and the number of long sleeve shirts washed before school started (when Dave washed only 20 shirts). After substituting the original equations for x and y into this formula, we can calculate the exact number.

By combining these two formulas, we can find the total number of shirts that Dave did not wash before school started:

x + 27 = short sleeve shirts not washed before school started (in original scenario)
27 - y = long sleeve shirts not washed before school started (in original scenario)

To find the total number of shirts that Dave did not wash before school started, add the short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts that were not washed before school started:

short sleeve shirts not washed before school started + long sleeve shirts not washed before school started = total number of shirts that Dave did not wash before school started

This simplifies to:

(x + 27) + (27 - y) = total number of shirts that Dave did not wash before school started

Simplify:

27 + x - y = total number of shirts that Dave did not wash before school started

To put this all together:

x = short sleeve shirts not washed before school started - 27

3. Find the time it takes to cook the remaining potatoes.
   - Since we have already calculated the cooking time for each potato, we know that it takes 3 minutes to cook one potato.
   - To find the time it takes to cook all the remaining potatoes, we can multiply the number of remaining potatoes with the cooking time per potato:
     - Time to cook remaining potatoes = 2 potatoes x 3 minutes per potato = 6 minutes

   (x + y) - z . Total number of pictures left
   (x . 41 + y . 29) - z . Using algebraic properties, we can move the -z inside the parentheses.
   x . 41 + y . 29 - z . Using algebraic properties, we can distribute the -z to both terms inside the parentheses.

4. Now, let's replace the variables with the given quantities in the initial problem. We know that gwen took .41 pictures at the zoo and 29 at ! the : museum and deleted 15 pictures.
   gwen took .41 pictures at the zoo (x = .41)
   gwen took 29 pictures at ! the : museum (y = 29)
   gwen deleted 15 pictures (z = 15)

5. Substituting our expressions for x, y, and z into the equation we found in step 3, we get:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let x be the number of days until there are no more puppies left in the shelter. 

When there are 2 puppies at the shelter, we can create an equation to represent this situation:

2 = 34 - x (Number of puppies at the shelter) = Number of puppies brought in - Number of puppies at the shelter (Later number of puppies - Initial number of puppies)

We can simplify this equation:

2 = 34 - x

Next, we want to create an equation that represents the decrease in the number of puppies due to adoptions. Since 4 puppies are adopted per day, we can create an equation:

Number of puppies adopted per day = 4

Let y be the number of puppies adopted in x number of days. Then, we can create an equation to represent this situation:

y = 4x

Let's combine these two equations using the ""= "" sign. We can represent this as a system of linear equations:

2 = 34 - x  (Equation 1)

y = 4x  (Equation 2)

We can then eliminate a variable by manipulating the equations to create another equation with either x or y as the only unknown.

Let's multiply Equation 2 by -1/4 and substitute it into Equation 1:

2 = 34 - (-1/4 * y)

Next, let's multiply Equation 1 by -1/34:

-1 = -x/34 - (-1/34 * y)

Finally, to get x alone on the left-hand side of the equation, let's add Equation 2 to the equation above:

0 = -x/34 + (1/34 * y)

Let's multiply both sides by -34 to write the equation in the form of x = value:

x = -y/34

Now we have an expression for x in terms of y. We know that we want to find out how many days it takes for all the puppies to be adopted, meaning x = 0. Plug -y/34 into our expression for x until x becomes equal to 0:

0 = -y/34

Multiply both sides by -34:

y = 0

This means that when 0 puppies are left to be adopted, there are 0 puppies being adopted per day. This is an impossible scenario because there can't be less than zero puppies to be adopted. This indicates that there is some mistake in the given information.

In other words, we're trying to find out when x = 0, which is when all the puppies have been adopted. However, it's impossible for x to be negative or zero because it represents the days until there are no more puppies left. Therefore, without knowing more information, it's not possible to calculate when all the puppies would be adopted.

   Had! 59 = 59!* = 13312020969762561912140816961439361729600

2. Next, we're told that Had put 32 clothes in one ! load. Again, to calculate this, we use the fact that a factorial represents the product. Here, we have:

   32! = 5,120

3. Now, let's see how many clothes were left after Had finished washing the clothes in the first load. For this, we subtract the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes.

   Total clothes - clothes in first load = Clothes left

   Substituting our known values, we have:

   Had! 59 - 32! = Clothes left

   Simplifying this expression, we get:

   (Had! 59 - 32!) = Clothes left

4. Next, we're told that Had decided to split the remaining clothes into 9 equal loads, each containing the same number of clothes.

5. To find how many clothes go into each of the small loads, we divide the number of clothes left by the number of small loads. Here's how to do it:

   Number of clothes left: Clothes left

   Number of small loads: 9

   Number of clothes in one small load: Clothes left / 9 (note that this will be a decimal value because we're dividing by 9 and getting an integer answer)

   Now, we'll convert this decimal value to the nearest integer value to get a whole number of clothes. Let's round this to the nearest integer using the rule: if the decimal is 4 or less, round down, and if it's 5 or greater, round up.

   Number of clothes in one small load: Nearest integer value = Round(Clothes left / 9)

   Therefore, we have our answer. The final answer is:

   The nearest integer value for the number of clothes in each of the small loads is:

   Round(Clothes left / 9)

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break this down into smaller, more manageable steps.

1. We know how many boxes of each candy Adam bought. Let's call the number of chocolate boxes bought by Adam as C, and the number of caramel boxes bought by Adam as K.

2. We are also given the number of pieces in each box, which is 4. Let's call the total number of pieces of chocolate candy as Pc, and the total number of pieces of caramel candy as Pk.

3. Now, let's calculate how many pieces of each candy type Adam has. We know that each chocolate box has 4 pieces, so C boxes of chocolate would contain C * 4 pieces. Similarly, each caramel box contains 4 pieces, so K boxes of caramel would contain K * 4 pieces.

4. Adding up the number of pieces of chocolate and caramel that Adam has gives us the total number of pieces of candy, P.

5. Pc is found by multiplying the number of chocolate boxes, C, with the number of pieces in a chocolate box, 4.

6. Pk is found by multiplying the number of caramel boxes, K, with the number of pieces in a caramel box, 4.

7. Putting it all together, the number of pieces of candy Adam has is:

P = Pc + Pk

      = C * 4 + K * 4

      = 4 * (C + K)

8. As we have been given that Adam bought 2 boxes of chocolate candy, and 5 boxes of caramel candy, let's use this value in Step 1.

      C = 2

      K = 5

9. Plug those values into Step 7 to find the number of total pieces of candy Adam has.

      P = 4 * (C + K)

      P = 4 * (2 + 5)

      P = 48

10. Now we can convert the number of pieces back into boxes if we want to - we know that Adam has 4 pieces per box, and he has 48 pieces total.

      Let's call the number of chocolate boxes he has left as Nc (we know he has already bought 2 of them).

      Let's call the number of caramel boxes he has left as Nk.

11. To find how many chocolate boxes Adam has left, let's find out how many chocolate pieces are left after already having Pc pieces (from Step 3).

      Nc * 4 = Pc - 48

      Nc * 4 = 4 * (2 - [the number of chocolate boxes he bought initially + the number of chocolate boxes he has left])

      Simplifying, we get:

      Nc = [-48 + 8(C)] / 12

12. Similarly, to find how many caramel boxes Adam has left, let's find out how many caramel pieces are left after already having Pk pieces.

      Nk * 4 = Pk - 48

      Nk * 4 = 4 * (5 - [the number of caramel boxes he bought initially + the number of caramel boxes he has left])

      Simplifying, we get:

      Nk = [-48 + 8(K)] / 12

13. We're almost there - to make this calculation complete, we now know exactly how many boxes of chocolate and caramel Adam still has, we've calculated the total number of pieces he has and how many have been used up to arrive at this point. However, we have yet to calculate how many pieces of chocolate he has in total. We'll call this value PcNc.

14. PcNc is found by multiplying the number of chocolate boxes Adam still has as Nc, with the number of pieces in a chocolate box, which is 4.

15. We have just calculated how many caramel boxes he still has as Nk, and we found earlier that the total number of caramel pieces is Pk.

16. Let's now calculate how many caramel pieces Adam still has in total. We call this value PkNk.

17. Putting it all together, the total number of candy pieces Adam now",28,28.0,17.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first need to identify the unknown variables. Here, ""April's ? discount"" refers to a discount for April's flowers, but we don't know what that discount is, so that is our first unknown variable. Next, we know that each flower is sold for a certain number of dollars, but we don't know what that number is, so that's our second unknown variable. Let's call this number ""x."" Finally, we know that Katie bought a certain number of flowers and spent a certain amount of money, but we don't know how many flowers she bought of each type or exactly how much she spent, so we'll make Katie's spending the third unknown variable, and let's call it ""y.""

Now, let's look at the information we have:

1. April's flowers have a discount, but we're not sure what that discount is. Let's assume the discount is ""d"" and calculate the price of each flower without the discount:

   - Without the discount, each flower costs x.
   - With the discount, each flower costs (x - d) after the discount is applied.
   - Let's calculate the price of a single rose:

   Rose price = (x - d)

   Note that the price of each flower can be calculated in the same way, no matter what type of flower it is.

2. The price of a single rose is reduced by the discount when it's part of Katie's purchase. Let's calculate the price of a single rose for Katie:

   - One rose costs (x - d) if April is selling them, but Katie gets the discount, so the price is actually (x - d) - d = (x - 2d).

3. Katie buys some roses and some daisies, but we don't know how many of each she buys initially. Let's say Katie buys r roses and d daisies.

4. We also know that the total amount Katie spends on her purchase is y.

5. Let's calculate the total cost of Katie's rose purchase:

   - The price of a single rose is (x - 2d).
   - Katie buys r roses, so the cost of the roses is (x - 2d) * r roses.

6. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Katie's daisy purchase:

   - The price of a single daisy is x, since these aren't on sale.
   - Katie buys d daisies, so the cost of the daisies is x * d daisies.

7. Adding up the costs of the roses and daisies from above, we get a total cost for all of Katie's flowers:

   - Katie's total flower cost is (x - 2d) * r roses + x * d daisies.

8. Finally, we know that Katie spends a total amount of y on her purchase. We can use this to calculate the ""price of discounted flowers"" value, d:

   - Katie spends y dollars.
   - Of that, we know how many dollars were spent on the discounted flowers (because we know how many flowers were purchased, but we don't know how much each of them cost).
   - Similarly, we know how many dollars were spent on the non-discounted flowers.
   - To calculate d, we need to find how many dollars are being spent (by Katie) on the discounted flowers:

   d = Discount spent by Katie on roses

   - To calculate this, let's first calculate how many roses Katie bought before the discount:

   K = Number of roses Katie bought before the discount

   - We know that r roses were bought after the discount, so the total number of roses Katie bought (before and after the discount) is K + r roses.
   - Furthermore, we know that each flower was originally priced at x dollars.
   - So, before the discount, the roses cost K * x dollars, and after the discount, they add (r - K) * (x - d) to the total cost, where (r - K) represents the excess number of roses that Katie bought after the discount (since we don't yet know how",60,60.0,8.0

                     At the schools book fair Victor bought 32 adventure books and ? 37 mystery books. If 16 of the books were used, how ; many new books did he buy? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use a systematic approach by first identifying the known and unknown variables. Let's call the number of new mystery books bought as x.

Given information:
- Number of adventure books bought by Victor = 32
- Number of mystery books bought by Victor = 37 - x (since we don't know how many mystery books were already used)
- Total number of books used = 16

We can represent this in equations:
- Number of adventure books = 32
- Number of mystery books = 37 - x
- Total number of books used = 16

In order for Victor to have bought more new books (after using 16), we need to find the value of x that results in more new books being purchased.

To calculate the number of new adventure books bought (after subtracting the ones that were used):
- New adventure books = 32 - 16 = 16

Then, we can calculate the number of total new books purchased by subtracting the new mystery books from the total new books and adding the new adventure books:
- Total new books = 16 + (37 - x)

Now let's set up an equation to determine the total number of books bought by Victor:
- Total number of books bought by Victor = Total new books + Number of mystery books used + Number of adventure books used
- Total number of books bought by Victor = 16 + (37 - x) + 16
- Total number of books bought by Victor = 37 - x + 32
- Total number of books bought by Victor = 69 - x

Now we need to determine how many more new mystery books we want Victor to buy, so as to have more total new books. Let's say we want Victor to buy y more new mystery books, and we subtract them from the new mystery books:
- New mystery books = x - y (where y is a positive integer)

Now we can calculate the total number of new books:
- Total number of new books = 16 + (x - y)

Next, let's set up an equation to match the original condition where the used books are 16:
- Used books = Total number of books bought by Victor - Total number of new books
- Used books = 69 - x - 32 - (16 + (x - y))
- Used books = 16 - y

Since we want more new books to be purchased, y has to be a positive integer. So, this equation means ""The number of used books should be less than or equal to 16"".

Now let's find the values of x and y for when Victor buys y more new mystery books:
- Total number of new books = 16 + (x - y)
- Used books = 16 - y

Now we can make a table comparing different values of y:
|y| Total number of new books | Number of mystery books | Number of adventure books | Total number of used books |
| 0                     | 16                      | x                          | 32                       | 16                      |
| 1                     | 32                      | x - 1                       | 31                       | 15                      |
| 2                     | 34                      | x - 2                       | 29                       | 14                      |
| 3                     | 36                      | x - 3                       | 26                       | 13                      |
| ...                            | ...                       | ...                          | ...                       | ...                      |

From this table, we can see that the number of new adventure books (which are 16 and common across all scenarios) remain constant while the number of new mystery books (which depend on y) can be adjusted up or down. So, to meet the condition of more new books purchased, we pick a value of y such that the total number of new books obtained is greater than the total number of used books.

Let's pick y = 2. With this choice, we get x = 33. 

Now we can reconstruct the scenario:
- Number of adventure books bought = 32
- Number of mystery books bought = 37 - 33 (new mystery books) = 4
- Total number of books bought by Victor = Total number of new books",53,53.0,4.0

Let's represent the number of carrots Maria had originally with the variable x, the number she threw out on the first day with y, and the number she picked the next day with z.

On the first day, Maria had x carrots. She threw out y of them, leaving her with x-y carrots.

On the second day, she picked up z more carrots, so her total number of carrots is (x-y) + z.

We're given that when Maria threw out 11 carrots on the first day, she had 48 carrots. So, x-y = 48, and y = 37. (We subtracted 11 [the number of carrots she threw out] from 48 to find the number of carrots left, and then found y by subtracting this number from the number of carrots she had originally.)

On the second day, Maria picked up 15 more carrots, so z = 15.

Putting it all together, we have:

(x-37) + 15 = total number of carrots

Let's reorganize it and use the fact that we know the total number of carrots:

x = total number of carrots - 15 + 37

x = total number of carrots + 22

The final answer is x, the total number of carrots Maria has. So, the final answer is, {The final answer is the total number of carrots Maria has when she picks up x carrots, throws out 37 of them on the first day, and picks up 15 more on the second day.}</s>",52,52.0,15.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the situation using algebraic expressions. Let x be the number of roses she sold initially, and y be the number of roses remained after selling x roses. Similarly, let z be the number of roses picked later. Now, the expression to find the number of roses she had at first is:

50 = x + y

After selling x number of roses, she sold 15 more roses (15 is represented with an exclamation mark in the question). So, the total number of roses sold is (x + 15). To find the number of roses she had leftover after selling (x + 15), let's call it z, where z = y - (x + 15). After that, she picked 21 more roses. The final number of roses she has is then:

(x + 15) + 21 = z

Substituting y - (x + 15) for z, we get:

(x + 15) + 21 = y - (x + 15)

Simplifying the expression, we get:

y = x + 36

Let's replace y in the initial equation, and solve for x:

50 = x + (x + 36)

Now, let's isolate x to find the number of roses she had initially.

50 = 2x + 36

50 - 36 = 2x

24 = 2x

To find the number of roses she had initially, we divide 24 by 2:

x = 12

The final answer is: {The florist had 12 roses initially.}</s>",56,56.0,12.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first need to find the number of math problems Isabel had on each page. Since she had 2 pages of math homework and there were !5 problems on each page, we can find this using multiplication:

2 pages with !5 problems on each page = 2 !5 problems in total

Next, we need to find the number of reading homework pages Isabel had. We know that she had 4 pages of reading homework, but we don't know how many problems were on each page. However, we know that she completed a total of !5 math problems and !5 reading problems. We can use this information to set up a system of equations to find the unknown values:

Math problems:    2 !5 = x (where x is the number of math problems she completed)
Reading problems:  4 : x = y (where y is the number of reading problems she completed per page of reading homework)

To solve for x, we can substitute y into the equation for reading problems, giving us:

Math problems:    2 !5 = x
Reading problems:  4 * (x / y) = y (where y is now a function of x)

We can now rearrange these equations to form a system:

Math problems:    2 !5 = x
Reading problems:  4 * (x / y) = !5

We know that we want to find the total number of problems Isabel had to complete, so we'll add up all the numbers from x, y, and the math and reading problems we've already found:

Total problems:      x + !5*y = z (where z is the total number of problems Isabel had to complete)

To solve for z, we can substitute our systems for x and y into the equation for z:

Total problems:     2 !5 * ((4 * !5) / (2 !5)) = z

Now, we can simplify this expression using the rules of exponents:

Total problems:     !5 * !3 = z

To find the value of z, we can simply calculate the product of !5 and !3:

Total problems:    (!5) * (!3) = z

Our final answer is:

{The final answer is: !5 * !3 = 15 * 3 = 45 problems}

Note that since we ended the final expression with a complete answer, it is not necessary to use {The final answer is} again. However, in cases where we have nested expressions, it's a good practice to clarify that the final expression represents the final answer.

For the next part of this problem, we can also find the number of math problems Isabel completed per page by dividing the total number of math problems (found earlier) by the number of math pages she had:

Math problems per page:     !5 * 2 = x

And, we can find the number of reading problems she completed per page by dividing the total number of reading problems (found in the system of equations) by the number of reading pages she had:

Reading problems per page:     !5 * (4 / x) = y

Note that we need to be careful about which expression for x to use here, since we previously solved for x using the math problems. By using the math problems from the first part of the problem, we have already completed those problems, and they do not show up again in this part. When solving complex problems with multiple parts, it is essential to keep track of the expressions that have already been solved and how they are related.

By adding both parts together, we can also find the total number of problems Isabel completed, including the math and reading problems she already found:

Total problems:     x + !5*y = z
                    (where x, y, and z are the math and reading problems and the final answer we found earlier)

<|assistant|>
Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 4 friends playing the video game online. Each friend had 3 lives, so the total number of lives was 12 (4 friends times 3 lives).

2. Five more players joined the game, making a total of 9 (5 joined friends plus the original 4) players.

3. We don't know how many lives each new player had, so let's call this number ""x"".

4. If we add up the number of lives all players have now (after the new players joined):

    Total number of lives now = Old number of lives (12) + New number of lives (9x)

5. Solving for x:

    Total number of lives now = Old number of lives (12) + New number of lives (9x)

    x = (Total number of lives now - Old number of lives) / 9

    Substituting numbers:

    x = ((New number of lives) - (Old number of lives)) / 9

      New number of lives = 9 (old number of lives) + 12 (original number of lives)

      New number of lives = 21

      Old number of lives = 12

      Substituting into the formula:

      x = ((New number of lives) - (Old number of lives)) / 9

      x = ((21) - (12)) / 9

      x = 9

6. Therefore, each new player has 9 lives.

7. Putting this together, we have a total of 9 x 5 new players, who each have 9 lives, plus the original 4 players, who each have 3 lives:

    Total number of lives = 4 (original players) x 3 (original lives) + 9 (new players) x 5 (new players)

    Total number of lives = 36 (original players) + 40 (new players)

    Total number of lives = 76

    There are 76 lives in total.

                     Kaleb . had 12 dollars. If he . spent 8 ? bucks ! on a new : game, how many 2 dollar toys could ? he , buy , with the : money ? he had left? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's call the number of toys Kaleb can buy with the remaining money x.

When Kaleb bought the new game for 8 dollars, he had 12 - 8 = 4 dollars left.

To find how many 2 dollar toys he can buy with this remaining money, we can write this as an equation:

4 dollars = x * 2 dollars (where x is the number of toys)

We can divide both sides by 2 to isolate x:

4 / 2 = x

Simplifying, we get:

x = 2 (which is the value of 2 dollars)

So, Kaleb can buy 2 toys with the remaining money.

Putting it all together, we can write:

The final answer is: Kaleb can buy 2 toys with the remaining money. 

Therefore, in total, Kaleb bought one new game for 8 dollars and 2 toys for 2 dollars each, for a total of 10 dollars spent. This leaves him with only 2 dollars remaining, which won't buy any more toys. So, in total, Kaleb bought a total of 3 items for 12 dollars.</s>",2,2.0,12.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
First, we need to find out how many math problems Katie had based on the given information. Katie had 7 pages of math homework, and each page had 9 math problems. So, the number of math problems that Katie had to complete is 7 pages multiplied by the number of problems per page, or 7 times 9. This calculation gives us 63 math problems in total.

Similarly, we can find out how many reading problems Katie had. She had 3 pages of reading homework, and each page had 9 reading problems. Multiplied together, this gives us 27 reading problems in total.

We can now add the number of math problems and reading problems Katie had to complete. Using addition, we get:

63 math problems + 27 reading problems = 80 total problems

So, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} 80 total problems.

Alternatively, we could have formed an expression using variables to represent the number of pages and problems for each subject. This would look like:

Number of math problems = pages * problems per page
Number of reading problems = pages * problems per page

Using this method, we could have set up a system of equations to represent Katie's homework:

7 pages of math homework     =    number of math problems

3 pages of reading homework =   number of reading problems

This system would involve solving two equations with two unknowns (the number of math and reading problems). However, as the number of pages and problems per page are known, we can simplify the equations, making one of the variables unnecessary. This leads to the same solution found in the first method, as explained above.

In either case, the final solution is 80 total problems, which is the complete answer to the original homework problem.</s>",90,90.0,80.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find the total number of songs that Janet bought, we need to first determine the number of songs in each type of album. We are given that each country album has 9 songs with a lyric sheet, and each pop album has an unspecified number of songs with a lyric sheet. 

Let's assign a variable x for the number of songs on each pop album. We know that Janet bought 2 pop albums, so the total number of songs on all 2 pop albums is 2x. 

Next, we know Janet bought a total of 6 country albums. Each country album has 9 songs, and we can assume that all country albums come with a lyric sheet as this information is provided. Therefore, we can find the total number of songs on all 6 country albums by multiplying the number of albums (6) by the number of songs on each album (9). This gives us a total of 54 songs from country albums. 

Adding the number of songs from the pop albums and the country albums, we get the total number of songs Janet purchased. 

Total number of songs bought = Number of songs from country albums + Number of songs from pop albums

                               = 54 songs (from country albums) + 2x songs (from pop albums)

                               = 54 + 2x (total number of songs bought)

To solve for x, we can isolate it on one side of the equation. 

                               = (54 - 2 * 6) songs (from country albums) + (2x) songs (from pop albums)

                               = 48 songs (from country albums) + (2x) songs (from pop albums)

                               = (2x) songs (from pop albums)

                               = (2 * x) songs (from pop albums)

                               = x songs (from each pop album)

Now we know that Janet bought a total of (54 + 2 * x) songs. Since we want to know the exact number of songs bought, let's round the answer to the nearest whole number.

Final answer: Janet bought approximately (54 + 2 * 20) songs, for a total of approximately 94 songs.

{The final answer is approximately 94 songs.}</s>",72,72.0,94.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Jerry made a total of $14 dollars mowing lawns and $31 dollars eating weed in a certain time period. Let's call this amount x. Therefore, x = 14 + 31 = 45 dollars in total earnings.

2. Jerry spent $5 dollars a week on other expenses, which is 5x weeks' worth of expenses. So, we have 5x = spending (in weeks).

3. We want to find out how many weeks this spending would last him. Let's call that n.

4. Since we have an equation with x and no equation with n, we need to eliminate x to find a solution with just n. To do this, we need to find x in terms of n.

5. We know that x is the total amount of earnings in steps 1 and 2, combined. So, we can write:

x = 14 + 31 - 5n

6. In step 1, x is also the total amount of earnings he made for doing lawns and weed eating. So, 14 and 31 must be the amount Jerry made for doing those jobs separately.

7. Let's call the amount Jerry made per lawn mowing j, and the amount he made per weed eating l. That means 14 = j lawns and 31 = l weed (since there's only one unit of measurement missing, it's safe to assume that these are in number of lawns/weed, rather than dollars).

8. So, we can write:

x = j lawns + l weed - 5n

9. Substitute j lawns and l weed from step 7 into equation (1) in step 5:

x = 14 + 31 - 5n

j lawns + l weed - 5n = 14 + 31 - 5n

10. Simplify this equation by collecting like terms:

(j - 5) lawns + (l - 5) weed last for n weeks.

11. To find how many weeks n is, we must solve for n in terms of (j - 5) lawns and (l - 5) weed:

n = (j - 5) / (j - 5) - (l - 5)

This formula is called Kram's rule, which is used to determine the number of weeks a fixed income will last.

12. In this case, n is our unknown. Since we're only interested in n, let's simplify this formula to find n as follows:

n = (j lawns + l weed - 10) / (5j - 25)

13. Now we have a formula using j, l and their corresponding workloads j lawns and l weed. It gives us the number of weeks n that his income will last with given expenses.

14. Let's calculate this using the original values:

n = (14 lawns + 31 weed - 10) / (5(14) - 25)

n = (45 - 10) / 30

n = 3.5 weeks

15. Since we can't have a fraction of a week, let's round off this to the nearest week - which is 4 weeks.

16. Therefore, if Jerry ; spent $5; a ; week ; , his ; income ; from lawn ; mowing ; and ; weed ; eating ; would ; last ; him ; for ; 4 ; weeks ; .

The final answer is: Jerry's income from lawn mowing and weed eating, after deducting his weekly expenses of $5, would last him 4 weeks.</s>",9,9.0,4.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we'll use a step-by-step approach. Let's begin!

Step 1: Keep the main expression clear
First, let's separate the problem into its separate components to make it easier to understand and solve.

Adam had 33 books.
He sold 11 of them, which means the number of books he had left after the sale is:
- 33 original books
- 11 books sold
- Total books left = 22 (33 - 11)

Next, Adam earned some money by selling those 11 books. We'll represent this amount by a variable $S$. Later, we'll use the ! symbol to indicate that the amount was earned by selling these 11 books. This leaves us with two cases:

- If Adam didn't spend any of the money earned from selling those books, there's no need to buy any new books. Therefore, the number of books Adam would have in this case would simply be the number of books he has left after selling them: 22.

- If Adam did spend some of the money earned to buy new books, let's represent how many new books Adam bought by the variable $N$. The cost of these new books is represented by a variable $C$, which we'll also indicate by ! because it came from selling the 11 books.

Step 2: Determine the cost of buying new books
Now we know how many books Adam bought, how many original books he has left, and how much money he spent buying new ones. Using this information, we can calculate the cost of buying those new books:

- The cost of each book is the same as it was before selling some of them, namely $1.
- Let's represent the total number of Adam's original books, including the ones he has left after selling 11 of them, by the variable $B$. After all, the number of books we're talking about includes both the original books he initially had and the ones he bought.
- Using our representation of Adam's remaining books ($B$), we can find out how many of those remaining books Adam bought ($N$). We'll represent it using the formula $N=0.71B$. In other words, Adam bought about 71% of his remaining books.
- Now that we know how many new books Adam bought, we can find out the cost of these new books ($NC$). It's represented by the formula $NC=C$.

Step 3: Calculate how many books Adam has now
Finally, we can calculate how many books Adam has now. This is represented by the variable $T$, which takes into account both the original books Adam had and the new ones he bought:

- The total number of books Adam has now ($T$) is calculated as follows: it's the total number of his original books ($B$) plus the number of new books he bought ($N$): $T=B+N$.
- Using our representation of the number of new books ($N$), as well as our original representation of the number of original books ($B$), we plug them both into this formula to calculate the total number of books Adam has now ($T$).

Step 4: Show the final answer
Putting it all together:
- We know that Adam had $33$ original books ($B$).
- After selling $11$ of them, Adam has $22$ books remaining ($B-11$).
- Adam earned $S$ dollars by selling those $11$ books, which he spent some of to buy $23$ new books ($N=0.71B$) for a total cost of $C$ dollars ($C=NC$).
- Now Adam has $T=B+N$ total books, meaning our final answer is: If Adam had $33$ books, sold $11$ of them for $S$ dollars, earned $S$, spent $C$ of it to buy $23$ new books, leaving $S-C$ dollars, then Adam would have $T$ books now, where $T=22+0.71\times(33-11)$. The final answer is: $T=33-11-\frac{0.71}{0.29}(S-C)$.

<|assistant|>
Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. First, let's define our variables. Let's call the number of cans Kaleb picked up in total X. The number of bags Kaleb filled on Saturday was B1, and the number of bags Kaleb filled on Sunday was B2. The number of cans in each bag on both Saturday and Sunday was C.

2. We're given that Kaleb was collecting cans for recycling. Let's say this happened on a specific day, and to keep the story simple, let's call this day ""Saturday"". We're also given that Kaleb filled 5 bags on Saturday and filled 5 more bags on Sunday. We can represent this mathematically as:

   B1 = 5
   B2 = 5

3. Next, we're given that Kaleb filled up the bags on Saturday. Let's say that each bag contained C cans. We know that Kaleb filled a total of 5 bags on Saturday, so we can represent this as:

   B1 * C = N1
   
   Where N1 is the total number of cans collected by Kaleb on Saturday. Let's use the distributed law to calculate N1:

   N1 = B1 * C

4. Moving forward, we're given that on Sunday, Kaleb filled B2 more bags. We also know that each bag on Sunday contained C cans. Therefore, the total number of cans collected by Kaleb on Sunday is:

   B2 * C = N2

5. Now we know how many cans were collected on both Saturday and Sunday. To find out how many cans Kaleb picked up in total, we can add N1 and N2:

   X = N1 + N2

6. Let's substitute our previous calculations into this equation:

   X = B1 * C + B2 * C

7. This is a linear equation with variables B1, B2, C, and X. To solve for X, we can use algebraic methods, such as the substitution method, the elimination method, or the graphing method.

8. To use the substitution method, we can substitute the values of B1, B2, and C into the equation. Let's say C was 4. We would then have:

   X = 5 * 4 + 5 * 4

9. This simplifies to:

   X = 20 + 20

10. By calculating each term separately, we see that X is indeed 40, which is the total number of cans Kaleb picked up. Using algebraic methods, we can also calculate the exact value of X given specific values of B1, B2, and C.

11. Here's an example: using our previous notation, let's say that B1 was 3, B2 was 7, and C was 2. Using the substitution method, we can calculate X as follows:

   X = 3 * 2 + 7 * 2

12. This simplifies to:

   X = 6 + 14

13. By calculating each term separately, we see that X is 20, which is the total number of cans Kaleb picked up. In summary, the first problem was broken down into smaller steps that could be easily understood and solved. By working through each step, it's clear how the answer was derived. {The final answer is:} 40, which is the total number of cans Kaleb picked up.</s>",40,40.0,40.0

To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps. Here’s how:

1. First, let’s find out how many books are on the mystery shelves:
   - If Nancy has 2 shelves of mystery books and each shelf has exactly 6 books, then she has 2 shelves with a total of 6 books on each shelf. This means she has a total of 12 books on the mystery shelves.
2. Next, we need to find out how many books are on the non-mystery shelves:
   - She has 6 shelves of non-mystery books, and each shelf has exactly 6 books (the same as on the mystery shelves).
   - So, she has a total of 6 shelves with a total of 6 books on each shelf. This means she has a total of 36 books on the non-mystery shelves.
3. Adding the total number of books on the mystery shelves and on the non-mystery shelves, we get the total number of books that Nancy has:
   - So, the total number of books is 12 (from step 1) plus 36 (from step 2), which equals 48 books.
4. Putting this all together, we can say:
   - If Nancy had 2 . shelves of mystery books and 6 shelves . Of : picture . Books, , then she had a total of 48 books {The final answer is}.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many 5-dollar toys Paul can buy with the total amount of money he has.

Let's call the number of toys Paul can buy x. We know that each toy costs 5 dollars, so Paul has spent 5x dollars on toys so far.

Let's also remember that Paul had originally saved up 3 dollars and received an extra 7 dollars for his allowance, for a total of 10 dollars. In total, Paul now has 10 + (7 - 5x) dollars, where the -5x represents the remaining allowance money that hasn't been spent on toys yet.

We can set these two amounts equal and solve for x:

10 + (7 - 5x) = 3 + 5x

We can collect like terms:

10 + 7 - 5x = 3

We can add 5x to both sides:

10 + 7 = 8 + 5x

We can subtract 10 from both sides:

-3 = -3 - (-5x)

We can multiply both sides by -1:

3 = 5x

Using integer multiples, Paul can buy exactly 0.6 toys, which is not possible since we cannot buy and sell frails of toys. Since we cannot have a decimal number of toys, we would round down to 0 toys. Alternatively, we can state that Paul cannot buy any toys with this amount of money.

{The final answer is Paul cannot buy any toys with this amount of money.}</s>",2,2.0,0.0

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of lives Wendy had before losing 8 in variable L.

L - 8 (Losing 8 lives)

Let's call the number of lives Wendy gained in the next level N.

L + 39 = N (Gaining 39 lives in the next level)

Now, we want to find out the total number of lives Wendy will have after gaining 39 lives. 

Let's call this variable T.

L + N = T (Total number of lives Wendy will have)

Substituting the value of N in terms of L and 39, we get:

L + 39 = T

Substituting the value of L from the first equation, we get:

L - 8 + 39 = T

L - 8 + 39 - 39 = T - 39 (Subtracting 39 from both sides)

L - 8 = T - 39

L = T - 39 - 8 (Moving -8 to the right side)

L = T - 47

Now, we can write the final answer as:

{The final number of lives Wendy has is equal to the total number of lives T she has, subtracted by 47.}

In other words,

Number of lives Wendy has = Total number of lives T - 47.

To find the total amount Will earned in the two-day period, we can calculate the earnings from each day separately and then add them up.

On Monday, Will earned $8 per hour for the 8 hours worked, for a total of $64 on that day (8 hours at a rate of $8/hour).

On Tuesday, Will earned $8 per hour for the 2 hours worked, for a total of $16 on that day (2 hours at a rate of $8/hour).

Adding up the earnings from both days, we can see that Will made a total of $80 ($64 on Monday and $16 on Tuesday) during those two days. So the final answer is {The final answer is $80}.

We could also calculate Will's weekly wage ($728) and then subtract the amount earned from Tuesday ($16) to find how much Will earned from Monday alone. The same method can be applied to find the earnings on each day as separate steps to help understand the process better.

On Monday, Will earned $728 - $16 = $712 for the week. As he worked 8 hours on Monday, the wage per hour comes out to be $89 ($712 / 8). Since Will worked for 8 hours, he earned $8 for 8 hours. So, the earnings on Monday is $64 ($8 per hour * 8 hours).

On Tuesday, he earned $16 ($8 per hour * 2 hours). 

Summing up the two days' earnings, we get $80 ($64 on Monday and $16 on Tuesday).

Hence, the total earnings for those two days is $80.

Both methods arrived at the same answer.</s>",80,80.0,80.0

Let the number of cupcakes Carol made be x.

1. Carol made x cupcakes for the bake sale. (Given)
2. Carol sold 6 y cupcakes. (The question uses ""?:"" as a placeholder for a value that is not explicitly stated, so we can't be sure of the value of y. We'll just write y here)
3. After selling 6 y cupcakes, Carol still had x - 6y cupcakes left over. (Number of cupcakes before selling minus number of cupcakes sold)
4. Carol then made 27 new cupcakes, bringing the total to x - 6y + 27. (Steps 2 and 3)
5. The total number of cupcakes Carol had after making more is z.
6. To find z, we set the total number of cupcakes Carol had after making more equal to the total number of cupcakes she had before, which is x.
7. Solving for z, we get:
   z = x - 6y + 27
   z = x - 6(number of cupcakes sold) + 27
   z = x + 11(number of cupcakes sold remaining to be determined)
   
   Final Answer: Carol would have z cupcakes, {The final answer is: }z = x + 11y

Question: How many cupcakes would Carol have in total if she sold all but 9 of those she made?

8. To find the number of cupcakes sold, we know that Carol sold all but 9 of the total cupcakes she made.
   Let's call the number of cupcakes Carol sold x1.
   Then, the remaining ones left over would be 9.
   x1 - 9 = x

   So, x1 = x + 9

9. Substituting (8) into (7), we get:
   z = x + 11y
   z = x + 11(x + 9 - x)
   By the distributive property, this means z = x(1 + 11*1/(-1)) + 119
   We can simplify further by factoring out x:
   z = x * (1 + 11)
   z = x*12
   Final Answer: Carol would have z = x*12 cupcakes, {The final answer is:} z = 12x

Question: How many cupcakes would Carol have in total if she sold twice as many as she made?

10. When Carol sold twice as many cupcakes as she made, the number sold, x2, was twice the number she made, x.
   
   x2 = 2*x

11. Using the result from question 9, we know z = x * 12.

12. Substituting (10) into (11), we get:
   z = x*12
   z = (2*x) * 12
   By the distributive property, this means z = 24x

To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. Let's first find the number of team members who showed up for the game. 

   Number of team members who showed up = 14 - 7 (number of members who didn't show up)

   Number of team members who showed up = 7

2. We know that each member who showed up scored 5 points.

   Points scored by members who showed up = 7 * 5 (number of members who showed up times the number of points scored by each member)

   Points scored by members who showed up = 35

3. Now we have to find the total number of points scored by the team during the game.

   Total points scored = Points scored by members who showed up + Points scored by members who didn't show up (assuming the members who didn't show up still scored some points)

   Total points scored = 35 + (7 * x) (where x is the number of points scored by each member who didn't show up)

4. Let's substitute (7 * x) with the expression we derived in step 2:

   Total points scored = 35 + (7 * (5 - 5)) (Each member who didn't show up still scored 5 points, but we're subtracting those points because we already accounted for them when finding the points scored by team members who showed up. )

   Total points scored = 35 + 0

   Total points scored = 35

5. Therefore, we've found that the team scored a total of 35 points during the game.

To solve this word problem, we can break it down into smaller steps.

1. There were A teams, each with 5 members, for a total of A x 5 = trivia teams. (Note: The problem doesn't define the meaning of ""trivia,"" so we'll assume it's just a label for the number of teams.)

2. During the game, 2 members of each team that did show up didn't show up. Let's call this event ""x"" happened.
   - In other words, there were originally A x 5 members for each team, and for each team that did show up, we subtract 2 for ""x"" happening, leaving A x 3 members.

3. Each team member who did show up scored 6 points. (I'll use the variable ""p"" to represent this score.)

4. Calculate the total number of points scored by all team members who did show up (p x numbers of team members who did show up).
   - The number of team members in total is A x 3, since 2 didn't show up.

5. Combine the above two calculations to find the total number of points scored by all team members.

So, let's step through the solution:

Step 1:
A x 5 = trivia  (Equation 1)

Step 2:
- For each team: 5 original members.
- During the game: subtract 2 for ""x"" happening, leaving A x 3 members.

Step 3: 
Let's let ""p"" represent the score of each team member who did show up.

Step 4:
- For each team that did show up: p x (A x 3) members.

Step 5:
Combine total points from all teams:

Total points scored = p x (A x 3) for each team that showed up
    [A-1 teams showed up, since we're subtracting 2 per team for ""x""]

    + p x (A-2) for each team that showed up (2 team members didn't show up)
    + p x (A-3) for each team that showed up (2 team members didn't show up, and 1 additional team member didn't show up)

    + … until A-A teams that showed up (no ""x"" happened for these teams)

    + p x (trivia - A) for all teams that didn't show up due to ""x"" happening.

If we replace all instances of ""p"" and the A's with concrete numbers, we can work through our steps to find the solution. Based on the original instructions, we can't assume any values for ""A,"" ""trivia,"" and ""p.""

The final answer is: 

?

When we have concrete values for A, trivia, and p, we'll know the final answer for the total number of points scored by all team members who showed up and didn't show up due to ""x"" happening.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify the known variables:
   - There are 46 books in total
   - A librarian takes 10 books and leaves the rest for Oliver
   - Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf

2. Find the number of books left for Oliver:
   - Number of books left for Oliver: 46 - 10 = 36 books

3. Calculate the number of shelves needed, assuming each shelf can fit 4 books:
   - Number of shelves needed: 36 books ÷ 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves

   {The final answer is: Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away the remaining 36 books after the librarian takes 10 of them.}

Alternatively, you could also use the formula for dividing by a decimal (dividing by 0.25 in this case, since there are 4 books per shelf):

4. Calculate the number of shelves needed using a formula:
   - Number of shelves needed: 36 books ÷ (4 books per shelf) = 9 shelves

   {The final answer is: Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away the remaining 36 books after the librarian takes 10 of them.}

Explanation:

We begin by finding the number of books left for Oliver: 46 books - 10 books taken by the librarian = 36 books left for Oliver.

Next, we determine the number of shelves needed using Oliver's method of fitting 4 books per shelf. We divide the number of books left for Oliver by the number of books fit on each shelf:

36 books left for Oliver ÷ 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves needed.

Alternatively, we could use a formula for dividing by a decimal. We divide the total number of books left for Oliver by the number of books fit on each shelf (where 4 books per shelf is equivalent to 0.25 books per shelf inch):

36 books left for Oliver ÷ (4 books per shelf) = 9 shelves needed.

Both methods yield the same answer: Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away the remaining books after the librarian takes 10 of them.</s>",9,9.0,10.0

Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Luke was [what?] putting his spare change into [what?] piles. [We don't know yet.]
2. He [what?] had [what?]. [Again, we don't know yet.]
3. There are [how many?] piles of [what?] (quarters or dimes). [There are 5 piles of each.]
4. Each pile has [how many?] coins![of what?]. [Each pile has 3! coins, and they could be quarters, dimes, or a combination of both.]
5. How many ! coins does he have total?

Let's assign variables for clarify:

- q: number of quarters Luke has
- d: number of dimes Luke has
- x: number of coins (quarter, dime, or a combination of both) in one pile
- q': number of piles with quarters
- d': number of piles with dimes

Now we're ready to fill in the blanks:

1. Luke was counting his spare change into piles. (The fact that he's ""putting"" his change into piles is irrelevant.)
2. He has a total of x coins. (Both quarters and dimes could have been used; that's why we use a different variable x.)
3. There are 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes. (Now we're talking about specific types of coins.)
4. Each pile has 3x coins. (We don't know whether these coefficients are for quarters or dimes. They could be both.)

Now that we have all the variables in place, we can combine the statements above to get the answers we need. Here's how:

1. To find the number of piles with quarters, we divide the total number of quarters by the number of coins in each pile:
   - q' = q / (3x)
   - Note that we're multiplying by 3x to account for the fact that each pile has that many coins (x).
2. Similarly, to find the number of piles with dimes, we divide the total number of dimes by the number of coins in each pile:
   - d' = d / (3x)
3. Now that we know the number of piles with each type of coin, we can find the total number of coins Luke has:
   - Total coins = q' * 3x + d' * 3x
   - Note that each pile has 3x coins (x coins could be quarters, dimes, or a combination of both), and we multiply this by the number of piles of that type (q' or d') to get the total number of coins for that type.
4. Finally, we can replace the variables with the actual numbers we're given:
   - total coins = (quarters / (3 * !)) + (dimes / (3 * !))
   - Note that both q and d are divided by the number of coins in each pile (3 * ! [exclamation points]) as well as we're multiplying by this number to get the total number of coins.

In other words:

- Luke had 5 * ! piles of quarters and 5 * ! piles of dimes, with each pile having 3 * ! coins.
- The total number of coins Luke had is:
  - (quarters / (3 * !)) + (dimes / (3 * !)) = (Luke's total number of quarters) + (Luke's total number of dimes) / (total number of coins in each pile)
  - Final answer: {The total number of coins Luke had is (Luke's total number of quarters) + (Luke's total number of dimes) / (3 * !)}</s>",30,30.0,3.0

To find out how many points Gwen and her friends earned for recycling, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of ! points earned by Gwen:
   - Gwen recycled 5. Pounds: 5 pounds = 1.67 kg (converting pounds to kilograms)
   - For every 3 pounds (1.33 kg), Gwen earned 1 ! point
   - Therefore, Gwen earned ! points for recycling 5. Pounds (which is 1.67 kg)
   - 1.33 kg / 3 kg = 0.44 points per kg
   - 1.67 kg x 0.44 points per kg = 0.75 ! points earned by Gwen

2. Calculate the number of ! points earned by Gwen's friends:
   - Gwen's friends recycled 13 pounds: 13 pounds = 5.94 kg
   - For every 3 pounds (1.33 kg), Gwen's friends earned 1 ! point
   - Therefore, Gwen's friends earned ! points for recycling 13 pounds (which is 5.94 kg)
   - 5.94 kg / 3 kg = 1.98 points per kg
   - 13 points per friend

3. Add the number of ! points earned by Gwen and Gwen's friends:
   - ! points earned by Gwen: 0.75
   - ! points earned by Gwen's friends: 13
   - Total ! points earned by Gwen and Gwen's friends: 13.75

4. Divide the total ! points earned by the total number of friends:
   - Total ! points earned: 13.75
   - Total number of friends: ? (this is what we are trying to find)
   - We can set up an equation to find the unknown variable:
   - Total ! points earned / Total number of friends = Average number of ! points per friend
   - 13.75 ! points earned / Total number of friends = Average number of ! points per friend

5. Solving for the unknown variable:
   - Total number of friends = Total ! points earned / Average number of ! points per friend
   - Total number of friends = 13.75 ! points earned / (Total ! points earned / Total number of friends)
   - Cross-multiplication gives: Total number of friends = 13.75 ! points earned x Total number of friends / Average number of ! points per friend
   - 13.75 ! points earned x Total number of friends / 13.75 = Total number of friends

6. Simplification:
   - Total number of friends = Total ! points earned / Average number of ! points per friend

7. Final answer:
   - The final answer is: ?
   - To find out the exact number of friends, substitute the values found earlier into the equation:
   - Total number of friends = 13.75 ! points earned / Average number of ! points per friend
   - Total number of friends = 13.75 ! points earned / (13.75 ! points earned / Total number of friends)
   - Cross-multiplication gives: Total number of friends = 13.75 ! points earned x Total number of friends / Total ! points earned
   - Simplification: Total number of friends = Total ! points earned / Average number of ! points per friend
   - Let's substitute the following:
   - Total ! points earned = 13.75
   - Average number of ! points per friend = 1
   - Total ! points earned / Average number of ! points per friend = Total number of friends
 
   - Therefore:
   - Total number of friends = 13.75 ! points earned / Average number of ! points per friend
   - Total number of friends = 13.75 ! points earned / 1 ! point per friend
   - Simplification: Total number of friends = 13.75 × 1

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use system of equations to find the unknown variables, and then calculate the total cost.

Let x be the number of tickets that Haley bought for her friends. Then the total number of tickets bought by Haley is:
3 (for herself) + x (for her friends) = T (total number of tickets)

Let y be the number of extra tickets. Then:
5 = y (in case her friends wanted to go)

We know that each ticket costs $4. Dollars, so the cost for each ticket is:
4 dollars per ticket

Haley spent:
3 (for herself) * $4 = $12 on tickets for herself
x (for her friends) * $4 = x dollars on tickets for her friends
5 (extra) * $4 = $20 on extra tickets

So the total amount spent by Haley on tickets is:
T = $12 + x + $20 = $32 + x dollars (where T is the total number of tickets)

We can also find the total number of tickets as:
T = 3 (for herself) + x (for her friends) + 5 (for extras) = 3 + x + 5 = 8 tickets (in total)

Now let's find y, the number of extra tickets that she bought. She wants to make sure that there are 5 tickets in case her friends want to go. Let's assume that her friends each bought n tickets. Then:
n * 3 (for friends) + 5 (for extras) = 5 (in total)
n * 3 = 0 (since we are assuming that her friends didn't buy any tickets)
Since n is the number of tickets bought by each of her friends, this is impossible (her friends can't buy negative or zero number of tickets).

This means that either no one other than Haley is going to the concert or her friends are all coming. 

Let's assume that no one other than Haley is going to the concert. That means we don't need to buy any extra tickets, so y is 0.

So, in summary, we know T, the number of tickets. Since we already know that T is the total number of tickets,

T = 3 + x = 8 (in total)

Now let's calculate the total amount spent by Haley on tickets and the concert fees:

Haley's spent on tickets is:
T * $4 = $32 + x dollars

There's another $1 fee per ticket for the concert, so:
(3 + x) * $5 = $15 on concert fees

In total, Haley spent:
Ticket and concert fees = $32 + x + $15 = $47 + x dollars

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. George had 30 dollars:Let x be the total amount of money George has now. We can write the equation for this as:

x - 30 = 0

2. For his birthday, George got 16 dollars more:Let y represent the amount of money George received as a gift for his birthday. Therefore, the amount of money George had after receiving his gift but before spending it on the game is:

(x - 30) + 16 = y

3. Spent 38 dollars on a new game:Let z represent the amount George spent on the new game. Thus, the total amount George has spent so far is:

y - z = 30 (George had 30 dollars before any birthday gift or game purchases)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate y:

x - 30 = (x - 30) + 16 - z

Simplify:

x = 16 + z

4. Connecting our expressions for y and z:

(x - 30) + 16 - z = 0

Substitute the expression for z from step 3:

x - 30 = 16 - (16 + z)

Simplify:

x = -z

This isn't a meaningful expression for x, but it tells us that x and z have opposite signs. Since we know that George can't possibly have a negative amount of money, the answer is invalid. This implies that x or z cannot be negative. 

Either George didn't spend all of the money he received as a gift on the game, which means that:

z < (y - 38)

or George still has the game that he bought for 38 dollars, which means that:

z > 38

This is a contradiction since either z is too small or too big to represent what George spent on the game. Therefore, we should check other possible scenarios that fit all the pieces together:

(Scenario 1)

George spent less than 38 dollars on the game. Let z be the actual amount of money George spent on the game. We can modify the third equation and substitute it into step 3:

y - z = 30

Substitute this into step 2:

x = y + 16

Substitute y from step 1:

x = 30 + 16 + 16 - z

Finally, we can combine the equations to minimize the number of variables:

x = 62 - z

(Scenario 2)

George still has the game that he bought for 38 dollars. Let z be the price of the new game George bought.

z > 38

We can modify the third equation, and we have:

y = 30 + z - 38

Substitute this into step 2:

x = y + 16

Simplify:

x = 16 + z - 38

Finally, we can combine the equations to minimize the number of variables:

x = 52 - z

(Scenario 3)

George received less than 16 dollars as a gift, and he still has the game that he bought for 38 dollars. Let y be the actual amount of money he received as a gift, and let z be the price of the new game he bought.

y < 16

We can substitute y into step 2:

x = (x - 30) + y + 16 - z

Substitute z from step 4:

x = y + 38

Simplify:

x = 38 + y

Finally, we can combine the equations to minimize the number of variables:

x = 38 + y

The final answers for x, depending on the scenario, are:

1. x = 62 - z
2. x = 52 - z

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of systematic variation. This means we can set up a formula that systematically varies as certain inputs vary. In this case, we know that each cage has a certain number of parrots and parakeets based on the input of the number of cages (n). 

Let's start by defining our formula for the number of parrots in each cage where n is the number of cages:

Number of parrots per cage = n * 8

Next, we'll set up a similar formula for the number of parakeets in each cage:

Number of parakeets per cage = n * 2

Now, we'll sum the total number of parrots and parakeets in all of the cages to find the total number of birds:

Total number of birds = (n * 8) * number of cages + (n * 2) * number of cages

Simplifying this formula, we get:

Total number of birds = n * (8 * number of cages + 2 * number of cages)

Let's substitute our values for n, which we know is 4 in this problem.

Total number of birds = 4 * (8 * 4 + 2 * 4)

We can expand this equation in our heads to solve for the total number of birds:

Total number of birds = 4 * 32

Total number of birds = 128

With our final answer in sight, let's wrap it up!

{The final answer is} 128

Therefore, the pet store has a total of 128 birds spread across its four bird cages.</s>",40,40.0,128.0

<|assistant|>
Let's break this down into smaller steps to make it easier to follow:

1. Kaleb bought 14 boxes of chocolate/candy.
2. He gave 5 boxes to his little brother.
3. Each box contains 6 pieces of candy or chocolate.
4. How many pieces does Kaleb still have left?

To find out how many pieces Kaleb still has left, we need to calculate how many pieces were in the boxes he didn't give to his brother and then subtract the pieces from the boxes he did give to his brother.

5. There were initially 14 boxes, and each box contained 6 pieces. So, the total number of pieces in all the boxes when Kaleb bought them was 14 * 6 = 84.
6. Kaleb gave 5 boxes to his brother, but we don't yet know how many pieces were in those 5 boxes. Let's call that number x.
7. The total number of pieces in the boxes that Kaleb didn't give to his brother is 14 * 6 - x.
8. We've already calculated how many pieces were originally in all the boxes, so we can set that equal to the number of pieces from the boxes Kaleb didn't give to his brother plus the number of pieces in the 5 boxes he did give to his brother.
   9. 84 = (14 * 6 - x) + x * 6
10. Simplifying this equation, we get:
      x = 24
11. So, Kaleb gave 5 boxes, each with 24 pieces, for a total of 120 pieces.
12. The total number of pieces Kaleb still has is the number of pieces in the 9 boxes he kept (9 * 6) minus the 120 pieces he gave away.
13. Let's call that number y. Using our previous calculations, we find that y is equal to:
      9 * 6 - 120
14. Simplifying this equation, we get:
      y = 18
15. Therefore, Kaleb still has 18 pieces left from the boxes he didn't give to his brother.

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of pictures Robin had in total as n.

We know that Robin uploaded a total of 36 pictures (31 from her phone and 5 from her camera) to Facebook.

Let's let x be the number of pictures in each album. Since Robin sorted the pictures into 9 different albums with the same amount of pictures in each album, we can set up the equation:

36 = 9x

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:

4 = x

So, each album has 4 pictures.

{The final answer is 4 pictures per album.}

Now we know how many pictures are in each album, we can find out how many pictures Robin has left over after she has uploaded them to Facebook.

The total number of pictures she has left is n - (31 from her phone + 5 from her camera), which is n - 36.

This can be written as:

n = (31 from her phone + 5 from her camera) + (4 times the number of albums)

Substituting our previous calculations for the number of pictures per album and the total number of pictures Robin uploaded to Facebook, we get:

n = (31 + 5) + (4 times 9)

Expanding the equation:

n = 36 + 36

So, the total number of pictures Robin has is 72.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's translate the symbols into words to understand the problem better:

Mike earned $69 dollars mowing lawns over a certain summer.
Let's call this summer x.
If Mike earned more money mowing lawns during summer x than during the previous summer (the ""?"" summer), we'll represent this as "">"" (meaning ""greater than"").
If Mike earned less money mowing lawns during summer x than during the ""?"" summer, we'll represent this as ""<"" (meaning ""less than"").
If Mike earned the same amount of money mowing lawns during summer x as during the ""?"" summer, we'll represent this as ""="" (meaning ""equal to"").
Mike spent $24 dollars on new mower blades during summer x.
Let's call the number of 5-dollar games Mike could buy with the money he had left after buying mower blades during summer x as y.

To solve this problem, we need to find y.
Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to determine the relationship between the summers labeled ""?"" and x.
We don't have enough information yet to know whether Mike made more or less money during summer x than during the ""?"" summer, so let's assume for now that there's no relationship between the two summers.
If it turns out that we can rule out certain scenarios based on the given information, we'll revise our assumptions.

2. Next, let's find out how much money Mike made mowing lawns during summer x.
Mike earned $69 dollars mowing lawns during summer x, which we represent as:
69 = M (meaning Mike's earnings from mowing lawns during summer x)

3. Let's try to find out how much money Mike made during the ""?"" summer, so we can compare it to his earnings during summer x.
Again, we don't have enough information yet to know whether Mike made more or less money during summer x than during the ""?"" summer, so we'll assume for now that his earnings were the same:
M = ?

4. Now, let's find out how much money Mike spent on mower blades during summer x. Based on the information given, we know that this amount is $24, which we represent as:
24 = B (meaning Mike's expenses on buying mower blades during summer x)

5. Now we know how much money Mike earned during summer x (M) and how much money he spent during summer x (B).
The difference between these amounts gives us how much money Mike had left after buying mower blades during summer x.
Let's represent this as L, for ""leftover"" money:
L = M - B

6. Finally, let's find out how many 5-dollar games Mike could buy with the money he had left.
If we let y be the number of 5-dollar games Mike could buy with the money he had left, and assume that each game costs exactly $5, we can represent this as:
y = L / 5 (meaning Mike could buy y games with the remainder of his money after considering the costs of other expenses)

7. Now let's put all of our equations together to create a system of linear equations that represents all of the information given.

M = ?
24 = B
L = M - B
y = L / 5

8. Let's solve this system of equations to find the value of y (the number of 5-dollar games Mike could buy with the money he had left).
To do so, we'll use the MATLAB function solve.
To implement this, first, clear the workspace and close any open figures using clc and close all.
Next, create a system using four equal sign signs to connect the variable names to corresponding expressions, separated by semicolons:
A = [M==?, 24==B, L==M-B, y==L/5];
And then use solve to find values that simultaneously satisfy all four equations.
The variable values will be returned in a cell array.
We're interested in the part of the variable values related to y, so we'll extract this part:
y_values = subs(solution(A),{'?','M','L','B'},{'>','69 - 24','M','L - 24','B'});

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first calculate the cost of each new piece of furniture. Let the cost of a new chair be x and the cost of a new table be y. Then, 

2 chairs cost 2x and 2 tables cost 2y. So, the total cost of the furniture is 

2x + 2y + 2x + 2y = 4x + 4y

Since Maria spent a total of $! on the furniture, we have 

4x + 4y = !

Next, we calculate the time it takes Maria to put together one piece of furniture. Since she spent 8 minutes on each piece, we have 

1 piece = 8 minutes

Let the time it takes Maria to put together one chair be c, and the time it takes to put together one table be d. Then, 

c chairs take c * 2 = 2c minutes and d tables take d * 2 = 2d minutes. The total time it takes Maria to put together all of the furniture is 

2c + 2d = 8 * (2 + 2) = 64 minutes

Since we know how long it takes Maria to put together all of the furniture, we can find out how long it takes her to finish the entire task. Let the time it takes Maria to finish be t. Then, 

c chairs, d tables, and the finishing touch take t minutes in total. So, we have 

2c + 2d + t = 64

Now, let's substitute the values for c and d that we calculated earlier. We have 

2 * 8 + 2 * d + t = 64

Solving for t, we get 

t = 64 - 32 = 32 minutes

Therefore, it took Maria 32 minutes to finish putting together all of the furniture. {The final answer is: 32 minutes}.</s>",32,32.0,32.0

<|assistant|>
1. Rachel took a total of 6 pictures at the zoo and 9 pictures at the museum.
2. Let's call the total number of pictures Rachel had after deleting some of them as ""x"".
3. We know that Rachel originally took a total of 6 pictures at the zoo. After deleting some of these pictures, the number of pictures remaining from the zoo is also included in x. Therefore, x must be greater than or equal to 6.
4. Similarly, Rachel originally took a total of 9 pictures at the museum. After deleting some of these pictures, the number of pictures remaining from the museum is also included in x. Therefore, x must be greater than or equal to 9.
5. We are given that Rachel deleted a total of 11 pictures. Let's say out of these, c pictures were from the zoo and the remaining (11-c) pictures were from the museum.
6. Now, the total number of pictures Rachel took at the zoo after deleting some of them is 6-c. Similarly, the total number of pictures Rachel took at the museum after deleting some of them is 9-(11-c) which equals to 9-11+c as we want the number of pictures remaining after deletion.
7. From step 2, the total number of pictures Rachel has is x. Comparing this with step 6, we can find that x must be equal to 6-c + 9-11+c.
8. Solving the equation 6-c + 9-11+c = x, we get that x is equivalent to 15 - 2c. As we know that the total number of pictures Rachel has is greater than or equal to 6 (from step 3) and greater than or equal to 9 (from step 4), let's say x is greater than or equal to 9. Plugging this into our equation, we get that 15 - 2c is greater than or equal to 9. Simplifying, we get that c is less than or equal to 4. Thus, the number of pictures Rachel deleted from the zoo cannot be greater than 4.
9. Using the new constraint that c is less than or equal to 4, let's assume that Rachel deleted 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 pictures from the zoo. In case Rachel deleted 0 pictures from the zoo, c would be zero and the number of pictures Rachel still has is (6) + (9-11) = 2. In case Rachel deleted 1 picture from the zoo, c would be 1 and the number of pictures Rachel still has is (5) + (9-10) = 4. Similarly, we can calculate Rachel's remaining pictures for c = 2, 3, and 4 for which c is less than or equal to 4 and x remains greater than or equal to 9.
10. It can be verified that the most number of pictures Rachel can be left with is 23 (when c = 0). This occurs when Rachel deletes no pictures from the zoo and 11 pictures from the museum (c = 11, x = 23).

In summary, the final answer is that when Rachel deleted a total of 11 pictures, she could still have a minimum of 9 and a maximum of 23 pictures from her vacation (after deletion).</s>",4,4.0,23.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps. Let's start by finding the total number of cookies Maria has.

1. First, we know that Maria has both chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies. The number of chocolate chip cookies she has is ! 5, and the number of oatmeal cookies she has is 19. Let's represent this as x and y, respectively.

    x = ! 5
    y = 19

2. Next, we want to find out how many cookies are in each baggy. Maria is making baggies containing 8 cookies. Let's represent this as b.

    b = 8

3. Now, we can use this information to find out how many chocolate chip cookies are in each baggy. We know that each baggy contains 8 cookies, and that there are x chocolate chip cookies in total. We can use division to find out how many chocolate chip cookies are in each baggy.

    number of chocolate chip cookies in each baggy = x ÷ 8

4. We can do the same for the oatmeal cookies. Since we know that there are y oatmeal cookies in total, we can use division to find out how many oatmeal cookies are in each baggy.

    number of oatmeal cookies in each baggy = y ÷ 8

5. In order to find out how many baggies Maria can make in total, we need to know how many cookies are in total. We already know that Maria has a total of x chocolate chip cookies and y oatmeal cookies. Let's find out how many of each type of cookie she has left over after filling the baggies.

    number of chocolate chip cookies left over = x - (x ÷ 8) * b
    number of oatmeal cookies left over = y - (y ÷ 8) * b

6. Now that we know how many cookies are left over, we can find out how many baggies Maria can make. Each baggy contains 8 cookies, so we can use division again to find out how many baggies Maria can make with the number of cookies she has left over.

    number of baggies Maria can make = ((x - (x ÷ 8) * b) + (y - (y ÷ 8) * b)) ÷ 8

7. Finally, we can bring all of our calculations together to find out how many baggies Maria can make in total.

    number of baggies Maria can make = (b * (x ÷ 8)) + (b * (y ÷ 8)) + ((x - (x ÷ 8) * b) + (y - (y ÷ 8) * b)) ÷ 8

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps and identify the unknowns.

First, we'll analyze each part of the question:

- There's a sale, but it's not defined exactly. We'll call it X%. We also know there's an exclamation point after ""sale,"" indicating that it's an important part of the problem.
- The question mentions a discount. Initially, we're not sure if this is related to the sale. We'll call the discount Y%.
- We're given the price of a single flower: $3.
- Zoe bought a certain number of roses and daisies: R and D, respectively.
- We're specifically asked how much Zoe spent. Let's call this S.

We'll identify the unknowns in this scenario:
- X%: Sale percentage, which we've designated as X.
- Y%: Discount percentage, also designated as Y.
- R: Number of roses that Zoe bought.
- D: Number of daisies that Zoe bought.
- S: Total amount that Zoe spent.

Now that we know the unknowns, let's create an equation that incorporates all these variables.

The price of a single flower at the sale is $3(1-X\%/100)$, since everything is discounted, except we don't know whether the discount is applied to the flowers or the sale.

Let's say Zoe bought R roses at the discounted price, so the total price of the roses is $R(3(1-X\%/100)$.

Similarly, let's say she bought D daisies at the sale price, then the total price of the daisies is $D(3(1-X\%/100))$.

Now, it's unclear whether the discount and sale should be applied separately or simultaneously, but let's assume Zoe gets the full benefit of the sale before applying the discount. This means that the price of a single rose would be $3-Y$ (base price of a rose), and the price of a single daisy would be $3(1-Y\%/100)$ (discounted daisy price). Taking this information into consideration, the total price of the roses would be $R(3-Y)$ and the total price of the daisies would be $D[3(1-X\%/100)]$.

Adding together the price of the roses and the price of the daisies would give us the total amount that Zoe spent:

$R(3-Y)+D[3(1-X\%/100)]=S$

Now, let's bring in the given information:

$R=8 \ \ D=2 \ \ S=?$

We have three unknowns (X, Y, S) and three equations (the three previously-mentioned equations) that contain these unknowns. We'll manipulate the equations and use them to find the values of X, Y, and S.

Let's start with the equation for Rose's price:

$3-Y=$ A constant price for a rose, so let's call it R'

This price is discounted (by Y %), as shown below:

$R' (1-Y\%/100) = 3(1-X\%/100) − Y \ %$ (equivalent to the equation we used at the beginning)

At the flower store, every flower is discounted by Y% and by X%. Let's say the full price of a flower (before any discounts) is P. We'll find P based on the prices of one single rose and one single daisy.

$3(1-X\%/100)−Y = 3(1-X\%/100)-Y$

$P = R' + D' = 3(1-X\%/100)−Y + 3(1-X\%/100) = 6$

Using the prices for R' and D' we can find an expression for X in terms of Y:

$X \% = \frac{P-R'-D'}{R'-D'-P}$

Now, let's substitute R', D', and P from the previous equation:",30,30.0,6.0

To solve this problem, let's first identify the variables:

- B: number of books
- F: number of fiction (regular) bookcases
- M: number of fiction (mystery) bookcases
- P: number of picture bookcases

Now, let's follow each step of the reasoning:

1. Each fiction (regular) bookcase has exactly 8 books. Let's call the number of books on a single fiction (regular) bookcase F8. Each fiction (mystery) bookcase also has exactly 8 books. Let's call the number of books on a single fiction (mystery) bookcase M8.

2. She has 5 bookcases filled with fiction (regular) books and 4 bookcases filled with mystery books. Let's call the total number of fiction (regular) bookcases F and the total number of fiction (mystery) bookcases M.

3. We can find the number of books on the fiction (regular) bookcases by multiplying the number of fiction (regular) bookcases (F) by the number of books on a single fiction (regular) bookcase (F8).

4. We can find the number of books on the fiction (mystery) bookcases by multiplying the number of fiction (mystery) bookcases (M) by the number of books on a single fiction (mystery) bookcase (M8).

5. We can find the number of books on picture bookcases by multiplying the number of picture bookcases (P) by the number of books in each picture bookcase. Let's call this number Pn.

6. Now that we know the number of books on the different bookcases, we sum up all the bookcases: B = F * F8 + M * M8 + P * Pn.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use algebra to represent the number of pages used by John as an unknown variable, let's call it x. We can then set up an equation based on the information given in the question.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John collects baseball cards and organizes them in a binder with three pages on each side (a binder with 3 on). This means that each page in the binder can hold nine cards (3 x 3).

2. John starts with a total of 16 old cards in the binder. This means that he has initially used x - 16 pages in the binder (before adding the new cards).

3. John adds 8 new cards to the binder. Since each page can hold nine cards, the new cards will require one additional page, beyond the x - 16 pages used for the old cards.

4. Since the binder has exactly 128 pages (i.e., (3 x 3) x 32 pages), we can set up an equation that describes the number of pages currently used by John in the binder:

(x - 16) pages for the old cards, plus 1 page for the new cards, gives:

x - 16 + (8 + 1) = 128

5. Simplifying the above expression, we get:

x = 144

Therefore, the final number of pages (the answer to the question) is:

{The final answer is} 144 pages.

Note: We can also use a system of equations to represent this scenario, especially when the relationship between the variables is more complex. However, since John's number of old cards is constant for the entire scenario, we didn't need to use a system of equations here.</s>",8,8.0,144.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this word problem, we can use a step-by-step approach and treat the statement as a system of equations. Here's how:

Step 1: Understand the problem
In this problem, we have several statements that provide us with information. Let's write them down and analyze what they mean:
- Isabel wants to bake brownies for her party.
- Isabel already baked 3 brownies.
- Isabel needs a total of 5 brownies for her party.
- Each brownie requires 5 cups of flour.

Step 2: Simplify and rearrange the given information
Let's analyze these statements and simplify the given information:
- Let's call the number of brownies Isabel wants to bake ""x"".
- She already baked 3 of them, so we can say she has already baked 3 brownies.
- We want to find out how many brownies ""x"" is, so that in the end we will have a total of 5.

- Each brownie requires 5 cups of flour. Let's call the number of cups of flour she used for each brownie ""z"".
- We already know that for each brownie she uses 5 cups of flour. We are still trying to find out how many cups of flour (in total) she uses for ""x"" brownies, so we'll represent the total number of cups of flour required for all of them by ""xz"".

Step 3: Create a system of equations
Now we have enough information to create a system of equations:

- Already baked 3 brownies: x(Brownies) = 3
- Each brownie requires 5 cups of flour: z(Cups) = 5
- Total brownies required: 5 brownies = 5
- Total number of cups required: x(Brownies) * z(Cups) = xz (cups)

Let's write them as a system of equations:

x + 3 = 5	(1)
z = 5	(2)
xz = x * z = ?	(3)

Step 4: Solve the system of equations
We already know the value of ""z"" from step 2. Now we have a system of two equations with two variables: ""x"" and ""z"". Let's use the technique called ""substitution"" to solve for ""x"" and then find out the final number of remaining cups she needs for her party.

We start by applying the known value of ""z"" in Eqn(1):

x + 3 = 5	(1)
z = 5	(2)

xz = x * z = ?	(3)

When we substitute ""z = 5"" into Eqn(1), we get

x + 3 = 5	(1)

Let's rearrange this equation to find the value of ""x"". Note that when we subtract ""3"" from both sides, the value of ""x"" gets isolated from other calculations.

x = 5 - 3	(4)

Thus, ""x"" is the remaining number of brownies required, and she still needs ""x"" cups of flour to finish her baking.

Step 5: Find out the required number of remaining cups of flour
To find out the total number of remaining cups she still needs, we need to isolate ""xz"" in Eqn(3) by substituting the value of ""x"" and ""z"" found in Eqn(4) and (2).

xz = x * z	(3)

Replace ""x"" with ""5 - 3"" and ""z"" with ""5"" in Eqn(3).

(5 - 3) * 5 = ? (3)

Doing the multiplication in step 5 and simplifying:

2 * 5 = 10 cups of flour she still needs.

Final Answer:
Therefore, after baking 3 brownies Isabel still requires 10 more cups of flour (in addition to the 15 she already used) to finish her baking for the party. So, in total she needs 25 cups of flour (5*5).

{The final answer is: Isabel still requires 10 more cups of flour to finish her baking for the party, which means she needs a total of 25 cups of flour in total (5*5",10,10.0,5.0

<|assistant|>
1. Initially, Maria made 19 cupcakes. (Given)

2. She sold 15 of them. (Given)

3. After selling 15 cupcakes, Maria made 10 more cupcakes, bringing her total number of cupcakes to (15 + 10) = 25.

4. Therefore, the number of cupcakes Maria has currently is 25. (Step 3 results in the current number of cupcakes)

5. We can find the number of cupcakes Maria made in total by adding the initial number of cupcakes she made (19) to the ones she made after selling 15 (10), giving us a total of (19 + 10) = 29 cupcakes made in total.

6. To find the unknown quantity (?, the number of cupcakes Maria makes after selling the remaining 5), we can compare the known quantity (the number of cupcakes Maria has now: 25) to the unknown quantity (before Maria sells the remaining 5).

7. At this point in time, there is no additional information about the time frame, so it's safe to assume these events happened in succession. Since Maria made 10 more cupcakes after selling the first 15, we know she makes cupcakes at a consistent rate.  The total number of cupcakes she has now (25) is less than, but quite close to, the number of cupcakes she made in total (29), implying that she hasn't made too many cupcakes recently. Therefore, the discrepancy between the number of cupcakes Maria has now and the number she made in total is likely to be a small amount, and we can assume this holds true for the remaining 5.

8. If we assume that Maria continues to make cupcakes at a constant rate and sells the remaining 5 cupcakes, we can find the number of cupcakes she makes after selling those by repeating step 3 and adding that to the current cupcake count.

9. After selling the remaining 5 cupcakes, we can estimate that Maria makes approximately 10 more cupcakes.

10. This means that after selling the remaining 5 cupcakes, we can expect Maria's cupcake count to be (current cupcake count + unknown quantity - old unknown) = (25 + 10 - 5) = 30 cupcakes.

11. Therefore, the total number of cupcakes Maria would have made after selling the remaining 5 cupcakes is (initial cupcake count + initial cupcake count after selling the first 15 + unknown quantity made after selling the remaining 5), which equals (19 + 25 + 10) = 44 cupcakes after selling the remaining 5.

12. We can calculate the unknown quantity using the steps above to find the total number of cupcakes Maria made after selling the remaining 5.

13. After substituting for the values we've calculated in step 5 and 11, this equation looks as follows:

Total cupcakes made after selling the remaining 5 = Initial cupcake count + Initial cupcake count after selling the first 15 + Unknown quantity made after selling the remaining 5

14. The given information is Total cupcakes made after selling the remaining 5 = 44.

15. Using step 13 to find the unknown value:

19 + (19 + 10) - 5 + Unknown quantity = 44

16. Now we can find the unknown quantity using algebra:

Unknown quantity = 44 - (19 + 15)

17. Evaluating:

Unknown quantity = 44 - 34

18. Finally, the unknown quantity is 10 cupcakes.

19. In conclusion: Maria initially made 19 cupcakes, sold 15, made 10 more, sold the remaining 5, and made 10 more at a consistent rate for a total of 44 cupcakes.

The final answer is 10 cupcakes.</s>",24,24.0,10.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many tickets Tom bought in total. We can rewrite the first equation using multiplication and division, which makes it easier to compare with the second equation:

Tom bought 40 : tickets at the state fair.
To find out the number of tickets, we solve the equation for x:

40 = tickets
To find out how many tickets Tom bought, we multiple both sides by tickets:

tickets * tickets = 40 * tickets
We can simplify the left side by using the distributive property:

tickets^2 = 40 * tickets
Then, we divide both sides by tickets to get:

tickets = 40 / 1 = 40 tickets

2. Now that we know how many tickets Tom bought at the state fair, we can find out how many tickets he bought at the dunk and clown booths. First, we know that Tom spent 28 dollars at the dunk booth:

28 dollars = ? tickets
To find out how many tickets Tom spent, we divide both sides by 25 cents:

28 dollars = ? tickets / 25 cents
We convert 25 cents to a decimal by dividing by 100:

28 dollars = ? tickets / 0.25
Next, we can use the distributive property again to remove the decimal place:

28 dollars = ? * 100 tickets / 0.25
Then, we can use algebra to solve for x:

2800 dollars = ? * 400 tickets
We get:

? = 70 tickets

At the clown booth, we do the same thing:

Tom ! used . The rest ! on rides.
We remove the words and symbols that are not important for our calculation:

Tom unused . The rest . On rides.
To simplify this, we can replace the unused and rest with a variable, x. And replace the symbol ! with the word ""did not"":

Tom did not use x tickets at the clown booth.
Next, we know that there are some tickets leftover (we assume they didn't use all the tickets they bought):

Some leftover tickets = x tickets
We can simplify this by subtracting x from both sides:

Leaftover tickets = some leftover tickets - x tickets
Then we can find out how many tickets tom bought at the clown booth:

Leaftover tickets - x tickets = 70 - x tickets
To simplify this algebraically, we can solve for x:

Leaftover tickets - x tickets = 70 - x tickets
We move the variable to one side:

x tickets - x tickets = 70 - leaftover tickets
Next, we subtract x tickets from both sides:

(x - x) tickets = 70 - leaftover tickets
Finally, we can use the property of an expression equals zero to find out how many tickets are remaining:

0 = 70 - leaftover tickets
Now, we can find out how many rides Tom could go on using the information that we have:

Each ride costs 4 tickets.
Tom spent x dollars on the tickets, so:

x dollars = 4 * x rides
Or, we can solve for x rides using algebra:

x dollars = 4 * x rides
We divide both sides by 4:

x dollars / 4 = x rides
We convert dollars to cents and simplify:

x * 100 = 4 * x rides
We divide by 4:

(x * 100) / 4 = x rides
Finally, we put all the answers together:

Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair.
At the dunk booth, Tom spent 70 tickets.
Tom did not use x tickets at the clown booth, leaving some tickets leftover.
These tickets and the remaining ones from the state fair and the dunk booth add up to x.
After riding on x rides, Tom still has some leftover tickets.
The final cost for the tickets is x dollars, and each ride cost 4 tickets.

{The final answer is: Tom could go on x rides, where x is the solution to the system of equations:

3. In addition to the students who left, 11 new students came to school. Let's call this number of new students, N.

4. At the end of the year, we want to find out how many students were in fourth grade. Let's call this final number of students, NF.

5. We can set up an equation to help us find NF. We know that initially there were N1 students, and by the end there were NF students, taking into account the students who left and the new students:

   N1 - L + N = NF

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations using the given information. Let x be the number of green towels Maria has left and y be the number of white towels Maria has left.

The number of green towels Maria bought is 35, and the number of green towels she gave her mother is 34. This means the number of green towels she has left is:

x = 35 - 34
x = 1

Maria also bought 21 white towels, and she gave her mother some of them. Let's say she gave away b white towels. Then, the number of white towels she has left is:

y = 21 - b

We can set up the system of linear equations:

1. 35 - x = 34 (number of green towels Maria gave away equals number of green towels she had initially less the number she has left)
2. y = 21 - b (number of white towels Maria has left equals number of white towels she bought less the number she gave away)

To solve this system, we can use either graphical or algebraic methods. Here, we'll use algebraic methods:

1. Solve equation 1 for x:
x = 35 - 34
x = 1

2. Substitute this value of x into equation 2:
y = 21 - b
y = 21 - (34 - 1)
y = -1 - b

3. The variable b represents the number of white towels Maria gave away, which must be a non-negative integer. To find a value for b that satisfies this condition, we can set y to be a non-negative integer.

4. Since y must be a non-negative integer, the value of b must be chosen so that -1 - b is also non-negative. This means:
b >= -1

5. With this restriction on b, let's find a possible value for b. For example, if Maria gave away 10 white towels, then b = 10, and:

y = -1 - 10
y = -11

6. This is not a possible solution since y (number of white towels Maria has left) cannot be a negative integer. Therefore, we need to choose a smaller value for b.

7. Let's try b = 5. Then:

y = -1 - 5
y = -6

8. This is not a possible solution either, since y (number of white towels Maria has left) cannot be a negative integer. Therefore, we need to choose a smaller value for b.

9. After trying several values for b, we can see that we cannot choose b to be a non-negative integer and satisfy the restriction that y is a non-negative integer. Therefore, we have overestimated the value of b, and we cannot find a solution that satisfies the given conditions.

10. Therefore, the system of linear equations does not represent a unique solution. It means that the information given in the original problem is not enough to determine the exact number of towels Maria has left.

The final answer is: {The system of linear equations does not represent a unique solution}.

Therefore, without further information, we cannot know how many towels Maria ended up with.</s>",22,22.0,10.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's first understand the given information. Adam was playing a trivia game, which had two halves. In the first half, he answered 8 out of the total questions. In the second half, he answered 2 out of the total questions. Each correct answer in the second half was worth 8 points, which is why every question in the second half was worth 8 points as well.

We can represent this information using variables as follows:

- The total number of questions in the first half was x.
- The total number of questions in the second half was y.
- Each question in the first half was worth 1 point.
- In the first half, Adam answered 8 out of x questions correctly.
- In the second half, Adam answered 8 questions, and he answered 2 out of those 8 questions correctly.

Let's calculate the scores for both halves separately:

In the first half:

- The total number of points Adam earned in the first half was 1 point for each of the 8 questions he answered correctly. (8 * 1)
- So, the score for the first half was (8 * 1) = 8.

In the second half:

- Adam answered 8 questions.
- Each correct answer earned him 8 points. (8 * 8)
- Each incorrect answer did not earn him any points.
- So, the score for the second half was (8 * 8) = 64.

Now that we have the scores for each half, let's determine the total number of questions (x + y) in the entire game:

- In the first half, Adam answered 8 out of x questions.
- So, we can find x using the formula: 8 = (x/10) * 100
- Where 100 is the total number of questions in the first half.
- This gives us: x = (8/0.8) * 100 = 100
- So, the total number of questions in the first half was 100.
- To find the total number of questions, add the number of questions in the first half to the number of questions in the second half: Total number of questions = 100 + y

Let's determine the value of y by solving this equation for y:

- Adam answered 2 out of 8 questions in the second half.
- So, we can find y using the formula: 2 = (y/8) * 100
- Where 100 is the total number of questions in the second half.
- This gives us: y = (2/0.2) * 100 = 100
- So, the total number of questions in the second half was 100 as well.

Now that we know the total number of questions in the entire game is 200, we can deduce Adam's final score:

- In the first half, Adam scored 8 points.
- In the second half, Adam scored 64 points.
- So, Adam's final score was 8 + 64 = 72 points.

To summarize, the final answer is: Adam's final score in the game was 72 points.</s>",80,80.0,72.0

To find the total number of cans collected by Paul, we need to follow these steps:

1. On Saturday, Paul filled 6 bags with 8 cans each. The total number of cans collected on Saturday is:
   Number of bags filled (6) times number of cans in each bag (8) = 48 cans
   {The first step is: The number of cans on Saturday is 48.}

Let's call the unknown number of friends x. We can set up a system of equations to find the value of x:

1. Bianca and x friends were recycling. Let's call the total number of pounds recycled y.
   Bianca recycled q pounds, so Bianca's portion is q of the total y.
   x friends recycled x pounds, so the friends' portion is x of the total y.
   The total number of pounds recycled is y.
   y = q + x

2. For every ! pound recycled, they earned ! point.
   Bianca earned !z points for recycling q pounds.
   Each friend earned !y points for recycling x pounds.
   In total, they earned p points for recycling y pounds.
   p = z · q + y · x

3. Bianca recycled 24 pounds.
   Substitute y = 24 into equation 1:
   x = (24 - q) / 3

4. Substitute the value of y and x into equation 2:
   p = z · q + (24 - q) / 3 · x

   We can now simplify this expression and solve for x.
   Let's call the value of z w.
   Let's call the value of x v.

   p = w · q · (v + 1/3w)

   To find the number of points earned, we need to find the value of p.
   We can leave this as a calculation exercise, or we can assume that we know the value of p and find the values of q, v and w accordingly.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break this down into smaller problems and solve each step:

1. How many chicken wings were there in total after the chef cooked 10 more for the group?

Original number of chicken wings = 8
Number of chicken wings cooked for the group = 10
Total number of chicken wings = Original number of chicken wings + Number of chicken wings cooked for the group
Total number of chicken wings = 8 + 10
Total number of chicken wings = 18

2. How many chicken wings would each friend get if they all got an equal number?

Total number of chicken wings = 18
Number of friends = 3

Chicken wings per friend = Total number of chicken wings / Number of friends
Chicken wings per friend = 18 / 3
Chicken wings per friend = 6

3. How many chicken wings would you expect a friend to have received if they each got an equal number of chicken wings?

Number of chicken wings received by a friend = Chicken wings per friend
Number of chicken wings received by a friend = 6

As we have used all variables in our analysis, our final answer is {The final answer is the number of chicken wings received by a friend, which is 6}.

You could also calculate how many chicken wings were left over after all the friends were served, which would confirm that the answer is correct. However, we do not need to do this as we have already checked that the total number of wings after cooking is equal to the original number plus the number of wings cooked for the group. 

Question: How many chicken wings would each friend get if they all got an equal number?

Answer: Each friend would get 6 chicken wings, as we have calculated above. {The final answer is 6}.</s>",6,6.0,6.0

Step 1: John initially had 33 socks. (John had 33 socks.)
Step 2: John threw away 19 old socks that no longer fit. (John threw away 19 old socks that no longer fit.)
Step 3: After throwing away the old socks, John was left with 33 - 19 = 14 socks in total. (John had 14 socks.)
Step 4: John then purchased 13 new socks. (John bought 13 new socks.)
Step 5: After adding the new socks to his current sock collection, John now has a total of 14 old socks and 13 new socks, for a total of 27 socks. (John now has 27 socks in total.)
Step 6: Therefore, the final number of socks John has is equal to the number from step 5. (The final answer is 27.) 

Alternatively:

Step 1: The initial number of socks John had is represented by 33. (John had 33 socks.)
Step 2: John threw away 19 old socks that did not fit. (John threw away 19 old socks that did not fit.)
Step 3: After discarding the old socks that were no longer useful, John had 33 - 19 = 14 socks left. (John had 14 socks.)
Step 4: John bought a new set of 13 socks. (John bought 13 new socks.)
Step 5: John's updated total number of socks is equal to the sum of the number of old socks remaining and the number of new socks purchased. (John had a total of 14 old socks and 13 new socks, which makes 27 socks altogether.)
Step 6: Hence, John's final number of socks comes out to be 27. (The final answer is 27.)

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. First, we need to find out how many players the coach has in total. The school's baseball team had 2 new players and 6 returning players, so the total number of players is 2 + 6 = 8.
2. Next, we need to find out how many players are in each group. The coach put them into groups with 4 players in each group.
3. Using the information from the previous steps, we can calculate the number of groups. For every group, we need 4 players, and we have 8 total players. So, we divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group:
   Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
   Number of groups = 8 / 4
   Number of groups = 2

<|assistant|>
Let's denote the time needed to paint one room as x hours.

We are given that the painter has already painted 2 rooms. This means that the number of rooms he has left to paint is 6 - 2 = 4 rooms.

The total number of hours the painter has already spent on painting is 2 rooms * 5 hours/room = 10 hours.

We now know that the painter has spent a total of 10 hours on painting the first 2 rooms, and he still needs to paint the remaining 4 rooms. Let's call the total number of hours needed to paint the remaining rooms as y hours.

The total number of hours needed to paint all 6 rooms is the sum of the hours spent on the first 2 rooms and the hours spent on the remaining 4 rooms. Mathematically, this is:

10 hours (for the first 2 rooms) + y hours (for the remaining 4 rooms) = 6 rooms * 5 hours/room

Simplifying this equation:

10 hours + y hours = 30 hours

Let's move the constant 10 to the other side and factor out a y:

y hours = 30 hours - 10 hours (from the time spent on the first 2 rooms)

y hours = 20 hours (the remaining rooms need 20 hours to paint)

So, the painter will take 20 hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms. We can express this as {The final answer is 20 hours} or simply 20 hours.</s>",20,20.0,20.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. The waiter had 22 customers in his section.
2. A certain number of those customers (14) left.
3. The remaining customers (the ! rest) were distributed among the remaining tables.
4. Each of those tables had 4 people at them.

Let's call the original number of tables x.

Before the customers left, we know that the number of customers was equal to the number of tables multiplied by the average number of customers per table:

22 = x * (average number of customers per table)

After some customers left, there were fewer customers, but the remaining customers were still divided among the same number of tables (x), each with an average of 4 people. We can find how many more customers left (y) by comparing the number of customers remaining after some left to the original number of customers:

(Number of customers remaining) = (Number of customers before some left) - (Number of customers who left)

(Number of customers remaining) = (22 - 14)

(Number of customers remaining) = 8

8 = x * (average number of customers per table)

Using the definition of average, we know that average is equal to number of items divided by number of items divided by. For each table, that's:

(average number of customers per table) = (Number of customers per table) / (Number of tables)

(average number of customers per table) = 4 / x

8 = x * (4 / x)

8 = 8 * (1 / x)

x = 1

So, the waiter had 1 table.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, let's find out how many clothes Roger had to wash initially, which is given to us as 120.

2. Roger put 48 pieces of clothing in one load. Let's say this load is of size x. Therefore, we can say that x = 48.

3. Now, Roger decided to split the remaining clothes into 9 equal loads. Let's call the size of each small load as s. Since we are given that they are equal in size, we can find the size of each small load by dividing the remaining clothes with 9 (number of small loads). Using this, we get:

s = (120 - 48) / 9

4. We need to find out how many pieces of clothing go in each small load. Let's say this is y. We can find it by dividing the number of clothes in a small load (s) with the number of clothes in each piece (1) since we assume that all clothes are of the same size. So,

y = s / 1

Now let's solve the expression for y using the expressions we've found out earlier:

y = (120 - 48) / (1 * 9)

Substituting the values of x and y, we get:

y = (120 - 48) / 9

y = (72) / 9

y = 8

5. So, each small load can hold 8 pieces of clothing.

To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of changing quantities in a situation. 

Let's denote the number of students at the end of the year as x. We can reason and write equations as follows:

Originally, there were 10 students in fourth grade at the start of the year.

Number of students at the beginning = 10

During the year, 4 students left the class. Let this number be 'a'.

Number of students left = a

After some time, a total of 42 students joined the class. Let us call this number 'b'.

Number of students joined = b

Applying the concept of changing quantities, we can find the sum of students at the end of the year as:

Total number of students = Original number of students plus the number that joined minus the number that left.

Total number of students = 10 + b - a

Using the information provided, we can write the following equation:

Total number of students in Fourth Grade at the end = 10 + 42 - 4

Simplifying,

x = 48

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break down this problem into smaller steps and solve it one piece at a time:

1. Determine how many books are in the library when Roger arrives.
   - We know there are 14 books to be put away, but we don't know how many are already in the library at the time. Let's represent this unknown number as x.
   - We also know that there is one librarian, which we'll represent as l.
   - Then, we can set up a system of equations to represent these relationships:
     - 14 books (14) = x books (x) + librarian (l)
     - The number of books (x) is greater than or equal to the number of books the librarian (l) is taking away (two). In other words, x >= 2*l.
2. Find out how many books the librarian takes away.
   - Using the information we have, we can reason that the number of books the librarian takes away is two times the number of librarians (l).
   - So, we have an equation for this: 2 * l = y, where y is the number of books the librarian takes away.
3. Determine how many books are left for Roger to put away.
   - After the librarian leaves, the number of books left over is the total number of books (x) less the number of books the librarian took away (y).
   - So, we have an equation for this: x - y = z, where z is the number of books left for Roger to put away.
4. Figure out how many books Roger can fit on a shelf.
   - We're told that Roger can fit three books (3) on a shelf (s).
   - Let's represent the number of shelves Roger will need as s.
   - This can be set up as an equation: z = 3 * s, where we solve for s.
5. Find out how many shelves Roger will need.
   - Substitute our equations from the previous steps into this formula:
   - z = 3 * s
   - x - (2 * l) = 3 * s
   - Then, solve for s:
   - s = (x - 2 * l) / 3
   - Finally, let's represent the number of shelves Roger will need as s.
   - This can be set up as an equation: (x - 2 * l) / 3 = s.

Putting it all together:

- If Roger comes to a library with x books already there and a single librarian (l) picks up two books (y = 2 * l) and leaves, Roger is left with z = x - y = x - 2 * l books to put away.
- Roger can fit 3 books (z) on a shelf (s), so he'll need s shelves to hold all his books.
- For simplicity, let's represent the number of shelves Roger will need as s.
- Then, our final answer is: The number of shelves Roger will need is s = (x - 2 * l) / 3.

Example:
Suppose a library has 54 books (x = 54) and one librarian (l = 1) picks up two-thirds (2/3) of the books. How many shelves will Roger need to hold the remaining books, assuming he can fit three books (z = 3) on each shelf (s)?

First, calculate how many books remain for Roger to put away (z):

- Initially, the library has x = 54 books and librarian makes off with:
- 2/3 of the books = (2/3) * x = y = 36 books
- This leaves a remaining x - y = 18 books (z) for Roger to put away.

Next, determine how many shelves Roger will need (s):

- Each book requires 1 shelf unit (1 shelf per book), so z books (18) requires s shelves.
- To find s, use the formula:
- s = (x - 2 * l) / 3
- s = (54 - 2 * 1) / 3
- s ≈ 11 shelves

So, if Roger comes to this library and encounters the same conditions (x, l, z), he'll need roughly 11 shelves",4,4.0,11.0

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of tulips picked by Bianca as x and the number of roses picked by Bianca as y.

Given information:
- Bianca picked a total of 39 tulips and 49 roses.
- If Bianca had used all the flowers, she would have picked a total of 81 flowers.

Let's translate this into a system of equations:

x + y = 81 (total number of flowers picked)
39 = x (number of tulips picked)
49 = y (number of roses picked)

Now, let's substitute the equation for x into the equation for y to eliminate the variable x:

49 = y

Next, substitute the equation for y into the equation for the total number of flowers picked to find how many extra flowers Bianca picked:

x + 49 = 81

Let's rearrange this equation to isolate x:

x = 81 - 49

Substituting this expression for x into the equation for the number of tulips picked (39 = x) gives us:

39 = 81 - 49

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

39 = 32

This statement is not true, as 32 is not a possible number for Bianca to have picked tulips. Therefore, the initial assumption that Bianca used only 81 of the flowers is not possible, so we need to adjust our calculations.

Let's calculate the number of extra flowers Bianca picked by finding how many more flowers she picked than would have been necessary to make 81 bouquets:

(Actual number of flowers - Number of flowers needed) = Number of extra flowers

(Assume Bianca picked all flowers) - 81 (Number of flowers needed) = Extra flowers

81 = (39 tulips + 49 roses) per bouquet

Number of bouquets = Total number of flowers / (Number of flowers per bouquet) = 81 / (39 + 49)

Let's find the expression for the number of flowers needed:

Number of flowers needed = (Number of bouquets) * (Number of flowers per bouquet) = (81 / (39 + 49)) * (39 + 49) = 81

Since Bianca actually picked 81 flowers, she picked the exact number needed, so there are no extra flowers.

Here's a summary of our findings:

- Bianca picked a total of 39 tulips and 49 roses.
- She picked a total of 81 flowers to make flower bouquets.
- Since she picked the exact number needed, there were no extra flowers.

Final verification: Our answer is true for the system of equations obtained from the original information.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps and reason through each one.

1. How many chairs did Emily buy?
   We are given that Emily bought 4 : new chairs. This is read as ""four to the power of new chairs"". Since ""new"" is not a number, we can simplify this expression by reducing the exponent. 

   - 4² (four squared) = 16 new chairs
   - 4³ (four cubed) = 64 new chairs
   - 4⁰ (four to the power of zero) is undefined, since zero can't be an exponent for a non-zero base.
   
   Since the number of chairs is not explicitly stated, we'll assume Emily bought a finite number, and so the largest possible value of ""new"" is 1 (i.e., we're buying chairs that are new). In this case, we can simplify 4 : new chairs to simply 4 new chairs, which means that Emily bought 4 new chairs.

2. How many tables did Emily buy?
   The number of tables Emily bought is not explicitly stated, but we know that she bought 2 new tables in addition to the chairs. If we let T be the number of tables, then we have:
   - Emily bought 4 new chairs
   - Emily bought 2 new tables (T)
   - In total, Emily bought 4 new chairs and T new tables
   
3. How much did Emily spend on each piece of furniture?
   Again, the cost of each piece of furniture is not explicitly stated, but we are given that Emily spent !8 minutes on each piece of furniture. If W stands for the amount of money Emily spent on each piece of furniture, then:
   - She spent !8 minutes on each piece of furniture, which implies that W/ !8 is the rate at which Emily spends money while assembling each piece of furniture.
   
4. How long did it take for Emily to finish assembling all the furniture?
   To calculate the total time it takes Emily to assemble all the furniture, we need to add up the time taken to assemble all the chairs and tables. Since it took her !8 minutes to assemble each piece of furniture, let X be the total number of chairs and tables assembled, and let us calculate the time required to assemble all the chairs and T new tables:
   - Time for assembling chairs = (number of chairs) * (!8 minutes per chair) = 4 * (!8 minutes) = 720 minutes
   - Time for assembling tables = (number of tables) * (!8 minutes per table) = T * (!8 minutes)
   - Time for assembling all the furniture = time spent assembling chairs + time spent assembling tables = 720 + T * (!8 minutes)
   
5. Find the final answer.
   Now we know how many chairs, how many tables, how much each piece costs, and how long it takes to assemble each piece of furniture. Armed with this knowledge, we can find out how long it took Emily to finish assembling everything:

   - We already know that it took Emily !8 minutes to assemble each piece of furniture
   - We also know that it took her 720 minutes (12 hours) to assemble all the chairs, and we'll use X below to represent the total time it takes her to assemble both the chairs and tables.
   - We're told that she spent !8 minutes on each piece of furniture, which means that she spent (!8) * (W/ !8) dollars on each piece. Since she bought 4 new chairs and T new tables, and each chair cost W dollars and each table cost W dollars, the total cost of all the chairs and tables (C) is:
   - C = 4 * W (for the chairs) + T * W (for the tables)
   
   Now let's put all this together to find X and the final answer:
   - X = time spent assembling all the furniture (including chairs and tables)
   - Time spent assembling the chairs = 720 minutes
   - Time spent assembling the tables = T * (!8 minutes)
   - Total time spent on all the furniture = X = 720 + T * (!8 minutes)
   - And she earns (!8) * (W / !8) dollars per minute worked on assembling, which means that for a total of",48,48.0,8.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the number of short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts washed by Dave before school as x and y, respectively. Then, we can set up two equations to represent the given information:

1. The total number of short sleeve shirts washed before school is x. The number of short sleeve shirts in total is 9. We can set up an equation for this as follows:
   x = 9 (1)

2. The total number of long sleeve shirts washed before school is y. The number of long sleeve shirts in total is 27. We can set up an equation for this as follows:
   y = 27 (2)

Now, let's represent the number of short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts washed by Dave by the time school started as a and b, respectively. Then, the equation for the number of short sleeve shirts washed so far (before school started) is:

x = a (3)

Similarly, we have:

y = b (4)

Combining Equations (1), (3), and (4), we get:

a = 9 (3)

b = 20 (4)

To find the number of shirts that Dave did not wash, we subtract the number of shirts he has already washed from the total number of shirts. Let's represent this as z. Then, the equation for this is:

9 - a = z (5)

Similarly, we have:

27 - b = z (6)

Using Equations (3) and (5), we get:

z = 9 - a

Similarly, using Equations (4) and (6), we have:

z = 27 - b

Using our knowledge of algebra, we can conclude that two equations with two unknowns, x and y, have the same solution. Thus, Equations (5) and (6) are equivalent, and we can equate:

9 - a = 27 - b

Simplifying this further gives us:

-a = -b + 18

As both a and b are positive integers, the minus sign changes the sign of the variables, so we add the magnitude (in this case, 18 in absolute terms) to get the actual value. So, finally, we have:

a = 18 + b (7)

Using Equation (7) and Equation (3), we can easily find the number of short sleeve shirts that Dave did not wash:

z = 9 - (18 + b)

Substituting Equation (4), we have:

z = 9 - (20 - y)

Simplifying this gives us:

z = y - 11

To find the total number of shirts that Dave has not washed, we add up the total number of short sleeve shirts and the long sleeve shirts that he has not washed. Using Equations (7) and (6), we can write:

z = 9 - (18 + b)

z = 27 - b

Let's find both the numbers separately and then add them up:

short sleeve shirts:

z = 9 - (18 + b)

Simplifying this gives us:

z = -b - 9

We know that b is a positive integer, and so is short sleeve shirts. So, let's write:

short sleeve shirts = b + 9 (8)

long sleeve shirts:

z = 27 - b

Simplifying this gives us:

b = 27 - z (9)

Using Equations (8) and (9), we can write:

short sleeve shirts = 27 - z (10)

As we have found the expression for both short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts separately for the remaining shirts that Dave has not yet washed, let's add them up to find the total number of shirts:

z = short sleeve shirts + long sleeve shirts

Using Equations (8) and (10), and simplifying the expression obtained, we get:

z = 36 - z (11)

Now, let's substitute z = -18 in Equation (11) to simplify the expression further",16,16.0,11.0

                     , While on vacation, Haley ; took 50 pictures : at , the ; zoo and ; 8 ; at the museum. If she later deleted . 38 ? of the pictures, , how many pictures , from ! her vacation did she still have? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Step 1: Identify the given information
Haley took 50 pictures during her vacation. She took some at the beach (denoted by b), at the zoo (denoted by z), and at the museum (denoted by m). She later deleted .38 of these pictures. We do not know how many pictures she deleted at each location.

Step 2: Calculate the number of pictures Haley has from the beach
Initially, Haley took an unknown number of pictures at the beach (denoted by x). After deleting .38 of these pictures, she has y (unknown) pictures from the beach.

We know that .38 of the pictures at the beach were deleted, which means that .62 (1 - .38) of the pictures at the beach were not deleted. This is equivalent to saying that 62% of the pictures at the beach were not deleted.

.62 of x is equivalent to y. To solve for y, we can set up an equation as follows:

.62x = y

Step 3: Calculate the number of pictures Haley has from the zoo
Haley took 8 pictures at the zoo (denoted by z). After deleting .38 of these pictures, she has z' (unknown) pictures from the zoo.

Again, we know that .38 of the pictures at the zoo were deleted, which means that .62 of the pictures at the zoo were not deleted. This is equivalent to saying that 62% of the pictures at the zoo were not deleted.

.62z = z'

Step 4: Use the given information to calculate how many pictures Haley originally took at the museum
Initially, Haley took m (unknown) pictures at the museum. After deleting .38 of these pictures, she has m' (unknown) pictures from the museum.

We know that Haley took 50 pictures in total. However, we do not know how many of these pictures were taken at each location. To help us organize the information, let's assign some variable names and use what we know to calculate some unknowns.

50 = x + z + m

Step 5: Solve for m' and m by substituting our calculated values for x, z, and z'
We now have four equations involving unknowns (x, y, z', and m) that we can use to solve for the remaining unknowns. Here's how we'd go about it:

.62x = y
y = .62x

x = (1/.62) * y

Let's substitute this value for x in the next equation:

.38z = z'
z' = .62z

Next, let's substitute the expressions we found for y and z' into our initial equation:

50 = (1/.62) * y + z + (.62) * (.62) * z

We'd want to finish solving this equation for m', but we're interested in how many pictures Haley has left. Let's do one final substitution to find that:

50 - .38y - .62(.62)z = m'

To find the total number of pictures Haley still has, we simply add up the number she has left from each location:

y + z' + m' = {The final answer is}

The final answer is the sum of the number of remaining pictures from each location:

y + z' + m' = (1/.62) * y + .62z + m

By substituting our expressions for y, z', and m into this equation and solving for m, we find that Haley has a total of:

(1/.62) * 0.62y + .62z + m = (1/.62) * (1/.62) * (1 - .38) * 50 + (.62) * (1 - .38) * 8 + m

Note that we've simplified the equations wherever possible by breaking them down into simpler components to make them clearer and easier to follow. Let's substitute the values we've found for y, z, and m into our final equation:

m = (1/.62) * (1/.62) *",20,20.0,62.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of roses the florist had initially by x.

Number of roses initially = x roses
Number of roses sold = 3 roses
Number of roses left = (x - 3) roses

Later, she picked up 34 more roses.

Number of roses after picking up more = (x - 3) + 34 roses

We can find the actual number of roses the florist has at the end by equating both the expressions of the number of roses.

Number of roses after picking up more = Number of roses initially

(x - 3) + 34 = x

We can move 'x' from the right side of the equation to the left side to isolate it.

x - x = -3 - 34 (Subtracting x from both sides)

-31 = -31

Here, the right side is in the form of -31 = -31, which doesn't make any sense, as we cannot have a negative number of roses. This situation is called a contradiction or a logical inconsistency.

So, we have made a mistake in the given scenario, and there seems to be a mistake in the original question. We need to verify the question again.

Let's assume the florist had 50 roses initially.

Number of roses initially = 50 roses
Number of roses sold = 30 roses
Number of roses left = (50 - 30) roses = 20 roses

Later, she picked up 34 more roses.

Number of roses after picking up more = 20 + 34 roses = 54 roses

We can find the actual number of roses the florist has at the end by equating both the expressions of the number of roses.

Number of roses after picking up more = Number of roses initially

54 = 50

We found that 50 and 54 roses are equal, which seems reasonable as we can have a certain number of roses. Here, the final answers of both expressions are the same, and 'The final answer is' is not required to be written here.

The final number of roses the florist has after picking up 34 roses is 54 roses.

In summary, the final number of roses would be 54, assuming the original question had a mistake in it, which should be verified by us first before solving.
In the previous form, where the florist had 5 roses initially, sold 3 and later picked up 34, it was a logical contradiction as we cannot have a negative number of roses.

Therefore, the initial number of roses had to be verified, and we found that making an initial assumption that there were 50 roses that led us to a reasonable answer.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
First, let's find out how many sodas Cody bought in total. Each time Cody bought sodas, he purchased 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas. This means that for Cody's birthday party, we can represent the number of sodas as:

4 regular sodas per pack + 44 diet sodas per pack = total number of sodas per pack

Since Cody bought sodas for his birthday party, let's find out how many packs he bought. Let's call the number of packs x.

4 regular sodas per pack × x packs = 16 regular sodas for the party
44 diet sodas per pack × x packs = 1992 diet sodas for the party

Now that we know how many regular and diet sodas Cody bought, let's find out how many shelves Cody's fridge has the capacity to hold. Let's call the number of shelves y. Since each shelf can hold up to 6 sodas, let's find out how many sodas can fit onto each shelf.

6 sodas per shelf

Now, let's find out how many regular sodas and diet sodas Cody's fridge can hold. Let's represent this as r and d, respectively.

We know that Cody's fridge has the capacity to hold x packs, where each pack contains 16 regular sodas and 1992 diet sodas. When we convert this back to individual sodas, we get:

16 regular sodas per pack × x packs = r regular sodas
1992 diet sodas per pack × x packs = d diet sodas

Now, let's find out how many regular sodas and diet sodas Cody can put onto each shelf of his fridge.

r regular sodas / x packs × 6 sodas per shelf = s number of regular sodas per shelf
d diet sodas / x packs × 6 sodas per shelf = s number of diet sodas per shelf

As an example, let's say Cody can put 60 regular sodas and 750 diet sodas onto each shelf. Now, let's find out how many shelves Cody needs to fill up his fridge.

Let's call the number of shelves Cody needs z. Since each shelf can hold up to 6 sodas, let's find out how many sodas can fit onto each shelf.

6 sodas per shelf

Now, let's find out how many regular sodas and diet sodas fit onto each shelf. Let's represent this as sr and sd, respectively.

60 regular sodas per shelf × z shelves = sr regular sodas
750 diet sodas per shelf × z shelves = sd diet sodas

Since each pack contains 16 regular sodas and 1992 diet sodas, let's find out how many packs fit onto each shelf.

16 regular sodas per pack / 60 regular sodas per shelf = k packs per shelf
1992 diet sodas per pack / 750 diet sodas per shelf = k packs per shelf

Now, let's find out how many regular and diet sodas fit onto each shelf, in terms of packs.

k packs per shelf × 4 regular sodas per pack = kr regular sodas per shelf
k packs per shelf × 44 diet sodas per pack = kd diet sodas per shelf

Now, let's calculate how many packs Cody needs to fill up his fridge. Let's call the number of packs c. Since each pack contains 16 regular sodas and 1992 diet sodas, let's find out how many regular and diet sodas Cody needs to fill up his fridge, in terms of packs.

16 regular sodas per pack × c packs = m regular sodas
1992 diet sodas per pack × c packs = md diet sodas

To calculate how many regular and diet sodas Cody needs to fill up his fridge, we can replace the values of kr, sd, and md with their corresponding formulas.

k regular sodas per shelf = 4 regular sodas per pack / 60 regular sodas per shelf = (4/60)r
kd diet sodas per shelf = 44 diet sod",8,8.0,44.0

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Count the total number of members on the debate team: 26 boys + 46 girls = 72 members

2. Find the number of girls: 46 girls

3. Find the number of boys: 72 members - 46 girls = 26 boys

4. Split the team into ! = 9 groups:

     a. Find the number of girls in each group: 46 girls / 9 groups = 5.11 girls per group (since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to 5 for each group)

     b. Find the number of boys in each group: (72 members - 46 girls) / 9 groups = 10.67 boys per group (rounded down to 10 for each group)

     c. Add the number of girls and boys in each group: 5 girls + 10 boys = 15 members in each group

     d. Calculate the number of groups: ! = number of members / number of members in each group

       ! = 72 members / 15 members per group

       ! = 4.8 groups

       Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll round down to 4 groups they can make.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many apples were ordered for the students who want fruit.

Number of red apples ordered for students who want fruit:
6 red apples per student × 5 students who want fruit = 30 red apples

Number of green apples ordered for students who want fruit:
15 green apples per student × 5 students who want fruit = 75 green apples

Total number of apples ordered for students who want fruit:
30 red apples + 75 green apples = 105 apples

Next, we need to find out how many apples were ordered in total for all students.

Number of red apples ordered in total:
6 red apples per student × total number of students = total number of red apples

Let's say the total number of students is x.
We can substitute this into our equation and solve for x.

x × 6 red apples per student = total number of red apples

Solving for x:
x = total number of red apples ÷ 6 red apples per student

Using this formula, we can find the total number of students, including those who don't want fruit.

Total number of students:
Total number of red apples ÷ 6 red apples per student = x students

Let's say the total number of students is y, and y - 5 represents the number of students who did not want fruit.

Number of apples for students who did not want fruit:
0 red apples per student × (y - 5) students who did not want fruit = 0 red apples
15 green apples per student × (y - 5) students who did not want fruit = 75 green apples

Total number of apples for students who did not want fruit:
0 red apples + 75 green apples = 75 apples

Now, let's find the total number of apples ordered.

Total number of apples ordered:
Total number of apples for students who want fruit + Total number of apples for students who did not want fruit + Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered

Using what we've calculated so far, we can substitute numbers into this equation.

Total number of apples ordered:
105 apples + 75 apples + Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered

We want to find the number of extra apples, so we can rewrite the equation to solve for that.

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - (Total number of apples for students who want fruit + Total number of apples for students who did not want fruit)

Using our previous calculations for the total number of apples for students who want fruit and did not want fruit, we can find the number of extra apples.

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - (105 apples + 75 apples)

Let's say the Total number of apples ordered is z.

Number of extra apples:
z apples - (105 apples + 75 apples) = Number of extra apples

Solving for the number of extra apples:
z = Number of extra apples + 105 apples + 75 apples

Using this formula, we can find the total number of apples ordered, including the extra apples that weren't eaten.

Total number of apples ordered:
Number of extra apples + 105 apples + 75 apples = z apples

To summarize, we found the number of red and green apples ordered for the students who want fruit, determined the total number of apples ordered for all students, and then found the number of extra apples left over.

The final answer is {The total number of apples ordered is z apples}.</s>",16,16.0,75.0

Let's call the number of books in the bin before selling 3 books x. We are given that x = 4. After selling 3 books, the number of books left in the bin is x - 3. We don't know how many books were sold after putting 10 more books in the bin, so let's call this unknown quantity y.

The total number of books in the bin with the new books added is x + 10. Out of these, (x - 3) books were left from the original 4 books, and y more books were sold. So the total number of books sold is (x - 3) + y.

We have two equations with two unknowns:

x + 10 = (x - 3) + y
x - 3 = number of books left after new books added

We can solve for x and y by setting up a system of equations:

x + 10 = (x - 3) + y
   - (x - 3) 
---------------
          10

y = 10

Now we know that y = 10. To find x, we can use either equation above:

x - 3 = number of books left after new books added
x - 3 = x + 10 - 10 (substituting y = 10)
x - 3 = x (simplifying)
x = 3

So there will be 3 books in the bin. Here's the reasoning in steps:

1. Let's call the number of books in the bin before selling 3 books x.
2. We are given that x = 4.
3. After selling 3 books, the number of books left in the bin is x - 3.
4. We don't know how many books were sold after putting 10 more books in the bin, so let's call this unknown quantity y.
5. The total number of books in the bin with the new books added is x + 10.
6. Out of these, (x - 3) books were left from the original 4 books, and y more books were sold.
7. The total number of books sold is (x - 3) + y.
8. We have two equations with two unknowns: x + 10 = (x - 3) + y and x - 3 = number of books left after new books added.
9. We can solve for x and y by setting up a system of equations and solving for y.
10. We find that y = 10.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dollars Mike has left after spending money on mower blades. This amount can then be used to buy 8-dollar games. Let's break down the problem into steps, showing our reasoning clearly.

Step 1: Find the amount of money Mike spent on mower blades
We know that Mike spent ! 10 : dollars ; buying new mower blades. To find how many dollars this is, let's represent the number ! (42) in base 2:

42 (base 10) = 10110 (base 2)

Now let's convert each digit of this binary number to a decimal value:

1 * 2^5 (32) + 0 * 2^4 (16) + 1 * 2^3 (8) + 1 * 2^2 (4) + 0 * 2^1 (2) + 0 * 2^0 (1)

This gives us:

Money spent on mower blades = 32 dollars

Step 2: Find the total amount Mike earned
We know that Mike made 42 ! dollars mowing lawns over the summer. We can find the decimal equivalent of this binary number by converting each digit:

42 (base 10) = 10101 (base 2)

Again, let's convert each digit to a decimal value:

1 * 2^6 (64) + 0 * 2^5 (32) + 1 * 2^4 (16) + 0 * 2^3 (8) + 1 * 2^2 (4) + 1 * 2^1 (2) + 0 * 2^0 (1)

This gives us:

Total amount Mike earned = 86 dollars

Step 3: Find the amount Mike has left after buying new mower blades
Let's subtract the amount Mike spent on mower blades from the total amount he earned:

Money left after buying new mower blades = Total amount Mike earned - Money spent on mower blades

So, we have:

Money left after buying new mower blades = 86 - 32 = 54 dollars

Step 4: Find how many 8-dollar games Mike can buy with the money he has left
We know that Mike can buy 8-dollar games with the money he has left. Let's find out how many he can buy:

Number of games Mike can buy = Money left after buying new mower blades / Cost of each game

So, we have:

Number of games Mike can buy = 54 / 8 = 6.75 games (rounded down to integer value)

If we round down to an integer, Mike can buy 6 games with the money he has left.

The final answer is 6 games.</s>",4,4.0,6.0

To find out how long it will take the chef to cook the remaining 8 potatoes, we can use the given information and apply it in steps.

1. Find the total number of potatoes that need to be cooked:
   13 potatoes are required, and 5 of them have already been cooked. So the remaining number of potatoes is 13 - 5 = 8.

2. Determine the time it takes to cook 1 potato:
   Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook. Therefore, the time taken to cook 1 potato is 6 minutes.

3. Calculate the time it takes to cook the remaining 8 potatoes:
   The time taken to cook 8 potatoes is equal to 8 times the time taken to cook 1 potato. This can be written mathematically as:
   
   Let the time taken to cook the remaining 8 potatoes be x minutes.
   
   x = 8 * 6 = 48 minutes.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of math and science problems left for Paige to do during the time interval between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM. Let's call the number of math problems left as x, and the number of science problems left as y.

We know that Paige had a total of 43 math problems and 12 science problems for homework. Furthermore, we were given that at 3:00 PM, she had already solved 44 math problems. This means that at that time, the number of math problems she had left (x) was:

x = 43 - 44
x = -1 math problem (Paige cannot have a negative number of math problems, so this is incorrect)

Therefore, at this point, we know that we have made a mistake, as the equation does not make sense. We need to analyze the information we have been given more carefully.

Let's look at the number of science problems instead. We were informed that Paige had 12 science problems, and at 3:00 PM, she had already done some of them, solving a total of 44 math problems. Therefore, the number of science problems she still had left is:

y = 12 - (44 - 12)
y = 12 science problems (all of them)

Now let's analyze the number of math problems remaining. We know that Paige solved 44 math problems by 3:00 PM, and she has a total of 43 math problems. Thus, by 3:00 PM, she had:

44 math problems solved

Since Paige started working on math problems at some unknown time before 3:00 PM, we can't calculate exactly how many math problems she had started working on. However, we can calculate the number she had left (x) using the same approach we used above. The only difference is that we replace the given value of the number of math problems she solved at 3:00 PM with the number of math problems solved by 3:00 PM, which is 44. Thus:

x = 43 - 44
x = -1 math problem (Paige cannot have a negative number of math problems, indicating that our first mathematical calculation was incorrect)

This is a logical contradiction due to an error in the question's formulation, which is a common misconception. The number of math problems left cannot be negative. This means that we have made a mistake in our calculations, probably by using the number of math problems solved at 3:00 PM incorrectly or misunderstanding the statement.

In any case, since we concluded that the number of math problems x cannot be negative, it means:

x ≥ 0

To calculate the remaining number of math problems, we know that after 3:00 PM, she solved (x) more math problems, and by 4:00 PM, she had solved a total of 44 + x math problems.

We can calculate the final outcome by creating a system of equations (similar to simultaneous equations):

1. 44 math problems were solved before 3:00 PM
2. X math problems were solved between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM
3. The total number of math problems solved at 4:00 PM is 44 + x

Therefore, our system of equations is:

1. 44 = x1
2. X = x2
3. 44 + x2 = x3 (x3 is the total number of math problems solved by 4:00 PM)

Let's write this in a matrix format:

   x1    x2
[ 1   0 ]    [ 44 ]   →   System 1
      0   1  
[ 0   1 ]    [ 0 ]   →   System 2
      1   0  
[ 1   0 ]    [ 0 ]   →   System 3

We can now calculate the inverse of the coefficient matrix (the matrix to the left of the systems). If the determinant of the matrix is not zero, we can calculate the values of x1, x2, and x3:

    [ 1  0 ]
[ 0  1 ]   →   Inverse matrix

Let's multiply this matrix by the",11,11.0,0.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps.

1. April's florist had a sale where all flowers were discounted. Let's call that discount percentage ""x"".

2. Before the sale, each flower cost $ (let's call this unknown number ""y""). After the sale, each flower cost $ (y - x).

3. During the sale, there was an exclamation mark (!) which could indicate a high level of excitement or energy, but it's more likely a typo and really means ""{"". So, we'll assume that's a typo.

4. Vanessa bought 3 roses and 3 daisies. Each rose cost $y, and each daisy cost $ (let's call this unknown number ""z"").

5. Let's start with finding out how much April charged for each flower during the sale. Each rose cost $ (y - x) and each daisy cost $ (z - x).

6. Now, let's find how much Vanessa spent on her flowers. She bought 3 roses, which cost a total of $9 (3 times ($y - x)) and 3 daisies, which cost a total of $9 (3 times ($z - x)).

7. When we add those two amounts, we get the total cost of Vanessa's flowers: $18 ($9 for roses + $9 for daisies).

8. To summarize, the unknowns in this problem are y, the price of a rose before the sale, and z, the price of a daisy before the sale. We've figured out how to find the cost of each flower during the sale, and we know how much Vanessa spent altogether. Now we're ready to put everything together.

9. Starting with y, we know that $y - x$ was the price of each flower during the sale. Subtracting x from both sides of this equation, we get $y = ($y - x$) + x$. Simplifying this equation, we get $y = y - x + x$. Since ""y"" appears in two different positions in this equation (as both a starting point and a result), we can do some rearranging. This results in $y = x$.

10. Now, let's consider z. We know that $z - x$ was the price of each daisy during the sale. Once again, let's subtract x from both sides of this equation to get $z = ($z - x$) + x$. Simplifying this equation, we get $z = z - x + x$.

11. Since ""z"" appears in two different positions in this equation (as both a starting point and a result), we can rearrange as we did with ""y"". This results in $z = x$.

12. We can now replace ""x"" in our equation for the cost of each flower during the sale ($y - x$) with its value of ""0"", as we've found that both y and z are discounted by the same percentage.

13. With this, we get that each flower costs $y - 0$, or $y$ dollars during the sale. During the sale, Vanessa bought 3 roses and 3 daisies. Each rose cost $y$, and each daisy cost $z$. Using this and what we know about her total spend, we can now use a system of linear equations to find out the values of y and z.

14. Here's our linear system.

    $y = 8$ (the price before the sale for each flower)
    $3y + 3z = 18$ (Vanessa's total cost)

15. Let's solve this system of linear equations using a method like substitution or elimination. Since we've set out to find y and z, we'll swap the positions of those variables to make life easier.

16. Once we've solved the system of linear equations, the unknown values ""y"" and ""z"" will be found, allowing us to find out the full price of each flower before the sale ($(y - 8)$ for the roses and $(z - 8)$ for the daisies).

17. The final answer is:

    y = $6
    z = $2

Number of pictures from phone = 5
Number of pictures from camera = 35

Let x be the number of pictures in each album. We need to distribute a total of (5 + 35) = 40 pictures into 8 albums with the same number of pictures in each album.

We can use the formula for finding the number of items in each group (x) when distributing a total number of items (40) into a certain number of groups (8):

x1 = x2 = ... = x8 = (Total number of items) / (Number of groups)

40 = 8x

40 / 8 = 8x / 8

5 = x

The number of pictures in each album is 5.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cookie baggies Robin can make using the given information. First, we know that each cookie baggie contains 0.6 cookies. Let's call this the ""bag quantity"" (bq). Robin has a total of 23 chocolate chip cookies (cc) and 25 oatmeal cookies (om).

To find the total number of cookies Robin has, we add cc and om:
total number of cookies = cc + om
total number of cookies = 23 + 25
total number of cookies = 48

Next, we need to determine how many cookies of each type will be in each baggie. To do this, we divide the total number of cc and om by the number of baggies Robin can make. This gives us the number of cc and om in each baggie:
number of cc in each baggie = cc / number of baggies
number of cc in each baggie = 23 / (number of baggies)
number of om in each baggie = om / (number of baggies)
number of om in each baggie = 25 / (number of baggies)

We now have all the information we need to find the number of baggies Robin can make. We use the formula for finding the number of baggies as follows:
number of baggies = total number of cookies / (number of cc in each baggie + number of om in each baggie - bq)

Let's substitute the values we've found for the variables:
number of baggies = 48 / (23 / n + 25 / n - 0.6)

To find n, we set up an equation and simplify:
(23 / n + 25 / n - 0.6) = 48

We can't find n by direct solution since n does not appear alone on the left-hand side. Instead, we apply some algebraic manipulation:
23 / n + 25 / n = 48 - 0.6

We combine the common term on the left-hand side:
(23 + 25) / n = 48 - 0.6

Now we find the value of n:
n = (48 - 0.6) / (23 + 25)

We substitute this back into the original equation:
number of baggies = 48 / ((23 / ((48 - 0.6) / (23 + 25))) + (25 / ((48 - 0.6) / (23 + 25))) - 0.6)

The final answer is:

Let's simplify the problem by using variables for the amounts spent on birthdays, games, and the final amount Cody has.

Let x be the amount Cody spent on his birthday.
Let y be the amount Cody spent on the new game.
Let z be the amount of money Cody has now.

We know that Cody had $45 at the beginning. For his birthday, he spent x dollars and received 9 more dollars, for a net gain of 9 dollars. This means that Cody's new total wealth was x + 9. He then spent y dollars on the new game, leaving him with z - y dollars.

Let's write out what we know:

- Cody had $45 at the beginning.
- Cody spent x dollars on his birthday.
- Cody gained 9 dollars on his birthday.
- Cody spent y dollars on the new game.
- Cody's total wealth is now z dollars.

To find the amount Cody spent on his birthday, we can set up and solve an equation:

x + 9 = 45 (Cody's wealth after birthday minus the 9 gifts)

We can easily solve for x:

x = $36 (The amount Cody spent on his birthday)

Now that we know how much Cody spent on his birthday, we can find how much he spent on the game:

z - y = x + 9 + y (The final amount minus the game)

Let's simplify this to make it easier to work with:

z - y = x + y + 9

Next, we'll solve for y:

z - 2y = 36 + 9

Let's do some math here:

- (z - 2y = 45) subtract 9 for simplification
- (z - 2y = 36) multiply both sides by -1/2
- (-2y/-1) = (-36 + z)/-2
- (y) = (-18 + z/2)

Therefore, Cody spent $(-18 + z/2)$ on the game.

Finally, we can find what Cody's total wealth now is. We've already calculated his final wealth (z), but we can calculate it again by finding the total amount Cody spent and adding that to what he started with:

Total wealth = starting wealth + spending

Substituting the amounts of Cody's spending for the birthday and the game:

Total wealth = 45 + 36 - 19

Total wealth = 62 dollars {The final answer is}.</s>",35,35.0,62.0

To solve this problem, we can create a system of equations using the given information. Let x represent the number of pictures in each of the four albums on Facebook, and let y represent the number of pictures in each of the two albums from the digital camera. The total number of pictures uploaded to Facebook is 22x, and the total number of pictures uploaded from the digital camera is 2y. Since we know the total number of pictures uploaded is the same on both devices, we can set this equal to the sum of the Facebook albums and the digital camera albums:

22x + 2y = (4x) + y

Let's distribute the 4x and combine like terms:

22x + 2y = 4x + y

Now, let's isolate y to find the number of pictures in each of the digital camera albums:

22x - 4x = y

18x = y

y = 18x

To find the number of pictures in each Facebook album, we can set up another system with three equations:

x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 22 (total number of Facebook pictures)
x1 = x2 = x3 = x4 (equal number in each album)

We can solve this system using a method like substitution or matrices. Let's use substitution here:

Replace x1 with x in the second equation, and then replace x1 with this expression in the first equation:

x + x + x + x = 22

4x = 22

x = 5.5

Since x must be a whole number, there are not enough pictures to divide evenly among four albums. In order for each album to have an equal number of pictures, Wendy must sort them into three albums. Let's update our system:

x1 + x2 + x3 = 22 (total number of Facebook pictures)
x1 = x2 = x3 (equal number in each album)

Replace x1 with x in the second equation, and then replace x1 with this expression in the first equation:

x + x + x = 22

3x = 22

x = 7

There are 7 pictures in each Facebook album, and each album from the digital camera contains 18 pictures. Therefore, Wendy has 21 pictures (7 from each Facebook album and 6 from each digital camera album) in total. Here's the final answer:

- Each Facebook album has 7 pictures.
- Each album from the digital camera has 18 pictures.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out how many pieces of candy Katie initially had, which is given as 8. We will call this quantity K.
2. Determine how many pieces of candy Katie's sister had initially, which is given as 23. We will call this quantity S.
3. Find out how many pieces of candy the sisters ate on the first night. Katie ate 8, and we don't know how many pieces her sister ate, but we can say that since they combined their candies, they both ate some amount. Let's call this value I (for ""initial"").
4. Calculate how many pieces of candy the sisters have left. First, we need to find out how many pieces did Katie's sister have after they ate I pieces, and then we can find the total number of candies that remained between them. Since they both ate I pieces, the total number of candies they ate on the first night is I + 8 (8 from Katie and I from her sister). Now, when Katie's sister ate I pieces, she initially had S pieces, so after she ate I pieces, she had S - I pieces.
5. Once we have the final number of candies for Katie's sister, we can add it to the number of candies Katie still has to get the total number of candies left.

Now that we know the steps involved, let's follow them to solve the problem.

1. K = 8
2. S = 23
3. I is unknown, but we know that the sisters ate a total of I + 8 candy pieces on their first night.

To find I, we can say:

I + 8 = S - I (number of candies eaten by both sisters on the first night equals the difference in the number of candies between Katie's sister and Katie before eating)

We can then solve for I:

I = S - I - 8 (subtracting the number of candies that Katie ate on the first night)

By applying algebraic terms, we get:

2I = S - 16

Now let's find how many candies Katie's sister and Katie have left.

The number of candies Katie's sister has left is:

S - I (number of candies left with Katie's sister after they both ate I pieces)

And the number of candies Katie has left is:

K (number of candies left with Katie after she ate 8 pieces on the first night)

So the total number of candies left for both sisters would be:

(S - I) + K

Now, let's put the whole formula together:

2I = S - 16

(S - I) + K = {The final answer is}

We can calculate the final answer by substituting the result obtained after solving the quadratic equation 2I = S - 16 for I into the expression for the total number of candies left.

1. First, let's define some variables. Number of trays from the first table is x, and number of trays from the second table is y. Let's also define n as the total number of trays that Jerry had to pick up, which is the sum of the trays from both tables. So, n = x + y.

2. Jerry can only carry 8 trays at a time. So, let's assume he makes t trips. Hence, the number of trays in each trip is 8. This means,

  a. In the first trip, Jerry carries 8 trays from the first table, i.e., 8 out of x trays, and from the second table, he carries no tray as he hasn't visited the second table yet. Therefore, first trip picks up 8 x 0 = 0 trays.

  b. In the second trip, Jerry carries the remaining x-8 trays from the first table, and no trays from the second table. This makes total 8 trays in the second trip.

  c. Similarly, the third trip completes the pickup of the remaining trays from the first table, and till then, he hasn't visited the second table. This gives us 8 more trays.

  d. The fourth trip is the first trip to the second table. During this trip, Jerry carries all the y trays from the second table and also carries 8 trays from the first table as he was returning back. Therefore, this trip carries (8+y) trays.

  e. In the fifth trip, Jerry again carries 8 trays from the first table, and zero trays from the second table, as the second table is already empty after the fourth trip.

  f. In the sixth trip, he has completed picking from both tables.

  So, the total number of trays Jerry picks up in 6 trips is 6 x 8 = 48 trays, which is equal to n.

3. From the last step, we have 6 x 8 = n. Let's substitute n = x + y in the above formula to get,

  6(x+y)/8 = x+y.

  6(5/4)x/8 = x,

  5/3x = x. Simplifying further, we get,

  x = 3x.

  Since, the number of trays is non-negative, the above equation can't have a real number solution. Therefore, there is no way Jerry can pick up 9 trays from the first table and 7 trays from the second table, even if he made infinite trips because the number of trays is an integer.

  {The final answer is: It is not possible to pick up 9 trays from the first table and 7 trays from the second table, given the conditions defined in the problem statement.}

Alternatively, the problem could be formulated as a system of linear equations and solved using the technique of Gaussian Elimination, as done in some high school curricula. But solving for particular values of the variables (i.e., x and y) is computationally more straightforward than solving for the general case (i.e., obtaining coefficients of x and y).</s>",2,2.0,7.0

Faye's score from finding treasures on the first level is 7 points times the number of treasures she found, which is 2. This gives us a score of 14 points through finding treasures on the first level {The final answer is 14 points}.

Moving on to the second level, Faye found 6 treasures here, and as before, we calculate her points by finding 7 points times the number of treasures, which is 42 points in total from finding treasures on the second level {The final answer is 42 points}.

Now we add up the points she earned from finding treasures across both levels. She earned 14 points from level one and 42 points from level two, bringing her total score from finding treasures to 56 points {The final answer is 56 points}.

However, this doesn't take into account any potential bonus points or other rewards Faye may have earned in the game. These could be added on top of the points she earned from finding treasures, but without this information, we can't include any additional score.

<|assistant|>
To find the total number of carrots Megan has, we need to calculate the number of carrots she had after picking 19 on the first day and throwing out 4, and add the number of carrots she picked on the second day.

Let's call the number of carrots Megan had after the first day x. So, Megan initially picked 19 carrots, which means x = 19. After throwing out 4 carrots, she has x-4 carrots. The equation to calculate the number of carrots after the first day would be:

x - 4 = 19 - 4

x = 15

Now, let x1 be the number of carrots Megan had after day 1. After picking 46 more carrots, she would have a total of x1 + 46 carrots. Her total number of carrots will be the sum of the number of carrots she had after day 1 (x1) and the number of carrots she picked on day 2 (46). So, the total number of carrots would be:

x1 + 46

But, we also know that after day 1, Megan had x1 carrots. After throwing out 4 carrots, she had x1 - 4. We can relate both these equations to find x1:

x1 - 4 = 15

x1 = 19

Substituting the value of x1 in the equation to find the total number of carrots:

x1 + 46 = 19 + 46

x1 + 46 = 65

The final answer would be {65}. In other words, Megan would have a total of 65 carrots.</s>",61,61.0,65.0

To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps:

1. Number of files before deletion: 82

3. Number of files left: 82 - 37 = 45
4. Number of folders with 1 file: Unknown
5. Number of folders with 5 files: Unknown

Let's first find the number of folders with 1 file. This can be found by dividing the number of remaining files by the number of files in each folder:

7. Number of folders with 1 file: ~45 files / 1 file = 45 folders

Now, let's find the number of folders with 5 files:

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total number of players on the team. We are given that there are 44 returning players and 12 new players. The total number of players is the sum of these two quantities:
   Total players = 44 returning players + 12 new players
   Total players = 56 players
   {The total number of players on the team is 56.}

2. Next, we need to find the number of groups if there are 8 players in each group. If there are 56 players and 8 players in each group, then divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group:
   Number of groups = Total players ÷ Number of players per group
   Number of groups = 56 players ÷ 8 players per group
   Number of groups = 7 groups
   {There are 7 groups with 8 players in each group on the team.}

3. Finally, we can find the number of new players in each group. Since we have 7 groups and 12 new players, we can find the number of new players in each group by dividing the number of new players by the number of groups:
   Number of new players per group = Total new players ÷ Number of groups
   Number of new players per group = 12 new players ÷ 7 groups
   Number of new players per group = 1.71 new players per group
   Since we cannot have a fraction of a player, we have to round up or down. If the coach will put these new players in every group, then this number should be rounded up, so each group will have 2 new players:
   {Each group will have 6 returning players and 2 new players.}

4. Let's also find the number of returning players in each group. Since each group has 8 players, the remaining players in the group should be the returning players:
   Returning players per group = Number of players per group - Number of new players per group
   Returning players per group = 8 players per group - 2 new players per group
   Returning players per group = 6 returning players per group
   {Each group will have 6 returning players and 2 new players.}

With these steps, we can say that:

- There are 56 players on the team, of which 12 are new and 44 are returning.
- The coach will form 7 groups, each with 8 players (6 returning players and 2 new players).
- Each group will have a total of 8 players (6 returning players and 2 new players).

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Given: Will earned $104 mowing lawns over the summer.
2. Will spent $41:00 on a new mower and blades.
3. It costs $9:00 for a game.
4. Our goal is to find out how many games Will could buy with the money he had left after buying the mower and playing games.

To find out how many games he could buy, we need to calculate the amount left after he bought the mower and spent money on games.

So, here's how we do it:

1. Will earned $104 mowing lawns over the summer. This is our starting point.

2. Will spent $41:00 on a new mower and blades. Let's subtract this amount from the total he earned to find out how much money he still has left:

   $104 - $41 = $63 left

3. To purchase a game, Will spends $9:00. Now, let's calculate how many games Will could buy with the money he still has left.

   Let x represent the number of games he could buy.

   $63 can buy x games at $9:00 each.

   We can express this as an equation:

   $63 = x * $9:00

   To solve for x, we can divide both sides of this equation by $9:00:

   $63 / $9:00 = x

   Now, let's use decimal notation to solve it:

   $6.30 = x

   We rounded the result since $9:00 is $90.00, and we only have the number of dollars.

4. Our final answer is:

   Will could buy {6.3} games (approximately 63 games) with the money he had left after buying the mower and playing games.

To find the total number of carrots Nancy picked in both days, we can add the number of carrots she picked in the first day with the total number of carrots in the second day.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the given conditions using variables and equations. Let's assign a variable x to the number of dollars Roger received as a gift and y to the number of dollars he spent on the new game. Our equations then become:

x + 16 = dollars before buying the game
x + 16 + 28 - 25 = dollars after buying the game

We can solve for the unknown variables by setting up a system of equations:

x + 16 = y - 12 (Let y be the number of dollars Roger had after buying the game. Then his spending on the game is y - 16, and the discounted price is $28 - $12 = $16.)

x + 16 + 28 - 25 = y

Next, we can isolate the variables to get a new system:

x - y = -12 (subtract y from both sides)
x = y - 12

x + 28 - 25 = y (substitute the first equation for x)

y - 12 - 12 = y - 24
y - 36 = y - 24

y = y - 24 (we can cancel y because it occurs on both sides.)

y + 24 = 36
y = 12

Therefore, Roger has 12 dollars now, and the final answer is:

{The final answer is: Roger has 12 dollars now.}

We can substitute 12 for y in the first equation to find the number of dollars Roger received as a gift:

x + 16 = 12 - 12 (substitute 12 for y)
x + 16 = x

x = 0

Applying the boundary condition, Roger received zero dollars as a gift, which is unlikely. This may imply that the given conditions are inconsistent, and the question may contain an error. More details or clarification may be needed to make this a valid problem.

Without further information, this solution was obtained following the instructions provided. The discrepancy may arise from the ambiguity in the term ""for"" in the statement ""for his birthday he got...""

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the information provided to set up two equations, one for the number of cans on Saturday and another for the number of cans on Sunday. We can then use these equations to find the unknown variables in each equation and then use the second equation to calculate the total number of cans collected.

Let x be the number of empty bags Sam had on Saturday, and y be the number of empty bags he had on Sunday. Let z be the number of cans in each filled bag on both Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, Sam filled 3 bags with z cans each, so the total number of cans collected on Saturday is 3z.

On Sunday, in addition to the 3 bags he filled on Saturday, Sam filled an additional 4 empty bags with z cans each, for a total of 4z cans.

Therefore, the total number of cans collected on Sunday is the sum of the number of cans collected on Saturday and the number of cans collected on Sunday only (excluding the bags filled on Saturday), which is the difference between the number of empty bags he had on Sunday and the number of empty bags he had on Saturday, multiplied by z:

(3 bags filled on Saturday with z cans each) + (4 bags filled on Sunday with z cans each, excluding the bags filled on Saturday)

3z + (4 - x)z = (4 + x)z

z(3 + 4 - x) = (4 + x)z

z(7 - x) = 4z

z(7 - x) = 4z ⟹ (7 - x) = 4

Substitute (7 - x) = 4 into the formula for the number of cans on Sunday:

(3 bags filled on Saturday with z cans each) + (4 empty bags + x empty bags filled on Sunday with z cans each)

3z + 4z + xz = (4 + x)z

7z + xz = (4 + x)z

xz = (4 - 7)z

xz = -3z

If xz < 0, it's not possible to have a negative number of bags, so xz = 0. This means x = 0, which means that Sam did not have any empty bags on Saturday. 

Now, we can use the information that each bag held z cans to find out how many cans Sam collected on Sunday. Since we know that the number of empty bags he had on Sunday was x = 0, the formula for the number of cans collected on Sunday is:

(3 bags filled on Saturday with z cans each) + (4 empty bags filled on Sunday with z cans each)

3z + 4z = (4)z

7z = (4)z

z = 4

The number of cans in each filled bag is 4, so Sam collected a total of 4z = 4 * 3 + 4 = 16 cans on Sunday.

Finally, we can use the formula for the total number of cans collected (Saturday and Sunday) to find the total:

Total number of cans = Number of cans on Saturday + Number of cans on Sunday

Total number of cans = (3 bags filled on Saturday with z cans each) + (4 empty bags filled on Sunday with z cans each)

Total number of cans = 3z + 4z = 7z

Substituting z = 4, we find the total number of cans collected:

Total number of cans = 7(4) = 28 cans

Let's call the number of problems on each worksheet as x. We know that there are 4 problems on one worksheet.

The total number of problems in 16 worksheets is:

16 worksheets with 4 problems each = 64 problems in total.

We also know that 8 of the 16 worksheets have been graded. Let's call the number of problems that still need to be graded in these 8 worksheets as y.

The total number of problems still waiting to be graded is:

y problems in the 8 graded worksheets + (16-8) worksheets with the full 4 problems each = (y + 32) problems waiting to be graded.

Now we want to find the total number of problems still waiting to be graded. This is the sum of the problems still waiting to be graded in the graded worksheets (y) and the problems still waiting to be graded in the remaining ungraded worksheets (also 32, as there are 4 problems per worksheet and 8 worksheets have already been graded).

The total number of problems still waiting to be graded is:

y problems in the 8 graded worksheets + 32 problems in the 8 ungraded worksheets = (y + 32) problems waiting to be graded in total.

To relate this back to our original statement about the total number of problems waiting to be graded, we can equate the two expressions to find y.

y problems in the 8 graded worksheets + 32 problems in the 8 ungraded worksheets = (y + 32) problems waiting to be graded in total.

This means that the total number of problems waiting to be graded is the sum of the problems in the graded worksheets (y) and the problems still waiting to be graded in the ungraded worksheets (32). 

To find how many more problems she has to grade, we can subtract the number of problems she's already graded from the total number of problems waiting to be graded:

16 * 4 (the number of problems on each worksheet) - 8 * 4 (the number of problems already graded from the 8 graded worksheets) = Number of remaining ungraded problems.

Substitute the expression we found earlier for the total number of problems waiting to be graded into this last equation:

y problems in the 8 gradged worksheets + 32 problems in the 8 ungraded worksheets = (y + 32) problems waiting to be graded in total.

(16 * 4 - 8 * 4) problems remaining + y problems remaining = (y + 32) problems remaining.

Now, we want to write an expression for the number of remaining ungraded problems and the number of remaining ungraded problems in the graded worksheets.

The number of remaining ungraded problems in the graded worksheets is the number of remaining problems after subtracting the number of problems already graded from the number of problems originally on those worksheets.

The number of remaining ungraded problems in the graded worksheets is:

4 problems on each graded worksheet - (number of problems already graded on each graded worksheet) = Number of remaining ungraded problems in the graded worksheets.

Now, substitute the expression for the number of remaining ungraded problems in the graded worksheets into our new expression for the number of remaining ungraded problems:

(4 problems remaining per graded worksheet - (number of problems already graded on each graded worksheet)) + y problems remaining per graded worksheet = Number of remaining ungraded problems remaining in total.

Simplify this expression:

(4 - (x - 8)) + y = (y + 32) problems remaining.

Now, let's equate the expressions we found earlier for the total number of remaining ungraded problems and the total number of remaining ungraded problems remaining in total:

(y + 32) problems remaining = ((y + x - 8) + y) problems remaining.

This lets us replace the expression for the total number of remaining ungraded problems in terms of y and x.

To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of scarves and mittens that Paige has in total after unboxing all 6 boxes. To do this, we can use multiplication to find the number of scarves and mittens in each box, and then add up the total for all 6 boxes.

Each box has 5 scarves and 5 mittens. So, in total, Paige has 30 scarves (5 scarves in each of the 6 boxes) and 30 mittens (again, 5 mittens in each box). We can write this as:

30 scarves and 30 mittens in total

Now, we can use addition to find the total number of winter clothing items that Paige has after unboxing all 6 boxes. We just need to add the number of scarves and mittens we found before.

Let's call the total number of winter clothing items that Paige has x.

x scarves and x mittens in total

If we add the number of scarves and mittens we found earlier, we should get the same answer we get if we add the number of scarves and mittens to x.

30 scarves and 30 mittens in total
x scarves and x mittens in total

Using addition, we can see that the total number of winter clothing items (in both scarves and mittens) is equal to the sum of the number of scarves and the number of mittens:

30 scarves + 30 mittens = x scarves + x mittens

Using algebra, we can isolate x, the total number of winter clothing items, on one side of the equation:

x scarves + x mittens = 30 scarves + 30 mittens

At this point, it's up to us whether we want to find the total number of scarves, or the total number of mittens, or both. Here, let's find the total number of winter clothing items, which is represented by the variable x.

We can subtract the number of mittens (which we know is 30) from both sides of the equation to find the number of scarves in terms of the total number of winter clothing items, which is x:

x scarves + x (5) = 30 scarves + 30 (5)

Then, we can combine like terms (scarves and mittens) and distribute the x's:

x scarves + 30 = 30 scarves + 150 mittens

From here, we might notice that the number of mittens is much higher than the number of scarves (150 mittens vs. X scarves). To make things easier, we can subtract 150 times the number of mittens from both sides of the equation. This will get rid of the extra information about the number of mittens, and leave us with only the number of scarves in terms of x.

After doing this, we can find the total number of winter clothing items (represented by the variable x) by solving for x:

x scarves = x - 150

In other words, we can find the total number of winter clothing items by finding the number of scarves, and then subtracting the number of mittens (which we already know is 30).

Let's see if this makes sense. Assuming Paige found no other winter clothing items, we can see that with 6 boxes, each with 5 scarves and 5 mittens, she should have found a total number of scarves and mittens (in terms of x) as follows:

x scarves and x mittens in total

Since we know the number of mittens (x/2 - which we found earlier as 30), we can set up a similar equation for x in terms of how many mittens Paige found (30):

30 scarves and 30 mittens in total

Comparing these two equations, let's see what we can learn. First, we can see that the total number of winter clothing items is equal to the sum of the number of scarves and the number of mittens (which we wrote as the ""x scarves and x mittens in total""). If we subtract the number of mittens from both sides of the equation, we can find the number of scarves in terms of x (represented by the left side of the equation). Then, we can repeat this process",60,60.0,30.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to find the missing variables. Let's define some variables:

x = the number of potatoes left to be cooked
y = the time it takes to cook each potato (in minutes)
z = the total time it takes for the chef to cook the remaining potatoes

We can write equations for the amount of potatoes and cooking time based on the information provided:

12 = 6 + x (the total number of potatoes is the sum of the ones already cooked and the remaining ones)
6 * 6/y = z (the chef has already cooked 6 potatoes for a total time of 6 * 6/y)

We can then substitute the first equation in the second to eliminate x from the second:

12 = 6 + (12 - 6)
6 * 6/y = z

Solving for z:

z = (12 - 6) * 6/y = 6 * (2 - 1) * 6/y = 6 * 6/y = 36/y minutes

We can now find the value of y:

y = 6 * 6/6 = 6 minutes per potato

The final answer is:

The chef will need {36/6 = } 6 minutes to cook the remaining {12 - 6 = } 6 potatoes, for a total time of {36/6 + 6*6/6 = } 12 minutes.</s>",36,36.0,12.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we will need to follow each step of the given information.

1. Initially, Luke had 57 old games. {The initial number of games is 57.}
2. Luke sold 39 of those games. {This leaves Luke with 18 games (57-39).}
3. Luke then packed up the remaining 18 games and put 2 games into each box. {This means each box now contains 2 games.}
4. We don't know how many boxes Luke used, but we're asked to find out. {We can begin by calculating how many games were in the boxes after Luke finished packing them up.}
5. Luke packed up all 18 remaining games, which means he put 9 games (18 ÷ 2) into each of the required number of boxes. {Now, we can calculate how many games are in all the boxes (excluding the already sold 39 games and the 2 games left over).}
6. Each box now contains 9 games, let x be the number of boxes Luke used. {There are 9x games in the required number of boxes.)}
7. We know that the total number of games after Luke finished packing is equal to the number of games Luke had after selling 39 and packing the rest (initial plus sold minus packed). {Putting it all together: Initial number of games = 57, sold 39, packed and moved 18, and have 2 extras left over. Adding them up gives us the initial plus sold minus packed, which is the number of games after packing.}
8. The total number of games after packing should be equal to the number of games left after selling + the number of games in the now-filled boxes. {This lets us set up an equation to solve for x.}
9. Total number of games after packing = Number of games Luke had after selling + Number of games in the now-filled boxes. {Luke had 18 games left after selling 39. Each box contains 9 of these, so there are 9x boxes. Thus, the equation looks like this: 9x + 18 = (Initial number of games - Number of games sold) + (Number of games in the now-filled boxes).}
10. Solving for x: 9x + 18 = (57 - 39) + 9x. {Notice that the number of games in the now-filled boxes and the initial number of games minus the number of games sold cancel each other out.)}
11. Simplifying: 18 = 9x. {Dividing both sides by 9:}
12. x = 2. {We have found the number of boxes required for packing up all the remaining games.}
13. Therefore, the final answer is: Luke used 2 boxes to pack up the remaining games after selling 39 of his old games, where each box contains 2 games. {The final answer is: After selling 39 games and packing the rest into 2 boxes of 2 games each, Luke now has 2 extra games left over.}

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the quantities:
   - Number of roses bought by Emily: 2
   - Number of daisies bought by Emily: 2
   - Price of one rose: $3
   - Price of one daisy: (Given in the problem as discount flowers) Let's assume it's also $3

2. Calculate the price of roses:
   - Price of 2 roses: $3 (per flower) x 2 (number of flowers) = $6

3. Calculate the price of daisies:
   - Price of 2 daisies: $3 (per flower) x 2 (number of flowers) = $6

4. Add up the price of roses and daisies:
   - Total price: $6 (price of roses) + $6 (price of daisies) = $12

5. The final answer is: Emily spent $12 on her flowers during the sale.

So the problem can be expressed as a mathematical formula:

Total price = (Price per flower) x (Number of flowers of the first type) + (Price per flower) x (Number of flowers of the second type) 

In this case, the formula would be:

Total price = ($3 per flower) x 2 (number of roses) + ($3 per flower) x 2 (number of daisies) = $12 

I hope this clear explanation helps you understand the steps required to solve this problem. Let me know if you have any further questions! {The final answer is: Emily spent $12 on her flowers during the sale.}</s>",12,12.0,12.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's assign variables to the unknown quantities:

? = number of puppies
13 = original number of puppies
! = symbol to represent a specific unit that we'll assume is ""puppies"" as well
7 = number of puppies sold in one day
2 = number of puppies in each cage
c = number of cages used

Using this notation, let's represent the initial situation:

? ! 13 !

After selling 7 puppies, we can represent the remaining puppies using the same notation:

(? - 7) ! (13 - 7) !

The number of cages used is equal to the number of remaining puppies divided by the number of puppies in each cage (rounded up, if necessary):

c = (? - 7) / 2

Substituting this into our expression for the original situation gives:

c ! (? - 7) ! 

Solving for ? gives us:

? = (2 * c) + 7

Using our substitution for c, we get:

? = (2 * ((? - 7) / 2)) + 7

Simplifying this expression, we get:

? = (4/2) * ((? - 7) / 2) + 7

Multiplying both the top and bottom constants by 2:

? = 2 * ((2/1) * ((? - 7) / 2)) + 7

Simplifying:

? = 2 * ((? - 7) / 1) + 7

Adding and subtracting 7 from both expressions in the parenthesis:

? = 2 * ((? - 0) / 1) + 14

Simplifying:

? = 2 * ? + 14

Dividing by 2 to eliminate the unnecessary ?:

? = ? + 7

Subtracting ? from both sides:

0 = -? + 7

Dividing by -1:

? = -7

But we don't think that makes sense since we're working with puppies, and we'd expect a non-negative result.

Looking at our original expressio (? = (2 * c) + 7), we can see that the term c is less important in determining the total number of puppies than the original number of ?. This means that if we don't have enough cages, we'll have to sell some of the remaining ? to get rid of some of the puppies. So let's modify our original equation by adding a term to represent the number of puppies sold after the initial day:

?1 ! (13 ! - 7) ! + q = (2 * c) + 7

Here, ?1 represents the number of puppies immediately after day 1, and q represents the number of puppies sold after day 1 (but before being put into cages). Subsequently, the expression between parentheses is how many puppies were left over after the first day's sale. Now we know that q cannot be greater than ?1 - ?2, and q is an integer:

q cannot be greater than ?1 - ?2

This is because there are only a limited number of puppies available, which is less than or equal to ?1. As for the second requirement, q has to be an integer because we are dealing with whole numbers of puppies. To determine the number of cages used, we once again use the previous formula:

c = (?1 - q - 7) / 2

Let's replace q with its equivalent q = ?1 - ?2 - 7:

c = (?1 - ?2 - 7) / 2

Now, let's look at how we came up with the original formula:

q = ?1 - ?2 - 7

Adding and subtracting 7 from both expressions in the parenthesis and replacing q with its equivalent:

q = ?1 - ?3 - 7

?2 = ?3

But ?2 and ?3 are both unknowns, so let's set them equal:

?2 = ?3

Substituting ?2 with ?3 in the original equation for ?1 gives:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. Here's how:

First, we need to find how many carrots Faye and her mother picked in total. That is, we add the number of carrots Faye picked (23) to the number her mother picked (5):

Faye picked 23 carrots.
Her mother picked 5 carrots.
In total, they picked 23 + 5 = 28 carrots.

Next, we know that a total of 12 of these carrots were good. Since we don't know how many good carrots Faye and her mother each picked, we'll represent the good carrots Faye picked as x and the good carrots her mother picked as y. Here's how we can find the total number of good carrots:

Faye picked x good carrots.
Her mother picked y good carrots.
There were a total of 12 good carrots.
x + y = 12

Now, we know that not all the carrots they picked were good. Let's say there were b bad carrots. We can find the total number of carrots they picked that weren't good:

Faye and her mom picked a total of 28 carrots.
Of those, 12 were good, so there must have been b bad carrots in total.
The total number of carrots they picked that weren't good was the number Faye picked that weren't good (let's call that x′) plus the number her mother picked that weren't good (let's call that y′):
x′ + y′ = b

If we assume that both Faye and her mother picked some bad carrots (i.e., x′ and y′ are both nonzero), we can represent the bad carrots each picked using ratios of the total number they each picked. Let's say that x′ is a proportion of the total number Faye picked, and y′ is a proportion of the total number her mother picked. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

x′ = (b/Faye picked this many bad carrots) * (Faye picked in total)
y′ = (b/her mother picked this many bad carrots) * (her mother picked in total)

Now, we know that Faye and her mother picked a total of 28 carrots, and we know how many bad carrots they picked (from the ratio calculation we just did). We can use what we know to find how many bad carrots (and therefore good carrots) they picked:

Faye picked x good carrots and x′ bad carrots:
The number of good carrots Faye picked was x:
x = x good carrots

Her mom picked y good carrots and y′ bad carrots:
The number of good carrots her mother picked was y:
y = y good carrots

Now, Faye and her mom together picked x and y good carrots, as well as x′ and y′ bad carrots. In total, they picked b bad carrots:

Faye and her mom picked a total of b bad carrots:
x′ + y′ = b

But we have already found another, equivalent expression for the bad carrots they picked:

Faye picked x′ bad carrots:
x′ = (b/Faye's number of bad carrots) * (number of carrots Faye picked in total)

Her mom picked y′ bad carrots:
y′ = (b/her mom's number of bad carrots) * (her mom's number of carrots picked in total)

Putting that all together:

We know that a total of 28 carrots were picked.
x good carrots were picked (by Faye), so there must have been some bad carrots, denoted by a prime (x′):
x′ = (b/number of carrots Faye picked this many bad carrots) * (total carrots Faye picked)

Her mom picked y good carrots (denoted by a prime (y′)):
y′ = (b/number of carrots her mom picked this many bad carrots) * (total",16,16.0,28.0

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps, using proper notation and clearly indicating each calculation. Here's how:

1. Isabel picked 66 flowers in total. We'll represent this as I = 66.

2. She made bouquets. Let's represent the number of bouquets as B.

3. Each bouquet had 8 flowers. Let's represent this as b = 8.

4. 10 of the flowers wilted before the wedding. Let's represent the number of wilted flowers as w = 10.

5. The remaining number of flowers that weren't wilted is represented by f, where f = I - w. Substituting our previous values, we get:

  f = 66 - 10 = 56

6. Isabel made B bouquets, and each bouquet had b = 8 flowers. Using similar notation, we'd represent the number of flowers used in all bouquets as f' = b * B. Let's calculate this:

  f' = 8 * B

7. We found that f = 56, so there are 56 flowers that weren't wilted. Of these flowers, f' already went into the bouquets. Let's represent the number of remaining flowers as r.

  r = f - f'

  Substituting our previous values, we get:

  r = 56 - 8 * B

8. Now, we know that w = 10 flowers wilted, and B - w remains the number of bouquets Isabel could still make without wilted flowers. Let's represent this as B'.

  B' = B - w

9. Now, let's find out the number of fresh flowers, f', left after making B' bouquets. Using a similar calculation as in step 7, we can calculate r' as:

  r' = f - f' - (B' * 8)

  Substituting our previous values, we get:

  r' = 56 - 8 * (B - 10) - (B - 10) * 8

10. Finally, let's calculate the number of fresh flowers left that weren't used for the bouquets. These flowers are represented as l.

  l = f - f' - B * 8

  Substituting our previous values, we get:

  l = 56 - 8 * B - B * 8

11. Putting all together, we can find out the final answer that tells us how many more bouquets Isabel could still make without any wilted flowers left.

  Let's represent the final answer as B'' = B' + Bs, where Bs is the number of bouquets she could still make with fresh flowers, l.

  B'' = B' + Bs

   Substituting our previous values, we get:

   B'' = B - 10 + l/(8)

   Solving this for Bs gives:

   Bs = (B - 10) * 8 + l - ((B - 10) * 8)

   Here's how we simplify the expression for Bs:

   Bs = (B - 10) * (8 + (l - 40))

   Now, simplifying it further, we get:

   Bs = (B - 10) * (l - 40)/4

   Finally, putting it all together, we get the final answer:

   B'' = B - 10 + (B - 10) * (l - 40)/4

   {The final answer is} B'' = B*(3/4 - 1/2*w/f)*(f-16*b/3)
   

I hope this explanation helps clarify each step of the calculation. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask! The steps should be interpreted as follows:

1. I = 66: The total number of flowers picked by Isabel is 66.

2. B: Unknown, the number of bouquets Isabel made.

<|assistant|>
First, let's identify the unknowns in the problem. There are two main unknowns: the number of times Oliver rode the Ferris wheel (let's call this variable x) and the number of times Oliver rode the bumper cars (let's call this variable y). There is also a variable for the total number of tickets Oliver used (let's call this variable t).

Now, let's translate the information given into a series of equations. We know that Oliver rode the Ferris wheel x number of times and each ride cost 7 tickets. This means that the number of tickets Oliver spent on the Ferris wheel is 7x.

Similarly, Oliver rode the bumper cars y number of times, and each ride cost 7 tickets. This means that the number of tickets Oliver spent on the bumper cars is 7y.

Next, we know that in total, Oliver used t tickets. This can be broken down into two parts: the tickets Oliver used on the Ferris wheel and the tickets Oliver used on the bumper cars. Since we already know the number of tickets Oliver spent on the Ferris wheel (7x) and the number of tickets Oliver spent on the bumper cars (7y), we can equation that together account for all the tickets Oliver used. 

Here's the full system of equations:

7x = number of tickets Oliver spent on the Ferris wheel
7y = number of tickets Oliver spent on the bumper cars
t = total number of tickets Oliver used

We want to find x, y, and t, so we're going to need to combine these equations to solve for all three variables.

Let's start by combining the equations for the number of tickets Oliver spent on the Ferris wheel and the bumper cars. If we add these equations together, we'll have a new equation that shows us how many total tickets Oliver spent on the Ferris wheel and the bumper cars combined.

7x + 7y = number of total tickets Oliver spent on the Ferris wheel and the bumper cars

Now, we want to find a way to relate this to the equation for the total number of tickets Oliver used. To do this, we'll subtract the equation we just wrote from the equation for the total number of tickets Oliver used. This will eliminate the x term from our system, since we now know how many total tickets Oliver spent on the Ferris wheel and the bumper cars.

t = number of total tickets Oliver used
t = 7x + 7y + (unknown number of tickets Oliver spent on other rides*)

Now, we can subtract the equation for the number of total tickets Oliver spent on the Ferris wheel and the bumper cars from this new equation to eliminate the y term.

t - 7x - 7y = (unknown number of tickets Oliver spent on other rides*)

What does this tell us? This is an equation for t, since we know that t is the total number of tickets Oliver used. The x and y terms are in here because we spent some of those tickets on the Ferris wheel and the bumper cars, but we also spent some on other, unspecified rides. We're going to ignore the unspecified rides for now; we'll deal with them at the end.

Let's simplify our system of equations a little. We know that Oliver rode the Ferris wheel x number of times and the bumper cars y number of times. If we set x and y equal to 5 and 4, respectively, and solve for t, we'll have a specific example to help us understand the system.

7 * 5 = 35 (number of tickets Oliver spent on the Ferris wheel)
7 * 4 = 28 (number of tickets Oliver spent on the bumper cars)

Let's add these two numbers together: 35 + 28 = 63 (number of total tickets Oliver spent on the Ferris wheel and the bumper cars)

We'll subtract this number from our equation for t: 

t - 35 - 28 = (unknown number of tickets Oliver spent on other rides*)

This gives us an equation for:

t - 63 = (unknown number of tickets Oliver spent on other rides*)

We can simplify this equation even more by realizing that the only unknown term left in our equation is the number of tickets Oliver spent on other rides. If we can come up with a way to relate this to the known terms in our equation, we'll be",63,63.0,63.0

Let's define some variables to simplify this problem:

- n = number of chairs
- m = number of tables
- t = time spent on each piece of furniture (in minutes) for assembly
- T = total time spent on all furniture assembly (in minutes)

We can represent the given information as equations:

- Number of chairs: n + n/4 = 4 (Wendy bought a total of 4 chairs, some new and some existing)
- Number of tables: m + m/4 = 4 (Similar to chairs)
  
   From equations (1) and (2), we can get the expression for m and n:

   n = 4(1 - 1/4) = 3
   m = 4(1 - 1/4) = 3

   Note that we get the same value for both n and m since Wendy bought the same number of new chairs and tables.
   
   Now, let's find the total time spent on furniture assembly:

   T = 3 * t + 3 * t/4 = 3t + 3t/4
  
   From equation (3), we can represent the given information as an equation for t since we know T and Wendy spent 6000 pennies in total:

   6000 = 3t + 3t/4
   
   Let's solve for t:

   4 * 6000 = 12t
   4800 = 12t
   400 = t
   
   From equation (4), we can find the time spent on furniture assembly:

To find the number of good games Ned has, we need to first calculate the number of games that do not work. Let's call this number x.

Ned bought 50 games from his friend and x of them do not work. So, the number of working games from his friend is 50 - x.

Ned also bought 27 more games from the garage sale, where all the games work. The total number of working games from the garage sale is 27.

Now, let's combine the two sets of working games. There are (50 - x) working games from his friend and 27 working games from the garage sale, for a total of (50 - x) + 27 working games.

In addition, we need to count the number of non-working games from these sets. The number of non-working games from his friend is x, and there are no non-working games from the garage sale. The total number of non-working games is x from his friend.

The total number of games, both working and non-working, is the sum of the working and non-working games from both sources. This is given to us as 74.

Here's how this works out:

The number of total games is (50 - x) + 27 working games, for a total of 77 working games. The total number of games, working and non-working, is the sum of these two numbers.

74 = (50 - x) + 27 + x

74 = 77 - x

Rearranging, we get -x = -3

Since x is a positive number, this would mean that Ned has a negative number of games, which is not possible. Therefore, our initial assumption that there are more non-working games than working games is incorrect.

In fact, we're told that at least 75% of Ned's games work, but we haven't calculated how many games Ned has in total yet.

Let's go back to our working and non-working games equation:

74 = (50 - x) + 27

Here, we're subtracting x from 50 games to find the number of working games that he bought from his friend. To make sure that at least 75% of the games work, we need at least 39 of these 50 games to work.

This means that we must have:

(50 - x) >= 39

We subtracted x from 50 because we're counting the non-working games (of which we know that there are fewer than 35) as part of this calculation. As such, our working games from the friend are really (50-x), but we're working with the original 50 because we don't know how many of those 50 (x) do not work.

Similarly:

27 >= 20

Now, combine the equations (again, we're working with two different variables of x (one from the friend and one from the garage sale) and we assume that they are the same x):

(50 - x) + 27 >= 69

77 >= 69

Finally, let's calculate the number of working (!) Games, which is the sum of the remaining calculated values.

Working games from friend = (50 - x)

Working games from garage sale = 27

! working games from friend = (50 - x) * 1

Good ! games from friend = ((50 - x) * 1) * 1

Total good (!) games = ! working games from friend + games from garage sale

Substituting our working games equations:

Total good (!) games = ((50 - x) * 1) * 1 + 27

Total good (!) games = ((50-x)*1)*1 + 27

{The final answer is} Total good (!) games = (((50 - x) * 1) * 1 + 27)

{The final answer is} Total good (!) games should be a number between 35 and 77. However, we're not exactly sure how many of 50 games from the friend work, so we're not able to have a more specific answer for the total number of good (!)",3,3.0,50.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of Siamese cats as x and the number of house cats as y. 

Before the sale, we have the following: 

38 Siamese cats (x) and 25 house cats (y) 

Total number of cats before the sale = x + y 

After the sale, we know that 45 cats were sold in total, which can be represented as follows: 

45 cats were sold in total (45) 

The number of Siamese cats sold (let's call it a) can be found by looking at the number of Siamese cats left after the sale. We know there were originally 38 Siamese cats, and then x number of Siamese cats were left over after the sale, so: 

Number of Siamese cats sold = Number of Siamese cats before the sale - Number of Siamese cats left over after the sale (38 - x) 

We can do the same thing for the house cats: 

Number of house cats sold = Number of house cats before the sale - Number of house cats left over after the sale (25 - y) 

Now that we know how many of each type of cat was sold, we can represent the total number of cats sold as follows: 

Total number of cats sold = Number of Siamese cats sold + Number of house cats sold (a + (25 - y)) 

We can also find the total number of cats right now by adding the number of Siamese cats left over (x) and the number of house cats left over (y): 

Total number of cats right now = Number of Siamese cats left over + Number of house cats left over (x + y) 

Now, let's put everything together. After the sale, we know that: 

Total number of cats sold = Total number of cats right now - Total number of cats before the sale (x + y - (38 + 25)) 

Substituting what we know about the number of Siamese cats sold (a) and the number of house cats sold: 

(a + (25 - y)) = (x + y - (38 + 25)) 

After some simplification, we have: 

a + 25 = x + y - 63 

We're almost finished! We can separate out the number of house cats (y) by subtracting off the number of Siamese cats (x) and solving for y: 

y = a + x - 38 

And we're done! We have all the information we need. Plugging the numbers we know into our formula for y: 

Number of house cats left over = 45 - (38 - x) - (x - 45) = -13 

Since we can't have a negative number of cats left over, this tells us that our formula for y produced a result that was too high, and we had too many cats left over after the sale. Since we can see that some cats must have been re-homed or sold elsewhere after the sale, our final answer is really: 

There were more than 38 + 25 = 63 cats left over at the end of the sale. 

The final answer is: The number of cats left over at the end of the sale is greater than 63.</s>",18,18.0,63.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find the total number of points that Carol scored at the end of the game, we first calculate the number of points she scored in each round.

In the first round, Carol scored 17 points, so we write this as:

17 = Carol's score in the first round

Next, we know that in the second round, Carol scored some number of points (which we will call x) and lost 16 points. So:

x - 16 = Carol's score in the second round

Now we have an equation for Carol's score in the second round, and another equation for her score in the first round. We can combine these two equations to get an equation for all the points she scored in both rounds.

17 = Carol's score in the first round

x - 16 = Carol's score in the second round

To find the total number of points Carol scored at the end of the game, we just need to add up all the points she earned in both rounds. Let's call this total score y.

y = First round score + Second round score

We can substitute in the equations we already found for the scores of the first and second rounds:

y = 17 + (x - 16)

Now we have a new equation that lets us solve for y, the total number of points Carol got at the end of the game.

Simplifying the equation and solving for y, we get:

y = x + 1

So if we know how many points Carol scored in the second round (x), then we can quickly calculate her overall score at the end of the game using this relationship.

Let's say Carol ended up scoring 6 points in the second round. Plugging that value for x into our formula, we can calculate her final score:

y = x + 1

y = 6 + 1

y = 7

So Carol's final score was 7 points at the end of the game. Remember, at the end of the game, Carol's score is equal to the sum of her scores in each round.

{The final answer is: Carol's final score at the end of the game was 7 points.}

When we put it all together, here is the complete step-by-step solution for the problem:

1. Let x be the number of points Carol scored in the second round. So, Carol scored 17 points in the first round, and lost 16 points in the last round. From the second-round result, we get that Carol's first- and second-round scores combined were x - 16 points.

2. Combining the scores from both rounds, we find out that Carol's total score is the sum of the scores from both rounds. Let's call this total score y. The equation to represent this is: y = First-round score + Second-round score.

3. Using the two equations from steps 1 and 2, we set up a system of linear equations to find Carol's total score y. The equations are:

a. First-round score = 17 points

b. Second-round score = x points

c. Total score = y points

d. Equation of first-round score and total score: y = 17 + First-round score

e. Equation of second-round score and total score: y = x - 16

4. To find Carol's total score y, we solve this system of linear equations. We know a and c, and we are looking for b and d. We then substitute the known values of a and c into equation e to get:

y = x - 16

5. We substitute our expression for y from equation d into equation c:

17 + First-round score = x - 16

6. Simplifying the equation and combining like terms, we get:

x - 33 = First-round score

7. Finally, we substitute our expression for First-round score from equation 6 into equation b:

y = 33 + x - 16

8. To find Carol's total score for the game, we find the value of y in our final equation from step 7 above. Let's say Carol scored 6 points in the second round. Plugging that value for x into our final equation from step 7, we get:

y = 33",7,7.0,33.0

First, let's translate the question into mathematical notation. 

Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate, which contain 3 pieces of candy each. He gave 5 of these boxes to his little brother. How many pieces of candy does Dave still have?

This problem can be solved in a few steps:

1. Let's find out how many pieces of candy Dave originally had in his 12 boxes.

12 boxes times 3 pieces per box gives us a total of 36 pieces. {The final answer is: 36 pieces}

2. Now, we know that Dave gave 5 boxes away. Let's find out how many pieces of candy that represents.

5 boxes times 3 pieces per box gives us a total of 15 pieces. {The final answer is: 15 pieces}

3. So, in step 1, we found out that Dave had 36 pieces of candy, and in step 2, we found out that he gave 15 pieces away. Let's adjust our total for the number of pieces he has left.

36 total pieces minus 15 pieces he gave away gives us a new total of 21 pieces. {The final answer is: 21 pieces}

So, we now know that Dave has 21 pieces of candy left.</s>",21,21.0,21.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's represent the number of customers at the restaurant initially (before the lunch rush) as x, the number of customers who left tips as t, and the number of customers who didn't leave tips as n. We also have information about the number of customers during the lunch rush (an extra 12) and the total number of customers after the lunch rush (49).

We can represent this information in equations:

x + 39 = 39 (Initial number of customers equals the original number of waiters)
x + 39 + 12 - n = 49 (Lunch rush adds 12 customers, and n of those didn't leave a tip)

Next, let's identify an equation relating the number of customers who left tips to the total number of tips (which we'll assume is a constant, say a).

t = a * (x + 39 + 12 - n) (Each customer who leaves a tip leaves an amount equal to a)

Now we can substitute the value of n from the second equation into the third equation to get:

t = a * (x + 39 + 12 - (x + 39 + 12 - 49))
t = a * (x - 49)

If we know the total tips left, we can calculate the value of a, and from this, the number of customers who left a tip:

a = t / (x - 49) (Total tips left, divided by the number of customers who didn't leave a tip, equals each tip)

n = x + 39 + 12 - (a / (a + 1)) * (x + 39 + 12) (In the last equation, we're finding the number of customers who didn't leave a tip based on the already calculated value of a)

Now let's put the whole answer together!

{The final answer is} the number of customers who left a tip is equal to t, and the number of customers who didn't leave a tip is equal to n, calculated as:

n = x + 39 + 12 - (a / (a + 1)) * (x + 39 + 12)
a = t / (x - 49)

So, we can use these values and the original variables (x, a, and t) to calculate n and a, which will help us find the number of customers who didn't leave a tip and the average tip left by those who did.</s>",2,2.0,49.0

To solve this problem, we first need to identify the unknown quantities and organize the information given.

Let x be the number of apples the cafe : had, : 50.
Let y be the number of students.
Let z be the number of pies the students received for lunch.
Let w be the number of pies the committee decided to use to make.
Let a be the number of apples needed to make one pie.

The first clause provides us with some given information:

x : 50

The second clause introduces y, indicating that some number of students received lunch. However, we do not know the value of y.

The third and fourth clauses deal with the distribution of apples during lunchtime.

z apples were handed out to the students.
5 apples were handed out to each student, indicating that a total of 5*y apples were used to make lunches.

However, we still do not know the value of z. This is because we do not know the relationship between the number of students (y) and the number of apples handed out for lunch (z).

The final clause provides us with additional information about the remaining apples and how they were used.

w apples were used to make pies.
A pie requires a total of a apples.

Using this information, we can create a set of equations that we can use to find the unknown quantities.

x - 5y - 5*y = w              (1)
z = 5*y                                (2)
x - z - w = 50                           (3)

Let's start with equation (3), which already has our starting value of x (the number of apples) and ends with a known value (50). We use this equation to find the value of z and w.

x - z - w = 50

Solving this equation involves working backward from our known value (50) to our unknowns (x, z, and w).

First, we find x using equation (3).

x = 50 + z + w

Now, we know that the amount of apples remaining (after the cafeteria provided lunch) is equal to x minus the number of apples used during lunch (5*y) and for making pies (w).

x - 5y - w = w

This tells us that the remaining apples (x) minus the number of apples used to provide lunches (5*y) results in the exact same number of apples that were used to make pies (w). This means that w is a key value to finding the number of pies the committee decided to use.

From equation (1), we find w.

x - 5y - 5*y = w

Substituting our knowledge from equation (3), we can rewrite this as:

50 - (z + w) = w

Solving for w:

w = 50 - z

Plugging this value into equation (2), we find z.

z = 5*y

Now that we know the values for z, we can go back to equation (2) and calculate the value for y.

y = z / 5

By definition, y is the number of students who received lunch.

The final answer is:

The number of pies the committee decided to use to make is w = 50 - z.

By equation (1), we find x.

x = 50 + z + (50 - z) = 100

Finally, using equation (2), we find the number of apples given to the students for lunch, z.

z = 5*y

Now, let's find z again using equation (2) and the value of y found from our previous calculation.

z = 5*y = 5*(5*z/5) = 25*z

We can solve for x once again using equation (3).

x = 50 + z + (50 - z) = 100

In our final step, we'll utilize all the information we have to determine how many pies the students could make with the apples they were given.

Let's call the number of pies the students made x/a.

                     Oliver had 33 dollars in January. By March he had spent 4 dollars. If he got another ; 32 ? dollars from his ! mom, how much money would he have? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use a variable to represent the unknown amount that Oliver's mom gave him. Let's call this variable x dollars. Here's how we can reason through this step by step:

1. In January, Oliver had 33 dollars. We can write this as an equation:

   Oliver had 33 dollars in January.

   This equation looks like an assignment where we assign a value to a variable (Oliver) at a specific point in time (January).

        Oliver (O) = 33 (dollars)

2. By March, Oliver had spent a total of 4 dollars. We can subtract this amount from the balance Oliver had in January to find how much he had left.

        Oliver (O) had 33 dollars in January.
        Oliver spent 4 dollars by March.
        Oliver now has O - 4 dollars.

3. Oliver's mom gave him an additional x dollars. We can add this amount to Oliver's current balance (what he had left after spending 4 dollars) to find his new balance.

        Oliver (O) now has O - 4 dollars in March.
        Oliver's mom gave him x dollars in March.
        Oliver now has O - 4 + x dollars.

4. Putting it all together, we can create an equation for the amount of money Oliver had in March.

        Oliver had 33 dollars in January.
        Oliver spent 4 dollars by March.
        Oliver's mom gave him x dollars in March.
        Oliver now has O - 4 + x dollars in March.

    This equation shows how Oliver's balance changed over time due to spending and receiving additional money.

    In equation form:

        O - 4 + x = amount in March (unknown)

5. Finally, let's solve for x, the amount that Oliver's mom gave him in March.

        O - 4 + x = unknown amount in March

        Subtracting O from both sides and then adding 4 to both sides (doing these operations on both sides keeps the equation balanced), we get:

        x = unknown amount in March - O + 4

        Remembering that O is the amount Oliver had in January, and that we want to find x, the amount of the gift from his mom, we can substitute O with 33 and solve for x. This gives us:

        x = unknown amount in March - 33 + 4

        Simplifying this mathematical expression, we get:

        x = unknown amount in March - 29

        Now we know that the difference between the unknown amount in March and 29 dollars is x, the amount Oliver received from his mom. Let's say the unknown amount in March is A. Since we found out that x = A - 29, we can replace the A with this expression and simplify it to solve for x.

        x = (unknown amount in March) - 29

        Let's call this ""the final answer is"" part.
        
        Here's how the whole thing looks. Follow along, doing each step as we go:

        Oliver had 33 dollars in January. By March he had spent 4 dollars. If he got another ; 32 - : 32 x ; dollars from his ! mom, how much money would he have?

        1. Oliver had 33 dollars in January.
            Oliver (O) = 33 (dollars)
        2. Oliver spent 4 dollars by March.
            Oliver (O) had 33 dollars in January.
            Oliver spent 4 dollars by March.
            Oliver now has O - 4 dollars.
        3. Oliver's mom gave him an additional x dollars.
            Oliver (O) now has O - 4 dollars in March.
            Oliver's mom gave him x dollars in March.
            Oliver now has O - 4 + x dollars.

To solve this problem, we can represent the initial number of apples as n, the number of apples used to make lunch for the students as x, and the additional number of apples bought as y.

Given that the school cafeteria had 14 apples in total, we can set up an equation to represent this:

n = 14

Next, we know that 13 of these apples were used to make lunch for the students. Let's represent this as:

x = 13

So, we can substitute this value for x in our initial equation to find n:

n = 14

n - x = 14 - 13

n - 13 = 1

n = 20

Now, we also know that after buying an additional 49 apples, the cafeteria had a total of n apples. Let's represent this as:

n + 49 = n + x + 49

By substituting our previous equations for n and x, we can find the final value for n:

14 + 49 = 14 - 13 + x + 49

63 = -13 + x + 63

0 = 46 - x

x = -46

However, since we cannot have a negative number of apples, we know that x (the number of apples used for lunch) cannot be a negative value. This means that our initial equation for the number of apples used for lunch, x = 13, must be correct.

Since we know that x = 13 and we also know that the cafeteria started with 14 apples and bought an additional 49, we can substitute these values into our final equation to find the total number of apples at the end:

n + 49 = 14 - 13 + 14 + 49

n = 28

The final answer is n = 28. So, after buying additional apples, the school cafeteria now has a total of 28 apples.

To summarize the steps, we first set up an equation to represent the initial number of apples, then found the number that was used for lunch and substituted that value into the original equation to find the total number of apples. We then found the additional number of apples that were bought, replaced the value in our original equation, and solved for the final number of apples.</s>",50,50.0,28.0

To find Frank's final score, we need to calculate the number of points he earned in both halves and then add them together.

In the first half, Frank answered 3 out of 3 questions, which means he earned 9 points (3 points per question). In the second half, Frank answered 2 out of 4 questions correctly, earning him 6 points (3 points per question for the correct answers and no points for the two incorrect answers).

Adding up his scores from both halves, Frank's total score is 15 points. So, {The final answer is: Frank's final score is 15 points}.</s>",15,15.0,15.0

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the unknown quantities with variables. As Zoe found 8 boxes of clothing, and each box contained 4 scarves and 6 mittens, we can write:

x boxes of clothing

each box has:
- 4 scarves: 4x boxes of scarves
- 6 mittens: 6x boxes of mittens

Now let's calculate the total number of scarves and mittens that Zoe found:

total number of scarves = 4x boxes of scarves

total number of mittens = 6x boxes of mittens

We can also find the total number of pieces of winter clothing that Zoe has. This includes both scarves and mittens:

total number of pieces of winter clothing = total number of scarves + total number of mittens

Let's calculate that:

total number of pieces of winter clothing = 4x boxes of scarves + 6x boxes of mittens

Now we have enough information to find the total number of pieces of winter clothing that Zoe has after unboxing all 8 boxes:

total number of pieces of winter clothing = x(4+6) = 4x + 6x = 10x pieces

So for the total number of pieces of winter clothing that Zoe has, we can write:

the final answer is: 10x pieces.

Using the given information, we can find x and substitute it into our formula for the total number of pieces of winter clothing. Here's how to do the whole process:

1. We know that Zoe found 8 boxes of winter clothing. So:

x = 8

2. Now let's calculate the total number of scarves she found:

total number of scarves = 4x = 4(8) = 32 scarves

3. We also want to calculate the total number of mittens she found:

total number of mittens = 6x = 6(8) = 48 mittens

4. Now we have enough information to calculate the total number of pieces of winter clothing that Zoe has:

total number of pieces of winter clothing = x(4+6) = 10x = 10(8) = 80 pieces

5. Putting all of our answers together, we now know:

- Zoe found 32 scarves.
- Zoe found 48 mittens.
- Zoe has a total of 80 pieces of winter clothing (scarves and mittens). 

The final answer is: 80 pieces of winter clothing.</s>",80,80.0,80.0

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the variables:
   - Frank: the number of trick decks bought by Frank
   - Friend: the number of trick decks bought by Frank's friend
   - Each: the cost of each trick deck (seven dollars)
   - Total: the total amount spent by Frank and his friend

2. Set up equations:
   - Frank's total cost = Number of decks Frank bought × Cost per deck
      Frank's total cost = Frank × Each

   - Friend's total cost = Number of decks Friend bought × Cost per deck
      Friend's total cost = Friend × Each

   - Total cost = Frank's total cost + Friend's total cost
      Total = Frank + Friend × Each

3. Substitute the values:
   - Frank bought 3 decks, so Frank = 3
   - Friend bought 2 decks, so Friend = 2

   - Using the first equation, Frank's total cost is:
       Frank's total cost = 3 × $7
       Frank's total cost = $21

   - Using the second equation, Friend's total cost is:
       Friend's total cost = 2 × $7
       Friend's total cost = $14

4. Put it all together:
   - Using the third equation, the total amount spent by Frank and his friend is:
       Total = Frank + Friend × Each
       Total = $21 + $14
       Total = $35

5. Final answer:
   - {The final answer is}: $35

To summarize the solution, Frank spent $21 on three trick decks, and his friend spent $14 on two trick decks, for a total cost of $35 for both of them.</s>",35,35.0,35.0

                    question:
                     Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts , before school. If : he : had ? only , washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations using the known information. Let x be the number of short sleeve shirts Sam did not wash, and y be the number of long sleeve shirts Sam did not wash. We can represent the number of shirts Sam washed by the expressions 40 - x and 23 - y for the short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts, respectively. Using this notation, we can write the conditions that the number of shirts Sam washed is equal to the total number of shirts he had to wash:

(40 - x) + (23 - y) = 40 (short sleeve shirts)
(40 - x) + (23 - y) = 23 (long sleeve shirts)

To simplify the equations, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate the y variable:

(40 - x) - (23 - y) = 40 - 23 (subtracting the second equation from the first)
x - y = 17 (simplifying the expression)

Next, we can use the given information to create a new equation. We know that Sam had washed 29 short sleeve shirts by the time school started. So, we can represent the number of short sleeve shirts Sam did not wash as:

x = 40 - 29

Substituting this in our first equation gives:

(40 - 29) + (23 - y) = 40
y = 47 - x (simplifying the expression)

To find x, we can substitute y in terms of x in our second equation (which we derived earlier):

x - x = 17 (simplifying the expression, since y is already expressed in terms of x)

This simplification will give us a trivial result:

0 = 0 (simplifying the expression)

This equation shows us that the expression x - x is equal to 0, which is logical. However, we can't determine the exact value of x, since it will always be equal to itself. Instead, we can substitute x in terms of y in the expression of y:

y = 47 - (40 - 29)
y = 38 (simplifying the expression)

So, the number of short sleeve shirts Sam did not wash is x = 40 - 29 = 11, and the number of long sleeve shirts Sam did not wash is y = 38.

Therefore, {The number of short sleeve shirts Sam did not wash is 11, and the number of long sleeve shirts Sam did not wash is 38}.</s>",34,34.0,38.0

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of customers the waiter had at the beginning as x.

After 41 customers left, there were (x - 41) customers remaining.

When 20 more customers arrived, the total number of customers was (x - 41) + 20, which is equal to the number of customers at the end.

So, after the 20 new customers arrived, the waiter had (x - 41) + 20 = x - 21 customers remaining.

To find the final number of customers, we can use the fact that the waiter had a total of 47 customers at the beginning and end.

47 = x - 21 + 41

Combining like terms, we get:

47 = x + 20

To solve for x, let's subtract 20 from both sides:

47 - 20 = x

27 = x

Thus, the waiter had 27 customers at the beginning. {The final answer is: 27}</s>",26,26.0,27.0
