                    question:
                     Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Step 1: Paige had 11 songs on her MP3 player. (Original number of songs)

Step 2: Paige deleted 9 old songs from her MP3 player. (Lost 9 songs)

Step 3: Let the number of new songs be x. (New song addition)

Step 4: Paige now has (Original number of songs - Lost songs) + New song addition songs.

Substituting values, we get:
1) 11 - 9 = 2 songs remaining after deleting old songs.
2) Let x = 8 songs added.
3) After adding new songs, Paige has (2 songs + 8 songs) = 10 songs.

Therefore, the final answer is: {Paige now has 10 songs on her MP3 player after deleting 9 old songs and adding 8 new songs.}</s>",10
" There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut? ","<|user|>

                    question:
                     There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Let's first find the total number of students who tried out: 39 girls and 4 boys. So, the total number of students trying out is:

   Total = 39 girls + 4 boys
   Total = 43 students

2. Now the number of students who got called back is 26. Let's call this number 'x'. Out of the called back students, we know that there were '4' boys. So, the number of girls who got called back is (x - 4).

   x = 26 students

   Boys called back = 4

   Girls called back = (x - 4) girls

3. Now we have to find the number of students who didn't get called back. This amount is the same as total students - students called back.  We'll create an algebraic equation that combines this information.

   Total students = Students called back + Students who didn't get called back

   Total = x students + (Total - x) students

4. Comparing this with the total students we calculated in step 1, we can simplify the equation:

   x = 26 students

   x + (43 - x) = 43 students

   Simplifying:

   43 = 2x

   x = 21.5 students (not possible as it's not an integer)

   So, let's round down to 21 students

5. Using what we found in step 3, we can find the number of students who didn't get called back:

   (Total - x) students = Students who didn't get called back

   (43 - 21) students = Students who didn't get called back

   Students who didn't get called back = 22 students

6. Adding the students who got called back to the students who didn't get called back, we can find the total number of students who tried out:

   Students who got called back + Students who didn't get called back = Total number of students (43)

   (21 + 22) students = 43 students

   Final answer is: 21 students got called back, and 22 students didn't make the cut. The total number of students trying out was 43.

   {The final answer is: 21 students got called back, and 22 students didn't make the cut. The total number of students trying out was 43.}</s>",17

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find the number of coloring books Faye has after giving away 3 and buying 48, we can use the formula for combining two events: adding and subtracting.

First, let's calculate the number of coloring books Faye has after giving away 3. Since we're subtracting 3, this is known as the ""loss"" term. We'll subtract from the original total.

Number of coloring books before giving away 3: 34
Number of coloring books lost: 3

Number of coloring books left after giving away 3: 34 - 3 = 31

Next, we'll add the number of coloring books Faye bought, which is represented by the ""gain"" term.

New number of coloring books after buying 48: 31 + 48 = 79

So now Faye has a total of 79 coloring books.

Final answer: {The final answer is 79 coloring books.}</s>",79
" The school cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch for the students and then bought 6 more, how many apples would they have? ","<|user|>

                     The school cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch for the students and then bought 6 more, how many apples would they have? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of apples the school cafeteria had initially by x.

After making lunches for 20 students, the school cafeteria was left with (x - 20) apples.

Next, the school cafeteria bought 6 more apples. Let's represent this by (x - 20) + 6.

So, in total, they will have (x - 20) + 6 apples.

Let's equate this to the initial number of apples x.

(x - 20) + 6 = x

Distributing the (-20) and collecting like terms, we get:

-14 = -x

Since we know that x can't be negative as it represents the total number of apples, we know -x is equivalent to x (x can't be negative and -14 is negative).

So, re-arranging the equation to get x, we have:

-x = -14

x = 14

The final answer is:

The school cafeteria has 14 apples. 

To Summarise:
- Initially, the school cafeteria had x apples.
- The school used 20 apples to make lunch for the students, leaving them with (x - 20) apples.
- The school bought 6 more apples, which when combined with the original ones gave us a total of (x - 20) + 6.
- The equation (x - 20) + 6 = x was used to find the value of x.
- The solution to this equation was x = 14.
- Hence, the school currently has 14 apples in total.</s>",9

<|assistant|>
To find the number of points earned from defeating enemies in a video game, we know that each enemy defeated earns us 9 points. Let x represent the number of enemies defeated. Thus, our points earned from defeating enemies can be found by the formula:

x * 9 = points earned

First, let's find the total number of enemies defeated. The problem states that we destroy all but 3 enemies, which means we are left with 3 enemies. Therefore, the number of enemies defeated is equal to the total number of enemies minus the number of remaining enemies, or:

total enemies defeated = 11 - 3

total enemies defeated = 8

Next, we substitute 8 for x in our formula for calculating points earned:

8 * 9 = points earned

points earned = 72

                     Megan earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 14 bags, but didn't recycle 5 of them, how many points would she have earned? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Step 1: Determine the number of bags Megan actually recycled.

Megan didn't recycle 5 bags, so the number of bags she recycled is equivalent to the number of bags she had in total, minus 5.

Number of bags recycled = 14 bags - 5 bags = 9 bags

Step 2: Find the number of points Megan earned from recycling.

The number of points Megan earned is equal to the number of bags she recycled, multiplied by the number of points she earned per bag.

Points earned from recycling = 9 bags × 8 points per bag = 72 points

Step 3: Calculate the total number of points Megan earned.

The total number of points Megan earned is the sum of the points she earned from recycling and any additional points she may have earned from unrecorded sources.

Total points earned = points earned from recycling + any additional points earned

Final answer:

Megan earned a total of 72 points from recycling, but she also earned some additional points from unrecorded sources. Let's say she earned an additional 24 points for other activities, such as volunteering at a recycling event or participating in a recycling challenge.

Therefore, Megan's total number of points earned is:

Total points earned = 72 points from recycling + 24 points from other sources = 96 points

The final answer is: Megan earned a total of 96 points.</s>",72

<|assistant|>
To find how much money April earned from selling her discounted flowers, we can follow these steps:

1. April started with 13 roses, and each rose was sold for $4 during the sale. Therefore, April received $52 (13 roses multiplied by $4 each) for the roses she initially had. (The formula for calculating the total cost or price of an object or service based on the number and cost per item or unit is total cost/price = number of items multiplied by cost per item.)

2. After the initial sale, April had 4 roses left. She sold each of these roses for $4, earning an additional $16 ($4 for each of the 4 remaining roses).

3. Adding the amounts from the first and second steps, April earned a total of $68 ($52 earned from the initial 13 roses, plus $16 earned from the remaining 4 roses) during the sale.

" Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? ","<|user|>

                    question:
                     Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, let's find how many short sleeve shirts Ned had not washed by the time school started. Since he had already washed 9 short sleeve shirts, and he had not washed them all, some must still be left. Let x be the number of short sleeve shirts that Ned had not washed.

   At the time school started, the total number of short sleeve shirts that Ned had washed was 9, and the number that he had not washed was x. So, the total number of short sleeve shirts that Ned had at the beginning was 9 plus x, or 9 + x.

   We also know that the total number of short sleeve shirts that Ned had at the beginning, minus the number that he had not washed, equals the number that he had already washed. That is, (9 + x) - x = 9. Solving for x, we get

   x = (9 + x) - 9

   Expanding and simplifying this expression, we get

   x = x

   Equating this value to the formula x = y - z (where y is the total number of items, and z is the number already accounted for), we get

   x = 9 - 0 (since he had not yet washed any long sleeve shirts at this time)

   Thus, x equals the total number of short sleeve shirts that Ned had not washed, which we can call y. Using this value, we get

   y = 9

   y is the total number of short sleeve shirts, while z represents the number that he had already washed at this time, which is 0.

2. Next, we will find how many long sleeve shirts Ned had not washed by the time school started. Let l be the number of long sleeve shirts that Ned had not washed.

   After Ned had washed a total of 29 shirts, he still had (21 - 21 + l) = l long sleeve shirts left to wash. Since Ned had school soon, he did not finish washing, leaving it to later. We can find the total number of long sleeve shirts that Ned had when school started by adding the number that he had already washed, which is 29, and the number that he still needed to wash, which is l.

   Therefore, the total number of long sleeve shirts that Ned had when school started can be written as 29 + l. This is equal to the total number of long sleeve shirts that Ned had when school started minus the number that he had already counted as wearing and having washed, which is 0.

   Setting this expression equal to the formula that y represents, in which y is the total number of items, and z represents the number already accounted for, we obtain

   z = 29

   y is the total number of long sleeve shirts, while z represents the number that he had already washed at this time.

3. Using the information obtained in steps 1 and 2, we can find the total number of shirts that Ned had at the beginning by adding the number of short sleeve shirts that he had not yet washed, which is y, and the number of long sleeve shirts that he had not yet washed, which is z.

   Therefore, the total number of shirts, y, equals the number that he had not washed of either kind, which is y + z. Solving for y, we get

   y = y + z

   Expanding and simplifying this expression, we get

   y = z

   y is the number of the items that have not yet been washed, while z represents the number already accounted for. Using this value, we get

   y = 29

   y represents the number of long sleeve shirts that he had not yet washed. Therefore, the total number of shirts that Ned had at the beginning, which we can call y, was

   y = 9 + 29 (since he had already washed 9 short sleeve shirts)

4. We need to find how many shirts Ned had not washed, period. This is the number that he did not finish washing before school started. Let x be the number of short sleeve shirts that he had not finished washing, and l be the number of long sleeve shirts that he had not finished washing.

   The total number of shirts that Ned had when school started was y, which we already calculated in step 3",1

                     A company invited 47 people to a luncheon, but 7 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 5 people each, how many tables do they need? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To determine how many tables are needed for the remaining guests, we first calculate the number of guests who did show up. If 47 people were invited and 7 of them didn't show up, then the number of guests who did show up is 47 - 7, which is 40.

Next, we need to find out how many people each table can hold. We are given that each table can hold 5 people. This means that for every table, there will be 5 guests seated at it.

Now, we can set up a ratio to find out the number of tables needed. The ratio is the number of guests divided by the number of people that each table can hold. There are 40 guests and each table can hold 5 people, so we have:

40 guests ÷ 5 guests per table = 8 tables

Therefore, if the remaining guests each hold a table for five people, they will need a total of 8 tables.

{The final answer is 8 tables.}</s>",8

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Step 1: Tom had 5 books initially. {The initial number of books Tom had is 5.}

Step 2: Tom sold 4 of these books. Let's call the number of books Tom sold x. Therefore, x = 4.

Step 3: Tom earned some money by selling these books. Let's call this amount of money y. We can set up an equation to find out the value of y since we know the number of books Tom sold. Tom earned y dollars for selling x=4 books. Therefore,

y = 4 * price of each book {Here, ""price of each book"" is a constant, which is not changing here. Later on, when we know the price of each book, we can calculate the exact value of y.}

Step 4: Tom used this earned money to buy 38 new books. Let'z call the price of each new book z. Therefore,

38z = y {Here, we set up an equation with 38 as the number of new books and y as the money Tom earned by selling 4 old books. In the end, we'll know the value of y using this equation.}

Step 5: Now let's combine steps 3 and 4 to make only one equation that contains both x and z variables.

4 * price of each book = 38z

Step 6: We want to find out the number of books Tom has now, so let's add the number of books he had initially (5) to the number of new books he bought (38).

Total number of books = 5 + 38 {Here, 5 is the initial number of books Tom had, and 38 is the number of new books he bought}

Step 7: Now, let's solve step 6's equation.

Total number of books = 5 + 38

Total number of books = 43 {Here, we have added the initial number of books to the new books that Tom bought}

Step 8: Finally, let's go back to step 5, and using the initial value of y, let's find out the value of z (price of each new book).

38 * z = 4 * price of each old book

z = (\(\frac{4}{38}\)) * price of each old book {Here, we first calculate the per book price of each new book from y, which we already know from step 3 since y is a function of how many old books Tom sold, and then we take the price for each new book from the equation above.}

Step 9: Now, let's go back to step 4, substitute the newly calculated value of z from step 8, and find out the exact value of y (money earned by selling x=4 old books).

y = 4 * price of each old book

y = 4 * (\(\frac{38}{z}\)) * z {Here, we use z's newly calculated value from step 8 to replace each occurrence of z in step 4}

Step 10: Let's put all the information we've found by now back into step 3, and calculate the exact price of each old book.

price of each old book = \(\frac{y}{4}\) {Here, y is the exact value of money earned by selling 4 old books that we deduced in step 9. And we divide it by 4, since each old book sold for a 1/4 share of this money earned.}

Step 11: Now, let's go back to step 1, and calculate the total number of books Tom has, using all the information we've deduced at step 8 and step 10.

Total number of books = 5 + 38

Total number of books = 43 {By adding the initial number of books to the number of new books that Tom bought.}

Total number of books = 43 {Here, we now have the final number of books that Tom has after selling all the 4 old books and then buying 38 new books, using the income that he made by selling the 4 old books.}

{The final answer is: Tom has a total of 43 books now, which is the initial number of books, 5, along with the 38 new books that Tom bought with the money he made by selling his old books.}</s>",39

                    question:
                     For a birthday party Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 9 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many regular sodas and diet sodas Jerry can fit on each shelf since we know his fridge can fit a total of 9 sodas on each shelf.

Firstly, let's find the number of regular sodas Jerry can fit on each shelf. Jerry bought a total of 41 regular sodas, and we need to divide this by the number of shelves that can fit regular sodas. If we assume that each shelf fits the same number of regular sodas as diet sodas, then the number of regular sodas that can fit on each shelf is:

41 regular sodas ÷ (number of shelves with regular sodas)

We can calculate the number of shelves with regular sodas by finding how many regular sodas out of the total of 41 he’s used up. Let's name this number “x”.

x regular sodas = 41 regular sodas (using the fact that Jerry's bought 41 regular sodas in total)
x diet sodas = 0 (since Jerry hasn't bought any diet sodas yet)

Adding up the number of regular sodas and diet sodas on each shelf gives us:

x + 22 = 9 (the total number of sodas that can fit on each shelf)

Substituting the first equation into this gives us:

41 - x + 0 = 9

So:

9 - x = 0 (equivalent to setting the second equation to 0)

9 = x (which is what we want).

Now, we know that he can fit 9 sodas on each shelf, so we can calculate the number of regular sodas that can fit on each shelf by finding 9 multiplied by the number of regular sodas that can fit on each shelf.

So, the number of regular sodas he can fit on each shelf is:

9 * (number of regular sodas that can fit on each shelf)

We also know that the same number of regular sodas and diet sodas can fit on each shelf, so we can use this to find the number of diet sodas that can fit on each shelf as well:

9 * (number of diet sodas that can fit on each shelf) = 22 (the number of diet sodas he's bought so far)

Let's name the number of diet sodas that can fit on each shelf ""y"". So:

9 * y = 22

Dividing both sides by 9 gives us:

y = 22/9 (the number of diet sodas that can fit on each shelf).

Now we're in a position to find out how many shelves he'll fill up with both regular and diet sodas by finding the total number of sodas that his fridge can hold (in terms of shelves) and comparing it to the total number of sodas that Jerry has. The total number of sodas that Jerry's fridge can hold is the number of shelves it can hold multiplied by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

So, the total number of sodas that Jerry's fridge can hold is:

(number of shelves it can hold) * (number of regular sodas that can fit on each shelf) * (number of diet sodas that can fit on each shelf)

Let's find the number of regular sodas that Jerry has:

x = 41 (the number of regular sodas he's bought so far)

The number of regular sodas that Jerry has is the same as the number of regular sodas that he can fit on the shelves that have regular sodas plus the number of regular sodas that can fit on the shelves with both regular and diet sodas. So:

x = (number of shelves with regular sodas) * (number of regular sodas that can fit on each shelf) + (number of shelves with both regular and diet sodas) * (number of regular sodas that can fit on each shelf when both regular and diet sodas are being considered)

We’ve already identified that Jerry can fit 9 sodas on each shelf, and we’re going to assume that the shelves he uses for both diet and regular sodas can be identified by adding their quantities (which is what we’re doing below), so we can identify how many of these shelves he’s used up. The number of shelves Jerry has filled up are:

<|assistant|
First, we have the amount of candy Debby and her sister had before they ate 35 pieces on the first night. Debby had 32 pieces and her sister had 42 pieces, for a total of 74 pieces.

Second, we know that they ate a total of 35 pieces on the first night. Debby contributed some of her 32 pieces and her sister contributed some of her 42 pieces to the total of 35 pieces eaten. Let's call the number of pieces Debby ate on the first night x. We can use a system of equations to determine how many pieces her sister ate on the first night.

Equation for Debby's pieces: 32 - x = Unknown amount of candy Debby has after the first night
Equation for Debby's sister's pieces: 42 - (35 - x) = Unknown amount of candy Debby's sister has after the first night

Next, we can solve the system of equations to find the value of x, which represents the number of pieces Debby ate on the first night, and also determine how many pieces are left after the first night.

We can use subtraction to set up our equations. Let's do that for Debby's equation first:

32 - x = Unknown amount of candy Debby has after the first night

To solve for x, we can use addition to transform this equation into an equation for x:

32 + (-x) = Unknown amount of candy Debby has after the first night + (-x)

Next, we can simplify by combining the x terms:

32 = Unknown amount of candy Debby has after the first night - x

Now, we can solve for x using algebraic techniques. Let's subtract 32 from both sides:

0 = Unknown amount of candy Debby has after the first night - (35 - x) - 32

Next, we can use addition to distribute the negative sign and group like terms:

0 = -(x - 32 - 35)

Finally, we can use algebraic techniques to solve for x:

x = 32 + 35

Therefore, Debby ate 67 pieces on the first night. We can use this information to find how many pieces are left. Using Debby's equation, we can set it up to find the unknown amount of candy Debby has after the first night:

32 - 67 = x'

Similarly, we can do this for Debby's sister's equation:

42 - (35 - 67) = y'

Therefore, Debby has 30 pieces and her sister has 57 pieces left after the first night. The total number of pieces left after the first night is the sum of Debby's and her sister's leftover pieces:

30 + 57 = 87 pieces

Thus, we have found that there are 87 pieces left after they ate 35 pieces on the first night.

The final answer is: Debby and her sister have 87 pieces of candy left after eating 35 pieces on Halloween.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. Emily started with a total of 41 seeds. (41 seeds in hand)

2. She planted 29 seeds in the big garden. (41 - 29 = 12 seeds left)

3. Let's call the number of small gardens x. Emily placed 4 seeds in each of the small gardens, so she planted a total of 4 * x seeds in the small gardens. (4x seeds in the small gardens)

4. Since Emily used up all of her seeds, we know that the total number of seeds she planted (big garden and small gardens) is equal to the number of seeds she started with. So, we can set up an equation:

41 seeds = 29 big seeds + 4x small seeds

5. Now, let's solve for x:

 x = (4x small seeds) / 4

 x = 10 * (small seeds in each small garden)

 x = (41 - 29) / 10

 x = 12 / 10

 x is a fraction, so it needs to be a whole number of gardens. Since 12 seeds are left over, we either need to round down to the nearest whole number or add some remaining seeds in a bigger size to the big garden.

Let's assume that Emily decided to add the remaining 12 seeds to the big garden.

6. Since we added the remaining 12 seeds to the big garden, Emily now planted a total of 41 + 12 = 53 seeds.

7. Emily still has some seeds leftover (if each small garden has 4 remaining seeds, we would expect to have 4x seeds remaining). To make the math easier, let's assume that there are none left over.

8. Now, let's calculate how many small gardens she really has. Since she placed 4 seeds in each garden, she placed a total of 4 * x seeds in the small gardens. Since we added all the remaining seeds to the big garden instead, the total number of seeds she planted is now equal to the number of seeds she started with. Let's set up an equation:

53 seeds = 29 big seeds + 4x small seeds

9. Now, let's find out how many small gardens (x) she has:

x = (53 - 29) / 4

x = 14

10. Therefore, Emily has 14 small gardens.

The final answer is: Emily has 14 small gardens.

This solution can be verified by counting the number of seeds Emily planted in total (53) and noting that it's equal to the number of seeds she started with (41). We know this because in step 8 we found that there are no remaining seeds in the small gardens.</s>",3

                </s> 
<|assistant|
Firstly, let's calculate how many pieces of candy Emily has in total. When she received candy from neighbors, she got 5 pieces. When she received candy from her older sister, she got 13 pieces. Therefore, Emily's total number of candy pieces is 5 + 13 = 18 pieces.

Next, let's calculate how many days it will take for Emily to finish all her candy if she eats 9 pieces a day. We can use a formula for finding the number of days (x) when a certain number of items are being consumed at a fixed rate:

Items consumed per day = Number of remaining items / Number of days it takes to consume 

Let's translate this formula for Emily's case. The number of remaining items is the total number of candle pieces that Emily has, which is 18. The number of items being consumed per day is 9. The number of days it takes to consume is x. Substitute these variables in our formula:

9 = 18 / x

If we split this equation by 9 and x, we get:

1 = 2 / x

x = 2

Therefore, Emily will finish all her candy in 2 days.

In summary, Emily's candy will last her for 2 days. Once she finishes eating all the pieces, there will be 0 left.

{The final answer is 2 days.}

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find the number of shelves Mike will need, we need to calculate how many books will be left for him to put away after the librarian takes 10 of them.

Let's say there are x books left for Mike to put away. The total number of books left is x - 10.

We know that there are 82 books in total, so we can set up an equation:

82 = x - 10

To solve for x, we add 10 to both sides:

92 = x

So, x is 92.

Now we can find how many shelves Mike will need. If each shelf can hold 9 books, we can divide the number of remaining books by 9 to find out how many shelves will be needed:

10 = x / 9

We can divide both sides by 10 to solve for x:

1 = x / (90)

Multiplying both sides by 90, we get:

90 = x

So, x is 90.

Therefore, Mike needs 10 shelves to put away the remaining 90 books.

{The final answer is: Mike will need 10 shelves to put away the remaining books after the librarian takes 10 of them.}</s>",8

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of pictures Nancy took at the zoo as x and the number of pictures she took at the museum as y.

Originally, we know that x + y = 49 for the pictures taken at the zoo and that y = 8 for the pictures taken at the museum.

After deleting 38 pictures, the total number of pictures Nancy has left is:

(x - 38) + (y - 38) = 49 - 38

Solving for x and y in the new system of equations:

x - 38 = 49 - 38 (First equation)
y - 38 = 8 - 38 (Second equation)

To simplify, let's add 38 to both equations:

x = 49
y = 0

We can see from the second equation that after deleting some pictures, Nancy didn't take any pictures at the museum. The first equation then tells us that she has 49 pictures remaining, which include all the pictures she took at the zoo.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for finding the time taken to complete a job if the rate at which the job is done is constant:

time taken = total work left / (rate of work)

Let's first calculate the total number of windows left to be installed:

total windows = 14 (given)
windows installed = 8 (given)
windows left = 14 - 8 = 6

Next, let's find the rate of installation (the number of windows installed per hour):

rate of installation = 1 window/8 hours = 1/8 windows/hour

Now we can find the time taken to install the remaining 6 windows:

time taken = total work left / (rate of work)
           = (6 windows) / (1/8 windows/hour)
           = 48 hours

So the builder will take 48 hours, or 6 days (assuming 8 hours in a working day), to install the remaining windows.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The builder will take 6 days to install the remaining windows.}</s>",48

Step 1: Determine the number of oranges in the bin initially (before throwing away old oranges). Let's call this x.

x = 40

Step 2: Find the number of old oranges thrown away. Let's call this y.

y = 25

Step 3: Calculate the new number of oranges in the bin after throwing away the old ones. This is the original number of oranges left in the bin (x - y), plus the new oranges added (21).

Let's call this z.

z = (x - y) + 21

Step 4: Substitute the values from step 1 and step 2 into step 3 to find the final number of oranges in the bin.

z = (40 - 25) + 21

z = 19

Step 5: Check the answer. Does it make sense? If it doesn't, backtrack and check your math.

{The final answer is} 19

The store now has 19 oranges in the bin.

Alternatively, we can simplify the problem by realizing that we can find the final number of oranges in the bin by simply adding the number thrown away and the new number added:

Final oranges = Old oranges - Old oranges thrown away + New oranges added

Final oranges = 40 - 25 + 21

Final oranges = 19

<|assistant|>
Let's denote the amount tips left by each customer by x. Then, we have 5 customers who didn't leave a tip and 2 customers who left a tip. 

The total amount earned from tips is:

(2 customers * x) + (5 customers * 0) = x (as the customer who left a tip left behind an amount that we'll call x, and one who didn't leave any tip left nothing behind)

Since each customer paid $3 for the meal, we can calculate the total expense for meals as:

7 customers * $3 = $21 (all customers paid the same price for the meals)

The total amount earned was:

2 customers * $3 + x + (5 customers) * $3 = $10 + x

So the total amount of money earned is the sum of money from meals and tips, which is:

$21 + $10 + x = ?

(As we only know that in total, 5 customers didn't leave a tip, we can't find the exact amount x was, but we know that all tips together add up to $5, and we can find a possible range for x. The value $x = 0 means that no tip was paid, and $x = 5$ means that the tips together make up exactly $5. Since each customer left a tip between the two extreme cases, $x$ should take on values between $0$ and $5$.)

{The final answer is} $76 + x$, where $x \in [0, 5]$ dollars. The exact amount of tips can't be determined from the given information, making it an unknown part of the overall earnings. However, we can find the total amount earned with certainty.</s>",6

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pieces of candy that Faye has now (after her sister gave her 40 more pieces). We can find this by adding the number of pieces Faye had already (after eating 25) and the number of pieces her sister gave her (40).

First, we need to find how many pieces of candy Faye had after eating 25. This is the number of pieces she started with, which was 47, minus the number of pieces she ate, which was 25.

Faye started with 47 pieces, and ate 25 of them, so she had 22 pieces left the first night:

47 pieces - 25 pieces eaten = 22 pieces left

Next, we add the 40 pieces her sister gave her to the number of pieces Faye had left from the first night. This tells us how many pieces of candy she has now:

22 pieces left from the first night + 40 pieces given by her sister = total number of pieces now

The total number of pieces Faye has now is:

Step 2: Divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends to find the number of chicken wings consumed by each friend.

Since there are 4 friends in the group, each friend consumed (16 ÷ 4) = 4 chicken wings.

Step 3: Verify the solution.

If each friend consumed 4 chicken wings, and the restaurant cooked a total of 16 chicken wings, it follows that each friend should have received 4 chicken wings. We can confirm this by checking that the number of chicken wings consumed by the group (16) is equal to the number of chicken wings received by the group (4 x 4 = 16).

The final answer is 4 chicken wings.

Thus, each friend consumed and received 4 chicken wings. {The final answer is 4 chicken wings.}</s>",4

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for finding the number of days it takes to sell a certain number of items at a specified rate:

Number of days = Total number of items / Number of items sold per day

Let's call the initial number of puppies at the shelter P1 and the additional number of puppies brought in P2. In terms of units, we can represent this:

Number of puppies (P) = P1 + P2

Now, we know the number of puppies being adopted per day is 8 (A), and from the initial number of pets and the number adopted daily, we can find the total number of puppies adopted (Adopted):

Adoption = A x Number of days

There are two sets of puppies at the shelter, so we need to consider both:

Total number of puppies adopted = Adopted (P1) + Adopted (P2)

Setting both formulas equal to each other and simplifying, we get:

P1 + P2 = A x Number of days + Adopted (P1) + Adopted (P2)

We want to find ""Number of days,"" so let's isolate that variable:

Number of days = (P1 + P2 - Adopted (P1) - Adopted (P2)) / A

Substituting the initial values for P1, A, and P2 gives us:

Number of days = (5 - (8 x Number of days)) / 8 + (35 - (8 x Number of days)) / 8

Now we have an equation involving only ""Number of days,"" and we can solve it using an iterative solver or algebraic methods. However, we can analyze how the solution would change based on the values of ""Number of days"" to help identify an approximate value.

If no puppies are adopted on the first day (Number of days = 0), then there are still fifty puppies left at the shelter, and eight get adopted every day. It would take six and a quarter days (0 + 6.25) for the shelter to be cleared of these initial puppies (25 / 8 = 3.125 days, but we round up to the next quarter-day value for simplicity).

However, when the additional batch of thirty-five puppies comes in, that would leave eighty (5 + 35) puppies to be sold, requiring an extra 12.5 days for adoption (80 / 8 = 10 days).

So the total number of days required would be sixteen and a quarter days (6.25 + 12.50).

Now let's look at what happens if all the puppies from both batches are adopted immediately. In that case, there are forty (8) puppies being adopted daily from the initial batch, along with eight puppies being adopted daily from the additional batch (8 + 8 = 16).

That would take precisely 5 days to clear out the initial batch (40 / 8 = 5.00) and another four days to clear out the second batch (35 / 8 = 4.38, but we round up to five quarters for simplicity).

Adding those numbers together, we see that all the puppies will be adopted after precisely nine days, which is our final answer:

Number of days = 9 {The final answer is}.

We can see that adopting all the puppies at once would be best for reducing the length of time it takes to clear the shelter.</s>",5

<|assistant|>
To find how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows, we need to first calculate how many windows are still left to be installed.

Remaining windows = Total windows - Installed windows
             = 9 - 6
             = 3

Now we know that it takes 6 hours to install one window. As there are 3 windows left, we need to find out how long it would take to install all 3 windows.

Time to install 3 windows = Number of hours needed to install one window × Number of windows
           = 6 hours × 3 windows
           = 18 hours

Therefore, it will take the builder 18 hours to install the remaining windows, and the total time needed to install all the windows in the new building would be the sum of the time needed to install the first 6 windows and the remaining 3 windows.

Total time taken = Time taken to install first 6 windows + Time taken to install remaining 3 windows
                 = 6 hours × 6 windows + 18 hours

                    question:
                     While playing at the arcade, Frank won 33 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 9 tickets playing 'skee ball'. If he was trying to buy candy that cost 6 tickets a piece, how many could he buy? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find out how many candies Frank could buy with the tickets he has, we need to know how many tickets one candy costs and how many tickets Frank has in total.

Frank won a total of 42 tickets from playing 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball'. He won 33 tickets from playing 'whack a mole' and 9 tickets from playing 'skee ball'. So, we can find how many tickets each game gave him on average:

Number of tickets from 'whack a mole': 33
Number of rounds played on 'whack a mole': ?
Average number of tickets per round: ?

To find the average number of tickets per round, we can divide the number of tickets Frank got from playing 'whack a mole' by the number of rounds he played:

Average number of tickets per round = Total number of tickets / Number of rounds
Average number of tickets per round (rounded) = 33 / 1
Average number of tickets per round ≈ 33

Next, we can use the average number of tickets per round to find how many rounds Frank played:

Number of rounds = Total number of tickets / Average number of tickets per round
Number of rounds (rounded) = 33 / 33
Number of rounds = 1

We can now determine how many tickets each game gave him on average:

Number of tickets from 'whack a mole': 33
Number of rounds: 1
Average number of tickets per round: 33
Average number of tickets from 'whack a mole' = Average number of tickets per round
Average number of tickets from 'whack a mole' ≈ 33

Number of tickets from 'skee ball': 9

So, Frank got approximately 33 tickets per round from 'whack a mole' and approximately 9 tickets per round from 'skee ball'. In total, Frank has 42 tickets.

To find out how many candies Frank could buy, we can see how many candies 6 tickets buy:

Candies = Number of tickets / Number of tickets required for each candy
Candies (rounded) = 6 / 6
Candies = 1

Frank has approximately 42 - (1 candy per ticket required to buy 1 candy ÷ 6) = 37 candies, as each candy cost 6 tickets, and we have already bought one candy using the first tickets we earned playing 'whack a mole'.

So, Frank can buy approximately 37 / 1 = 37 candies.

The final answer is: Frank could buy approximately 37 candies with the tickets he has.</s>",7
" At a restaurant each adult meal costs $7 and kids eat free. If a group of 13 people came in and 9 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? ","<|user|>

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     At a restaurant each adult meal costs $7 and kids eat free. If a group of 13 people came in and 9 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we know that each adult meal costs $7. Let's call the number of adult meals ordered x.

2. Next, we know that 9 out of the 13 people are kids, which means that there are 4 adults (13-9). We can find the number of kid meals by multiplying the number of kids by the number of kids' meals (usually free): 9 kids times 0 adult meals is 0 kid meals. Therefore, the number of kid meals is also 0.

3. Now, let's find the total cost for the group. We'll add up the costs of the adult meals, the 0 kid meals, and any additional charges for the group.

4. The cost for the adult meals is x * $7 = $7x.

5. There are no charges for the kids' meals, but the group might be charged a table service fee or some other miscellaneous charges. Let's call this amount z.

6. Therefore, the total cost for the group is $7x + z.

7. Using the given condition (9 kids), we can derive an expression for z in terms of x: 

  x = 13 - 9 (number of adults = total people - number of kids)

  So, x = 4

  Therefore, z would be 0 as kids eat free, and we do not have to pay for them.

8. Plugging our expressions for x and z into our cost equation, we get:

   Total cost = $7 * 4 + 0 = $28

   {The final answer is $28}

1. Calculate the number of math problems Paige has left to do at home.

   Let x be the number of math problems Paige has left to do at home.

   We know she started with 43 problems and completed 44 of them at school, so the equation to find x is:

   x = 43 - 44 (completed problems at school)

   x = -1 (which is not possible, as we can't have a negative number of problems)

   This means that all of the 43 math problems were completed, leaving 0 remaining.

   {0 math problems are left to do at home.}

2. Calculate the total number of science problems.

   Let y be the total number of science problems.

   We know she started with 12 science problems and completed some of them, so the equation to find y is:

   y = 12 - (12 - x) (completed science problems)

   where x is the number of math problems completed at school

   Plugging our result from step 1, we get:

   y = 12 - 0 (completed science problems)

   y = 12 science problems

   {The final answer is 12 science problems.}

3. Since we have already determined that Paige has no math problems left to do at home, we know that the number of total problems left to do is the number of science problems (which is 12).

   Let z be the number of total problems left to do.

   z = x + y (total number of problems left to do)

   z = 0 + 12 (math and science problems remaining)

   z = 12 problems left to do

   {The final answer is 12 problems left to do.}

4. We know how many problems were completed at school, so we can calculate how many were left to do at home.

   Let a be the number of math problems left to do at home.

   Let b be the number of science problems left to do at home.

   When combined with the problems completed at school, we have:

   The number of problems completed in total is:

   a + b + 44

   We know there are 43 math problems and 12 science problems in total, so:

   The number of math problems completed is:

   A + 43

   Similarly, the number of science problems completed is:

   B + 4 (from the 43 - 39 formula from step 1)

   Because we have a closed formula for solving math and science problems based on the number completed altogether (A + B + 44), let's set this up as an equation with A, B, x, and y as unknowns:

   A + B + 44 = 43 + 12 (both A+B and x+y together are 43 + 12)

   Using algebra, we get:

   x = A

   y = B

   From step 1, we know that x = 0, so:

   A = 0 (Math problems completed at school)

   Similarly, y = B, and from step 2, we know y = 12 (total Science problems), so:

   B = 12

   We can now calculate a and b using the equations we just derived:

   a = A = 0

   b = B = 12

   {0 math problems and 12 science problems are left to do at home, for a total of 12 problems left to do altogether.}</s>",11

                     Rachel was playing a video game where she scores 9 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 5 treasures on the first level and 2 on the second, what would her score be? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find Rachel's score, we need to first calculate the number of points she earns for finding treasures on each level. 

* On the first level, Rachel found 5 treasures and scored 9 points for each treasure, for a total of 45 points (5 * 9).
* On the second level, Rachel found 2 treasures and scored 9 points for each treasure, for a total of 18 points (2 * 9).

So, the total points Rachel earned from finding treasures across both levels are 45 points from the first level and 18 points from the second level, for a total of 63 points (45 + 18).

Now, let's add the points Rachel earned for finding treasures to the points she may have earned from other activities in the game (if any). We don't know that information, so we'll assume she didn't earn any points from other activities. 

In this case, Rachel's total score is just the total number of points she earned for finding treasures, which is 63 points.

Therefore, we can say that:

* Rachel earned a total of 63 points from finding treasures.
* Her score also includes points from other activities in the game, but we don't know this information.
* The final answer is: Rachel's score is a total of 63 points from finding treasures, plus an unknown amount of points from other activities in the game.

In other words, Rachel's score is the sum of the points she earned for finding treasures and an unknown number of points from other activities. However, since we don't know the value of this unknown number, we can't write the exact final score. So we'll stop here, and our final answer is: Rachel's score is a total of 63 points from finding treasures, plus an unknown amount of points from other activities in the game.</s>",63

                     A waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 26 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush he added another 27 customers. If 27 of the customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can represent the number of customers who left a tip as x and the number of customers who didn't leave a tip as 27. Since the total number of customers who left a tip and those who didn't leave a tip should be equal to the total number of customers, we can write:

x + 27 = 26 + 27

We can simplify this equation as follows:

x = 26 (when we take the equivalent of 26 from both sides of the equation)

Now, let's differentiate the tips and non-tippers.

The number of customers who left a tip is x, and they didn't add any to the number of non-tippers. So, that means the number of customers who didn't leave any tip is 27. Therefore, the total number of customers is:

x + 27 = 26 + 27

x + 27 = 53

x = 53 - 27

x = 26

So, all in all, the customers who left a tip also equal to 26. Therefore, the number of customers who didn't leave a tip without a tip is 27.

The final answer is: There were 26 customers who left a tip.

Let's now add them to see how many customers came that lunch rush:

26 + 27 = 53

There were 53 customers at the lunch rush, out of which 26 left a tip. The remainder 27 didn't leave any tip. 

{The final answer is: 26 customers left a tip}.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Find the total number of bears after the second shipment arrived:
    Number of bears before shipment = 17
    Number of bears in second shipment = 10
    Total number of bears = 17 + 10
    Number of bears after shipment = 27

2. Calculate the total number of bears on each shelf:
    Total number of bears = 27
    Number of bears on each shelf = 9
    Total number of bears on each shelf = 27 / 3
    Number of bears on each shelf = 9

3. Find the number of shelves to accommodate the total number of bears:
    Total number of bears = 27
    Number of bears on each shelf = 9
    Number of shelves needed = Total number of bears / Number of bears on each shelf
    Number of shelves needed = 27 / 9
    Number of shelves needed = 3

Therefore, the store used three shelves to accommodate all the bears.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's first determine how many mystery books Gwen has. Since she has 5 shelves of mystery books, let's assume each shelf has exactly 4 books, meaning she has a total of 20 mystery books (4 books per shelf times 5 shelves). We can represent this as:

5 shelves x 4 books per shelf = 20 mystery books

Now, let's determine how many picture books Gwen has. She has 3 shelves of picture books, and since she made sure each shelf has exactly 4 books, we can calculate the number of picture books she has in the same way:

3 shelves x 4 books per shelf = 12 picture books

Adding the number of mystery books she has to the number of picture books she has, we can find the total number of books Gwen has:

20 mystery books + 12 picture books = 32 total books

In summary, Gwen has a total of 32 books (20 mystery books and 12 picture books). Our final answer is:

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the information provided to set up a system of equations.

Let x be the number of pictures in each of the 5 albums.

We know that the total number of pictures in the five albums is the difference between the total number of pictures uploaded and the number of pictures in the first album:

x * 5 = 79 - 44

Next, let's create another equation using the total number of pictures in the first album and the remaining 54 pictures. We'll call this quantity y:

44 = x + y

This tells us that the number of pictures in the first album (x) plus the number of pictures in the remaining 5 albums (y) equals the number of pictures in the first album (44).

Now that we have two equations with two unknowns (x and y), we can use substitution to find the values of both variables.

Let's first substitute for x in the second equation and solve for y:

44 = x + 5y

Next, let's substitute for x in the first equation, using the formula we found for y:

5x = 79 - 44

Now we have a single equation with just one variable, making it easy to solve:

x = (79 - 44) / 5

x = 11

So, each album holds 11 pictures.

Final answer: Each album holds 11 pictures. {The final answer is 11.}</s>",7

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people are in total and how many people are needed in each group.

Let's first find the total number of people on the debate team:

5 boys = 5 × 70 = 350 debate team members

40 girls = 40 × 70 = 2800 debate team members

Total number of people on the debate team: 350 + 2800 = 3150

Now, let's find how many people are needed in each group of 9:

9 people = 1 boy (since there were 5 boys in total and each group needs 1 boy) and 8 girls (since there were 40 girls in total and each group needs 8 girls.)

To find how many groups can be made with this many people, we can divide the total number of people by the number of people needed in each group:

Total number of groups = Total number of people ÷ Number of people needed in each group

Total number of groups = 3150 ÷ 9

Total number of groups = 350 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

<|assistant|>
1. April originally purchased 9 roses at a price of $7 each, for a total cost of $63 (9 roses x $7 = $63).

2. After the sale, each rose was sold for $7. April now has 4 roses left. We can find the price of each of these remaining roses by dividing the total amount April originally spent on flowers ($63) by the number of roses she had left after the sale (4). The price per rose is $15.75 (63 divided by 4).

3. Since April now has 4 roses left at a price of $15.75 each, the price she earned for these 4 roses is $62.50 (4 roses x $15.75).

4. We know that April started with 9 roses and earned $62.50 for the 4 she sold. We can determine how much she earned overall by finding how much she earned from selling the 5 roses she didn't sell (i.e. The original 5 roses she started with, less the 4 she already sold).

5. To find the price for each of the 5 remaining roses, we subtract the price of the 4 sold roses ($62.50) from the original price of the 9 roses ($63). The cost of the remaining 5 roses is $10.50 (63 - 62.50 = 10.50).

6. Each of the 5 remaining roses originally cost $7. The difference between the original price and the reduced sale price ($7 - $1.75 = $5.25) is the discount amount. To find the total discount amount, multiply the discount ($1.25) by the total number of roses originally purchased (9). The discount amount is $11.25 (9 discounts of $1.25 each).

7. The total cost of the original 9 roses, after applying the discount, is $61.25 ($63 less the discount amount of $11.25).

8. All in all, April earned $62.50 for selling the 4 roses at the sale's price of $15.75 each, and she earned $5.50 from selling the remaining 5 roses after the sale (5 roses at the reduced sale price of $5.25 each). Therefore, the total amount April earned is $68 (the sum of the sale revenue of $62.50 and the sale's earnings of $5.50).

{The final answer is: $68}

So, April earned $68 altogether from the sale of her 9 original rose flowers.</s>",35

<|assistant|>
Step 1:
Let x be the number of points scored by the members who showed up for the game.

Step 2:
We are given that 11 members were in the trivia team, and 6 of them didn't show up. Therefore, the number of members who showed up is 11-6, which is 5.

Step 3:
The members who showed up scored a total of 9 points each. To find the total number of points scored by them, we can calculate:

5 members x 9 points per member = 45 points

Step 4:
We also know that the total number of points scored (by all members, both those who showed up and those who didn't) is equal to the total number of points scored by only the members who showed up, plus the number of points scored by the members who didn't show up. This can be expressed mathematically as:

(Number of points scored by all members) = (Number of points scored by members who showed up) + (Number of points scored by members who didn't show up)

Step 5:
Now that we know how many points were scored by the members who showed up, we can substitute this into Step 4 to find the number of points scored by the members who didn't show up:

Total number of points scored = 45 points + (Number of points scored by members who didn't show up)

Step 6:
Next, we know that 6 members did not show up for the game. We also know that each non-showing member could have scored a maximum of 9 points. Therefore, the number of points that these members would have scored in total is:

6 missing members x 9 points per member = 54 points

Step 7:
We compare this with the expression in Step 5 to equate the number of points scored by the missing members with the number of points that needs to be deducted from the total scored to get the right score. This can be expressed mathematically as:

(Number of points scored by all members) - (Number of points scored by members who didn't show up) = Total number of points scored

(Total number of points scored by both showing and missing members) - (Number of points scored by missing members) = Total number of points scored

The final expression, after substituting the points found in Step 5 and Step 6 is:

(45 points + 54 points) - 54 points = Total number of points scored

Step 8:
Simplify the equation to get the final solution:

45 points = Total number of points scored

The final answer is 45. {The final answer is 45.}</s>",45

<|assistant|>
Step 1: Determine the number of cats the pet store had before the sale, which is the total of both Siamese and house cats.

Number of Siamese cats before sale = 13
Number of house cats before sale = 5
Total number of cats before sale = 13 + 5 = 18

Step 2: Determine the number of Siamese cats they sold during the sale

Let x be the number of Siamese cats sold

Number of Siamese cats after sale = Number of Siamese cats before sale - Number of Siamese cats sold

Number of Siamese cats after sale = 13 - x

Step 3: Determine the number of house cats they sold during the sale

Let y be the number of house cats sold

Number of house cats after sale = Number of house cats before sale - Number of house cats sold

Number of house cats after sale = 5 - y

Step 4: Determine the total number of cats they sold during the sale

Number of cats sold = Number of Siamese cats sold + Number of house cats sold

Number of cats sold = x + y

Step 5: Determine the total number of cats they have left after the sale

Total number of cats after sale = Total number of cats before sale - Number of cats sold

Total number of cats after sale = 18 - (x + y)

Step 6: Substitute x and y for their values found in steps 2 and 3

Number of cats sold = 10

x = Number of Siamese cats sold
y = Number of house cats sold

Let's find x and y

Number of Siamese cats sold = x

Number of house cats sold = 10 - x (Subtraction of x from the total number of Siamese cats sold makes up the difference of the house cats sold)

Step 7: Plug both of the equations for x and y into the equation for the total number of cats after sale

Total number of cats after sale = 18 - (x + (10 - x))

Total number of cats after sale = 18 - 10

Total number of cats after sale = 8

The final number of cats they have left after the sale is 8.

{The final answer is 8.}

Here's the complete solution:

Before the sale:
Number of Siamese cats = 13
Number of house cats = 5
Total number of cats = 18

During the sale:
Number of Siamese cats sold = x
Number of house cats sold = 10 - x

Total number of cats sold = x + (10 - x) = 10

After the sale:
Number of Siamese cats = 13 - x
Number of house cats = 5 - (10 - x)
Total number of cats = 8

To calculate how much money Victor made in those two days, we first need to find out how much he earned on each day.

On Monday, Victor worked for 5 hours and earned $6 per hour, so his earnings for Monday are $30 (5 hours at $6 per hour).

On Tuesday, he worked for another 5 hours, so his earnings for Tuesday are also $30 (5 hours at $6 per hour).

Adding these amounts together, we get a total earnings of $60 for the two days ($30 earnings on Monday plus $30 earnings on Tuesday).

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of packages Megan can make if she puts 7 cupcakes in each package. First, we know that Megan baked a total of 71 cupcakes. Some of these cupcakes, specifically 43, were eaten by her brother Todd. This leaves us with the total number of cupcakes available for packaging:

Total cupcakes = 71 cupcakes minus 43 cupcakes eaten by Todd
Total cupcakes = 28 cupcakes

Next, we want to find out how many cupcakes will be in each package. Since each package will contain 7 cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 28 cupcakes by 7 to get the number of packages Megan can make:

Number of packages = Total remaining cupcakes divided by Number of cupcakes per package
Number of packages = 28 cupcakes divided by 7 cupcakes per package
Number of packages = 4 packages (rounded down because the result is not a whole number)

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Step 1: Identify the number of friends playing the game before new players joined. Let's call this number x. Therefore, we know that each friend had 6 lives, so in total, the friends had 6 times x number of lives before the new players joined. (x friends, each with 6 lives) = 6x lives 

Step 2: Two new players joined the game. Let's call the number of new players y. We also know that these new players also had 6 lives each, when they joined.

Step 3: We want to find out the total number of lives all players had after the new players joined.

Step 4: First, let's calculate the number of lives the friends had after the new players joined. Since new players joined, the friends' original number of lives did not change. Therefore, the friends still had 6 times x lives (x friends, each with 6 lives) = 6x lives.

Step 5: We need to calculate the number of lives the new players had after they joined. As we know, each new player had 6 lives when they joined, so now we have y new lives after they joined.

Step 6: Now let's add the number of lives the friends and new players had together to get the total number of lives all players had. 

Step 7: We know the friends had 6 times x lives after the new players joined, and the new players had y new lives.

Step 8: Adding the two numbers, we get the total number of lives all players had after new players joined: (6x lives) + (y new lives) = Total number of lives.

Therefore, the final answer is: after the new players joined, all players had a total of (6x lives) + (y new lives) lives in the game.

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of socks Sam had before throwing away some old ones as x.

We know that Sam had 10 socks before, so x = 10.

When Sam threw away 3 old socks that didn't fit, the number of socks he had left decreased by 3. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x - 3 = number of socks left after throwing away old socks

When Sam bought 36 new socks, the total number of socks he had increased by 36. Let's call the total number of socks Sam now has y. Here's the equation to represent this:

x - 3 + 36 = y

Let's substitute x = 10 into the second equation:

10 - 3 + 36 = y

Simplifying,

33 = y

So, the final number of socks Sam has is 33. Here's the final answer:

{The final answer is: 33}

This represents the total number of socks Sam now has, after throwing away old socks and buying new ones.</s>",43

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's break this down and solve it step by step.

1. Wendy picked a total of 103 flowers for the wedding.
2. She made bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. Therefore, she picked 8 flowers at a time, leaving us with a total of 103 divided by 8, which equals 12.9375 (let's round down to 12). This tells us that Wendy picked 12 bouquets in total.
3. However, 47 flowers wilted before the wedding, so we need to determine how many bouquets Wendy can still make with the remaining flowers.
4. We know that Wendy picked a total of 12 bouquets, and we know that 12 * 8 (the number of flowers in each bouquet) gives us the total number of flowers that Wendy originally picked (103).
5. Now, since 47 of the flowers wilted, the number of flowers left (after accounting for the bouquets made) is 103 - (8 * 12) - 47. This gives us 103 - 96 = 7. This number is much too small to create additional bouquets (we would need at least 48 flowers for 6 bouquets), so, unfortunately, Wendy won't be able to make any more bouquets.

{Final answer: Wendy could still make all 12 bouquets at the wedding, for a total of 96 flowers. She will not be able to make any additional bouquets because only 7 flowers remained after accounting for the original bouquets and the wilted flowers.}</s>",7

                     Adam had 48 books. If he sold 19 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Adam have? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of variable to represent the number of books Adam has after selling and buying books. Let's call this variable x. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Adam initially had 48 books. We can write this as an equation: x = 48

2. Adam sold 19 books. Since we're using a variable to represent the number of books he has, let's call this number y. This means that Adam had 19 more books than when he started, and he sold them. We can represent this mathematically as follows:

x - 19 = y

3. Adam used the money he earned from selling the books to buy 38 new ones. Let's call this number z. This means that the money Adam made from selling the books is equal to the price of the new 38 books. We write this as:

19y = 380

4. We can now find the number of books Adam has left after buying the new ones. Let's call this number w. This is the number of books Adam has when the 38 new ones are added to the number of books he has after selling some books. Written mathematically:

x - 19 + 38 = w

5. Let's substitute the equation for y into the equation for w, and then simplify and combine like terms:

x - 19 + 38 = x - 19 + 380/19

6. Simplifying and combining like terms:

x - 19 + 380/19 = x + 20

7. Subtracting x from both sides:

-19 + 380/19 = 20

8. Multiplying both sides by 19:

-361 = 3800 (Since we're checking for reasonableness, -361 is outside of our desired range, indicating an error)

9. This reveals a logic error: Adam cannot have sold more books than he initially had. Since we have used a variable, y, to represent the number of books Adam sold, we see that our equation ""x - 19 = y"" now has the wrong signs. Let's change the sign of the 19 in the equation for y to fix the error:

x - 19 = y

10. Proceeding as before, let's find Adam's final number of books:

x - 19 + 380/19 = x + 20

11. Subtracting x from both sides:

-19 + 3800/19 = 20 (This new equation is within our desired range of reasonableness)

12. Multiplying both sides by 19:

-361 = 20000

13. Since we are not checking for reasonableness at this step, we'll move forward:

x = -36100

14. However, our original equation ""x = 48"" indicates that we're expecting a positive value for x, not a negative one. So let's go back to our mistake and find a new equation for y:

x + 19 = y

Finally, here's Adam's final number of books:

x + 19 - 3800/19 = x + 200 (This final answer is within our desired range of reasonableness)

x = -204200

{The final answer is: Adam has -204,200 books}

However, since Adam cannot have fewer than zero books, this result is not reasonable. Therefore, this expression doesn't represent a possible scenario.</s>",67

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To determine how many vans Nancy's class will require for their field trip to the zoo, we need to calculate the total number of people traveling and then divide it by the capacity of each van. Let's represent the number of students as x and the number of adults as y.

Total number of people = 12 students (x) + 3 adults (y)
Total number of people = x + 3y

The capacity of each van is 5 people, so we divide the total number of people by the van capacity to find the number of vans required:

Number of vans = Total number of people / Van capacity
Number of vans = (x + 3y) / 5

Substituting the values we defined earlier, we get:

Number of vans = (x + 3y) / 5

To ensure the total number of students and adults fits the criteria, we can assume the number of students is twice the number of adults. 

x = 2y

Substituting this into our previous formula, we get:

Number of vans = (2y + 3y) / 5
Number of vans = (5y) / 5
Number of vans = y

Therefore, the class will need y vans, where y represents the number of adults in the group.

{The final answer is an integer value for y, which ensures that the total number of students and adults is feasible for the field trip. As an example, if we set y = 2, the class would require 2 vans, or with y = 3, the class would require 3 vans, and so on.}

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find out how many shelves Tom will fill up with sodas, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of regular sodas: 4 regular sodas
2. Convert the diet soda count to the total number of diet sodas: 52 diet sodas = 52 * 1 diet soda = 52 regular sodas
3. Find the total number of sodas Tom bought: Total number of sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
              = 4 regular sodas + 52 regular sodas (equivalent to diet sodas)
              = 56 regular sodas
4. Calculate how many diet sodas each shelf can hold: Each shelf can hold 7 diet sodas
5. Calculate how many regular sodas each shelf can hold (since diet sodas can be swapped with regular sodas): Regular sodas per shelf = (Number of regular sodas in total) / (Number of shelves)
               = (56 regular sodas) / (Number of shelves)
6. Find the number of shelves required by swapping diet sodas with regular sodas: Number of shelves required for diet sodas = Diet sodas / (Diet sodas per shelf)
              = 52 regular sodas / (7 diet sodas per shelf)
            Number of shelves required for regular sodas = Number of shelves required for diet sodas (from step 6) - Number of shelves required for empty spaces (since the fridge can't hold all the sodas)
              = 6 (rounded up) - Floor(6) (the floor function rounds down to nearest integer)
7. Verify the feasibility of the solution: If the shelves required for regular and diet sodas combined is more than the maximum number of shelves that can fit in the fridge, then we need to check whether we can adjust the values by swapping more diet sodas with regular sodas. 

{The final answer is} 6 shelves will be filled up by Tom's sodas. However, since the fridge can hold only 7 sodas on each shelf, some of the sodas might go unused and may require rearranging the shelves or using fewer sodas for the party.</s>",8

Step 2: Find out how many apples were used to make lunch for the students.
The school used 20 apples to make lunch for the students.

Step 3: Determine how many apples the school had in total after making lunch for the students.
The school had 38 - 20 = 18 apples remaining after making lunch for the students.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps. Here's how we can find the number of trips Luke will make:

1. First, let's figure out how many trays Luke will pick up from the first table (20 trays). Since he can carry 4 trays at a time, we can divide 20 by 4 to get the number of trips required for this table:

   Number of trips for first table = Total number of trays / Number of trays per trip

   number of trips for first table = 20 ÷ 4 = 5

2. Next, let's do the same for the second table (16 trays):

   Number of trips for second table = Total number of trays / Number of trays per trip

   number of trips for second table = 16 ÷ 4 = 4

3. Now that we have the number of trips required for each table, we can add them together to find the total number of trips Luke will make:

   Total number of trips = Number of trips for first table + Number of trips for second table

   total number of trips = 5 + 4 = 9

   - The cafeteria had 96 apples.
   - For lunch, they handed out 42 apples to the students.
   - They used the remaining apples to make pies.
   - Each pie takes 6 apples.

2. Find the number of apples left after lunch:
   - Total number of apples = 96
   - Number of apples handed out = 42
   - Difference = Total number of apples - Number of apples handed out
      96 - 42 = 54 apples left after lunch

3. Calculate the number of pies that can be made with the remaining apples:
   - Number of apples left after lunch = 54
   - Number of apples required for one pie = 6
   - Number of pies that can be made = Total number of apples left after lunch divided by the number of apples required for one pie
      54 / 6 = 9 pies

4. Check if this makes sense:
   - If you add the number of apples they handed out (42) and the number of pies they made (9), the total number of apples should come close to the original number of apples.

<|assistant|>
To find out how much money Henry needs to finish his collection, we need to calculate the total cost of the remaining 5 action figures. Let's call the total cost of 8 action figures $x$.

We know Henry already has 3 action figures, so he needs to buy 5 more to complete the collection. The total cost of the first 3 action figures was $18$ ($3$ action figures each costing $6$).

The total cost of 8 action figures is $x$. The total cost of the first 3 action figures is $18$. This means the total cost of the remaining 5 action figures is $x-18$.

Now, let's find the total cost of the remaining 5 action figures in terms of their unit cost:

Total cost of the remaining 5 action figures = (Unit cost of each action figure) × 5

Each action figure costs $6$, so:

Total cost of the remaining 5 action figures = 5(6) = $30$

But we found the total cost of the remaining 5 action figures to be $x-18$.

So, $x-18$ = 30

$x$ = 30 + 18

$x$ = 48

Therefore, Henry needs to spend $48$ dollars to complete his collection of 8 action figures.

In summary, we started with Henry already having 3 action figures but needing 8 in total, with each action figure costing $6$. We calculated the total cost of completing his collection and found that Henry would need to spend a total of $48$ dollars to finish his collection. {The final answer is $48$.}</s>",30

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Find the total number of carrots picked by Vanessa and her mom:
   Vanessa picked 17 carrots, and her mom picked 14 carrots, so in total, they picked 31 carrots.

2. Find the number of good carrots:
   Vanessa and her mom picked a total of 24 good carrots.

3. Find the number of bad carrots:
   Since they picked a total of 31 carrots, and there were 24 good carrots, the number of bad carrots must be equal to the difference between the total number of carrots (31) and the number of good carrots (24).
   Math: Bad carrots = Total carrots - Good carrots
   Substitute the values we have: Bad carrots = 31 - 24
   The final answer is: They picked a total of 7 bad carrots.

4. Display the final answer:
   In total, they picked 38 carrots (the good ones plus the 7 bad ones). So, they had 38 - 24 = 14 bad carrots.

The final answer is: There were 14 bad carrots in total.

Alternate solution: 
Another way to find the number of bad carrots is by using a system of equations.
Let x be the number of bad carrots that Vanessa and her mom picked.
Then, the number of good carrots could be expressed as follows:
Good carrots = 17 (good carrots from Vanessa) + 14 (good carrots from Mom) - x (bad carrots from both)

Plugging in values for good and bad carrots, we get:
24 = 17 + 14 - x
Simplify:
24 = 31 - x
Rearrange:
-x = 31 - 24
Calculate x:
x = -3
But we cannot have a negative number of bad carrots, so this approach isn't practical, despite being mathematically sound. We'll stick with our initial calculation method.</s>",7

                    question:
                     At a company picnic 23 managers and 7 employees decided to start a game of volleyball. If they split into 6 teams how many people would be on each team? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find out how many people will be on each team when 23 managers and 7 employees split into 6 teams, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of people
The total number of people is the sum of managers and employees, which is 23 + 7 = 30.

Step 2: Find how many people will be in each team
To find out how many people will be on each team, we divide the total number of people by the number of teams. Here, we have 30 people and 6 teams, so:

Number of people in each team = Total number of people / Number of teams
Number of people in each team = 30 / 6
Number of people in each team = 5

Step 3: The final answer
So, each team will have 5 people. {The final answer is: 5 people per team}. 

Another way to find the number of people in each team is to use formulas for finding the quotient (number of teams) and remainder (number of people left over) when dividing a total number of people by the number of people in each team. Here's how:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of people
As before, the total number of people is the sum of managers and employees, which is 23 + 7 = 30.

Step 2: Calculate the quotient and remainder
Now divide the total number of people by the number of people in each team to find the quotient and remainder. Here, we'll use the managers and employees as separate groups, and the formula for finding the quotient and remainder when dividing whole numbers:

Quotient = Total number of people / number of people in each team
Remainder = Total number of people modulo (%) number of people in each team

Let's calculate these values separately for managers and employees:

Number of managers in each team = Total number of managers / Number of managers in each team
Remainder for managers = Total number of managers modulo (%) Number of managers in each team

Number of employees in each team = Total number of employees / Number of employees in each team
Remainder for employees = Total number of employees modulo (%) Number of employees in each team

Number of managers in each team = 23 / 5
Number of managers in each team = 4
Remainder for managers is 23 modulo 5, which is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If you're using a calculator, you can use the modulo function (often denoted as %).

Number of employees in each team = 7 / 5
Number of employees in each team = 1
Remainder for employees is 7 modulo 5, which is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Now, let's check both the managers' and employees' remainders against the number of managers and employees already accounted for:

Total number of managers = 4 teams * 5 managers per team = 20 managers
Remainder for managers = 3 managers left over (not all managers can be accommodated in teams)

Total number of employees = 6 teams * 1 employee per team = 6 employees
Remainder for employees = 1 employee left over (all employees can be accommodated in teams)

Add both these remainders to the number of people in the full teams we've already counted:

Number of people in each team = Total people accounted for + Remainder
Number of people in each team = 25 + 3
Number of people in each team = 28

For this problem, whether you use the quotient and remainder formula or the straightforward divide-by-six approach, you'll get the same answer of 5 people per team. Either way works, and both paths are valid. It's just a matter of choosing whichever suits you better!</s>",5

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to find the number of brownies Tiffany needs to bake in order to have a total of 17 brownies for her party. Let's call this number x.

original number of brownies: 8
number of brownies needed for party: 17

using the formula for finding the total number of brownies when the number of brownies baked per time is a variable (x), we can set up the equation:

8 = x - 8 (original number of brownies minus those needed for party)

8x - 64 = 17 (using the original number of brownies and the number of brownies needed for the party)

x = (17 + 64) / 8 (this is equivalent to isolating the variable x on one side of the equation)

x = 81 / 8 (simplifying the expression)

we can't have a fractional brownie, so we find that x is 10.125 brownies. Since we're only concerned with the number of cups of flour used, we just need to know how many flour cups are needed for the additional 2.125 brownies.

using the information we have, we know that 8 original brownies used 8 cups of flour, and 2.125 brownies will use 2.125 times 8 cups (since each original brownie used 1 cup). However, we do not know the exact number of flour cups used by one brownie after we've baked this many more.

to find the exact number of flour cups needed for the additional 2.125 brownies, we can set up a ratio to determine an equivalent quantity of flour cups based on the ratio of flour cups to brownies.

8 cups of flour : 8 brownies :: x cups of flour : x brownies

using the information we have from the additional brownies, we can calculate the ratio of flour cups to brownies to determine the exact amount of flour needed to make the additional 2.125 brownies.

8 / 8 = x / 2.125 (setting up a ratio with equivalent quantities)

8 * 2.125 = x (solving the formula for x)

x = 17.5 cups (rounding up)

finally, since we've already used 64 cups of flour in baking the original 8 brownies, we simply need to find the sum of these quantities to find the total number of cups of flour needed for 17 brownies.

64 cups of flour (original brownies) + 17.5 cups of flour (additional brownies) = 81.5 cups of flour (total number of flour cups for 17 brownies)

the final answer is: 81.5 cups of flour are needed to make 17 brownies for tiffany's party.</s>",72
" Carol and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked 29 and her mother picked 16. If only 38 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have? ","<|user|>

                     Carol and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked 29 and her mother picked 16. If only 38 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Find the total number of carrots picked.
Carol picked 29 carrots, and her mother picked 16 carrots. So, the total number of carrots picked is:

29 carrots picked by Carol
16 carrots picked by mother

Total = 29 + 16
Total = 45 carrots

Step 2: Find the number of good carrots.
We know that only 38 out of the total 45 carrots were good. So, the number of good carrots is:

Number of good carrots = 38

Step 3: Find the number of bad carrots.
The total number of carrots and the number of good carrots are already known. The unknown quantity is the number of bad carrots.

The total number of carrots picked = Number of good carrots + Number of bad carrots

Let's use the above equation to calculate the number of bad carrots:

45 carrots = 38 good carrots + Number of bad carrots

Let's solve this equation to find the number of bad carrots:

45 - 38 = 38 + Number of bad carrots

Number of bad carrots = 45 - 38
Number of bad carrots = 7

Therefore, the number of bad carrots is 7.

Step 4: Show the final answer.
The total number of carrots picked was 45. Out of these, 38 were good, and 7 were bad. This makes a total of 45 carrots picked. So, the final answer to our problem is:

The total number of bad carrots picked was 7.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find the number of remaining problems to grade, we need to find the total number of problems left on all the ungraded worksheets and then subtract the number of problems that have already been graded on these sheets. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Let x be the number of remaining problems after the teacher has graded all the remaining worksheets.
2. We know the teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, and each worksheet has 7 problems. Therefore, the number of problems that have already been graded is 8 times 7, or 56.
3. The teacher still has 17 worksheets to grade, so the number of remaining worksheets is 17.
4. Using the information above, we can calculate the total number of remaining problems as the number of remaining worksheets (17) times the number of problems per worksheet (7): 17 times 7, or 119.
5. We also know that the teacher has already graded some portion of these problems. From Part 2, we know that the number of problems she has already graded is 56.
6. We can now subtract the number of problems she has already graded (56) from the number of remaining problems (119) to get the number of remaining problems after she has graded all the remaining worksheets: 119 - 56, or 63.
7. Therefore, the teacher will have graded a total of 56 problems plus the remaining 63 problems, which equals 119 problems. This is our final answer. The final answer is: The teacher will have graded a total of 119 problems.

{The final answer is: The teacher will have graded a total of 119 problems.}</s>",63

                     There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 6 lives, how many lives did they have total? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of friends playing the video game online by the variable x. The initial number of lives for each friend is 6, so the total number of lives at the beginning is 6x. When two more players join the game, the total number of friends playing increases by 2. Let's call the total number of friends after the new players join y. We can represent this relation as y = x + 2.

Now let's calculate the total number of lives after the new players join the game. Each of the original friends still has 6 lives, and the new friends each have an unknown number of lives, which we'll represent by z. Let's calculate the total number of lives after the join:

Total number of lives after joining = 6 (initial number of lives for each friend) * x (initial number of friends) + z (number of lives for new friends) * 2 (number of new friends)

Using the relation y = x + 2, we can replace x in the formula for the initial number of friends with y - 2 to find the equation for the total number of lives after joining:

Total number of lives after joining = 6 * (y - 2) + z * 2 

Now, we want to find expressions for y and z in terms of the original number of friends x. We can substitute y = x + 2 and x = y - 2 (found from the prior relation) into the expression for the total number of lives after joining:

Total number of lives after joining = 6 * (y - 2) + z * 2
Total number of lives after joining = 6 * (x + 2 - 2) + 2 * z
Total number of lives after joining = 6x + 12 + 2z

The final answer is the total number of lives after joining as calculated above:

{The final answer is} Total number of lives after joining = 6x + 12

This expression allows us to find the total number of lives after the new players join, given the initial number of friends x. By substituting the value of x, we can calculate the exact number of lives for our specific scenario.

Example: If there were 8 friends playing the video game online with 6 lives each, and 2 more friends joined the game, how many lives do they have in total?

Let's substitute x = 8 into the expression for the total number of lives after joining:

Total number of lives after joining = 6x + 12
Total number of lives after joining = 6 * 8 + 12
Total number of lives after joining = 48

Therefore, the total number of lives after the new friends join would be 48.

So, we can now play the video game online having a total of 48 lives for our group of 10 players!

Note: The variable 'y' in the expressions we've derived represents the total number of friends playing after the new players join. However, since we're not explicitly using this value in our final answer, this variable can be eliminated from the expression, leaving only 'x'. This simplified expression (6x + 12) still holds true for calculating the total number of lives when new players join the game. The final formula for calculating the total number of lives after new players join, given the initial number of friends x, is given above, without y.</s>",60

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of tickets Cody has after winning 6 more tickets. First, let's find out how many tickets Cody has after spending 25 tickets on a beanie.

Let's call the number of total tickets Cody had before buying the beanie x.
Then, we know that x - 25 = 49 (we Subtracted the number of tickets Cody spent on the beanie from his total number of tickets to find out how many tickets he had left after buying the beanie.)

So, x = 74 (After solving the equation x - 25 = 49 for x, we get the value of x as 74.)

Now, we know that after winning 6 more tickets, Cody will have a total of 74 + 6 = 80 tickets.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we know that Bianca received a total of 78 pieces of candy. She then ate 30 of them, leaving her with a total of 48 pieces. This can be shown by setting up an equation:

   Number of candies Bianca received = Number of candies Bianca ate + Number of candies Bianca still has

   Or,

   78 = 30 + 48

   This equation represents the number of candies Bianca received as the sum of the number of candies she ate and the number of candies she still has.

   {The final answer is: 78 = 30 + 48}

2. Next, we see that the remaining 48 candies have been placed into piles with each pile containing 8 pieces. Since there are no other details provided, we can assume that Bianca has placed these candies into an unknown number of piles. Let's represent the number of piles as x.

   {The final answer is: 48 can be distributed into x piles with each pile containing 8 candies}

3. To calculate the number of piles, we can use the formula for finding the number of times a number divides evenly into another number, called the quotient, and the remainder.

   The formula is:

   Number of items = Quotient × Number in each group + Remainder, if any

   Since we’re looking for x, the number of piles, and we know that each pile has 8 candies, we can set up an equation as follows:

   48 = x × 8 + Remainder

4. Since each pile has 8 candies, let's assume there are no remaining candies left that have not been distributed into piles. This means there are no remaining candies at all, so there is zero remainder.

   48 = x × 8

   After simplifying the equation, we get:

   x = 6

   {The final answer is: Bianca can make 6 piles with each pile containing 8 candies}

   The total number of candies in all the piles would be:

   8 × Number of piles = 8 × 6 = 48

   {The final answer is: The total number of candies in all the piles is 48}

   We can confirm it by the fact that earlier, we calculated the leftover candies after distributing in piles, which was assumed to have zero as the remainder. 

   {The final answer is: The remaining candies after distributing in piles is zero}

   So, we can say that Bianca distributed all the remaining candies in piles after taking 30 herself.

   {The final answer is: Bianca made a total of 6 piles, each containing 8 candies, and she has distributed all the remaining candies after eating 30 herself}

<|assistant|
Step 1: We know that there were initially 5 friends playing the video game online, and each of them had 8 lives.

Step 2: We can represent the initial number of lives as 5 times 8, which equals 40 overall. This can be written as 40 lives in total.

Step 3: Two more players joined the game, so the total number of players increased to 7.

Step 4: Since each new player had 8 lives, just like the initial 5 players, we can calculate the number of lives they added collectively as: (number of new players) times (number of lives for each new player)

Step 5: This expression can be written as 2 times 8, and we can simplify this as 16 lives. This leaves us with a total of 56 lives for all players, which can be represented as: (initial number of lives) + (number of lives added by new players) = total number of lives.

Step 6: To summarize, the total number of lives is:

40 lives (initial number of lives) + 16 lives (number of lives added by new players) = 56 lives (total number of lives).

So, we have:

Total price = $8x (cost for adult meals) + $0 (cost for kids' meals)

Now, we can find the value of x by substituting the number of adults (9) and the number of kids (2) in our expression.

Total price = $8(9) + $0(2)

Let this be called 'oldBooks'

Number of books Roger buys with the money earned from selling old ones = 30

oldBooks = x - 21

Next, we find y, the amount of money Roger earns from selling 21 old books. The price Roger received for each old book can be represented as p.

y = 21 p

Finally, we find z, the price of each new book.

z = y / 30

<|assistant|>
Let's call the number of lives Wendy had after losing 6 lives in the hard part x.

We can represent this mathematically as:

x - 6 = 10

This equation is read as ""x minus 6 is equal to 10"". In other words, Wendy had initially 10 lives and then she lost 6 of them, ending with x lives left.

Next, Wendy received 37 more lives in the next level. Let's call this number y.

x + 37 = y

This equation shows that the original number of lives left (x) and the additional 37 lives received in the next level (37) combined to give y, the total number of lives Wendy now has at this point.

To get the final number of lives, we need to combine the two equations above:

x - 6 = 10
x + 37 = y

Let's solve the first equation for x:

x = 10 + 6
x = 16

Substitute x = 16 into the second equation:

16 + 37 = y
y = 53

So Wendy now has 53 lives in total.

{The final answer is 53}

In summary, Wendy started with 10 lives, lost 6 lives, and then gained 37 lives, resulting in a total of 53 lives.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Let's find how much money Frank has left after buying the new blades. Frank made a total of $19 mowing lawns, and he spent $11 on the new blades. The amount of money left with Frank is:

   $19 - $11 = $8

2. We want to find out how many 2-$ games Frank could buy with the $8 he has left. To do this, we need to divide the money he has left by the cost of one game. The number of games Frank could buy is:

   $8 \div $2 = 4

3. Frank could, therefore, buy four 2-dollar games with the money he has left. So, the final answer is:

   {Frank could buy 4 games with the money he has left.}




Here's a visual aide that may help clarify the solution.

Frank made $19 in total from mowing lawns over the summer.
!(https://imgur.com/JBhJ4n.png)

He then spent $11 buying new mower blades.

The result is that Frank has $8 left.

Now the money Frank has leftover we are trying to find out how many of the $2 games he can buy with it.

To find out, we take the amount of money Frank has left, and divide it by the cost of one game ($2).

This will give us the number of games Frank can buy, which is 4.

So, Frank can buy 4 games with the $8 he has leftover.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of division to find the number of groups. Here are the steps:

1. First, let's find out how many players in total there are. We know that there are 48 new players and 6 returning players, so the total number of players is:

   total players = 48 new players + 6 returning players

   total players = 48 + 6

   total players = 54

2. Next, we want to find out how many players are in each group. We know that there are 6 players in each group.

   Number of players in each group = 6

3. Divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group to find out how many groups we need.

   Number of groups = Total number of players ÷ Number of players in each group

   Number of groups = 54 ÷ 6

   Number of groups = 9

   Therefore, there would be 9 groups in total.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
1. The initial number of games Luke had was 39. (39)

2. He sold 19 games, which left him with the remaining number of games.

   a. To find the remaining number of games, we can subtract the number of games sold (19) from the initial number of games (39).

   b. Therefore, the remaining number of games is 20 (39 - 19 = 20). (20)

3. Next, we know that Luke packed the remaining games into each box, four at a time. We can determine how many games are in each box by dividing the number of remaining games (20) by the number of games packed in each box (4).

   a. So, each box has 5 games (20 ÷ 4 = 5).

4. We can find the total number of boxes Luke used by dividing the total number of games packed in all boxes by the number of games packaged in each box (5).

   a. Let x be the number of boxes Luke used.

   b. To find the total number of games packed in all boxes, we multiply the number of games packaged in each box (5) by the number of boxes Luke used (x).

   c. Therefore, the total number of games packed in all boxes is 25 (x * 5 = 25).

   d. Now, we know that Luke sold 19 of his initial 39 games. The remaining number of games, as we calculated earlier, is 20. Therefore, the total number of games Luke had after selling initial games (39) and the new games he packed into boxes is 39 + 20 - 19 = 30.

   e. But the sum of the total number of games packed in all boxes should be equal to the total number of games Luke had. (See Step 6 below)

   f. So, we arrive at the conclusion that x is 6. (25 = 30, which is obtained by calculating the total number of games packed in all boxes and subtracting the number of games Luke had (30) from the total number of games packed in all boxes (25).

5. The final answer is {Luke used 6 boxes to pack the remaining 5 games in each of them}.

6. Let's verify if our calculation is correct or not.

   a. As we calculated earlier, the total number of games packed in all boxes is 25.

   b. We know that Luke used x number of boxes, and each box had 5 games. Therefore, the number of games packed in all boxes is x * 5.

   c. Therefore, the total number of games packed in all boxes is 30 (same number we got earlier).

   d. This indicates that our calculation is correct. 

7. If we wish to find the number of games Luke had after packing the rest in boxes, then we can add the number of games Luke sold (19) to the initial number of games (39) minus the number of games remaining (which is 20). 

   a. Therefore, the number of games Luke had after selling some and packing the rest into boxes is 50 (39 + 19 - 20 = 50). (50)

8. If we wish to find the number of games Luke still had after packing the rest in boxes, then we can subtract the number of games Luke had after selling some and packing the rest into boxes (50) from the total number of games Luke had initially (39).

   a. Therefore, the number of games Luke still had after packing the rest in boxes is 0 (50 - 39 = 0). (0)

9. If we wish to find the number of games that Luke still had after selling the initial number of games (39) and then packed the rest into boxes, then we can again use the number of games Lucas had initially (39) and deduct the number of games he sold (19) and the number of games he still had after packing the rest into boxes (0).

   a. Therefore, the number of games Luke still had was 0 during this step too (39 - 19 - 0 = 0). (0)

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many students are left after 17 have been excluded from the trivia teams. Let's call this number x. We can write this as an equation:

65 students - 17 excluded students = x students in the trivia teams

65 - 17 = 48 students in the trivia teams (we can subtract 17 from 65 to get this value)

x = 48 students in the trivia teams

Now, we know that there are 8 groups, and each group contains students from the trivia teams. Let's call the number of students in each group y. We can write this as an equation:

8 groups with y students each = 48 students in the trivia teams

8y = 48

y = 6 students in each group (we can divide both sides by 8 to get this value)

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the information provided to build a system of equations that represents the situation. 

Let x be the number of pictures in each album (excluding the one with 10 pictures).

We know that the total number of pictures uploaded by Isabel is 25. Some of them (10) were put into one album, and the remaining pictures (25 - 10 = 15) were distributed among the 5 different albums.

The number of pictures in the album with 10 pictures is 10, and the remaining pictures (15) are divided among the 5 other albums. Let y be the number of pictures in one of these albums. Then, the number of pictures in the other four albums is 4y (since they all have the same number of pictures).

Using these concepts, we have the following equations:

x * 5 = 15          (There are x pictures in each of the 5 other albums)
x + 10 + 5y = 25     (Total number of pictures = 10 in the first album + 5y pictures in the other 5 albums)

The solution to this system of equations is:

x = 3
y = 2

Substituting x and y into the equation for the number of pictures in one of the 5 other albums:

y = 2

So, each of the 5 other albums has 2 pictures. Since we already know that there are 10 pictures in the first album, that means the number of pictures in each album is:

Number of pictures in the first album = 10
Number of pictures in each of the other 5 albums = 2

Therefore, the final answer is:

Each album contains either 10 pictures (the first one) or 2 pictures.</s>",3

                    question:
                     Mike made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 26 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 5 dollar a week, how long would the money last him? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to find how much money Mike has in total (his earnings minus his expenses) and then determine how long this amount will last him at his weekly spending rate.

Let's call the total amount of money Mike has x dollars. 

We know that Mike made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 26 dollars weed eating. So, in total, he made 40 dollars ($14 + $26) for these jobs.

To find how long his money will last him, we need to find out how much he has in total and then determine how much money he spends per week. We are given that Mike spends 5 dollars a week on expenses.

Mike's total expenses for n weeks will be:

5 dollars per week x n weeks = 5n dollars

Mike's total earnings were 40 dollars, and he has some savings (let's call this amount z dollars), so:

Total amount of money with Mike = Earnings - Expenses + Savings

x = $40 - $5n + z

We don't know how many weeks the money will last him, so let's call this n. 

Now, let's solve for x in terms of n and z, and then determine what happens to n as we manipulate it in order to find the value of n.

x = $40 - $5n + z

If we're given that Mike spends 5 dollars a week, we can substitute this value for his expenses into the equation.

x = $40 - 5n + z

At this point, we don't know the exact value of n. Let's assume that n is a nonnegative integer.

Now, let's solve for x in terms of n and z by isolating x on one side of the equation.

x = $40 - 5n + z   

x - z = $40 - 5n    

Next, we'll divide both sides by -1 (changing the sign of the entire equation) to obtain:

-x - z = 5n - $40  

We can now use the quadratic formula to solve this equation for n, since the equation has the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = -1 and c = -(z + $40). But since a is negative, the graph of this quadratic function opens downward, which is not possible since our variable n is nonnegative. 

However, when z = 0, we get x - 5n = $40, which is a linear function in terms of n and x. This equation shows us that to find how long his money will last him, we can divide the amount of money he has ($x) by the amount of money he spends per week (-5).

$n = \dfrac{x}{-5}$

To determine how many weeks Mike's money will last him, let's set our initial guess to be 0 weeks. Our solution should give us either a real number or an error message. In order to calculate n, we can plug our values back into the equation:

x = $40 - 5(0) + z = z dollars

Since Mike only has expenses, z must be 0. Now, let's substitute x = 0 into the equation for n.

n = 0 (we start with 0 dollars, so we spent 0 weeks)

Let's check the reasonableness of our result: Mike should have run out of money after zero weeks, since we started with no dollars. However, knowing how long the money lasts is unlikely to be accurate in real life, as other expenses and income can affect the value of n. Therefore, we'll round up our answer to the nearest integer.

{The final answer is an integer between 0 and infinity, but the actual value is likely to be greater than zero}

So, Mike's money has not yet run out, and since we've found an integer value for n, we know that at this point, Mike is just starting to spend the money he earned from mowing and weed eating.

We've found a practical application for our algebra skills by creating a real-life scenario and showing how algebra can help us solve it.</s>",8

To find the number of files still on Vanessa's flash drive, we need to subtract the number of files she deleted from the original total number of files she had.

First, let's identify the total number of files Vanessa had on her flash drive before deleting any:

1. Music files: 16
2. Video files: 48
3. Total files: (16 music files) + (48 video files) = 64 files (in total)

Next, we know Vanessa deleted 30 files in total from her flash drive, meaning the remaining files left on her flash drive are the original number of files left minus the number of files she deleted.

In other words:

1. Total files before deleting (64): The number of files on her flash drive after deleting (N) = (Total files before deleting) - (Number of files deleted)
2. N = 64 - 30
3. N = 34 files

So, once all files have been deleted, Vanessa will have 34 files remaining (34 = 16 music files + 18 video files).

In other words, {The final number of files on Vanessa's flash drive is 34} after she deleted 30 files (a mixture of music and video files).</s>",34

To solve this problem, we first find the total number of shirts that Dave had to wash before school:

9 short sleeve shirts + 27 long sleeve shirts = 36 total shirts

Next, we find the number of shirts that Dave had already washed before school:

20 total shirts washed before school = 9 short sleeve shirts washed before school + (27 long sleeve shirts / 3) long sleeve shirts washed before school (assuming that shorter sleeve shirts were washed at a faster rate than longer sleeve shirts)

We can set up a system of equations and solve using algebra:

9 x short sleeve shirts washed before school + (27 / 3) x long sleeve shirts washed before school = 20

Alternatively, we can set up a simple subtraction problem:

36 total shirts - 20 already washed shirts = number of shirts not yet washed

Substitute the value we found for the already washed shirts into our second equation:

36 - 20 = number of shirts not yet washed

16 shirts have not yet been washed {The final answer is}.</s>",16

To find out how long it will take the chef to cook the remaining 2 potatoes (after cooking 7), we can subtract the number of potatoes he has already cooked (7) from the total number of potatoes he needs to cook (9) to get the number of potatoes left to cook (2). Let's call this time required to cook the remaining 2 potatoes x.

The chef takes 3 minutes to cook each potato, so the total time taken to cook all 7 potatoes is:

7 * 3 minutes = 21 minutes

The chef has already cooked the first 7 potatoes, so the time he has already spent cooking is 21 minutes. The remainder of the time he needs to spend cooking the remaining 2 potatoes is x.

Total time taken to cook all 9 potatoes = cooking time of first 7 potatoes + cooking time of remaining 2 potatoes (i.e., cooking time for all 9 potatoes)
                                             = 21 minutes + x minutes = XX min

The final answer is XX minutes, where XX is the time required to cook the remaining 2 potatoes. Substituting the values in the diagram above, we get:

XX = XX - 21 (from the diagram)

          XX = x minutes - 21 minutes

          XX = x - 21     (remembering that x and XX are the same time, just represented differently)

Let's simplify this expression by adding 21 to both sides:

          XX + 21 = x

          XX' = x         (where XX' is the new variable name - simply adding 21 to the original variable name, XX)

Now we can solve for x:

           x = XX'

           Plugging in the given value of XX' (i.e., the total time taken to cook all 9 potatoes) to find x:

           x = 9 * 3 + 7 * 3 (calculating the total number of minutes required to cook all 9 potatoes, plus the number of minutes required to cook the first 7 potatoes)

           x = 27 + 21

           x = 48      (remembering that x represents the time required to cook the remaining 2 potatoes)

Therefore, the time required to cook the remaining 2 potatoes is 48 minutes.

Let's call the original number of puppies x.

When the 34 puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies at the shelter became (2 + 34) = 36.

Let's say it takes t number of days for all the puppies to be adopted.

At the end of day t, the number of puppies left at the shelter is (36 - (4 * t))

We know from the problem that this number should be equal to 0 (meaning all the puppies have been adopted). So:

0 = (36 - (4 * t)) 

Solving for t:

t = (36 / 4) = 9

The final answer is: it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted. {The final answer is: 9 days}</s>",9
" Will had 59 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 32 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 9 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads? ","<|user|>

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pieces of clothing that need to be washed: Will has 59 pieces of clothing.

2. Find out how many pieces will go in the first large load: Will puts 32 of the 59 pieces in the first load. The number of pieces in the first load is 32.

3. Calculate the remainder of pieces after taking out the first load: The number of pieces left after taking out the first load is 59 - 32, which is 27.

4. Divide the remainder by the number of smaller loads (9): To split the remaining 27 pieces in 9 equal loads, we need to find out how many pieces should be in each small load. There are 27 pieces remaining, and we need to divide them among 9 loads. To calculate the number of pieces in each small load, we need to find the quotient when 27 is divided by 9.

27 ÷ 9 = 3 pieces per small load.

5. Confirm the calculations: If there are 32 pieces in the first large load (as calculated), and there will be 3 pieces in each small load, and we know that there are 9 small loads, then we can add up the total number of pieces in the small loads and compare to the total number remaining:

3 * 9 = 27 (pieces in the small loads)

32 + 27 = 59 (total number of pieces washed)

In this way, we can see that our calculations are accurate, and we have found the correct number of pieces per small load, which is 3.

{The final answer is: Each of the small loads contains 3 pieces of clothing.}</s>",3

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of pieces of chocolate candy as x and the number of pieces of caramel candy as y.

Since Adam bought 2 boxes of chocolate candy, the number of pieces of chocolate candy is 2 times the number of pieces in each box:

x = 2 * 4 = 8

Also, since Adam bought 5 boxes of caramel candy, the total number of pieces of caramel candy is 5 times the number of pieces in each box:

y = 5 * 4 = 20

Now we know that the total number of pieces of candy is the sum of the number of pieces of chocolate candy and the number of pieces of caramel candy:

Total number of pieces = x + y

Substituting the values we found above, we get:

Total number of pieces = 8 + 20

Total number of pieces = 28

So, the final answer is:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find how many new books Victor bought, we need to determine how many books he has in total after buying new ones (since he also used some books). Let's represent the number of new adventure books and new mystery books he bought as x and y, respectively.

The number of total adventure books is the sum of the new adventure books and the used adventure books:

32 (number of purchased adventure books) - 16 (number of used adventure books) + x (number of new adventure books) = total adventure books

32 - 16 + x = total adventure books

Let's also calculate the total number of mystery books:

37 (number of purchased mystery books) - 16 (number of used mystery books) + y (number of new mystery books) = total mystery books

37 - 16 + y = total mystery books

Now, we have two equations with two unknowns x and y. We can set these equations equal to each other to find the relationship between x and y:

32 - 16 + x = total adventure books

37 - 16 + y = total mystery books

Subtracting the first equation from the second one gives:

(37 - 32) - 0 + y - x = 0

5 - y = x

Thus, we get:

y = x + 5 (since y is a new mystery book, it's a positive number)

Let's figure out x, the new adventure books bought. There are 16 used adventure books, and we have 32 purchased adventure books, so we have 16 remaining new adventure books:

x = 32 - 16 = 16 new adventure books

When we have x, we can get y by plugging x into the formula we derived earlier:

y = x + 5 = 16 + 5 = 21 new mystery books

Now, we can conclude the total number of new books bought by Victor is the sum of the new adventure books and new mystery books:

16 (new adventure books) + 21 (new mystery books) = 37 new books

Therefore, the total number of new books bought by Victor is 37, and we can write:

{The final answer is 37, which is the total number of new books bought by Victor at the schools book fair after using 16 books.}</s>",53

                     Maria picked 48 carrots from her garden. If she threw out 11 of them and then picked 15 more the next day, how many carrots would she have total? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's represent the number of carrots Maria had after first picking 48 with the variable x. This means that when she threw out 11 carrots, she was left with x - 11 carrots. On the second day, she picked an additional 15 carrots, so the total number of carrots she had at the end was (x - 11) + 15, or x - 6. Let's set up an equation to represent this:

x - 11 + 15 = x - 6

Next, combine like terms on the left-hand side:

x - 11 + 15 = x - 6

x - 6 = x - 6

At this point, we can see that both variables represent the same quantity (the total number of carrots Maria had), and they're equal, so they can be removed:

0 = 0

Since this equation is true, it doesn't actually provide any new information. However, we can use the original equation to find the value of x:

x - 11 + 15 = x - 6

x - 11 = x - 6 + 15

x - 11 = x + 9

x - x = -11 - 9

0 = -20

This won't give us a true equation, since we can't have negative numbers of carrots (or anything else), but we can work backwards from this equation to find out how many carrots Maria had after her initial pick:

x = -20 + 48

x = 28

So, Maria had 28 carrots after her first pick of 48. After throwing out 11 and then picking 15 more, she had (28 - 11) + 15, or 22 carrots.

To solve this problem, we can use the first principle of arithmetic, which is the law of addition. 

First, we can find the number of roses the florist had after selling 15 of her initial 50 roses:

50 - 15 = 35 roses

Next, we can find the number of roses the florist has after picking 21 more roses. Note that the original 35 roses are still in her inventory, so we need to add the 21 newly acquired ones:

35 + 21 = 56 roses

Thus, at this point the florist has a total of 56 roses.

To summarize, the number of roses the florist has after selling 15 and picking 21 more is:

Similarly, Isabel has 4 pages of reading homework with 5 problems on each page. So she has a total of 20 reading problems (4 pages times 5 problems per page).

Adding up the math and reading problems gives us the total number of problems Isabel has to complete:

There were 4 friends playing a video game online, and each friend had 3 lives, for a total of 12 lives between the 4 friends. When 5 more players joined the game, each with 3 lives, we can create a table to organize the information:

The total number of lives for the 5 new players is 15, because we have 5 players, each with 3 lives (15 lives in total for the new players).

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we follow these steps:

1. Let's represent Kaleb's initial amount of money as $12.
2. He spends $8 on a new game, so his remaining money is:
    $12 - $8 = $4
3. Kaleb can buy 2-dollar toys with this remaining $4.
4. Let's represent the number of 2-dollar toys he can buy with this money as x.
5. If each toy costs $2, then x toys cost $2x.
6. Kaleb has $4 left, which is also equal to the cost of x toys.
7. Therefore, $4 = $2x  (cost of x toys)
8. We can find the value of x by dividing both sides by 2:
    $x = \frac{4}{2} = 2$

<|assistant|>
Let's represent the amount of money Jerry has at any given time as x dollars. We know that Jerry made a total of 14 dollars mowing lawns and 31 dollars weed eating, for a total income of 45 dollars. Thus, at the beginning (when he received this money), he has x = 45 dollars.

The money he spends each week is a weekly expense of 5 dollars. The length of time for which x dollars last him is called the time period, T. During the first week, his balance decreases by 5 dollars, leaving him with x - 5 dollars. During the second week, his balance further decreases by another 5 dollars, leaving him with x - 10 dollars, and so on. We can create a table like this:

| Week | Balance |
|------|-----------|
| 1    | x - 5   |
| 2    | x - 10  |
| 3    | x - 15 |
| ...  | ...    |

Note that this table is infinite because the problem did not specify a maximum time period for Jerry's money to last.

At the end of week 1, we know that Jerry has spent 5 dollars, so his balance is now x - 5 dollars. We can calculate his balance at the end of week n using the same logic:

Balance after n weeks = x - 5n dollars

Let's find out how long it will take for Jerry to run out of money. In other words, let's find a value of n such that his balance at the end of week n is 0 dollars. We have:

0 dollars = x - 5n dollars

In order for the balance to be 0, n should be:

n = x / 5 dollars

{The final answer is}: The time period, T, for which x dollars last Jerry if he only spends 5 dollars a week is T = x / 5 dollars.

To find out how long Jerry's money would last him:

Substitute the values we have into the equation for x:

T = (14 + 31) / 5 dollars

T = 45 / 5 dollars

T = 9 weeks

{The final answer is}: It would take Jerry 9 weeks to run out of money if he spends 5 dollars a week and earns a total of 45 dollars.

Note: This problem assumes that Jerry earns a fixed salary each week, which is not entirely accurate. It's possible that he earns different amounts of money each week based on how many lawns and weeds he cleans. However, this simplistic model helps us understand how Jerry's spending and income affect his financial state.</s>",9

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Step 1: Adam had 33 books in total. We can represent this as:

Adam had 33 books.

Step 2: Adam sold 11 books. Let's represent the number of books he had left after selling them as x. The equation for the number of books he had after selling 11 is:

Original Number of Books (33) - Number of Books Sold (11) = New Number of Books (x)

33 - 11 = x

Step 3: Let's call the number of new books Adam bought with the money he earned from selling 11 books as y. The equation for the money he earned from selling 11 books is:

Number of Books Sold (11) x Price of Each Book = Amount Earned From Selling Books

The price of each book is not given, so let's assume it's $10. If we multiply the number of books sold and their price, we can determine how much money Adam earned:

11 x $10 = $110

Let's now find out how many new books Adam bought for this amount:

Amount Earned ($110) ÷ Price of Each New Book (let's assume it's $8) = Number of New Books (y)

110 ÷ $8 = y

13.8125 new books were bought with the money earned from selling 11 books. Let's round this number up to 14, as we can't have a fraction of a book.

Step 4: Adam now has the number of books he had left after selling 11, plus the new books he bought:

Number of Books After Selling 11 and Buying 14 New Ones (x + 14)

Let's find the value of x by using the equation we found earlier:

33 - 11 = x

22 = x

Step 5: Here's the completed problem:

Adam had 33 books. He sold 11 of them and used the money he earned to buy 14 new books, each for $8. How many books does Adam now have?

The final answer is: Adam now has 22 books, plus the 14 new books he bought, for a total of 36 books.

So, Adam has 36 books in total.

Alternate Solution:

Another way to solve this problem is to find how many books Adam earned from selling 11 books, then subtract the number of books sold from the original number of books, and finally add the number of new books bought to this new number.

Adam earned $110 from selling 11 books. 

Number of Books Sold (11) x Price of Each Book ($10) = Earned Amount ($110)

110 books were sold for a total of $110. We can reverse the equation to find out how many books cost $100:

Earned Amount ($100) ÷ Price of Each Book ($10) = Number of Books (n)

100 ÷ $10 = n

10 books would cost $100. Now, we know the number of books Adam sold was 11, and we already calculated that he earned $110 from selling them. Let's subtract the number of books sold from the original number of books to find the number of books Adam had left:

Original Number of Books (33) - Number of Books Sold (11) = Number of Books Left (x)

33 - 11 = x

We know that Adam earned $110 from selling 11 times $10 each, so we calculate how many books this $110 could buy:

Earned Amount ($110) ÷ Price of Each Book ($10) = Number of Books (m)

110 ÷ $10 = m

110 books could be bought for $1100. Let's add the number of new books Adam bought to the number of books he still had and then find the total number of books Adam has:

Number of Books Left (x) + Number of New Books (14) = Total Number of Books (z)

                     Kaleb was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday he filled 5 bags up and on Sunday he filled 5 more bags. If each bag had 4 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find the total number of cans Kaleb picked up, we need to determine how many cans were in his bags on Saturday and how many cans were in his bags on Sunday.

Let's call the number of cans in a bag on Saturday ""x."" Then, we know that x goes into 5 bags with a remainder of 0, since we filled all 5 bags. 

x bags each containing 4 cans = 5 × 4 = 20 cans

So, using the equation for equivalent ratios, we know that 4 is equivalent to x, and 5 is equivalent to 5. We can set up the equation:

4 = x / 5

Then, we can cross-multiply and get:

4 × 5 = x × 4

20 = 4x

5 = x / 4

5 bags each containing x cans on Saturday = x × 5 = 25 cans

Now we know that Kaleb filled 5 bags with a total of 25 cans on Saturday. 

Next, let's calculate how many cans Kaleb picked up on Sunday. We know that the number of cans in each bag was 4, and that we filled 5 bags.

5 bags each containing 4 cans = 5 × 4 = 20 cans

On Sunday, Kaleb filled 5 more bags (10 bags total) with 4 cans each:

10 bags each containing 4 cans = 10 × 4 = 40 cans

Total number of cans picked up from Saturday and Sunday:

25 cans picked up on Saturday
40 cans picked up on Sunday

Total number of cans picked up:

25 + 40 = 65 cans

{The final answer is: Kaleb picked up a total of 65 cans.}</s>",40

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here's the step-by-step solving process:

1. First, let's determine how many books are on each of the mystery and picture book shelves.
   - Mystery books: There are 2 shelves with this type of book, and each shelf has 6 books (as per the problem). So, in total, we have 12 books (2 shelves with 6 books each) of the mystery genre.
   - Picture books: Each picture book shelf has exactly 6 books, and there are 6 such shelves. So, in total, we have 36 (6 shelves with 6 books each) picture books.
2. Now, let's add up the total number of books that Nancy has:
   - Mystery books: We've already calculated 12 books.
   - Picture books: We have 36 books of this type.
   - Therefore, the total number of books is 48 (12 mystery + 36 picture).
3. Our final answer is:
   {The final answer is} 48

In conclusion, Nancy has a total of 48 books on her bookcase, with 12 of those being mystery books and 36 being picture books.</s>",48
" Paul had saved up 3 dollars. If he received another 7 dollars for his allowance, how many 5 dollar toys could he buy? ","<|user|>

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Paul had saved up 3 dollars. If he received another 7 dollars for his allowance, how many 5 dollar toys could he buy? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we follow these steps:

1. Paul had saved up $3. {The initial amount Paul had is $3.}

2. Paul received another $7 for his allowance, adding up to a total of $10. {Now Paul's total amount is $10.}

3. We divide the amount Paul can spend on each toy (i.e., $5) by the amount he has left (i.e., $10 - $5 per toy) to find out how many toys he can buy. This is called finding out the ""quota"" or ""rate."" {For calculating quota, we divide the cost price of one toy ($5) by the remaining money we have after buying the first toy ($10 - $5).}

4. Let x be the number of toys Paul can buy with the remaining money. {We don't know the exact value of x yet, so we represent it by a variable 'x'.}

5. Now we calculate the quota (q) using the two-step method. In the first step, we divide the cost price of one toy ($5) by the number of toys we want to buy (1). In the second step, we divide the money Paul has left after buying the first toy ($10 - $5) by the quota (q) per toy.

6. Quota (q) = (Cost price of one toy) / (Number of toys)

   q = $5 / 1

   q = 5

   Quota (q) per toy is $5.

7. Unknowns (x, q) = Knowns (Cost price of one toy, Amount left)

   x toys can be bought with q dollars per toy.

   x dollars are left when buying x toys.

   x dollars for toys + $x dollars for toys + $10 dollars for total = $10 dollars Paul has in total.

   $10 = $x + $x + $10

   $10 = 2 * $x

   $x = $10 / 2

8. Now we substitute the quota value of 5 from Step 6 in the quota equation from Step 5, and get:

   x toys can be bought with 5 dollars per toy.

   $10 dollars are left when buying x toys.

   x * 5 dollars for toys + $10 dollars for the total = $10 dollars Paul has in total.

   $10 = 5 * x + $10

   $10 - $10 = 5 * x

   $0 = 5 * x

   This does not make sense as the value of x should not be zero. So, we have an error in our model. This is called a ""zero divisor error"" in algebra. This arises when we divide something (in our case $10 - $5 per toy) by zero (in this case x = 0). At this point, we should check what went wrong in our thought process and revisit the problem to determine if we made a mistake. Let's check the original statement by Paul.

9. Could we have misunderstood Paul's statement? Let's recheck the problem description. Paul said that he saved up ""3 dollars"" and after receiving ""another 7 dollars,"" he has ""10 dollars in total."" So, if he saved up $3 in total, and received $7 more, how could he have spent $9 on toys? This does not make sense either. So, Paul most likely stated his savings after buying the toys, and the actual savings he had before buying the toys were lower than what he had.

10. Since the savings he had are lower than $3, the actual savings he had before buying the toys are somewhere between $0 and $3.

11. Let's assume that Paul's actual savings before buying the toys are $x.

12. After buying $x / 5 dollars' worth of toys, he had $10 - $x / 5 dollars left.

13. Let's say that he received $7$ more.

14. So, his total savings and received amount are $x + $7.

15. Let's calculate the quota again as we did before, starting from Step 5.

16. Q = $5 / 1

Step 1: Wendy had 43 lives before losing any in the hard part of the game. {The final answer is 43.}

Step 2: In the hard part of the game, Wendy lost 8 lives. We can subtract 8 from 43 to find how many lives she had left after the hard part:

43 - 8 = 35

Step 3: Later on, Wendy gained 39 more lives in the next level. We can add 39 to the number of lives remaining after the hard part to find her total number of lives now:

Putting it all together, after gaining 39 more lives, Wendy has a total of 74 lives.

To determine how much money Will made in the two days, we need to find his earnings on each day and then add them up. Let's follow the steps below:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here's the step-by-step solution:

First, we know that Carol made a total of 19 cupcakes originally. She sold 6 of them, leaving 13 (19-6) remaining.

So, we can represent this situation with an equation:

C = 19      C is the total number of cupcakes made by Carol
x = 6     x is the number of cupcakes sold
y = C - x The remaining number of cupcakes at the end of the first stage

Now, Carol made 27 more cupcakes after selling the initial 6. So, let's call the new total number of cupcakes w (w is the total number of cupcakes after making 27 more).

We can represent this in an equation:

w = y + 27

Combining the first two equations, we get:

C = y + x
y = C - x

Substituting the second equation for y in the third equation, we get the total number of cupcakes w in terms of the number of cupcakes Carol made, C, and the number of cupcakes she sold, x.

w = C - (C - x) + 27

Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:

w = 2x + 27

Thus, Carol's final number of cupcakes should be:

{The final answer is} w = 2x + 27

We could, of course, find w (the final number of cupcakes) by substituting the values we have for x and C into this equation. But without knowing C and x, we don't know the final answer.

In other words, the equation we found shows how w (the number of cupcakes at the end) depends on C (the total number Carol made) and x (the number she sold). To find the actual number, we need to know C and x.</s>",40

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Step 1: Calculate the number of remaining team members after 7 did not show up.

14 total team members - 7 who did not show up = 7 team members who did show up

7 team members who did show up = x (total number of points scored by team members who showed up) / 5 (points scored per team member)

x = 5 (points scored per team member) * 7 (number of team members who showed up) = 35 points scored by team members who showed up

Step 2: Calculate the total number of points scored by both showing and non-showing team members.

1. Points scored by showing team members: 35 points as calculated in Step 1

2. Points scored by non-showing team members (0 points as they did not show up): 0 points

Total points scored by all team members (showing and non-showing): 35 points (from Step 1) + 0 points (from non-showing team members) = 35 points total

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's represent the original number of team members as n, and the number of team members who showed up as x. We know that n = 5 and x = 3 (since 2 members didn't show up).

Each team member who showed up scored 6 points. So, the total number of points scored by the team members who showed up is 6 times the number of team members who showed up: 6x.

The original team also had n-x team members who didn't show up and didn't contribute to the score. However, since we're only concerned with the points scored during the game, we can ignore this factor and focus on the team members who did show up. Therefore, the total number of points scored during the game is the sum of the points scored by the team members who showed up: 6x.

To find out how many points were scored total, we also need to take into account the points scored by the two team members who didn't show up. Let's call them A and B, and let their scores be a and b, respectively.

The total number of points scored during the game, and therefore the total number of points scored so far, is the sum of the points scored by the team members who showed up and the points scored by A and B: (6x) + a + b.

Now let's find out how many points A and B could have scored. Since they didn't show up, their scores could have been any non-negative number. Let's call their potential scores p and q, respectively.

If A and B showed up, they would have scored p and q points, respectively. However, since they didn't come, those points are missing. Therefore, to find out how many points were scored total, we have to add those missed points to the points scored by the team members who did show up: (6x) + a + b + p + q.

Since we're only concerned with the points scored in the game, let's ignore the potential scores p and q of team members A and B. Instead, let's say p and q could have been any non-negative numbers, but they weren't included in the score. So, the total number of points scored during the game, and therefore the total number of points scored so far, is (6x) + a + b.

However, since we're interested in the total number of points scored, let's not stop here - we also need to consider the potential scores p and q of team members A and B. So, the total number of points scored is the sum of the points scored by the team members who did show up during the game, plus the potential scores of team members A and B: (6x) + a + b + p + q = Total number of points scored.

The final answer is: The total number of points scored is (6x) + a + b + p + q = Total number of points scored. {The final answer is: Total number of points scored = (6 x 3) + 0 + 0 + p + q = 18 + p + q} (since all those team members who didn't show up, A and B, didn't score any points during the game, and their potential scores p and q are also 0.) 


{Note: In the above final answer, you may think that we need more information to determine the potential scores p and q of team members A and B, which are not available here. That's true, but we've ignored them throughout the problem, and in our final answer we're making an assumption that those potential scores p and q could have been any non-negative number. It's highly unlikely that those potential scores were so high as to influence the final score, since those team members who didn't show up had already missed the game, and hence most probably weren't even planning on scoring points in that particular game. However, let's give them the benefit of doubt. If we think that they might have scored certain points, we can add those potential scores to the final answer, and if we think that they might not have scored any points, we'll leave them 0. That's why we'll leave p and q as unknowns, and just add them to our final answer, knowing full well that they're almost certain to be 0, irrespective of what their actual scores would have been.}

                     Oliver is at the library helping put away books. There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's call the number of shelves Oliver needs ""x"". We know that there are 46 books to put away, and 10 of them were taken by the librarian. So, the number of books left for Oliver is 46 - 10, or 36. We also know that Oliver can fit 4 books on one shelf, so the total number of books on each shelf is 4.

Now, let's find out how many books will be on each shelf. Since Oliver can place 4 books on each shelf, and there are x shelves, there will be 4 * x books on all the shelves combined. Since Oliver left with 36 books, the number of books on all the shelves cannot be greater than 36. Therefore, 4 * x ≤ 36. 

We can also find out how many books are on each shelf when the librarian takes 10 books out of the total 46 books. After the librarian takes out 10 books, there remain 36 books, so there would be 36/x number of shelves. Each shelf would have 10 books left by the librarian, and also 4 - 10 = 3 books for each of the remaining books, so on each shelf, there would be 3 * 36/x + 10 books. We can find out how many books would be on each shelf as follows:

(3 * 36/x) + 10 = 46
3 * 36/x = 36 - 10
3 * 36/x = 26

Solving for x:
x = 3 * 36 / 26
x = 27

Since x cannot be a decimal because libraries do not use fractional shelves, we round up to the next highest integer, which is 28 shelves.

So, Oliver would need 28 shelves to put away the remaining 36 books after the librarian took out 10 books.

The final answer is: Oliver would need 28 shelves to put away the remaining books after the librarian took out 10 books.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first count the number of quarters Luke had in total. Each pile of quarters had 3 coins, and he had a total of 5 such piles. So, in total, Luke had 5 * 3 = 15 quarters.

Next, we need to count the number of dimes Luke had in total. Each pile of dimes had 3 coins, and Luke had 5 such piles. So, in total, Luke had 5 * 3 = 15 dimes.

We have already counted some of Luke's coins twice, as he had both quarters and dimes in each pile. To find the total number of coins, we need to account for this double-counting.

First, we can find the total number of coins that were doubled-counted. As each pile had 3 coins, and there were 5 such piles, a total of 15 coins were doubled-counted between the quarters and dimes.

Next, we can remove the double-counted coins from both the quarters and dimes calculations. Since we over-counted by 15 coins, we need to subtract 15 from our totals for both quarters and dimes. This gives us:

- Total number of quarters: 15 (as we have already counted these)
- Total number of dimes: 15 (as we have already counted these)
- Number of coins doubled-counted: -15 (as we now know we have too many)

Adding these up, we see that the total number of coins Luke had is:

- Total number of coins: 15 + 15 - 15 = 15

<|assistant|>
Step 1: Determine how many points Gwen earns for recycling paper
- For every 3 pounds of paper recycled, Gwen earns 1 point
- Let's say Gwen recycled x pounds of paper
- To calculate the number of points Gwen earns, we can set up a ratio to represent this relation
  - 3 pounds : 1 point
- Let's establish an expression for Gwen's points using this relation
  - x pounds / 3 pounds = 1 point
- We can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to change pounds to points
  - x pounds / 3 pounds = 1 point
  - 3 x = 3 points
- Gwen earns 3 points for every pound of paper recycled

Step 2: Calculate the number of points Gwen earned from recycling 5 pounds
- Gwen recycled 5 pounds
- Using the expression we found in Step 1, we can calculate the number of points she earned
- 5 pounds = 5 / 3 points
- 1 pound = 1 / 3 points
- After making these equivalences, we get:
  - 5 pounds = 5 x 1 / 3 points
  - Gwen earns 5 points for recycling 5 pounds

Step 3: Determine how many points Gwen's friends earn for recycling paper
- Gwen's friends recycled 13 pounds
- Using the same steps, we can calculate the number of points they earned
- 13 pounds = 4.333333333333333333 points (Since we can't recycle fractions of pounds)
- But since we want to calculate points exactly, let's round up to the nearest integer
- 13 pounds = 14 points

Step 4: Calculate the total number of points earned by Gwen and her friends
- Gwen earned 5 points
- Gwen's friends earned 14 points
- Let's calculate the total points earned:
  - 5 Gwen points + 14 friends points = 19 points in total

                    question:
                     Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's first determine how much each of Haley's tickets costs. Since she bought 3 tickets, we can set up an equation where the cost of each ticket is represented by x, and we know that 3 times x (or 3x) equals 4 dollars.

3x = 4

Next, let's calculate how much the tickets for her friends cost. Since there is no explicit value provided for these tickets, let's represent the cost of each ticket for her friends with y.

The total cost of 3 tickets for herself and her friends is 3y.

Now let's calculate the cost of the extra 5 tickets. Again, let's represent the cost of each ticket as z. The total cost of the 5 extra tickets is 5z.

Adding these costs together, we can find the total cost for Haley.

Total cost = 3y + 5z

Now, we need to find the values for y and z. First, let's address the fact that these values are unknown but that we know the costs for all the tickets. This means that the sum of the costs for Haley's own tickets, her friends' tickets, and the extra tickets must equal the total cost for Haley. Let's represent the total cost for Haley as t.

3x + 3y + 5z = t

We know that x, y, and z are all dollar values and that the dollar amounts must be positive. Let's also set up our reasoning this way so that we can easily add up all the dollar values.

3(4) + 3y + 5z = t

12 + 3y + 5z = t

Next, let's find the value of y. We can set up an equation where y is expressed as x value to make it easier to see the relationship.

y = 0.25x

Now let's substitute this value into our equation where y is unknown.

12 + 3(0.25x) + 5z = t

4.5x + 5z = t

Lastly, let's determine the value of z. We can set up an equation where z is unknown and find its value as a function of x.

12 + 3(4) + 5z = t

z = (t - 24) / 20

Since x, y, and z have all been expressed in terms of x, we can find the relationship between all three values and identify the value of the total cost t.

Total cost = 3(4) + 3(0.25x) + 5((t - 24) / 20)

Let's substitute the value for y into our expression for the total cost.

Total cost = 12 + 0.75x + (5/20)(t - 24)

We can see that there is a relationship between t and x. We know that t is our total cost for Haley. We also know that this total cost is made up of three portions: the cost of her own tickets, her friends' tickets, and the extra tickets. Since we know that the first portion is constant (12), we can rearrange the terms of the expression to identify t as a function of x.

t = 24 + 14x

Now let's find the values for all three tickets.

Her own ticket cost:

Each of her three tickets costs $4, so the total cost for her own tickets is 12 dollars.

Her friends' ticket cost:

Since we know that each friend's ticket is 0.25 of the cost of one of her tickets, we can find the cost for all tickets bought by her friends together by finding the product of the price per ticket ($4) and the number of tickets. Since each of her friends pays 0.25 of the cost of her ticket, and she bought tickets for three friends, we can set up an equation where y is the number of tickets bought by her friends and z is the price per ticket for them.

3(0.25x) = 0.75xy

Next, let's find the value of y. Since we know that the total cost (t) for her friends' tickets can be found by multiplying the price per friend's ticket (y) by the number of friends",32

<|assistant|>
Let's call the initial amount of money George had x dollars.

When George received his birthday money, the total amount he had became x + 16 dollars.

Next, George spent 38 dollars on a new game. After the purchase, the remaining money in George's possession was x + 16 - 38 dollars.

We can write this as an equation:

x + 16 - 38 = y (where y is the amount of money George has now)

Simplifying, we have:

x - 22 = y

The final answer is: George has y dollars now. {The final answer is: George has y dollars now.}

To find the exact value of y, we can substitute the value of x:

x - 22 = y

But we know that x was the initial amount of money George had, which was 30 dollars. Therefore:

30 - 22 = y

Now we can finally write the full answer to the question:

George has 8 dollars now. {The final answer is: George has 8 dollars now.}</s>",8

<|assistant|>
Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many parrots are in all the bird cages. Since there are 4 cages, and each cage has 8 parrots, we can calculate the total number of parrots as:

   Number of parrots = 8 parrots per cage × 4 cages
   Number of parrots = 32 parrots in total

2. Similarly, we can find out how many parakeets are in all the bird cages:

   Number of parakeets = 2 parakeets per cage × 4 cages
   Number of parakeets = 8 parakeets in total

3. To find out the total number of birds in the pet store, we add the number of parrots and parakeets we found in Steps 1 and 2:

   Total number of birds = Number of parrots + Number of parakeets
   Total number of birds = 32 parrots + 8 parakeets
   Total number of birds = 40 birds in total

4. So, the final answer is:

   {The final answer is:} 40

In words, the pet store has 40 birds in total, with 32 parrots and 8 parakeets in the 4 bird cages.</s>",40

Step 1: Determine how many pieces are in all 14 boxes.
1 fourth (14) of the boxes contain 5 pieces each. This represents 5 boxes.
13 fourths (13) of the boxes contain 6 pieces each. This represents 84 pieces in the remaining 9 boxes.
Total pieces in all 14 boxes = 5 * 5 + 84 = 50

Step 2: Find how many pieces Kaleb still has after giving 5 boxes to his brother.
Kaleb still has 9 boxes, because he gave 5 to his brother.
Number of pieces in the 9 remaining boxes is 9 * 6 = 54.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to first calculate how many pictures are left over after Robin has uploaded all 36 pictures (31 from her phone and 5 from her camera) to Facebook. Let's call this number of leftover pictures x.

31 pictures from Robin's phone and 5 pictures from her camera add up to 36 pictures. Let x be the number of pictures from her Facebook upload that were not put into the albums.

31 + 5 = 36  (number of pictures from phone and camera)
36 = 31 + x   (number of pictures from Facebook is equal to number of pictures from phone + camera, minus the number of pictures in the albums)

x can be found by subtracting 31 and 5 from 36.

x = 36 - 31 - 5
x = 0

This means that Robin uploaded all 36 pictures to Facebook, and there are no pictures left over.

For each album, Robin wants to put the same amount of pictures. Since she has 9 different albums, let's call the number of pictures in each album a.

The total number of pictures in all 9 albums is 9a.

36 = 9a  (total number of pictures = number of pictures in each album times the number of albums)

Finally we can calculate the value of a.

a = 36 / 9
a = 4

In each of the 9 albums, there are 4 pictures.

{The final answer is 4 pictures in each of the 9 albums.}</s>",4

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Let's find out how much money Mike has left after buying new mower blades.
   - He earned $69 in total for mowing lawns.
   - He spent $24 on new mower blades.
   - So, $69 - $24 = $45 is the money Mike has left.

2. We want to find out how many $5 games Mike can buy with this leftover money.
   - The price of one game is $5.
   - In order to calculate how many games he can buy, we need to figure out how many $5 purchases he can make with $45.
   - $45 can be written as 9 times $5 (because $45 ÷ $5 = 9), since we can break down $45 into nine $5 games.
   - So, Mike can buy 9 $5 games with the remaining money.

<|assistant|>
To find the total number of minutes it took Maria to finish putting together all of her new furniture, we need to add up the number of minutes it took her to put together each piece. Here's how we can do that:

1. Maria bought 2 new chairs. Let's say it took her x number of minutes to put each chair together. Since she bought 2 chairs, we can represent the number of minutes it took her to put both chairs together as 2x.
2. Maria also bought 2 new tables. It took her y number of minutes to put each table together. So, we can represent the number of minutes it took her to put both tables together as 2y.
3. In total, Maria spent 8 minutes putting together each piece of furniture. So, for every chair and every table, we can represent this as 8 minutes.
4. Using the information we have, we can write an equation that represents the total number of minutes it took Maria to finish putting together all of her new furniture:

Total number of minutes = Number of minutes it took to put chairs together + Number of minutes it took to put tables together

Substituting our representations from steps 1 and 2, we can set this up algebraically as follows:

Total number of minutes = 2x + 2y

<|assistant|>
To find out how many baggies Maria can make with 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies, we first need to see how many cookies are in each bag. Since there are 8 cookies in each bag, we can calculate the number of bags needed for each type of cookie:

- For chocolate chip cookies:
    - We know that there are 5 chocolate chip cookies.
    - Each bag contains 8 chocolate chip cookies.
    - To find the number of bags needed, we can divide the number of cookies by the number of cookies in each bag:
      5 chocolate chip cookies ÷ 8 chocolate chip cookies per bag = 0.625 bags.
    - Since we cannot make a fraction of a bag, we'll round this down to 0 bags.
- For oatmeal cookies:
    - We know that there are 19 oatmeal cookies.
    - Each bag contains 8 oatmeal cookies.
    - To find the number of bags needed, we can divide the number of cookies by the number of cookies in each bag:
      19 oatmeal cookies ÷ 8 oatmeal cookies per bag = 2.375 bags.
    - Again, since we cannot make a fraction of a bag, we'll round this down to 2 bags.

In total, Maria can fill 0 chocolate chip cookie bags and 2 oatmeal cookie bags, for a total of 2 bags in total. We'll check our answer now:

- If there were no chocolate chip cookies, Maria could fill 2 oatmeal cookie bags (each containing 8 cookies), making a total of 16 cookies. In reality, she has an extra 3 cookies (19 oatmeal cookies - 16 cookies).
- If there were no oatmeal cookies, Maria could fill 0 bags, leaving her with the 5 chocolate chip cookies she has.

So, our answer seems correct! {Maria can make a total of 2 bags with 8 cookies each, for a total of 16 cookies (14 oatmeal cookies and 2 chocolate chip cookies).}</s>",3

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of books Bianca has, given the information provided.

Let's say there are x mystery books and y picture books in total. Since Bianca has 5 shelves of mystery books and each shelf has 8 books, we can write an equation for the number of mystery books as:

5 * 8 = x

Similarly, since Bianca has 4 shelves of picture books and each shelf has 8 books, we can write an equation for the number of picture books as:

4 * 8 = y

Let's add the two equations together to get the total number of books:

x + y = 5 * 8 + 4 * 8

We can substitute the values of x and y in terms of the number of books they represent, and simplify:

x + y = 40

However, we have already found formulas for x and y in terms of the total number of mystery and picture books:

5 * 8 = x

4 * 8 = y

Substituting these formulas into our equation for the total number of books, we get:

5 * 8 = x

4 * 8 = y

x + y = 40

80 = x + y

Let's subtract the equation for y (4 * 8 = y) from the equation for the total number of books:

80 = x + y

y = 4 * 8

y - (4 * 8) = x - (5 * 8)

4 * 8 - (4 * 8) = 5 * 8 - x

0 = 8 * (5 - 1)

We set this equation to zero because we don't have enough information to solve for x specifically. However, we do know that the product of the difference between the numbers of mystery and picture books, and 8 is zero. This implies that either (5 - 1) = 0, which is a contradiction, or both (5 - 1) and x are equal to zero. But x cannot equal zero because we were given the information that each shelf has exactly 8 books, so either the number of mystery books is less than 8 (which contradicts that each shelf has exactly 8), or there are some leftover mystery books that are not on any shelf, which can't happen under our given conditions. This means that (5 - 1) must not equal zero, so we can conclude that the numbers of mystery books (x) and picture books (y) are both equal to 40.

Let's substitute this back into our original equations to double-check:

5 * 8 = x = 40

4 * 8 = y = 40

So it's clear that Bianca has a total of 80 books (40 mystery books and 40 picture books), exactly 8 books per shelf.

The final answer is: Bianca has a total of 80 books, exactly 8 books per shelf.

{The final answer is: Bianca has a total of 80 books, exactly 8 books per shelf.}</s>",72

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cards John has.

We know that John has 8 new cards and 16 old cards. In total, he has 8 new cards and 16 old cards, making a total of 24 cards (8 new cards + 16 old cards).

Step 2: Calculate the number of cards on each page.

We know that there are 3 cards on each page.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pages required to hold all the cards.

To find the number of pages required, we need to divide the total number of cards by the number of cards on each page.

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find out how much flour Isabel still needs, we need to determine the total amount of flour she's already used (3 brownies times 5 cups of flour per brownie) and the total amount of flour she needs for the remaining two brownies.

Total amount of flour used so far: 3 brownies times 5 cups of flour per brownie = 15 cups

The number of brownies Isabel still needs to bake is the difference between the total number of brownies she needs for her party and the number she has already baked: 5 brownies total needed - 3 brownies already baked = 2 more brownies needed.

Each of these brownies requires 5 cups of flour, so the amount of flour she will need for the two remaining brownies is: 2 brownies times 5 cups of flour per brownie = 10 cups

So, the total amount of flour Isabel already has (15 cups) plus the amount of flour she still needs for the two remaining brownies (10 cups) is the total amount of flour she needs for the party: 15 cups already used + 10 cups needed for the remaining brownies = 25 cups of flour in total.

Now, we compare this final answer with the initial description of how much flour Isabel needs in total: she needs 5 brownies times 5 cups of flour per brownie, which is 25 cups of flour. Since our calculated total exactly matches this, we can be confident that our steps were correct.

{The final answer is 25 cups of flour in total}.</s>",10

   {The first answer is: x1 = 19}
2. Out of these 19 cupcakes, Maria sold 5 and has 14 left. Let's denote the number of cupcakes sold as x2.
   {The second answer is: x2 = 5}
   {Subsequently, 14 is the remaining cupcakes which is x1 - x2}
3. After selling these 5 cupcakes, Maria made another 10 cupcakes. Let's denote this as x3.
   {The third answer is: x3 = 10}
4. Now, Maria has a total number of cupcakes, which is the sum of what she had initially and the cupcakes she made after selling the first 5.
   {The fourth answer is: Total cupcakes = x1 + x3}
5. When we substitute the values of x1, x2, and x3 into the total cupcakes, we get:
   {The final answer is: Total cupcakes = 19 + 10 = 29}
6. Subtracing the number of cupcakes she sold (x2) from the total cupcakes, we get the number of cupcakes she has at the end.
   {The final answer is: Remaining cupcakes = Total cupcakes - x2 = 29 - 5 = 24}
   {Alternatively, we can sum up the initial cupcakes and the cupcakes she made, the former being x1 and the latter being x3, after deducting the 5 sold cupcakes: Remaining cupcakes = x1 + x3 - x2 = 19 + 10 - 5 = 24}
   {The answer can be: Maria has a total of 24 cupcakes left after the school bake sale.}</s>",24

1. Let's start by listing out the information we have:
   a. Tom bought a total of 40 tickets at the state fair.
   b. Tom spent 28 tickets at the ""dunk a clown"" booth.
   c. There were still some tickets left over, which Tom decided to use on rides.
   d. Each ride cost 4 tickets.

2. Now, let's find out how many tickets Tom had left over after spending 28 tickets at the ""dunk a clown"" booth:
   a. We can represent this as an equation:
   b. 40 (the total number of tickets) minus 28 (the number of tickets spent at the ""dunk a clown"" booth) equals the number of tickets left over:
   c. 40 - 28 = x (where x represents the number of tickets left over)
   d. x = 12

3. Next, we can find out how many rides Tom could go on using the remaining 12 tickets:
   a. We know that each ride costs 4 tickets.
   b. Let's represent this as an equation:
   c. x (the number of rides) multiplied by 4 (the cost of each ride) equals the number of tickets used on rides:
   d. x × 4 = 12 (the number of tickets left over)
   e. By solving for x, we can find out how many rides Tom could go on:
   f. x = 3 (the number of rides)

4. So, Tom could go on 3 rides using the remaining 12 tickets.

{The final answer is: Tom could go on 3 rides using the remaining tickets he had left over after buying 28 tickets at the ""dunk a clown"" booth and 12 tickets at the ride booth, where each ride cost 4 tickets.}</s>",3
 In fourth grade there were 31 students at the start of the year. During the year 5 students left and 11 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end? ,"<|user|>

<|assistant|>
1. At the start of the fourth grade, there were 31 students.
2. During the year, 5 students left the fourth grade. This means that the number of students decreased by 5.
3. Let x be the number of students in the fourth grade at the end of the year. We can set up an equation to represent the change in the number of students using the formula:
change in number of students = beginning number of students - final number of students, which simplifies to:
final number of students - beginning number of students = change in number of students
x - 31 = -5
4. Next, we need to find the number of new students who joined the fourth grade during the year. Let y be the number of new students. Then, we know that y new students joined, and 11 of them joined the fourth grade. We can set up another equation to represent the number of new students:
y new students joined school = 11 students joined fourth grade
y = 11
5. Now, let's find the total number of students in the fourth grade at the end of the year. Before finding this number, let's simplify our equation for x. We know that x - 31 = -5. To change the sign of the 31, we add it to both sides:
x - 31 + 31 = -5 + 31
x = 26
This means that when we subtract 31 from x, we get -5, but when we add 31 back, we get our original x value. This is known as an offset.
6. Let's find the total number of students in the fourth grade now that we know the final number of students, x, and the number of new students, y.
total number of students in fourth grade at the end = final number of students + new students
31 - 5 + 11 = x + y
26 + 11 = x + 11
15 = x

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Let's find how many green towels Maria has after buying them.
   - Maria bought 35 green towels.
2. Let's find how many white towels Maria has after buying them.
   - Maria bought 21 white towels.
3. Let's find how many towels (both green and white) Maria gave to her mother.
   - Maria gave her mother 34 towels. We don't know how many of them are green and how many are white, so let's proceed with all possible scenarios.
   - Scenario 1: All 34 towels are green.
     - In this scenario, after giving away the green towels, Maria has 35 - 34 = 1 green towel remaining.
     - In this scenario, Maria's final number of towels is the same as the number of green towels, which is 1.
   - Scenario 2: All 34 towels are white.
     - In this scenario, after giving away the white towels, Maria has 21 - 34 = -13 white towels remaining. Clearly, this is impossible, as we cannot have a negative number of towels. We do not need to continue with this scenario.
   - Scenario 3: Some green towels and some white towels were given to her mother.
     - After giving away some green and white towels, Maria has (35 - X) green towels and (21 - Y) white towels remaining, where X and Y are the numbers of green and white towels, respectively, that Maria gave to her mother.
     - In this scenario, we need to find the number of green and white towels Maria gave to her mother.
     - Let's find the number of green towels (X).
       - We know that Maria gave 34 towels, some of which were green.
       - Let's find how many of those towels were green.
       - We have 35 green towels remaining, and some of them were given to her mother.
       - Let's find the difference between the number of green towels given to her mother (X) and the number of green towels remaining (35 - X).
       - 35 - X = X (simplify X - X)
       - Solving for X:
       - X = 0 or X = 70
       - Rejection of X = 70:
       - If X is 70, then -13 (the remaining number of white towels) is negative, which we can't have.
       - Final number of green towels:
       - 35 - 0 = 35 green towels remaining.
     - Let's find the number of white towels (Y).
       - We know that Maria gave 34 towels, some of which were white.
       - We have 21 white towels remaining, and some of them were given to her mother.
       - Let's find the difference between the number of white towels given to her mother (Y) and the number of white towels remaining (21 - Y).
       - Solving for Y:
       - Y = 34 or Y = -13
       - Rejection of Y = -13:
       - If Y is -13, then -13 (the remaining number of white towels) is negative, which we can't have.
       - Final number of white towels:
       - 21 - 0 = 21 white towels remaining.
   - Scenario 3, modified:
     - After giving away X green towels and Y white towels, Maria has (35 - X) green towels and (21 - Y) white towels remaining.
     - Maria's final number of towels:
     - (35 - X) + (21 - Y) = X + Y (combining both types of towels).
     - The final answer is:
     - X + Y = 56

That's it! We can find Maria's final number of towels (X + Y = 56) by solving the system of two equations with two unknowns (X and Y). However, we know that X cannot be 70 because it would result in a negative number of white towels (Y), which is physically",22

To find Adam's final score, we need to calculate the number of points he earned in each half of the game and then add them together.

In the first half, Adam answered 8 questions correctly, and each correct answer was worth 8 points. So, Adam earned a total of 8 * 8 = 64 points in the first half.

In the second half, Adam also answered 2 questions correctly, and again each correct answer was worth 8 points. So, Adam earned a total of 2 * 8 = 16 points in the second half.

Adding up Adam's scores from both halves, we get 64 points from the first half and 16 points from the second half, for a total score of 80 points.

                    question:
                     Paul was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday he filled 6 bags up and on Sunday he filled 3 more bags. If each bag had 8 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. On Saturday, Paul filled 6 bags with cans. Each bag contained 8 cans.

2. To find the total number of cans Paul collected on Saturday, we multiply the number of bags (6) by the number of cans per bag (8). 

    Saturday's cans = 6 * 8 = 48

3. On Sunday, Paul filled 3 more bags with cans.

4. To find the number of bags Paul filled on Sunday, we subtract the number of bags he filled on Saturday (6) from the total number of bags he filled over the weekend (we'll find that later). This leaves us with the number of bags Paul filled on Sunday alone.

   Let's call the total number of bags Paul filled x.

   x - 6 = 3

5. Now that we know how many bags Paul filled on Sunday, we can find how many cans were in those bags. Each bag contained 8 cans, so we multiply the number of bags times the number of cans per bag to find Sunday's cans.

   Sunday's cans = 3 * 8 = 24

6. Combining the number of cans Paul picked up on Saturday and Sunday, the total number of cans picked up over the weekend is:

    Total cans = Saturday's cans + Sunday's cans

    Total cans = 48 + 24

    Total cans = 72

7. Here's where we discover the total number of bags Paul filled over the weekend. When we subtracted the bags Paul filled on Saturday from the total number of bags filled over the weekend (x), we already know from step 4 that the number of bags he filled on Sunday was 3. So, the number of bags Paul filled on Saturday was x - 3.

   Let's call the total number of bags Paul filled over the weekend x again.

   x - 6 = 3

   3 ways to rephrase this:

   Subtracting the number of bags Paul filled on Saturday from the total number of bags he filled over the weekend, we're left with the number of bags Paul filled on Sunday - which we already found to be 3.

   We also know that on Saturday Paul filled exactly x - 6 bags.

   Another way to say this is that when we add together the number of bags Paul filled on Saturday and the number he filled on Sunday, we get the total number of bags filled over the weekend, which we know as x.

8. With this knowledge in hand, we can figure out the total number of cans each bag contained over the weekend. To do this, we multiply the total number of bags over the weekend (x) by the number of cans each bag contained (8).

    Weekend's cans per bag = x * 8

9. We know how many cans Paul collected over the weekend and how many it took to fill each bag (8). Because we also know how many bags Paul filled (x), we can find how many individual cans each bag contained, on average, by dividing the total number of cans picked up (72) by the number of bags filled (x).

    Number of cans per bag = 72 / x

10. Here's where we show everything we know so far.

    Saturday's cans = 48
    Sunday's cans = 24
    Total cans = 72
    Number of bags on Saturday = x - 6
    Number of bags on Sunday = 3
    
11. Let's make sure all these pieces fit together perfectly by making sure the number of cans picked up over the weekend equals the number of cans picked up on Saturday and Sunday added together.

    Total cans = Saturday's cans + Sunday's cans

    Total cans = 48 + 24

    Total cans = 72

12. Here's the final answer, all wrapped up with a bow!

    Paul picked up a total of 72 cans over the weekend.

    {The final answer is}. Paul picked up 72 cans over the weekend.

    How many individual cans did each bag Paul filled contain, on average?

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's first determine the number of points Bianca earned. For every 3 pounds of paper recycled, Bianca earned 1 point. So,

Bianca recycled 24 pounds of paper. On average, this is 8 pounds of paper per point (24 pounds divided by 3 points). So,

Bianca recycled 8 * 8 = 64 pounds of paper for each point she earned. This means she earned 24 / 64 = 0.375 points for recycling the 24 pounds.

So, Bianca earned 0.375 points. Since we only care about whole points, we'll round down to 0 points.

Now we'll determine the number of points Bianca's friends earned. Each friend recycled 3 pounds. For every 3 pounds recycled, they earned 1 point.

Friend 1 earned 1 point.

Friend 2 earned 1 point.

Friend 3 earned 1 point.

So, in total, Bianca's friends earned 3 points.

Adding Bianca's 0 points to her friend's 3 points, the total number of points earned from recycling is 3 points.

The final answer is: for recycling 27 pounds of paper, Bianca and her friends earned a total of 3 points.

Step 1: Determine how many chicken wings the 3 friends will get if they each receive the same amount.

Let's call the number of chicken wings each friend receives x.

The chef had 8 chicken wings cooked before the friends arrived. After the friends placed their order, the chef cooked 10 more chicken wings. In total, the chef had 18 chicken wings (8 before the friends arrived + 10 for the friends).

Each friend received an equal share of the chicken wings they ordered and the ones the chef had cooked exclusively for them. So each friend should receive x wings of the 10 they ordered plus their share of the previously cooked chicken wings.

We can set this up as an equation:

x + (10 ÷ 3) = 18 ÷ 3

Step 2: Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 3:

x + 3 = 6

Step 3: Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate x:

x = 3

So, each friend would get 3 chicken wings.

The final answer is:

Each friend would get 3 chicken wings.

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's represent the number of socks John had at the beginning as x, the number of old socks he threw away as y, and the number of new socks he bought as z. Then, we can set up a system of equations to model the problem:

x = 33 (number of socks initially)
y = 19 (number of old socks thrown away)
z = 13 (number of new socks bought)

Next, we want to figure out how many socks John has left after throwing away the old socks. We'll use the equation:

(original sock number) - (number of old socks to discard) = (number of remaining socks)

Substitute the given numbers into the formula:

x - y = new sock number (let's call this w)

33 - 19 = w (John has w sock left after throwing away the old socks)

Now, we know that John bought z new socks, and we want to find out what total number of socks he has after buying those new socks. We can use the same formula as above:

w + z = total sock number (let's call this t)

w + z = t (John has t socks after buying z new socks)

Let's replace w in the second equation with our formula from the first equation:

x - 19 + z = t (We know x and z, so we can substitute and solve for t)

Substitute the given numbers into the formula:

33 - 19 + 13 = t (John has t socks after buying z new socks)

30 + 13 = t (we can simplify this to make it easier to work with)

43 = t (we can add or subtract 30 from both sides to solve for t)

The final answer is:

John has 43 socks in total. {The final answer is: 43}</s>",27

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many players in total the coach has. We know that the team had 2 new players and 6 returning players, for a total of 8 players.

Next, we know that each group will have 4 players. The coach wants to put all 8 players into groups of 4, so the number of groups needed is equal to the number of players divided by the number of players in each group.

So, the number of groups needed is:

8 players ÷ 4 players per group = 2 groups

To double-check our answer, we could also count the number of ways we can make 4-player groups from 8 total players, which is:

8 choose 4 (Often denoted 8C4) = 70 (using a calculator, or through the formula 8! / (4! * 4!))

Since we have exactly that many groups (2), we know our answer is correct.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for finding the amount of time it takes to complete a job when working at a constant rate:

Time taken (in hours) = Total number of rooms remaining to be painted ÷ Average rate of painting (rooms/hour)

Average rate of painting = (Number of rooms painted so far ÷ Time taken to paint them) + (Total number of rooms remaining to be painted ÷ Time needed to paint them)

In this case, we have the following information:

- Total number of rooms to be painted: 6
- Number of rooms painted so far: 2
- Time taken to paint each room: 5 hours

Let's call the time taken to paint the first 2 rooms t. The total time taken to paint the first 2 rooms is 2t hours. The time taken to paint the remaining 4 rooms will be (4/[average rate of painting]) hours.

Let's find the average rate of painting:

Average rate of painting = (2/t) + (6-2)/(5-(2t/6))

To simplify this expression, we can notice that (6-2)/(5-(2t/6)) is equal to 4/(5-t/3). This happens because there are 6 rooms to be painted in total, and, after completing the first 2 rooms, we have 4 rooms left to be painted. The remaining 4 rooms take (4/[average rate of painting]) hours to paint.

Now, we can find the remaining time (r) needed to complete the remaining 4 rooms:

r = 4/(4/(5-t/3))

r = 16(5-t/3)

Let's substitute t = 2t/6 (since the painter has already painted 2 rooms):

r = 16(5-2t/18)

r = 96 - 32t/9

The total time taken to paint all the rooms is the sum of the time taken to paint the first 2 rooms (2t hours) and the remaining time (r hours). This gives us:

(2t + r) hours

Let's substitute r in terms of t:

(2t + 96 - 32t/9) hours

This simplifies to:

(640/27 + 16t/9) hours

To solve this problem, we can approach it in a systematic way by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Here's how:

1. We know that the waiter had a total of 22 customers in his section.
2. Some of these customers left, leaving 8 behind. The number of customers who left is therefore 14 (the total number of customers minus the remaining eight).
3. Let's say the waiter had n tables (each with 4 people). Initially, he had 22 seats for customers (4 seats per table times n tables).
4. After some customers left, he now has (4 seats per table times n tables) - (14 customers who left per table) seats left. This is because some of the customers who left may have been at tables with four seats. However, we know that we have 8 customers left, making each remaining table have 4-(8/n) customers per table.
5. We need to find the value of n (the number of tables) that satisfies our two statements: (4 seats per table times n tables) = 8 (the current number of remaining customers) and (4 seats per table times n tables) - (14 customers who left per table) = 16 (the initial number of seats for customers).
6. Setting up the equations:
   a) (4 seats per table times n tables) = 8 (the current number of remaining customers)
   b) (4 seats per table times n tables) - (14 customers who left per table) = 16 (the initial number of seats for customers)
7. Simplifying and solving:
   a) 16n = 8 (simplifying a)
   b) 16n - 56 = 16 (simplifying b)
   c) Solving (b) for n in terms of a: n = (16 + 56)/16 (substituting a into b and solving for n)
   d) Now we can substitute (d) into (a) and solve for n: n = 8/(16) = 0.5 (rounded down to an integer)
8. The final answer is: n = 1 (rounded down because we can't have decimals for the number of tables)

Therefore, the original statement about the number of tables (after some customers left) leads to the conclusion that there's only one table. This solution is valid because it works with both statements we set up, and makes the number of remaining tables an integer (because we rounded down).

So, the waiter had only one table left, each with exactly four seats (in order to accommodate the eight remaining customers).

                     Roger had 120 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 48 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 9 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's call the number of pieces of clothing in each small load x.

First, we know that Roger split the remaining 72 pieces of clothing into 9 equal parts. This means that each of the small loads contains the same number of clothes, or x.

Here's how we can calculate x:

72 pieces of clothing are split into 9 equal loads, so each load contains x pieces.

We know that x goes into 72 equally (since each small load contains the same number of clothes), so we can use long division to find x:

72 ÷ 9 = 8 with a remainder of 0 (we don't have any leftover pieces).

So each small load contains 8 pieces of clothing (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

Here's a summary of how we got our answer:

First, Roger washed 48 pieces of clothing in one load.

Next, he split the remaining 72 pieces of clothing into 9 equal loads, each containing x pieces of clothing.

In other words, we know that 48 pieces of clothing were washed in the first load, and 8 pieces of clothes were washed in each of the next 9 loads.

The final answer is:

With 120 pieces of clothing to wash, Roger washed 48 in the first load and 8 in each of the next 9 loads, for a total of {864} pieces of clothing washed.

We hope this explanation helps clarify the steps involved in solving this problem! Let us know if you have any further questions.</s>",8

<|assistant|>
1. At the start of the fourth grade, there were 10 students (let's call this number n1).

2. During the year, 4 students left the fourth grade (let's call this number n2). This means that the number of students left at the end of the year is n1 - n2.

3. In addition, 42 new students came to the fourth grade during the year (let's call this number n3). This means that the total number of students at the end of the year is equal to the number of students who remained and the number of new students. So, we can write:

(n1 - n2) + n3 = n4, where n4 represents the total number of students at the end of the year.

4. Substituting our known values in the equation, we get:

10 - 4 + 42 = n4.

5. Now let's simplify this equation by combining like terms and solving for n4.

10 - 4 = 96 (subtracting 4 from the left side and adding it to the right side).

96 + 42 = n4 (combining like terms).

138 = n4 (simplifying).

138 students were in fourth grade at the end of the year {The final answer is}.</s>",48

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's call the original number of books that Roger had to put away as ""x"".

So, there are 14 books in total (x books for Roger and 0 books for the librarian). When the librarian takes away 2 books, Roger is left with x-2 books. So, we have:

x-2 = 12 (14 total books minus the 2 books taken by the librarian)

Let's divide both sides by 3 to find out how many shelves can fit each set of three books. This gives us:

(x-2)/3 = n (number of shelves needed)

Now, we want to find out the value of x. Let's substitute the value we found for x-2 in terms of x back into the original formula for x. This gives us:

x = 14 - 2 (12 brought over from the x-2 formula)

Now we can find out the value of n using the formula for (x-2)/3. So, we have:

n = (14-2)/3

Simplifying:

n = 4

So, we need 4 shelves to fit all of Roger's books after the librarian has removed two.

{The final answer is: Roger will need 4 shelves to fit all of his remaining books after the librarian takes away 2.}</s>",4

                     Bianca picked 39 tulips and 49 roses to make flower bouquets. If she only used 81 of the flowers though, how many extra flowers did Bianca pick? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find the number of extra flowers Bianca picked, we first need to determine how many flowers she originally picked (excluding the ones she used to make the flower bouquets). This is because the 81 flowers she used to make the bouquets could potentially be from her total flower collection, which would need to be subtracted from the initial number of flowers to find the extra flowers she picked.

The number of flowers Bianca originally picked is the sum of the number of tulips and the number of roses she picked:

Number of flowers originally picked = 39 tulips + 49 roses

Substituting for the number of roses in terms of the number of flowers originally picked gives:

Number of flowers originally picked = 39 tulips + (number of flowers originally picked - 39) roses

Collapsing the equation using the distributive property, we get:

Number of flowers originally picked = 39 tulips + number of flowers originally picked - 39

Solving for the number of flowers originally picked gives:

Number of flowers originally picked = (39 tulips + number of flowers originally picked) - 39

Adding 39 to both sides of the equation, we have:

81 flowers she used came from this total number of flowers originally picked. So,

81 flowers she used = (39 tulips + number of flowers originally picked - 39) - 81

Simplifying gives:

0 = -48 tulips

This equation does not make sense, as the number of flowers originally picked cannot be a negative number. Therefore, we know that there is a mistake in the given problem. For the sake of the exercise, let's assume that Bianca picked all the tulips, and we will continue with our original process.

Number of flowers originally picked = 39 tulips + 49 roses

Now that we know the original number of flowers, we can calculate how many extra flowers Bianca picked by finding the difference between the number of flowers originally picked and the number of flowers she used to make the bouquets:

Extras flowers picked = Number of flowers originally picked - 81 flowers she used

Extras flowers picked = 39 tulips + 49 roses - 81

Simplifying, we get:

Extras flowers picked = 21 roses

In conclusion, Bianca picked 21 additional roses, for a total of 70 roses, bringing her total flower collection to 110 (39 tulips and 70 roses). However, as we have identified a mistake in the original problem, we cannot be 100% certain about the accuracy of this solution.

To find the total time it took Emily to assemble all of her new furniture, we can add up the time for each piece:

Total time (min) = 4 chairs @ 8 min/chair + 2 tables @ 8 min/table

Total time (min) = 32 minutes (from chairs) + 32 minutes (from tables)

<|assistant|>
To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we need to count the birds in all the bird cages.

Let's make a list of the number of birds in each cage:

Cage 1: 2 parrots and 7 parakeets = 9 birds
Cage 2: 2 parrots and 7 parakeets = 9 birds
Cage 3: 2 parrots and 7 parakeets = 9 birds
Cage 4: 2 parrots and 7 parakeets = 9 birds
Cage 5: 2 parrots and 7 parakeets = 9 birds
Cage 6: 2 parrots and 7 parakeets = 9 birds

Now let's add up the number of birds in all 6 cages:

9 birds in Cage 1
9 birds in Cage 2
9 birds in Cage 3
9 birds in Cage 4
9 birds in Cage 5
9 birds in Cage 6

When we add all of these numbers together, we get a total of 54 birds in all the bird cages.

The final answer is:

The pet store has a total of 54 birds.

Alternatively, we could also find the total number of birds by counting the total number of parrots and parakeets.

There are 6 cages, each containing 2 parrots. So, the total number of parrots is:

2 parrots in Cage 1
2 parrots in Cage 2
2 parrots in Cage 3
2 parrots in Cage 4
2 parrots in Cage 5
2 parrots in Cage 6

When we add up all of the parrot counts, we get a total of 12 parrots.

Similarly, there are 6 cages, each containing 7 parakeets. So, the total number of parakeets is:

7 parakeets in Cage 1
7 parakeets in Cage 2
7 parakeets in Cage 3
7 parakeets in Cage 4
7 parakeets in Cage 5
7 parakeets in Cage 6

When we add up all of the parakeet counts, we get a total of 42 parakeets.

When we add the total number of parrots and parakeets, we get the same answer we had before:

                     Dave had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 20 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can create a system of equations to represent the number of shirts (short sleeve and long sleeve) that Dave had washed at two different times.

Let x represent the number of short sleeve shirts that Dave had not washed by the time school started.

And let y represent the number of long sleeve shirts that Dave had not washed by the time school started.

Since Dave had washed 9 short sleeve shirts before school, and some (x) were left to be washed, we can write:

9 - x = Number of short sleeve shirts washed before school

Similarly, for long sleeve shirts, we write:

27 - y = Number of long sleeve shirts washed before school

And since we know that Dave had washed 20 shirts by the time school started, we write:

9 - x + 20 = Number of short sleeve shirts washed by the time school started (Total short sleeve shirts)

27 - y + 20 = Number of long sleeve shirts washed by the time school started (Total long sleeve shirts)

Combining these equations, we get:

9 - x + 20 = Total short sleeve shirts 

27 - y + 20 = Total long sleeve shirts 

We know that the total number of short sleeve shirts and the total number of long sleeve shirts are:

Total short sleeve shirts = Short sleeve shirts washed before school + Short sleeve shirts left to be washed by the time school started = 9 + x

Total long sleeve shirts = Long sleeve shirts washed before school + Long sleeve shirts left to be washed by the time school started = 27 + y

Using this, we can substitute for Total short sleeve shirts and Total long sleeve shirts in the above equations to get:

9 + x + 20 = 9 + x

27 + y + 20 = 27 + y

Now, subtracting the same term (9 and 27, respectively) and variables (x and y, respectively) from both sides of the equations (to isolate the unknown variables) gives:

x = 1 (Short sleeve shirts left to be washed)

y = 7 (Long sleeve shirts left to be washed)

Adding x and y, we get the total number of shirts Dave didn't wash by school start:

1 + 7 = 8

Therefore, Dave didn't wash 8 shirts (1 short sleeve and 7 long sleeve) by the time school started. {The final answer is 8}.

<|assistant|>
Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Haley took a total of 50 pictures at the zoo. (This is our base case.) {The final answer is 50 pictures from the zoo.}

2. She also took 8 pictures at the museum. (These pictures are separate from the ones she took at the zoo.)

3. In total, Haley took (50 pictures at the zoo + 8 pictures at the museum) = 58 pictures during her vacation. (This is the sum of the pictures she took at the zoo and the museum.) {The final answer is 58 pictures from her vacation.}

4. Later, Haley deleted 38 pictures from her collection. (This could include pictures from both the zoo and the museum.)

5. Now, the number of pictures Haley has left is equal to the total number of pictures she took during her vacation, less the number of pictures she deleted. This is represented by:

   (Number of pictures from the zoo remaining) + (Number of pictures from the museum remaining) = (Total number of pictures she took during vacation) - (Number of pictures she deleted)

   Re-writing this equation, we get:

   50 - 38 (the number of pictures she deleted from the zoo) + 8 (the number of pictures she took at the museum) = 58 - 38 (the total number of pictures she deleted)

6. When we expand the expression, we get:

   12 (the number of pictures she kept from the zoo) + 8 (the number of pictures she kept from the museum) = 20 (the total number of pictures she kept from both the zoo and the museum)

7. Now we have a simpler equation that relates the number of pictures she keeps from both places. This is our answer:

   The final number of pictures that Haley still has from her vacation is 20 (which is the sum of the pictures she kept from the zoo and the museum).

   {The final answer is 20 pictures left after deleting 38 of them.}
   Alternatively:

                     A florist had 5 roses. If she sold 3 of them and then later picked 34 more, how many roses would she have? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, let's call the initial number of roses the florist had ""x"". Once she sold 3 of them, she would have (x - 3) roses. When she later picked up 34 more roses, the total number of roses she would have is the sum of the roses she had after selling 3 and the additional 34 roses she picked up, which is (x - 3) + 34.

To solve for x, we can set up an equation and use substitution to eliminate variables:

5 = x (the original number of roses)
x - 3 = (x - 3) + 34 (the new number of roses after selling and picking up more)

Subtracting (x - 3) (a common term) from both sides of the equation will leave us with only the unknown variable and the 34 we added:

2 = 34

Unfortunately, this doesn't work out. Since we multiplied 2 by 17 as our answer, we'd really need 34 to be 17 times smaller, which doesn't make much sense. Therefore, the equation is incorrect as written. In reality, the initial number of roses (x) must be larger than 34, since the florist still has some roses after she sells 3 and then adds 34 more.

Let's say instead that the initial number of roses (x) was really 70. After selling 3, she would still have (x - 3) = 67 roses. And then after picking up 34 more, she would have (x - 3) + 34 = 101 roses. So, using our original setup:

70 = x
x - 3 = 101

Now we can subtract (x - 3) again as before:

67 = 38

Again, this doesn't work. 38 isn't a multiple of 67. Therefore, the only way this equation could have been true is if both sides had been equal to zero. In that case, the florist didn't have any roses to begin with, which isn't what we were originally told.

Unfortunately, the given numbers create conflicting scenarios. The florist couldn't have had 5 roses, sold 3, and then magically picked up 34 more (while also still having some left over). The story provided in the question may not accurately represent the situation.

{The final answer is unknown, as the given scenario is mathematically inconsistent.}

<|assistant|>
1. First, we need to find out how many total sodas Cody bought. Since he bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas, the total number of sodas is:

    regular sodas: 4
    diet sodas: 44
    Total: 48

2. Next, we know Cody's fridge can only hold 6 sodas on each shelf. So, if we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas per shelf, we get the number of shelves needed to hold all the sodas:

    Total sodas: 48
    Sodas per shelf: 6
    Shelves needed: 48 ÷ 6 = 8

3. But we also know that Cody has 4 regular sodas, which take up space on the shelves. We need to account for these sodas when we find out how many shelves will be filled up:

    Regular sodas taken up by shelves: 4
    Diet sodas taken up by shelves: (44 sodas / shelf) * (number of shelves filled)
    Total sodas taken up by shelves: 4 + (44 sodas / shelf) * (number of shelves filled)

4. We want to find the number of shelves filled up with sodas. Let's call this variable x. So, when we substitute x for the number of shelves filled, we can find the number of regular and diet sodas that will take up space on the shelves, and the total number of sodas taken up by the shelves:

    Regular sodas taken up by shelves: 4
    Diet sodas taken up by shelves: x * (44 sodas / shelf)
    Total sodas taken up by shelves: 4 + x * (44 sodas / shelf)

5. Now, we know that the number of total sodas we bought is the same as the number of sodas taken up by the shelves. So, we can set these equations equal to each other:

    48 = 4 + x * (44 sodas / shelf)

6. Let's factor out x to clarify that we're finding the number of shelves filled up:

    48 = x * (44 sodas / shelf + 4 / shelf)

7. To solve for x, we can use the distributive property to simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

    48 = x * (44/shelf + 4/shelf)
    48 = x * (44 + 4)/shelf
    48 shelf-spaces = x * (48 shelf-spaces) / shelf
    Shelves filled up: Int(48 shelf-spaces / x) shelf-spaces / shelf

8. To find the whole number of shelves filled up (i.e., leaving nothing on empty shelves), we can use the floor function, int, to keep track of the whole number.

    Shelves filled up: Int(48 shelf-spaces / x) shelf-spaces / shelf

{The final answer is} Shelves filled up: Int(48 shelf-spaces / x) shelf-spaces / shelf.

This expression involves the floor function, Int, because we want to find the whole number of shelves filled up without including empty shelves. By multiplying the int function result by the remaining shelf-spaces divided by the shelf, we can represent exactly how many shelves are filled up. This expression provides a clear and step-by-step approach to solving the problem, from identifying the initial challenge and the relevant variables, to deriving and explaining each calculation leading to the final solution.</s>",8

                     The school cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 5 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many apples were originally given for the students who wanted fruit. We know that 6 red apples and 15 green apples were ordered for the students' lunches. Let's say r red apples and g green apples were given to the students who wanted fruit.

Then the number of apples given to the students who didn't want fruit is:
(Total number of apples - number of apples given to fruit-eating students)
(6 red apples + 15 green apples - r red apples - g green apples)

Now, since we know that only 5 students wanted fruit, we can find the number of non-fruit-eating students (n) by dividing the total number of students by the number of fruit-eating students and multiplying by the number of non-fruit-eating students.

n = Total number of students / Number of fruit-eating students * Number of non-fruit-eating students
n = 100 / 5 * 95
n = 95

Now, let's find the number of apples given to the non-fruit-eating students.

Non-fruit-eating students' apples = Number of non-fruit-eating students * Type of apple (red or green) per student
Non-fruit-eating students' apples = 95 * Number of red or green apples per student (let's call it m)

We know that 6 red apples and 15 green apples were ordered. Let's say m red apples and kg green apples were ordered for the non-fruit-eating students. Then the total number of apples ordered is:

6 red apples + 15 green apples + m red apples + kg green apples

Let's set up an equation to find the values of m and kg.

6 + 15 + m + kg = 675 (Total number of apples ordered)

Let's solve for m and kg in terms of known quantities.

6 + 15 + 95 * m / 100 + kg / 100 = 675

95 * m / 100 + kg / 100 = 664

We know that kg cannot exceed the total number of green apples ordered, which is 15.

The number of extra apples (e) is:

e = Total number of apples - Number of apples given to students
e = 675 - (6 + 15 + r + g + kg + m)

Now, let's substitute all the known values in the above equation and solve for e to find the exact number of extra apples.

The final answer is: {The final answer is the calculated number of extra apples}</s>",16

<|assistant|>
Solution:

1. We have a total of 24 people (9 managers and 15 employees) who want to play volleyball.

2. We need to divide them into 8 teams. This means that each team should have an equal number of players.

3. Let's say each team has x number of players.

4. To find the value of x, use the formula:

   Total number of people = Number of teams X Number of players in each team

   So,

   24 = 8 x x

5. Now, let's find the value of x by solving the equation above.

   24 = 8(x)

   3 x = 24

   x = 3

   Number of players in each team = 3

6. So, each team will have 3 people, making it a team of 3.

<|assistant|>
Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Mike had left after buying the new mower blades.

Mike made a total of $42 mowing lawns over the summer. He spent $10 on new mower blades. The amount of money Mike had left is the difference between the total he made and the amount he spent on the mower blades:

$42 - $10 = $32

So, after buying the new mower blades, Mike has $32 left.

Step 2: Calculate how many 8-dollar games Mike can buy with the remaining $32.

The number of games Mike can buy with $32 is calculated by dividing $32 by the price of each game:

$32 \div 8 = 4

So, Mike can buy 4 games with the $32 he has left.

Here is the final answer:

Final Answer: Mike can buy 4 $8 games with the money he has left. {The final answer is: Mike can buy 4 $8 games with the money he has left.}</s>",4

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find out how long it will take the chef to cook the remaining 8 potatoes, we first need to find out how many potatoes have already been cooked. The chef has already cooked 5 potatoes, so we know that there are 8 more potatoes left to be cooked.

Now let's find out how long it takes to cook one potato. According to the problem, each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

Next, let's calculate the total time it takes to cook the 5 potatoes that have already been cooked. We know that each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, so the total time taken to cook 5 potatoes is 5 x 6 = 30 minutes.

Let's find out how long it will take the chef to cook the remaining 8 potatoes. Since each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, the total time taken to cook 8 potatoes will be 8 x 6 = 48 minutes.

Since we already know that the chef has cooked 5 potatoes for 30 minutes, we can find out how long it will take the chef to cook the remaining 8 potatoes by finding the difference between the total time required for cooking all the potatoes and the time already spent on cooking the first 5 potatoes. Mathematically, we can represent this as:

(Total time required to cook all the potatoes) - (Time already spent) = (Time required to cook the remaining potatoes)

Substituting the values, we get:

(Time required to cook all the potatoes) - (Time already spent) = (Time required to cook the remaining potatoes)

(Total time required to cook 13 potatoes) - (30 minutes for cooking the first 5 potatoes) = (Time required to cook the remaining 8 potatoes)

(13 x 6) - 30 = (8 x 6)

78 - 30 = 48

48 minutes is the time required to cook the remaining 8 potatoes.

Now we have a complete breakdown of how long it takes the chef to cook all the potatoes. Adding the amount of time already spent and the time required to cook the remaining potatoes, we get the total time taken by the chef to cook all the potatoes, which is:

(30 minutes for cooking the first 5 potatoes) + (48 minutes for cooking the remaining 8 potatoes)

78 minutes in total.

So, the final answer is, {The total time taken by the chef to cook all the potatoes is 78 minutes}.</s>",48

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many math and science problems Paige has left to do at home.

Let x represent the number of math problems and y represent the number of science problems Paige has left to do.

We know that when Paige left school, she had a total of 43 math problems and 12 science problems left. Since she finished 44 of the problems at school, the number of math and science problems she has finished is 43 - 44 and 12, respectively.

At school, Paige finished a total of (43 - 44) + 12 = 9 math and science problems. Therefore, when she left school, she still had (43 - 9) = 34 math problems and (12 - 9) = 3 science problems left to do.

To find the total number of problems Paige has left to do at home, we add the remaining math and science problems: 

x + y = 34 + 3 = 37

This equation represents the total number of problems Paige hasn't finished yet. Since we know that the total number of problems Paige left school with is 43, we can find the number of problems she finished by subtracting the number of problems she has left to do:

43 - 37 = 6

Therefore, Paige finished 6 problems at school, leaving her to do the remaining 37 problems at home. The equation x + 3 = 37 tells us how many of the remaining problems are math problems (x).

To find x, we subtract the remaining science problems from both sides:

x + 3 = 37
x + 3 - 3 = 37 - 3
x = 34

This tells us that Paige has 34 math problems left to do at home, or:

x = 34

The final answer is: Paige has 34 math problems left to do at home for homework.</s>",11

To find out how much Vanessa spent on her flower purchases from April's Discount Flowers, we need to determine the price of each type of flower and then find the total cost of buying 3 roses and 3 daisies.

Let's say that each rose costs $8, and each daisy costs $8 as well, because they were also on sale.

The price of 3 roses is:

3 roses at $8 each = $24 for the roses

The price of 3 daisies is:

3 daisies at $8 each = $24 for the daisies

So, the total cost of Vanessa's flower purchases is:

$24 (for the roses) + $24 (for the daisies) = $48

Therefore, Vanessa spent a total of $48 on her flower purchases from April's Discount Flowers during the sale when the price of each flower was $8. {The final answer is $48.}</s>",48

<|assistant|>
To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to first find how many pictures are in total after Olivia uploaded all 40 pictures to Facebook. Let's call this total number of pictures x.

We know that Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone, so these 5 pictures are already on Facebook. Let's call this number of pictures p. Now, the formula for the total number of pictures is:

x = 5 (from phone) + 35 (from camera) = 40

Substituting the values we found, we get:

x = 40

Now that we know the total number of pictures, we can calculate the number of pictures in each album. Each album will contain the same number of pictures, which we will call y. Let's find this value.

First, we know that there are a total of 8 albums. Each album will contain y pictures. So, our second equation is:

8y = x

We again substitute the values we found:

8y = 40

Next, we isolate y in the formula:

y = (40 ÷ 8)

y = 5

So, the number of pictures in each album is 5.

Therefore, there are {5} pictures in each of the 8 albums.

In summary, Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 pictures from her camera to Facebook, which she then sorted into 8 different albums with the same number of pictures in each album. After sorting, each of the albums contains {5} pictures.</s>",5

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find how many chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies are needed for each baggage. Since there are 6 cookies in each baggage, if we let x be the number of chocolate chip cookies and y be the number of oatmeal cookies in each baggage, then:

   x + y = 6     (total number of cookies in each baggage)

2. From the given information, we know that Robin has a total of 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies. We need to find out how many baggages can Robin make using both types of cookies.

   Note that we cannot simply add the number of chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies together because we don't know how many baggages we can make from each type of cookie separately.

3. To find the number of baggages that Robin can make using chocolate chip cookies, let's call this k. Since we now know how many chocolate chip cookies we need for each baggage, we can write this as follows:

    k*x = K*(6-y)     (This is the number of chocolate chip cookies in k* baggages)

    k*x = 6*k-k*y    (Using simplification)

4. Next, we repeat the above process to find the number of oatmeal cookies that go into k* baggages:

    k*y = K*(6-x)    (This is the number of oatmeal cookies in k* baggages)

    k*y = 6*k-k*x      

5. Now, we have four expressions, each representing the number of cookies that go into k* baggages from each type of cookie. Remember that Robin also has some extra cookies from each type, and we need to account for these as well. So, the total number of cookies that Robin has is:

    x + y = 23 (chocolate chip cookies)

    x = 23 - y       (Using simplification)

   and

    x + y = 25 (oatmeal cookies)

    y = 25 - x    (Using simplification)

6. To find the total number of baggages that Robin can make, calculate the sum of the number of baggages that we have found using chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies:

   k + K = (23-y) / x + (25-x) / y

   (where k and K are the number of baggages made from chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies separately)

   k + K = 23/(23-y) + 25/(25-x)   (Simplifying the above equation)

7. Note that the above expression is equivalent to the system of equations:

   k*(x+y) + K*(x+y) = 23*k + 25*K

   This is because from the first set of equations we created (step 3 and step 4), we get that if x or y is increased in one equation, then the other must decrease by the same amount. This ensures that the total number of cookies remains unchanged, and so we get the original number of baggies that we started with.

8. However, as the original number of baggies is the same as the number of baggies that we calculate using the formula from step 6, and the expression k + K from step 6 is the solution we were trying to find, we can use this to check if our answers from step 7 are correct. If they are, then the solution obtained in Step 7 is equivalent to the solution obtained from Step 6.

9. After simplifying the above equation, we get:

   k*(23-y) + K*(25-x) = (23*x + 25*y)

10. We know that y = 25 - x, and x = 23 - y (from step 6). So,

   k*23 + K*25 = (23-y)*(23-y) + (25-x)*(25-x)

   Now, let's simplify the right-hand side:

                </s> 
<|assistant|
To find the number of candies Katie and her sister have left after eating 8 pieces, we can approach the problem as follows:

1. Katie initially had 8 pieces of candy, which we can represent as 8.
2. Her sister had an initial number of candies, which we can represent as x.
3. When they ate 8 pieces in total (4 from Katie and 4 from her sister) on the first night, Katie's remaining number of candies can be found by subtracting the 4 she ate from her initial number of 8: Katie's remaining candies = 8 - 4, which is equal to 4.
4. Her sister's remaining number of candies can be found by subtracting the 4 she ate from her initial number of x: Her sister's remaining candies = x - 4.
5. Adding the remaining numbers of candies from both sisters, we get the total number of candies they have left: Total number of candies left = 4 (from Katie) + (x - 4) (from her sister).

Let’s write an equation representing this situation. Starting with Katie…

8 (initially from Katie) – 4 (eaten by Katie) = 4 (current number of candies from Katie)

Similarly, representing her sister’s initial and remaining candies:

x – 4 = (initial number of candies less the 4 she ate)

Adding Katie's and her sister's remaining candies to get the total number of candies left:

4 + (x - 4) = Total number of candies left

Combining our equations:

8 - 4 = 4 and x - 4 = Total number of candies left - 4 (we have already taken 4 candies from both sisters)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns (8 and x). We can solve for one of the unknowns (x) by substituting one equation into the other.

8 - 4 = 4        (substituting 8 into the equation x - 4 = Total number of candies left - 4)
x - 4 = Total number of candies left - 4

Subtract 4 from both sides of this equation:

x - 8 = Total number of candies left - 8

Add 8 to both sides:

x = Total number of candies left

Now, let's equate the number of candies left to the value of x:

Total number of candies left = x

Putting everything together:

Total number of candies left = Katie's original number of candies (8) plus her sister's original number of candies (x) minus the 8 candies they both ate:

Total number of candies left = 8 + x - 8

Simplifying:

Total number of candies left = x

At this point, we have the value of the total number of candies left as equal to unknown variable x, so we replace x with its equivalent value. The expression for the number of candies left is:

Total number of candies left = Katie's original number of candies (8) plus her sister's original number of candies (23) minus the 8 candies that they ate:

Total number of candies left = 8 + 23 - 8

Adding and subtracting:

Total number of candies left = 23

Therefore, after eating 8 candies, they have a total of 23 candies left, which is the final answer. {The final answer is 23.}</s>",23

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Find the number of unused puppies (puppies left after selling 34). Let x be the number of unused puppies.

2. Since there are 88 puppies in total, the number of sold puppies should be 88 - x.

3. We know that the store sold 34 puppies. Setting up an equation,

   Sold puppies = Unsold puppies + Sold puppies

   Let A and B represent the number of unsold and sold puppies, respectively.

   88 = A + B

   Substituting A (unknown) and B (34) into the equation:

   88 = A + 34

   Solve for A:

   A = 88 - 34

   A = 54

   Thus, we know that there are 54 unsold puppies.

4. Now, let C be the number of cages.

5. We know that each cage has 6 puppies. Let D be the number of puppies in all the cages.

6. Since there are x unused puppies left, the total number of puppies in all the cages and the remaining unused puppies should be 88.

   D + x = 88

7. But we also know that the number of puppies in the cages is D (total number of puppies in all cages) and each cage has 6 puppies.

   So, the number of cages required is C.

   C = (D / 6) round to nearest int.

8. Substituting D from step 6 in step 7:

   C = (x / 6) round to nearest int. + (88 - x) / 6 round to nearest int.

9. Solving in terms of x:

   C = (88 - x) / 6 round to nearest int.

10. Substituting x from step 1:

   C = (88 - 54) / 6 round to nearest int.

   C = 19 round to nearest int.

11. Thus, the final answer is: 

   The store used around 19 cages.

" Jerry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 8 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another, how many trips will he make? ","<|user|>

                    question:
                     Jerry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 8 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another, how many trips will he make? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Here's the step by step reasoning:

1. Jerry has to carry a total of 16 trays (9 from one table and 7 from another).
2. Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, so we need to find how many times he needs to make trips to carry all 16 trays.
3. The first step would be to carry the 9 trays from the first table. This requires exactly one trip.
4. After carrying the first table, Jerry will have 9 trays in his hands, and there would be no trays left at the first table. So now he needs to carry 7 trays from the second table.
5. Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, but there are only 7 trays left to carry from the second table. This means that Jerry will have to make at least one more trip.
6. Let x be the number of trips to carry the remaining seven trays from the second table.
7. To find out the value of x, we can write the number of trays carried on xth trip in terms of x.
8. On the xth trip, Jerry will carry the remaining 7 trays from the second table, so he carries 7*x trays in total on x trips.
9. So, the total number of trays Jerry has carried so far is the number of trays carried from the first table, plus the number of trays carried in the previous trips (7 * (x-1) trips), plus the number of remaining trays that he carries from the second table on the xth trip.
10. Mathematically, let b be the number of trays Jerry has already carried from the first table, and a be the number of remaining trays to carry from the second table (which is 7).
11. Now, the total number of trays carried so far is 'b' from the first table, 'a' from the first table (as Jerry already carried a few from the first table) and 'a' from the second table (as we assume that we've already taken the (x-1) trips from the second table).
12. Substituting the values in our equation, we can find 'x' as follows:
   b + 7 * (x-1) + a * x = 16
13. Simplifying this, we get:
    a * x = 16 - b - 7(x-1)
14. This is a linear equation relating 'x' to 'a'. Since 'a' is a constant, we just need to find the intersection of this line with the horizontal axis, which represents the solution of 'x'.
15. Using the quadratic formula, we find 'x' as follows:
   x = (-7(x-1))/(1 - 7a/16)
16. This is a complex expression and doesn't simplify easily, so let's see what does 'a' represent. 'a' represents the number of remaining trays to be carried from the second table. This, in fact, isn't a constant as we already assume that jerry has carried some of them in previous trips.
17. This means that 'a' will keep decreasing with each remaining trip. And the value of 'a' decreases as 'x' increases. This is causing the coefficient '7(x-1)' to be continuously decreasing as 'x' increases.
18. This tells us that 'x' increases as 'x' increases, which is an absurd assumption, as 'x' should be a whole number representing the number of trips required.
19. This tells us that our analysis has a flaw - we're assuming that we could keep carrying the trays in fractional numbers. Clearly, that's not possible.
20. This tells us that our initial assumption, that 'a' is a constant value, is invalid. Rather 'a' is the remaining number of trays left for Jerry to carry at each trip. Hence, for the next trip, he'll have to carry less number of trays as some of them we already carried in the previous trip.
21. In other words, after each remaining trip, 'a' becomes one less than the previous value.
22. Using this, instead of a linear equation now we can have a recursive formula which, at each iteration, decrements 'a' by 1, to simulate the remaining trays to be carried.
23. Mathematically, we can write this",2

To find the total number of carrots Megan has after picking 19 and then adding 46 the next day, while also accounting for the 4 carrots she threw out in between, we can use the following steps:

1. After picking 19 carrots, Megan threw out 4. Therefore, she has 15 carrots remaining, or 19 - 4 = 15. {The final answer at this point is: 15}

2. The next day, Megan picked 46 more carrots, in addition to the 15 she already had. Therefore, her total number of carrots after the second day is the sum of the 46 she picked and the 15 she previously had, or 46 + 15 = 61. {The final answer is: 61}

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To find the number of groups with 8 players each and a total of 12 new players and 44 returning players, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to determine how many players in total there are. Add the number of returning players (44) and the number of new players (12) to get the total number of players:

   Total number of players = Returning players + New players

   Total number of players = 44 + 12

   Total number of players = 56

2. Now, we can find how many of these players are new. We know that the number of new players is 12. How many of the remaining players (56 - 12) are new?

   Number of new players = 12

   Number of returning players = 56 - 12

   Let x be the number of returning players. Then, x + 12 = 56. Substituting this into the equation for returning players, we get:

   Number of returning players = x

   x + 12 = 56

   x = 56 - 12

   x = 44

   So, the number of returning players is 44.

3. Next, we can find the number of groups needed to fit all these players. Each group will have 8 players, so we need to divide the total number of players by 8 to find the number of groups:

   Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players per group

   Number of groups = 56 / 8

   Number of groups = 7

4. Finally, we can check if our answer makes sense. We know that the first 44 players (the returning players) were put into groups of 8. If we add the new players to these groups, we should arrive back at the total number of players.

   Total number of players = Number of players in existing groups + Number of new players

   Total number of players = 44 * 8 + 12

   Total number of players = 576 + 12

   Total number of players = 588

   Since our first step found that the total number of players is 56, our answer of 7 groups appears correct.

<|assistant|>
Step 1: Calculate how much money Will has left after purchasing the new mower blades.

Total amount Will earned: $104
Cost of new mower blades: $41
Money left over: $104 - $41 = $63

Step 2: Determine how many $9 games Will can buy with the remaining money.

Cost of one game: $9
Number of games Will can buy: $63 ÷ $9 = 7 games

The final answer is: Will can buy 7 $9 games with the money he has left. {The final answer is: Will can buy 7 $9 games with the money he has left.}

So, the total amount Will spent on games would be $63 - $72 = $11. We assume that the price of the games is an integer (a whole number). Therefore, we can round it to $63 - $72 (or 11) dollars, to account for any small change that Will might have left. Our final calculation becomes: $63 - $72 = $11 .

Therefore, Will can buy 7 games with his remaining money, and he spent $11 on small changes and rounding errors.

The total number of games Will bought over the summer would be the initial amount ($104) minus the expenses for new mower blades ($41) and games bought during the summer ($9 \times$ 7). After rounding, we can write:

Total number of games = $104 - $41 - $63 = $3  (or $104 - $104 = $0)

But as the total number of games cannot be a negative number, it should be rounded to 0. Therefore, we can say that Will did not buy any games during the summer.

Final answer: {The final answer is: Will bought zero games during the summer with a total earnings of $104, and he can buy 7 $9 games with the remaining $63 after paying $41 for the new mower blades.}</s>",7

<|assistant|>
 To find the total number of carrots Nancy has after picking 21 more carrots the next day, we first need to find out how many carrots she has after throwing away 2 out of the 12 she picked on the first day. Let's call the number of carrots she has after throwing away 2 of the 12 carrots ""x"".

On the first day, Nancy picked 12 carrots. She then threw away 2 of them, leaving her with x carrots.

On the second day, Nancy picked an additional 21 carrots. We can find out how many carrots she has in total after the second day by finding the sum of the number of carrots she has after the first day (x) and the number of carrots she picked on the second day (21).

Let's write out each step:

1. On the first day, Nancy picked 12 carrots.
2. She threw away 2 of them, leaving her with x carrots.
3. On the second day, Nancy picked an additional 21 carrots.
4. The total number of carrots Nancy has now is the sum of the number of carrots she had after the first day (x) and the number of carrots she picked on the second day (21).

Let's write down what we just determined:

x + 21 = Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day

To solve for x, we can subtract 21 from both sides of the equation:

x + 21 - 21 = Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day - 21

Solving for x, we get:

x = Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day - 21

So, let's substitute this into the original equation to find out the total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day:

Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day = x + 21
            
Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day = [Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day - 21] + 21
            
Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day = Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day

Simplifying, we get:

Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day = Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day - 21 + 21
            
Or:

Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day = Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day
            
Subtracting 21 from both sides:

Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day - 21 = Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day - 21
            
Simplifying, we get:

0 = 0

This is a true statement, so we know that our original equation [Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day = x + 21] is correct. If we substitute what we solved for ""x"" above into our original equation, we can replace the ""x"" with the equivalent expression we just found:

Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day = [Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day - 21] + 21
            
Expanding:

Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day = Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day - 21 + 21
            
Simplifying:

Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day = Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day
            
Substituting for ""Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day"" using our original expression:

Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day = x + 21
            
Now, since we derived an expression for x in terms of the total number of carrots she has after the second day, let's substitute this expression into our original equation.

Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day = [Total number of carrots Nancy has after the second day - 21] + 21

To find out how long it will take the chef to cook the remaining 6 potatoes, we first need to calculate how many potatoes are left to be cooked. Since the chef has already cooked 6 potatoes, there are 12 - 6, which is 6 potatoes left remaining to be cooked.

Let's call the time it takes to cook the remaining 6 potatoes 'x'. Since we know that each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, and the chef has already cooked 6 potatoes for a total of 6 * 6 = 36 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to cook the remaining 6 potatoes as follows:

6 potatoes take 'x' minutes to cook. So, the time taken to cook all 12 potatoes (the ones that have already been cooked + the remaining 6) should be the sum of the time taken to cook the first 6 and the remaining 6:

36 minutes (time taken to cook first 6 potatoes) + x (time taken to cook remaining 6 potatoes) = 12 * 6 = 72 minutes (total time taken to cook all 12 potatoes)

Now, substituting the known values and solving for 'x', we get:

x = 72 - 36 = 36 minutes

So, the chef will take 36 minutes to cook the remaining 6 potatoes.

Therefore, the total time taken to cook all 12 potatoes will be:

36 minutes (time taken to cook remaining 6 potatoes) + 36 minutes (time taken to cook first 6 potatoes) = 72 minutes (total time taken to cook all 12 potatoes)

1. Firstly, we know that Luke started with 57 games. After selling 39 of them, how many games are left over? To find this, we can subtract the number of sold games (39) from the total number of games (57). 

57 - 39 = 18 games remain

2. Next, Luke packed the remaining games into boxes, using 2 games per box. How many boxes will this leave us with? Divide the number of remaining games by the number of games in each box. 

18 ÷ 2 = 9 boxes

3. Therefore, the total number of boxes Luke used is the sum of the initial number of boxes (which we assume is zero, as we don't know how many boxes he started with) and the number of extra boxes he filled with his remaining games. 

0 + 9 = 9 boxes used in total

The final answer is:  Luke used a total of 9 boxes to pack the remaining games after selling 39.</s>",9

To find out how much Emily spent on her flower purchase, we need to first find out how much each flower costs. Since each flower costs $3, we can calculate the cost of one rose and one daisy as follows:

1 rose: $3
1 daisy: $3

Emily bought a total of 4 flowers, which includes 2 roses and 2 daisies. We can calculate the total cost of the flowers as follows:

2 roses: $6 (2 x $3)
2 daisies: $6 (2 x $3)

The total cost of Emily's flower purchase is the sum of the costs of the roses and daisies:

Total cost: $12 ($6 for roses and $6 for daisies)

We can write our final answer as follows:

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Faye and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Faye picked 23 and her mother picked 5. If only 12 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we first find the total number of carrots picked by Faye and her mom. Faye picked 23 carrots, and her mother picked 5 carrots, so the total number of carrots picked is 23 + 5, which is 28 carrots.

There were a total of 12 good carrots, so we can find the number of bad carrots by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots. Let x represent the number of bad carrots. Then,

12 (good carrots) + x (bad carrots) = 28 (total carrots)

We can solve for x by subtracting 12 (good carrots) from both sides and then dividing both sides by -1.

x = -36 (+12 for the good carrots) - (28-12) for the total carrots found

x = -16 (number of bad carrots)

However, since we cannot have a negative number of bad carrots, our assumption that there were 12 good carrots is incorrect, since some of the carrots were bad, and fewer good carroots were picked than we assumed.

We can solve the problem instead by assuming that there were less than 12 good carrots. Let g represent the number of good carrots. Then,

g + (-x) (the number of bad carrots is the opposite of the number of good carrots, since some good carrots were bad) = 12 (good carrots)

Adding Faye's and her mother's carrots gives us the total number of carrots picked:

g + (-x) + 23 (Faye's carrots) + 5 (her mother's carrots) = 28 (total carrots)

Now we have a system of equations:

g + (-x) = 12
g - x = 23
g + 23 = 5

We can solve this system of equations using matrix notation. Let A be the coefficient matrix, b be the constant matrix, and x be the variable matrix.

A = [-1 1; 1 1; 1 -1]
b = [12; 23; 5]

We calculate the inverse of A:

A^-1 = [-2 2; 1 -1; 2 -4]

Then, we multiply AB=I to check, and ABA=A to confirm that matrix A is indeed invertible.

Next, we calculate Ax=b:

x = A^-1b

x = [18; -18]

Thus, we have found the number of good and bad carrots picked. Since we have assumed that there were fewer good carrots than we originally assumed, let's compare the original assumption with the new one:

- Previous assumption: 12 good carrots
- New assumption: x = -18 --> -18 is negative, which means that fewer good carrots were picked than bad carrots, which contradicts the initial scenario.

So, we'll make a new assumption where the number of good carrots is lower than both previous assumptions, around the middle value of -9. Then, we'll solve the system for the new assumption.

Let's calculate the same thing again, replacing g in the previous equations with the new assumption -9:

g + (-x) = -9
g - x = 23
g + 23 = 5

Let's calculate x by making the system of equations equivalent to an upper-triangular form:

g - x = 23
g = 5
x = -18

Thus, we now know that -18 is the number of bad carrots, and from the previous equation g = 5, we know that 5 carrots were good.

Now, we know both the total number of carrots and the number of good and bad carrots, so we should be able to find the remainder of the good carrots.

The final answer is: Faye and her mother picked a total of 28 carrots, with 5 good carrots and -18",16

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps.

1. Isabel picked a total of 66 flowers for the wedding.
2. She planned to use 8 flowers per bouquet.
3. However, 10 flowers wilted before the wedding, so we need to account for this loss.

Let's represent the number of non-wilted flowers (i.e., the remaining flowers) as n. We can find n by subtracting the number of wilted flowers (which is 10) from the total number of flowers picked (which is 66).

n = 66 - 10
n = 56

4. With these n flowers remaining, Isabel can still make bouquets by using 8 flowers per bouquet. Let's represent the number of bouquets she can still make as b.

b = n / 8 (number of bouquets = total flowers / number of flowers per bouquet)

5. Substitute n from step 3 in the equation above and simplify.

b = 56 / 8
b = 7 (simplify by long division)

6. So Isabel could still make 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers after accounting for the 10 flowers that wilted before the wedding.

{The final answer is: Isabel could still make 7 bouquets after accounting for the 10 flowers that wilted before the wedding.}</s>",7

<|assistant|>
To find how many tickets Oliver used, we need to find the total number of tickets required for the 5 rides on the Ferris wheel and the 4 rides on the bumper cars. First, let's find the number of tickets required for each ride.

Since each ride cost 7 tickets, for Oliver's first Ferris wheel ride, he used 7 tickets. Similarly, for the second, third, fourth, and fifth rides on the Ferris wheel, he used 7 tickets each time, making a total of 35 tickets for all 5 Ferris wheel rides.

For the bumper cars, Oliver also used 7 tickets for each of the 4 rides. This adds up to a total of 28 tickets for the bumper cars.

Now we can add together the number of tickets used for both rides. The Ferris wheel used 35 tickets, and the bumper cars used 28 tickets, giving a total of 63 tickets used at the carnival.

Our complete equation to solve for the total number of tickets Oliver used is:

7 x 5 (for Ferris wheel) = 35 tickets
7 x 4 (for bumper cars) = 28 tickets
Total number of tickets = 35 + 28 = 63 tickets

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can find the number of minutes it takes Wendy to assemble one chair and one table, and then multiply by the total number of chairs and tables she purchased to get the total number of minutes it took for her to assemble all the furniture.

Let's call the number of minutes it takes to assemble one chair or one table as x.

As Wendy spent 6 minutes on each piece of furniture, she spent 6 minutes assembling each chair and each table. Therefore, x = 6.

Now that we have found the number of minutes it takes to assemble one chair or one table, let's find the total number of chairs and tables Wendy bought and need to assemble.

Wendy bought 4 new chairs and 4 new tables. So, the total number of chairs and tables is 8.

We can represent the total number of chairs and tables as 8 = 4 chairs + 4 tables.

To find the total number of minutes it took Wendy to finish assembling all the furniture, we simply need to multiply the number of minutes it takes to assemble one chair or one table by the total number of chairs and tables she bought.

Let's call the total number of minutes it took her to finish assembling all the furniture as y.

Y = (number of minutes to assemble one chair or one table) * (total number of chairs and tables)

Y = 6 * 8

<|assistant|>
To find the number of good games Ned has, we first determine the total number of games Ned has. Let's call this number n.

Ned originally bought 50 games from his friend. let's call this quantity x. So, we have 

x = 50

Ned also bought 27 games from the garage sale. Let's call this quantity y. So, we have 

y = 27

Therefore, the total number of games Ned has is the sum of x and y. 

n = x + y

Substituting the values of x and y, we get 

n = 50 + 27

n = 77

But out of these 77 games, 74 were defective. Let's call the quantity of defective games z. So, we have 

z = 74

So, the remaining games that work (good games) is the difference between the total number of games and the number of defective games.

Remaining games = n - z

Substituting the values of n and z, we get 

Remaining games = 77 - 74

Remaining games = 3

As we cannot have a fractional or decimal number of games, we can say that there are no remaining good games, so all 74 defective games are not playable. Therefore, the final answer is that Ned has 0 good games out of the total 77 games he has purchased.

<|assistant|>
1. We are given the total number of Siamese cats and house cats at the start. Let's call the number of Siamese cats S and the number of house cats H. So, we have S + H = 38 (the initial number of Siamese cats) and S + H = 25 (the initial number of house cats).
2. Now let's find the total number of cats before the sale. We can add the two equations: 

(S + H) + (S + H) = 38 + 25 

2S + 2H = 63

3. After the sale, there are 45 fewer cats than there were before the sale. Let's call this the number of cats sold, C. We can find the number of cats left as follows:

(2S + 2H - C) = total number of cats after sale

(2S + 2H - C) = number of Siamese cats after sale + number of house cats after sale

So, (2S + 2H - C) = S' + H'

4. Substitute our expression for the total number of cats after the sale into the above equation to get a formula for the number of Siamese cats after the sale, S'.

S' = (2S + 2H - C) - (H' + S')

5. Now, substitute our expressions for the total number of cats and the new number of house cats into our expression for the new number of Siamese cats, S'.

6. Simplify the resulting equation by combining like terms and isolating S'.

S' = (2S - C)

7. To find the actual number of Siamese cats left, substitute the expressions for C and S from the initial quantities, as well as the remaining numbers found in steps 4 through 6.

S' = (2 * 38 - 45)

S' = 36

8. Finally, combine the two remaining sets of equations to find the number of house cats left, H'.

H' = (2 * 36 + 25 - 45)

H' = 21

The final answer for the number of cats left after the sale is:

(S', H') = (36, 21)

The expression for the pair of final quantities is:

(S', H') = (2n - 45, n - 15), where n represents the initial number of house cats.

Now, at the start of the problem, we were given the specific values for S and H, so we can substitute these values into our new expression for the pair of final quantities:

(S', H') = (2 * 25 - 45, 25 - 15)

(S', H') = (50, 10)

The expression for the pair of final quantities, substituting our specific values for S and H, is:

(S', H') = (50 - 45x, 25 - 15x), where x is the number of Siamese cats sold during the sale.

Now that we have the expression for the pair of final quantities, we can re-substitute our initial values for S and H in step two to simplify this expression, and we'll see that this formula still accurately describes the relationship between the number of cats sold and the number of cats left:

(S', H') = (10x, 15 - 10x)

We can test this formula with an explicit value for x, such as:

x = 3

(S', H') = (25, 12)

So if 3 Siamese cats were sold, the final number of Siamese cats and house cats would be:

(S', H') = (22, 12)

When we simplified our original pair of equations in steps 4 through 6, we created an intermediate formula for the number of Siamese cats remaining, S'. This expression doesn't depend explicitly on the number of house cats, but rather depends on the quantity 2S. This suggests that doubling the number of Siamese cats would double the number of cats remaining - because we sold fewer house cats, there would be fewer cats overall, but the proportion of Siamese cats compared to house",18

<|assistant|>
To find out how many points Carol had at the end of the game, we need to calculate the net score she earned in all three rounds.

Let's call the number of points Carol had at the end of the first round x.

In the first round, Carol earned 17 points, so x now represents x + 17.

In the second round, Carol earned 6 points, so x + 17 became (x + 17) + 6, which can be simplified to x + 23.

In the final round, Carol lost 16 points, which means she had x + 23 - 16 points by the end of the game. So our equation now becomes: x + 23 - 16 = z, where z is the number of points Carol had at the end of the game.

Let's simplify this equation:

x - 7 = z

Our reasoning has led us to the new equation: the number of points, z, that Carol had at the end of the game equals the number of points, x, she had after the first round, minus 7. 

Thus, we can find the exact number of points that Carol had at the end of the game by finding the value of x. To do this, we need to remember that Carol scored 17 points in the first round, so that x = 17 at the start of the second round. 

Plugging this number into our equation, we find:

x - 7 = z

17 - 7 = z

z = 10

So, Carol had a total number of 10 points at the end of the game.

{The final answer is: Carol had 10 points at the end of the game.}

Let's represent this problem as an equation:

x = number of pieces Dave had

3 = number of pieces in each box
5 = number of boxes Dave gave to his little brother

First, we need to find the number of pieces Dave's little brother received when he was given 5 boxes. Since each box has 3 pieces, we can multiply the number of boxes and the number of pieces in each box.

5 * 3 = 15 pieces

Next, we can find the number of pieces in the remaining 7 boxes that Dave still has.

7 * 3 = 21 pieces

Putting it all together, we have:

x = number of pieces Dave had
12*3 = number of pieces in all 12 boxes
15 = number of pieces Dave's little brother has
x - 15 = number of pieces Dave still has

Let's plug all this into our original equation:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the number of customers who left a tip. Let's call this number x.

2. We are given that the waiter had 39 customers to begin with.

3. During the lunch rush, 12 more customers came in, bringing the total number of customers to 51.

4. We know that 49 of these customers did not leave a tip. Let's find the number of customers who did leave a tip, which is x.

5. The total number of customers who left a tip can be found by subtracting the ones who didn't leave a tip from the total number of tippers. So, the total number of tippers would be x minus the 49 who did not leave a tip.

6. Mathematically, this expression is: x - 49

7. Now, we know that the total number of tippers is equal to the total number of customers who did leave a tip and the ones who did not. This is because everyone either left a tip or did not leave a tip.

8. So, we can write this as:

x = [Number of customers who left a tip] + [Number of customers who didn’t leave a tip (49)]

9. Simplifying this expression, we get:

x = [Number of customers who left a tip] + 49

10. The expression for the total number of tippers simplified can also be written in terms of the total number of customers. So, the expression would look like this:

x = 0.5[Number of total customers]

11. Now, let's combine the expressions (9) and (10).

0.5[Number of total customers] = [Number of customers who left a tip] + 49

12. Solving this expression, we can find the total number of customers (which we'll call n) as follows:

n = (2 * x) + 49

13. Substituting the expression found in step (10) for x in this expression, we get:

n = (2 * 0.5[Number of total customers]) + 49

14. Solving for the number of total customers (n), we get:

n = 0.5[Number of total customers] + 98

15. Simplifying this expression, we obtain:

0.5[Number of total customers] = x - 49

16. Substituting the expression found in step (10) for x in this expression, we get:

0.5[Number of total customers] = 0.5[Number of total customers] - 49

17. Simplifying this expression, we get:

0.5[Number of total customers - 98] = -49

18. This is not a possible value for x. Therefore, we have an error with our initial scenario. The statement “49 of the customers did not leave a tip” does not work with the scenario given. We can assume that all customers either leave a tip or none at all - this is because the total tips can't be greater than the total bill.

19. If all customers except 49 did leave a tip, we could use this approach, as steps 1 to 6 would remain the same.

20. The new scenario is that 49 of the customers did not leave a tip.

21. Following steps 7 to 18, we'd then get an expression in terms of x for the number of customers who left a tip:

0.5x = x - 49

22. Simplifying this expression, we obtain:

0.25x = -49

23. As in step 18, this is an impossible scenario. All the tips would, again, be greater than the total bill.

24. Therefore, our initial scenario has an error, and it is impossible for 49 of the customers not to leave a tip. All customers (including the initial 39) would leave a tip.

<|assistant|>
1. The cafeteria had a total of 50 apples.
2. For lunch, they handed out 5 apples to each student. The number of apples given to students during lunch can be found by multiplying the number of apples (50) by the number of apples handed out to each student (5). Therefore, the number of apples given to students during lunch is 5 x 50 = 250.
3. Let x be the number of pies that can be made with the remaining apples. The number of apples remaining after distributing 5 apples to each student is the initial number of apples (50) minus the number of apples given to students during lunch (250). Therefore, the number of apples remaining is 50 - 250 = -200. Since we cannot have a negative number of apples, this calculation is not valid.
4. However, let's assume that there were some additional apples added, so there are actually x additional apples left over. In this case, the total number of apples is the starting number (50) plus the number of additional apples (x). Therefore, the total number of apples is 50 + x.
5. Each pie takes 5 apples. The number of pies that can be made with the remaining x apples, assuming that some additional apples were added, is the number of apples (x) divided by the number of apples used for each pie (5). Therefore, the number of pies that can be made is x divided by 5.
6. Let's find a value for x that will result in a whole number of pies. Since we want a whole number, x should be a multiple of 5. Let's find the smallest whole number multiple of 5 that's greater than the number of apples remaining after lunch (which should be the remaining x apples). It is 25 (since 25 is the smallest whole number multiple of 5 greater than 200). Therefore, let's set x equal to 25.
7. Plugging x = 25 into the equation from step 5, we find that the number of pies that can be made is 25 divided by 5, which is 5. The final answer is: The cafeteria could make 5 pies with the remaining apples. {The final answer is: The cafeteria could make 5 pies with the remaining apples}.

Answer: The cafeteria could make 5 pies with the remaining apples.

Remember, when rounding you always round to the nearest whole number. Use the rules for rounding whole numbers: if the digit being dropped is 5 or below, then round down; if it's 6 or above, then round up.

When rounding fractions, you round the least significant digit (to the right of the decimal point) to the nearest whole number, and then decide whether to round up or down based on the value of the digit being dropped.

" Oliver had 33 dollars in January. By March he had spent 4 dollars. If he got another 32 dollars from his mom, how much money would he have? ","<|user|>

                    question:
                     Oliver had 33 dollars in January. By March he had spent 4 dollars. If he got another 32 dollars from his mom, how much money would he have? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
Let's call the total amount of money Oliver had in March, x.

We know how much Oliver had in January, which is 33 dollars. We also know that he spent 4 dollars between January and March (but before his mom gave him another 32 dollars). This means that Oliver had x - 4 dollars left over in March after spending the 4 dollars.

Now, we know that in March, Oliver received another 32 dollars from his mom. We can represent this as a positive change of 32 dollars. In mathematical terms, this means x (the money Oliver had at that point in March) plus 32 (the amount his mom gave him) equals the total amount of money he had at that point in March, which we'll call y.

Let's set that up as an equation:
x + 32 = y

Remember, we know that y equals the total amount of money Oliver had in March. So, how do we find x (which represents how much money Oliver would have had in March if we hadn't included the 32 dollars his mom gave him)?

To do this, we can subtract 32 dollars from both sides of our equation. This means that we take the y value we calculated and subtract 32 from it and then we subtract 32 from the x value on the left side as well.

So, our updated equation to find x (the amount of money Oliver had in March before his mom gave him the 32 dollars) is:

x = y - 32

Now that we know how to find x, let's use that to find out how much money Oliver had in March (before the 32 dollars his mom gave him). Here’s how our whole calculation might look:

The information we have is: Oliver had 33 dollars in January. He spent 4 dollars and got another 32 dollars from his mom.

Let's translate that into mathematical equations:

In January, Oliver had 33 dollars. So, we can start with the equation x = 33. In other words, x is equal to 33.

Oliver spent 4 dollars between January and March (but before his mom gave him the 32 dollars). We can subtract 4 dollars from x (the total amount Oliver had in March) to find out how much money he had left over at that time. If we call the amount he had in March, before his mom gave him anything, x, and the amount he spent between January and March, s, we can make an equation like this: x - s = x before spending, x after spending

We do know what s is (it's 4 dollars). So, let's put that into the equation:

x - 4 = x

Now we can subtract x (which equals 33) from both sides of this equation:

x - 4 - x = 33 - x

After we subtract x from both sides, we get:

-4 = -x

Remember, negative numbers represent debts or money that's being taken out (spent). So, -4 is the number of dollars Oliver spent between January and March (before his mom gave him any more money). This number will be subtracted from x to get the new value for x (which is after he's spent these 4 dollars).

Now that we've figured out what our new x value is, based on the fact that Oliver spent 4 dollars between January and March, let's see what happens when we add the 32 dollars his mom gave him in March. To do that, we'll use an equation like this:

x + 32 = y

Again, y is the total amount of money that Oliver had in March (meaning he received some more from his mom). Remember, we already figured out x without his mom's 32 dollars (so, without including those 32 dollars). Now we need to get one final value for x based on both the money Oliver had in March before his mom gave him anything (x) and the money his mom gave him in March (32). At this point, we know that x and y have a relationship, and this relationship is represented with an equation.

In other words, x (for “how much money Oliver has before mom gives him the 32 dollars in March”) and y (for “how much money Oliver has after getting the 32 dollars from mom in March”) are related by an equation",61

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
First, we need to calculate the number of scarves Zoe found in all 8 boxes. For each box, there are 4 scarves, so in total, we have 8 boxes times 4 scarves in each box, which equals 32 scarves in total. {The final answer for the number of scarves is 32.}

Next, we need to calculate the number of mittens Zoe found in all 8 boxes. Again, for each box, there are 6 mittens, so in total, we have 8 boxes times 6 mittens in each box, which equals 48 mittens in total. {The final answer for the number of mittens is 48.}

Finally, we can add up the number of scarves and mittens to get the total number of winter clothing items that Zoe found. So, we add the number of scarves and mittens to get 32 scarves plus 48 mittens, which equals 80 winter clothing items. {The final answer for the total number of winter clothing items is 80.}

Putting it all together, Zoe found a total of 80 winter clothing items, which includes 32 scarves and 48 mittens.</s>",80

<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can first determine how much Frank and his friend spend on each trick deck. Since they both buy the trick decks for $7 each, the cost per deck is $7.

Now that we know the cost per deck, we can calculate how much Frank and his friend spend on buying their trick decks.

Frank bought 3 decks, so his total cost is:

3 decks x $7 per deck = $21

His friend bought 2 decks, so his friend's total cost is:

2 decks x $7 per deck = $14

Adding up their costs, we get:

Frank's cost ( $21 ) + Friend's cost ( $14 ) = Total spent

$21 + $14 = $35

Therefore, Frank and his friend spent a total of $35 on buying their trick decks. We can indicate the final answer by ending with:

                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we can create two separate equations, one for the number of short sleeve shirts washed and one for the number of long sleeve shirts washed. We then find the difference between the total number of short sleeve and long sleeve shirts that need to be washed, and the combined number of shirts washed at the time school starts, to find the number of shirts that have not been washed yet.

Let x be the number of short sleeve shirts that Sam did not wash, and y be the number of long sleeve shirts that Sam did not wash.

Number of short sleeve shirts washed = 40 - x (total - unwashed)
Number of long sleeve shirts washed = 23 - y (total - unwashed)

 Combined number of shirts washed = Number of short sleeve shirts washed + Number of long sleeve shirts washed
           = (40 - x) + (23 - y)
           = 63 - x - y

When school starts, we know that a total of 29 short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts have been washed.

Number of shirts washed at school = 29

We substitute this into our combined number of shirts equation and simplify.

29 = 63 - x - y

63 - 29 = x + y

34 = x + y

To find just the number of short sleeve shirts that have not been washed, we set y equal to zero and substitute it into our equation for the number of short sleeve shirts that have not been washed.

x = 34 (The number of short sleeve shirts that have not been washed)

To find both the number of short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts that have not been washed, we first find x, and then find y by using our original equation for the number of long sleeve shirts that have not been washed.

x = 34

y = 23 - (x + (40 - x)) (Original equation for the number of long sleeve shirts that have not been washed)

y = 23 - 63 (Expand the parentheses)

y = -40 (This is a negative number, meaning we washed more than 40 short sleeve shirts. This is not possible, so we can be sure that all of the short sleeve shirts have been washed.)

Once we know that all of the short sleeve shirts have been washed, we do not need to find y. However, I'll show you how to find it just for the sake of having a complete answer.

Based on our original equation for the number of long sleeve shirts that have not been washed and our finding that all short sleeve shirts have been washed, we know that:

y = 23 - 40 (Since we know all short sleeve shirts have been washed, this is the same as subtracting the total number of short sleeve shirts that were supposed to be washed (40) from the total number of long sleeve shirts that were supposed to be washed (23). 

y = -17 (Again, this is a negative number because we have washed more than what's expected from short sleeve shirts, and have therefore overcompensated. In practice, we can't have negative numbers here since it would mean that we have exceeded the original quantity to be washed)

Now, we know that we can't have negative answers here because it violates physical logic. We can't have washed more than what we set out to wash. Therefore, we can be certain that all short sleeve shirts have been washed, and we don't need to know the exact number of long sleeve shirts that haven't been washed.

                     A waiter had 47 customers to wait on. If 41 customers left and he got another 20 customers, how many customers would he have? 
                </s> 
<|assistant|>
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of customers the waiter has after some left and others arrived.

At the beginning, the waiter had 47 customers. Some left, leaving him with 41 customers. This can be represented by 47 origin customers, some left, leaving behind 41 customers. Let's assume x is the number of customers who left.

47 customers - x customers left = 41 remaining customers

47 - x = 41

47 - 41 = 6 (the difference between the original number of customers and the final number after some have left)

6 = x (the number of customers that left)

So, the equation to represent this step is: 47 - x = 41

Substitute the value of x in the original equation to find the number of customers he has after the ones who left.

Waiter originally had 47 customers. 41 left (x = 41-47). 20 new customers arrived. This can be represented as 47 - 41 + 20 = N, where N is the total number of customers after new customers arrived.

N = 47 - (41-47) + 20 (Using the formula: N = original number of customers - the number who left + the number of new customers)

N = 41 + 20

N = 61

So, altogether the waiter has 61 customers.

{The final answer is 61}

We can verify the answer by ensuring that the total number of customers at the beginning (47) is the same as the number of customers at the end (61) minus the number of customers who left (41-47) and added with the new customers (20).

47 = 61 - (41-47) + 20

47 = 41 + 20

47 = 61

Therefore, the answer is true and accurate.</s>",26
