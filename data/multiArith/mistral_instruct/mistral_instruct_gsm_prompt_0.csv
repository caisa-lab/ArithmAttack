                    question:
                     Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player? 
                 [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:
1. Paige started with 11 songs on her mp3 player.
2. She deleted 9 old songs, so now we have to find out how many songs she has left after deleting those 9.
3. Subtraction of deleted songs from the initial number of songs: 11 (initial) - 9 (deleted) = 2 songs
4. Paige then added 8 new songs to her mp3 player.
5. To find out how many songs she has now, we add the remaining songs after deletion to the new added songs.

The final answer is: 2 (remaining) + 8 (added) = 10 songs.</s>",10

                 [/INST] To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we first need to determine how many students were called back, and then subtract that number from the total number of students who tried out.

1. We know that there were 39 girls and 4 boys who tried out for the basketball team, so the total number of students who tried out is: 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students {The total number of students who tried out was 43}.

2. We're told that only 26 students were called back.

3. To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we subtract the number of students who were called back from the total number of students who tried out: 43 - 26 = 17 students {The final answer is: 17 students didn't make the cut}.</s>",17

                     Faye had 34 coloring books. If she gave away 3 of them, but then bought 48 more, how many would she have total? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Faye started with 34 coloring books.
Step 2: She gave away 3 coloring books, so we need to subtract those from her original number.
34 (initial number) - 3 (given away) = 31

Step 3: Faye then bought 48 more coloring books. We need to add these to the number she had after giving some away.
31 (remaining after giving some away) + 48 (newly purchased) = 79

The final answer is: Faye has a total of 79 coloring books.</s>",79

                 [/INST] Step 1: The school cafeteria had 23 apples.

Step 2: They used 20 apples for making lunches for the students, so there are now 23 - 20 = <<23-20=3>>3 apples left.

Step 3: They bought 6 more apples, so the total number of apples they now have is 3 + 6 = <<3+6=9>>9 apples.

                 [/INST] To find the number of points earned by defeating the enemies in the video game, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of enemies defeated:
You defeated 11 enemies in total, but you only defeated 8 of them (you spared 3). So, you defeated 8 enemies.

2. Find the score obtained by defeating all enemies:
You earn 9 points for each enemy defeated.

3. Calculate the total points earned by defeating all enemies in the level:
Total points earned = Points per enemy × Number of enemies defeated
Total points earned = 9 × 8 = 72 points

                 [/INST] Step 1: Megan earns 8 points for each bag of cans she recycles.

Step 2: Megan had 14 bags of cans.

Step 3: However, she didn't recycle 5 of those bags. So, the number of bags she actually recycled is 14 - 5 = 9 bags.

Step 4: Therefore, the total number of points Megan earned is 9 bags * 8 points/bag = 72 points.

{The final answer is: Megan earned 72 points.}

Note that we calculated the number of points Megan earned by multiplying the number of bags she recycled by the number of points earned per bag.</s>",72

                     April's discount flowers was having a sale where each rose was 4 dollars. If April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left, how much money did she earn? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: April started with 13 roses and each rose cost 4 dollars. So, the total cost of the roses she initially bought was:
13 roses * $4/rose = $52

Step 2: April had 4 roses left, so she sold 9 roses during the sale. The total earnings from selling these roses were:
9 roses * $4/rose = $36

Step 3: To find the net earnings, subtract the initial investment from the earnings.
Net earnings = Earnings - Initial investment
Net earnings = $36 - $52
Net earnings = -$16

However, the net earnings cannot be negative. This means April did not earn any money from the sale, but instead, she lost $16.

{The final answer is: April lost $16 on the sale.}</s>",36
" Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? ","<s> [INST]

                    question:
                     Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? 
                 [/INST] To determine how many shirts Ned did not wash, we first need to find out how many shirts he washed and how many he had in total.

1. Ned had 9 short sleeve shirts. He washed 29 of them, so the number of short sleeve shirts he washed is: 9 (short sleeve shirts) × 29 (washed) = 261 short sleeve shirts were washed.
2. Ned also had 21 long sleeve shirts. However, the problem states that he had only washed 29 shirts by the time school started. Since all the short sleeve shirts were washed and there were 21 long sleeve shirts, it's safe to assume that all 21 long sleeve shirts were also washed since they were not mentioned otherwise.

Therefore, Ned washed a total of 261 shirts (21 long sleeve shirts + 240 short sleeve shirts).

3. According to the problem, Ned had a total of 9 short sleeve shirts + 21 long sleeve shirts = 29 shirts. Therefore, he didn't wash 29 - 261 = 232 shirts.

{The final answer is: 232 shirts were not washed.}</s>",1

                    question:
                     A company invited 47 people to a luncheon, but 7 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 5 people each, how many tables do they need? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many people actually showed up at the luncheon.
The number of people who attended is the total number of invited guests minus the number who didn't show up, so:
Attendees = Invited people - Absentees
= 47 - 7
= 40

Step 2: Determine how many people can sit at one table.
According to the problem statement, each table can accommodate 5 people.

Step 3: Calculate how many tables are needed to seat all the attendees.
Number of tables = Number of attendees / Capacity per table
= 40 / 5
= 8

However, since seats at a table are arranged in a square or round pattern, it's unlikely that exactly 5 people can be seated at a long table. Also, you might want to round the number of tables up to ensure everyone has a seat. For that reason, let's say they need 9 tables to comfortably seat everyone.

{The final answer is: They need 9 tables.}</s>",8
" Tom had 5 books. If he sold 4 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Tom have? ","<s> [INST] 
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Tom had 5 books. If he sold 4 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Tom have? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Tom initially had 5 books.

Step 2: Tom sold 4 books, so he had 5 - 4 =  <b>1</b> book left.

Step 3: Tom used the money he earned from selling 4 books to buy new books. The number of new books he bought is stated to be 38.

Step 4: First, let's find out how much money Tom earned by selling 4 books. Since Tom initially had 5 books and he sold 4, the price of each book should be determined first. Let's assume each book was sold for $x. Then:

5 books * $x = Initial total amount
4 books * $x = Money earned from selling 4 books

To find the price of each book ($x), we can set up the equation:

initial total amount = money earned from selling 4 books + 38 new books
5 * $x = 4 * $x + 38

Solving for x, we get:

$x = $39 (Tom made a profit of $34 from selling each book)

Step 5: Tom used $39 to buy 38 new books.

Step 6: To find the total number of books Tom now has, add the remaining book and the 38 new books:

Total number of books = 1 (remaining book) + 38 (new books)

{The final answer is: Tom has a total of 39 books.}

Alternatively, the easier calculation would be:
Tom started with 5 books, sold 4 and bought back 38:
Total number of books = 5-4+38 = 41. But since Tom had only one book left after selling, the answer is incorrect. In fact, Tom has 39 books.</s>",39
" For a birthday party Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 9 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up? ","<s> [INST]

                     For a birthday party Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 9 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Jerry's fridge would fill up, we first need to determine the total number of sodas he bought and then divide this number by the number of sodas that can be stored on each shelf.

1. Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas.
2. The total number of sodas Jerry bought is: 41 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 63 sodas
3. Each shelf can hold 9 sodas.
4. To find out how many shelves he would fill up, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold: 63 sodas / 9 sodas per shelf = 7.0
5. Since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, Jerry would need to reserve one shelf for the remaining 3 sodas and would use 8 shelves in total.

{The final answer is: Jerry would need 8 shelves to store all the sodas in his fridge.}</s>",7

                     For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had 32 pieces of candy while her sister had 42. If they ate 35 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many pieces of candy Debby and her sister had in total before they ate any.
The total amount of candy Debby and her sister had was 32 (Debby's candy) + 42 (sister's candy) = 74 pieces.

Step 2: Determine how many pieces of candy they ate the first night.
They ate 35 pieces together.

Step 3: Determine how many pieces of candy are left.
To find out how many pieces of candy are left, subtract the number of pieces they ate from the total amount of candy they had.
74 (total candy) - 35 (candy eaten) = 39 pieces of candy are left.

{The final answer is 39 pieces of candy remaining.}</s>",39
 Emily was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 41 seeds and planted 29 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 4 seeds each. How many small gardens did Emily have? ,"<s> [INST]

                    question:
                     Emily was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 41 seeds and planted 29 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 4 seeds each. How many small gardens did Emily have? 
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into steps:

1. Emily started with 41 seeds in total.
2. She planted 29 seeds in the big garden.
3. She put 4 seeds in each of the small gardens.

First, let's find out how many seeds were used in the small gardens:

Seeds in small gardens = Total seeds - Seeds in big garden
= 41 seeds - 29 seeds
= 12 seeds

Since Emily put 4 seeds in each small garden:

Number of small gardens = Total seeds in small gardens / Seeds per small garden
= 12 seeds / 4 seeds
= 3 small gardens

However, we made an error. We assumed that Emily put all remaining seeds in the small gardens. But the question doesn't specify that. The problem states that Emily ""put 4 seeds each"" in the small gardens, which might be implied to mean that she has that many in each small garden. Therefore, we need to recalculate the number of seeds left after planting 29 seeds in the big gardens:

Remaining seeds = Total seeds - Planted seeds
= 41 seeds - 29 seeds
= 12 seeds

In this case, we can confirm that Emily had 3 small gardens with 4 seeds each.

{The final answer is: Emily had 3 small gardens.}</s>",3
" For Halloween Emily received 5 pieces of candy from neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 9 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her? ","<s> [INST]

                     For Halloween Emily received 5 pieces of candy from neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 9 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total amount of candy Emily received.
Total candy = Candy from neighbors + Candy from older sister
= 5 pieces + 13 pieces
= 18 pieces

Step 2: Determine how many days it would take for Emily to finish the candy eating 9 pieces a day.
Days = Total candy / Pieces eaten per day
= 18 pieces / 9 pieces per day
= approximately 2 days with remainder (approximately because 18/9 = 2 with a remainder of 3)

Since Emily cannot eat a fraction of a candy piece, she can consume the remaining 3 pieces on the last day, and the rest of the candy will last her 2 full days.

{The final answer is: The candy will last Emily 2 full days.}</s>",2

Total books: 82
Books taken by the librarian: 10
Books left for Mike: 82 - 10 = 72

Step 2: Determine how many books can be put on one shelf.
Books per shelf: 9

Step 3: Determine how many shelves Mike will need to store all the remaining books.
Number of shelves: Total books left for Mike / Books per shelf = 72 / 9
Number of shelves = 8

Since Mike can't have a fraction of a shelf, he will need to round up and use 9 shelves in total to store all 72 books.

Step 2: They threw away 25 old oranges, so we subtract 25 from the initial number of oranges: 40 oranges - 25 thrown away = 15 new oranges in the bin.
Step 3: Then, they added 21 new oranges to the bin.
Step 4: We find the total number of oranges in the bin by adding the number of new oranges to the number that remained after they threw away the old ones: 15 new oranges + 21 new oranges = 36 oranges in the bin.

                     A group of 4 friends went into a restaurant. The chef already had 9 chicken wings cooked but cooked 7 more for the group. If they each got the same amount how many would each person get? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many chicken wings each person got, we need to determine the total number of chicken wings the group of 4 friends received.

1. The chef had 9 chicken wings cooked before the friends arrived.
2. The chef cooked 7 more chicken wings for the group.
3. So, in total, the group received 9 (cooked before they arrived) + 7 (cooked for them) = <ins>16</ins> chicken wings.

Now, if each of the 4 friends got the same amount, we can find out how many chicken wings that is by dividing the total number of chicken wings (16) by the number of friends (4):

1. <ins>16 / 4 = 4</ins>. This means that each friend received 4 chicken wings.

Therefore, {The final answer is: Each friend received 4 chicken wings.}</s>",4

1. John forgot to mow 7 lawns out of 15. Therefore, the number of lawns he did mow is:
   Lawns mowed = Total lawns - Lawns not mowed
   = 15 lawns - 7 lawns
   = 8 lawns

2. We know that John earned $8 for each lawn he mowed. So, to calculate his actual earnings, we multiply the number of lawns he mowed by the amount he earned per lawn:
   Actual earnings = Lawns mowed × Earnings per lawn
   = 8 lawns × $8/lawn

The shelter had 5 puppies initially, and then 35 more were brought in.
Total number of puppies = Initial number of puppies + Newly arrived puppies
Total number of puppies = 5 + 35 = 40

Step 2: We know that 8 puppies are adopted each day.

Step 3: We want to find out how many days it takes for all the puppies to be adopted. We can calculate this by dividing the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Number of days = Total number of puppies / Number of puppies adopted per day
Number of days = 40 / 8

Step 4: Perform the division:
Number of days = 5

Number of adults = Total people - Number of kids
Number of adults = 13 - 9
Number of adults = 4

Now that we know there are 4 adults, we can calculate the total cost for the group. Since each adult meal costs $7, the total cost would be:

Total cost = Number of adults * Cost per adult meal
Total cost = 4 * $7
Total cost = $28

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Rachel scores 9 points for each treasure she finds.

Step 2: On the first level, she found 5 treasures. So, we calculate her points for the first level: Points on level 1 = Number of treasures * Points per treasure
Points on level 1 = 5 treasures * 9 points per treasure
Points on level 1 = 45 points

Step 3: On the second level, she found 2 treasures. So, we calculate her points for the second level: Points on level 2 = Number of treasures * Points per treasure
Points on level 2 = 2 treasures * 9 points per treasure
Points on level 2 = 18 points

Step 4: To calculate Rachel's total score, we add her points on level 1 and level 2: Total score = Points on level 1 + Points on level 2
Total score = 45 points + 18 points

1. We know that the waiter had 26 customers during the initial lunch rush.
2. Then, 27 more customers arrived.
3. However, 27 of these customers didn't leave a tip.
4. So, we need to find out how many customers did leave a tip.
5. To do this, we subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers.
6. Therefore, the total number of customers who left a tip is: 26 (initial customers) + 27 (arrived customers) = 53 customers
7. Subtracting the 27 customers who didn't leave a tip from this number, we get: 53 (total customers) - 27 (no tip customers) = 26 customers

                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves were used, we first need to find out how many bears were in stock after the shipment arrived.

1. The toy store had 17 bears in stock before the shipment.
2. They received a shipment with 10 bears, so the total number of bears is now: 17 + 10 = 27 bears
3. Each shelf holds 9 bears, so we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears that can fit on one shelf to find out how many shelves were used: 27 / 9
4. {The final answer is 3 shelves}. However, since a shelf cannot hold a fraction of bears, the store would need to use 4 shelves to accommodate all 27 bears, with a few bears left over on the last shelf. So, the actual answer depends on what the store decides to do with the remaining bears. In practice, most stores would rather fill a shelf completely and order a few extra in the next shipment.

                 [/INST] let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Wendy uploaded a total of 79 pictures.
2. She put 44 pictures into one album. So, the number of pictures in the first album is 44.
3. The remaining pictures were distributed among 5 different albums.
4. Let's denote the number of pictures in each of the 5 albums as x, y, z, w, and v.
5. We know that the number of pictures in the first album is 44, and the number of pictures in all other 5 albums together is 79 - 44 = 35.
6. Since there are 5 albums, we have the equation: x + y + z + w + v = 35.
7. To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to find the integer values of x, y, z, w, and v that satisfy this equation.

Unfortunately, without more information, we can't determine the unique solution to this problem. The equation could have many different solutions, as there are many ways to divide 35 pictures among 5 albums. For example, it could be 5 albums with 7 pictures each, or 4 albums with 8 pictures each and 1 with 7, and so on.

So, we cannot definitively say what the number of pictures were in each of the five albums without more information.

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups of 9 the schools debate team can make, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group and account for the fact that there's a remainder of boys. Here are the steps:

1. First, let's find the total number of students: 5 boys * 5 = 25 boys and 40 girls = 45 girls. The total number of students is 25 boys + 45 girls = 70 students.

2. Next, let's try dividing the total number of students (70) by the size of a group (9). The quotient can be found by doing the division 70 ÷ 9 which equals approximately 7 with a remainder of 5.

3. However, since groups cannot consist of a fraction of students, we need to account for this remainder by creating a smaller group. Let's see how many students a group with 8 instead of 9 can accommodate: A group of 8 can have 8 students + 1 = 9 students.

4. Now, let's calculate the number of full groups of size 9: 70 ÷ 9 ≈ 7.7 or 7 entire groups, plus one group of 8.

5. So, the schools debate team can make a total of 7 full groups of 9 students and 1 group of 8 students.

1. We know that April started with 9 roses and had 4 roses left. So the number of roses she bought or sold is the difference between these two quantities:

Number of roses = (Initial number of roses) - (Final number of roses)
Number of roses = 9 - 4
Number of roses = 5
2. Each rose cost 7 dollars, so to find out how much money April earned, we need to multiply the number of roses by the price of each rose:

                     A pet store had 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats. During a sale they sold 10 cats. How many cats do they have left? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many cats the pet store has left after the sale, we first need to determine how many of each type of cat were sold. We know that there were originally 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats, and they sold 10 cats in total.

Let's assume that x number of siamese cats and y number of house cats were sold. We know that x + y = 10, since a total of 10 cats were sold.

Now, let's find out how many cats of each type were sold. To do this, we can use the following system of linear equations:

Siamese cats: 13 - x
House cats: 5 - y
Total cats: 18 - (x + y)

We know that x + y = 10, so we can rewrite the equation as follows:

x + y = 10
2x + 2y = 20 (multiplied by 2 to get rid of the fractions)

Now we have a system of linear equations with two variables: 2x + 2y = 20 and x + y = 10. We can solve this system using substitution or elimination method, but in this case, it is easier to use the elimination method.

To do this, we'll first multiply the first equation by 1 and the second equation by 1 but then multiply the second equation by 2:

2x + 2y = 20
2(x + y) = 2(10)
2x + 2y = 20
2x + 2y = 20 (Eliminated y)
2x = 20 - 2y

Now we have 2x = 20 - 2y, so x = (20 - 2y)/2. Since we know x is an integer, we can try various values for y:

If y = 5, then x = (20 - 2(5))/2 = 3
So, 3 Siamese cats and 5 house cats were sold.

The total number of cats remaining is:
13 (Siamese cats) - 3 (sold) + 5 (House cats) - 5 (sold) = 11

Therefore, {The final answer is}: The pet store has 11 cats left.</s>",8

                 [/INST] Step 1: Megan baked a total of 71 cupcakes.

Step 2: Todd ate 43 of those cupcakes, so there are now 71 - 43 = <ins>28</ins> cupcakes left.

Step 3: Megan puts 7 cupcakes in each package. So, the number of packages she can make is 28 ÷ 7.

Step 4: The division operation results in {Approximately 4 packages}.

However, since we cannot make a fraction of a package, Megan can make 4 full packages and will have 3 remaining cupcakes which can be considered as an extra.

So, the final answer is {Megan can make 4 full packages and 1 extra package of cupcakes}.</s>",4

Step 2: Then 2 more players join the game, increasing the number of players by 2. So now there are 2 (initial friends) + 2 (new players) = 4 players in total.

Step 3: We are told that each player had 6 lives, so to find the total number of lives for all players, we need to multiply the number of players by the number of lives each player has:
Total lives = Number of players * Lives per player

Step 4: Plugging in the values from our previous steps:
Total lives = 4 players * 6 lives/player
Total lives = 24 lives

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many bouquets Wendy made with the 103 flowers, before any wilted.
Since each bouquet contained 8 flowers, we divide the total number of flowers (103) by the number of flowers in a bouquet (8).
{The number of bouquets Wendy made before wilted flowers: 103/8 = 13.0625}

Step 2: Calculate how many bouquets were affected by the wilted flowers (47).
{The number of bouquets with wilted flowers: 47}

Step 3: Subtract the number of bouquets with wilted flowers from the total number of bouquets made before wilted flowers to find out how many bouquets could still be made.
{The final answer is: 13 - 47/8 = 12.40625. Since we cannot make a fraction of a bouquet, we will round down to 12.}

Therefore, Wendy could still make 12 bouquets with her remaining fresh flowers.</s>",7

                 [/INST] Solution:

1. First, let's determine the total number of people in Nancy's class going on the field trip. We have 12 students, which is equal to 12 people, and 3 adults, which is equal to 3 people. So, the total number of people is: 12 students + 3 adults = 15 people.

2. Next, we need to find out how many people each van can hold. We know that each van can hold 5 people.

3. To determine how many vans they will need, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each van can hold: 
number_of_vans = total_number_of_people / number_of_people_per_van
number_of_vans = 15 / 5

4. Performing the division, we get: number_of_vans = 3. So, they will need 3 vans to transport everyone in Nancy's class to the zoo.

                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Tom would need to fill up, we first need to determine how many sodas he bought in total and then calculate how many sodas can be stored on each shelf.

1. Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. In total, he bought 4 + 52 = <<4+52=56>>56 sodas.
2. Each shelf can hold 7 sodas. So the number of shelves required is the quotient of the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.
3. Number of shelves = Total number of sodas / Sodas per shelf
4. Number of shelves = 56 / 7
5. Since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, we need to find the nearest integer value: 
6. Number of shelves = ceil(56/7) = <<ceil(56/7)=8.211222122212213=>8 (since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf).

                 [/INST] To find out how many trips Luke makes, we need to determine the number of trips required to pick up the trays from each table and then add the two numbers together.

First, let's find out how many trips Luke needs to make to pick up all the trays from the first table:

Trips for table 1 = Number of trays on table 1 / Number of trays Luke can carry at a time
= 20 trays / 4 trays per trip
= 5 trips

Next, let's find out how many trips Luke needs to make to pick up all the trays from the second table:

Trips for table 2 = Number of trays on table 2 / Number of trays Luke can carry at a time
= 16 trays / 4 trays per trip
= 4 trips

Finally, let's find out how many trips Luke makes in total to pick up all the trays:

Total trips = Trips for table 1 + Trips for table 2
= 5 trips + 4 trips
= 9 trips

Apples left = Total apples - Apples given to students
= 96 apples - 42 apples
= 54 apples

Step 2: Next, we'll determine how many pies they can make with the remaining apples. We know that each pie takes 6 apples.

Pies made = Apples left / Apples per pie
= 54 apples / 6 apples/pie
= 9 pies (approximately)

Since they cannot make a fraction of a pie, they can only make 9 pies with the given number of apples.

1. Henry had 3 action figures, but he needed 8 in total. So, he was missing 5 action figures.

Henry was missing 5 action figures, and each one costs $6:

2. To find the total cost of the action figures Henry needs to buy, multiply the number of action figures he's missing by their cost per piece.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how much money Frank has in total.
Frank had savings of 3 dollars. He received an additional 37 dollars for his allowance, so he now has:

Total money = Savings + Allowance
Total money = 3 + 37
Total money = 3 + 37 $
Total money = 40 $

Step 2: Divide the total amount of money Frank has by the cost of an 8 dollar toy to determine how many toys he can buy.
Number of toys = Total money / Cost of each toy
Number of toys = 40 $ / 8 $
Number of toys = 5 toys

However, since we cannot buy a fraction of a toy, Frank can only buy 5 toys with a total cost of 40 dollars.

1. Vanessa picked 17 carrots, and her mother picked 14 carrots.
2. To find the combined number of carrots picked by Vanessa and her mother, we add their individual counts: 17 (Vanessa) + 14 (her mother) = 31

3. However, the problem states that there were only 24 carrots in total in the garden. So, we need to find out how many carrots were bad.
4. To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the total number of carrots picked by Vanessa and her mother from the total number of carrots in the garden: 24 (total carrots) - 31 (carrots picked) = -7

The negative number indicates an error in the problem statement, as it doesn't make sense for there to be a negative number of carrots. It's likely that there is an error or inconsistency in the problem statement that needs further investigation or correction.

Therefore, the final answer is: The problem statement contains an inconsistency or error, and it isn't possible to use the provided information to determine the number of bad carroets.</s>",7

4. To find the number of cups of flour she still needs, we subtract the number of cups of flour she has used from the total number of cups of flour she needs for her party.
5. Total cups of flour needed = Number of brownies needed * Cups of flour per brownie
6. Total cups of flour needed = 17 brownies * 8 cups/brownie = 136 cups
7. Cups of flour used = 8 brownies * 8 cups/brownie = 64 cups

Step 2: He spent 11 dollars on new mower blades.
Step 3: To find out how many 2 dollar games Frank can buy, we need to find out how much money he had left after spending on the mower blades.
Step 4: Subtract the amount Frank spent on the mower blades from the total amount he made.

Final calculation: 19 dollars (total amount) - 11 dollars (amount spent on mower blades) = 8 dollars

                 [/INST] To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group:

Total number of players = New players + Returning players
Total number of players = 48 + 6
Total number of players = 54

Number of players in each group = 6

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players per group
Number of groups = 54 / 6
Number of groups = 9 with a remainder of 0

Since a group cannot have a fraction of a player, we cannot have a ninth group with 54 players, and we must have exactly nine groups with six players each. However, since there are actually 54 players, the last group will have six players, and the previous group will have two additional players:

Therefore, there will be eight groups of six players, and the ninth group will have two extra players, making the total number of players in the nine groups 56.

{However, the problem states that there are 48 new players and 6 returning players, which totals 54. Since it is not possible to have nine groups of six players and an additional pair of players, this problem may contain an error or inconsistency.}

1. Nancy had 80 files initially.
2. She deleted 31 files, leaving her with 80 - 31 = 49 files.
3. Nancy put the remaining files into folders, with each folder containing 7 files.
4. To determine the number of folders, we need to divide the total number of files by the number of files per folder: 49 files / 7 files per folder = 7 folders with one extra file.
5. Since Nancy cannot have a folder with only one file, she would have to create one more folder for the last file.

Step 1: Calculate the number of games Luke had left after selling 19 games.
Luke started out with 39 games. He sold 19 games, so:
Number of games left = Initial number of games - Number of games sold
= 39 - 19
= 20 games

Step 2: Divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box to determine the number of boxes needed.
Number of boxes = Number of games ÷ Games per box
= 20 ÷ 4
= 5 boxes

Therefore, {The final answer is}: Luke used 5 boxes to pack the rest of his games.</s>",5

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many students were picked for the teams.
The total number of students trying out was 65, and 17 of them weren't picked. So, the number of students picked for the teams is:
65 students trying out - 17 students not picked = 48 students picked

Step 2: Divide the number of students picked by the number of groups.
There are 8 groups, so we need to divide the number of students picked by 8.

Number of students in each group = Students picked / Number of groups
Number of students in each group = 48 students / 8 groups

Step 3: Calculate the number of students in each group.
To calculate the number of students in each group, we divide the number of students picked by the number of groups:

Number of students in each group = 48 students / 8 groups
Number of students in each group = 6 students

Now let's calculate how many pictures were in each of the 5 different albums:

1. We know that Isabel put 10 pictures into one album, leaving 15 pictures for the 5 different albums.
2. To divide the 15 remaining pictures equally among the 5 albums, we first need to find out how many pictures will be in each album by calculating the quotient of the total number of remaining pictures by the number of albums.

Number of pictures in each album = Total remaining pictures / Number of albums

Number of pictures in each album = 15 / 5

Number of pictures in each album = 3

So, Isabel put 3 pictures in each of the 5 different albums.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 4 friends playing the game, so they had:
   Lives of friends = 4 * Lives per friend
2. Then, 5 more players joined the game, so they added:
   Lives of new players = 5 * Lives per player
3. To find the total number of lives, we simply add the lives of the friends and the new players:
   Total lives = Lives of friends + Lives of new players

Now, let's find the values for each part of the problem. We know that:

- Each friend had 3 lives.
- 5 new players joined.
- Each player (friend or new) had 3 lives.

So, we can calculate as follows:

Lives of friends = 4 * 3 = 12
Lives of new players = 5 * 3 = 15
Total lives = 12 + 15 = 27

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many points Gwen earned for recycling 5 pounds.
 Since Gwen earns 1 point for every 3 pounds recycled, we first need to find out how many full 3-pound increments there are in 5 pounds.
 3 pounds * (number of full increments) = 5 pounds
 Dividing both sides by 3: number of full increments = (5 pounds) / 3
 number of full increments ≈ 1.67 (rounded)
 Since there cannot be a fraction of a 3-pound increment, Gwen has recycled 1 full 3-pound increment plus 1 additional pound. So she gets 1 point.

Step 2: Determine how many points Gwen's friends earned for recycling 13 pounds.
 Similar to Step 1, we'll find the number of full 3-pound increments in 13 pounds and determine how many points her friends earn.
 3 pounds * (number of full increments) = 13 pounds
 Dividing both sides by 3: number of full increments = (13 pounds) / 3 ≈ 4.33 (rounded)
 Given that every 3 pounds earns 1 point, her friends earned 4 full increments and thus 4 points.

Step 3: Calculate the total points earned by Gwen and her friends.
 Since Gwen earned 1 point and her friends earned 4 points, the total points earned is 1 + 4 = {5 points}

                 [/INST] Step 1: Each cage contains 8 parrots. So, the number of parrots in the pet store is:
Number of Parrots = Number of Cages * Parrots per Cage
Number of Parrots = 4 * 8
Number of Parrots = 32

Step 2: Each cage also contains 2 parakeets. So, the number of parakeets in the pet store is:
Number of Parakeets = Number of Cages * Parakeets per Cage
Number of Parakeets = 4 * 2
Number of Parakeets = 8

Step 3: To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we add the number of parrots and parakeets:

                    question:
                     Robin uploaded 31 pictures from her phone and 5 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 9 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many pictures were in each album, we first need to find out how many pictures Robin has in total. She uploaded 31 pictures from her phone and 5 pictures from her camera, so:

Total pictures = Pictures from phone + Pictures from camera
Total pictures = 31 + 5
Total pictures = 36

Now, we want to sort these pictures into 9 albums with the same number of pictures in each album. To do this, we need to find out how many pictures will be in each album:

Number of pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Number of pictures per album = 36 / 9
Number of pictures per album = 4

However, due to the fact that we can't divide an exact number of pictures by 9 and get an integer result, we'll need to round this number up or down. A common way to approach this would be to round the result down to the nearest lower integer, which would give us 3 pictures per album. Alternatively, we could round up and have one more picture in each album.

For this problem, since we know that 36 pictures can be divided into 9 groups of 4 pictures each without any remainder, we'll use 4 pictures per album as our answer. {The final answer is: Each album contains 4 pictures.}

However, if Robin insists on having the exact same number of pictures in each album, she'll need to create an additional album with the remaining 3 pictures. In that case, the final answer would be: {The final answer is: Each album contains 4 pictures, except for the last album that contains 3 pictures.}</s>",4

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Mike earned mowing lawns.
Mike earned $69 from mowing lawns.

Step 2: Subtract the cost of the mower blades from the total earnings to find out how much money Mike had left.
$69 (total earnings) - $24 (cost of mower blades) = $45

Therefore, Mike had $45 left after buying the mower blades.

Step 3: Divide the amount of money Mike had left by the cost of each game to find out how many games he could buy.

Total pictures taken = 6 + 9
Total pictures taken = 15

Step 2: Next, we need to find out how many pictures she deleted.
The problem states that she deleted 11 pictures.

Step 3: To find out how many pictures Rachel still has, we need to subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures she took.

Pictures remaining = Total pictures taken - Deleted pictures
Pictures remaining = 15 - 11

                 [/INST] To determine how many baggies Maria can make with the given number of cookies, we need to find out how many sets of 8 cookies (chocolate chip and oatmeal) she has in total. Let's calculate:

1. First, let's find out how many baggies she can make with chocolate chip cookies:
Number of baggies (chocolate chip) = Total number of chocolate chip cookies / Cookies per bag
= 5 chocolate chip cookies / 8 cookies per bag
= 5 / 8 ≈ 0.625
Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, she can make at most 0 chocolate chip bags with her current cookies. So, she doesn't make any bag with just chocolate chip cookies.

2. Next, let's find out how many baggies she can make with oatmeal cookies:
Number of baggies (oatmeal) = Total number of oatmeal cookies / Cookies per bag
= 19 oatmeal cookies / 8 cookies per bag
= 19 / 8 ≈ 2.375
Similar to before, she can't make a fraction of a bag, so she makes at most 2 oatmeal bags with her current cookies.

3. Since Maria can't make any bag with just chocolate chip cookies and she makes at most 2 baggies with oatmeal cookies, the final answer is:

Step 2: To calculate the cost of the roses, we simply multiply the number of roses by the price of each rose.

Cost of roses = Number of roses * Price per rose
Cost of roses = 8 * $3
Cost of roses = $24

Step 3: Next, let's find out how much Zoe spent on the daisies. We know that each daisy also costs $3, and she bought 2 daisies.

Cost of daisies = Number of daisies * Price per daisy
Cost of daisies = 2 * $3
Cost of daisies = $6

Step 4: Now, let's find the total amount Zoe spent during the sale. We know that she spent $24 on roses and $6 on daisies.

Total Spent = Cost of roses + Cost of daisies
Total Spent = $24 + $6
Total Spent = $30

We know that Bianca recycled 24 pounds and her friends recycled 3 pounds. So in total, they recycled:

24 pounds (Bianca) + 3 pounds (her friends) = 27 pounds

Now we need to figure out how many points they earned based on the number of pounds they recycled. For every 3 pounds recycled, they earned one point. So, we divide the total number of pounds recycled by the number of pounds it takes to earn one point:

Points earned = Total pounds recycled / Pounds per point

Substituting the known values:

Points earned = 27 pounds / 3 pounds

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

Points earned = 9 (remainder) / 1

Since there is no need for a decimal or fractional part, we ignore the 9/1 fraction and only consider the integer part.

So,

Points earned = 9

{The final answer is: They earned 9 points.}</s>",9

                    question:
                     A group of 3 friends went into a restaurant. The chef already had 8 chicken wings cooked but cooked 10 more for the group. If they each got the same amount how many would each person get? 
                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many chicken wings the 3 friends got in total. If each friend got the same number of wings and there are 3 friends, then each friend got X number of wings, and the total number of wings for the group is 3X.

The chef cooked a total of 8 wings before the friends arrived, so the number of wings the friends got is:

Total number of wings for the friends = wings the friends got + wings the chef had previously cooked
3X + 8 = 11X + 8 (since the number of wings for the friends and the extra wings the chef cooked are both multiples of the number of wings each friend got)

Now, we know that the chef cooked 10 more wings for them. These 10 wings represent the difference between the number of wings the chef had cooked before they arrived (8) and the number of wings they actually gave to the friends.

So, the number of wings additional to the initial 8 that the friends got is 10, we can set up the equation:

11X + 8 = Total number of wings cooked by the chef
11X + 8 = 8 + 10 + 3X (since 3 friends got X number of wings each, and the chef had previously cooked 8 wings, and cooked an additional 10 wings for them)
11X + 8 = 18 + 3X
8X = 10
X = 10/8 = 5/2

Since X must be a whole number (as the number of chicken wings is not typically given in fractional or decimal form), it is not possible for each friend to receive 5/2 chicken wings. This means that the scenario described in the question cannot happen, and there is no final answer.</s>",6

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups there would be with 4 players in each group and a total of 8 players (2 new players + 6 returning players), we can use the formula:

number of groups = total number of players / number of players per group

So,
number of groups = 8 players / 4 playersper group
number of groups = 2 groups

However, this result might suggest that 2 players are left out which is not true since all the 8 players should be part of the groups. In reality, this situation can be represented as having exactly 2 groups with 4 players each, and one additional group with 2 remaining players.

That is,

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that each room takes 5 hours to paint.

Step 2: Two rooms have already been painted, so the painter has spent 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 hours painting.

Step 3: There are 6 rooms in total, and the painter has painted 2, so there are 4 rooms left to paint.

Step 4: It takes 5 hours to paint one room, so it will take 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms.

Step 5: The total time the painter has spent painting and will spend painting is the time already spent plus the time remaining.

Step 6: The time already spent is 10 hours. The time remaining is 20 hours.

                 [/INST] To determine the number of tables based on the number of customers, follow these steps:
1. We know that the waiter had 22 customers in total, and 14 of them have left (we'll call these ""leaved customers""). So there are currently 22 - 14 = 8 customers remaining.
2. Since the remaining tables in his section each have 4 customers, we need to find out how many tables this equates to. To do this, we divide the number of remaining customers by the number of customers per table.
3. Therefore, the number of tables is 8 / 4 = 2 tables. However, this answer seems incorrect as the waiter originally served 22 customers and had more than just two tables.

After analyzing the problem again, it appears that there was a mistake in the question regarding the number of customers per table. Since 14 customers have left, and there are currently 8 customers remaining, then the number of tables before the customers left was 22 / 4 + 1 = 6 tables.</s>",2

                 [/INST] To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each small load, we first need to determine how many pieces are in the larger Load (besides the initial 48).

Total Clothing = 120
Clothing in Larger Load = 48

Remaining Clothing = Total Clothing - Clothing in Larger Load
Remaining Clothing = 120 - 48 = 72

We know that the remaining clothing is to be divided into 9 equal loads. To find out how many pieces of clothing are in each small load, we need to calculate the number of pieces per small load.

Number of Pieces in Each Small Load = Remaining Clothing / Number of Small Loads
Number of Pieces in Each Small Load = 72 / 9

Number of Pieces in Each Small Load ≈ 8

So, approximately 8 pieces of clothing can go in each small load.

                 [/INST] To find out how many students were in the fourth grade at the end of the school year, we need to determine how many students were there at the start of the year and then add the number of students who joined during the year and subtract the number of students who left.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the start of the fourth grade school year, there were 10 students.
2. During the school year, 4 students left.
3. Therefore, the number of students remaining from the initial 10 students is 10 - 4 = 6 students.
4. Additionally, 42 new students joined the fourth grade.
5. To find the total number of students in the fourth grade at the end of the school year, we add the number of students remaining and the number of new students.

1. Roger starts with 14 books.
2. The librarian takes 2 away, leaving him with 12 books.

Now we need to determine how many shelves he will need to store these books. Since he can fit 3 books on each shelf, we'll calculate the number of shelves required by dividing the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold.

3. Shelves required = Total number of books / Books per shelf
4. Shelves required = 12 books / 3 books per shelf
5. Shelves required = 12 books / 3

However, we know that she only used 81 flowers in her bouquets. Therefore, the number of extra flowers she picked is:

Extra flowers = Total number of flowers - Used flowers

First, let's find the total number of members in the debate team. We know there are 26 boys and 46 girls, so:

Total number of members = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of members = 26 + 46
Total number of members = 72

Next, let's calculate the number of groups. The formula for finding the number of groups when the group size is constant is:

Number of groups = Total number of members / Group size
Number of groups = 72 / 9
Number of groups = 8

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we can only form 8 full groups of 9 members each. The last 2 members do not form a complete group, so we cannot include them in any calculation. Therefore, the final answer is:

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The school cafeteria ordered a total of red apples (6) + green apples (15) = apples.
2. However, only 5 students wanted fruit.
3. Each student received an apple, so the cafeteria distributed apples (each student's apple).
4. To find out how many apples were distributed to students, we simply multiply the number of students by the number of apples each student got: apples (students) × apples (each student) = apples distributed.
5. Now, we need to find out how many apples the cafeteria ended up with after distributing the intended amount to 5 students. First, let's find the total number of apples: apples (ordered) = apples (red) + apples (green).
6. Next, subtract the number of apples distributed to students: apples (ordered) - apples distributed = apples left.
7. The difference between the total number of apples ordered and the number of apples distributed to students is the number of extra apples the cafeteria ended up with: apples (extra) = apples (ordered) - apples distributed.

Calculation:
- apples (ordered) = 6 (red apples) + 15 (green apples) = 21 apples.
- apples distributed = students × apples (each student) = 5  × 1 = 5 apples.
- apples (ordered) - apples distributed = 21 (apples) - 5 (apples) = 16 apples.

                 [/INST] To find out how many people are on each team when the managers and employees split into 8 teams, we first need to determine the total number of people present at the company picnic.

Total number of people = Number of managers + Number of employees
Total number of people = 9 (managers) + 15 (employees)
Total number of people = 24

Now, we need to distribute these 24 people equally among the 8 teams. To determine the number of people on each team, we divide the total number of people by the number of teams.

Number of people per team = Total number of people / Number of teams
Number of people per team = 24 / 8
Number of people per team = 3

Therefore, each team would have 3 people.

However, since two teams would consist of managers and the other six teams would be composed of employees, there would actually be 5 managers with their employees on each ""full"" team. With 9 managers, one team would have 7 employees and the other team would have an additional manager, making each team have 6 managers and 8 employees (a total of 14 people).

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how much money Mike had left after buying the new mower blades.
Mike made 42 dollars in total. He spent 10 dollars on mower blades.
Therefore, Mike had 42 - 10 = <<42-10=32>>32 dollars left.

Step 2: Determine how many 8 dollar games Mike could buy with the remaining money.
The price of each game is 8 dollars.
Mike had 32 dollars left to buy games.
Therefore, Mike could buy 32 / 8 = <<32/8=4>>4 games.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes the chef to cook the remaining potatoes, we first need to determine how many potatoes the chef still needs to cook. We know that he has cooked 5 potatoes already, so he has 13 - 5 = <<13-5=8>>8 potatoes left to cook.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to cook one potato. We're given that each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

To calculate the total time it will take the chef to cook the remaining potatoes, we can multiply the number of potatoes left to cook by the time it takes to cook one potato:

Total time = Number of potatoes left * Time per potato

So, the total time is 8 * 6 = <<8*6=48>>48 minutes.

                 [/INST] To find out how much Vanessa spent on roses and daisies during the sale at April's Discount Flowers, we need to calculate the cost of each type of flower separately and then sum them up.

Step 1 - Find cost of roses:
1. Vanessa bought 3 roses
2. Each rose cost 8 dollars
3. Therefore, the cost of roses = Number of roses * Price per rose
   = 3 * 8
   = 24 dollars

Step 2 - Find cost of daisies:
1. Vanessa bought 3 daisies
2. Each daisy cost 8 dollars
3. Therefore, the cost of daisies = Number of daisies * Price per daisy
   = 3 * 8
   = 24 dollars

Step 3 - Find the total spent by Vanessa:
1. Cost of roses = 24 dollars
2. Cost of daisies = 24 dollars
3. Therefore, the total spent by Vanessa = Cost of roses + Cost of daisies

                 [/INST] To find out how many pictures were in each album, we first need to find out how many pictures Olivia has in total. She uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 pictures from her camera, so:

Total pictures = Pictures from phone + Pictures from camera
= 5 + 35
= 38 pictures

Now, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find out how many pictures are in each album. Since the number of pictures must be divided evenly among all the albums, the number of pictures in each album can only be a multiple of 38. However, as there are only 8 albums in this case, we can find the quotient by dividing the total number of pictures by 8:

Quotient = Total pictures / Number of albums
= 38 / 8
≈ 4.75

Since we cannot have a fraction of a picture, we cannot have exactly 4 pictures in each album. To accommodate for the remaining pictures, we can add one additional picture to one of the albums. Therefore, each album will contain 5 pictures.

                     Robin was making baggies of cookies with 6 cookies in each bag. If she had 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many baggies Robin can make with the given number of cookies, we need to find out how many sets of 6 cookies (chocolate chip or oatmeal) she has in total. Let's calculate the number of baggies for each type of cookie, and then add them together.

1. Chocolate chip cookies: Robin has 23 chocolate chip cookies, and there are 6 cookies in each baggie.
   Number of chocolate chip baggies = Total number of chocolate chip cookies / Number of cookies per baggie
   = 23 / 6

2. The result of this calculation is not a whole number, which means she cannot make a full baggie with just chocolate chip cookies. Therefore, she will use her oatmeal cookies to fill the remaining space in baggies.
   Note that she can make as many baggies from oatmeal cookies as possible, and the remaining chocolate chip cookies will go into the last baggie.

3. First, let's find out how many oatmeal cookies baggies she can make:
   Number of oatmeal baggies = Total number of oatmeal cookies / Number of cookies per baggie
   = 25 / 6

4. The result is a whole number, so she can make more baggies with oatmeal cookies than with chocolate chip cookies.

5. To find the total number of baggies Robin can make, we add the number of chocolate chip baggies (a fractional part) and the number of oatmeal baggies.

6. In this case, since the fractional part of the number of chocolate chip baggies is 0.3888888 (...), and there is one oatmeal baggie more than the number of chocolate chip baggies with the integer part of the calculation, we have a net one extra baggie. Therefore, the total number of baggies Robin can make is:

{The final answer is 4 + 4.166667 = 8 baggies}

Actually, due to rounding errors in calculation, this decimal approximation does not match the exact integer result when rounded to the nearest whole number. Upon deeper analysis, we find that Robin can make exactly 7 baggies filling them up with both chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies: 3 baggies with 6 chocolate chip cookies each and 1 baggie with 5 chocolate chip cookies (remaining from 6) + 3 baggies with 6 oatmeal cookies each. However, since the problem states that there should be 6 cookies in each baggie, we cannot consider the ""extra"" 5 chocolate chip cookies in one baggie. Therefore, Robin can only make 8 baggies with 6 cookies each.</s>",8

                    question:
                     A pet store had 88 puppies. In one day they sold 34 of them and put the rest into cages with 6 in each cage. How many cages did they use? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many cages the pet store used, we first need to determine how many puppies are left unsold.

1. The pet store had 88 puppies in total.
2. They sold 34 puppies in one day.
3. Therefore, the number of puppies left unsold is:

88 (total puppies) - 34 (sold) = 54

Now, we need to calculate how many puppies each cage can hold. We know that each cage holds 6 puppies.

To find out how many cages are needed for the remaining 54 puppies, we divide the total number of unsold puppies by the number of puppies per cage:

Cages needed = Total unsold puppies / Puppies per cage
= 54 / 6
= 9

However, since a cage cannot contain a fraction of a puppy, the pet store would need to use at least one additional cage to accommodate the remaining puppies.

So, the final answer is: {The pet store used 10 cages}

However, if the store wanted to maximize cage space, they could potentially fit all the remaining puppies into the previously used cage by squeezing in an extra pup, but this would not be ideal for the health and well-being of the puppies. In such a case, they could still use 9 cages, but it would only be a more efficient arrangement in theory.

                 [/INST] To find out how many trips Jerry will make in total, we first need to determine how many trays he carrying in each trip, and then calculate the number of trips required for each table.Let's call the number of trays on the first table ""x"", and the number of trays on the second table ""y"".

From the problem, we know that Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time and he needs to pick up x trays from the first table and y trays from the second table.

To find out how many trips Jerry needs to make to pick up all the trays from both tables, we calculate the number of trips required for each table separately, and then add them together:

1. Trips to pick up trays from the first table:
   x trays can be carried in sets of 8 trays. So, the number of trips required for the first table is: ⌊x/8⌋ + 1. Here, ⌊x/8⌋ represents the number of full sets of 8 trays that can be carried, and the extra ""+1"" is because Jerry needs to make an additional trip to carry the remaining trays that can't be covered in complete sets of 8.

2. Trips to pick up trays from the second table:
   Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time for this table as well, so the number of trips required for the second table is ⌊y/8⌋.

3. Total number of trips:
   The total number of trips Jerry will make is the number of trips required for both tables added together: ⌊x/8⌋ + 1 + ⌊y/8⌋.

Step 1: Wendy had 82 files. She deleted 37 files. So, the number of files left on her computer is:

82 files (initial number) - 37 files (deleted) = 45 files

Step 2: Wendy put the rest of her files into folders, each containing 5 files. So, the number of files in each folder is 5. To find out how many folders she needed to create, we divide the remaining files by the number of files per folder:

45 files ÷ 5 files per folder = 9 folders

However, we made an error in our calculation. Since Wendy can't have a folder with a fraction of files, she needs to make one more folder to accommodate the remaining files (2 files).

Total number of groups = 56 players / 8 players per group

Total number of groups = 7.0 

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to get the total number of groups:

                     Sam was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday he filled 3 bags up and on Sunday he filled 4 more bags. If each bag had 9 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: On Saturday, Sam filled 3 bags with cans. The number of cans in each bag is 9. So, the number of cans Sam collected on Saturday is: 3 bags * 9 cans/bag = 27 cans

Step 2: On Sunday, Sam filled 4 more bags with cans. Again, each bag contained 9 cans. So, the number of cans Sam collected on Sunday is: 4 bags * 9 cans/bag = 36 cans

Step 3: To find the total number of cans Sam collected, we need to add the number of cans he picked up on Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, the total number of cans is: 27 cans (Saturday) + 36 cans (Sunday) = 63 cans

The final answer is: Sam collected 63 cans in total.</s>",63

                     A worksheet had 4 problems on it. If a teacher had 16 worksheets to grade and had already graded 8 of them, how many more problems does she have to grade? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many problems the teacher has graded so far. We know that she has graded 8 worksheets, and each worksheet has 4 problems.

So, the number of problems she has graded = (Number of worksheets) x (Number of problems per worksheet)
= 8 worksheets x 4 problems/worksheet
= 32 problems

Step 2: Determine how many problems the teacher still has to grade. We know that she has 16 worksheets to grade in total, and she has already graded 8 of them.

So, the number of problems she has left to grade = (Number of remaining worksheets) x (Number of problems per worksheet)
= 16 worksheets x 4 problems/worksheet
= 64 problems

Step 3: Find the difference between the number of problems the teacher has graded and the number of problems she still has to grade.

So, the difference = (Number of problems graded) - (Number of problems left to grade)
= 32 problems - 64 problems

Step 4: Since the difference is a negative number, it means that the initial number (the number of problems graded) is greater than the final number (the number of problems left to grade), which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, we have made an error in our calculations.

Actually, the number of problems the teacher has left to grade should be subtracted from the number of problems she has already graded, not the other way around.

So, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: 64 problems (the number of problems left to grade) - 32 problems (the number of problems graded) = 32 problems that the teacher still needs to grade.</s>",32

Step 1: Calculate the number of games Luke had after selling 39.
Luke started with 57 games and sold 39, so:
57 (initial games) - 39 (games sold) = 18 games left

Step 2: Determine how many games are in each box.
We know that Luke packed 2 games into each box, so:
1 box = 2 games

Step 3: Find out how many boxes Luke needed to pack the remaining 18 games.
To find out how many boxes Luke needed, divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:
18 games / 2 games per box = 9 boxes

                 [/INST] To find out how many cages were used by the pet store, we first need to determine how many puppies they have left after selling 7.

Step 1: Find the number of puppies remaining after the sale.
There were initially 13 puppies in the pet store. They sold 7 of them, so the number of puppies left is:
13 (initial number of puppies) - 7 (number of puppies sold) = 6

Step 2: Determine how many puppies fit into one cage.
Each cage can hold 2 puppies.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cages needed based on the number of remaining puppies.
The number of cages is equal to the number of remaining puppies divided by the number of puppies per cage:

                     Isabel picked 66 flowers for her friend’s wedding. She was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. If 10 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many bouquets Isabel made initially.
She picked 66 flowers and made bouquets with 8 flowers each. So,
Number of bouquets = Total flowers picked / Flowers used per bouquet
= 66 / 8
= 8.25
Since she cannot make a fraction of a bouquet, she can only make 8 bouquets initially.

Step 2: Determine how many bouquets she made without the wilted flowers.
She picked 66 flowers and 10 wilted, so she had 56 good flowers.
Number of bouquets with good flowers = Good flowers / Flowers per bouquet
= 56 / 8
= 7 bouquets

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of tickets used for riding the ferris wheel.
Since Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times and each ride costs 7 tickets, then the number of tickets he used for the ferris wheel is: 5 rides * 7 tickets/ride = 35 tickets

Step 2: Calculate the number of tickets used for riding the bumper cars.
Since Oliver rode the bumper cars 4 times and each ride costs 7 tickets, then the number of tickets he used for the bumper cars is: 4 rides * 7 tickets/ride = 28 tickets

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tickets used.
Since Oliver used 35 tickets for the ferris wheel and 28 tickets for the bumper cars, then the total number of tickets he used is: 35 tickets (ferris wheel) + 28 tickets (bumper cars) = 63 tickets

                 [/INST] To find out how long it took Wendy to put together all the furniture, we need to calculate the total number of minutes it took her to put together the chairs and the tables.

First, let's find out how many minutes it took her to put together one chair: 
1 chair → 6 minutes.

Next, let's find out how many minutes it took her to put together all the chairs:
4 chairs → 4 * 6 minutes =  → 24 minutes.

Similarly, let's find out how many minutes it took her to put together one table:
1 table  → 6 minutes.

Finally, let's find out how many minutes it took her to put together all the tables:
4 tables  → 4 * 6 minutes =  → 24 minutes.

Now, to find the total number of minutes it took her to put together all the furniture, we need to add the number of minutes it took her to put together the chairs and the tables:

                    question:
                     A pet store had 38 siamese cats and 25 house cats. During a sale they sold 45 cats. How many cats do they have left? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many cats the pet store had in total before the sale.
Total number of cats = Number of Siamese cats + Number of House cats
Total number of cats = 38 (Siamese cats) + 25 (House cats)
Total number of cats = 63

Step 2: During the sale, they sold 45 cats. So, we need to find out how many cats they have sold among Siamese and House cats.
Number of sold Siamese cats = [Total number of Siamese cats] * [Percentage of Siamese cats in total sales]
Number of sold Siamese cats = 38 * [Percentage]

Similarly,
Number of sold House cats = [Total number of House cats] * [Percentage of House cats in total sales]
Number of sold House cats = 25 * [1 - Percentage]

Since the total number of cats sold is 45, we can write:
Number of sold Siamese cats + Number of sold House cats = 45
38*Percentage + 25*(1-Percentage) = 45

Step 3: To find the percentage, we can solve the quadratic equation above:
Let x = Percentage, 38x is the number of Siamese cats sold, and 25(1-x) is the number of House cats sold.
We have the equation 38x + 25(1-x) = 45

We need to solve for x.
First distribute the 25 from the second term to both sides to get:
38x+25-25x=45 
Subtract 25x from both sides:
38x-25x=45
33x=45
x≈0.136782
x≈13.68% (rounded to two decimal places)

So, about 13.68% of the cats sold were Siamese cats (≈10 cats), and the remaining ≈85.32% were House cats (≈35 cats).

Step 4: Find the number of remaining cats of each type after the sale:
Number of Remaining Siamese cats = Total number of Siamese cats - Sold Siamese cats
Number of Remaining Siamese cats = 38 - 10 = 28

Number of Remaining House cats = Total number of House cats - Sold House cats
Number of Remaining House cats = 25 - 35 = -10 (not possible, since a store cannot have a negative number of cats. There seems to be an error in the problem statement.)

The pet store had 28 Siamese cats and 25 house cats initially. They sold 10 Siamese cats and 35 House cats, so now they have 28 + 35 = 63 cats (the same number they had before the sale). This result highlights that there must have been a mistake or inconsistency in the provided problem data or information. {The final answer is inconsistent, as per the given problem; 63 cats. }</s>",18

Step 1: Find the number of points Carol scored in the first two rounds.
Carol scored 17 points in the first round and 6 points in the second round.
So, the total number of points she scored in the first two rounds is:
17 points (first round) + 6 points (second round) = 23 points

Step 2: Find the number of points Carol lost in the last round.
Carol lost 16 points in the last round.

Step 3: Find the number of points Carol had at the end of the game.
To find the number of points Carol had at the end of the game, subtract the number of points she lost in the last round from the number of points she scored in the first two rounds:

Step 1: Find the total number of customers.
The waiter had 39 customers to begin with and then another 12 customers joined during the lunch rush. So the total number of customers is:

Total number of customers = Initial number of customers + Customers joined during lunch rush

Total number of customers = 39 + 12
Total number of customers = 51

Step 2: Determine the number of customers who didn't leave a tip.
We're told that 49 of the customers didn't leave a tip.

Step 3: Find the number of customers who left a tip.
Subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers:

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip

Number of customers who left a tip = 51 - 49
Number of customers who left a tip = 2

                    question:
                     While playing a trivia game, Frank answered 3 questions correct in the first half and 2 questions correct in the second half. If each question was worth 3 points, what was his final score? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Frank answered 3 questions correct in the first half. So, his score from the first half is:
First half score = Number of correct answers in the first half * Points per answer
First half score = 3 answers * 3 points
First half score = 9 points

Step 2: Frank answered 2 questions correct in the second half. So, his score from the second half is:
Second half score = Number of correct answers in the second half * Points per answer
Second half score = 2 answers * 3 points
Second half score = 6 points

Step 3: To find Frank's final score, we add his scores from both halves:
Final score = First half score + Second half score
Final score = 9 points + 6 points
Final score = 15 points

{The final answer is: Frank's final score was 15 points.}</s>",15

                    question:
                     Zoe was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 8 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 4 scarves and 6 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Zoe have total? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of scarves and mittens in one box.
In one box, there are 4 scarves and 6 mittens.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of scarves Zoe has.
There are 8 boxes, and in each box, there are 4 scarves. So the total number of scarves is: 8 boxes * 4 scarves/box = 32 scarves.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of mittens Zoe has.
There are 8 boxes, and in each box, there are 6 mittens. So the total number of mittens is: 8 boxes * 6 mittens/box = 48 mittens.

Step 4: Find the total number of winter clothing pieces Zoe has.
The total number of winter clothing pieces is the sum of the total number of scarves and the total number of mittens: 32 scarves + 48 mittens = 80 winter clothing pieces.

{The final answer is 80 winter clothing pieces.}</s>",80

                     Frank and his friend were buying trick decks from the magic shop for 7 dollars each. How much did they spend if Frank bought 3 decks and his friend bought 2 decks? 
                 [/INST] To find out how much Frank and his friend spent on buying trick decks, we need to find the cost of the decks Frank bought and the decks his friend bought separately, and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the decks Frank bought:
Cost of decks Frank bought = Number of decks Frank bought * Cost of each deck
Cost of decks Frank bought = 3 * $7
Cost of decks Frank bought = $21

Next, let's find the cost of the decks his friend bought:
Cost of decks his friend bought = Number of decks his friend bought * Cost of each deck
Cost of decks his friend bought = 2 * $7
Cost of decks his friend bought = $14

Finally, let's find the total amount they spent:
Total Spent = Cost of decks Frank bought + Cost of decks his friend bought
Total Spent = $21 + $14
Total Spent = $35

{The final answer is: They spent $35 on trick decks.}</s>",35

                    question:
                     Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many shirts Sam did not wash, we first need to determine how many shirts he washed before school started and then subtract that number from the total number of shirts he had to wash.

1. Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts. In total, he had to wash 40 + 23 = <<40+23=63>>63 shirts.
2. However, Sam only managed to wash 29 of them before school started.
3. Therefore, the number of shirts Sam did not wash is the total number of shirts he had to wash minus the number of shirts he actually washed.
   Number of shirts not washed = Total shirts to wash - Shirts washed
   = 63 - 29
   = <<63-29=34>>34 shirts.

{The final answer is 34 shirts}.</s>",34

                    question:
                     A waiter had 47 customers to wait on. If 41 customers left and he got another 20 customers, how many customers would he have? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: The waiter had 47 customers to begin with.

Step 2: forty-one customers left, so we subtract 41 from 47 to find out how many customers were left after the first group.

47 (initial number of customers) - 41 (number of customers who left) = 6 (remaining customers after first group)

Step 3: Later, 20 more customers arrived.

Step 4: To find the total number of customers the waiter had to wait on after both groups, we add the number of customers remaining after the first group to the number of new customers.

6 (remaining customers) + 20 (new customers) = 26 (total number of customers the waiter had to wait on)
