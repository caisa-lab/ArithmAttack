                    question:
                     Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player initially.
Step 2: She deleted 9 old songs from it. This means the number of songs on her mp3 player after deleting the old songs is:

Initial number of songs = 11
Number of songs deleted = 9

Final number of songs after deletion = Initial number of songs - Number of songs deleted
Final number of songs after deletion = 11 - 9
Final number of songs after deletion = 2

Step 3: Then she added 8 new songs to her mp3 player. This means the final number of songs on her mp3 player is:

Number of songs after deletion = 2
Number of new songs added = 8

Final number of songs on the mp3 player = Number of songs after deletion + Number of new songs added
Final number of songs on the mp3 player = 2 +8
Final number of songs on the mp3 player = 10

{The final answer is: Paige has 10 songs on her mp3 player.}</s>",10
" There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut? ","<s> [INST]

                    question:
                     There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we first need to determine how many students were called back. We know that there were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out, and 26 of them were called back.

1. The number of students called back is the sum of the number of girls and the number of boys called back:
   Called back girls = Total girls - Students not called back girls
   Called back boys = Total boys - Students not called back boys
2. We are given that there were 26 students called back in total. So we can set up the following equation:
   Called back girls + Called back boys = 26
3. We also know that there were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out in total:
   Total students = Girls + Boys
4. To find the number of students not called back, we need to first find the number of students called back for each gender. Since the number of students not called back for each gender will have the same value, we can find this value by subtracting the number of students called back from the total number of students for that gender.
5. For girls:
   Called back girls = Total girls - Students not called back girls
   Called back girls = 39 - Students not called back girls
6. Using the total number of students called back (26), we can set up the following equation:
   (39 - Students not called back girls) + Called back boys = 26
7. Since we know that there were only 4 boys trying out, we can substitute that value in for Called back boys:
   (39 - Students not called back girls) + 4 = 26
8. Solving this equation, we find that Students not called back girls = 15.

Therefore, {The final answer is 15 students didn't make the cut for the basketball team (11 girls and 4 boys)}.</s>",17

                 [/INST] Step 1: Faye started with 34 coloring books.

Step 2: She gave away 3 coloring books, so she had 34 - 3 = 31 coloring books left.

Step 3: She bought 48 more coloring books.

Step 4: To find the total number of coloring books Faye has, add the number of coloring books she had left after giving some away to the number of coloring books she bought: 31 (left) + 48 (bought) = <u>79</u>

                     The school cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch for the students and then bought 6 more, how many apples would they have? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: The school cafeteria started with 23 apples.

Step 2: They used 20 apples to make lunches for the students.
So, the number of apples left = Starting number of apples (23) - Apples used (20)

Step 3: After making lunches, they bought an additional 6 apples.
So, the new total number of apples = Previous number of apples (from step 2) + Apples bought (6)

Step 4: Let's calculate each step.

Step 1: They started with 23 apples.

Step 2: They used 20 apples, so there were 23 - 20 = 3 apples left.

Step 3: They bought an additional 6 apples.

Step 4: So, the current number of apples is 3 (from step 2) + 6 (from step 3) = 9 apples.

                    question:
                     In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 9 points. If a level has 11 enemies total and you destroy all but 3 of them, how many points would you earn? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the points earned for defeating all enemies in the level.
Points per enemy = 9
Number of enemies in the level = 11
Points earned for defeating all enemies = Points per enemy * Number of enemies
Points earned for defeating all enemies = 9 * 11
Points earned for defeating all enemies = 99

Step 2: Calculate the points earned for defeating the enemies that were not destroyed.
Number of enemies destroyed = 8
Number of enemies not destroyed = 3
Points earned for defeating enemies not destroyed = Points per enemy * Number of enemies not destroyed
Points earned for defeating enemies not destroyed = 9 * 3
Points earned for defeating enemies not destroyed = 27

Step 3: Calculate the total points earned.
Total points earned = Points earned for defeating all enemies + Points earned for defeating enemies not destroyed
Total points earned = 99 + 27
Total points earned = 126

                 [/INST] Step 1: Megan earns 8 points for each bag of cans she recycles.

Step 2: Megan had 14 bags of cans but didn't recycle 5 of them. So, the number of bags she actually recycled is 14 - 5 = 9 bags.

Step 3: Since Megan earns 8 points for each bag, the number of points she earned by recycling is 9 bags * 8 points/bag = 72 points.

                    question:
                     April's discount flowers was having a sale where each rose was 4 dollars. If April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left, how much money did she earn? 
                 [/INST] To find out how much money April earned during the sale, we need to find out how much she spent on roses and then subtract that amount from the total amount of money she received.

1. The cost of each rose was $4.
2. April started with 13 roses and bought 4 more roses. So she bought a total of 13 + 4 = <<13+4=17>>17 roses.
3. Therefore, the total amount she spent on roses was $17 * $4/rose = $<<17*4=68>>68.
4. Since we want to find out how much money she earned, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the total amount she received. However, the problem does not provide information about how many roses April sold or the price at which she sold them.
5. Without this information, it is impossible to calculate how much money April earned.

                    question:
                     Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? 
                 [/INST] To determine how many shirts Ned did not wash, we first need to find out how many shirts he washed and how many he had in total.

1. Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts. In total, he had to wash:
Short sleeve shirts = 9
Long sleeve shirts = 21
Total shirts = 9 + 21 =  <INS>20 shirts</INS> (for the short sleeves and long sleeves)

2. Ned washed 29 shirts before school started. So, the number of shirts he did not wash is:
Shirts not washed = Total shirts - Shirts washed
Shirts not washed = 20 shirts - 29
Shirts not washed = -9

However, the negative answer does not make sense in this context since the number of shirts cannot be negative. This result suggests that an error must have occurred in the problem statement, and Ned could not have washed fewer shirts than he had. Therefore, the answer as given in the problem cannot be correct. {The final answer is: The information provided is inconsistent and the answer cannot be determined.}</s>",1

                    question:
                     A company invited 47 people to a luncheon, but 7 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 5 people each, how many tables do they need? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of people who attended the luncheon.
People who attended = Total invited - People who didn't show up
People who attended = 47 - 7
People who attended = 40

Step 2: Determine the number of tables needed by finding out how many people one table can accommodate.
People per table = 5

Step 3: Calculate the number of tables needed.
Number of tables = People who attended / People per table
Number of tables = 40 / 5

Step 4: Simplify the fraction obtained in Step 3.
Number of tables = 8

However, due to practical considerations, it's unlikely that they would rent an exact number of tables. To account for this, they may want to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that they have enough seating. Therefore, they would need at least 9 tables.

{The final answer is: they need at least 9 tables.}</s>",8
" Tom had 5 books. If he sold 4 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Tom have? ","<s> [INST]

                     Tom had 5 books. If he sold 4 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Tom have? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Tom started with 5 books.

Step 2: Tom sold 4 books, so he had 5 - 4 = <b>1</b> book left after selling.

Step 3: Tom used the money he earned from selling 4 books to buy 38 new books. To find the total amount of money Tom earned from selling 4 books, we need to know how much each book sold for. Let's assume each book sold for x dollars. So, Tom earned 4 * x dollars.

Step 4: Tom used this money to buy 38 new books. Let's find the cost of one new book and the total cost of buying 38 new books. The cost of one new book is x dollars, and the total cost of buying 38 new books is 38 * x dollars.

Step 5: Since Tom used all the money he earned from selling his old books to buy the new books, the total cost of his old books plus the total cost of his new books must be equal: 4 * x = 38 * x

Step 6: Solving the equation, we find that x = 1. This means that each old book sold for 1 dollar and each new book cost 1 dollar.

Step 7: Now, let's find out how many new books Tom bought with the money from selling one old book: 1 dollar from selling one old book = 1 new book; Tom sold 4 old books = 4 new books. Tom started with 1 old book left, so he had 1 old book + 4 new books = <b>5</b> books in total.

                     For a birthday party Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 9 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up? 
                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many sodas Jerry bought in total: 41 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 63 sodas.

Next, we need to find out how many sodas can be stored on each shelf. So, there are 9 regular sodas or diet sodas that can be stored on each shelf.

To find out how many shelves Jerry needs to fill up completely, we'll divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can be stored on each shelf: 63 sodas / 9 sodas per shelf = 7 shelves with 1 sodas left over.

Since Jerry can't have a half shelf, he'll need to fill up 7 full shelves. {The final answer is 7 shelves.}</s>",7

Total candy = Debby's candy + Sister's candy
Total candy = 32 + 42
Total candy = 74

                 [/INST] Step 1: Emily started with 41 seeds in total.
Step 2: She planted 29 seeds in the big gardens. Thus, the number of seeds left in the gardens is: 41 (total seeds) - 29 (seeds in big gardens) = 12 seeds.
Step 3: Emily put 4 seeds in each small garden. So, the number of small gardens she has is the total number of seeds remaining divided by the number of seeds per small garden: 12 (total seeds left) / 4 (seeds per small garden) = 3 gardens.

Therefore, the final answer is: {Emily had 3 small gardens}.</s>",3

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the total number of candies Emily has.
Emily received 5 pieces from neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister. So, the total number of candies Emily has is: 5 (pieces from neighbors) + 13 (pieces from older sister) = <em>18 pieces</em>

Step 2: Determine how many days the candies would last her if she eats 9 pieces a day.
To find out how many days the candies would last her, divide the total number of candies by the number of candies she eats a day: 18 (total candies) / 9 (candies per day) = ≈<strong>2</strong>. However, since she can't have a fraction of a day, she can only last 2 full days with 9 pieces a day.

So, to find out the actual number of days she can last with her candies, we need to check if she can finish the remaining candies after the 2 days. She has 9 pieces left after the first day, and she eats 9 pieces a day, so she can finish those. Therefore, the total number of days she can last with her candies is: 2 (full days) + 1 (day with the remaining candies) = <em>{The final answer is: 3 days}</em>.</s>",2

                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Mike will need, we first need to determine how many books he is left with after the librarian takes 10 books.

1. We know there were originally 82 books and 10 were taken, so Mike is left with:

Mike's books = Original number of books - Books taken
={82} - {10}
={72}

2. Next, we need to figure out how many books can be put on one shelf. Mike can fit 9 books on one shelf, so the number of books per shelf is:

Books per shelf = Number of books Mike can fit on one shelf
={9}

3. To find out how many shelves Mike will need, we divide the number of books he has left by the number of books that can be put on one shelf:

Number of shelves = Mike's books / Books per shelf
={72} / {9}

1. We know that the builder has already installed 8 windows, so we need to find out how many windows are still left to be installed.
2. The total number of windows needed is 14.
3. Therefore, the number of windows that have not been installed yet is: 14 (total windows) - 8 (windows already installed) = 6

4. We also know that it takes 8 hours to install each window.
5. So, to find the time it takes to install the remaining windows, we need to multiply the number of windows left by the time it takes to install one window: 6 (windows) x 8 (hours per window)

We know that 5 customers didn't leave a tip, so that means there must have been 7 - 5 = <b>2</b> customers who did leave a tip.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of tip money received.
We know that each tip was $3, and there were 2 customers who left a tip. So, we can find the total tip money by multiplying the number of tipping customers by the tip amount: 2 * $3 = $<b>6</b>.

Step 3: Find the total money earned.
We have determined that the waiter earned $6 in tips. However, the question doesn't ask for just the tip money; it asks for the total money earned. We don't have any information about how much the customers paid for their meals (which could potentially have been included in the $6 tip money), so we don't know the exact total amount earned. Therefore, the question as asked cannot be answered definitively.

However, if we assume that the $6 represents the total amount earned (including both tips and meal costs), then the final answer is:

{The final answer is: $<b>6</b>.}

But if we want to be more precise and find the exact amount earned only from the tips, the final answer would be:

{The final answer is: $<b>6</b> (from tips).}</s>",6

Step 2: Divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of people to find out how many wings each person got.

There are 4 people in the group, so each person gets:

16 (total chicken wings) / 4 (number of people) = 4 chicken wings each.

1. The pet shelter had 5 puppies initially.
2. Another 35 puppies were brought in, so the total number of puppies is 5 + 35 = <<5+35=30>>30 puppies.
3. 8 puppies are adopted each day.

To find the number of days it takes for all the puppies to be adopted, we divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.

The final answer is: {It would take 30 puppies / 8 puppies per day = <<30/8=3.75>>3.75 days or approximately 4 days to adopt all the puppies}.

                    question:
                     A pet store had 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats. During a sale they sold 10 cats. How many cats do they have left? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: We start with the total number of cats the pet store had before the sale.
Total number of cats = Siamese cats + House cats
= 13 (siamese cats) + 5 (house cats)
= 18 cats

Step 2: During the sale, they sold 10 cats. So, the number of cats they have now is the total number of cats minus the number of cats sold.

Number of cats after sale = Total number of cats - Cats sold
= 18 cats - 10 cats
= 8 cats

Step 3: To find the number of siamese cats and house cats left, we need to know how many of each type were sold. If we assume that an equal number of siamese and house cats were sold in the sale (this is not given in the problem), we can find the number of each type of cat left as follows:

Number of siamese cats left = Number of siamese cats initially - Number of siamese cats sold
= 13 cats - (Number of cats sold / 2)

Number of house cats left = Number of house cats initially - Number of house cats sold
= 5 cats - (Number of cats sold / 2)

If Number of cats sold = 10, then the number of cats of each type left are calculated as follows:
Number of siamese cats left = 13 - (10 / 2) = 11 cats
Number of house cats left = 5 - (10 / 2) = 3 cats

Since the problem does not specify whether an equal number of each type of cat were sold, we cannot make an exact answer. However, with the given information, we can find that they have left with either 11 siamese cats and 3 house cats, or a different distribution based on different sales ratios.

First, let's find out how much Victor made on Monday (5 hours at $6 an hour):
Monday's earnings = Hours worked * Hourly wage
                          = 5 hours * $6/hour
                          = $30

Next, let's find out how much Victor made on Tuesday (also 5 hours at $6 an hour):
Tuesday's earnings = Hours worked * Hourly wage

                    question:
                     Megan baked 71 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 43 of them how many packages could she make if she put 7 cupcake in each package? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many packages Megan can make after her brother Todd ate 43 cupcakes, we first need to determine how many cupcakes Megan has left.

1. Megan baked 71 cupcakes.
2. Todd ate 43 of them, so that leaves:
   71 (total cupcakes) - 43 (cupcakes Todd ate) = 28 cupcakes (left for Megan)

Now we can divide the number of remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per package to find out how many packages Megan can make:

3. Packages Megan can make = 28 (remaining cupcakes) / 7 (cupcakes per package)
    Packages Megan can make = 4.0 ≈ 4 (since Megan cannot have a fraction of a package)

So, even after her brother ate some of her cupcakes, Megan could still make approximately 4 packages to sell at the bake sale.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many bouquets Wendy made with the flowers that didn't wilt.
We know that she picked 103 flowers, and each bouquet has 8 flowers. So,
Number of bouquets made with fresh flowers = Total flowers picked / Flowers per bouquet
= 103 / 8
= 13.125 

Since we can't make a fraction of a bouquet, we'll round this down to 13 bouquets that Wendy made with fresh flowers.

Step 2: Now, we need to find out how many bouquets she could make with the flowers that didn't wilt.
We know that 47 of the flowers wilted, so there were 103 - 47 = 56 fresh flowers.
The number of bouquets she could make with the remaining flowers is:
= Total fresh flowers / Flowers per bouquet
= 56 / 8
= 7 bouquets

Therefore, after 47 wilted, Wendy could still make {7 bouquets}.</s>",7

Number of books Adam had initially = 48
Number of books Adam sold = 19

Step 2: Subtract the number of books Adam sold from the number of books he had initially to find out how many books he has left after selling.
Difference between the initial number of books and the number of books sold = Remaining books
Remaining books = Initial number of books - Number of books sold
Remaining books = 48 - 19
Remaining books = 29

Step 3: Adam used the money he earned from selling the books to buy 38 new books.
Number of new books Adam bought = 38

Step 4: To find the total number of books Adam now has, add the number of books he had remaining after selling to the number of new books he bought.
Total number of books Adam has = Remaining books + New books
Total number of books Adam has = 29 + 38
Total number of books Adam has = 67

                    question:
                     Luke was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 4 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another, how many trips will he make? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many trips Luke makes, we need to determine the number of trips required to pick up all the trays from both tables.

First, let's calculate how many trips it takes to pick up all the trays from one table:

1. Luke can carry 4 trays at a time.
2. There are 20 trays on the first table.
3. The number of trips required to pick up all the trays from one table = Total number of trays on the table ÷ Number of trays Luke can carry per trip

Trips for table 1 = 20 trays ÷ 4 trays/trip = 5 trips

Now, calculate the number of trips required to pick up all the trays from the second table:

1. There are 16 trays on the second table.
2. Trips for table 2 = 16 trays ÷ 4 trays/trip = 4 trips

Finally, add the number of trips required to pick up all the trays from both tables to get the total number of trips Luke makes:

Total trips = Trips for table 1 + Trips for table 2 = 5 trips + 4 trips = 9 trips

                     The cafeteria had 96 apples. For lunch they handed out 42 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 6 apples, how many pies could they make? 
                 [/INST] To determine how many pies the cafeteria could make with the remaining apples, follow these steps:

1. First, let's find out how many apples were given to students: 96 apples -> 42 apples (given to students)
2. Next, we need to find out how many apples are left for making pies: 96 apples (total) -> 42 apples (given to students) -> 54 apples (remaining)
3. Now, let's calculate how many pies could be made using the remaining apples: 54 apples -> Pies = Apples per pie

We know that each pie takes 6 apples. So,

4. To find the number of pies that can be made, divide the remaining apples by the number of apples per pie: 54 apples -> Pies = 54 apples / 6 apples per pie

Using long division, we get:
```
    _ _ _ _ _
9            54

-----------------
    12

```
So, the number of pies that can be made is the quotient, which is 9, plus the remainder carried over from the last column, which is 1. Therefore,

{The final answer is: 10 pies}

Note: There might be a slight discrepancy in the number of apples left after giving 42 to students (96 - 42 = 54), but if each pie takes exactly 6 apples as mentioned, the final answer of 10 pies is correct based on the information provided in the question.</s>",9

Good carrots = Carrots picked by Vanessa + Carrots picked by her mom
Good carrots = 17 + 14
Good carrots = 31

However, the question states that only 24 carrots were good. This means there must be some bad carrots. Let's calculate how many bad carrots there were:

Bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Good carrots
Bad carrots = (Carrots picked by Vanessa + Carrots picked by her mom) - 24
Bad carrots = (17 + 14) - 24

                     There were 5 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: We have 5 friends playing the video game. Each friend has 8 lives.

Step 2: To find the total number of lives for the friends, we multiply the number of friends by the number of lives each friend has.

Total lives of friends = Number of friends * Lives per friend
= 5 * 8
= 40

Step 3: Then, 2 more players joined the game, each having 8 lives also.

Step 4: To find the total number of lives for the new players, we multiply the number of new players by the number of lives each new player has.

Total lives of new players = Number of new players * Lives per new player
= 2 * 8
= 16

Step 5: To find the total number of lives for all players in the game, we add the total lives for the initial friends to the total lives for the new players.

Total lives for all players = Total lives for friends + Total lives for new players
= 40 + 16
= 56

                 [/INST] To find out how many 2-dollar games Frank could buy with the money he had left after buying new mower blades, follow these steps:

Step 1: Find out how much money Frank had left after buying new mower blades.
Frank made 19 dollars mowing lawns. He spent 11 dollars on new mower blades. So, the amount of money Frank had left is:
19 dollars (money made) - 11 dollars (money spent on mower blades) = 8 dollars

Step 2: Find out how many 2-dollar games Frank could buy with the 8 dollars he had left.
Since each game costs 2 dollars, we can calculate how many games Frank could buy by dividing the money he had left by the cost per game:
Number of games = Money left / Cost per game
Number of games = 8 dollars / 2 dollars per game = 4 games

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups there would be with 6 players in each group for a total of 54 players (48 new players + 6 returning players), we can simply divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.

Step 1: Find the total number of players.
total players = new players + returning players
total players = 48 + 6
total players = 54

Step 2: Divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group to find the number of groups.
groups = total players / players per group
groups = 54 / 6

Step 3: Perform the division calculation.
groups ≈ 9 with a remainder of 0

Step 4: Since there can't be a remainder of 0 when dividing into groups of size 6, we must round up.
groups = 10

{The final answer is: There would be 10 groups of 6 players each for a total of 60 players.}

However, note that the actual number of players in the last group would be fewer than 6 due to the round-up. To accommodate for the rounding, you could create an additional smaller group with the remaining players. For example, if the baseball team had 55 players, they could make 9 groups of 6 and one group of 1 player.</s>",9

1. Nancy had 80 files on her computer.
2. She deleted 31 files, leaving her with 80 - 31 = 49 files.
3. Nancy put the rest of the files into folders, each containing 7 files.
4. To find out how many folders she ended up with, we need to divide the number of files in each folder by the number of files per folder:
   Number of folders = (Number of files in each folder) / (Files per folder)
5. We know that there are 7 files in each folder:
   Number of folders = 7 / 1

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many games Luke had left after selling 19 of them:

Initial number of games = 39
Number of games sold = 19

Remaining number of games = Initial number of games - Number of games sold
= 39 - 19
= 20

Now, let's calculate how many games can fit into each box:

Number of games per box = 4

Lastly, let's determine how many boxes Luke would need to pack up the remaining games:

Number of boxes = Remaining number of games / Number of games per box
= 20 / 4

65 (total students) - 17 (students not picked) = 48 students

Since there are 8 groups, we can find out how many students are in each group by dividing the total number of students on the teams by the number of groups:

Students per group = Total students on teams / Number of groups

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Isabel uploaded a total of 25 pictures.
2. She put 10 pictures into one album, so we know that one album contains 10 pictures.
3. The rest of the pictures were distributed among 5 different albums.
4. To find out how many pictures are in each of the remaining 5 albums, we first need to find out how many pictures are in the 4 albums that each have fewer pictures than the largest album (which has 10 pictures).
5. Since there are 5 remaining albums and one of them has 10 pictures, the other 4 albums must together contain the remaining 15 pictures (25 total - 10 in the largest album).
6. The sum of the number of pictures in the 4 smaller albums must equal 15, so the number of pictures in each of the 4 smaller albums is 15 / 4 = 3.75. However, since we can't have a fraction of a picture, we must conclude that this problem cannot be solved with the given information and an error was made in the problem statement by assuming that the smaller albums could each hold a different number of pictures.

                 [/INST] To find out how long Mike's money lasts, we first need to find out how much money he has in total. We know that he made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 26 dollars weed eating, so his total earnings are:

Total earnings = Earnings from mowing lawns + Earnings from weed eating
Total earnings = 14 dollars + 26 dollars
Total earnings = 30 dollars

Next, we need to find out how long his money lasts, given that he spends 5 dollars a week. To do this, we can divide his total earnings by the amount he spends each week:

Weeks until money runs out = Total earnings / Weekly spending
Weeks until money runs out = 30 dollars / 5 dollars per week
Weeks until money runs out = 6 weeks

So, Mike's money will last him for 6 weeks. {The final answer is 6 weeks}.</s>",8

                     Vanessa had 16 music files and 48 video files on her flash drive. If she deleted 30 of the files, how many files were still on her flash drive? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: We are given that Vanessa had 16 music files and 48 video files on her flash drive. So, the total number of files she had was:
16 music files + 48 video files = 62 files

Step 2: Vanessa deleted 30 files. We do not know if these files were all music files, all video files, or a combination of both. For now, let's assume that these files were removed from one category (either music or video) to find a minimum number of files still left on the flash drive.

Step 3: If we assume that Vanessa deleted 30 music files, then the number of music files remaining would be:
16 music files - 30 music files = -14 music files

This result indicates an error or an impossible situation, as the number of files cannot be negative. Therefore, this option is not valid.

Step 4: Now let's assume that Vanessa deleted 30 video files. In this case, the number of video files remaining would be:
48 video files - 30 video files = 18 video files

Step 5: Adding the remaining music files and video files together, we find that:
Total number of files = 16 music files + 18 video files = 34 files

Since our initial calculation of total files included both incorrect and correct files (16 music files and 48 video files), we should subtract the number of deleted files to find the correct number of files remaining on the flash drive:

Step 6: The number of files deleted = 16 music files + 48 video files = 62 files, and 30 files were deleted.

So, the final correct answer is:

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. We know that Will initially wants to split the remaining clothing into 9 equal loads. To find out how many pieces of clothing each small load can contain, we simply need to divide the total number of remaining pieces by the number of small loads.
2. First, let's calculate the number of pieces of clothing that were already washed in the large load: 59 (total pieces) - 32 (in the large load) = 27 pieces.
3. Now we can determine the size of each small load: 27 (remaining pieces) / 9 (small loads) = ≈ 3 pieces per small load.
4. However, since he can't wash a fraction of a piece of clothing, and to ensure that each load is as full as possible, we round up and assume each small load can wash 4 pieces.

                 [/INST] To find out how many new books Victor bought, we first need to determine how many books he brought home after giving away or using some of them.

1. Victor bought 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books in total.
2. He used or gave away 16 books.

3. To find out how many new books he bought, we need to subtract the number of used/given away books from the total number of books he bought.

New Books = Total Books - Used Books
= 32 adventure books + 37 mystery books - 16 used books
= 65 books - 16 books
= 49 books

                 [/INST] Step 1: We start with 4 friends in the game, and each of them has 3 lives. So the total number of lives for the friends is:

      Lives of friends = Number of friends * Lives per friend
                           = 4 * 3
                           = 12 lives

                 [/INST]step 1: We know that Janet bought a total of 6 country albums and 2 pop albums.
step 2: Each country album came with a lyric sheet and had 9 songs, so the number of songs in each country album is 9.
step 3: Each pop album also came with a lyric sheet and had 9 songs, so the number of songs in each pop album is also 9.
step 4: To find the total number of songs that Janet bought, we can multiply the number of country albums by the number of songs in each country album, and then add the number of pop albums multiplied by the number of songs in each pop album.
step 5: So, Janet bought 6 country albums * 9 songs = 54 country songs.

First, let's find out how much money Jerry made in total:
Money made mowing lawns = $14
Money made weed eating = $31
Total money = $14 + $31 = $45

Next, we know that Jerry spends $5 a week. So, to find out how many weeks his money will last him, we can divide the total amount of money by the amount he spends per week:

Weeks = Total money / Weekly spending
Weeks = $45 / $5
Weeks = 9

So, Jerry's money will last him for 9 weeks.

Step 2: Next, we find out how many books Adam sold. He sold 11 books.
Step 3: To find out how many books Adam bought with the money he earned from selling the books, we need to know how much he earned. If we assume that the price of each book was the same for both the old and new books, then we can find out the price of one book by dividing the number of books he sold by the number of books he had initially: Price of one book = Number of books sold / Initial number of books = 11 books / 33 books = 1/3. Since we can't have a fraction of a book, assume the price was rounded to the nearest whole number which is 1. With that in mind, Adam made 11 * $1 = $11.
Step 4: We then use this $11 to find out how many new books he bought: Number of new books = Money earned / Price per new book = $11 / $1 = 11 books.
Step 5: Finally, we add the number of books Adam initially had, the number of books he sold, and the number of books he bought to find out the total number of books he has now: Total number of books = Initial number of books + Number of books sold + Number of new books = 33 books + 11 books + 11 books = 55 books.

1 mystery shelf has 6 books
So, 2 mystery shelves have 2 x 6 = 12 mystery books

Next, let's find out how many books are on each picture shelf:
1 picture shelf has 6 books
So, 6 picture shelves have 6 x 6 = 36 picture books

Now, let's add the number of mystery books and picture books together to find the total number of books Nancy has:

Step 4: Total money = Initial money + Additional money
Total money = 3 dollars + 7 dollars
Total money = 10 dollars

Step 5: The price of one 5 dollar toy is 5 dollars.

Step 6: To find out how many toys Paul can buy, we need to divide the total money by the price of one toy.

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many files Katie had left after deleting 40. We know she started with 85 files and deleted 40, so:

85 files (initial) - 40 files (deleted) = 45 files (remaining)

Now, we know that each folder has 5 files. So, we can find the number of folders by dividing the number of remaining files by the number of files per folder:

number of folders = remainder files / files per folder
= 45 files / 5 files per folder
= 9 folders (with the remainder of 0 files)

However, since it's highly unlikely for Katie to create a folder without filling it up completely, we'll assume that she created folders with exactly 5 files each (ignoring the remaining 0 files from our calculation). To find the total number of folders, we'll simply increase the calculated number of folders by one:

                     Luke was putting his spare change into piles. He had 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes. If each pile had 3 coins in it, how many coins did he have total? 
                 [/INST] To find the total number of coins Luke has, we need to find the number of coins in each type of pile (quarters and dimes), and then add those quantities together.

First, let's find the number of coins in one pile of quarters:
1 pile of quarters has 5 coins (because there are 5 piles of quarters), and each pile contains 3 coins, so each pile represents 3 * 5 =  fifteen quarters.

Second, let's find the number of coins in one pile of dimes:
1 pile of dimes has 5 coins (because there are 5 piles of dimes), and each pile contains 3 coins, so each pile represents 3 * 5 = fifteen dimes.

Finally, let's find the total number of coins Luke has:
Total number of coins = Number of quarters + Number of dimes
Total number of coins = 15 (quarters per pile) * 5 (piles of quarters) + 15 (dimes per pile) * 5 (piles of dimes)

Calculating this:
Total number of coins = 15 * 5 + 15 * 5
Total number of coins = 75 + 75
Total number of coins = 150

                 [/INST] To find out how many points Gwen and her friends earned, we first need to calculate how many pounds of paper they recycled together, and then find out how many points they earned based on that amount.

Step 1: Calculate the total pounds of paper recycled.
Gwen recycled 5 pounds, and her friends recycled 13 pounds. So, the total pounds of paper recycled is:
5 pounds (Gwen) + 13 pounds (her friends) = 18 pounds

Step 2: Find out how many points they earned.
We know that they earn one point for every 3 pounds of paper recycled. So, the number of points they earned is equal to the total pounds recycled divided by 3:
Number of points = Total pounds recycled / Points per pound
Number of points = 18 pounds / 3 pounds/point
Number of points = 6 points

Step 5: Initial amount = 30 dollars
Gift received = 16 dollars
Amount spent on game = 38 dollars

Step 6: Money after spending on game = Initial amount + Gift received - Amount spent on game

Step 7: Money after spending on game = 30 + 16 - 38

                 [/INST] To find out how many birds the pet store has in total, we first need to find out how many birds are in each cage, and then multiply that number by the number of cages.

First, let's find out how many parrots and parakeets are in each cage:
- Each cage has 8 parrots.
- Each cage has 2 parakeets.

Next, let's find out how many birds are in each type in one cage:
- Parrots per cage: 8
- Parakeets per cage: 2

To find out how many birds are in total in one cage, we add the number of parrots and parakeets:
- Birds per cage: Parrots + Parakeets = 8 + 2 = 10

Since there are 4 cages in the pet store, we can find out how many birds are in the pet store by multiplying the number of birds per cage by the number of cages:
- Total number of birds: Birds per cage * Number of cages = 10 * 4 = 40

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many pictures Robin has in total. She uploaded 31 pictures from her phone and 5 pictures from her camera, so:

Total pictures = Pictures from phone + Pictures from camera
= 31 + 5
= 36

Next, let's determine how many pictures should be in each album if there are to be 9 albums with an equal number of pictures in each. Since there are 36 pictures in total and there are 9 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures in each album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

Pictures in each album = Total pictures / Number of albums
= 36 / 9
= 4

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a picture, Robin will have to put one picture less in one of the albums to make them all equally-filled. Hence, the number of pictures in each album is actually 3.

1. First, let's figure out how many cups of flour Isabel has used for the 3 brownies she has already baked: She used 5 cups of flour for each brownie, so she has used a total of 3 brownies * 5 cups of flour/brownie = <<3*5=15>>15 cups of flour.
2. Next, we need to determine how many cups of flour Isabel needs in total for her party: She baked 3 brownies but needed 5 total, so she still needs to bake and bake 5-3=<<5-3=2>>2 more brownies for her party. Since she uses 5 cups of flour for each brownie, she will need an additional 2 brownies * 5 cups of flour/brownie = <<2*5=10>>10 cups of flour.

The total change in the number of students is the number of students who left minus the number of students who joined. In this case, that's -5 (students left) + 11 (students came) = 6 students.

Step 4: Add the original number of students to the total change in the number of students.
The final number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year is the original number of students plus the total change in the number of students. In this case, that's 31 (students at start) + 6 (total change) = 37 students.

                    question:
                     While shopping, Maria bought 35 green towels and 21 white towels. If she gave her mother 34 of them, how many towels did Maria end up with? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many towels Maria ended up with after giving some to her mother, we first need to determine how many green and white towels she gave away. Since we know she gave her mother 34 towels in total, let's find out how many of them were green and how many were white:

1. We know that Maria initially bought 35 green towels and 21 white towels.
2. She gave away 34 towels to her mother.
3. Let's assume, for now, that all 34 towels were white. Then Maria would have had 35 green towels - 34 towels given away = 1 green towel left. However, this cannot be the case since there were only 21 white towels initially.
4. Instead, let's see if there is a way to divide the 34 towels given away between green and white towels such that Maria still has a reasonable number of each color left.

If we assume half of the towels given away were green and half were white (which is not the case, but let's check if it works), then Mari gave away:
   Green towels = 34 * 1/2 = 17
   White towels = 34 * 1/2 = 17

This would mean Maria initially had:
   Green towels = 35 - 17 = 18
   White towels = 21 - 17 = 4

However, in the original problem, we were told Maria bought more than just a few white towels. So, this distribution of towels given away doesn't hold up. Instead, let's assume Maria gave away all the white towels and only some of the green towels.

Since she initially bought 21 white towels, and she gave away 34 towels, it is not possible for Maria to have given away all the white towels, and thus, kept all the green towels. Therefore, we need to re-examine the number of towels given away or reconsider the problem if further information is provided.

{The final answer is: We cannot determine the exact number of towels Maria ended up with based on the given information.}</s>",22

                 [/INST] Step 1: On Saturday, Paul filled 6 bags with cans. The number of cans in each bag was 8. So, on Saturday, he picked up 6 * 8 = <<6*8=48>>48 cans.

Step 2: On Sunday, Paul filled 3 more bags with cans. Again, the number of cans in each bag was 8. So, on Sunday, he picked up 3 * 8 = <<3*8=24>>24 cans.

Step 3: To find the total number of cans Paul picked up, we simply add the number of cans he picked up on Saturday and the number of cans he picked up on Sunday. So, the total number of cans = 48 + 24 = <<48+24=72>>72 cans.

                 [/INST] To find out how many points Bianca and her friends earned for recycling paper, we first need to determine how many pounds of paper they recycled in total. We know that Bianca recycled 24 pounds and her friends recycled 3 pounds.

Total pounds recycled = Pounds recycled by Bianca + Pounds recycled by her friends
Total pounds recycled = 24 pounds + 3 pounds
Total pounds recycled = 27 pounds

Next, we need to find out how many points they earned for recycling this amount of paper. We know that they earn one point for every 3 pounds recycled.

Number of points earned = Total pounds recycled / Number of pounds required to earn one point
Number of points earned = 27 pounds / 3 pounds per point
Number of points earned ≈ 9

So, Bianca and her friends earned approximately 9 points for recycling paper.

1. The chef had 8 chicken wings cooked before the friends arrived.
2. The friends ordered and the chef cooked 10 more chicken wings for them.

So, the total number of chicken wings cooked is:
Total chicken wings = Cooked before + Cooked for group
= 8 + 10
= 18 chicken wings

Since there are 3 friends in the group, we can divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends to find out how many wings each person got:

{The final answer is: Each person got 6 chicken wings.}

Therefore, the chef cooked 18 chicken wings in total, and each of the 3 friends received 6 chicken wings.</s>",6

                 [/INST] Step 1: John had 33 socks. This number includes the old socks that didn't fit and the new socks he bought. We need to find out how many socks he has after getting rid of the old socks and buying new ones.

Step 2: John threw away 19 old socks that didn't fit. So, the number of socks he had decreased by 19.

Step 3: John bought 13 new socks. Let's add this number to the remaining socks John has.

Step 4: First, let's find out how many socks John had left after giving away the old ones:
   Old socks = 33
   Threw away = 19
   Remaining socks = Old socks - Threw away
   Remaining socks = 33 - 19
   Remaining socks = 14

Step 5: Now, let's add the new socks John bought to the remaining ones:
   Remaining socks = 14
   New socks = 13

                     Roger had 120 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 48 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 9 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each small load, we first need to find out how many pieces of clothing are in the 4 large loads and then subtract that from the total number of pieces and divide by the number of small loads.

1. We know that Roger put 48 pieces of clothing in one load, so each large load contains 48 pieces of clothing.
2. He decided to split the remaining clothing into 9 equal small loads.
3. First, we need to find out how many pieces of clothing are in the 4 large loads: 120 total pieces - 4 * 48 pieces = 120 - 192 = -72

This answer is not correct as it indicates a negative number of pieces, which is not possible. The error in this calculation is that we subtracted 4 * 48 instead of subtracting 4 loads * 48 pieces per load. So, the actual number of pieces in the large loads is 4 * 48 = 192.

4. Now, let's find out how many pieces of clothing go in each small load: Total pieces - Large load pieces / Number of small loads
   = 120 - 192 / 9

To perform this division we can calculate the quotient and then multiply it by 9 to find the number of pieces. The division results into a quotient of 13 pieces per small load and a remaining piece which is equal to 3. Since we cannot have a small load of 13 pieces with an extra piece, as the problem states we need 9 equal loads, thus we have to round up the quotient. Therefore, we add the remaining pieces to the quota until it reaches a multiple of 9.

Final answer: {Each small load should have 14 pieces of clothing}</s>",8

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups the debate team can form with a given number of people, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. Let's go through this step by step.

1. The debate team has 26 boys and 46 girls in total. So, the total number of people is: 26 boys + 46 girls = 72 people
2. Each group consists of 9 people, so we'll divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group to find out how many groups can be formed: 72 people / 9 people/group = 8 groups

Therefore, the debate team can form 8 groups of 9 people each.
{The final answer is 8 groups}</s>",8

                 [/INST] Step 1: The school cafeteria ordered a total of red apples (6) + green apples (15) = {21} apples for the students' lunches.

Step 2: Only 5 students requested fruit for their lunches.

Step 3: To find out how many apples were ordered for those 5 students, we need to determine how many apples correspond to each student. Since there were 21 apples ordered in total, and 5 students requested fruit, we have that each student was given {21 ÷ 5 = 4.2} apples.

Step 4: Since we can't distribute a fraction of an apple, the cafeteria must have given 4 complete apples to each student. Therefore, the cafeteria provided 4 apples × 5 students = {20} apples.

Step 5: To determine how many apples were left over, we subtract the number of apples given to the students from the total number of apples ordered: 21 apples (total) – 20 apples (given to students) = {The final answer is 1 extra apple.}

So, the cafeteria ended up with 1 extra apple.</s>",16

                 [/INST] To find out how many people would be on each team if the 24 people (9 managers and 15 employees) are split into 8 teams, we first need to find the total number of people per team.

1. We have a total of 24 people, so the total number of people in all teams put together is 24.
2. We want to split this number evenly among 8 teams, so we need to find the quotient of the total number of people by the number of teams.
   The number of people per team is the quotient of the total number of people by the number of teams:
   number of people per team = total number of people / number of teams

3. Performing the calculation, we get:
   number of people per team = 24 / 8 = 3 people per team
   However, we cannot have a team with a fractional number of people. Therefore, we must adjust the number by adding an additional person to each team to evenly distribute the group.

   The final answer is: Each team would have 4 people. {The final answer is 4 people per team.}</s>",3

Mike made 42 dollars mowing lawns.
He spent 10 dollars on new mower blades.
So, how much money did Mike have left = Total earnings - Cost of mower blades
= 42 dollars - 10 dollars
= 32 dollars

Step 2: Determine how many 8 dollar games Mike could buy with the remaining money.
The cost of each game = 8 dollars.
So, how many games could Mike buy = Remaining money / Cost of each game
= 32 dollars / 8 dollars
= 4 games

{The final answer is: Mike could buy 4 games with the money he had left.}</s>",4

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes the chef to cook the remaining 8 potatoes, we need to multiply the number of potatoes by the time it takes to cook one potato.

Step 1: Calculate the number of potatoes the chef has already cooked.
The chef has cooked 5 potatoes.

Step 2: Calculate the number of potatoes the chef still needs to cook.
The chef needs to cook 13 potatoes in total, so the number of potatoes he still needs to cook is 13 - 5 = <<13-5=8>>8 potatoes.

Step 3: Multiply the number of potatoes that need to be cooked by the time it takes to cook one potato.
It takes 6 minutes to cook one potato, so it will take 8 potatoes * 6 minutes/potato = <<8*6=48>>48 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.

                     Paige had 43 math problems and 12 science problems for homework. If she finished 44 of the problems at school, how many problems did she have to do for homework? 
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Paige had 43 math problems and 12 science problems for homework.
2. She finished 44 problems at school, but it's not clear whether these were all math problems or science problems, or a mix of both.
3. To find out how many problems Paige still has to do for homework, we need to subtract the number of problems she finished at school from the total number of problems she has.
4. Let's assume that all 44 problems she finished at school were math problems (this would actually give Paige fewer problems to do than stated in the question, but it's a valid interpretation of the problem as given). In that case, she would have completed 43 math problems + 44 math problems = 87 math problems.
5. Since we only know that she had 43 math problems for homework, it seems likely that we made an error in assuming that all 44 problems she finished at school were math problems.
6. Let's try another assumption: that she finished half of her problems at school, and half were math and half were science. In that case, she would have completed 44/2 = 22 problems of each type, for a total of 22 math problems + 22 science problems = 44 problems.
7. The actual number of problems Paige has left to do for homework is therefore the total number of problems she had, minus the number she finished: 43 math problems + 12 science problems - 44 problems = 37 problems.

1. The cost of one rose is $8.
2. Vanessa bought 3 roses, so the cost of the roses is: 3 roses * $8/rose = $24
3. The cost of one daisy is also $8.
4. Vanessa bought 3 daisies, so the cost of the daisies is: 3 daisies * $8/daisy = $24

                 [/INST] To determine how many pictures should be in each album when Olivia has a total of 40 pictures (5 from her phone + 35 from her camera), we need to find the quotient of the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

1. Find the total number of pictures, which is given as 5 (phone) + 35 (camera) = <ins>40</ins> pictures.

2. Divide the total number of pictures by the desired number of albums, 8 in this case: 40 ÷ 8.

3. Perform the division: The quotient is 5 with a remainder of 0. Since we cannot have empty albums, we need to round up the quotient.

Step 1: Determine the total number of cookies Robin has.
Total number of cookies = Chocolate chip cookies + Oatmeal cookies
Total number of cookies = 23 (chocolate chip cookies) + 25 (oatmeal cookies)
Total number of cookies = 48

Step 2: Calculate the number of baggies Robin can make.
Number of baggies = Total number of cookies / Cookies per baggie
Number of baggies = 48 (total cookies) / 6 (cookies per baggie)

Number of baggIES = 8 {This says ""bagges"" instead of ""baggies,"" but it's close enough to the intended answer. To get the correct answer, divide the total number of cookies by 6}

                 [/INST] To find out how many cages the pet store used, we first need to determine how many puppies were left unsold.

1. The pet store had 88 puppies in total.
2. They sold 34 puppies, so that leaves: 88 (total) - 34 (sold) = 54 puppies unsold.

Now we know that 6 puppies fit into each cage. We need to find out how many cages they used to put the unsold puppies in.

3. To find the number of cages, we divide the number of unsold puppies by the number of puppies per cage: 54 (unsold) ÷ 6 (per cage) = 9 cages with 54/6 = ↑9 ≈ 9.6 ≈ 10 puppies each. Since there cannot be a fraction of a cage, they used an additional cage to fit the remaining 2 puppies. So there are 10 cages in total.

First, let's find out how many trays Jerry can carry in one trip: Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time.

Next, let's find out how many trips it takes to pick up all the trays from both tables. There are 9 trays on the first table, and Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time. So, Jerry will need to make 2 trips to pick up all the trays from the first table (since 9 trays divided by 8 is 1 with a remainder of 1).

Now, there are 7 trays on the second table. Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, so he'll be able to carry all the trays from the second table in one trip.

                 [/INST] To find out how many folders Wendy ended up with, we first need to determine how many files she had left after deleting 37.

Initial number of files: 82
Files deleted: 37
Number of files remaining: 82 - 37 = 45

Now we know there are 5 files in each folder. So to find out how many folders Wendy ended up with, we divide the number of remaining files by the number of files per folder.

Files per folder: 5
Number of folders: 45 ÷ 5 = 9

However, there seems to be a mistake in the problem as there are not enough files to put into 9 folders with 5 files each (45 ≤ 5 * 9). Let's assume there is a mistake in the problem statement and verify the number of files left after deletion is indeed sufficient to arrange them into folders with 5 files each.

We'll check if the remainder of dividing the number of remaining files by the number of files per folder is zero or close to zero. If it is, we can assume Wendy put any extra files left into a single additional folder.

Remainder: 45 % 5 = 0

Since the remainder is zero, it's a good indication we have an accurate solution. Therefore, Wendy ended up with 9 folders for her files.

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups there would be with 8 players in each group, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.

Step 1: Find the total number of players.
Total players = New players + Returning players
Total players = 12 + 44
Total players = 56

Step 2: Divide the total number of players by the number of players per group.
Number of groups = Total players / Players per group
Number of groups = 56 / 8

Step 3: Perform the long division or round up and divide to find the quotient.
Number of groups = 7 with a remainder of 2

Step 4: Since we cannot have a group with only 2 players, we will need an additional group to accommodate the remaining players.

Thus, the final answer is: {There will be 8 groups with 8 players each, and 1 additional group with 2 remaining players}. Alternatively, without creating an additional group, the answer would be: {There would be 7 groups with 8 players each and 1 leftover player}.</s>",7

                     Will made 104 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 41 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 9 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how much money Will had left after buying the mower blades.
Will made 104 dollars mowing lawns.
He spent 41 dollars on mower blades.
So, the amount of money left with Will is: 104 dollars (what he made) - 41 dollars (what he spent on mower blades) = <<104-41=63>>63 dollars

Step 2: Determine how many 9 dollar games Will could buy with the remaining money.
The price of each game is 9 dollars.
Therefore, the number of games Will could buy is: 63 dollars (the remaining money) / 9 dollars (the cost of each game) = <<63/9=7.0>>7.0 games
Since you cannot buy a fraction of a game, this means Will could buy 7 games.

{The final answer is: Will could buy 7 games.}</s>",7

1. We know that each flower (rose or daisy) costs $3.
2. Emily purchased 2 roses and 2 daisies.
3. So, the total number of flowers she bought is 2 (roses) + 2 (daisies) = 4 flowers.
4. Since each flower costs $3, the total amount she spent is the number of flowers multiplied by the cost per flower: 4 (flowers) * $3 (cost per flower) = $12.

                 [/INST] To find out how many cages were used, we first need to determine how many puppies were left unsold after the store sold 7 of them. We know that the pet store had 13 puppies in total.

Step 1: Find the number of puppies sold.
sold = 7

Step 2: Subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies to find the number of puppies left:
remaining = total_puppies - sold
remaining = 13 - 7
remaining = 6

Next, we know that the remaining puppies were put into cages, with each cage holding 2 puppies. Therefore, we can divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies each cage can hold to find the number of required cages.

Step 3: Divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage to find the number of cages:
cages = remaining_puppies / puppies_per_cage
cages = 6 / 2
cages = 3

However, since a cage can hold a maximum of 2 puppies, this result is not possible, as each cage can only accommodate 2 puppies. It seems there might be an error in the question or the information provided.

Therefore, we cannot determine the valid number of cages with the given information.

                 [/INST] To find out how many bad carrots there were, we first need to determine the total number of carrots they picked, and then subtract the good ones from that number.

Step 1: Find the total number of carrots picked by Faye and her mother.
Faye picked 23 carrots.
Her mother picked 5 carrots.
Total = 23 (Faye) + 5 (Her mother) = 28 carrots

Step 2: Determine the number of good carrots.
There were 12 good carrots.

Step 3: Find the number of bad carrots.
Since we know the total number of carrots picked and the number of good carrots, we can calculate the number of bad carrots by subtracting the good carrots from the total.

Bad carrots = Total carrots - Good carrots
Bad carrots = 28 carrots - 12 good carrots = 16 carrots

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many bouquets Isabel made with the 66 flowers.
At first, Isabel made bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. So, the number of bouquets she made is:
[66 Flowers] / [8 Flowers per Bouquet] = 8.25
Since Isabel can't make a fraction of a bouquet, she made 8 bouquets with the remaining 48 flowers and ran out of flowers for the 19th bouquet.

Step 2: Calculate how many flowers were used in the bouquets that didn't wilt.
She made 8 bouquets with 48 flowers, so:
[Number of Flowers in Bouquets That Didn't Wilt] = 8 Bouquets * 8 Flowers/Bouquet = 64 Flowers

Step 3: Subtract the flowers that wilted from the total number of flowers Isabel had.
[Total Flowers Isabel Had] = 66
[Flowers That Wilted] = 10
So, [Number of Flowers Isabel Had Left] = 66 - 10 = 56

Step 4: Find out how many bouquets Isabel could make with the flowers she had left.
Since each bouquet requires 8 flowers, Isabel could make:
[Number of Bouquets She Could Still Make] = [Number of Flowers She Had Left] / [Number of Flowers per Bouquet] = 56/8 = 7 bouquets

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of tickets used for riding the ferris wheel.
Since Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times and each ride cost 7 tickets, we have:
Tickets for ferris wheel = Rides on ferris wheel * Tickets per ride
= 5 * 7
= 35 tickets

Step 2: Calculate the number of tickets used for riding the bumper cars.
Since Oliver rode the bumper cars 4 times and each ride cost 7 tickets, we have:
Tickets for bumper cars = Rides on bumper cars * Tickets per ride
= 4 * 7
= 28 tickets

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tickets used.
Since Oliver used tickets for both the ferris wheel and bumper cars, we add the number of tickets for each:

Ned bought 50 games from his friend and 27 games at the garage sale. So, in total, he bought 50 + 27 = <br> 77 games.

Step 2: Determine how many games didn't work.
Ned mentioned that 74 of the games didn't work.

Step 3: Find out how many good games Ned has.
To calculate this, we need to find the difference between the total number of games Ned bought and the number of games that didn't work: 77 (total games) - 74 (games that didn't work) = <br> 3 games.

However, Ned bought 3 games himself that weren't mentioned in the question, so those games are included in the 3 ""good"" games calculated above.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find out how many cats of each type were sold during the sale.

Since there were 38 siamese cats and 25 house cats in total, and they sold 45 cats, we need to determine how many of each type were sold.
Let x be the number of siamese cats sold and y be the number of house cats sold.
So, x + y = 45 (Equation 1)

We know that there were 38 siamese cats initially, so x = 38 (Siamese cats sold)
Substituting x in Equation 1, we get:
38 + y = 45
y = 7

And thus, there were 7 house cats sold.

Step 2: Now, to find out how many cats are left in the store, we subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number.

The number of siamese cats left is: 38 (initially) - 38 (sold) = 0
The number of house cats left is: 25 (initially) - 7 (sold) = 18

1. Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy, so the total number of pieces he initially had is:
   Number of pieces = Number of boxes * Pieces per box
   = 12 boxes * 3 pieces/box
   = 36 pieces

2. Dave gave 5 boxes to his little brother. The number of pieces his brother received is:
   Number of pieces for the brother = Number of boxes * Pieces per box
   = 5 boxes * 3 pieces/box
   = 15 pieces

3. To find the number of pieces Dave still has, we need to subtract the number of pieces his brother received from the initial number of pieces:

                    question:
                     The cafeteria had 50 apples. For lunch they handed out 5 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 5 apples, how many pies could they make? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: The cafeteria started with 50 apples.
Step 2: They gave 5 apples to students, so there are now 45 apples left.
Step 3: Each pie requires 5 apples.
Step 4: To find out how many pies they can make with the remaining apples, we divide the number of apples by the number of apples needed per pie.
Pies = Total apples / Apples per pie
Pies = 45 / 5
Step 5: Perform the division: Pies = 9
Step 6: Since we cannot make a fraction of a pie, they can only make 9 pies with the remaining apples.

{The final answer is 9 pies}.</s>",9

                    question:
                     Oliver had 33 dollars in January. By March he had spent 4 dollars. If he got another 32 dollars from his mom, how much money would he have? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: In January, Oliver had 33 dollars.
 Step 2: By March, he had spent 4 dollars. So, the amount of money Oliver had in March was:
      Amount of money in March =Amount of money in January - Amount spent in March
      Amount of money in March = 33 dollars - 4 dollars
      Amount of money in March = 29 dollars
 Step 3: Oliver then received another 32 dollars from his mom.
 Step 4: To find the total amount of money Oliver has now, we add the amount of money he had in March to the amount his mom gave him.
 Total amount of money = Amount of money in March + Amount received from mom
 Total amount of money = 29 dollars + 32 dollars

{The final answer is: 61 dollars}</s>",61

                    question:
                     The school cafeteria had 14 apples. If they used 13 to make lunch for the students and then bought 49 more, how many apples would they have? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: The school cafeteria had 14 apples.

Step 2: They used 13 apples to make lunch for the students, so now they have:
14 (initial apples) - 13 (used apples) = 1 apple left

Step 3: They bought 49 more apples, so now they have:
1 (apple left) + 49 (new apples) = 50 apples

Step 4: However, we made an error in our calculation. We subtracted 13 apples from 14, but we should have subtracted them from 15 (the number of apples after possibly having bought more before the event described in the question). So, let's correct this error:

Step 5: They had 15 apples (initial apples), and they used 13 apples. This leaves 2 apples. Then they bought 49 apples, which adds 49 apples. Therefore, they have:
2 (apples remaining after using 13) + 49 (newly bought) = 51 apples

{The final answer is 51 apples.}</s>",50

                 [/INST] Solution:

1. First, let's find out how many questions Frank answered correctly in total during the game. He answered 3 questions correctly in the first half and 2 questions correctly in the second half. So,
   Total number of correct answers = Questions answered in first half + Questions answered in second half
   = 3 + 2
   = 5.

2. As stated in the problem, each question was worth 3 points. So, the total number of points Frank earned is:
   Total points = Number of correct answers x Points per question
   = 5 x 3
   = 15.

{The final answer is: Frank's final score was 15 points.}</s>",15

                    question:
                     Zoe was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 8 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 4 scarves and 6 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Zoe have total? 
                 [/INST] To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing Zoe has, we need to find out how many scarves and mittens are in each box, and then multiply that by the number of boxes.

First, let's find out how many pieces of clothing are in each box. We know that there are 4 scarves and 6 mittens in each box, so:

Number of pieces in one box = Scarves + Mittens
= 4 scarves + 6 mittens
= 10 pieces

Now, to find out how many pieces of winter clothing Zoe has in total, we need to find out how many boxes she has and then multiply that by the number of pieces in each box.

Total number of pieces = Number of boxes * Pieces per box
= 8 boxes * 10 pieces
= 80 pieces

{The final answer is: Zoe has a total of 80 pieces of winter clothing.}</s>",80

                    question:
                     Frank and his friend were buying trick decks from the magic shop for 7 dollars each. How much did they spend if Frank bought 3 decks and his friend bought 2 decks? 
                 [/INST] To determine how much Frank and his friend spent on buying trick decks, we first need to find out how much each person spent on their individual purchases.

Step 1: Find the cost of one deck for Frank.
Cost of one deck for Frank = Price per deck

Step 2: Find the cost of Frank's purchase (3 decks).
Cost of Frank's purchase = Cost of one deck * Number of decks purchased by Frank
Cost of Frank's purchase = $7 * 3 = $21

Step 3: Find the cost of one deck for Frank's friend.
Cost of one deck for Frank's friend = Price per deck

Step 4: Find the cost of Frank's friend's purchase (2 decks).
Cost of Frank's friend's purchase = Cost of one deck * Number of decks purchased by Frank's friend
Cost of Frank's friend's purchase = $7 * 2 = $14

Step 5: Add the cost of both purchases to find the total amount spent.
Total amount spent = Cost of Frank's purchase + Cost of Frank's friend's purchase
Total amount spent = $21 + $14 = $35

{The final answer is: They spent a total of $35 on buying trick decks.}</s>",35

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Sam had to wash a total of 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts. So the total number of shirts he had to wash is:
40 short sleeve shirts + 23 long sleeve shirts = 63 shirts

Step 2: We are told that by the time school started, Sam had washed 29 shirts. So to find out how many shirts he had not washed yet, we subtract the number of shirts he had washed from the total number of shirts he had to wash:
Total shirts to wash - Shirts washed = Shirts not washed
63 shirts - 29 shirts = 34 shirts

The final answer is: Sam had not washed 34 shirts.</s>",34

                 [/INST] Step 1: We are given that the waiter had 47 customers initially.

Step 2: Then, 41 customers left, so the number of customers remaining is: 47 (initial customers) - 41 (customers who left) = {36 customers}

Step 3: Afterward, the waiter got another 20 customers. So, to find the total number of customers the waiter is currently serving, we add the remaining customers to the new customers who arrived: 36 (remaining customers) + 20 (new customers) = {56 customers}
