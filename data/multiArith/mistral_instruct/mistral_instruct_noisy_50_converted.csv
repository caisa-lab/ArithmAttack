                 [/INST] Step 1: Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player.

Step 2: She deleted 9 old songs from it. So the number of songs left on her mp3 player after deleting old songs is:

11 (initial number of songs) - 9 (number of deleted songs) = 2 songs

Step 3: Later, she added 8 new songs to her mp3 player. So the final number of songs on her mp3 player is:

2 (remaining songs after deleting) + 8 (newly added songs) = 10 songs

                    question:
                    !  There were , 39 girls ? and 4 boys ? trying out for the ! schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called ; back, how many students ? didn't make the cut? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many students did not make the cut, we first need to find out how many were called back. since there were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out, and 26 of them were called back, we have:

number of students called back = number of girls + number of boys
= 39 + 4
= 43 (This is incorrect, as there are only 26 students called back.)

This result is incorrect because the number of students called back (26) is less than the number of students calculated in the previous step (43). This discrepancy arises because there was an error in the given information. The problem states that ""26 of them got called back,"" which implies that 26 is the total number of students who made the team. Therefore, the number of students who didn't make the cut is:

total number of students trying out = number of students called back + number of students not called back
= 26 + number_of_students_not_called_back

To find the number of students not called back, we can substitute the given value for the number of students who were called back (26) and solve for the unknown (number_of_students_not_called_back):

total number of students trying out = 26 + number_of_students_not_called_back
number_of_students_not_called_back = total number of students trying out - number of students called back
= 39 + 4 - 26
= 13

{The final answer is: 13 students didn't make the cut.}</s>",17,17.0,13.0

                 [/INST] Step 1: Faye started with 34 coloring books.

Step 2: She gave away 3 coloring books, so she had 34 - 3 = 31 coloring books left.

Step 3: Then, she bought 48 more coloring books.

Step 4: To find the total number of coloring books Faye has now, we need to add the number of coloring books she had left after giving some away to the number of coloring books she bought.

Step 5: Therefore, {The final answer is: 31 (initial) + 48 (bought) = 79 coloring books}</s>",79,79.0,79.0

                 [/INST] To find out how many apples the school cafeteria has after using some for lunch and buying more, we need to follow these steps:

1. Subtract the number of apples used for making lunch from the initial number of apples.
Apples used for lunch = 20
Initial number of apples = 23
So, the number of apples remaining before buying new ones = 23 - 20 = ³³.

2. Add the number of new apples bought to the remaining ones.
New apples bought = 6
So, the total number of apples the school cafeteria has = ³³ + 6.

                 [/INST] Step 1: we are given that each enemy defeated earns 9 points.

Step 2: There are 11 enemies in total in a level.

Step 3: We have defeated or destroyed all but 3 of these enemies. So the number of enemies defeated is 11 - 3 = 8.

Step 4: Therefore, the number of points earned would be the number of enemies defeated multiplied by the points earned per enemy, i.e., 8 * 9 = 72 points.

1. We know that each rose was on sale for $4.
2. April started with 13 roses.
3. We're told that she had 4 roses left.
4. To find out how much money April earned, we need to find out how much she paid for the roses she bought during the sale.
5. The number of roses April bought is the difference between the initial number of roses and the final number of roses. So, the number of roses April bought is 13 (initial) - 9 (final) = 4 roses.
6. Since each rose cost $4 during the sale, the total amount April paid for the roses she bought is 4 roses * $4 per rose = $16.

Given:
- Ned had 9 short sleeve shirts.
- Ned had 21 long sleeve shirts.

Total number of shirts Ned had = 9 (short sleeve) + 21 (long sleeve) = 30 shirts

The problem states that Ned had washed 29 shirts by the time school started. To find the number of shirts Ned did not wash, we subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts he had.

Number of shirts Ned did not wash = Total number of shirts - Number of shirts he washed
= 30 shirts - 29 shirts
= 1 shirt

                 [/INST] Step 1: We're given that 47 people were invited to a luncheon, but 7 of them didn't show up. So the number of people that actually attended the luncheon was 40 (47 invited - 7 no-shows).

Step 2: We're also told that each table can hold 5 people. Therefore, to determine how many tables are needed, we simply divide the number of people that attended by the number of people each table can hold.

Step 3: Calculation: Number of tables = Total number of people / Capacity of each table
= 40 people / 5 people per table
= 8 tables

So, they need 8 tables to accommodate all the attendees.

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. Tom originally had 5 books.
2. He sold 4 books, so we subtract 4 from the original number of books: 5 - 4 = 1 book.
3. Tom used the money earned from selling the 4 books to buy 38 new books. We don't know the price of each new book, but we do know that Tom bought 38 new books.
4. Let x be the cost of one new book. Then, the cost of all 38 new books is 38x.
5. We also know that Tom earned enough money from selling 4 books to buy 38 new books. So, 4(original price of one book) = 38x.
6. Solving for x, we get x = 4/38 * original price of one book.
7. Substituting x back into the equation for the total number of books Tom now has, we get: 1(original) + 38(4/38 * original)
8. Simplifying this expression: 1 + 38(4/38) * original.
9. The equation simplifies to: 1 + 4 * original.
10. The final answer depends on the value of ""original"", which represents the original number of books Tom had.

                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Jerry needs to fill up for storing all the sodas, we first need to determine the total number of sodas he bought, and then divide that number by the capacity of each shelf.

1. Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. So, the total number of sodas he bought is:

41 (regular sodas) + 22 (diet sodas) = 63 sodas

2. Each shelf can hold 9 sodas. To find out how many shelves Jerry needs, we divide the total number of sodas by the capacity of each shelf:

63 sodas ÷ 9 sodas/shelf = 7 shelves (with some remaining capacity)

{Since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, Jerry would need to fill up 7 shelves with all his sodas.}

Therefore, Jerry would need 7 shelves to fill up all of his purchased sodas in his fridge.</s>",7,7.0,7.0

   Debby had 32 pieces, and her sister had 42 pieces. So the total number of candies they had is:
   32 (Debby's candies) + 42 (sister's candies) = 74 pieces

Step 2: Find out how many pieces they ate on the first night.
   They ate 35 pieces. So the number of candies they have left is:

1. We know that Emily started with 41 seeds. She planted 29 of them in the big garden and the rest in the small gardens. So the number of seeds planted in the small gardens is 41 - 29 = 12 seeds.
2. Since Emily put 4 seeds in each of her small gardens, the number of small gardens she has is 12 seeds / 4 seeds/garden = 3 gardens.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of candies Emily received.
Emily received candies from neighbors: 5 pieces/day * 31 days = 155 pieces
Emily received candies from her older sister: 13 pieces
Total candies received by Emily = 155 + 13 = 168 pieces

Step 2: Find out how many days the candies would last her if she ate 9 pieces a day.
Candies last = Total candies / Pieces eaten per day
Candies last = 168 / 9

Step 3: Simplify the fraction to find the number of days.
The simplified form of 168/9 is approximately 18.67 (using long division or a calculator)
However, since Emily cannot eat a fraction of a day's worth of candy, we'll have to round down to the nearest whole number.

Step 2: Next, we need to find out how many shelves Mike will need to fit all his books. We're told that he can put 9 books on each shelf, so we can calculate the number of shelves needed by dividing the total number of books he has by the number of books that can fit on one shelf.

Total number of books: 72 books
Number of books per shelf: 9 books

Shelves needed = Total number of books / Books per shelf

                 [/INST] First, let's determine how many customers left a tip. We know that 5 out of every 7 customers didn't leave a tip. This is an example of a ratio problem: 5 non-tippers (B) for every 2 tippers (A). To find the number of tippers, we can set up a proportion:

5 (non-tippers) : 2 (tippers) = x (number of tippers) : 7 (total customers)

Transposing the ratio to make x the subject:

x = (2 × 7) / 5 = 14 / 5

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

x = 2.8

Since x represents the number of tippers, this means that there are 2 tippers. Hence, there are 5-2 = 3 non-tippers, and:

7 (total customers) = 2 (tippers) + 5 (non-tippers)

So, there are 2 tippers and 5 non-tippers, and the waiter earned money from 2 tippers.

Each tipper left $3 for the waiter, so:

Money earned = Money per tip × Number of tippers
Money earned = $3/tipper × 2 tippers
Money earned = $6

1. John earns $8 for each lawn he mows.
2. He had 15 lawns to mow in total.
3. However, he forgot to mow 7 of them.

First, let's calculate how much John would have earned if he mowed all 15 lawns:
15 lawns * $8/lawn = $120

Next, since he only mowed 8 lawns, we can calculate how much he earned from that:
8 lawns * $8/lawn = $64

However, we need to subtract the money he lost from not mowing the 7 lawns:
$120 (total potential earnings) - $64 (actual earnings) = $56

3. Every day, 8 puppies are adopted.
4. We want to find out how long it would take for all 40 puppies to be adopted.

To calculate this, we just need to find out how many days it takes to adopt out all 40 puppies:

                 [/INST] First, we need to determine how many windows the builder still needs to install. We know that 6 windows have already been installed and 9 windows are needed in total. So, we subtract the number of installed windows from the total number of windows required.

6 installed windows - 9 required windows = -3 windows

However, it appears that there has been a mistake in the question as the number of installed windows is more than the required number, resulting in a negative number. Let's assume that the correct number of installed windows is less than the required number.

Now, we can calculate how many windows remain to be installed, which is 9 - 6 = 3 windows.

Finally, we can find the time it takes to install each window and multiply it by the number of windows that need to be installed to find the total installation time.

3 windows * 6 hours/window = 18 hours

0.5 treasures * 9 points per treasure = 4.5 points

On the second level, she found 2 treasures, so she scored:
2 treasures * 9 points per treasure = 18 points

Step 3: Calculate Rachel's total score
To find Rachel's total score, we add the points she earned on each level:

1. First, let's find the total number of members in the team: 5 boys + 40 girls = 45 members
2. Now, we want to find out how many groups can be made when each group consists of 9 members:
3. Use the formula for finding the number of groups: number_of_groups = total_members / number_of_members_per_group
4. In our case, total_members = 45 and number_of_members_per_group = 9
5. So, number_of_groups = 45 / 9
6. Calculate the quotient: 5 (remainder) 1 = 5/9
7. Since we can't have a fraction as a number of groups, we have to round this value up to get the number of complete groups and subtract it from the quotient to find the number of groups needing one additional member ( partial groups).

Since we have two unknowns (number of Siamese cats sold 'x' and number of house cats sold, which is also x because all given numbers are the same for both types of cats), and only one equation (the equation for the total number of remaining cats), we need to make some assumptions or find another piece of information to determine a unique solution.

In this case, assuming that no cats were returned, the total number of cats that remain must be less than or equal to the initial number of cats.

Let's consider the following possibilities:

Scenario 1: All cats sold were Siamese cats.
In this case, Siamese cats remaining = 0, and house cats remaining = 5

However, if all cats sold during the sale were Siamese cats, we would not have valid solutions since there should still be some Siamese cats left (initially, there were 13).

Scenario 2: All cats sold were house cats.
In this case, Siamese cats remaining = 13, and house cats remaining = 0

Again, this is not a valid solution since there should still be some house cats left (initially, there were 5 house cats).

Since neither of these extremes is a valid solution, it's likely that some Siamese cats and some house cats were sold. Therefore, we need more information to solve this problem.

We need to know either the exact number of each type of cat sold or the total number of each type of cat that the pet store initially had. With this information, we can calculate the remaining number of each type of cat after the sale and find a valid solution.

Unfortunately, without this information, we cannot determine the exact number of cats left at the pet store.

Therefore, the problem does not have a clear answer.

Step 1: Calculate Victor's earnings for each day
Victor worked for 5 hours at $6 per hour, so his earnings for Monday were:
5 hours * $6/hour = $30

And he worked for the same number of hours (5) and wage rate ($6) on Tuesday, so his earnings for Tuesday were also $30.

Step 2: Add the earnings from both days to find the total

                 [/INST] The total number of players in the game after the new players joined is the original number of friends plus the number of new players.

Let's denote the number of original friends as x. Therefore:
x (original friends) + 2 (new players) = total number of players.

The total number of lives in the game is the number of players multiplied by the number of lives each player has.

Given that each player has 6 lives, the total number of lives is:
Total lives = x (original friends) × 6 (lives per player) + 2 (new players) × 6 (lives per player).

Substituting the given information into the equation:
Total lives = x × 6 + 2 × 6 = x × 6 + 12.

To find the value of x, we need more information. In its current form, the equation only indicates that the total number of lives is x × 6 + 12. Since x is unknown, we cannot determine the exact total number of lives.

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many people are going on the field trip in total. We have 12 students, and each student takes up 1 space. So, the number of students is the number of spaces they take up.

Students = 12 students * 1 space per student = 12 spaces

 Next, we have 3 adults. Each adult takes up 1 space as well. So, the number of spaces for the adults is also 3.

Adults = 3 adults * 1 space per adult = 3 spaces

In order to find the total number of spaces needed, we add the number of spaces for students and spaces for adults:

Total spaces needed = Spaces for students + Spaces for adults = 12 + 3 = 15 spaces

 Then, we divide the total number of spaces needed by the number of spaces each van can hold to find the number of vans needed:

Number of vans = Total spaces needed / Spaces each van can hold = 15 / 5 = 3 vans

Step 2: They used 20 apples to make lunch for the students. So, they subtracted these apples from the initial amount: 38 (initial apples) - 20 (used apples) = 18 apples remaining.

Step 3: Then, they bought an additional 28 apples. So, we add these apples to the remaining amount: 18 (remaining apples) + 28 (new apples) = 46 apples in total.

                 [/INST] To find out how many trips Luke will make to pick up all the trays, we need to calculate the number of trips required for each table and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many trips Luke will make to pick up trays from one table. We know that there are 20 trays and Luke can carry 4 trays at a time.

Number of trips for one table = Total number of trays / Number of trays Luke can carry at a time
Number of trips for one table = 20 / 4
Number of trips for one table = 5 trips

Next, let's find out how many trips Luke will make to pick up trays from the other table. We know that there are 16 trays.

Number of trips for the other table = Total number of trays / Number of trays Luke can carry at a time
Number of trips for the other table = 16 / 4
Number of trips for the other table = 4 trips

Finally, we add the number of trips required for both tables to find the total number of trips Luke will make.

Total number of trips = Number of trips for one table + Number of trips for the other table
Total number of trips = 5 + 4
Total number of trips = 9 trips

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of apples given to students.
96 apples (total) -> 42 apples (given to students)

Step 2: Find out how many apples were left for making pies.
Remaining apples = Total apples - Apples given to students
Remaining apples = 96 - 42
Remaining apples = 54

Step 3: Determine the number of pies that can be made with the remaining apples.
1 pie = 6 apples
Number of pies = Remaining apples / Apples per pie
Number of pies = 54 / 6

Step 4: Calculate the exact number of pies.
Number of pies ≈ 9 (with rounding down)

However, it's common in baking to round up to ensure every pie has enough apples. So let's round up and check how many pies this results in.

Step 5: Calculate the number of pies rounding up. (Number of pies = (Total apples / Apples per pie) + 1)
Number of pies = (96 / 6) + 1

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 8 friends playing the video game online.
2. Then, 2 more players joined the game, increasing the total number of players to 10.
3. Each player had 6! (factorial) lives in the game. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. So, 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720 lives for each player.
4. To find the total number of lives for all the players, we need to multiply the number of players by the number of lives each player has.

Thus, the final answer is: {The total number of lives is 10 (number of players) × 720 (lives per player) = 7,200 lives}.</s>",60,60.0,7200.0

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Bianca received a total of 78 pieces of candy.

Step 2: She ate 30 pieces of candy, which leaves her with:
Total received = Total eaten + Remaining
78 = 30 + Remaining

Step 3: To find the number of pieces of candy left after eating, we can subtract the number of pieces she ate from the total number of pieces she received:
Remaining = Total received - Total eaten
Remaining = 78 - 30 = 48

Step 4: We know that Bianca put the rest of her candy into piles, with 8 pieces in each pile.

Step 5: To find the number of piles she could make, we can divide the number of pieces of candy left by the number of pieces in each pile:
Number of piles = Total pieces remaining / Pieces per pile
Number of piles = 48 / 8

Step 6: Simplifying the fraction, we get:
Number of piles = 6

- She lost 6 lives in the hard part of the game
- She got 37 more lives in the next level

Step 3: Calculate the number of lives Wendy has after losing 6 lives and gaining 37 additional lives
Lives before losing 6 = 100
Lives after losing 6 = 100 - 6 = 94

Frank made $19 and spent $11 on new mower blades. Therefore, the amount of money he had left is:
$19 (amount earned) - $11 (amount spent on mower blades) = $8

Step 2: Determine how many $2 games Frank could buy with the remaining money.
We want to find out how many $2 games Frank could buy. Since each game costs $2, we can simply divide the amount of money Frank has left by the cost of one game to find out how many games he can buy:

Step 1: Determine the total number of players.
New players = 48
Returning players = 6
Total players = New players + Returning players
Total players = 48 + 6
Total players = 54

Step 2: Divide the total number of players by the number of players per group.
Number of groups = Total players / Players per group
Number of groups = 54 / 6

Number of groups = 9 with a remainder of 0

However, since we cannot have an empty group, we need to add one more group for the remaining players:

                 [/INST] Here's the step-by-step reasoning for this problem:

1. Nancy had 80 files in total.
2. She deleted 31 files, leaving her with 49 files still (80 - 31 = 49).
3. Nancy put the remaining files into folders, with each folder containing 7 files.
4. To determine the number of folders, divide the number of files by the number of files per folder: 49 files / 7 files per folder ≈ 7 folders. However, since Nancy can't have a fraction of a folder, she needs an entire number of folders. So, she would need at least 8 folders (since 7 * 8 = 56, and 56 < 49, we need at least one more folder).
5. But, since Nancy had exactly 80 files to begin with and deleted 31 of them, we know that she actually ended up with 10 folders, each having 7 files, and one empty folder (because there were not enough files to fill the last 3 folders completely).

Given: Luke started with 39 games. He sold 19 games.

Subtraction: 39 (initial games) - 19 (sold games) = 20 games left

Next, we need to determine how many games are in each box.

Given: Each box holds 4 games.

Now, we can calculate how many boxes Luke needs to use for the remaining games.

Division: Total games remaining / Games per box = Number of boxes

20 games left / 4 games per box = 5 boxes required

Therefore, Luke had to use 5 boxes to store the rest of his old games.

1. We have 65 students trying out for the school's trivia teams.
2. 17 of them didn't get picked for the teams, so there are 48 students who were picked.
3. These 48 students were put into 8 groups.

                 [/INST] Let's reason through this problem step by step:

1. Isabel uploaded a total of 25 pictures to Facebook.
2. She put 10 pictures into one album.
3. So, the number of pictures in the first album is 10.
4. The remaining pictures were distributed among 5 different albums.
5. To find out how many pictures are in each of the remaining 5 albums, we first need to determine how many pictures are in each of these albums together.
6. Since there are 5 albums, and there are 25 pictures in total (with 10 in one album), then the number of pictures in all the remaining albums is:
   total number of pictures - pictures in first album
   = 25 - 10
   = 15
7. Since there are 5 albums with 15 pictures in total, we can divide the number of pictures in the remaining albums by the number of albums:
   number of pictures per album = total number of pictures in remaining albums / number of remaining albums
   = 15 / 5
   = 3

Therefore, each of the remaining 5 albums contains 3 pictures.

2. Mike spends 5 dollars a week on things other than mowing or weed eating.
3. To find out how long his money will last, we need to divide his total earnings by his weekly expenses: 40 dollars / 5 dollars per week = <<40/5=8>>8 weeks.

First, let's find out how many short sleeve shirts Dave washed before school:

1. Dave had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts.
2. He managed to wash some number 'x' of them before school started, so the number of short sleeve shirts he did not wash is 9 - x.

Now, let's find out how many long sleeve shirts Dave washed before school:

1. Dave had to wash 27 long sleeve shirts.
2. He managed to wash 20 of them before school started, so the number of long sleeve shirts he did not wash is 27 - 20 = 7.

Finally, we can find the total number of shirts Dave did not wash:

1. He did not wash x short sleeve shirts and 7 long sleeve shirts.

The problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact number of short sleeve shirts that Dave washed before school started (x). So, we can't find a definitive answer for the number of shirts he did not wash.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of puppies at the shelter.
The shelter had 2 puppies initially, and then 34 more were brought in. So the total number of puppies is 2 (initial) + 34 (new intake) = 36 puppies.

Step 2: Determine how many puppies are adopted each day.
According to the problem, 4 puppies are adopted each day.

Step 3: Determine how long it takes to adopt all of the puppies.
To find out how long it takes to adopt all of the puppies, we divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted each day.

Time to adopt all puppies = Total number of puppies / Puppies adopted per day
= 36 puppies / 4 puppies per day
= 9 days

                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many pieces of clothing are in each small load. We know that Will put 32 pieces in one load, and he wanted to split the remaining pieces into 9 equal loads. 

To find the number of pieces in each small load, we'll subtract the number of pieces in the large load from the total number of pieces, and divide that difference by the number of small loads:

Total number of pieces: 59
Number of pieces in large load: 32

Number of pieces in small loads = Total number of pieces - Number of pieces in large load / Number of small loads

Number of pieces in small loads = 59 - 32 / 9

Number of pieces in small loads = 11.111111111111113

Since we can't have a fraction of a piece of clothing, we'll round down to the nearest whole number:

Number of pieces in small loads = 11

{The final answer is: Each small load can hold 11 pieces of clothing.}</s>",3,3.0,11.0

                 [/INST] Step 1: We are given that Adam bought 2 boxes of chocolate candy, and each box contains 4 pieces. So, the number of pieces of chocolate candy Adam has is 2 boxes * 4 pieces per box = <<2*4=8>>8 pieces.

Step 2: Next, we are given that Adam bought 5 boxes of caramel candy, and each box contains 4 pieces. So, the number of pieces of caramel candy Adam has is 5 boxes * 4 pieces per box = <<5*4=20>>20 pieces.

Step 3: To find the total number of pieces of candy that Adam bought, we simply add the number of pieces of chocolate candy and the number of pieces of caramel candy together: 8 pieces of chocolate + 20 pieces of caramel = <<8+20=28>><<1:8+1:20=1:28>>28 pieces in total.

                     . April's ? discount flowers , was ! having a sale where : each . flower was 6 ? dollars. : If ; Katie bought 5 ! roses ; and 5 daisies, how much . did she spend? ; 
                 [/INST] Step 1: We need to find the price of each rose and each daisy during the sale. We are given that each flower is discounted by 6 dollars. However, it's not clear if this discount is applied to the original price or if the original price is 6 dollars and the discounted price is 0. For simplicity, let's assume the original price of a flower is $x.

Step 2: Since each flower is discounted by 6 dollars, the discounted price is $x - 6.

Step 3: Katie bought 5 roses and 5 daisies. Therefore, she spent a total of 5 * (Price of one rose) + 5 * (Price of one daisy) on her purchase.

Step 4: Let's denote the price of one rose as R and the price of one daisy as D. We can substitute Price of one rose with R and Price of one daisy with D in the total cost equation.

Step 5: Since Katie bought the same number of roses and daisies, we know that the total cost of her roses and daisies is equal. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 5R + 5D = Total Cost

Step 6: To find the total cost, we need to go back to Step 2 where we found that the price of one flower during the sale is $x - 6. In this case, one flower has two parts - one rose and one daisy.

Step 7: Let's denote each part as one unit. Then, a single flower costs (\$x-6)/2 during the sale.

Step 8: Since Katie bought the same number of roses and daisies, we can assume that the number of roses and daisies she bought are both equal to n (where n is an integer). The total number of flowers Katie bought is 2n.

Step 9: Therefore, the total cost of the sale would be 2n * Cost of one flower, or 2n * ((x-6)/2).

Step 10: Simplifying the equation, we have Total Cost = n * x - 3n

Step 11: Since Katie bought an equal number of roses and daisies, and each flower cost $((x-6)/2) during the sale, the Price of one rose and the Price of one daisy are both $((x-6)/2).

Step 12: Substituting the equation from Step 11 into the equation from Step 5 from the total cost, we have 5((x-6)/2) + 5((x-6)/2) = n * x - 3n

Step 13: Simplifying the equation from Step 12, we get 10((x-6)/2) = n * x - 3n

Step 14: Solving for x, we get (10(x-6))/2 = -3n + n * x

Step 15: Cross-multiplying, we get 5x - 30 = 2n^2

Step 16: Solving for n, we get n^2 + (5x/2 - 15)/2 = 0

Step 17: Factoring out the perfect square, we get n^2 + (5x/2 - 15)^2/4 = 0. This is an inconsistent equation since the square of any number is always non-negative. It means that there's no solution for n in this problem, which contradicts the initial assumption that Katie bought an equal number of roses and daisies.

Therefore, the initial assumption was incorrect, and this problem has no valid solution.

Step 3: Adam uses the money earned from selling 11 books to buy 23 new books. To find out how much money Adam earned from selling 11 books, we need to know the price of each book. Let's assume each book sells for $x.
Step 4: The amount of money Adam earned from selling 11 books is 11 * x.
Step 5: The cost of buying 23 new books is 23 * x.
Step 6: We need to find the value of x. To do this, we write the equation: 11x = 23x + 23 * Cost of each new book.
Step 7: Solving for x, we get x = 23. So, the price of each book is $23.
Step 8: Now, we find the number of new books Adam can buy with the money earned from selling 11 books: 11 * $23.
 Step 9: Adam can buy 11 * $23 = $253 worth of new books, or 253 / $23 ≈ 10.91 books, but since Adam can't buy a fraction of a book, he can buy 10 new books.

1. Paul starts with 3 dollars.
2. He receives an additional 7 dollars as allowance.
3. To find out how many 5-dollar toys Paul can buy, we need to determine how much money he has in total after receiving his allowance.
4. Paul starts with 3 dollars and receives 7 dollars, so his total amount of money is 3 + 7 = 10 dollars.
5. Since each 5-dollar toy costs 5 dollars, we can find out how many toys Paul can buy by dividing his total amount of money by the cost of one toy.
6. The number of toys Paul can buy is 10 dollars / 5 dollars = 2 toys.

                 [/INST] Let's walk through this problem step by step:

1. Katie started with 85 files.
2. She deleted 40 files, leaving her with 45 files.
3. She put the rest of the files into folders, with each folder containing 5 files.

Now we want to find out how many folders she ended up with:

1. Each folder contains 5 files.
2. The remaining 45 files are distributed among the folders.
3. To find out how many folders there are, we divide the total number of files before deletion (85) by the number of files in each folder (5), and then subtract the number of files she deleted (40):

{The final answer is (85+40)/5 = 19 folders}

Keep in mind that this answer assumes that Katie was able to evenly distribute the remaining files among the folders. If that's not the case, then the number of folders might be slightly different.</s>",9,9.0,19.0

To find the total number of cupcakes Carol has, we add the number of cupcakes she made initially, the number of cupcakes she sold, and the number of cupcakes she made later.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cupcakes Carol sold.
- She made 19 cupcakes initially.
- She sold 72 cupcakes in dozens.

Total cupcakes Carol sold =Initial cupcakes + Cupcakes sold

Step 2: However, during the game, 7 members didn't show up. So, the number of members who did show up was 14 (total members) - 7 (absent members) = 7 members.

Step 3: Each member who showed up scored 5 points. To find the total number of points scored, we need to multiply the number of members who showed up by the number of points each member scored.

Total points = Members who showed up * Points per member

Step 2: Determine how many books Oliver can put on one shelf.
Oliver can put 4 books on one shelf.

Step 3: Calculate the number of shelves Oliver needs.
To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, we divide the number of books left to put away by the number of books he can put on one shelf.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the number of points Gwen earned.
Gwen recycled 5 pounds of paper. For every 3 pounds she recycled, she earned 1 point. Therefore, the number of points Gwen earned is:

Points for Gwen = Pounds recycled by Gwen (5) ÷ Number of pounds needed for 1 point (3)
Points for Gwen = 5 ÷ 3
Point for Gwen = 1.6667 (approximately)
Since we cannot have a fraction of a point, we will assume that only the whole number part contributes to the score. Therefore, points for Gwen = 1.

Step 2: Identify the number of points her friends earned.
Her friends recycled 13 pounds of paper. Using the same rate as before, the number of points they earned is:

Points for friends = Pounds recycled by friends (13) ÷ Number of pounds needed for 1 point (3)
Points for friends = 13 ÷ 3
Points for friends = 4.3333 (approximately)
Since we cannot have a fraction of a point, we will assume that only the whole number part contributes to the score. Therefore, points for friends = 4.

Step 3: Find the total number of points earned.
Total points = Points for Gwen + Points for friends
Total points = 1 + 4
Total points = 5.

However, since we cannot have half a point, we will assume that only the whole number part of the total contributes to the score. Therefore, the total number of points earned is 5.

                      = 36 pictures

Since Robin sorted the pictures into 9 different albums, and each album should contain the same number of pictures, we can divide the total number of pictures by 9 to find out how many pictures are in each album:

Number of pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
                                            = 36 / 9

Since Maria bought 2 chairs and 2 tables, we have:

1. Number of chairs = 2
2. Time it took to put together one chair = 8 minutes

So, the time it took to put together all the chairs = (Number of chairs) * (Time it took to put together one chair)
=(2) * (8 minutes) = 16 minutes

Similarly, we have:
1. Number of tables = 2
2. Time it took to put together one table = 8 minutes

So, the time it took to put together all the tables = (Number of tables) * (Time it took to put together one table)
=(2) * (8 minutes) = 16 minutes

Now, to find out the total time it took Maria to put together all the furniture, we add the time it took to put together the chairs and the tables:

Total time = Time to put together chairs + Time to put together tables

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find out how many pictures Rachel took during her vacation. She took 6 pictures at the zoo and 9 pictures at the museum, so:
Total pictures taken = Pictures at the zoo + Pictures at the museum
= 6 + 9
= 15

Step 2: Rachel deleted 11 pictures. To find out how many pictures she still has, we need to subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures taken during her vacation:
Pictures still remaining = Total pictures taken - Deleted pictures
= 15 - 11
= 4

                 [/INST] To find out how many baggies Maria can make with the given number of cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in each bag.

First, let's find the total number of cookies Maria has:
Total cookies = Chocolate chip cookies + Oatmeal cookies
Total cookies = 5 + 19
Total cookies = 24

Next, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per bag to find out how many baggies Maria can make:
Number of baggies = Total cookies / Cookies per bag
Number of baggies = 24 / 8

Now, let's perform the division:
Number of baggies = 3

However, since Maria cannot make a fraction of a baggie, she can only make a whole number of baggies. In this case, she can make 3 baggies with the given number of cookies.

Bianca has 5 shelves for mystery books and 4 shelves for picture books.

Step 2: Calculate the number of books on each shelf for mystery books.
Since each shelf for mystery books should have exactly 8 books, the total number of mystery books is:
Number of mystery books = Number of mystery shelves * Books per shelf
Number of mystery books = 5 shelves * 8 books/shelf
Number of mystery books = 40 books

Step 3: Calculate the number of books on each shelf for picture books.
Since each shelf for picture books should have exactly 8 books, the total number of picture books is:
Number of picture books = Number of picture shelves * Books per shelf
Number of picture books = 4 shelves * 8 books/shelf
Number of picture books = 32 books

Step 4: Add the total number of mystery books and picture books to find the overall number of books.

                 [/INST] To find out how many pages John will use in his binder, we first need to determine how many cards each page can hold.since we know that each page can hold 3 cards, now we can find out how many pages are needed for the new cards:

Pages for new cards = Number of new cards / Cards per page
= 8 new cards / 3 cards per page
= 2 pages and 2/3 extra (rounded down as we can't have a fraction of a page)

Next, we will find out how many pages are needed for the old cards:

Pages for old cards = Number of old cards / Cards per page
= 16 old cards / 3 cards per page
= 5 pages and 2/3 extra

Since John can only use whole pages,he can't use the extra cards.So he would need:

Isabel baked 3 brownies, but she needed 5 in total for her party. Therefore, she still needs to bake 2 more brownies.

Step 2: Determine the amount of flour used in one brownie.
Isabel used 5 cups of flour on each brownie.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of flour Isabel has used.
Isabel has baked 3 brownies, so she has used 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 cups of flour.

Step 4: Calculate the amount of flour Isabel still needs.
Isabel needs to make 5 brownies in total. Since 3 brownies have already been made, she needs to make 2 more, so she needs 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 cups of flour.
The total amount of flour Isabel has used and the amount she still needs is 15 cups + 10 cups = <<15+10=25>>25 cups.
