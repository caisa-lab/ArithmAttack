                    question:
                     Paige had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Paige initially had 11 songs on her mp3 player.
Step 2: She deleted 9 old songs from it. So the number of songs remaining on her mp3 player after deleting the old songs is:
Initial number of songs = 11
Number of songs deleted = 9
Remaining songs = Initial number of songs - Number of songs deleted
Remaining songs = 11 - 9
Remaining songs = 2

Step 3: Paige then added 8 new songs to her mp3 player. So the total number of songs she now has on her mp3 player is:
Remaining songs after deleting old songs = 2
Number of new songs added = 8
Total songs = Remaining songs after deleting old songs + Number of new songs added
Total songs = 2 + 8
Total songs = 10

                    question:
                     April's discount flowers was having a sale where each rose was 4 dollars. If April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left, how much money did she earn? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: We start with the number of roses April had at the beginning of the sale, which is 13.
Step 2: We subtract the number of roses she had left at the end of the sale, which is 4.
Step 3: The difference between the initial number of roses and the final number of roses gives us the number of roses she sold.
Step 4: Since each rose was sold for $4, we can multiply the number of roses she sold by the price per rose to find out how much money she earned.

So, the calculation would be:
Number of roses sold = Initial number of roses - Final number of roses
= 13 roses - 4 roses
= 9 roses

Total earnings = Number of roses sold * Price per rose
= 9 roses * $4
= $36

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many shirts Ned had to wash in total: 
9 short sleeve shirts + 21 long sleeve shirts = 30 shirts

Next, we know that Ned only washed 29 shirts before school started. So, to find out how many shirts he did not wash, we simply subtract the number of shirts he did wash from the total number of shirts he had to wash:

30 shirts (total) - 29 shirts (washed) = 1 shirt

                     A company invited 47 people to a luncheon, but 7 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 5 people each, how many tables do they need? 
                 [/INST] To determine how many tables are needed for the luncheon, we first need to find out how many people actually attended. We know that 47 people were invited, but 7 of them didn't show up. So, the number of attendees is:

 attendees = invited people - no-shows
 = 47 - 7
 = 40

Now that we know the number of attendees, we can find out how many tables they need, assuming each table can seat 5 people.

 tables = number of attendees / people per table
 = 40 / 5
 = 8

Since we can't have a fraction of a table, the company would need to use 9 tables to accommodate all the attendees (8 tables for the 40 people and 1 extra table for the unused seat).

{The final answer is: The company needs 9 tables.}</s>",8,8.0,9.0

                     Tom had 5 books. If he sold 4 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Tom have? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Tom initially had 5 books.

Step 2: Tom sold 4 books, so he no longer has those 4 books.

Step 3: Tom earned money from selling those 4 books. The amount of money isn't given in the problem, but we can calculate the number of books he bought with that money.

Step 4: Tom used the money he earned to buy 38 new books.

Step 5: To find the total number of books Tom has now, we must find the initial number of books (5) and add the number of new books he bought (38).

{The final answer is: Tom has 5 (initial books) + 38 (new books) = 43 books}

So, Tom has a total of 43 books.</s>",39,39.0,43.0

                    question:
                     For a birthday party Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 9 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Jerry's fridge would fill up, we first need to determine the total number of sodas he bought and then divide that number by the number of sodas that can be stored on each shelf.

Step 1: Determine the total number of sodas Jerry bought.
Regular sodas = 41
Diet sodas = 22
Total number of sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
Total number of sodas = 41 + 22
Total number of sodas = 63

Step 2: Divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can be stored on each shelf to find the number of shelves needed.
Number of shelves = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
Number of shelves = 63 / 9
Number of shelves = 7

However, since you can't have a fraction of a shelf, Jerry would need to fill up 8 shelves entirely and have 1 sodas left over. To accommodate this last soda, Jerry could use an extra shelf that can store only a few sodas or find another way to store the last one.

So, the final answer is: Jerry would need to fill up 8 shelves for his sodas (9 shelves in total). {However, he may need to find a way to store the last remaining soda.}</s>",7,7.0,9.0

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many pieces of candy Debby and her sister had together before they ate any. We know Debby had 32 pieces and her sister had 42, so:

Total candy before eating = Debby's candy + Sister's candy
Total candy before eating = 32 + 42
Total candy before eating = 74

Next, they ate 35 pieces the first night. So, we need to find out how many pieces they have left:

Remaining candy = Total candy before eating - Pieces eaten
Remaining candy = 74 - 35
Remaining candy = 39

                 [/INST] To solve this problem, let's find out how many seeds Emily used up in the big garden, and then subtract that number from her initial seed count to find out how many seeds she used in the small gardens.

1. Emily planted 29 seeds in the big garden.
2. She put 4 seeds in each small garden.
3. So, the number of seeds in one small garden is 4.
4. To find out how many small gardens Emily has, we divide the number of seeds she used in the small gardens by the number of seeds in one small garden.
5. Since Emily used 41 seeds initially, and she used 29 seeds in the big garden, then the number of seeds she used in the small gardens is: 41 (total seeds) - 29 (big garden) = 12 seeds.
6. Therefore, the number of small gardens Emily has is: 12 (total seeds in small gardens) / 4 (seeds per small garden) = 3 gardens.

                 [/INST] To find out how long the candy will last Emily if she eats 9 pieces a day, we first need to find out how many pieces of candy she has in total.

Step 1: Find the number of candies Emily received from neighbors and her older sister.
She received 5 pieces from neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister, so she has a total of 5 + 13 = <ins>18</ins> pieces of candy.

Step 2: Find out how long her candy will last if she eats 9 pieces a day.
To find this out, we divide the total number of pieces of candy by the number of pieces she eats a day: 
18 pieces / 9 pieces a day = 2 days

So, if Emily eats only 9 pieces of candy a day, her candy will last for 2 days. {The final answer is: The candy will last for 2 days}</s>",2,2.0,2.0

                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Mike will need, we first need to determine how many books he has left to put away:

1. The total number of books is 82.
2. The librarian took 10 books, leaving Mike with:
   82 (total books) - 10 (books taken by the librarian) = 72 books

Now, we need to find out how many books can fit on one shelf. We're told Mike can fit 9 books on a shelf.

So, the number of books per shelf is 9.

To find out how many shelves Mike needs, we divide the total number of books he has left by the number of books that can fit on one shelf:

1. The total number of books Mike has left is 72.
2. One shelf can hold 9 books.
3. So, to find out how many shelves Mike needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books that can fit on one shelf:
   72 (total books) / 9 (books per shelf) ≈ 8

Since Mike can't have a fraction of a shelf, he will need to round up and get 9 shelves.

Total number of pictures = Pictures at the zoo + Pictures at the museum
Total number of pictures = 49 + 8
Total number of pictures = 57

Step 2: Nancy deleted 38 pictures. To find out how many pictures she still has, we need to subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures taken:

                     A group of 4 friends went into a restaurant. The chef already had 9 chicken wings cooked but cooked 7 more for the group. If they each got the same amount how many would each person get? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many chicken wings each person got, we first need to find out how many chicken wings the chef cooked in total for the group of 4 friends.

The chef had 9 chicken wings cooked before the group arrived, and then he cooked 7 more. So, the total number of chicken wings the chef cooked is:

Total chicken wings = Cooked before + Cooked for group
= 9 + 7
= 16

Since there are 4 friends in the group, we can find out how many chicken wings each person got by dividing the total number of wings by the number of people:

Number of wings per person = Total chicken wings / Number of people
= 16 / 4
= 4

                 [/INST] Let's think through this step by step:

1. First, let's find out how many bears the toy store has in total after receiving the new shipment.
   Total number of bears = Initial number of bears + Number of bears in the shipment
   = 17 + 10 = 27 bears

2. Next, we want to find out how many bears can fit on one shelf.
   Number of bears per shelf = 9

3. Finally, we need to determine how many shelves the store used to display all the bears.
   Number of shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears per shelf
   = 27 / 9 = 3

   However, since they can't put a whole bear on a shelf (bears are not that small), they must have arranged multiple bears on each shelf. 

4. To check if they could fit all 27 bears with 9 bears per shelf, let's calculate the maximum number of shelves they could have and see if it's enough.
    max_shelves = Total number of bears / Number of bears per shelf
    = 27 / 9

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many books are on each mystery shelf and each picture shelf. Since each shelf must have exactly 4 books, we can find the number of books for one shelf of each type, and then multiply that by the number of shelves.

Number of books on one mystery shelf = 4 books
Number of books on one picture shelf = 4 books

Step 2: Find out how many books are on all the mystery shelves.
Number of mystery shelves = 5

Total number of books on mystery shelves = Number of books on one mystery shelf * Number of mystery shelves
Total number of books on mystery shelves = 4 * 5 = 20 books

Step 3: Find out how many books are on all the picture shelves.
Number of picture shelves = 3

Total number of books on picture shelves = Number of books on one picture shelf * Number of picture shelves
Total number of books on picture shelves = 4 * 3 = 12 books

Step 4: Add the total number of books on mystery shelves and picture shelves to find the total number of books.

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups the debate team can make with a total of 5 boys and 40 girls when they are all arranged in groups of 9, we need to calculate the number of groups first for boys and then for the girls, and then take the larger number as the final answer since all members from both genders must be included in each group.

Step 1: Calculate the number of groups for boys:
Number of groups (boys) = Total number of boys / Group size
Number of groups (boys) = 5 / 9

Step 2: Finding the number of groups for boys as a decimal:
Number of groups (boys) = 5 / 9 ≈ 0.556

Step 3: Rounding up to the nearest whole number since we can't have a fraction of a group (group size must be met):
Number of groups (boys) = 1

Step 4: Calculate the number of groups for girls:
Number of groups (girls) = Total number of girls / Group size
Number of groups (girls) = 40 / 9

Step 5: Finding the number of groups for girls as a decimal:

                 [/INST] To find out how much money April earned during the sale, we first need to determine how many roses she bought and sold. We know that she started with 9 roses and had 4 roses left.

Step 1: Find out how many roses April bought during the sale.
April started with 9 roses and had 4 roses left. So, she must have bought 5 more roses during the sale (9 started + 4 left = 13 total roses - 9 starting roses = 5 roses bought).

Step 2: Determine how much money April spent on roses.
Each rose was sold for $7, and she bought 5 roses. So, she spent a total of $35 on roses during the sale (5 roses * $7/rose = $35).

Step 3: Find out how much money April earned.
To find her earnings, we need to subtract her spending from the total money she received for the roses she sold. Since she started with 9 roses and had 4 left, then her total number of roses sold was 5. Therefore, her total earnings were 5 roses * $7/rose = $35. However, she spent $35 on buying roses as well. To find the net earnings, we need to subtract the money she spent on buying roses from her total earnings. So, her net earnings are $0.

                 [/INST] To find out how many cats the pet store has left after selling 10 cats, we first need to determine how many of each type of cat were sold. Let's assume that all types of cats were sold equally during the sale.

Step 1: Find out how many siamese cats and house cats were sold.
Since there were 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats initially, and 10 cats were sold in total, we can calculate the number of each type of cat sold as follows:

Number of siamese cats sold = Number of house cats sold = Number of cats sold / 2
Number of cats sold = 13 (siamese) + 5 (house) + 10 (sold) = 28
Number of siamese cats sold = 28 / 2 = 14
Number of house cats sold = 14

Step 2: Subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of cats for each type.
Number of siamese cats left = 13 (initial) - 14 (sold) = -1
Number of house cats left = 5 (initial) - 14 (sold) = -9 (this result is not possible, it means that the number of house cats sold was more than the initial number, so the assumption that all types of cats were sold equally during the sale is not correct)

Since we reached an inconsistent result when assuming that all types of cats were sold equally during the sale, it's likely that the store sold more siamese cats than house cats during the sale. Without knowing the exact number of siamese cats sold, we cannot determine the final number of cats left at the store.

Therefore, we cannot provide a clear final answer to this problem.</s>",8,8.0,9.0

                    question:
                     Megan baked 71 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 43 of them how many packages could she make if she put 7 cupcake in each package? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many cupcakes Megan has left after her brother ate 43 of them.
Megan baked 71 cupcakes. Todd ate 43 of them, so Megan is left with: 71 (Megan's initial number of cupcakes) – 43 (number of cupcakes Todd ate) = 28 cupcakes.

Step 2: Calculate how many packages Megan can make with the remaining cupcakes.
Number of packages = Number of cupcakes / Cupcakes per package
 = 28 / 7
 = 4 packages with a remainder of 2 cupcakes.

Since Megan can't easily sell leftover cupcakes as a full package, she could consider making a fifth smaller package with the remaining cupcakes or giving them away as treats.

                 [/INST] To find out how many lives the 4 friends had in total, we first need to find out how many lives each friend had individually and then add their lives together.

1. Each friend had 6 lives, so there were 6 lives for the first two friends.
2. Two more players joined the game, meaning two more friends, and each of them also had 6 lives.
3. Therefore, the 2 new friends had 6 lives each, which equals 12 lives in total for the new friends.

Now, to find out how many lives all 4 friends had in total, add the number of lives the first two friends had to the number of lives the new two friends had:

4. First two friends: 6 lives x 2 friends = 12 lives
5. New two friends: 12 lives

So, the total number of lives for the 4 friends is:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many bouquets Wendy made with the flowers that didn't wilt.
- We know that Wendy picked 103 flowers and made bouquets with 8 flowers in each one.
- First, let's see how many bouquets were made without considering the wilted flowers: Bouquet count = Total picked flowers / Flowers per bouquet = 103 / 8 = 13.125
- Since she can't make a fraction of a bouquet, we'll assume she made 13 bouquets initially.

Step 2: Determine how many bouquets can still be made with the fresh flowers.
- Wendy had picked 103 flowers initially and 47 wilted, so she had 56 fresh flowers left.
- Now calculate how many bouquets can be made with the remaining fresh flowers: Bouquet count = Fresh flowers / Flowers per bouquet = 56 / 8 = 7

                 [/INST] To find out how many vans are needed for Nancy's class to go on the field trip, we first need to determine how many people will be attending in total.We have 12 students, so that's 12 people. We also have 3 adults, so add 3 more for them.
Total number of people = Students + Adults
Total number of people = 12 + 3
Total number of people = 15
Now that we know the total number of people, we can determine how many vans they will need by dividing the total number of people by the number of people each van can hold.
Number of vans = Total number of people / People per van
Number of vans = 15 / 5
Number of vans = 3
However, since each van can only carry a whole number of people, they would need to round up. Therefore, they would need to book 4 vans to ensure everyone can attend the field trip.

                     For a birthday party Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 7 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Tom would need to fill up, we first need to determine how many sodas he bought in total and then calculate how many sodas can be stored on each shelf.

Total number of sodas Tom bought = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
= 4 + 52
= 56

Number of sodas per shelf = Regular sodas per shelf + Diet sodas per shelf
= 7 + 7
= 14 {Since each shelf can hold 7 regular sodas and 7 diet sodas}

Number of shelves Tom needs = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
= 56 / 14
= 4 {Since Tom can't have a fraction of a shelf}

However, we made an error in our calculation for the number of sodas per shelf. Actually, since Tom bought 52 diet sodas, each shelf would hold 7 regular sodas + 7 diet sodas = 14 regular-diet sodas in total. Thus, the number of shelves Tom needs is:

Number of shelves Tom needs = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
= 56 / 14
≈ 4.07 {Since Tom can't have a fraction of a shelf}

To accommodate all of his sodas, Tom would need to find a larger fridge or find a way to store some of his sodas elsewhere.

Step 2: They used 20 apples to make lunch for the students, so we subtract those apples from the original amount: 38 apples (initial) - 20 apples (used) = <<38-20=18>>18 apples remaining.

Step 3: They bought an additional 28 apples. So we add those apples to the remaining amount: 18 apples (remaining) + 28 apples (bought) = <<18+28=46>>46 apples in total.

                 [/INST] To find the number of trips Luke makes, we need to calculate how many sets of trays he can pick up from each table and then find the number of trips required for each table. We'll solve this problem in two steps.

Step 1: Find out how many sets of trays Luke can pick up from each table.
- Luke can carry 4 trays at a time.
- From Table 1, he can pick up 4 sets of 20 trays (since 4 goes into 20 twice with a remainder of 0). So, this table requires 4 trips.
- From Table 2, he can pick up 4 sets of 16 trays (since 4 goes into 16 once with a remainder of 0). So, this table requires 4 trips as well.

Step 2: Find the total number of trips Luke makes.
Since Luke makes the same number of trips from each table, we simply add the number of trips from both tables:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many apples are left after distributing them to students.
96 apples (total) -> 42 apples (given to students)

Step 2: Subtract the number of apples given to students from the total number of apples to find out how many apples are left for making pies.
96 apples (total) -> 42 apples (given to students) -> 54 apples (remaining)

Step 3: Determine how many pies can be made with the remaining apples, assuming each pie uses 6 apples.
54 apples (remaining) -> number of pies = apples / apples per pie

Step 4: Perform the calculation.

                     For Halloween Bianca received 78 pieces of candy. She ate 30 pieces then placed the rest into piles with 8 in each pile. How many piles could she make? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many piles Bianca could make with the remaining candies after eating 30 pieces, we first need to determine how many candies are left.

Step 1: Subtract the number of candies Bianca ate from the total number of candies she received.
Total candies Bianca received = 78
Candies Bianca ate = 30

Difference = Total candies - Candies eaten
Difference = 78 - 30
Difference = 48

So, Bianca has 48 candies left.

Step 2: Divide the number of remaining candies by the number of candies she plans to put in each pile.
Number of candies in each pile = 8
Number of piles = Total candies / Candies per pile

Calculation = 48 / 8

To perform the division, we need to find the quotient and the remainder:

Quotient = 6
Remainder = 0

So, there are no remainders, which means all 48 candies can be put into 6 piles, each with 8 candies.

In the end, Bianca can make {6} piles with the remaining candies.</s>",6,6.0,6.0

                 [/INST] Step 1: We have 5 friends playing the video game. Each friend has 8 lives. So the total number of lives for the initial group is:
Total lives for 5 friends = Number of friends * Lives per friend
= 5 * 8
= 40 lives

Step 2: Two more players join the game, increasing the total number of players by 2. This means there are now (5 + 2) = 7 friends in the game.

Step 3: The number of lives for each of the 7 friends remains the same, being 8 lives each.

Step 4: To find the total number of lives for all players now, we calculate:
Total lives for all players = Number of players * Lives per player
= 7 * 8

                 [/INST] To find out how many books Roger has after selling some and buying new ones, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Roger started with 25 books.
2. He sold 21 books, so we need to find out how many books he has left after that.
3. Subtract the number of books he sold from the initial number of books he had: 25 - 21 = {3}
   So, Roger had 3 books left after selling 21.
4. Next, he used the money he earned from selling the books to buy 30 new books.
5. We don't have specific information about how many books he earned from selling the 21 books. Let's assume that for simplicity, we'll say he earned exactly enough money to buy 30 new books. In this case, we can just add the number of new books he bought to the number of books he had left to find the final number.
6. Sum the remaining 3 books with the new 30 books: 3 + 30 = {33}

The final answer is: Roger has 33 books. However, this is an assumption made because we don't have enough information about how many books Roger actually earned from selling his old books.

1. Total number of players = 48 (new players) + 6 (returning players) = 54
2. Number of players in each group = 6

Now we can calculate the number of groups:

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many files are left on Nancy's computer after she deleted 31 files.

Number of files after deletion = Initial number of files - Number of deleted files
= 80 files - 31 files
= 49 files

Next, we'll divide the remaining files by the number of files per folder to find out how many folders Nancy created.

Number of folders = Number of remaining files / Number of files per folder
= 49 files / 7 files per folder
≈ 7 folders

However, since Nancy can't create a fraction of a folder, she'd have to create at least 8 folders (one for each group of 7 files and an additional one to accommodate the remaining files). To find the exact number of folders, we'll calculate the quotient and then add 1.

Number of folders = Quotient of number of remaining files by number of files per folder + 1
= 7 folders + 1
= 8 folders

So, the final answer is that Nancy ended up with 8 folders on her computer.</s>",7,7.0,8.0

Step 1: Luke started with 39 games, and he sold 19 of them. So, the number of games Luke had left is:
39 (total games) - 19 (games sold) = 20 games

Step 2: Luke packed the remaining games into boxes, putting 4 games into each box. To find out how many boxes he used, we divide the number of games he had left by the number of games per box:
20 (remaining games) / 4 (games per box) = 5 boxes (rounded up)

                 [/INST] Let's go through this problem step by step:

1. We know that Will initially had 59 pieces of clothing to wash.
2. He put 32 pieces in one load, so the number of pieces in one large load is 32.
3. He decided to split the remaining clothing into 9 equal loads. Let x be the number of pieces in one small load.
4. We know that the number of pieces in one large load plus the number of pieces in 9 small loads is equal to the total number of pieces Will had. That is, 32 (large load) + 9x (small loads) = 59.
5. Solving this equation for x, we get x = (59 - 32) / 9 ≈ 6.5. Since we cannot have a fraction of a piece of clothing, we need to round this number up or down. Rounding down would give us 6 pieces in each small load, leaving behind 1 piece of clothing. Rounding up would give us 7 pieces in each small load, allowing us to wash all 59 pieces of clothing.
6. To find the final answer, we can choose either 6 or 7 pieces of clothing per small load, depending on whether we want to leave behind some pieces or not. However, since the problem does not indicate a preference for avoiding leftover pieces, we will choose the option that allows us to wash all pieces: {The final answer is: Will can put 7 pieces of clothing in each small load.}</s>",3,3.0,7.0

                 [/INST] To find out how much Katie spent on roses and daisies during the sale at April's Discount Flowers, we need to calculate the cost of each type of flower separately and then add them together.

1. Cost of roses: Katie bought 5 roses, and each rose cost $6.
   Cost of roses = Number of roses * Cost per rose
               = 5 roses * $6/rose
               = $30

2. Cost of daisies: Katie bought 5 daisies, and each daisy cost $6.
   Cost of daisies = Number of daisies * Cost per daisy
                 = 5 daisies * $6/daisy
                 = $30

3. Total amount spent: Cost of roses + Cost of daisies
                 = $30 + $30

                     Adam had 33 books. If he sold 11 of them and used the money he earned to buy 23 new books, how many books would Adam have? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: We start with the number of books Adam originally had, which is 33.

Step 2: Next, we subtract the number of books Adam sold, which is 11.

Adam's books after selling = Original number of books - Number of books sold
Adam's books after selling = 33 - 11

Step 3: We find the answer for the number of books Adam has after selling:

Adam's books after selling = 22

Step 4: Now, let's find out how many books Adam bought with the money earned from selling the 11 books.

Money from selling books = Money spent on new books
We don't have the exact amount Adam received from selling the books or the price of each new book. For the purpose of this example, let's assume the selling price of each book was $5, and so Adam earned 11 * $5 = $<<55>>55.

Step 5: Since Adam bought 23 new books, we can find the cost of one new book:

Cost of one new book = Total money spent on new books / Number of new books
Cost of one new book = $55 / 23

Step 6: Finally, with the cost of one new book, we can determine the total number of new books Adam has:

New books = Total money spent on new books / Cost of one new book
New books = $55 / ($55 / 23)

Step 7: We can simplify the above expression to find the final number of books Adam has.

New books = 23

Step 8: To get the total number of books Adam now has, add the books he has after selling to the books he bought:

Total number of books = Adam's books after selling + New books
Total number of books = 22 + 23

Step 2: However, during the game, 2 members didn't show up, so the number of members who did show up was 5 (total team members) - 2 (absent members) = 3.

Step 3: Each member who did show up scored 6 points, so to find the total number of points scored, we simply multiply the number of members who showed up by the number of points each member scored: 3 members * 6 points/member = 18 points.

                     Oliver is at the library helping put away books. There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Oliver will need, we first need to determine how many books he has left to put away after the librarian took 10.

1. We know there were originally 46 books.
2. The librarian took 10, leaving Oliver with 36 books.

{The number of books Oliver has left to put away is 36}.

Next, we need to calculate how many books can be put on each shelf:

1. We know that Oliver can fit 4 books on one shelf.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the total number of books he has left by the number of books that can fit on one shelf:

{Shelves needed = Total number of books / Number of books per shelf}

{Shelves needed = 36 / 4}

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 4:

{Shelves needed = 9}

However, since Oliver cannot have a fraction of a shelf, he will need to round up to ensure all the books have a place. Therefore, he will need 10 shelves in total.

{The final answer is: Oliver will need 10 shelves to put away the remaining 36 books.}</s>",9,9.0,36.0

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Luke has 5 piles of quarters and each pile contains 3 quarters. So the number of quarters he has is:
3 (coins in each pile) * 5 (number of piles) = 15 quarters.

Step 2: Similarly, he has 5 piles of dimes and each pile contains 3 dimes. So the number of dimes he has is:
3 (coins in each pile) * 5 (number of piles) = 15 dimes.

Step 3: To find the total number of coins Luke has, we simply add the number of quarters and dimes together:
Total number of coins = Quarters + Dimes
= 15 quarters + 15 dimes
= 15 * (quarters + dimes) / 1
= 15 * (2) / 1
= 30.

                 [/INST] To find the number of pictures in each album, we first need to determine the total number of pictures Robin uploaded and then divide that number by the number of albums she wants to create.

Total number of pictures uploaded = Pictures from phone + Pictures from camera
Total number of pictures = 31 (from phone) + 5 (from camera) = 36

Since she wants to divide her pictures equally among 9 albums, we can find the number of pictures in each album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

Number of pictures in each album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums
Number of pictures in each album = 36 / 9

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

Number of pictures in each album = (36 ÷ 3) / (9 ÷ 3) = 12 / 3

So, we cannot directly divide by a fraction, we'll multiply by its reciprocal instead, which is 3/1.

Number of pictures in each album = 12 ÷ 3 * 3/1 = 12

Therefore, the number of pictures in each album is 12.

First, we'll find out how long it took for Maria to put together the chairs. Since she bought 2 new chairs, and it took her 8 minutes to put one chair together, we can calculate the total time for putting together all the chairs as:

Time for chairs = Number of chairs × Time per chair
= 2 × 8
= 16 minutes

Next, we'll find out how long it took for Maria to put together the tables. Again, since she bought 2 new tables, and it took her 8 minutes to put one table together, we can calculate the total time for putting together all the tables as:

Time for tables = Number of tables × Time per table
= 2 × 8
= 16 minutes

To find the total time it took for Maria to finish assembling the furniture, we add the time for chairs and the time for tables:

Total time = Time for chairs + Time for tables

                     Maria was making baggies of cookies with 8 cookies in each bag. If she had 5 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many baggies Maria can make with the given number of cookies, we need to find out how many sets of 8 cookies (one baggie) she has in total.

First, let's find out how many baggies she can make with the chocolate chip cookies:
1. Maria has 5 chocolate chip cookies.
2. Each baggie contains 8 cookies.
3. To find out how many baggies she can make with the chocolate chip cookies, divide the number of chocolate chip cookies by the number of cookies per baggie:
   Baggages_choc = Cookies_choc / Cookies_per_bag
   Baggages_choc = 5 / 8

To make a clean calculation, we prefer to work with whole numbers. Since 5 cannot be divided evenly by 8, it means we cannot make a full baggie with the chocolate chip cookies alone. In this situation, we consider that one baggie is made and the remaining cookies will be added to a subsequent baggie. Therefore, the number of baggages made with the chocolate chip cookies is 1 plus the quotient of the chocolate chip cookies divided by the cookies per baggie.

   Baggages_choc = 1 + 5/8
   Baggages_choc = 1 + 0.625
   Baggages_choc ≈ 1.625
   Since we can only make a whole number of baggages, we must round up and make 2 baggages with the chocolate chip cookies.

Next, let's find out how many baggages she can make with the oatmeal cookies:
1. Maria has 19 oatmeal cookies.
2. Each baggie contains 8 cookies.
3. To find out how many baggages she can make with the oatmeal cookies, divide the number of oatmeal cookies by the number of cookies per baggie:
   Baggages_oat = Cookies_oat / Cookies_per_bag
   Baggages_oat = 19 / 8

Since we can still make a full baggie with the oatmeal cookies, we can make 2.5 baggages. However, since we can only make whole baggages, we need to add 1 more baggie to include all the oatmeal cookies.

The final answer is: Maria can make 3 baggies in total (2 baggies with the chocolate chip cookies and 1 baggie with the remaining oatmeal cookies).</s>",3,3.0,1.0

Since there are 3 cards per page, we have:

{One page can hold 3 cards}

Now, let's calculate how many pages are required to store all the new and old cards:

For the new cards:
Number of pages = Total number of new cards / Cards per page
= (8 new cards) / (3 cards per page)
= 3 pages

For the old cards:
Number of pages = Total number of old cards / Cards per page
= (16 old cards) / (3 cards per page)

Step 1: Find the number of points Bianca earned.
Bianca recycled 24 pounds, and for every 3 pounds, she earned one point. So, we divide the number of pounds that Bianca recycled by the number of pounds required to earn one point:

Number of points for Bianca = Pounds recycled by Bianca / Pounds required for one point
Number of points for Bianca = 24 pounds / 3 pounds per point

Number of points for Bianca = 8

Step 2: Find the number of points her friends earned.
Her friends recycled 3 pounds, and the rate is still one point per 3 pounds. So, we calculate the number of points they earned in the same way:

Number of points for Bianca's friends = Pounds recycled by Bianca's friends / Pounds required for one point
Number of points for Bianca's friends = 3 pounds / 3 pounds per point

Number of points for Bianca's friends = 1

Step 3: Find the total number of points earned by Bianca and her friends.

Total number of wings = chickens wings chef had + wings cooked for the group
Total number of wings = 8 (cooked beforehand) + 10 (cooked for the group) = 18

Number of wings per person = Total number of wings / Number of people
Number of wings per person = 18 / 3

Step 2: To find the number of wings each person got, we divide the total number of wings by the number of people in the group.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes the painter to paint the remaining 4 rooms, we first need to determine how long it took him to paint the 2 rooms he has already completed. We know that each room takes 5 hours to paint, so:

Time to paint 2 rooms = 2 rooms * 5 hours/room
= 10 hours

Now, to find out how long it will take him to paint the remaining 4 rooms, we can use the same formula:

Time to paint 4 rooms = 4 rooms * 5 hours/room
= 20 hours

However, since he has already painted 2 rooms and spent 10 hours doing so, we need to add the time it will take to paint the remaining rooms to the time he has already spent:

Total time = Time to paint remaining rooms + Time already spent
= 20 hours + 10 hours

Step 1: Find the number of customers at the remaining tables
Customers at the remaining tables = Total customers - Customers who left
= 22 - 14
= 8

Step 2: Determine the number of tables with this number of customers
Since each table had 4 people, we can divide the number of customers at the remaining tables by the number of people per table:

Number of tables = Customers at the remaining tables / People per table
= 8 / 4
= 2 tables with 4 people each OR

                 [/INST] To find out how many pieces of clothing can go in each of the small loads, we first need to find out how many pieces of clothing are in the larger load that Roger did not split up.

1. We know that Roger put 48 pieces of clothing in one load.
2. The remaining clothing were split into 9 equal loads.
3. So, the number of pieces of clothing in each small load is the total number of remaining clothing divided by the number of small loads.

Let's calculate that:
Total number of clothing = 120
Number of pieces of clothing in the large load = 48
Number of small loads = 9

First, let's find out how many pieces of clothing are in the large load that Roger did not wash:

Total number of clothing = Number of pieces in large load + Number of pieces in small loads
120 = 48 + Number of pieces in small loads * 9

Solving for the number of pieces in small loads:
Number of pieces in small loads = (Total number of clothing - Number of pieces in large load) / Number of small loads
Number of pieces in small loads = (120 - 48) / 9
Number of pieces in small loads = 32

Therefore, each small load can contain 32 pieces of clothing.

                 [/INST] To find out how many students were in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to find the net change in the number of students. First, let's determine how many students left:

1. Students who left = 10 (initial number of students) - 4 (who left during the year)

Next, let's determine how many new students joined fourth grade:

2. New students = 42

Now, we can calculate the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year:

3. Students at the end of the year = Students who left + New students

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many books Roger is left with after the librarian takes 2.
We know that there are originally 14 books and 2 are taken away, so Roger is left with:

14 total books - 2 taken away = 12 books

Step 2: Determine how many books can fit on one shelf.
We're told that Roger can fit 3 books on a shelf.

                    question:
                     For a birthday party Cody bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 6 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many shelves Cody would need to fill up, we first need to determine how many sodas he bought in total. we know that Cody bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas.

Total number of sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
= 4 + 44
= 48

Now, we know that each shelf in Cody's fridge can hold 6 sodas. So, to find out how many shelves he would need, we need to divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.

Number of shelves = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
= 48 / 6

Since we cannot have a decimal number of shelves, we need to find the quotient of this division and round up if the quotient is less than the actual number of sodas. Thereby, the calculation is as follows:

Quotient =Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
= 48 / 6
= 8 with a remainder of 0

Therefore, Cody would need to fill up 8 shelves in his fridge to accommodate all the sodas he bought.

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups the schools debate team can make when splitting into groups of 9, we first need to find out how many people are in total and then divide that number by the group size.

Step 1: Find the total number of people in the debate team
Total number of people = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of people = 26 boys + 46 girls
Total number of people = 72

Step 2: Calculate how many groups can be made
Number of groups = Total number of people / Group size
Number of groups = 72 / 9

Step 3: Calculate the quotient and remainder
We can calculate the quotient and remainder using long division or by using the division symbol: /. In this case, we'll use the division symbol.

Number of groups = 8 remainder 0

Step 4: The final answer
Since there is no remainder in our calculation, it means that the debate team can be split into exactly 8 groups of 9 people each.

                 [/INST] To find out how many people would be on each team, we first need to determine the total number of people who made up the volleyball teams.

Total number of people = Managers + Employees
Total number of people = 9 managers * 1 person per manager + 15 employees * 1 person per employee
Total number of people = 9 + 15 = 24 people

Since we're forming 8 teams, the number of people on each team is calculated by:

Number of people per team = Total number of people / Number of teams
Number of people per team = 24 people / 8 teams
Number of people per team = 3 people

So,

1. For the first table, Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time. So, the number of trips required for this table is the total number of trays divided by the number of trays Jerry can carry in one trip.

Number of trips from Table 1 = Total number of trays on Table 1 / Number of trays Jerry can carry in one trip
Number of trips from Table 1 = 9 trays / 8 trays per trip
Number of trips from Table 1 = 1 with 1 tray left over
In this scenario, we have an extra tray that Jerry could carry on the way back to the table after dropping off the initial 8 trays, so no additional trip is needed for this table.

2. For the second table, Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time. So, the number of trips required for this table is the total number of trays divided by the number of trays Jerry can carry in one trip.

Number of trips from Table 2 = Total number of trays on Table 2 / Number of trays Jerry can carry in one trip
Number of trips from Table 2 = 7 trays / 8 trays per trip
Number of trips from Table 2 = 1 more than 1 tray per trip (i.e., 1 full load + 1 tray)

3. Since Jerry made an additional trip to Table 1 in the previous step, the total number of trips Jerry makes is the sum of the trips taken to both tables.

Total number of trips = Number of trips to Table 1 + Number of trips to Table 2

However, we made an error in the calculation above. We assumed the number of files per folder is exactly 5. But the question states that Wendy put the rest of the files into folders with 5 files ""in each one."" This means the number of files in each folder is an exact multiple of 5. Given that Wendy had 45 remaining files which is not an exact multiple of 5, the only possibility for this to work out is that there is an additional empty folder that makes up the difference. Therefore, we need to add 1 empty folder to make the number divide evenly.

Step 3: So, Wendy ended up with a total of 10 folders (9 folders with 5 files each and 1 empty folder).

                     There school's baseball team had 12 new players and 44 returning players. If the coach put them into groups with 8 players in each group, how many groups would there be? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many groups there would be with 8 players in each group, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.

First, let's find the total number of players:
Total players = New players + Returning players
Total players = 12 + 44
Total players = 56

Now, let's find out how many groups there would be with 56 players and each group having 8 players:

Groups = Total players / Players per group
Groups = 56 / 8

We cannot directly divide by 8, so we'll need to perform some calculations to find the quotient and the remainder:
1) Quotient: Divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.
Groups = 56 / 8
Groups = 7 with a remainder of 4 (we'll call this ""remainder A"")

2) Find the number of full groups from the quotient:
Full groups = Quotient
Full groups = 7

3) Determine the number of remaining players and create the last group with them:
Remaining players = Remainder A
Remaining players = 4

Now we can add the number of full groups to the number of remaining groups to find the total number of groups:

Total groups = Full groups + Remaining groups
Total groups = 7 + 1
Total groups = 8

1. Will made 104 dollars mowing lawns over the summer.
2. He spent 41 dollars on mower blades.

To find Will's total earnings and the amount of money he had left:

Total earnings = Amount made mowing lawns
Total earnings = $104

First, let's find out how many items (scarves andmittens) are in each box:

1 box = 5 scarves + 5 mittens = 5 scarves + 5 mittens = 10 items

Next, we need to find out how many total items (scarves and mittens) are in all 6 boxes:

Total items = Number of boxes * Items per box
Total items = 6 boxes * 10 items/box

Calculate that:

Total items = 6 * 10

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the time it took to cook the first 6 potatoes.
Since each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, it took the chef 6 minutes * 6 potatoes = <6*6=36>36 minutes to cook the first 6 potatoes.

Step 2: Determine how long it takes to cook the remaining 6 potatoes.
It will take the same amount of time to cook each potato, so it will take 6 minutes * 6 potatoes = <6*6=36>36 minutes to cook the remaining 6 potatoes.

Step 3: Add the time it took to cook the first 6 potatoes to the time it will take to cook the remaining 6 potatoes to find the total time needed.

                 [/INST] To find out how many boxes Luke used, we first need to determine how many games he had left after selling 39.

Step 1: Find the number of games Luke had left after selling 39.
Luke started with 57 games and sold 39 of them. So, the number of games he had left is:

57 (initial number of games) - 39 (number of games sold) = 18 games

Step 2: Determine how many games each box can hold.
Each box can hold 2 games.

Step 3: Find out how many boxes Luke needs to use.
To find the number of boxes, we need to divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold.

Number of boxes = Number of remaining games / Number of games per box
Number of boxes = 18 games / 2 games per box = 9 boxes

However, since each box can hold exactly 2 games, Luke will actually need 10 boxes to accommodate all 18 games, as each box holds 2 games, and an additional box for the remaining 2 games that cannot be placed into another box.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many games Ned bought from each place.
Ned bought 50 games from a friend, so the number of games he bought at the garage sale is 50 + 27 = <<50+27=77>>77

Step 2: Determine how many games didn't work.
Ned said that 74 of the games didn't work. So, the number of good games out of the games he bought from his friend is 50 - 74 (since 74 didn't work), which is a negative number, meaning he had a net loss with those games.
However, the number of good games out of the games he bought at the garage sale is 77 (the total number of games he bought there) - 74 (the number of broken games).

Step 3: Find the total number of good games Ned has.
Since the number of good games from his friend is negative, we cannot include that in the calculation of the total number of good games. Instead, we'll only consider the good games from the garage sale. We have: good games from garage sale = 77 - 74 = <<77-74=4>>4

Step 2: Each box contains 3 pieces of candy. So, the total number of pieces that Dave originally had is:

 number of pieces = number of boxes * pieces per box
 = 12 boxes * 3 pieces/box
 = 36 pieces

Step 3: Dave gave 5 boxes to his little brother.

Step 4: Since each box contains 3 pieces, the number of pieces that Dave gave away is:

 pieces given away = number of boxes given away * pieces per box
 = 5 boxes * 3 pieces/box
 = 15 pieces

Step 5: To find the number of pieces that Dave still has, we subtract the number of pieces he gave away from the original number of pieces:

 pieces left = original number of pieces - pieces given away
 = 36 pieces - 15 pieces
 = 21 pieces

{The final answer is: Dave still had 21 pieces of chocolate candy.}</s>",21,21.0,21.0

                 [/INST] To find out how many customers left a tip, we first need to determine how many customers the waiter served in total during the lunch rush.

Step 1: Find the number of customers served before the lunch rush.
The waiter had 39 customers before the lunch rush.

Step 2: Find the number of customers added during the lunch rush.
Additional 12 customers were added during the lunch rush.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of customers served.
Total number of customers = Customers before lunch rush + Customers during lunch rush

Total number of customers = 51

Step 4: Determine how many customers didn't leave a tip.
We know that 49 customers didn't leave a tip.

Step 5: Find the number of customers who left a tip.
Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
Number of customers who left a tip = 51 - 49
Number of customers who left a tip = 2
