                    question:
                     Paige ? had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from ? it and then added 8 new songs, how many songs ! does she have on her mp3 ? player? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Paige initially had 11 songs on her mp3 player.

Step 2: She deleted 9 old songs from her mp3 player. This means, now there are:
Initial number of songs - Deleted songs = New number of songs on her mp3 player
11 - 9 = 2 songs less than the initial number

Step 3: She added 8 new songs to her mp3 player. We can find the new total number of songs by:
New number of songs = Initial number of songs - Deleted songs + Added songs
11 - 9 + 8 = 12 songs

{The final answer is: Paige has 12 songs on her mp3 player.}</s>",10,10.0,3.0

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that there were a total of 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the basketball team.

Step 2: The number of students who were called back is given as 26.

Step 3: To find the number of students who didn't make the cut, we need to subtract the number of students who were called back from the total number of students who tried out.

Step 4: So, the calculation would be: Total number of students - Number of students called back.

Step 5: Therefore, the number of students who didn't make the cut is: 39 (girls) + 4 (boys) - 26 (students called back) = 31 (students).

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many roses April bought during the sale.
 April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left. That means she bought 13 - 4 = <ins>9 roses</ins> during the sale.

 Step 2: Calculate how much money April spent on the roses.
 Each rose cost 4 dollars. So April spent 9 roses * $4 = $\boxed{36\ dollars}$ on the roses during the sale.

 Step 3: Find out how much money April earned during the sale.
 We don't have information about the price of the roses before the sale. However, we know that April spent 36 dollars on the roses during the sale. Since she had 13 roses at the beginning and 9 roses were bought during the sale, we can assume that she had 13 - 9 = <ins>4 roses</ins> that she didn't buy during the sale and sold them at the sale price.
 The earnings from selling these 4 roses would be 4 roses * $4 = $\boxed{16\ dollars}$.

 {The final answer is 16 dollars.}

 (Note: The question states that ""April had a sale where each rose was 4 dollars."" which is why we assumed that April sold her own roses at the sale price.)</s>",36,36.0,4.0

                 [/INST] To find out how many shirts Ned did not wash, we first need to determine how many shirts he did wash. We know he had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts in total. If he washed 29 shirts before school, we can find out how many he did not wash by subtracting the number of shirts he did wash from the total number of shirts he had to wash.

Short sleeve shirts = 9
Long sleeve shirts = 21

Total shirts Ned had to wash = 9 (short sleeves) + 21 (long sleeves) = 30 shirts

Number of shirts Ned washed = 29

Number of shirts Ned did not wash = Total shirts - Number of shirts washed
= 30 - 29

                     A company invited , 47 people to a luncheon, but 7 of them didn't show up. If the tables they ; had held 5 people each, how many tables do they need? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many tables the company needs, we first need to determine how many people actually showed up to the luncheon. We know that 47 people were invited, but 7 didn't show up, so:

People who showed up = Invited people - People who didn't show up
= 47 - 7
= 40

Now that we know 40 people showed up, we can divide this number by the number of people each table can hold to find out how many tables are needed:

Number of tables = People who showed up / People per table
= 40 / 5
= 8

Since we can't have a fraction of a table, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure everyone has a seat. Therefore, the company needs 9 tables to seat all the people who showed up.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Tom originally had 5 books.

Step 2: Tom sold 4 of his books, so he earned money equivalent to the number of books sold. The number of books Tom sold is subtracted from the original number of books he had.

5 (original books) - 4 (books sold) = 1 book

Step 3: Tom used the money he earned from selling the 4 books to buy 38 new books. Therefore, Tom now has the original book he kept and the new books he bought with the money earned from selling his old books.

1 (original book) + 38 (new books) = 39 books

                 [/INST] To determine how many shelves Jerry's fridge would fill up, we first need to find out how many sodas he bought in total and then divide that number by the number of sodas that can be stored on each shelf.

Total number of sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
Total number of sodas = 41 + 22
Total number of sodas = 63

Now, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas that can be stored on each shelf:

Number of shelves = Total number of sodas / Sodas per shelf
Number of shelves = 63 / 9

number of shelves ≈ 7

However, since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, Jerry would need to use at least 8 shelves to accommodate all of his sodas.

{The final answer is: Jerry would need 8 shelves to store all of his sodas.}</s>",7,7.0,8.0

                 [/INST] To find the number of small gardens Emily has, we first need to find out how many seeds she planted in the big garden, and then subtract that amount from the total number of seeds she started with to find out how many seeds were planted in the small gardens.

Step 1: Find out how many seeds Emily planted in the big garden.
She planted 29 seeds in the big garden.

Step 2: Find out how many seeds were planted in the small gardens.
The number of seeds planted in each small garden is 4. To find the number of small gardens, we need to divide the total number of seeds planted in the small gardens by the number of seeds in each small garden.

Total seeds planted in the small gardens = Total seeds - Seeds planted in the big garden
Total seeds = 41
Seeds planted in the big garden = 29

Number of small gardens = (Total seeds planted in the small gardens) / (Seeds in each small garden)
Number of small gardens = (41 - 29) / 4
Number of small gardens = 12 / 4
Number of small gardens = 3

So, Emily has 3 small gardens.

                 [/INST] To determine how long the candy will last Emily, we need to find out how many total pieces she has and then divide that number by how many pieces she eats each day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of candy pieces that Emily has. She received 5 pieces from neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister. So,

Total candy pieces = 5 (from neighbors) + 13 (from older sister)
Total candy pieces = 18

Step 2: Determine how long the candy will last her based on her daily candy intake of 9 pieces.

Number of days = Total candy pieces / Daily candy intake
Number of days = 18 / 9

Step 3: Simplify the fraction to find the final answer.

Number of days = 2

Therefore, the final answer is:

John earns $8 per lawn, so:
Amount earned if all lawns were mowed = $8 * Number of lawns

Step 2: Subtract the amount of money lost due to not mowing 7 lawns.
Lost amount = $8 * Number of un-mowed lawns

Step 3: Calculate the final amount of money earned.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of puppies at the shelter.
The shelter had 5 puppies initially, and 35 were brought in later. So, the total number of puppies at the shelter is:
5 (initial puppies) + 35 (newly brought in) = <<5+35=40>>40 puppies

Step 2: Determine the number of puppies adopted per day.
The number of puppies adopted per day is 8.

Step 3: Determine how long it takes for a certain number of puppies to be adopted.
To find out how long it takes for all the puppies to be adopted, divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies that get adopted per day.
Longitude_of_stay = Total_number_of_puppies / Number_of_puppies_adopted_per_day
= 40 / 8
= 5

Since we cannot directly divide by a whole number without specifying the number of times that number goes into the divisor, let's determine the number of times 8 goes into 40: 5
Thus, 5 groups of 8 puppies can be adopted. This means that we will have adopted 5 * 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 puppies, which equals the total number of puppies in the shelter.

                 [/INST] To find out how many cats the pet store has left after selling 10 cats, we first need to determine how many of each type of cat were sold. Let's find that out:

Step 1: Find out how many cats of each type were sold.
Since we don't have enough information to determine that, let's assume that some of the cats sold were Siamese and some were House cats. Let's say that x Siamese cats and y House cats were sold.

We know that in total, 10 cats were sold. So, we have the following system of linear equations:
x + y = 10 (1)

Step 2: Determine the number of Siamese cats sold.
Let's find the smallest possible number of Siamese cats that could have been sold such that the total number of cats sold is still at least 10.

If all 10 cats sold were House cats, then the pet store would have 8 Siamese cats left. However, since the problem states that ""A pet store had 13 siamese cats,"" this is not a valid solution.

With some experiments and elimination of impossible solutions, we can find that the smallest number of Siamese cats that can be sold and still have a valid total number of cats is 3. So, x = 3.

Now, we can calculate the number of House cats sold using equation (1): y = 10 - x = 10 - 3 = 7.

So, 3 Siamese cats and 7 House cats were sold during the sale.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cats left in the pet store.
Now that we know how many cats of each type were sold, we can find the number of cats left in the pet store:

Total number of cats left = Siamese cats left + House cats left = 13 - 3 + 5 - 7 = 11

2. Determine how many apples are needed to make one pie.
3. Calculate the number of pies that can be made with the remaining apples.

Step 1: Find the number of apples remaining after lunch distribution.
The number of apples given to students is 42, so the number of apples left is:

96 apples (initial amount) - 42 apples (given to students) = 54 apples

Step 2: Determine how many apples are needed to make one pie.
Each pie takes 6 apples, so:

1 pie = 6 apples

Step 3: Calculate the number of pies that can be made with the remaining apples.

Number of pies = Remaining apples / Apples per pie

Number of pies = 54 apples / 6 apples/pie = 9 pies

Let's call the number of brownies she needs to bake ""x."" We know that she baked 8 brownies and needs 17 in total, so:

x = Desired number of brownies
x - 8 = Number of brownies she still needs to bake

Now we need to find out how many cups of flour she uses for each brownie and how many cups of flour she has used so far:

 Cups of flour per brownie = 8
 Cups of flour used = 8 * Num. of brownies baked = 8 * 8 = 64

To find out how many more cups of flour she needs, we multiply the number of cups of flour she uses per brownie by the number of brownies she still needs to bake:

Carol picked 29 good carrots, and her mother picked 16 good carrots. So, there were 29 (Carol's good carrots) + 16 (her mother's good carrots) = <31>35<35> good carrots picked.

However, the question states that only 38 of the carrots were good. This means that there must have been bad carrots in the garden as well.

To find the number of bad carrots, we can subtract the number of good carrots picked by Carol and her mother from the total number of carrots that were good in the garden:

Number of bad carrots = Total good carrots in the garden - Good carrots picked by Carol and her mother

We know that there were 35 good carrots picked and there were 38 good carrots in the garden. So,

                     At a restaurant each adult meal costs , $8 and kids eat free. If a group of 11 people came in and 2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? 
                 [/INST] To find the total cost for the group to eat, we first need to determine the number of adults and kids in the group. We're told that there are 11 people in total and 2 of them are kids.

Number of adults = Total number of people - Number of kids
Number of adults = 11 - 2
Number of adults = 9

Next, we'll calculate the cost for the adults' meals by multiplying the number of adults by the cost of an adult meal.

Cost for adults = Number of adults × Cost per adult meal
Cost for adults = 9 × $8
Cost for adults = $72

1. Roger initially had 25 books.
2. He sold 21 of them, so the number of books he had left is: 25 (initial number) - 21 (books sold) = {3 books}
3. Roger used the money he earned from selling the 21 books to buy 30 new books. We don't know the exact amount he earned, but we can find the total number of books he now has.
4. To calculate this, we add the number of books Roger had left after selling some of his initial books (step 2), to the number of new books he bought with the earnings from the sale (step 3): 3 (initial books left) + 30 (new books) = {33 books}
5. Therefore, after selling some of his initial books and buying new ones with the earnings, Roger now has {33 books}.

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups there would be with 6 players in each group for a total of 54 players (48 new players + 6 returning players), we can divide the total number of players by the number of players per group:

Total number of players = New players + Returning players
Total number of players = 48 + 6
Total number of players = 54

Number of players per group = 6

Groups = Total number of players / Players per group
Groups = 54 / 6

Now, we'll perform the division:

Groups = 9

Groups = 9.6666666666667 (decimal value)

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we will round down to the nearest whole number as there can't be a fraction of a player.

                 [/INST] Let's break this down:

1. Nancy started with 80 files.
2. She deleted 31 files, leaving her with 80 - 31 = 49 files.
3. Each folder has 7 files.
4. To determine the number of folders, we divide the total number of files Nancy has left by the number of files per folder.

So,

5. The number of folders = Total files / Files per folder
6. = 49 files / 7 files per folder
7. = 7 folders with one extra file left (1 file more than each folder can hold)
8. Since Nancy can't have a half-folder, she'll have to make an additional folder for that extra file.

Therefore,

                 [/INST] To find out how many boxes Luke used, we first need to determine how many games he has left after selling some and packaging the rest.

1. Luke started with 39 games.
2. He sold 19 games, so he has:
   39 (games to begin with) - 19 (games sold) = 18 games left

Now, we know that Luke packs 4 games into each box, so we can calculate how many boxes he needs based on the number of games he has left.

3. We have:
   18 (games left) / 4 (games per box) = 4.5 (amount of boxes we would need if Luke still had some games left over)

Since Luke can't have half a box, we round up to the nearest whole number.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of students who were picked for the teams.
Total number of students trying out = 65
Number of students not picked = 17
Number of students picked = Total number of students trying out - Number of students not picked
= 65 - 17
= 48

Step 2: Determine the number of students in each group.
Number of students in each group = Total number of students picked / Number of groups
= 48 / 8
By dividing the number of students picked by the number of groups, we get the number of students per group as a decimal.
= 6 \frac{1}{2} (approximately)

Since we want to have an exact number of students in each group, we'll round up and have each group with 7 students and 1 additional student.

Step 3: Calculate the number of additional students needed and distribute them evenly among the groups.
Additional students per group = 1
Total additional students = Additional students per group * Number of groups
= 1 * 8
= 8

Additional students needed for each group = Additional students per group
Additional students needed for all groups = Additional students per group * Number of groups

                 [/INST] To find out how long Mike's money will last given that he makes $14 per week mowing lawns and spends $5 per week on weed eating, we need to first calculate his total earnings and then subtract his weekly expenses to find out how much money he has left each week.

Step 1: Find Mike's weekly earnings
Mike makes $14 per week mowing lawns.

Step 2: Find Mike's weekly income from weed eating
The problem states that Mike made $26 from weed eating, but it's not clear if this was a one-time payment or a weekly income. Let's assume it was a weekly income. So Mike makes an additional $26 per week from weed eating.

Step 3: Calculate Mike's total weekly earnings
Mike's total weekly earnings are the sum of his earnings from mowing lawns and from weed eating.

Total weekly earnings = Weekly earnings from mowing lawns + Weekly earnings from weed eating
Total weekly earnings = $14 + $26
Total weekly earnings = $40

Step 4: Calculate Mike's weekly expenses
Mike spends $5 per week on weed eating.

Step 5:Calculate Mike's weekly disposable income
Weekly disposable income = Total weekly earnings - Weekly expenses
Weekly disposable income = $40 - $5
Weekly disposable income = $35

Step 6: Calculate how many weeks Mike's money will last
To find out how long his money will last, we'll divide his weekly disposable income by his weekly expenses.

Number of weeks = Weekly disposable income / Weekly expenses
Number of weeks = $35 / $5
Number of weeks = 7

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the number of music files and video files on Vanessa's flash drive before deletion.
 Music files = 16
 Video files = 48

 Step 2: Add the number of music files and video files to find the total number of files on Vanessa's flash drive before deletion.
 Total files = Music files + Video files
 Total files = 16 + 48
 Total files = 64

 Step 3: Vanessa deleted 30 files from her flash drive. However, the question doesn't specify whether those deleted files were music files or video files. Let's assume that the deleted files were an equal mixture of music and video files for simplicity. This means that 15 music files and 15 video files were deleted, leaving us with:
 Music files = 16 - 15 = 1 file
 Video files = 48 - 15 = 33 files

 Step 4: Add the number of remaining music files and video files to find the total number of files on Vanessa's flash drive after deleting 30 files.
 Total files = Music files + Video files
 Total files = 1 + 33
 Total files = 34

 The final answer is: {34 files remained on Vanessa's flash drive after deleting 30 files}.

                 [/INST] To find out how many new books Victor bought, we first need to determine how many books he bought in total and how many of them were used.

1. We know that at the book fair, Victor bought 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books.
2. So, the total number of books Victor bought is: 32 adventure books + 37 mystery books = 69 books

3. The problem states that 16 of the books were used. We don't know how many of these 16 books were adventure books and how many were mystery books. So, to find out how many new books Victor bought, we need to subtract the number of used books from the total number of books bought.

4. Since we don't know how many of the used books were adventure books and how many were mystery books, we can't determine the exact number of new adventure books and new mystery books that Victor bought. Thus, we can only find the total number of new books he bought.

5. So, the number of new books Victor bought is: 69 total books - 16 used books = 53 new books

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of books Oliver has been left with.
Since a librarian took 10 books from the 46 books, that leaves Oliver with 36 books to put away.

Step 2: Calculate how many books can fit on one shelf.
Oliver can fit 4 books on one shelf.

Step 3: Determine the number of shelves needed to accommodate all the books.
Divide the total number of books Oliver has to put away by the number of books that can fit on one shelf.
Shelves needed = Total number of books / Books per shelf
Shelves needed = 36 / 4

Step 4: Simplify the calculation.

                    question:
                     Luke ? was putting his spare change into piles. He had 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes. If each pile had 3 coins in it, how many coins did he have total? 
                 [/INST] Let's reason through this problem step by step:

1. We know that Luke had 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes.
2. Each pile contains 3 coins, so the number of coins in each pile of quarters is 3 * number of quarters piles = 3 * 5 = 15 quarters.
3. Similarly, the number of coins in each pile of dimes is 3 * number of dimes piles = 3 * 5 = 15 dimes.
4. To find the total number of coins Luke had, we need to find the sum of the number of quarters and the number of dimes.
5. So, the total number of coins Luke had = Number of quarters * Coins per pile + Number of dimes * Coins per pile
6. Substituting the values from the problem, we have = 5 * 15 + 5 * 15 = 75 + 75 = 150
{The final answer is 150 coins}.</s>",30,30.0,150.0

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the given information.
Gwen recycled 5 pounds, and her friends recycled 13 pounds. For every 3 pounds recycled, they earn one point.

Step 2: Find out how many points Gwen earned.
Gwen recycled 5 pounds. To find out how many points she earned, divide the number of pounds she recycled by the number of pounds it takes to earn one point.

Points for Gwen = Pounds recycled by Gwen / Pounds per point
= 5 pounds / 3 pounds
≈ 1.67 points
Since they can't earn a fraction of a point, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

So, Gwen earned 1 point.

Step 3: Find out how many points her friends earned.
Her friends recycled 13 pounds. To find out how many points they earned, divide the number of pounds they recycled by the number of pounds it takes to earn one point.

Points for friends = Pounds recycled by friends / Pounds per point
= 13 pounds / 3 pounds
≈ 4.33 points
Since they can't earn a fraction of a point, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

So, her friends earned 4 points.

Step 4: Add up the total number of points earned by everyone.
Total points = Points for Gwen + Points for friends

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of the tickets that Haley bought for herself and her friends. Since she bought 3 tickets for herself and an unspecified number of tickets for her friends, we don't have enough information to determine the cost for her friends' tickets. Let's assume for now that Haley bought tickets for herself and her friends only.

Cost of tickets for Haley and her friends = Number of tickets for herself * Price per ticket + Number of tickets for friends * Price per ticket

Step 2:Calculate the cost of Haley's tickets only. Since we don't know how many tickets she bought for her friends, we'll calculate this amount later.

Cost of Haley's tickets = 3 * $4

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the extra tickets that Haley bought.

Number of extra tickets = 5
Cost of extra tickets = 5 * $4

Step 4: Add the cost of Haley's tickets and the cost of the extra tickets to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent = Cost of Haley's tickets + Cost of extra tickets

 Step 5: Substitute the values from the previous steps into the equation for total amount spent.

Total amount spent = (3 * $4) + (5 * $4)

 Step 6: Simplify the expression to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent = $12 + $20
Total amount spent = $22

                 [/INST] To find out how many birds the pet store has in total, we first need to determine how many parrots and parakeets are in each cage, and then multiply that number by the number of cages.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of parrots in each cage:
   We know that each cage has 8 parrots.
   So the number of parrots in one cage is: 8 parrots

2. Next, let's calculate the total number of parakeets in each cage:
   We know that each cage has 2 parakeets.
   So the number of parakeets in one cage is: 2 parakeets

3. To find out the total number of birds in one cage, we simply add the number of parrots and parakeets:
   Total number of birds in one cage = Parrots + Parakeets
   = 8 + 2
   = 10 birds

4. Since there are 4 bird cages in the pet store, we can find the total number of birds by multiplying the number of birds in each cage by the number of cages:

                 [/INST] To find out how many baggies Maria can make with the given number of cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies each bag contains.

First, let's find the total number of cookies Maria has:
chocolate chip cookies = 5
oatmeal cookies = 19

Total number of cookies = chocolate chip cookies + oatmeal cookies
Total number of cookies = 5 + 19
Total number of cookies = 24

Now, we know that each baggie contains 8 cookies. So, we can divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies each baggie holds to find out how many baggies Maria can make:

Number of baggies = Total number of cookies / Cookies per baggie
Number of baggies = 24 / 8

Number of baggies = 3

However, since we cannot make a fraction of a baggie, Maria can only make 3 full baggies with the given number of cookies, but she will still have some cookies leftover. If Maria wants to use all the cookies in baggies, she would need to make one more baggie with fewer than 8 cookies.

Therefore, {The final answer is: Maria can make 3 full baggies with 8 cookies each or 4 baggies with less than 8 cookies (she will have 2 cookies left)}.</s>",3,3.0,2.0

   Cost of roses = 8 * $3
   Cost of roses = $24

2. Cost of daisies: Zoe bought 2 daisies, and each daisy cost $3.
   Cost of daisies = Number of daisies * Cost per daisy
   Cost of daisies = 2 * $3

                 [/INST] To find out how many pages John will use in total, we need to determine how many cards can fit on one page, and then calculate how many pages are needed to store all of his cards.

First, let's figure out how many cards can fit on one page since John puts 3 cards per page:

{Number of cards per page = Number of cards in a page group × Number of cards in a page group}
{Number of cards per page = 3 ×3}

Step 1: Calculate the number of cards per page
{Number of cards per page = 9}

Next, we'll find out how many pages he will need to store his new and old cards:

For the new cards:
{Number of pages for new cards = Number of new cards ÷ Number of cards per page}

Step 2: Calculate the number of pages for new cards
{Number of pages for new cards = 8 ÷ 9 ≈ 0.89 pages}
Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll need to round up to the next whole page, so:
{Number of pages for new cards = 1 page}

Now, we'll calculate the number of pages for his old cards:
{Number of pages for old cards = Number of old cards ÷ Number of cards per page}

Step 3: Calculate the number of pages for old cards
{Number of pages for old cards = 16 ÷ 9 ≈ 1.78 pages}
Like before, we'll round up to the next whole page, so:
{Number of pages for old cards = 2 pages}

Finally, we'll sum up the number of pages needed for both the new and old cards:

Total number of pages = Number of pages for new cards + Number of pages for old cards

Step 4: Calculate the total number of pages
{Total number of pages = 1 +2}
{Total number of pages = 3 pages}

So, John will use a total of 3 pages to store his 8 new cards and 16 old cards in the binder. {The final answer is 3 pages.}</s>",8,8.0,3.0

                 [/INST] To find out how many students were in fourth grade at the end of the year, we first need to determine how many students were present after the new students arrived and the old students who left had departed.

Step 1: Determine the number of students who left.
There were 31 students at the start of the year, and 5 students left, so:
Students who left = 31 (initial number of students) - 5 (students who left) = 26 students

Step 2: Determine the number of new students.
11 new students came to school, so:
New students = 11

Step 3: Find the number of students remaining in the class.
To calculate the final student count, we add the number of students who didn't leave to the number of new students who joined:
Final student count = Student count at start + New students - Students who left
= 31 (initial) + 11 (new) - 5 (left)
= 35 (students at the end of the year)

{The final answer is: There were 35 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.}</s>",37,37.0,35.0

                 [/INST] To find out how many points Bianca and her friends earned for recycling paper, we first need to determine how many points they earned individually, and then add those points together.

1. Points earned by Bianca:
   She recycled 24 pounds, and for every 3 pounds, she earned 1 point. So, the number of points she earned is given by:
   Points earned by Bianca = Pounds recycled by Bianca / Pounds required to earn 1 point
   Points earned by Bianca = 24 pounds / 3 pounds/point
   Points earned by Bianca = 8 points

2. Points earned by Bianca's friends:
   They recycled 3 pounds, and following the same logic as above,
   Points earned by Bianca's friends = Pounds recycled by Bianca's friends / Pounds required to earn 1 point
   Points earned by Bianca's friends = 3 pounds / 3 pounds/point
   Points earned by Bianca's friends = 1 point

3. Total points earned:

                 [/INST] Let's go through this problem step by step:
1. We know that there were initially 8 chicken wings cooked for the group of 3 friends.
2. The chef then cooked 10 more chicken wings, making a total of 18 chicken wings for the group.
3. Since the friends all got the same amount, we need to find out how many chicken wings each person got by dividing the total number of wings by the number of people in the group.
4. So, we calculate: Number of chicken wings per person = Total number of chicken wings / Number of people
5. Therefore, Number of chicken wings per person = 18 / 3
6. Simplifying the fraction, we get: Number of chicken wings per person = 6

Step 2: He threw away 19 old socks, so he no longer has those.
Step 3: He bought 13 new socks and added them to his collection.

Step 4: To find the total number of socks John has now, we need to subtract the number of socks he threw away from the original amount, and then add the number of socks he bought.

Step 5: So, John started with 33 socks. He threw away 19 socks, leaving him with 33 - 19 = <<33-19=14>>14 socks. Then, he bought 13 new socks, so the total number of socks he now has is 14 + 13 = <<14+13=27>>27 socks.

1. Determine the total number of players in the team.
Total players = New players + Returning players
= 2 + 6
= 8 players

2. Calculate the number of groups required by dividing the total number of players by the number of players per group.
Number of groups = Total players / Players per group
= 8 / 4

                 [/INST] First, let's calculate how long it takes the painter to paint all 6 rooms. Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the total time needed is:

Time to paint all rooms = Number of rooms * Time to paint one room
= 6 rooms * 5 hours/room
= 30 hours

The painter has already painted 2 rooms, so he has 4 rooms left to paint. To find out how long it will take him to paint these rooms, we can subtract the time he has already spent:

Time to paint remaining rooms = Time to paint all rooms - Time already spent
= 30 hours - 10 hours (2 rooms painted)
= 20 hours

Therefore, the painter will need an additional 20 hours to paint the remaining rooms.

                     A waiter had 22 customers in his section. , If , 14 of them left and the rest of his tables had 4 people at ! each table, how many tables did he have? 
                 [/INST] To find the number of tables in the waiter's section, we first need to determine how many customers remained after 14 had left.

1. The waiter had 22 customers in his section.
2. 14 customers left, so the number of customers that remained is 22 - 14 = 8 customers.

Now, since each table had 4 customers, we can calculate the number of tables by dividing the total number of customers (after some had left) by the number of customers per table.

3. The number of remaining customers is 8, and the number of customers per table is 4.
4. Dividing the number of remaining customers by the number of customers per table gives us the number of tables: 8 / 4 = 2 tables (with 4 customers each). However, this answer is unlikely to be correct because 2 tables can only seat 8 customers, whereas we were told that there were originally 22 customers.

Let's assume that there was a mistake in the problem statement, and the original number of customers was meant to be 22 + 14 = 36.

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many pieces of clothing were put in the first load, which was a larger load. We know that 48 pieces went into one load.

Next, we need to determine how many pieces went into the smaller loads. The problem states that the remaining clothing was split into 9 equal loads.

To find the number of pieces in each small load, we can subtract the number of pieces in the large load from the total number of pieces and divide that difference by the number of small loads.

Mathematically: (Total number of pieces - Number of pieces in large load) / Number of small loads

Calculation: (120 pieces - 48 pieces) / 9

Step 2: During the year, 4 students left the class, so the number of students decreased by 4.

Step 3: We also learned that 42 new students came to the school and joined the fourth-grade class.

Step 4: To find the total number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to find the difference between the initial number of students and the number of students who left, and then add the number of new students who joined the class.

Step 5: Initial number of students = 10
Students who left = -4
New students = 42

Step 6: Number of students at the end of the year = Initial number of students - Students who left + New students

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let X be the number of tulips Bianca picked in addition to the 39 she initially picked. Let Y be the number of roses she picked in addition to the 49 she initially picked.

Step 2: We know that Bianca used a total of 81 flowers in her bouquets, so X + Y = 81.

Step 3: Since Bianca picked 39 tulips and 49 roses to begin with, we don't need to account for those in our calculation of extra flowers she picked.

Step 4: Therefore, we only need to find the extra number of each type of flower Bianca picked. Since X + Y = 81, we can find X by subtracting Y from 81 once we have found Y.

Step 5: To find Y, the number of extra roses Bianca picked, let's divide the total number of roses she picked by the number she uses in each bouquet on average (we'll assume she uses the same ratio of tulips to roses in each bouquet): 49 (initially picked roses) / (39 (initially picked tulips) / 2) = 52.26 (approximately). Since she can't pick a fraction of a flower, let's round up to the next whole number: she picks on average about 53 roses per bouquet.

Step 6: So, since she picked 49 roses to begin with, and she picked an additional X roses, we have Y = 49 + X.

Step 7: Substituting X + Y = 81 into our equation, we get 49 + X + X = 81, or 2X + 49 = 81. Solving for X, we find X = 22.

Step 8: Now we know that X = 22 is the number of extra tulips, and Y = 49 + X = 71 is the number of extra roses Bianca picked.

                 [/INST] To determine how many shirts Dave did not wash, we first need to find out how many shirts he washed before school started. We know that he washed 20 shirts, but we don't know if those were all short-sleeve or long-sleeve shirts.

Let's assume that all the shirts he washed were short-sleeve shirts. In that case, he washed 9 short-sleeve shirts + 20 long-sleeve shirts = 29 shirts in total. However, we know that he only washed 20 shirts, so this assumption is incorrect.

Let's try assuming that he washed only long-sleeve shirts. In that case, he washed 9 short-sleeve shirts + 20 long-sleeve shirts = 29 long-sleeve shirts in total, but he only washed 20 shirts. Therefore, this assumption also does not hold.

Since neither assumption leads to a satisfactory solution, we need to consider a combination of short-sleeve and long-sleeve shirts. Let x be the number of short-sleeve shirts he washed and y be the number of long-sleeve shirts he washed. We know from the problem that:

x + y = 29 (Dave washed a total of 29 shirts)
x = 9 (Dave washed 9 short-sleeve shirts initially)

To find the number of short-sleeve shirts he did not wash, we need to find the value of x in the equation x + y = 29 that satisfies y = 18 (since there were 27 long-sleeve shirts in total).

By solving the system of equations, we find x = 9 and y = 18, so Dave washed 9 short-sleeve shirts and did not wash the remaining 9 short-sleeve shirts.

                 [/INST] To determine how many shelves Cody would need to fill up, we first need to find out how many sodas he bought in total and how many can be stored on each shelf.

Cody bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas in total. So the number of sodas he bought is:

Total number of sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
Total number of sodas = 4 + 44
Total number of sodas = 48

Each shelf in the fridge can hold 6 sodas. So the number of shelves needed is:

Number of shelves = Total number of sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
Number of shelves = 48 / 6
Number of shelves = 8

Therefore, Cody would need to fill up 8 shelves in his fridge.

Total students = Boys + Girls = 26 + 46 = 72

Now, to find out how many groups of 9 students can be formed from this total, we divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group:

Groups = Total students / Students per group = 72 / 9 = 8

So, the debate team can form 8 groups of 9 students each.

                    question:
                     At a company picnic 9 managers and 15 employees decided to start a game of volleyball. : If they split into 8 teams how many . people would be on each team? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many people would be on each team if the managers and employees are split into 8 teams, we first need to determine the total number of people present at the picnic. We're given that there are 9 managers and 15 employees.

Total number of people = Number of managers + Number of employees
Total number of people = 9 + 15
Total number of people = 24

Now, we want to find out how many people are in each team if the group is split into 8 teams. To calculate that, we simply divide the total number of people by the number of teams:

People per team = Total number of people / Number of teams
People per team = 24 / 8

Now, let's perform the division:

People per team = 3

However, we made an error in our initial calculation of the total number of people. There should be 16 employees (15 employees mentioned + 1 missed). So, we'll correct the previous calculation:

Total number of people = 9 managers + 16 employees = 25 people

Let's recalculate to get the correct team size:

People per team = Total number of people / Number of teams
People per team = 25 / 8

Now, let's perform the division:

People per team = 3.125

Since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we need to round up to make each team have the maximum number of players possible. Therefore, each team would consist of 4 managers and 3 employees, for a total of 7 people. However, since there are only 25 people present, we cannot form an 8th team of 7 people. Instead, we have 1 team with 7 people and 7 teams with the originally calculated size of 3 people.

So, the final answer is:

1 team of 7 people and 7 teams of 3 people for a total of 22 people in the game of volleyball.

                 [/INST] Step 1: The book store had 4 books in the bargain bin initially.
Step 2: They sold 3 books, so the number of books in the bin became 4 (initial number) - 3 (books sold).
{The number of books in the bin after selling 3 books is 1.}
Step 3: Then, they put 10 more books in the bin.
Step 4: So, the new number of books in the bin is the number after selling 3 books (step 2) plus the number of new books added (step 3).

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The number of books in the bin is 1 ( Step 2) + 10 ( Step 3) = 11.}

However, it seems there might have been a mistake in the question as initially the number of books in the bin was 4 and after selling 3 books it became 1, but then 10 more books were put in the bin, which leads to an inconsistent situation (4 books - 3 books = 1 book, and 1 book + 10 books = 11 books).

Number of potatoes to be cooked = Total number of potatoes - Number of potatoes cooked
                                            = 13 - 5

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to cook one potato. We are given that it takes 6 minutes to cook one potato.

Now, we can find out how long it will take to cook the remaining 8 potatoes by multiplying the number of potatoes to be cooked by the time it takes to cook one potato.

Time to cook remaining potatoes = Number of potatoes to be cooked * Time to cook one potato
                                               = 8 * 6

Step 1: Find out how many baggies Robin can make with chocolate chip cookies.
Number of baggies with chocolate chip cookies = Number of cookies / Cookies per bag
= 23 / 6

This division results in a quotient of approximately 3.83, which cannot be a valid number of baggies. since Robin can't make a fraction of a bag. This indicates that she couldn't fit all the 23 chocolate chip cookies into exactly 3 full baggies; she would need to make an additional bag (with the remaining 4 cookies).

So, Robin can make:
- 3 full baggies of chocolate chip cookies
- 1 additional bag with the remaining 4 cookies

Step 2: Find out how many baggies Robin can make with oatmeal cookies.
Number of baggies with oatmeal cookies = Number of cookies / Cookies per bag
= 25 / 6

This division also results in a quotient of approximately 4.17, which cannot be a valid number of baggies for the same reason as before. Robin can't make a fraction of a bag.

To make all of the 25 oatmeal cookies, she needs to make:
- 4 full baggies

Step 3: Determine the total number of baggies Robin can make by adding the number of baggages she made with chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies.
Total number of baggages = Number of baggages with chocolate chip cookies + Number of baggages with oatmeal cookies

First, we'll calculate the number of trips Jerry makes to pick up the trays from the table with 9 trays:

Number of trips for 9 trays = Number of trays / Trays carried per trip
Number of trips for 9 trays = 9 / 8
Number of trips for 9 trays = 1 with a remainder of 1
Since Jerry cannot carry a fraction of a tray, he will need to make an additional trip to carry the remaining tray.
So, Jerry will make 2 trips to pick up the trays from the table with 9 trays.

Next, we'll calculate the number of trips Jerry makes to pick up the trays from the table with 7 trays:

Number of trips for 7 trays = Number of trays / Trays carried per trip
Number of trips for 7 trays = 7 / 8
Number of trips for 7 trays = 1 with a remainder of 1
 Again, Jerry will need an additional trip to carry the remaining tray.
 So, Jerry will make 2 trips to pick up the trays from the table with 7 trays.

Finally, to find out how many total trips Jerry will make, we add the number of trips to each table:

Total number of trips = Number of trips to table with 9 trays + Number of trips to table with 7 trays
Total number of trips = 2 + 2
Total number of trips = 4

                     ? Faye was ? playing a video game where she scores 7 points for . each treasure she finds. If she found 2 treasures ; on the first level and 6 on the second, what would her score be? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many treasures Faye found in total.
Faye found 2 treasures on the first level and 6 treasures on the second level, so she found a total of 2 + 6 = <INS>8 treasures.</INS>

Step 2: Calculate the number of points Faye earned for each level.
Faye earns 7 points for each treasure, so she earned 7 points for each of the 2 treasures on the first level, which is 7 x 2 = <INS>14 points</INS> for the first level.
Similarly, she earned 7 points for each of the 6 treasures on the second level, which is 7 x 6 = <INS>42 points</INS> for the second level.

Step 3: Calculate Faye's total score.
To find Faye's total score, we add the points she earned on each level:
Total score = Points on first level + Points on second level
Total score = 14 points + 42 points = <INS>56 points</INS>

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem:

1. Wendy started with 82 files.
2. She deleted 37 of them, leaving her with 82 - 37 = 45 files.
3. She put the rest of the files into folders, each containing 5 files.
4. To find out how many folders she ended up with, we need to divide the number of files she kept by the number of files per folder: 45 files ÷ 5 files/folder = 9 folders

However, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement. If there are 5 files in each folder and Wendy ended up with 9 folders, then there would be a total of 5 * 9 = 45 files, which is the same number she ended up keeping. This contradicts the initial statement that she had 82 files to begin with and deleted 37.

Therefore, it is unclear to determine the number of folders based on the given information. We need more information to accurately calculate the number of folders.

                    question:
                     There school's baseball team had 12 new players , and 44 returning players. If . the coach put them ? into groups with 8 players in each group, how many groups would there be? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many groups there would be, we first need to determine how many players there are in total, and then divide that number by the number of players per group.

Total number of players = New players + Returning players
Total number of players = 12 + 44
Total number of players = 56

Now, divide the total number of players by the number of players per group:

Number of groups = Total number of players / Players per group
Number of groups = 56 / 8
Number of groups = 7.0

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we must round up to the nearest whole number:

{The final answer is: There would be 8 groups with 8 players each for a total of 64 players.}

Please note that there is a discrepancy in the question and the calculation. The question states that there should be 8 players per group while the calculation results in 64 players which is 64/8 = 8 groups with 1 extra player each. If this discrepancy was intended, then the final answer remains the same. If not, the calculation and final answer should be adjusted accordingly.</s>",7,7.0,1.0

                 [/INST] To find out how many 9-dollar games Will can buy with the money he had left after spending 41 dollars on new mower blades, we need to follow these steps:

1. Subtract the amount Will spent on new mower blades from the total earnings, to get the remaining amount:
   Remaining amount = Total earnings - Amount spent on mower blades
   = 104 dollars - 41 dollars
   = 63 dollars

2. Next, divide the remaining amount by the cost of each game to determine the number of games Will can buy:
   Number of games = Remaining amount / Cost per game
   = 63 dollars / 9 dollars
   
3. To find the whole number of games, we can perform integer division:
   Whole number of games = 63 / 9
   ≈ 7. By definition, we cannot buy a fraction of a game, so Will can only buy 7 games with the remaining money and will not be able to buy the last 2 dollars worth of game(s).

Therefore, Will can buy 7 games with the money he had left after spending on new mower blades. {The final answer is: Will can buy 7 games}.</s>",7,7.0,7.0

1. Each box contains 5 scarves. So, the number of scarves in one box is 5.
2. Each box contains 5 mittens. So, the number of mittens in one box is 5.
3. Therefore, the total number of clothing items in one box (scarves and mittens) is 5 scarves + 5 mittens = 10 clothing items.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes the chef to cook the remaining 6 potatoes, we can use the information given that each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

First, we know that the chef has already cooked 6 potatoes. So, the number of potatoes he still needs to cook is:

Remaining potatoes = Total potatoes - Cooked potatoes
Remaining potatoes = 12 - 6
Remaining potatoes = 6

Therefore, the chef needs to cook 6 more potatoes. Since it takes 6 minutes to cook one potato, we can find the total time it takes to cook all 6 remaining potatoes by multiplying the number of remaining potatoes by the time it takes to cook one potato:

Time to cook remaining potatoes = Number of remaining potatoes * Time per potato
Time to cook remaining potatoes = 6 * 6
Time to cook remaining potatoes = 36 minutes

                 [/INST] To find out how many cages the pet store used to put the remaining puppies in, we first need to determine how many puppies are left after selling 7.

1. Initially, the pet store had 13 puppies.
2. They sold 7 puppies, leaving us with:

   13 (initial puppies) - 7 (sold) = 6 puppies

Now, let's determine how many puppies each cage can hold.

3. Each cage holds 2 puppies.

To find out how many cages are needed to hold the remaining 6 puppies, we can divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage.

4. Number of cages = Remaining puppies / Puppies per cage
5. Number of cages = 6 / 2

So, we calculate:

6. Number of cages = 3

However, if 3 cages can hold 6 puppies, the pet store would have only sold 3 puppies instead of the stated 7. Let's check if there's a mistake in the problem statement.

There seems to be an inconsistency between the number of puppies sold (7) and the number of puppies that can fit in 3 cages (6). Therefore, we cannot determine the number of cages used based on the given information.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many bouquets Isabel could make initially with the 66 flowers.
Initial number of bouquets = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per bouquet
Initial number of bouquets = 66 / 8
Initial number of bouquets = 8.25
Since we cannot make a fraction of a bouquet, Isabel could make 8 bouquets initially with the 66 flowers.

Step 2: Subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers to find out how many fresh flowers Isabel has left.
Number of fresh flowers = Total number of flowers - Number of wilted flowers
Number of fresh flowers = 66 - 10
Number of fresh flowers = 56

Step 3: Calculate how many bouquets Isabel can make now with the fresh flowers.

                     A pet store had 38 siamese cats and 25 house : cats. During a sale , they sold 45 cats. How many cats do they have left? 
                 [/INST] Step 1: determine how many cats were sold from each breed.
Siamese cats: 38
House cats: 25
Total cats: 63 (38 + 25)

Cats sold: 45

Siamese cats sold: (\# of Siamese cats) × (percentage of Siamese cats) / (100% + percentage of house cats)
Since the problem doesn't provide the percentage of Siamese cats sold, we cannot calculate the exact number of Siamese cats sold.

House cats sold: (\# of House cats) × (percentage of House cats) / (100% + percentage of Siamese cats)
Percentage of House cats sold is not provided in the problem.

Step 2: find out the number of cats remaining for each breed:

Siamese cats remaining: 38 - Siamese cats sold

House cats remaining: 25 - House cats sold

Until we are given the percentage of cats from each breed that were sold during the sale, we cannot determine the exact number of cats left at the pet store.

                     Carol was playing a trivia game. In the first round she scored 17 points and in the second ; round she scored 6 points. In the last round she lost 16 points. How many points did she have at the end of the game? 
                 [/INST] To find out how many points Carol had at the end of the game, we first need to determine her total score before the last round. In the first round, she scored 17 points. In the second round, she scored 6 points. So, her total score before the last round was 17 + 6 = <<17+6=23>>23 points.

Unfortunately, the problem states that Carol lost 16 points in the last round. This means that she ended up with fewer points than her score before the last round. Therefore, the information given in the problem is inconsistent. The statement that she lost 16 points in the last round cannot be true if her score before the last round was 23 points.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Dave initially bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy.

Step 2: Each box contains 3 pieces of chocolate candy. So, the total number of pieces that Dave had initially is:

Initial number of pieces = Number of boxes * Pieces per box
Initial number of pieces = 12 boxes * 3 pieces/box
Initial number of pieces = 36 pieces

Step 3: Dave gave 5 boxes to his little brother.

Number of boxes given to his little brother = 5

Step 4: Calculate the number of pieces that Dave gave away:

Pieces given away = Number of boxes given * Pieces per box
Pieces given away = 5 boxes * 3 pieces/box
Pieces given away = 15 pieces

Step 5: Calculate the number of pieces that Dave still has:

Remaining pieces = Initial number of pieces - Pieces given away
Remaining pieces = 36 pieces - 15 pieces
Remaining pieces = 21 pieces

                 [/INST] To find out how many customers left a tip, we first need to determine the total number of customers the waiter served during the lunch rush.

Step 1: Find the total number of customers the waiter served.
Total customers = Customers initially + Customers during lunch rush
Total customers = 39 + 12
Total customers = 51

Step 2: Find the number of customers who didn't leave a tip.
Customers without tips = 49

Step 3: Find the number of customers who left a tip.

                 [/INST] To find out how many pies the cafeteria could make with the remaining apples, we first need to determine how many apples were given to students and then subtract that number from the total number of apples.

Step 1:apples given to students = 5 apples per student * number of students
apples given to students = 5 apples * x

Step 2: To find the number of students, we need to divide the total number of apples given to students by the number of apples given to each student.
number of students = total apples given / apples per student
number of students = 50 apples / 5 apples = 10 students

Step 3: Subtract the number of apples given to students from the total number of apples to find the number of apples left for making pies.
remaining apples = total apples - apples given to students
remaining apples = 50 apples - (5 apples/student * number of students)
remaining apples = 50 apples - (5 apples * 10 students)
remaining apples = 50 apples - 50 apples = 0 apples

It seems there are not enough apples left to make pies. This situation is not possible, so we need to check for a mistake in the problem or go back to the source data for more accurate information.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of correct answers in each half.
Frank answered 3 questions correct in the first half and 2 questions correct in the second half.

Step 2: Multiply the number of correct answers in each half by the number of points earned per question to find the number of points earned in each half.
Points earned in the first half = Number of correct answers in the first half * Points per question
Points earned in the first half = 3 questions * 3 points/Question
Points earned in the first half = 9 points

Similarly,
Points earned in the second half = Number of correct answers in the second half * Points per question
Points earned in the second half = 2 questions * 3 points/Question
Points earned in the second half = 6 points

Step 3: Add the number of points earned in both halves to find Frank's final score.

The number of items in each box is the sum of the scarves and mittens: 4 scarves + 6 mittens = 10 items per box

Now we need to find out how many total items are in all 8 boxes:

Total number of items = Items per box * Number of boxes
Total number of items = 10 items/box * 8 boxes
Total number of items = 80 items

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that each trick deck costs 7 dollars.

Step 2: Frank bought 3 decks, so the number of decks he bought multiplied by the cost of each deck gives the amount Frank spent.

Amount Frank spent = Number of decks Frank bought * Cost per deck
= 3 * 7
= 21 dollars

Step 3: His friend bought 2 decks, so the number of decks his friend bought multiplied by the cost of each deck gives the amount his friend spent.

Amount his friend spent = Number of decks his friend bought * Cost per deck

                 [/INST] To find out how many shirts Sam didn't wash, we need to determine how many shirts he did wash and then subtract that number from the total number of shirts he had to wash.

First, let's find out how many short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts Sam washed before school:

Short sleeve shirts washed = Total short sleeve shirts - Unwashed short sleeve shirts
= 40 - (40 - 29)
= 40 - 11
= 29

Long sleeve shirts washed = Number of long sleeve shirts washed
= 23 (from the problem statement)

Now, we need to find the total number of shirts Sam had to wash before school:

Total shirts = Short sleeve shirts + Long sleeve shirts
= 40 + 23
= 63

To find out how many shirts Sam didn't wash, we can subtract the number of shirts he did wash from the total number of shirts:

Shirts not washed = Total shirts - Shirts washed
= 63 - 29
