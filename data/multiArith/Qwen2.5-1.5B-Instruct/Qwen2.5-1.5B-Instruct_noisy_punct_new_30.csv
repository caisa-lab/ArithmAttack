                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     There were ! 39 girls and ? 4 boys trying ; out ; for the schools ? basketball team. If only ; 26 of : them got called ! back, how many students didn't ! make the cut? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the total number of participants:**
   - There are 39 girls.
   - There are \( x \) boys (unknown).
   - The total number of participants is given as \( 39 + x \).

2. **Calculate the total number of participants:**
   Since we know that only 26 students made it to the tryouts, we can set up an equation where the total number of participants equals 26 plus the number of girls who did not make it.

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \( y \) be the number of boys who did not make it to the tryouts. Then, the total number of participants can be represented as:
   \[
   39 + x = 26 + y
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   We need to find \( x \), which represents the number of boys in the school's basketball team. To do this, we first isolate \( x \):
   \[
   39 + x = 26 + y
   \]
   Subtract 39 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 26 + y - 39
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   x = 26 - 39 + y
   \]
   \[
   x = -13 + y
   \]

5. **Determine \( y \):**
   Since \( y \) must be a non-negative integer representing the number of boys who did not make it to the tryouts, we have:
   \[
   y = 0
   \]

6. **Substitute \( y \) back into the equation to find \( x \):**
   \[
   x = -13 + 0
   \]
   \[
   x = -13
   \]

7. **Check if \( x \) makes sense in context:**
   Since \( x \) cannot be negative, we re-evaluate our approach. Given that the total number of participants is less than or equal to 26, there must be fewer boys than girls. Therefore, all girls made it, and no boys were left out. This means \( y = 0 \), so \( x = 0 \).

8. **Final calculation:**
   Substitute \( x = 0 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   39 + 0 = 26 + y
   \]
   \[
   39 = 26 + y
   \]
   \[
   y = 39 - 26
   \]
   \[
   y = 13
   \]

Therefore, the number of boys who did not make it to the tryouts is \( 13 \).

**The final answer is:** 13 students didn't make the cut.<|im_end|>",17

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of coloring books**:
   - Faye initially has 34 coloring books.

2. **Books given away**:
   - She gives away 3 books.
     \[
     34 - 3 = 31
     \]
   So, after giving away 3 books, Faye has 31 books left.

3. **Books bought**:
   - Then, she buys 48 more books.
     \[
     31 + 48 = 79
     \]

So, at the end, Faye will have 79 coloring books in total.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 79.<|im_end|>",79

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of apples:**
   - The school cafeteria initially has 23 apples.

2. **Subtract the apples used for lunch:**
   - They used 20 apples to make lunch.
   
   \[
   23 - 20 = 3
   \]
   After using 20 apples, there are 3 apples left in the cafeteria.

3. **Add the additional apples bought:**
   - They then buy 6 more apples.
   
   \[
   3 + 6 = 9
   \]
   After buying 6 more apples, they now have 9 apples.

4. **Final check:**
   - To ensure accuracy, let's verify if our calculations match the given information.
     Initial apples: 23
     Used for lunch: 20
     Bought new ones: 6
   
   \[
   23 - 20 + 6 = 9
   \]

Therefore, after all transactions, the school cafeteria would have **9 apples**.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of bags Megan actually recycled.
Megan had a total of 14 bags, but she did not recycle 5 of them. Therefore, we need to subtract these 5 non-recycled bags from the total number of bags.

\[
14 \text{ (total bags)} - 5 \text{ (non-recycled bags)} = 9 \text{ (recycled bags)}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the points Megan earns per bag.
According to the problem, Megan earns 8 points for each bag she recycles.

\[
\text{Points per bag} = 8 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the total points Megan earned based on the number of recycled bags.
Now that we know she recycled 9 bags, we can calculate her total points by multiplying the points per bag by the number of bags recycled:

\[
\text{Total points} = 9 \text{ (bags recycled)} \times 8 \text{ (points per bag)}
\]

### Step 4: Perform the multiplication.
\[
9 \times 8 = 72
\]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, Megan would have earned 72 points if she had recycled all 14 bags.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of roses sold**
April started with 13 roses and ended up with 4 roses left. So, the number of roses sold is:
\[ \text{Roses sold} = \text{Initial roses} - \text{Roses left} \]
\[ \text{Roses sold} = 13 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Roses sold} = 9 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the roses**
Each rose was priced at $4. Therefore, if April sold 9 roses, her total revenue would be:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Number of roses sold} \times \text{Price per rose} \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 9 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 36 \]

So, April earned **$36**.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is: The final answer is The amount of money April earned is $36.<|im_end|>",36

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of people who actually attended:**
   - The total number of invitations was 47.
   - Out of these, 7 did not show up.

   Therefore, the number of people who showed up can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of attendees} = 47 - 7 = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of tables needed:**
   - Each table holds 5 people.
   - We need to find out how many such tables are required for 40 attendees.

   To find the number of tables, we divide the total number of attendees by the capacity per table:
   \[
   \text{Number of tables} = \frac{\text{Total attendees}}{\text{Capacity per table}} = \frac{40}{5}
   \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{40}{5} = 8

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine how many books Tom sold.
2. Calculate how much money Tom made from selling those books.
3. Use that amount of money to determine how many new books Tom bought.
4. Add the number of new books to the original number of books.

Let's go through these steps in detail:

### Step 1: Determine how many books Tom sold
Tom initially had 5 books. He sold \(\frac{4}{5}\) of his books because \(4\) out of every \(5\) books were sold.

\[ \text{Number of books sold} = 5 \times \frac{4}{5} = 4 \]

So, Tom sold **4** books.

### Step 2: Calculate how much money Tom made from selling those books
Each book costs $1 (assuming the price per book is constant), so if he sold 4 books, he made:

\[ \text{Money made} = 4 \times \$1 = \$4 \]

### Step 3: Use that amount of money to determine how many new books Tom bought
Tom used the money he earned ($4) to buy 38 new books.

Since each book costs $1, buying 38 books will cost him:

\[ \text{Cost for 38 books} = 38 \times \$1 = \$38 \]

This means Tom spent all his earnings on new books. Now, let’s see what happens next.

### Step 4: Add the number of new books to the original number of books
Tom originally had 5 books, but he only bought 38 more. Therefore, after buying 38 new books, the total number of books he has becomes:

\[ \text{Total books} = 5 + 38 = 43 \]

Therefore, after selling 4 books and buying 38 new ones, Tom would have **43 books**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{43}

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of drinks
Jerry bought two types of sodas:
- Regular sodas: 41
- Diet sodas: 22

Total number of sodas = Number of regular sodas + Number of diet sodas
= 41 + 22
= 63 sodas

### Step 2: Calculate the number of shelves needed
Each shelf can hold 9 sodas.

Number of shelves required = Total number of sodas / Capacity per shelf
= 63 / 9
= 7 shelves

Therefore, Jerry would need to fill up **7 shelves** to accommodate all his sodas.

### Final Answer
The final answer is: The final answer is 7 shelves.<|im_end|>",7

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of candies Debby's sister has:**
   - Debby has 32 pieces.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of candies Debby's sister has.

   Since their total amount is 74 (as given in the problem), we can set up the equation:
   \[
   32 + x = 74
   \]

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 74 - 32 = 42
   \]
   So, Debby's sister has 42 pieces of candy.

3. **Calculate the total number of candies before eating any:**
   \[
   32 + 42 = 74
   \]

4. **Subtract the number of candies eaten on the first night from the total:**
   \[
   74 - 35 = 39

To determine how many small gardens Emily had, let's break down the information given:

1. **Total seeds**: Emily starts with 41 seeds.
2. **Seeds planted in the big garden**: She plants 29 seeds in the big garden.

Now we can calculate the number of seeds left for the small gardens:

3. **Seeds left for small gardens** = Total seeds - Seeds planted in the big garden
   \[
   41 - 29 = 12
   \]

Next, we know that each small garden gets 4 seeds. So, to find out how many small gardens she has, we divide the remaining seeds by the number of seeds per small garden:

4. **Number of small gardens** = Seeds left / Seeds per small garden
   \[
   \frac{12}{4} = 3
   \]

Therefore, Emily had 3 small gardens. 

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 3.<|im_end|>",3

                    question:
                    !  Mike is at the library helping put away ; books. ? There are 82 book to . put away ; total but ; a librarian ; takes ! 10 of them : and leaves Mike with . the rest. ? If ? he : can fit 9 books on a shelf, . how many shelves will he need? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of books left for Mike.
There are initially 82 books that need to be put away.

The librarian takes 10 books, so we subtract those from the total:

\[ \text{Books left} = 82 - 10 = 72 \]

So, Mike has 72 books remaining to put away.

### Step 2: Calculate how many shelves Mike needs if he can fit 9 books per shelf.
Mike wants to determine how many shelves he needs for his 72 books.

We divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:

\[ \text{Number of shelves needed} = \frac{72}{9} \]

Performing the division:

\[ \frac{72}{9} = 8 \]

Therefore, Mike will need **8 shelves**.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The final answer is **8 shelves**.<|im_end|>",8

                    question:
                    :  ; While on : vacation, Nancy took 49 pictures ! at the zoo and 8 at the museum. If she later deleted 38 : of , the ; pictures, how ; many pictures from her ! vacation did ? she still have? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of pictures taken:**
   - Nancy took 49 pictures at the zoo.
   - Nancy took 8 pictures at the museum.
   
   Total pictures = Pictures at the zoo + Pictures at the museum
   \[
   \text{Total pictures} = 49 + 8 = 57
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of pictures deleted:**
   - Nancy deleted 38% of the total pictures.
   
   Let \( P \) be the percentage of pictures deleted.
   \[
   P = 0.38 \times \text{Total pictures}
   \]
   Since we know the total pictures are 57:
   \[
   P = 0.38 \times 57
   \]
   Perform the multiplication:
   \[
   P = 21.66
   \]
   So, approximately 22% of the pictures were deleted.

3. **Calculate the number of pictures remaining after deletion:**
   - Subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures.
   \[
   \text{Remaining pictures} = \text{Total pictures} - (P \times \text{Total pictures})
   \]
   Substitute the values:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pictures} = 57 - (0.38 \times 57)
   \]
   Perform the subtraction:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pictures} = 57 - 21.66 = 35.34
   \]

Therefore, Nancy still has approximately 35.34 pictures left from her vacation.<|im_end|>",19

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of remaining windows.
2. Calculate the total time required to install all windows.

**Step 1: Determine the number of remaining windows**

- Total number of windows = 14
- Number of windows already installed = 8

Number of remaining windows = Total number of windows - Number of windows already installed
= 14 - 8
= 6

So, there are 6 more windows left to be installed.

**Step 2: Calculate the total time required to install all windows**

Given that it takes 8 hours to install one window, for 6 windows, the total installation time would be:
Total time (in hours) = Number of remaining windows * Time per window
= 6 * 8
= 48 hours

Therefore, it will take **48 hours** for the builder to install the remaining windows.

{The final answer is} 48 hours.<|im_end|>",48

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of oranges thrown away.
- The store initially has 40 oranges.
- It throws away 25 oranges.

Step 1a: Subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial total.
\[ 40 - 25 = 15 \]

So, after throwing away 25 oranges, there are 15 oranges left in the bin.

### Step 2: Add the newly added oranges to the remaining oranges.
- There were originally 40 oranges.
- After throwing away 25, 15 oranges remain.
- The store then adds 21 more oranges.

Step 2a: Add the newly added oranges to the remaining oranges.
\[ 15 + 21 = 36 \]

Therefore, after adding 21 new oranges, there will be **36** oranges in the bin.

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Identify the total number of customers:**
   - There were 7 customers in total.

2. **Determine how many customers tipped:**
   - Out of these 7 customers, only 5 did not leave a tip.
   - Therefore, \(7 - 5 = 2\) customers tipped.

3. **Calculate the amount earned per customer who tipped:**
   - Each of the 2 customers who tipped received $3.
   - So, the total amount earned from tips is \(2 \times 3 = \$6\).

4. **Add the tip earnings to any other revenue:**
   - The problem states that there was no mention of any additional revenue (other than the tips), so we can assume the entire amount earned comes from the tips.

Therefore, the total amount of money the waiter earned is $\$6$.

                    ;  A waiter ? at 'The ! Greasy ? Spoon' restaurant had 26 customers ; to wait on. During the lunch rush he ! added another : 27 customers. If 27 of the . customers didn't leave him a tip, , how ! many . customers did , leave a tip? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many customers left a tip based on the information given.

1. **Initial number of customers**:
   The waiter initially had 26 customers to serve during the lunch rush.

2. **Additional customers added**:
   He then added an additional 27 customers to his list of customers.

3. **Total number of customers**:
   We can calculate the total number of customers by adding the initial count to the additional count.
   \[
   \text{Total Customers} = 26 + 27 = 53
   \]

4. **Customers who didn’t leave a tip**:
   Out of these 53 customers, 27 did not leave a tip.

5. **Customers who did leave a tip**:
   To find out how many customers left a tip, subtract the number of customers who did not leave a tip from the total number of customers.
   \[
   \text{Customers who left a tip} = 53 - 27 = 26
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 26 customers.<|im_end|>",26

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial Stock**: The store initially had 17 giant stuffed bears.

2. **New Shipment**: They received an additional shipment containing 10 more bears.

3. **Total Bears**: To find out how many bears there are in total, we add these two numbers together.
   \[
   17 + 10 = 27
   \]
   So, the total number of bears is 27.

4. **Bears per Shelf**: Each shelf can hold 9 bears.

5. **Number of Shelves Needed**: To determine how many shelves are needed to accommodate all the bears, we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears that fit on one shelf.
   \[
   \frac{27}{9} = 3
   \]
   Since 27 divided by 9 equals exactly 3, we don't need to round up or down; 3 is the exact quotient.

Therefore, the store used **3** shelves to place all the bears.<|im_end|>",3

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of books Gwen has. Let's break down the information given:

1. **Number of shelves for mystery books:**
   - Gwen has 5 shelves dedicated to mystery books.

2. **Number of books per shelf (for mystery books):**
   - Each shelf contains exactly 4 books.

3. **Total number of mystery books:**
   - Since there are 5 shelves and each shelf holds 4 books, we can calculate the total number of mystery books as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total mystery books} = 5 \times 4 = 20
     \]

4. **Number of shelves for picture books:**
   - Gwen also has 3 shelves dedicated to picture books.

5. **Number of books per shelf (for picture books):**
   - We are not given the exact number of books per shelf for picture books, but we know that the number of picture books does not affect the total number of books because we only need to find the total number of books.

6. **Calculate the total number of books:**
   - The total number of books is simply the sum of the mystery books and the picture books.
   - Since the number of picture books is not specified, we cannot determine the exact number without additional information about them.

Therefore, the total number of books Gwen has depends on the number of picture books, which is not provided in the problem statement.

**Final Answer:**  
Given the information provided, we do not have enough data to determine the total number of books. Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pictures Wendy placed in each of the five albums after putting some in an album.

1. **Total number of pictures**: Wendy has uploaded 79 pictures.
2. **Number of pictures in one album**: Wendy put 44 pictures into one album.
3. **Remaining pictures after placing them in one album**:
   - Subtract the number of pictures in one album from the total number of pictures.
     \[
     79 - 44 = 35
     \]
   So, there are 35 pictures left that she needs to distribute among the remaining albums.

4. **Distribute these remaining pictures into 5 different albums**:
   - We need to divide the remaining 35 pictures equally among 5 albums.
     \[
     \frac{35}{5} = 7
     \]
   Therefore, each of the five albums will contain 7 pictures.

So, the final answer is: Each album contains 7 pictures.<|im_end|>",7

2. **Calculate the number of groups if each group contains 9 students:**
   - We need to divide the total number of students (45) by the number of students per group (9).
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total students}}{\text{Students per group}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{45}{9}

   - During Game 6, only 5 members showed up (since 11 - 6 = 5).

3. **Number of members who did show up**:
   - Since 5 members showed up for Game 6, we need to calculate how many members actually participated in the competition.
   
4. **Calculation of participation**:
   - We know from previous data that if each participating member scores 9 points and there are 5 members showing up, then \(5 \times 9\) would be the total score.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Victor earned over the two days based on his hourly wage. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate Victor's earnings for Monday:**
   - Victor works 5 hours per day.
   - His hourly wage is $6.

   \[
   \text{Earnings (Monday)} = \text{Hours Worked} \times \text{Hourly Wage}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Earnings (Monday)} = 5 \times 6 = \$30
   \]

2. **Calculate Victor's earnings for Tuesday:**
   - Similarly, Victor also works 5 hours per day.
   - Again, his hourly wage is $6.

   \[
   \text{Earnings (Tuesday)} = \text{Hours Worked} \times \text{Hourly Wage}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Earnings (Tuesday)} = 5 \times 6 = \$30
   \]

3. **Total Earnings Over Two Days:**
   - To find out how much Victor earned in total over the two days, we add his earnings from both days together.

   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings (Monday)} + \text{Earnings (Tuesday)}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = 30 + 30 = \$60

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cupcakes left after Todd eats some.**

- Total cupcakes baked = 71
- Number of cupcakes eaten by Todd = 43
- Cupcakes left = Total cupcakes - Cupcakes eaten by Todd

\[ \text{Cupcakes left} = 71 - 43 \]

\[ \text{Cupcakes left} = 28 \]

**Step 2: Determine how many packages can be made with the remaining cupcakes, given that each package contains 7 cupcakes.**

- Number of cupcakes per package = 7
- Number of packages = Total cupcakes left / Cupcakes per package

\[ \text{Number of packages} = \frac{\text{Cupcakes left}}{\text{Cupcakes per package}} \]

\[ \text{Number of packages} = \frac{28}{7} \]

\[ \text{Number of packages} = 4 \]

Therefore, Megan can make **4 packages** with the remaining cupcakes.<|im_end|>",4

3. **Number of players after additional join:**
   - The new total number of players is 4.

4. **Lives per player:**
   - Each player has 6 lives.

5. **Total number of lives:**
   - To find the total number of lives, we multiply the number of players by the number of lives per player.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of flowers available:**
   Wendy picked 103 flowers.

2. **Calculate the number of bouquets that can be made initially:**
   Each bouquet contains 8 flowers.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of bouquets} = \frac{\text{Total flowers}}{\text{Flowers per bouquet}}
   \]
   
   Substituting the values:
   
   \[
   \text{Number of bouquets} = \frac{103}{8}
   \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   
   \[
   \text{Number of bouquets} = 12.875
   \]

4. **Since we cannot have a fraction of a bouquet, we take only the whole number part:**
   
   \[
   \text{Whole number of bouquets} = 12
   \]

5. **Subtract the number of wilted flowers from the initial number of bouquets:**
   
   47 flowers wilted, so we need to subtract these from the total number of bouquets she can make:
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining bouquets} = 12 - 47
   \]

6. **Perform the subtraction:**
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining bouquets} = 12 - 47 = -35
   \]

This calculation shows that after accounting for the wilted flowers, there are not enough flowers left to even start making any more bouquets because the remaining number of bouquets is negative.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of books Adam sold**

Adam initially had 48 books. He sold 19% of his books.

Number of books sold = \( \frac{19}{100} \times 48 \)

\[ Number\ of\ books\ sold = \frac{19}{100} \times 48 \]

\[ Number\ of\ books\ sold = 0.19 \times 48 \]

\[ Number\ of\ books\ sold = 9.12 \]

Since Adam can't sell a fraction of a book, we'll round down to the nearest whole number:

\[ Number\ of\ books\ sold = 9 \]

So, Adam sold 9 books.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Adam earned from selling the books**

Let's assume the price per book is $1 (since no other information is provided about the price).

Total earnings = \( 9 \times 1 \)

\[ Total\ earnings = 9 \]

**Step 3: Use the money earned to buy new books**

Adam uses the money earned from selling the books to buy 38 new books.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of books Adam has after buying the new ones**

Initially, Adam had 48 books.

After selling 9 books, he has:

\( 48 - 9 = 39 \) books left.

He then buys 38 more books.

Final total number of books = \( 39 + 38 \)

\[ Final\ total\ number\ of\ books = 77 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is}. 77 books.<|im_end|>",67

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. First, we need to calculate the total number of people going on the field trip.
   - There are 12 students and 3 adults, so that's 12 + 3 = 15 people.

2. We know that each van can hold 5 people. So, to find out how many vans are needed, we divide the total number of people by the capacity of one van.
   - The calculation would be: 15 ÷ 5 = 3 vans.

Therefore, Nancy's class will need 3 vans for their field trip to the zoo.<|im_end|>",3

                    question:
                    :  For a birthday ! party : Tom bought ! 4 regular sodas and : 52 diet . sodas. If ? his ! fridge would only , hold 7 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how many shelves Tom's fridge will need to accommodate all the sodas, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of sodas:**
   - Tom bought 4 regular sodas.
   - He also bought 52 diet sodas.
   
   Total sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
   
   \[
   \text{Total sodas} = 4 + 52 = 56
   \]

2. **Determine how many sodas fit on one shelf:**
   - Each shelf can hold 7 sodas.

3. **Calculate the number of shelves needed:**
   - To find out how many shelves are required for 56 sodas, we divide the total number of sodas by the number that fits on one shelf.

   Number of shelves = \(\frac{\text{Total sodas}}{\text{Sodas per shelf}}\)

   \[
   \text{Number of shelves} = \frac{56}{7} = 8
   \]

Therefore, Tom would need to fill up **8 shelves** in his fridge to accommodate all the sodas.<|im_end|>",8

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial number of apples.
2. Subtract the number of apples used for lunch.
3. Add the additional apples purchased.

Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Initial Number of Apples
The school cafeteria initially has 38 apples.

### Step 2: Subtracting Apples Used for Lunch
They use 20 apples to make lunch for the students.

\[ \text{Apples remaining} = 38 - 20 \]

\[ \text{Apples remaining} = 18 \]

### Step 3: Adding Additional Apples Purchased
After using some apples, they buy an additional 28 apples.

\[ \text{Final number of apples} = 18 + 28 \]

\[ \text{Final number of apples} = 46 \]

So, after all transactions, the school cafeteria will have **46** apples. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

### Step 2: Calculate how many trips Luke can make.
Luke can carry 4 trays per trip.

Number of trips required = Total trays / Number of trays per trip
= 36 trays / 4 trays/trip
= 9 trips

### Conclusion:
Luke will need to make **9** trips to pick up all the trays.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 9 trips.<|im_end|>",9

To determine how many pies can be made from the remaining apples, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of apples left after distributing some for lunch:**
   - Start with the total number of apples available initially.
   - Subtract the number of apples given to students for lunch.

   \[
   \text{Remaining apples} = 96 - 42 = 54
   \]

2. **Determine how many pies can be made with the remaining apples if each pie requires 6 apples:**

   \[
   \text{Number of pies} = \frac{\text{Remaining apples}}{\text{Apples per pie}}
   \]

3. Substitute the values into the equation:

   \[
   \text{Number of pies} = \frac{54}{6}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine who picked carrots**
- Vanessa picked 17 carrots.
- Her mom also picked some carrots.

Let's denote:
- \( V \) = number of carrots picked by Vanessa.
- \( M \) = number of carrots picked by Vanessa's mom.

From the given information:
\[ V = 17 \]

We know that the total number of carrots picked by both is equal to the sum of the carrots picked by Vanessa and her mom:
\[ V + M = \text{Total number of carrots} \]

Given that the total number of carrots is 24 (since 24 of them were good), we can find out how many carrots were picked in total:
\[ \text{Total number of carrots} = 24 \]

So,
\[ 17 + M = 24 \]
Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 24 - 17 \]
\[ M = 7 \]

Therefore, Vanessa's mom picked 7 carrots.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of bad carrots**

Since only 24 of the carrots were good, the remaining carrots must be bad. We already found out that 24 carrots were picked in total. So, the number of bad carrots is:
\[ \text{Bad carrots} = \text{Total carrots picked} - \text{Good carrots} \]
\[ \text{Bad carrots} = 24 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Bad carrots} = 0 \]

Thus, there are no bad carrots among the carrots picked by Vanessa and her mom.

   - Tiffany has already used 8 cups of flour.
   - She needs a total of 17 cups of flour for all the brownies.
   - Therefore, the total amount of flour required = 17 cups.

2. **Calculate how much more flour is needed:**
   - Subtract the amount of flour she has already used from the total amount needed.
   - Total flour needed = 17 cups

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Determine the number of adults in the group.
2. Calculate the total cost for the adults.
3. Calculate the total cost for the kids (which is free).
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3.

Step 1: Number of adults
There are 11 people in total, and 2 of them are kids. Therefore, the number of adults is:
\[ \text{Number of adults} = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Step 2: Total cost for adults
Each adult meal costs $8. So, the total cost for the adults is:
\[ \text{Total cost for adults} = 9 \times 8 = 72 \]

Step 3: Total cost for kids
Since kids get their meals for free, the cost for the kids is $0.

Step 4: Final total cost
Add the total cost for adults and the cost for kids:
\[ \text{Final total cost} = 72 + 0 = 72 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Roger ? had 25 books. ? If he . sold 21 of them and used ? the money he earned , to buy 30 new books, how ? many books would Roger . have? ; 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the amount of money Roger made from selling his books.
Roger sold 21 books at an unknown price per book (let's call it \( P \)). So, the total money he earned can be represented as:
\[ \text{Total Money} = 21 \times P \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of new books Roger bought with that money.
Roger then spent all of the money on 30 new books. Since the cost of one book is \( C \), the equation for the total cost of 30 books is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 30 \times C \]
We know that the total cost equals the total money earned from selling the books, so:
\[ 30 \times C = 21 \times P \]
From here, we can express \( C \) in terms of \( P \):
\[ C = \frac{21P}{30} = \frac{7P}{10} \]

### Step 3: Determine the total number of books Roger has after buying new ones.
Initially, Roger had 25 books. After selling 21 books, he had:
\[ 25 - 21 = 4 \] books left.

Then, he used the money to buy 30 new books. The total number of books now is:
\[ 4 + 30 = 34 \]

So, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial Lives**: Wendy starts with 10 lives.
2. **Lives Lost**: She loses 6 lives in a difficult part of the game.
   - Calculation: \( 10 \text{ (initial lives)} - 6 \text{ (lives lost)} = 4 \text{ (remaining lives after losing lives)} \)

Now we need to find out how many lives Wendy has after gaining additional lives from the next level.

3. **Lives Gained**: The game gives her 37 more lives in the next level.
   - Calculation: \( 4 \text{ (remaining lives)} + 37 \text{ (additional lives)} = 41 \text{ (total lives)} \)

Therefore, the total number of lives Wendy will have at the end is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Total number of players:**
   - The baseball team has 48 new players.
   - They also have some returning players (unknown quantity).
   - Let's denote the unknown number of returning players as \( x \).

2. **Calculate the total number of players:**
   \[
   \text{Total players} = 48 + x
   \]

3. **Determine the number of groups:**
   - Each group contains 6 players.
   - We need to find out how many such groups can be formed from the total number of players.

4. **Formulate the equation for the number of groups:**
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total players}}{6}
   \]
   Substituting the expression for total players:
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{48 + x}{6}
   \]

5. **Simplify the fraction:**
   To simplify the division, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 6:
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{48}{6} + \frac{x}{6} = 8 + \frac{x}{6}
   \]

6. **Interpret the result:**
   The simplified form indicates that the number of groups depends on the value of \( x \) (the number of returning players). 

7. **Conclusion:**
   Without knowing the exact number of returning players (\( x \)), we cannot determine the exact number of groups. However, if we assume all returning players are included, then the formula simplifies to 8 groups.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of files remaining after deletion:**
   - Nancy originally had 80 files.
   - She deleted 31 files.
   - Therefore, the number of files remaining = \( 80 - 31 \).

2. **Calculate the number of files left after deleting:**
   \[
   80 - 31 = 49
   \]

3. **Divide the remaining files into folders:**
   - Each folder contains 7 files.
   - To find out how many folders she has, we need to divide the total number of remaining files (49) by the number of files per folder (7).
   
4. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{49}{7} = 7

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of students who got picked for the team**

We know that there are 65 students in total and 17 did not get picked. Therefore, the number of students who got picked is:

\[ \text{Number of picked students} = \text{Total students} - \text{Students who didn't get picked} \]
\[ \text{Number of picked students} = 65 - 17 \]
\[ \text{Number of picked students} = 48 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of students per group**

Now, we have 48 students who got picked and they are divided into 8 groups. To find out how many students are in each group, we divide the number of picked students by the number of groups:

\[ \text{Students per group} = \frac{\text{Number of picked students}}{\text{Number of groups}} \]
\[ \text{Students per group} = \frac{48}{8} \]
\[ \text{Students per group} = 6 \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify total number of pictures**: Isabel has uploaded 25 pictures.

2. **Calculate number of pictures in one album**: Isabel placed 10 pictures into one album.

3. **Subtract the number of pictures in one album from the total**:
   \[
   25 - 10 = 15
   \]
   This means there are 15 pictures left after placing some in one album.

4. **Determine how many albums she used for the remaining pictures**: Isabel used 5 different albums for these remaining pictures.

5. **Divide the remaining pictures equally among the 5 albums**:
   \[
   \frac{15}{5} = 3
   \]

So, each of the 5 albums contains 3 pictures.

6. **Final check**: To ensure accuracy, we can add up the number of pictures in all five albums:
   \[
   10 (from the first album) + 3 (in each of the other four albums) = 10 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 10 + 15 = 25

This confirms that our calculations are correct.

Therefore, the final answer is: Each album contains 3 pictures.<|im_end|>",3

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of pictures taken.
Gwen took a total of 41 pictures during her vacation.

### Step 2: Subtract the number of pictures deleted.
She deleted 15 pictures from her collection.

\[ \text{Pictures remaining} = \text{Total pictures} - \text{Pictures deleted} \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Pictures remaining} = 41 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Pictures remaining} = 26 \]

So far, we've determined that Gwen has 26 pictures left after deleting some.

### Step 3: Calculate the difference between the pictures taken at the zoo and those taken at the museum.
We know that she took 29 pictures at the museum.

Let \( x \) be the number of pictures taken at the zoo.

From the information given:
\[ x + 29 = 41 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 41 - 29 \]
\[ x = 12 \]

Therefore, Gwen took 12 pictures at the zoo.

### Step 4: Verify the number of pictures taken at the zoo and the museum together.
Since the sum of pictures taken at both places should equal the total number of pictures taken:

\[ 12 (zoo) + 29 (museum) = 41 \]

This verifies our calculation since:

\[ 12 + 29 = 41 \]

### Final Answer:
Gwen still has **26** pictures from her vacation.<|im_end|>",55

                    question:
                     A . pet shelter had 2 puppies when another 34 . were brought ? in. ; If 4 : puppies , a day are adopted, , how long would . it take for all of them to be . adopted? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of puppies**: The shelter initially has 2 puppies.

2. **Puppies added**: Another 34 puppies are brought into the shelter.
   - Total puppies after adding more: \( 2 + 34 \)

3. **Calculate total number of puppies**:
   \[
   2 + 34 = 36
   \]

4. **Daily adoption rate**: Puppies are adopted at a rate of 4 per day.

5. **Determine time required for all puppies to be adopted**:
   - We need to find out how many days (let's call this number \(d\)) it takes for 36 puppies to be adopted if 4 puppies are adopted each day.

6. **Set up the equation**:
   \[
   4d = 36
   \]

7. **Solve for \(d\)**:
   \[
   d = \frac{36}{4} = 9
   \]

Therefore, it will take 9 days for all of the puppies to be adopted.

Final Answer: {The final answer is} 9 days.<|im_end|>",9

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of clothes**: Will has 59 pieces of clothing.
2. **Clothes in one load**: He puts 32 of them in one load.
3. **Clothes left after putting in one load**: Subtracting the clothes already accounted for from the total gives us: \( 59 - 32 = 27 \) pieces of clothing left.
4. **Number of smaller loads**: Will decides to split these remaining clothes into 9 equal loads.
5. **Calculating clothes per load**: Divide the remaining clothes by the number of smaller loads to find out how many pieces will be in each load: \( \frac{27}{9} = 3 \).

Therefore, each of the smaller loads would contain 3 pieces of clothing.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of books Victor bought.
Victor bought 32 adventure books + 37 mystery! books = 69 books.

Step 2: Calculate the number of unused books from the mystery! category.
Since 16% of the mystery! books were used, then 84% (100% - 16%) of the mystery! books were not used.
Number of mystery! books not used = 84% of 37 books.
= 0.84 * 37
≈ 30.58 ≈ 31 books (since we're dealing with whole books).

Step 3: Subtract the number of used books from the total number of books to find out how many new books were purchased.
New books = Total books - Used books.
= 69 - 31
= 38 books.

Therefore, Victor bought 38 new books in addition to the original purchase.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the number of books Adam has after selling some:**
   - Adam initially had 33 books.
   - He sold 11 books.

   \[
   33 - 11 = 22
   \]

   So, after selling his books, Adam has 22 books left.

2. **Determine the amount of money Adam earned from selling his books:**
   - We don't know the price per book yet, but we can assume that he sold all 11 books at one price (let's call it \( P \)).

   \[
   11P
   \]

   This is the total money Adam earns from selling his books.

3. **Calculate the cost of the new books Adam buys with the money he earned:**
   - Adam uses the money he earned to buy 23 new books.
   - Let’s denote the price per book for these new books as \( Q \).

   \[
   23Q
   \]

4. **Relate the earnings from selling books to the cost of buying books:**
   - The money Adam earns from selling his books should equal the cost of the 23 new books.

   \[
   11P = 23Q
   \]

5. **Solve for \( Q \) in terms of \( P \):**

   \[
   Q = \frac{11P}{23}
   \]

6. **Find out how many books Adam needs to sell to earn $100 based on the price \( Q \):**
   - Since Adam sells his remaining 11 books, he will earn \( 11P \).
   - To find out if he can buy 23 new books with this money, let's set up an equation where \( x \) represents the number of books he needs to sell to get exactly $100.

   \[
   11P = 23Q
   \]

7. **Substitute \( Q \) into the equation:**

   \[
   11P = 23 \left(\frac{11P}{23}\right)
   \]

8. **Simplify the equation:**

   \[
   11P = 11P
   \]

9. **Divide both sides by \( 11P \) to confirm that the relationship holds true:**

   \[
   1 = 1
   \]

This confirms that the relationship between the prices is correct.

Therefore, Adam would have \boxed{22} books left after selling 11 books and using the remaining money to buy 23 new books.<|im_end|>",45

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the number of shelves**: Nancy has two shelves of mystery books and six shelves of picture books.
   - Mystery books: 2 shelves × 6 books per shelf = 12 books
   - Picture books: 6 shelves × 4 books per shelf = 24 books

2. **Calculate the total number of books**:
   - Total mystery books + Total picture books = 12 books (mystery) + 24 books (picture) = 36 books

Therefore, Nancy had a total of 36 books.

{The final answer is} The final answer is 36 books.<|im_end|>",48
" Paul had saved up 3 dollars. If , he . received another ? 7 dollars for his allowance, : how many 5 dollar toys , could ; he buy? ? ","<|im_start|>system

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     Paul had saved up 3 dollars. If , he . received another ? 7 dollars for his allowance, : how many 5 dollar toys , could ; he buy? ? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Savings**: Paul initially has $3 in savings.

2. **Allowance Received**: He receives an additional amount for his allowance. Let's denote this unknown value as \( x \).

   According to the problem, ""If, he"", he means that if there was some condition or context (which isn't provided here), but we assume he did something related to receiving money for his allowance. However, since no specific conditions are given, we will focus on the allowance itself.

   Therefore, after receiving his allowance, his total savings would be:
   \[
   3 + x = \text{Total Savings}
   \]

3. **Cost of Toys**: Each toy costs $5.

4. **Number of Toys That Can Be Purchased**: To find out how many toys Paul can buy, we need to divide the total savings by the cost of one toy.
   \[
   \text{Number of toys} = \frac{\text{Total Savings}}{5}
   \]

5. **Substitute the Total Savings from Step 2**:
   \[
   \text{Number of toys} = \frac{3 + x}{5}
   \]

6. **Simplify the Expression**:
   Since \( x \) represents the amount of money Paul received for his allowance, and without knowing the exact value of \( x \), we cannot simplify further.

However, assuming \( x \) is such that it allows him to purchase whole numbers of toys, we can infer that \( x \) must be a multiple of 5 so that the result is an integer. 

Let's test this assumption:

- If \( x = 0 \):
  \[
  \text{Number of toys} = \frac{3 + 0}{5} = \frac{3}{5} \approx 0.6 \quad (\text{not possible since number of toys must be a whole number})
  \]
  
- If \( x = 5 \):
  \[
  \text{Number of toys} = \frac{3 + 5}{5} = \frac{8}{5} = 1.6 \quad (\text{again not possible})
  \]

Since neither case works, we should reconsider our initial assumptions. Given that \( x \) is likely a small positive integer, let's try \( x = 5 \):

- If \( x = 5 \):
  \[
  \text{Number of toys} = \frac{3 + 5}{5} = \frac{8}{5} = 1.6 \quad (\text{still not possible})
  \]

Given these results, it seems we might have misunderstood the allowance concept. Assuming Paul received exactly $5 for his allowance, then:

- After saving $3 and receiving $5, his total savings become:
  \[
  3 + 5 = 8 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- Now, to determine how many toys he can buy at $5 each:
  \[
  \text{Number of toys} = \frac{8}{5} = 1.6
  \]

This suggests that Paul cannot buy any whole number of toys because he only has enough money to afford a partial toy. Thus, the correct interpretation should lead us back to considering the allowance correctly. Given the allowance logic, if Paul actually gets exactly $5, he effectively buys 1 full toy (since 1 toy costs $5). 

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 1 toy.<|im_end|>",2

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial count**: Katie starts with 85 files.

2. **Files deleted**: Katie deletes 40 files.
   
   - After deleting 40 files, the remaining number of files is \( 85 - 40 = 45 \).

3. **Distribution to folders**:
    - Each folder contains 5 files.

4. **Calculating the number of folders**:
    - To find out how many folders Katie ends up with, we divide the total number of remaining files (45) by the number of files per folder (5).
    
     \[
     \text{Number of folders} = \frac{\text{Total remaining files}}{\text{Files per folder}} = \frac{45}{5}

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the types of coins**: We need to determine whether Luke has only quarters or both quarters and dimes.
2. **Calculate the number of quarters per pile**: Each pile contains 3 coins, and we know there are 5 piles of quarters. So, let’s calculate the total number of quarters.
3. **Calculate the number of dimes per pile**: Similarly, since there are 5 piles of dimes, and each pile contains 3 coins (which must be either all dimes or mixed), we can deduce that each pile also contains 3 coins.
4. **Sum up the total coins**: Add the total number of quarters and the total number of dimes.

Now, let's perform these calculations:

1. **Total coins from quarters**:
   - Since there are 5 piles of quarters and each pile contains 3 coins, the total number of coins from quarters is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \).

2. **Total coins from dimes**:
   - There are also 5 piles of dimes, and each pile contains 3 coins. Therefore, the total number of coins from dimes is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \).

Since each coin represents one type of coin (either quarter or dime), the total number of coins Luke has is the sum of the coins from quarters and dimes.

Kaleb bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy. Each box contains 6 pieces.

Total number of chocolates = Number of boxes * Chocolates per box
= 14 boxes * 6 chocolates/box
= 84 chocolates

### Step 2: Subtract the chocolates given away from the total number of chocolates.
Kaleb gave 5 chocolates to his younger brother.

Number of chocolates left = Total number of chocolates - Given chocolates
= 84 chocolates - 5 chocolates
= 79 chocolates

### Conclusion:
After giving chocolates to his younger brother, Kaleb still has 79 pieces of chocolate.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 79.<|im_end|>",54

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Identify the total number of pieces of furniture:**
   - Maria bought 2 new chairs.
   - Maria bought 2 new tables.

   Total number of pieces = Chairs + Tables
   \[
   \text{Total number of pieces} = 2 (\text{chairs}) + 2 (\text{tables}) = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time spent on each piece of furniture:**
   - The total time spent on all pieces of furniture is 8 minutes.
   - There are 4 pieces of furniture in total.

   Time per piece = Total time ÷ Number of pieces
   \[
   \text{Time per piece} = \frac{8 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ pieces}} = 2 \text{ minutes per piece}
   \]

3. **Determine the time taken to finish putting together one chair:**
   - Since there are 2 chairs, and each chair takes 2 minutes to put together,
   \[
   \text{Time for one chair} = 2 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Summarize the time taken to finish putting together one table:**
   - Each table also takes 2 minutes to put together.

Therefore, the time taken to finish putting together both the chairs and the tables will be the same as the time for one chair or one table since they both take 2 minutes.

Final Answer: It took her 2 minutes to finish putting together both the chairs and the tables.<|im_end|>",32

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Each shelf has exactly 8 books.
   - Bianca has 5 shelves for mystery books.
   - Bianca also has some number of shelves (unknown) for picture books.

2. **Calculate the number of mystery books:**
   - Since each shelf has 8 books and there are 5 mystery books shelves,
     \[
     \text{Number of mystery books} = 5 \times 8 = 40
     \]

3. **Determine the number of picture book shelves:**
   - The total number of shelves is \(5 + \text{number of picture book shelves}\).

4. **Set up an equation to find the number of picture book shelves:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of picture book shelves.
   - Then, \(x\) shelves will contain \(8\) books each.

5. **Express the total number of books in terms of \(x\):**
   - Total number of books = Number of mystery books + Number of picture books
   \[
   \text{Total number of books} = 40 + 8x
   \]

6. **Solve for \(x\), knowing that the total number of books must be a whole number:**
   - We need to ensure that the total number of books is consistent across all shelves.

7. **Assume we know the total number of books:**
   - Let's say the total number of books is \(T\).
   - We can write the equation as:
     \[
     T = 40 + 8x
     \]
   - For example, if \(T = 100\):
     \[
     100 = 40 + 8x \implies x = \frac{100 - 40}{8} = 9
     \]
   - So, if \(x = 9\), then the total number of books would be \(100\).

8. **Verify the solution:**
   - If \(x = 9\), then the total number of books is indeed \(100\).
   - This means the total number of books is \(100\).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{100}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of bags Paul filled on both days.
2. Calculate the total number of cans by multiplying the number of bags by the number of cans per bag.

Let's start with the first step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of bags filled on both days
- On Saturday, Paul filled 6 bags.
- On Sunday, Paul filled 3 more bags than what he filled on Saturday. Therefore, he filled \(3\) bags on Sunday.

So, the total number of bags filled over the two days is:
\[ \text{Total Bags} = 6 (\text{Saturday}) + 3 (\text{Sunday}) = 9 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of cans
Since each bag contains 8 cans, we can calculate the total number of cans as follows:
\[ \text{Total Cans} = \text{Total Bags} \times \text{Cans per Bag} \]
\[ \text{Total Cans} = 9 \times 8 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ \text{Total Cans} = 72 \]

Therefore, Paul picked up a total of **72** cans.<|im_end|>",72

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Every 3 pounds of recycled paper earns 1 point.
   - Bianca recycled 24 pounds of paper.
   - Her friends recycled 3 pounds of paper.

2. **Calculate the number of points Bianca earned:**
   - Since she recycled 24 pounds and there are 3 pounds per point,
     \[
     \text{Points from Bianca} = \frac{24}{3} = 8
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of points her friends earned:**
   - Her friends recycled 3 pounds each.
   - There are two friends.
   - So, the total amount of paper her friends recycled is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pounds.
   - Therefore, her friends would earn \(\frac{6}{3} = 2\) points.

4. **Sum up all the points:**
   - Points from Bianca: 8
   - Points from her friends: 2
   - Total points: \(8 + 2 = 10\)

5. **Conclusion:**
   - They earned a total of 10 points.

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{10}\).<|im_end|>",9

   - The chef initially had 8 chicken wings.
   - They cooked an additional 10 more for the group.
   - Total number of chicken wings = 8 (initial) + 10 (additional) = 18.

2. **Calculate how many chicken wings each friend gets if they share equally:**
   - There are 3 friends in the group.
   - To find out how many chicken wings each person gets, divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of people.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of chicken wings per person} = \frac{\text{Total number of chicken wings}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{18}{3}

To determine how many socks John has after throwing some away and buying more, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of socks**: John starts with 33 socks.
2. **Socks thrown away**: He throws away 19 socks.
3. **New socks bought**: He buys 13 new socks.

Now let's calculate the total number of socks John will have after all these transactions.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Start with the initial number of socks**:
   \[
   \text{Initial number of socks} = 33
   \]

2. **Subtract the socks thrown away**:
   \[
   \text{Socks remaining after throwing away} = 33 - 19
   \]
   Let’s perform this subtraction first:
   \[
   33 - 19 = 14
   \]

3. **Add the new socks bought**:
   \[
   \text{Total number of socks} = 14 + 13
   \]
   Now add these together:
   \[
   14 + 13 = 27
   \]

Therefore, after throwing away 19 socks and buying 13 new ones, John would have a total of **27 socks**.<|im_end|>",27

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of tables that the waiter has based on the given conditions. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of customers who remained after some left.
Initially, there were 22 customers in the waiter's section.

Given:
- 14 customers left.
  
Therefore,
\[ \text{Remaining customers} = 22 - 14 = 8 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of tables needed if each table has exactly 4 people.
We know that the remaining customers are distributed evenly across the tables.

Given:
- Each table has 4 people.

Let \( T \) be the total number of tables. Since each table holds 4 people, we can write:
\[ 4T = 8 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \]

So, the waiter has **2** tables.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many clothes remain after putting some in one load:**
   - Roger starts with 120 pieces of clothing.
   - He puts 48 clothes in one load.

   \[
   120 - 48 = 72
   \]

   So, there are 72 pieces of clothing left that he needs to distribute among the remaining loads.

2. **Divide the remaining clothes equally among 9 loads:**
   - We have 72 pieces of clothing left to be distributed into 9 equal loads.

   \[
   \frac{72}{9} = 8
   \]

   Each of the 9 loads will contain 8 pieces of clothing.

3. **Verify the distribution:**
   - If each of the 9 loads contains 8 pieces of clothing, then the total number of pieces of clothing distributed should match the remaining ones.

   \[
   9 \times 8 = 72
   \]

   The calculation confirms that the distribution is correct.

Therefore, the number of pieces of clothing that can go into each of the small loads is 8.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of books left for Roger after the librarian takes some.

Roger starts with 14 books that he needs to put away. The librarian takes 2 out of these 14 books.

\[ \text{Books taken by the librarian} = 2 \]

Subtracting this from the initial count gives us the number of books left for Roger:

\[ \text{Books left for Roger} = 14 - 2 = 12 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many shelves Roger will need based on the number of books per shelf.

We know that Roger can fit 3 books on one shelf. To find out how many shelves he will need, we divide the total number of books left by the capacity of each shelf:

\[ \text{Number of shelves needed} = \frac{\text{Books left for Roger}}{\text{Books per shelf}} \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Number of shelves needed} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Roger will need **4 shelves** to store all his remaining books.<|im_end|>",4

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of shirts Dave needs to wash:**
   - Dave has 9 short sleeve shirts.
   - Dave also has 27 long sleeve shirts.
   
   Therefore, the total number of shirts Dave needs to wash = \( 9 + 27 \).

2. **Subtract the number of shirts that were already washed from the total number of shirts:**
   - According to the information given, Dave washed 20 shirts.

   So, we subtract these 20 shirts from the total number of shirts:

\[ 9 + 27 - 20 = 36 \]

This calculation shows that Dave needed to wash all 36 shirts.

3. **Determine how many shirts Dave didn't wash:**
   - Since Dave needed to wash 36 shirts in total but only washed 20 shirts,
   
   The number of shirts Dave didn't wash = Total number of shirts needed to be washed - Number of shirts washed.

Therefore,

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     While on , vacation, Haley took 50 pictures : at ! the zoo and ! 8 at . the museum. If she later deleted ! 38 , of the pictures, ? how many pictures . from her vacation did she still have? ? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pictures taken:**
   - Haley took 50 pictures.

2. **Determine how many pictures were deleted:**
   - She deleted 38 pictures.

3. **Subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining pictures} = \text{Total pictures} - \text{Deleted pictures}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining pictures} = 50 - 38
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining pictures} = 12
   \]

4. **Identify what part of the remaining pictures was not used for vacation purposes:**
   - We know that out of the 12 remaining pictures, 8 were taken at the zoo.
   - Therefore, the rest must be at the museum since only one type of location is mentioned.

5. **Verify the calculation:**
   - The remaining pictures (12) minus the ones taken at the zoo (8) should equal those taken at the museum:
     \[
     12 - 8 = 4
     \]
   - This means Haley has 4 pictures left that were not taken during her vacation.

6. **Conclude the answer:**
   - Since she had 12 pictures in total and 4 of them were not taken during her vacation, the number of pictures she still has from her vacation is:

Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine the total amount Mike earned from mowing lawns.
Mike made $42 from mowing lawns during the summer.

### Step 2: Subtract the cost of buying mower blades from his earnings.
He spent $10 on new mower blades.

\[ \text{Money after buying mower blades} = \$42 - \$10 \]

\[ \text{Money after buying mower blades} = \$32 \]

After spending $10 on mower blades, Mike has $32 remaining.

### Step 4: Determine how many $8 game sets he can afford with the remaining money.
To find out how many $8 game sets he can buy, we need to divide the remaining money by the price of one set.

\[ \text{Number of sets he can buy} = \frac{\$32}{\$8} \]

\[ \text{Number of sets he can buy} = 4 \]

To determine how long it will take the chef to cook the remaining potatoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of potatoes left to be cooked:**
   The total number of potatoes needed is 13. Since he has already cooked 5 potatoes, the number of potatoes still to be cooked is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ potatoes}
   \]

2. **Determine the time required to cook one potato:**
   Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

3. **Calculate the total cooking time for the remaining potatoes:**
   To find out how long it will take to cook the remaining 8 potatoes, multiply the number of potatoes by the time per potato:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Let's break down this problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of candies initially:**
   - Katie has 8 pieces.
   - Her sister has 23 pieces.
   
   Therefore, the total number of candies before eating any is:
   \[
   8 + 23 = 31 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. **Determine how many candies were eaten:**
   - They ate 8 pieces in the first night.

3. **Calculate the remaining number of candies after eating some:**
   - Subtract the number of candies eaten from the initial total:
   \[
   31 - 8 = 23 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of candy they have left is:

\[
\boxed{23}

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many puppies were left after selling.
2. Calculate how many cages are needed based on the number of remaining puppies.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Initial Puppies:** The pet store starts with 88 puppies.
2. **Puppies Sold:** They sell 34 puppies during the day.
3. **Remaining Puppies:** Subtract the sold puppies from the initial amount.
   \[
   88 - 34 = 54
   \]
   So, there are 54 puppies left.
4. **Cages Needed:** Each cage holds 6 puppies.
5. **Calculate Number of Cages Required:** Divide the remaining number of puppies by the number of puppies per cage.
   \[
   \frac{54}{6} = 9
   \]

Therefore, the pet store used 9 cages to house the remaining puppies.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of players on the baseball team.
- The team has 12 new players.
- The team also has 44 returning players.
  
\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{New players} + \text{Returning players} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 12 + 44 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 56 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many groups can be formed with 8 players per group.
- We need to divide the total number of players (56) by the number of players per group (8).

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total number of players}}{\text{Players per group}} \]
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{56}{8} \]

### Step 3: Perform the division.
\[ \text{Number of groups} = 7 \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can be formed is **7**.

### Conclusion:
There would be **7 groups** if the coach puts the players into groups with 8 players in each group.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total amount of money Will has initially**

Will started with $104.

**Step 2: Subtract the cost of the new mower blade from his initial amount**

He spent $41 on new mower blades.

So far, we have calculated that:
\[ \text{Money remaining} = \$104 - \$41 = \$63 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how much money he can spend on games**

Each game costs $9.

We need to find out how many games he can afford given the remaining money.

So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of games} = \frac{\$63}{\$9} \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost based on the given information.

1. **Identify the number of each type of flower purchased:**
   - Emily bought 2 roses.
   - Emily bought 2 daisies.

2. **Determine the price per flower:**
   - The price for each flower is $3.

3. **Calculate the cost for the roses:**
   - Number of roses = 2
   - Price per rose = $3
   - Total cost for roses = Number of roses × Price per rose
     \[
     \text{Total cost for roses} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost for the daisies:**
   - Number of daisies = 2
   - Price per daisy = $3
   - Total cost for daisies = Number of daisies × Price per daisy
     \[
     \text{Total cost for daisies} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Add the costs together to find the total amount spent:**
   - Cost for roses + Cost for daisies = Total amount spent
     \[
     \text{Total amount spent} = 6 \text{ dollars (roses)} + 6 \text{ dollars (daisies)} = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

**Final Answer:** Emily spent **$12** in total.<|im_end|>",12

                    question:
                    ?  A pet store had 13 , puppies. In one day they sold 7 , of them : and put the rest ? into cages ? with 2 ? in : each cage. How : many cages did they use? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many puppies were left after selling some:**
   - Start with the total number of puppies: 13.
   - Subtract the number of puppies sold: 7.
     \[
     13 - 7 = 6
     \]
   So, there are 6 puppies left.

2. **Divide the remaining puppies into cages, with each cage holding 2 puppies:**
   - We have 6 puppies left.
   - Each cage can hold 2 puppies.
   - To find out how many cages are needed, divide the total number of puppies (after selling) by the number of puppies per cage.
     \[
     \frac{6}{2} = 3
     \]

Therefore, the number of cages used is **3**.<|im_end|>",3

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of carrots picked.
- Faye picked 23 carrots.
- Her mother picked 5 carrots.

Total number of carrots = Faye's carrots + Mother's carrots
= 23 + 5
= 28 carrots

### Step 2: Calculate the number of good carrots.
- Only 12 out of the 28 carrots were good.

Number of good carrots = 12

### Step 3: Subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots to find the number of bad carrots.
- Number of bad carrots = Total number of carrots - Good carrots
= 28 - 12
= 16 carrots

Therefore, they had **16** bad carrots.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The final answer is 16.<|im_end|>",16

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Total Flowers Picked**: Isabel picked 66 flowers.

2. **Flowers Used per Bouquet**: Each bouquet uses 8 flowers.

3. **Wilted Flowers**: Before the wedding, 10 flowers wilted.

4. **Calculate Total Flowers Left**: First, we need to subtract the wilted flowers from the total number of flowers picked.
   - Total flowers left = 66 (picked) - 10 (wilted) = 56 flowers remaining.

5. **Calculate Number of Bouquets**: Now that we know there are 56 flowers left, we can divide this by the number of flowers used per bouquet.
   - Number of bouquets = 56 ÷ 8 = 7 bouquets.

Therefore, Isabel could still make 7 bouquets using the flowers available after accounting for the wilted ones.

Let's break down the information provided to find out how many pieces of winter clothing Zoe has in total.

1. **Identify the number of boxes**: Zoe found 8 boxes.
2. **Determine the number of items per box**:
    - Each box contains 4 scarves.
    - Each box also contains 6 mittens.
3. **Calculate the total number of items in one box**:
    - Total items per box = Scarves + Mittens
    - Total items per box = 4 scarves + 6 mittens
    - Total items per box = 10 (scarves and mittens combined)
4. **Calculate the total number of items for all boxes**:
    - Total items = Number of boxes × Items per box
    - Total items = 8 boxes × 10 items per box
    - Total items = 80 (pieces of winter clothing)

Therefore, Zoe has a total of 80 pieces of winter clothing.<|im_end|>",80

                    question:
                     Frank ? and ? his . friend ! were buying , trick . decks from the magic shop for 7 ! dollars each. How much did they spend , if Frank , bought 3 decks and , his friend bought 2 decks?

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost per deck.
2. Calculate how many decks Frank bought.
3. Calculate how many decks his friend bought.
4. Multiply the number of decks Frank bought by the cost per deck.
5. Multiply the number of decks his friend bought by the cost per deck.
6. Add the two amounts together.

Let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The cost per deck is given as $7.
   
2. Frank bought 3 decks. So, the amount he spent is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) dollars.

3. His friend bought 2 decks. So, the amount his friend spent is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) dollars.

4. Adding the amounts Frank and his friend spent gives us \(21 + 14 = 35\) dollars in total.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 35.<|im_end|>",35

                    question:
                     Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve ! shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts before school. . If he had only ; washed : 29 of them ; by the time school , started, how ! many , did ; he not wash? ; 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. First, let's determine the total number of shirts Sam has to wash.
   - He has 40 short sleeve shirts + 23 long sleeve shirts = 63 shirts in total.

2. Next, we need to understand when school starts based on what Sam has already washed.
   - We know that after washing 29 shirts, Sam still needs to wash some more.

3. To find out how many shirts Sam hasn't washed yet, we subtract the number of shirts he has already washed from the total number of shirts.
   
   - Total number of shirts: 63
   - Number of shirts washed: 29
   
   So, the calculation is: 63 - 29 = 34

Therefore, Sam has not washed 34 shirts.

Final answer: The final answer is 34.<|im_end|>",34

                    question:
                     ? A waiter ; had 47 ; customers to wait on. ; If 41 customers left and ; he got another 20 customers, how many customers ; would he ; have? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of customers
Initially, there were 47 customers.

### Step 2: Subtract the number of customers who left
If 41 customers left, we need to subtract these from the total number of customers initially present.
\[ \text{Customers remaining} = 47 - 41 \]

Performing the subtraction:
\[ 47 - 41 = 6 \]

So, after 41 customers leave, there are 6 customers left.

### Step 3: Add the new customers that arrived
After the previous calculation, the waiter received an additional 20 customers.
\[ \text{Total customers} = 6 + 20 \]

Performing the addition:
\[ 6 + 20 = 26 \]

Therefore, the total number of customers the waiter has at the end is **26**.

### Final Answer
The final answer is: The waiter would have 26 customers.<|im_end|>",26
