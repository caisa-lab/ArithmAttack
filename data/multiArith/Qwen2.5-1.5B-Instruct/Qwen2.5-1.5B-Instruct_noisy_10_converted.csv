                    question:
                     There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 26 , of them got called back, how many students didn't make ; the , cut? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how many students did not get called back to the school's basketball team, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of students who tried out:**
   - Number of girls = 39
   - Number of boys = 4
   - Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys
     \[
     \text{Total number of students} = 39 + 4 = 43
     \]

2. **Determine the number of students who got called back:**
   - Number of students called back = 26

3. **Subtract the number of students called back from the total number of students to find out how many did not get called back:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students who did not get called back} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Number of students called back}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of students who did not get called back} = 43 - 26 = 17
   \]

Therefore, the number of students who did not get called back is \(\boxed{17}\).<|im_end|>",17,17.0,17.0

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of coloring books Faye has:**
   - Faye initially has 34 coloring books.

2. **Calculate the number of coloring books after giving some away:**
   - Faye gives away 3 coloring books.
   - Therefore, the remaining number of coloring books is \( 34 - 3 \).

3. **Perform the subtraction:**
   \[
   34 - 3 = 31
   \]

So, after giving away 3 coloring books, Faye has 31 coloring books left.

4. **Calculate the total number of coloring books after buying more:**
   - Faye buys 48 more coloring books.
   - The new total number of coloring books is \( 31 + 48 \).

5. **Perform the addition:**

2. Calculate the total points based on the remaining enemies.

Step 1: Determine the number of enemies that have been destroyed.
- Total enemies in the level: 11
- Number of enemies left undestroyed: 3
- Therefore, the number of enemies destroyed = Total enemies - Enemies left undestroyed

Megan initially had 14 bags.

**Step 2: Determine how many bags were not recycled**

Out of these 14 bags, Megan did not recycle 5 bags.

**Step 3: Find out how many bags were recycled**

Since Megan did not recycle 5 bags, we subtract those from the total number of bags:

\[ 14 - 5 = 9 \]

So, Megan recycled 9 bags.

**Step 4: Calculate the total points Megan earned**

Megan earns 8 points for each bag she recycles. Therefore, if she recycled 9 bags, her total points would be:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of attendees:**
   - The company invited 47 people.
   - 7 people didn't show up.

   Therefore, the number of attendees who showed up is:
   \[
   47 - 7 = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of tables needed:**
   - Each table holds 5 people.
   - We have 40 attendees.

   To find out how many tables are required, we divide the total number of attendees by the capacity of one table:
   \[
   \frac{40}{5} = 8
   \]

3. **Verify the calculation:**
   - Since 8 tables can hold \(8 \times 5 = 40\) people, which matches our total number of attendees, our division is correct.

Therefore, the number of tables needed is \(\boxed{8}\).<|im_end|>",8,8.0,8.0

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of books Tom initially has:**
   - Tom starts with 5 books.

2. **Calculate the number of books Tom sells:**
   - Tom sells 4 books.

3. **Subtract the number of books sold from the initial number of books:**
   - Initial books = 5
   - Books sold = 4
   - Remaining books after selling = \( 5 - 4 \)

   \[
   5 - 4 = 1
   \]

   So, Tom has 1 book left after selling 4 books.

4. **Add the amount of money Tom earns from selling his books:**
   - Let's assume Tom sells each book for $2 (a common assumption in such problems).

   - Money earned from selling books = \( 4 \times 2 \)
   
   \[
   4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Use the money earned to buy new books:**
   - Tom uses the money to buy 38 new books.

6. **Subtract the cost of buying the new books from the remaining money:**
   - Cost per book = $2
   
   - Total cost for 38 books = \( 38 \times 2 \)
   
   \[
   38 \times 2 = 76 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   
   Since Tom only has $8, it means he cannot afford the full set of 38 books with just the money he earned from selling 4 books.

Therefore, Tom will not be able to buy any additional books with the money he earned from selling 4 books.

### Final Answer:
Tom will have 0 books because he cannot buy enough books with the money he earned from selling 4 books.<|im_end|>",39,39.0,4.0

                     A new building needed : 14 windows. The builder had already installed 8 of them. If it takes 8 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of windows still needing installation**
- Total windows required = 14
- Windows already installed = 8
- Remaining windows to be installed = Total windows - Windows already installed
\[ \text{Remaining windows} = 14 - 8 = 6 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total time required to install all windows**
- Time per window = 8 hours
- Total windows to be installed = 6
- Total time required (in hours) = Number of windows * Time per window
\[ \text{Total time required} = 6 \times 8 = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take the builder **48 hours** to install the remaining windows.<|im_end|>",48,48.0,48.0

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how much candy Faye has after eating some:**
   - Initially, Faye had 47 pieces of candy.
   - On the first night, she ate 25 pieces.
   
   To find out how much candy she has left after eating, we subtract the number of candies eaten from the initial amount:
   \[
   47 - 25 = 22
   \]
   So, after eating, Faye has 22 pieces of candy.

2. **Add the candy given by her sister:**
   - Her sister gives her an additional 40 pieces of candy.
   
   Now, we add the 40 pieces to what Faye has left:
   \[
   22 + 40 = 62

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pictures Wendy has left after putting some in an album.
2. Divide that number by the number of remaining albums.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pictures left for distribution.
- Wendy initially had 79 pictures.
- She put 44 pictures into one album.
- Therefore, the number of pictures left for distribution = Total pictures - Pictures put into one album = 79 - 44 = 35 pictures.

Step 2: Distribute the remaining pictures into 5 different albums.
- We have 35 pictures left and need to distribute them equally among 5 albums.
- So, divide the total number of pictures left by the number of albums: 35 ÷ 5 = 7 pictures per album.

Therefore, each album contains 7 pictures.

Final Answer: The final answer is: The number of pictures in each album is 7.<|im_end|>",7,7.0,7.0

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many roses were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the number of roses sold.

Step 1: Determine how many roses were sold.
April started with 9 roses and had 4 roses left after the sale. Therefore, the number of roses sold is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of roses sold} = \text{Initial number of roses} - \text{Number of roses left} \]
\[ \text{Number of roses sold} = 9 - 4 = 5 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings.
Each rose costs $7. Therefore, if April sold 5 roses, her total earnings can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of roses sold} \times \text{Price per rose} \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5 \times 7 = 35 \]

Therefore, the amount of money April earned from selling the roses is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of members who showed up for the game**

- Total number of members on the trivia team = 11
- Number of members who didn't show up = 6
- Therefore, the number of members who showed up = Total members - Members who didn't show up

\[ \text{Members who showed up} = 11 - 6 = 5 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total points scored by those who showed up**

- Each member who showed up scores 9 points.
- Since there are 5 members who showed up, we multiply the number of members who showed up by the points per member.

\[ \text{Total points scored} = \text{Number of members who showed up} \times \text{Points per member} \]
\[ \text{Total points scored} = 5 \times 9 \]
\[ \text{Total points scored} = 45 \]

Therefore, the total number of points scored by the trivia team is **45**.<|im_end|>",45,45.0,45.0

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of players before any additional players joined.
2. Add the number of additional players who joined.
3. Calculate the total number of players after the addition.
4. Multiply the total number of players by the number of lives per player.

Step 1: Initially, there were 2 friends playing the game. So, we start with 2 players.

Step 2: Two more players joined the game. Therefore, we add 2 to the initial count.

Total players = Initial players + Additional players
               = 2 + 2
               = 4

Step 3: Now, we calculate the total number of players after the addition.

Total players = 4 (after adding the two new players)

Step 4: Each player has 6 lives. To find out the total number of lives, we multiply the total number of players by the number of lives per player.

Total lives = Total players × Lives per player
             = 4 × 6
             = 24

Therefore, the total number of lives is 24.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Adam made from selling his books**

Adam initially has 48 books. He sells 19 of them.

Money made = Number of books sold × Price per book

Since the price per book isn't specified in the problem, let's assume that Adam gets $2 for each book he sells (a common practice).

So, Money made = 19 × $2 = $38

**Step 2: Determine how much Adam spent on buying new books**

Adam uses the money he earned from selling his books ($38) to buy 38 new books.

Price per new book = Money spent ÷ Number of new books bought

Therefore,

Price per new book = $38 ÷ 38 = $1

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of books Adam has after the transaction**

Initially, Adam had 48 books. After selling 19, he now has 48 - 19 = 29 books left.

He then buys 38 new books.

Final number of books = Books remaining + New books bought

Final number of books = 29 + 38 = 67

                    question:
                     The ? cafeteria had 96 apples. For lunch they handed out 42 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 6 apples, how many pies could they make? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many pies can be made from the remaining apples after distributing some to students, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of apples left after distribution:**
   - The cafeteria started with 96 apples.
   - They gave out 42 apples to students.
   - Subtract the number of apples given away from the total number of apples:
     \[
     96 - 42 = 54
     \]
   So, there are 54 apples left for making pies.

2. **Calculate how many pies can be made using the remaining apples:**
   - Each pie requires 6 apples.
   - Divide the number of remaining apples (54) by the number of apples needed per pie (6):
     \[
     \frac{54}{6} = 9
     \]

Therefore, they can make 9 pies with the remaining apples.

To determine how many books Roger has after his transactions, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of books Roger sells**

Roger initially had 25 books. He sold 21 of those books.

\[ \text{Books sold} = 21 \]

**Step 2: Subtract the books sold from the initial total**

Subtract the number of books sold from the initial count:

\[ \text{Remaining books} = 25 - 21 \]

So, after selling 21 books, Roger has 4 books left.

**Step 3: Add the new books bought**

Roger then uses the money he earned from selling the books to buy 30 more books.

\[ \text{New books bought} = 30 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of books Roger now owns**

Add the remaining books (from Step 2) and the newly purchased books (from Step 3):

                    question:
                     Frank ! made 19 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 11 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 2 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Frank has after spending on mower blades.
Frank initially made $19 from mowing lawns.

Step 2: Subtract the cost of the mower blades from his initial earnings.
$19 - $11 = $8

Step 3: Determine how much money Frank has left after purchasing the mower blades.
After spending $11 on mower blades, Frank has $8 remaining.

Step 4: Calculate how many games Frank can buy with the remaining money.
Each game costs $2.

Step 5: Divide the remaining money by the price per game to find out how many games he can afford.
$8 ÷ $2 = 4

Therefore, Frank can buy 4 games with the money he has left.

The final answer is: The final answer is 4.<|im_end|>",4,4.0,4.0

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of players:**
   - The baseball team has 48 new players.
   - They also have 6 returning players.
   
2. **Calculate the total number of players:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of new players} + \text{Number of returning players}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Total number of players} = 48 + 6 = 54
   \]

3. **Divide the total number of players by the number of players per group:**
   - Each group contains 6 players.
   - We need to find out how many such groups can be formed.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many folders Nancy ended up with after deleting some files and organizing the remaining ones, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of files left after deletion:**
   - Nancy originally had 80 files.
   - She deleted 31 files.
   - Therefore, the number of files left = \( 80 - 31 \).

2. **Subtract the deleted files from the original total:**
   \[
   80 - 31 = 49
   \]

   So, Nancy has 49 files left.

3. **Determine how many folders she can create with 7 files per folder:**
   - Each folder contains 7 files.
   - To find out how many folders she can fill completely, divide the number of remaining files by the number of files per folder.
   \[
   \frac{49}{7} = 7
   \]

   Thus, Nancy can create 7 full folders.

Therefore, the final answer is that Nancy ends up with \(\boxed{7}\) folders.<|im_end|>",7,7.0,7.0

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many games Luke has left after selling some.
2. Calculate how many boxes are needed to pack those remaining games.

Let's start with the first step:

Step 1: Calculate the number of games left after selling.
Luke initially had 39 games. He sold 19 games. So, we subtract the number of games sold from the initial amount:

\[ \text{Remaining games} = 39 - 19 \]

Calculating this gives us:

\[ \text{Remaining games} = 20 \]

Next, let's move on to the second step:

Step 2: Calculate how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games.
We know that Luke packs 4 games per box. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of remaining games by the number of games per box:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Remaining games}}{\text{Games per box}} \]

Substituting in our numbers:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{20}{4} \]

Performing this division:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = 5 \]

Therefore, Luke used **5** boxes to pack the remaining games.

2. **Calculate the number of students who got picked:**
   \[
   65 - 17 = 48
   \]
   So, 48 students got picked.

3. **Divide the number of picked students by the number of groups:**
   - The remaining 48 students need to be divided among 8 groups.
   
4. **Perform the division:**

<|im_start|>system
To determine how long the money Mike has will last, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Mike earned.**
Mike earned $14 from mowing lawns and $26 from weed eating.
Total earnings = $14 + $26

Let's add these amounts together:
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$14 + \$26 \]

Performing the addition:
\[ \$14 + \$26 = \$40 \]

So, Mike has a total of $40.

**Step 2: Determine how much Mike spends per week.**
Mike spends $5 per week.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks the money will last.**
To find out how many weeks his money will last, divide the total amount of money by the weekly spending amount.

Number of weeks = Total Money ÷ Weekly Spending Amount
\[ \text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{\$40}{\$5} \]

Now, perform the division:
\[ \frac{\$40}{\$5} = 8 \]

So, Mike's money will last for 8 weeks.

\[ \text{Total number of books} = 32 + 37 = 69 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of books that were not used**
Given that 16 books were used, we subtract this from the total number of books.
\[ \text{Books not used} = 69 - 16 = 53 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the number of books that were used from the total number of books purchased**
Since all books were either used or new (new books are those not used), we can directly find out how many new books Victor bought by subtracting the number of used books from the total number of books purchased.
\[ \text{Number of new books} = 32 + 37 - 16 = 53 \]

Therefore, Victor bought **53 new books** at the book fair.

\[
\boxed{53}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine the initial number of carrots picked**
Maria initially picked 48 carrots.

**Step 2: Subtract the number of carrots thrown out**
She threw out 11 carrots, so we subtract that from the initial count:
\[ 48 - 11 = 37 \]

After throwing out 11 carrots, Maria has 37 carrots left.

**Step 3: Add the carrots picked on the second day**
On the next day, she picked an additional 15 carrots.
So, we add those to the remaining carrots:
\[ 37 + 15 = 52 \]

Therefore, after picking more carrots on the next day, Maria will have **52 carrots** in total.<|im_end|>",52,52.0,52.0

2. Calculate how much money Adam makes from selling those books.
3. Use that money to buy new books.
4. Add the number of new books bought to the remaining books after selling.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Determine how many books Adam sells.
Adam originally has 33 books. He decides to sell 11 of them.

\[ \text{Books sold} = 11 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how much money Adam makes from selling those books.

Let \( x \) represent the number of cupcakes Carol sold after selling 6.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
Given that Carol started with 19 cupcakes and ended up with 27 more than she originally had, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 19 - (6 + x) = 27 \]

Here, \( 6 + x \) represents the total number of cupcakes sold before making 27 more, which equals the number of cupcakes left after selling 6.

### Step 3: Simplify the Equation
First, simplify inside the parentheses:

\[ 19 - 6 - x = 27 \]
\[ 13 - x = 27 \]

Now, isolate \( x \):

\[ 13 - x = 27 \]
\[ 13 - 27 = x \]
\[ x = -14 \]

Since \( x \) cannot be negative in this context, there seems to be an error or misunderstanding in the setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement.

### Step 4: Re-evaluate Problem Statement
If Carol initially had 19 cupcakes and sold 6, we need to find out how many more she needs to sell to reach 27 cupcakes in total.

Let’s denote the number of additional cupcakes sold as \( y \).

So, the equation should be:

\[ 19 - 6 + y = 27 \]

Simplify this:

\[ 13 + y = 27 \]

Isolate \( y \):

\[ y = 27 - 13 \]
\[ y = 14 \]

Carol would need to sell **14 more cupcakes** to make a total of 27 cupcakes.

### Final Answer
Therefore, the final answer is: Carol would have sold 14 more cupcakes.<|im_end|>",40,40.0,14.0

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time required for the remaining rooms after the painter has already completed 2 rooms.

1. **Determine the total number of rooms:**
   The painter needs to paint 6 rooms.

2. **Calculate the total painting time:**
   It takes 5 hours to paint one room. Therefore, for 6 rooms, the total time would be:
   \[
   6 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ hours/room} = 30 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time already spent on the first 2 rooms:**

                    question:
                     In fourth grade ; there were 10 students ? at the start of the year. During the year 4 students : left and 42 new students came to , school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of students**: At the start of the year, there were 10 students.
2. **Students who left**: During the year, 4 students left the school.
3. **New students who joined**: During the same period, 42 new students joined the school.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students at the end of the year:

- Start: 10 students
- Subtract the students who left: \(10 - 4 = 6\)
- Add the new students who joined: \(6 + 42 = 48\)

Therefore, the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year is \(\boxed{48}\).<|im_end|>",48,48.0,48.0

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers Bianca initially picked.
Bianca picked 39 tulips and 49 roses.

\[ \text{Total flowers} = 39 (\text{tulips}) + 49 (\text{roses}) \]

Perform the addition:

\[ 39 + 49 = 88 \]

So, Bianca initially picked **88** flowers.

### Step 2: Determine how many flowers were actually used.
According to the information given, Bianca used 81 flowers.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of extra flowers.
To find out how many extra flowers Bianca picked beyond what was used, we subtract the number of flowers used from the initial number of flowers picked.

\[ \text{Extra flowers} = \text{Initial flowers} - \text{Used flowers} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ \text{Extra flowers} = 88 - 81 \]

Perform the subtraction:

\[ 88 - 81 = 7 \]

Therefore, Bianca picked **7 extra flowers**.<|im_end|>",7,7.0,7.0

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of sodas:**
   - Cody bought 4 regular sodas.
   - Cody also bought 44 diet sodas.
   - Total number of sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
     \[
     4 + 44 = 48 \text{ sodas}
     \]

2. **Determine how many shelves are needed if each shelf holds 6 sodas:**
   - We need to divide the total number of sodas by the capacity per shelf (which is 6) to find out how many full shelves can be filled.
   - To do this division, we use long division or simply perform the calculation:
     \[
     48 \div 6 = 8
     \]
   - This means that 8 shelves will be completely filled.

3. **Verify the result:**
   - Each shelf can hold 6 sodas, so 8 shelves will indeed hold \(8 \times 6 = 48\) sodas, which matches our total count.

Therefore, Cody would fill up **8** shelves.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for the flowers purchased by Vanessa. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the cost per flower**: Each flower (in this case, both roses and daisies) costs $8.

2. **Calculate the total number of flowers**:
   - Vanessa bought 3 roses.
   - Vanessa also bought 3 daisies.
   
   Therefore, the total number of flowers is \(3 \text{ roses} + 3 \text{ daisies} = 6 \text{ flowers}\).

3. **Calculate the total cost for all flowers**:
   - Since each flower costs $8, the total cost for 6 flowers is \(6 \times 8 = \$48\).

So, the amount Vanessa spent on her purchase is $\boxed{48}$.<|im_end|>",48,48.0,48.0

                    question:
                     Olivia uploaded 5 ! pictures from her phone and 35 ; from her camera to facebook. , If she sorted ; the pics into 8 different albums with the ; same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of photos**: Olivia uploaded 5! pictures from her phone and 35; from her camera. We first need to calculate the factorial of 5 (which represents the number of ways she could have arranged those photos).

   \[
   5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
   \]

   So, she has a total of \(120 + 35 = 155\) photos.

2. **Divide the total number of photos equally among the albums**: Olivia wants to sort all the photos into 8 different albums with an equal number of photos in each.

   To find out how many photos will be in each album, divide the total number of photos by the number of albums:

   \[
   \frac{155}{8} = 19.375
   \]

Since the number of photos must be a whole number, it's not possible to evenly distribute 155 photos into 8 albums without some leftover photos.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 19 or 20 depending on whether we round up or down. However, since we can't split photos between albums, we'll round down if we're considering practical distribution. Hence, each album would contain 19 photos, but there will be 1 photo left over that cannot be distributed.<|im_end|>",5,5.0,1.0

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of cookies:**
   - Robin has 23 chocolate chip cookies.
   - Robin also has 25 oatmeal cookies.

   Adding these together gives us the total number of cookies:
   \[
   23 + 25 = 48 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of baggies based on the cookie count per baggie:**
   - Each baggie contains 6 cookies.

   To find out how many baggies can be made from 48 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per baggie:
   \[
   \frac{48}{6} = 8 \text{ baggies}
   \]

Therefore, Robin can make 8 baggies of cookies.

**Step 3: Spending money**
Cody then spent $19 on a new game.
We subtract this from his current total:
\[ 54 - 19 = 35 \]

Therefore, after spending the money on the game, Cody has **$35 left**.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Pictures Uploaded**:
   - Wendy uploaded 22 pictures from her phone.
   - She also uploaded 2 pictures from her camera.

   Therefore, the total number of pictures uploaded = 22 (phone) + 2 (camera) = 24 pictures.

2. **Dividing the Pictures into Albums**:
   - The total number of pictures (24) needs to be evenly distributed among 4 different albums.

3. **Calculating Pics per Album**:
   To find out how many pictures will go into each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

   \[
   \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{\text{Total pictures}}{\text{Number of albums}}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{24}{4}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine if Will can buy 9-dollar games after spending on mower blades, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount Will has after buying mower blades**
- Will initially had $104.
- He spent $41 on mower blades.

\[
\text{Money left} = \text{Initial Amount} - \text{Spent on Mower Blades}
\]

Substitute the given values into the equation:

\[
\text{Money left} = 104 - 41
\]

Calculate this:

\[
\text{Money left} = 63
\]

So, after buying mower blades, Will has $63 remaining.

**Step 2: Determine if Will can afford 9-dollar games with his remaining money**

We need to check if $63 is sufficient for 9-dollar games.

Divide the remaining money by the cost per game:

\[
\text{Number of Games} = \frac{\text{Money Left}}{\text{Cost per Game}}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Number of Games} = \frac{63}{9}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
\text{Number of Games} = 7
\]

Since Will has enough money (after buying mower blades) to purchase 7 games at $9 each, he can indeed buy 9-dollar games.

**Final Answer:** Yes, Will can buy 9-dollar games with the money he has left.<|im_end|>",7,7.0,9.0

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of problems in one worksheet**
- We know that there are 4 problems on one worksheet.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of problems across all worksheets**
- The teacher has 16 worksheets.
- Therefore, the total number of problems = Number of problems per worksheet × Total number of worksheets
= 4 problems/worksheet × 16 worksheets
= 64 problems

**Step 3: Determine how many problems the teacher has already graded**
- The teacher has already graded 8 problems.

**Step 4: Subtract the number of graded problems from the total number of problems**
- To find out how many more problems the teacher needs to grade, subtract the number of graded problems from the total number of problems.
= Total number of problems - Graded problems
= 64 problems - 8 problems
= 56 problems

Therefore, the teacher still has 56 problems left to grade.

                    question:
                     Paige was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 6 boxes ; of clothing and inside each . box there were 5 scarves and 5 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Paige have total? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of winter clothing Paige has after opening all six boxes.

1. **Identify the number of items per box:**
   - Each box contains 5 scarves and 5 mittens.
   
2. **Calculate the total number of items in one box:**
   \[
   \text{Items per box} = 5 \text{ (scarves)} + 5 \text{ (mittens)}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Items per box} = 10 \text{ items}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of items across all six boxes:**
   \[
   \text{Total items} = 6 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ items/box}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total items} = 60 \text{ items}
   \]

4. **Verify the calculation by summing up the items in each box:**
   - For one box: \(5 \text{ scarves} + 5 \text{ mittens} = 10 \text{ items}\)
   - Since there are 6 boxes, multiply the items in one box by 6:
     \[
     10 \text{ items/box} \times 6 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ items}
     \]

Thus, the total number of pieces of winter clothing Paige has is:

To determine how long it will take the chef to cook the remaining potatoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of potatoes still needed:**
   - Total potatoes needed = 12
   - Potatoes already cooked = 6
   - Remaining potatoes = 12 - 6 = 6

2. **Determine the time required for one potato to cook:**
   - Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

3. **Calculate the total cooking time for the remaining potatoes:**
   - Number of remaining potatoes = 6
   - Time per potato = 6 minutes

2. **Puppies sold**: They sold 7 puppies during that day.
   
   - Subtract the sold puppies from the initial total: \( 13 - 7 = 6 \)

   So, after selling, there are 6 puppies left.

3. **Puppies per cage**: Each cage holds 2 puppies.

4. **Number of cages needed**: To find out how many cages were used to hold the remaining puppies, we divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage.

3. Subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots to find the number of bad carrots.

Step 1: Determine the total number of carrots picked.
- Faye picked 23 carrots.
- Her mother picked 5 carrots.
- Total number of carrots = 23 + 5 = 28 carrots.

Step 2: Calculate the number of good carrots.
- Only 12 of the carrots are good.

Step 3: Subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots to find the number of bad carrots.
- Number of bad carrots = Total number of carrots - Number of good carrots

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how many bouquets Isabel can still make after some flowers wilted, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bouquets Isabel originally planned to make:**
   - Isabel picked 66 flowers.
   - Each bouquet contains 8 flowers.

\[
\text{Number of bouquets} = \frac{\text{Total number of flowers}}{\text{Flowers per bouquet}} = \frac{66}{8}
\]

2. **Simplify the division:**

\[
\frac{66}{8} = 8 \text{ bouquets with a remainder}
\]

So, Isabel can initially make 8 bouquets with 4 flowers left over (since \(66 \div 8 = 8\) with a remainder).

3. **Account for the flowers that wilted:**
   - Isabel has 10 flowers that wilted.

Since the 10 wilted flowers do not affect the remaining flowers used in the bouquets, we only consider the original count of flowers available for making more bouquets.

4. **Determine how many additional bouquets Isabel can still make:**
   - With 4 flowers left over from the initial 66 flowers, she can now form new bouquets using these leftover flowers.

\[
\text{Additional bouquets} = \frac{\text{Remaining flowers}}{\text{Flowers per bouquet}} = \frac{4}{8}
\]

5. **Simplify the division again:**

\[
\frac{4}{8} = 0.5
\]

This indicates that Isabel cannot form any more bouquets since she does not have enough flowers left to even start forming another bouquet.

**Final Answer:** Isabel can still make 0 additional bouquets. The final answer is:

   - Subtract these 5 apples from the total: \( 50 - 5 = 45 \) apples.

2. **Calculate how many pies can be made using the remaining apples:**
   - Each pie requires 5 apples.
   - Divide the remaining apples (45) by the number of apples needed per pie (5): \( 45 \div 5 = 9 \).

So, the cafeteria could make 9 pies with the remaining apples.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 9 pies.<|im_end|>",9,9.0,9.0

To determine Frank's final score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of questions Frank answered correctly.
2. Multiply that number by the point value per question.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of questions answered correctly**
Frank answered 3 questions in the first half and 2 questions in the second half. So, the total number of questions he answered correctly is:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the final score**
Each question is worth 3 points. Therefore, if Frank answered 5 questions correctly, his final score would be:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

So, Frank's final score is \( \boxed{15} \).<|im_end|>",15,15.0,15.0

<|im_start|>user
To determine the total number of pieces of winter clothing Zoe has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of items in one box.
2. Multiply that number by the total number of boxes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of items in one box.
Each box contains 4 scarves + 6 mittens = 10 pieces of winter clothing.

Step 2: Multiply the number of items per box by the total number of boxes.
Since Zoe found 8 boxes, we multiply 10 (pieces per box) by 8 (total boxes).

\[ 10 \text{ pieces/box} \times 8 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Zoe has a total of 80 pieces of winter clothing.<|im_end|>",80,80.0,80.0

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by both Frank and his friend on the deck purchases.

Step 1: Calculate the cost for Frank's purchase.
Frank buys 3 decks at $7 per deck.
\[ \text{Cost for Frank} = 3 \times \$7 = \$21 \]

Step 2: Calculate the cost for his friend's purchase.
His friend buys 2 decks at $7 per deck.
\[ \text{Cost for Friend} = 2 \times \$7 = \$14 \]

Step 3: Add the costs together to find the total amount spent.
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$21 + \$14 = \$35 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of shirts Sam has:**
   - Sam has 40 short sleeve shirts.
   - Sam has 23 long sleeve shirts.
   
   Therefore, the total number of shirts is:
   \[
   40 + 23 = 63
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of shirts Sam still needs to wash:**
   - Sam has already washed 29 shirts.
   - The total number of shirts is 63.

   So, the number of shirts Sam still needs to wash is:
   \[
   63 - 29 = 34
   \]

3. **Identify the number of shirts that were not washed:**
   - Since Sam has 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts, all of these shirts have been washed.

   Thus, the number of shirts that were not washed is:
   \[
   40 (short sleeves) + 23 (long sleeves) = 63
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 34.<|im_end|>",34,34.0,34.0

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the initial number of customers.
The waiter initially had 47 customers.

Step 2: Subtract the number of customers who left from the total.
Since 41 customers left, we subtract that from the initial count:
\[ 47 - 41 = 6 \]

Step 3: Add the number of new customers.
After some time, the waiter received an additional 20 customers.
So, we add those 20 customers to the remaining count:
\[ 6 + 20 = 26 \]

Therefore, after all transactions, the waiter would have **26** customers waiting on him.<|im_end|>",26,26.0,26.0
