                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Sure! Let's break this down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial Number of Songs**:
   - Paige starts with 11 songs on her MP3 player.
   
2. **Deleting Old Songs**:
   - Paige deletes 9 old songs.
   - To find out how many songs are left after deleting these, we subtract 9 from the initial number of songs (11):
     \[
     11 - 9 = 2
     \]
   - After deleting 9 songs, Paige has 2 songs remaining.

3. **Adding New Songs**:
   - Paige then adds 8 new songs to her collection.
   - To find out how many songs there are now, we add 8 to the number of songs left after deletion:
     \[
     2 + 8 = 10
     \]
   - After adding 8 new songs, Paige has 10 songs in total.

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of participants:**
   - There are 39 girls.
   - There are 4 boys.
   - Total participants = Number of girls + Number of boys
   \[
   \text{Total participants} = 39 + 4 = 43
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of people who made it to the call:**
   - Only 26 students got called back.

3. **Find the number of students who did not get called back:**
   - Subtract the number of students called back from the total number of participants.
   \[
   \text{Students who didn't make it} = \text{Total participants} - \text{Students called back}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Students who didn't make it} = 43 - 26 = 17
   \]

Therefore, the number of students who did not make it to the call is **17**.<|im_end|>",17,17.0,17.0

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Points per Enemy**: Each enemy defeated gives you 9! points.
   - Calculation: \(9! = 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 362880\).

2. **Total Enemies in Level**: The level has 11 enemies.

3. **Enemies Destroyed**: According to the problem, you destroy all but 3 enemies.

Now, let's calculate the number of points earned:

- Number of enemies destroyed = Total enemies - (All but 3)
- Points from destroyed enemies = Number of enemies destroyed × Points per enemy

First, find out how many enemies were destroyed:
\[ \text{Destroyed} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

Then, calculate the points:
\[ \text{Points} = 8 \times 9! \]
\[ \text{Points} = 8 \times 362880 \]
\[ \text{Points} = 2903040 \]

So, if you destroy all but 3 enemies, you would earn **2,903,040** points.<|im_end|>",72,72.0,2903040.0

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of shirts Ned needs to wash:**
   - Ned has to wash 9 short sleeve shirts.
   - Ned also has to wash 21 long sleeve shirts.

2. **Calculate the total number of shirts Ned needs to wash:**
   \[
   \text{Total shirts} = 9 + 21 = 30
   \]

3. **Determine the fraction of shirts that Ned has already washed:**
   - Ned has washed 29 out of 30 shirts.

4. **Calculate the fraction of shirts that Ned still needs to wash:**
   \[
   \text{Fraction still to be washed} = 1 - \frac{29}{30}
   \]

5. **Simplify the fraction:**
   \[
   \frac{29}{30} = 0.9667 (approximately)
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   1 - 0.9667 = 0.0333 (approximately)
   \]

6. **Convert the fraction back to a percentage:**
   \[
   0.0333 \times 100\% = 3.33\%
   \]

7. **Find the number of shirts Ned didn't wash:**
   - Since \(3.33\%\) of the shirts were not washed, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of shirts not washed} = 30 \times 3.33\% = 30 \times 0.0333 = 1

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of attendees who did not show up:**
   - The total number of invitations was 47.
   - Out of these, 7 did not show up.

2. **Calculate the number of people who actually attended:**
   \[
   \text{Number of attendees} = \text{Total invitations} - \text{People who did not show up}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of attendees} = 47 - 7 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine the capacity per table:**
   - Each table can hold 5 people.

4. **Calculate the number of tables needed:**
   - We divide the total number of attendees by the capacity per table:
   \[
   \text{Number of tables} = \frac{\text{Number of attendees}}{\text{Capacity per table}}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of books left for Mike.
- Total number of books = 82
- Number of books taken by the librarian = 10
- Books left for Mike = Total - Taken = 82 - 10 = 72

### Step 2: Calculate how many shelves are needed if each shelf holds 9 books.
- Books per shelf = 9
- Shelves required = Books left / Books per shelf = 72 / 9 = 8

### Conclusion:
Mike needs **8** shelves.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Total Pictures Taken:**
   - Nancy took 49 pictures at the zoo.
   - She also took 8 pictures at the museum.

2. **Calculate Total Pictures Taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total Pictures} = 49 + 8 = 57
   \]

3. **Pictures Deleted:**
   - Nancy deleted 38% of the total pictures taken.

4. **Calculate Number of Pictures Deleted:**
   \[
   \text{Number of Pictures Deleted} = 0.38 \times 57 = 21.66
   \]
   Since we can't delete a fraction of a picture, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. For simplicity, let's assume the problem allows for fractional deletions or consider it as approximately 22 pictures (if rounding up).

5. **Calculate Remaining Pictures:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Pictures} = 57 - 22 = 35
   \]

Therefore, Nancy still has **35** pictures from her vacation.<|im_end|>",19,19.0,35.0

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Total number of windows**: The builder needs to install 14 windows.
2. **Windows already installed**: He has already installed 8 windows.
3. **Remaining windows to be installed**: \( 14 - 8 = 6 \) windows.

Now, we need to calculate the time required to install these remaining 6 windows.

4. **Time per window**: It takes 8 hours to install one window.
5. **Time for 6 windows**:
   - Time for one window: 8 hours
   - Time for six windows: \( 6 \times 8 \) hours

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

Therefore, it will take him 48 hours to install the remaining 6 windows.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of oranges**: The store initially has 40 oranges.
   
2. **Oranges thrown away**:
   - They throw away 25% of the old oranges.
   - Calculate 25% of 40:
     \[
     0.25 \times 40 = 10
     \]
   - So, they throw away 10 oranges.

3. **Remaining oranges after throwing away some**:
   - Subtract the 10 oranges from the initial count:
     \[
     40 - 10 = 30
     \]

4. **New oranges added**:
   - They add 21 new oranges to the remaining oranges.
   - Add these new oranges to the current total:

   - Total number of customers = 7
   - Number of customers who didn't tip = 5
   - Therefore, the number of customers who did tip = Total customers - Customers who didn't tip
     \[
     \text{Customers who tipped} = 7 - 5 = 2
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount earned from tips:**
   - Each customer who tipped received $3.
   - There were 2 customers who tipped.
   - Therefore, the total amount earned from tips = Number of customers who tipped × Amount per tipper

   - There are 9 windows in the building.

2. **Calculate the number of remaining windows after installation:**
   - The builder has already installed 6 out of 9 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of remaining windows = \( 9 - 6 = 3 \).

3. **Calculate the time required to install the remaining windows:**
   - It takes 6 hours to install one window.
   - For 3 more windows, the time required would be \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) hours.

4. **Add up all the time taken for installation:**
   - Time taken to install the first 6 windows = 6 hours.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided and reason through it step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total number of people:**
   - There are 13 people in total.

2. **Determine the number of adults:**
   - Since there are 9 children, we can find the number of adults by subtracting the number of children from the total number of people.
     \[
     \text{Number of adults} = \text{Total number of people} - \text{Number of children}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of adults} = 13 - 9 = 4
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost for the adults:**
   - Each adult meal costs $7.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the adults' meals is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the price per meal.
     \[
     \text{Cost for adults} = \text{Number of adults} \times \text{Price per meal}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost for adults} = 4 \times 7 = 28
     \]

4. **Determine the cost for the children:**
   - For children, the meal is free, so their total cost is $0.

5. **Sum up the total cost for the group:**
   - Add the cost for the adults to the cost for the children.
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for adults} + \text{Cost for children}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 28 + 0 = 28

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of problems Paige has.
Paige has two types of problems: math and science.

- Math problems = 43
- Science problems = 12

Total problems = Math problems + Science problems
= 43 + 12
= 55 problems

### Step 2: Calculate the fraction of problems that Paige completed.
Paige finished 44 out of these 55 problems.

Fraction of problems completed = (Number of problems completed) / (Total number of problems)
= 44 / 55

Simplify the fraction:
= 4/5

This means Paige completed 80% of her problems.

### Step 3: Determine how many problems she still needs to complete.
Since she completed 44 problems out of 55, we can calculate the remaining problems as follows:

Remaining problems = Total problems - Problems completed
= 55 - 44
= 11 problems

Therefore, Paige still needed to do **11** more problems for her homework.

To determine how many shelves were used to display the bears, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bears:**
   - Initially, there were 17 bears.
   - They received an additional shipment containing 10 more bears.
   
   Therefore, the total number of bears is:
   \[
   17 + 10 = 27 \text{ bears}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of bears per shelf:**
   - Each shelf holds 9 bears.

3. **Calculate the total number of shelves needed:**
   - To find out how many shelves are required for 27 bears, where each shelf can hold up to 9 bears, we divide the total number of bears by the capacity of one shelf.
   
   \[
   \frac{27}{9} = 3 \text{ shelves}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the type of books:**
   - We need to determine the number of mystery books and picture books.
   - The rest will be regular books.

2. **Calculate the number of mystery books:**
   - Gwen has 5 shelves dedicated to mysteries.
   - Each shelf contains exactly 4 books.
   - Therefore, the total number of mystery books = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \).

3. **Calculate the number of picture books:**
   - Gwen has 3 shelves dedicated to picture books.
   - Each shelf contains exactly 4 books.
   - Therefore, the total number of picture books = \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \).

4. **Determine the number of regular books:**
   - Total shelves = 5 (mystery) + 3 (picture) = 8 shelves.
   - Each shelf must contain exactly 4 books.
   - Therefore, the total number of regular books = \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \).

5. **Sum up all the books:**
   - Mystery books: 20
   - Picture books: 12
   - Regular books: 32
   - Total number of books = \( 20 + 12 + 32 = 64 \).

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Total number of pictures**: Wendy has uploaded 79 pictures.

2. **Pictures put into an album**:
   - Wendy put 44 pictures into one album.
   
3. **Remaining pictures**:
   - After putting 44 pictures into one album, the remaining number of pictures is:
     \[
     79 - 44 = 35
     \]

4. **Number of different albums**:
   - The problem states that Wendy put the remaining pictures into ""5 different albums.""

5. **Pictures per album**:
   - To find out how many pictures are in each of the 5 albums, we divide the total remaining pictures (35) by the number of albums (5):
     \[
     \frac{35}{5} = 7
     \]
   - So, there are 7 pictures in each album.

6. **Final check**:
   - We can verify our solution by adding up the pictures in all five albums:
     \[
     7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 35
     \]
   - This confirms that the calculation is correct.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many vans are required for both students and adults, given that each van can carry 5 people.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of people:**
   - Number of students = 12
   - Number of adults = 3
   - Total number of people = Students + Adults
     \[
     \text{Total number of people} = 12 + 3 = 15
     \]

2. **Determine how many vans are needed based on capacity:**
   - Each van can hold 5 people.
   - To find out how many vans are needed, divide the total number of people by the van capacity.
     \[
     \text{Number of vans needed} = \frac{\text{Total number of people}}{\text{Capacity per van}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of vans needed} = \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]

3. **Verify the calculation:**
   - Since 3 vans can hold \(3 \times 5 = 15\) people, which matches our total number of people, our calculation is correct.

### Conclusion:
Nancy's class will need 3 vans to transport all 15 people (12 students and 3 adults).

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of cans:**
   - Tom has 4 regular sodas.
   - He also has 52 diet sodas.
   - Total number of cans = 4 + 52 = 56 cans.

2. **Calculate the number of cans per shelf:**
   - The fridge can hold 7 cans per shelf.
   
3. **Divide the total number of cans by the number of cans per shelf to find out how many shelves are needed:**
   \[
   \text{Number of shelves} = \frac{\text{Total number of cans}}{\text{Cans per shelf}}
   \]
   Substituting the numbers we have:
   \[
   \text{Number of shelves} = \frac{56}{7} = 8
   \]

Therefore, Tom would need 8 shelves to fit all the cans in his fridge.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine how many apples were left after handing out 42 apples.
2. Calculate how many pies can be made using those remaining apples.

Let's go through these steps one at a time:

### Step 1: Determine how many apples were left after handing out 42 apples.
Initially, there are 96 apples in the cafeteria.

After giving away 42 apples, the number of apples left would be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Remaining apples} = 96 - 42 \]

Performing the subtraction:
\[ 96 - 42 = 54 \]
So, there are 54 apples left for making pies.

### Step 2: Calculate how many pies can be made using the remaining 54 apples.
Each pie requires 6 apples.

To find out how many pies can be made from 54 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number required per pie:
\[ \text{Number of pies} = \frac{54}{6} \]

Performing the division:
\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]
Therefore, they can make 9 pies.

1. **Determine the number of action figures needed:**
   - Henry currently has 3 action figures.
   - He wants a total of 8 action figures in his collection.

2. **Calculate the additional action figures required:**
   \[
   \text{Additional action figures} = \text{Total desired action figures} - \text{Current action figures}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Additional action figures} = 8 - 3 = 5
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost per action figure:**
   - Each action figure costs $6.

4. **Calculate the total cost for the additional action figures:**
   \[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much flour Tiffany needs in total and then subtract what she already has. Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Determine Total Flour Needed
Tiffany wants a total of 17 brownies.

Each brownie requires some amount of flour. Since she uses 8 cups of flour per brownie, let's calculate the total amount of flour needed:

\[
\text{Total Flour Needed} = \frac{\text{Total Brownies}}{\text{Flour Per Brownie}} = \frac{17}{8}
\]

Calculating this gives us:

\[
\text{Total Flour Needed} = 2.125 \text{ cups (per brownie)}
\]

Now, since she makes 17 brownies, multiply by 17 to get the total amount of flour required:

\[
\text{Total Flour Required} = 2.125 \times 17
\]

\[
\text{Total Flour Required} = 36.125 \text{ cups}
\]

### Step 2: Subtract What She Already Has
She has already used 8 cups of flour on each brownie. So, we need to calculate how much more flour she needs:

\[
\text{Remaining Flour Needed} = \text{Total Flour Required} - (\text{Flour Used per Brownie} \times \text{Number of Brownies})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Remaining Flour Needed} = 36.125 - (8 \times 17)
\]

\[
\text{Remaining Flour Needed} = 36.125 - 136
\]

\[
\text{Remaining Flour Needed} = -99.875
\]

This result indicates that Tiffany actually has more flour than needed. 

### Final Answer:
Since Tiffany has more flour than required, she **does not** need any additional flour. Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of carrots picked.
2. Calculate the number of good carrots based on the given percentage.
3. Subtract the number of good carrots from the total to find the number of bad carrots.

Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Total Number of Carrots Picked
Carol picked 29 carrots, and her mom picked 16 carrots. So, the total number of carrots picked is:
\[ 29 + 16 = 45 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Good Carrots
We know that only 38% of the carrots are good. Therefore, the number of good carrots can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of good carrots} = 0.38 \times 45 \]
\[ \text{Number of good carrots} = 17.1 \]

Since the number of carrots must be an integer, we round this to the nearest whole number. However, since 17.1 is already an integer, we proceed without rounding for now (but remember, in real-world scenarios, you might want to consider the context or adjust if necessary).

### Step 3: Calculate Bad Carrots
The rest of the carrots are bad. Since there are 45 carrots in total, the number of bad carrots is:
\[ \text{Number of bad carrots} = 45 - 17 = 28 \]

So, the final answer is:

Let's break down this problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of problems that need grading.
- There are 17 worksheets in total.
- Each worksheet has 7 problems.

To find the total number of problems, we multiply the number of worksheets by the number of problems per worksheet:

\[ \text{Total Problems} = 17 \times 7 = 119 \]

So far, we know there are 119 problems that need grading.

### Step 2: Determine how many problems have been graded so far.
- The teacher has already graded 8 problems.

### Step 3: Calculate how many more problems need to be graded.
- Subtract the number of problems already graded from the total number of problems.

\[ \text{Problems Remaining} = 119 - 8 = 111 \]

Therefore, the teacher still needs to grade 111 more problems.

3. **Determine the number of lives per friend:**
   - Each friend has 6 lives.

4. **Calculate the total number of lives:**
   - Since each of the 10 friends has 6 lives,
     Total lives = Number of friends × Lives per friend = 10 × 6 = 60.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of candies left after eating some:**
   - Bianca initially had 78 pieces of candy.
   - She ate 30 pieces.

   \[
   78 - 30 = 48 \text{ pieces remaining}
   \]

2. **Determine how many piles can be made with the remaining candies if each pile has 8 candies:**

   We divide the total number of remaining candies (48) by the number of candies per pile (8).

   \[
   \frac{48}{8} = 6
   \]

Therefore, Bianca can make 6 piles with 8 candies in each pile.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is that Bianca can make 6 piles.<|im_end|>",6,6.0,6.0

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify Initial Number of Players**:
   - There were initially 5 friends playing.

2. **Determine Additional Players Joining**:
   - It is stated that 2 more players joined the game.

3. **Calculate Total Number of Players After Addition**:
   - Initially: 5 players
   - Adding 2 more: \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) players in total.

4. **Calculate Total Lives if Each Player Has 8 Lives**:
   - Since there are 7 players now, we need to find out how many lives all these players together would have.
   - If each player has 8 lives, then for 7 players, the total number of lives would be \( 7 \times 8 \).

5. **Perform the Multiplication**:
   - \( 7 \times 8 = 56 \)

Therefore, the total number of lives that the group of players would have is **56**.

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Identify the total number of people**: There are 11 people in total.

2. **Determine the number of adults**: Since 2 out of the 11 people are children, we can find the number of adults by subtracting the number of children from the total number of people.
   - Number of adults = Total number of people - Number of children
   - Number of adults = 11 - 2 = 9

3. **Calculate the cost per adult meal**: Each adult meal costs $8.
   - Cost per adult meal = $8

4. **Calculate the total cost for all adults**:
   - Total cost for adults = Number of adults × Cost per adult meal
   - Total cost for adults = 9 × $8 = $72

5. **Calculate the total cost for the entire group**:
   - Total cost for the group = Cost per adult meal × Number of adults
   - Total cost for the group = $8 × 9 = $72

Therefore, the total cost for the group to eat at the restaurant is $72.

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of books**: Roger starts with 25 books.

2. **Books sold**: He sells 21 books.
   - Subtracting these from his initial amount: \( 25 - 21 = 4 \) books remaining after selling.

3. **Money earned**: The money earned from selling these books is enough for him to buy 30 new books.
   - This means he spent exactly the same amount of money as he received from selling the 21 books.
   - Therefore, he has no extra money left because the sale was exactly what he needed to buy 30 new books.

4. **Final count of books**: Since he didn't sell any more books (as mentioned in the problem), and he doesn't need to buy any new books (because they were already bought with the money he made from selling the first batch), his total remains unchanged at 25 books.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount Frank has after spending on mower blades:**
   - Frank earned $19 from mowing lawns.
   - He spent $11 on new mower blades.

   Let's subtract his expenses from his earnings to find out how much money he has left.

\[
\text{Money left} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Expenses}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Money left} = 19 - 11 = 8
\]

So, Frank has $8 left.

2. **Determine how many $2 game sets he can buy with the remaining money:**

   We need to divide the money left by the price of one game set to see how many complete sets he can purchase.

\[
\text{Number of game sets} = \frac{\text{Money left}}{\text{Price per game}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of game sets} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
\]

Therefore, Frank can buy 4 game sets with the money left over.

Nancy deleted 31 files.

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining number of files
Nancy originally had 80 files. After deleting 31 files, she has:
\[ 80 - 31 = 49 \text{ files left} \]

### Step 3: Determine how many folders were used to store the remaining files
Each folder contains 7 files. To find out how many folders are needed for the remaining 49 files, we divide the number of remaining files by the number of files per folder:

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of students who got selected.
We start with 65 students trying out for the trivia teams.

From the information given, 17 students did not get selected.

So, the number of students who got selected can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of selected students} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Students not selected} \]
\[ \text{Number of selected students} = 65 - 17 = 48 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of students per group after dividing them equally among 8 groups.
Given that there are 48 students and they need to be divided into 8 equal groups.

First, calculate the total number of students per group:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{\text{Number of selected students}}{\text{Number of groups}} \]
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \]

Therefore, each group will have **6** students.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pictures taken:**
   - Pictures taken at the zoo: 41
   - Pictures taken at the museum: 29
   - Total pictures taken = 41 + 29

2. **Subtract the number of pictures deleted:**
   - Pictures deleted: 15
   - Remaining pictures after deletion = Total pictures taken - Deleted pictures

Let's perform the calculations:

1. Calculate the total number of pictures taken:
\[ \text{Total pictures} = 41 + 29 = 70 \]

2. Subtract the number of pictures deleted:
\[ \text{Remaining pictures} = 70 - 15 = 55 \]

So, Gwen still has 55 pictures from her vacation.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of puppies**: The pet shelter initially has 2 puppies.
2. **Additional puppies added**: Another 34 puppies are brought into the shelter.
3. **Total number of puppies**: We need to find out the total number of puppies after adding the additional ones.

   \[
   \text{Total Puppies} = \text{Initial Puppies} + \text{Additional Puppies}
   \]

   Substituting the given numbers:

   \[
   \text{Total Puppies} = 2 + 34 = 36
   \]

4. **Puppies adopted per day**: Each day, 4 puppies are adopted.

5. **Time taken to adopt all puppies**: To determine how many days it will take to adopt all 36 puppies at a rate of 4 puppies per day, we divide the total number of puppies by the daily adoption rate.

   \[
   \text{Days Required} = \frac{\text{Total Puppies}}{\text{Daily Adoption Rate}}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Days Required} = \frac{36}{4} = 9

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Total number of clothes**: Will has 59 pieces of clothing.
   
2. **Number of clothes in one load**: Will puts 32 of those in one load.

   To find out how many clothes will be left after putting 32 in one load, we subtract from the total:
   \[
   59 - 32 = 27
   \]

3. **Number of remaining clothes**: After placing 32 clothes in one load, there are 27 pieces left.

4. **Number of small loads**: Will decides to split these remaining clothes into 9 equal smaller loads.

   To determine how many pieces of clothing can fit into each small load, we divide the remaining clothes by the number of loads:
   \[
   \frac{27}{9} = 3

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of boxes:**
   - Adam bought 2 boxes of chocolate candy.
   - Adam also bought some number of boxes of caramel candy.

2. **Identify the unknown quantity:**
   - Let's denote the number of boxes of caramel candy as \( x \).

3. **Calculate the total number of boxes:**
   - The total number of boxes is given as \( 2 + x \).

4. **Calculate the total number of pieces in the chocolate candy boxes:**
   - Each box of chocolate candy contains 4 pieces.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces in the chocolate candy boxes is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).

5. **Calculate the total number of pieces in the caramel candy boxes:**
   - Each box of caramel candy also contains 4 pieces.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces in the caramel candy boxes is \( x \times 4 \).

6. **Set up an equation to represent the total amount of candy:**
   - The total amount of candy (in terms of pieces) should be equal to the sum of the pieces from both types of candy.
   - This gives us the equation: \( 8 + x \times 4 = T \), where \( T \) represents the total number of pieces of candy.

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - We know that Adam buys these candies in packs of 5, so \( x \) must be such that when multiplied by 4, it results in a value that can be divided by 5 to give a whole number of packs.
   - Simplifying the equation, we get: \( 8 + 4x = T \).
   - Since \( T \) must be divisible by 5, let’s check possible values for \( x \):
     - For \( x = 3 \): \( 8 + 4 \times 3 = 20 \). Dividing 20 by 5 gives 4 packs, which is valid.
     - For other values of \( x \), the result will not be divisible by 5.

Therefore, \( x = 3 \) is the correct number of boxes of caramel candy.

8. **Calculate the total amount of candy:**
   - With \( x = 3 \), the total number of pieces of candy is \( 8 + 4 \times 3 = 20 \).

So, Adam had a total of 20 pieces of candy.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of books Victor bought.
Victor bought 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books. So, we add these together to find the total number of books.

\[ \text{Total books} = 32 + 37 \]

\[ \text{Total books} = 69 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of new books after accounting for the ones that were used.
We know that 16 of the books were used. To find out how many books Victor actually bought, we need to subtract the number of used books from the total number of books.

\[ \text{New books} = \text{Total books} - \text{Used books} \]

\[ \text{New books} = 69 - 16 \]

\[ \text{New books} = 53 \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 53 new books did Victor buy.<|im_end|>",53,53.0,53.0

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pick**: Maria initially picks 48 carrots.

2. **Throw Out**: She throws out 11% of these carrots.
   - Calculate 11% of 48: \(0.11 \times 48 = 5.24\)
   - Since she can't throw out a fraction of a carrot, we'll round to the nearest whole number. In this case, it's already an integer, so no rounding needed for our calculation here.

3. **Remaining After Throwing Out**:
   - Subtract the thrown-out carrots from the initial pick: \(48 - 5.24 = 42.76\) (or simply 42 if you're working in whole numbers)

4. **Pick More Carrots Next Day**:
   - The next day, she picks 15 more carrots.

5. **Total Number of Carrots After Picking**:
   - Add the remaining carrots after throwing out to the newly picked carrots: \(42 + 15 = 57\)

### Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks the money will last.
To find out how many weeks the money will last, we divide the total amount of money by the weekly spending limit:
\[ \text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{\$45}{\$5/\text{week}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Weeks} = 9 \]

Therefore, the money will last Jerry for **9** weeks.

                    question:
                    ,  ; Adam had . 33 books. , If ? he sold 11 of them and used , the money . he ? earned ! to buy 23 new ; books, , how many : books would ? Adam have? . 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of books Adam has.
Adam initially has 33 books.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Adam earned from selling his books.
If Adam sells 11 books and uses that money to buy 23 new books, we need to find out how much money he made from these sales. Let's denote the price of one book as \( p \).

- Total money earned = Number of books sold × Price per book
\[ \text{Total money} = 11p \]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining books after selling some.
After selling 11 books, Adam will be left with:
\[ \text{Remaining books} = 33 - 11 = 22 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of buying 23 new books.
Let's denote the price of one book as \( p \). The total cost for 23 books would be:
\[ \text{Cost of 23 books} = 23p \]

### Step 5: Find the value of \( p \) using the information given.
Since Adam spent all his earnings on the new books, we know that the money he earned equals the cost of the new books. So,
\[ 11p = 23p \]
This equation doesn't make sense because \( p \) cannot be zero (since then he wouldn't earn any money). Instead, we should use the fact that he spent exactly the same amount of money on both purchases. Therefore, we can set up an equation where the money he earned equals the cost of 11 books at their market price:
\[ 11p = 11 \times \text{market price of one book} \]
So, the market price of one book must equal \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{\text{market price}}{11} \]

### Step 6: Substitute back to find the total money Adam earned.
Now, if Adam bought 23 books at the market price, he paid:
\[ \text{Money spent on 23 books} = 23 \times \frac{\text{market price}}{11} \]

Since this is equal to the money he earned from selling 11 books:
\[ 11p = 23 \times \frac{p}{11} \]
Solving for \( p \), we get:
\[ 11^2 \cdot p = 23p \]
\[ 121p = 23p \]
\[ p = \frac{23}{121} \]

### Step 7: Calculate the total number of books Adam has after purchasing the new ones.
Now that we know \( p \), we can calculate the total number of books Adam has after buying 23 new books:
\[ \text{Total books} = 33 + 23 \]
\[ \text{Total books} = 56 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{56}

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided and calculate the total number of cans Kaleb collected.

1. **Identify the number of bags filled on Saturday:**
   - According to the problem, Kaleb filled 5 bags on Saturday.

2. **Calculate the number of cans per bag:**
   - Each bag contains 4 cans.

3. **Determine the total number of cans from Saturday’s collection:**
   - Number of cans = Number of bags * Cans per bag
   - Total cans from Saturday = 5 bags * 4 cans/bag = 20 cans

4. **Identify the number of bags filled on Sunday:**
   - The problem states that on Sunday, Kaleb filled 5 more bags than on Saturday.

5. **Calculate the number of bags filled on Sunday:**
   - Bags filled on Sunday = Bags filled on Saturday + Additional bags on Sunday
   - Bags filled on Sunday = 5 bags (Saturday) + 5 bags (additional) = 10 bags

6. **Calculate the total number of cans from Sunday’s collection:**
   - Number of cans = Number of bags * Cans per bag
   - Total cans from Sunday = 10 bags * 4 cans/bag = 40 cans

7. **Add the total cans from both days together:**
   - Total cans = Cans from Saturday + Cans from Sunday
   - Total cans = 20 cans (Saturday) + 40 cans (Sunday) = 60 cans

Therefore, the total number of cans Kaleb picked up is \(\boxed{60}\).<|im_end|>",40,40.0,60.0

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and reason through each one.

1. **Determine the number of mystery books:**
   - Nancy has 2 shelves of mystery books.
   - Each shelf contains exactly 6 books.
   - Therefore, the total number of mystery books is \(2 \times 6 = 12\).

2. **Determine the number of picture books:**
   - Nancy has 6 shelves of picture books.
   - Each shelf contains exactly 6 books.
   - Therefore, the total number of picture books is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

3. **Calculate the total number of books:**
   - Add the number of mystery books and picture books together.
   - Total number of books = Mystery books + Picture books = \(12 + 36 = 48\).

Therefore, Nancy has a total of 48 books.

2. Calculate how many $5 toys he can buy with that amount.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Paul has.
Paul initially saved $3 and then received an additional $7 for his allowance. So, the total amount of money he has is:
\[ \text{Total Money} = \$3 + \$7 = \$10 \]

Step 2: Determine how many $5 toys he can buy with the total amount of money.
Since each toy costs $5, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one toy:
\[ \text{Number of Toys} = \frac{\$10}{\$5} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of $5 toys Paul can buy is 2.

**Step 1: Determine the number of members who actually showed up**

- Total number of members in the trivia team = 14
- Number of members who didn't show up = 7

Number of members who showed up = Total members - Members who didn't show up

   - Each showing-up member scores 6 points.
   - Number of showing-up members: 3
   - Points per showing-up member: 6
   - Total points scored = (Number of showing-up members) × (Points per showing-up member)

To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of books left for Oliver.
Oliver starts with 46 books in total.

- The librarian takes out \( \frac{1}{4} \) of these books.
- This means the librarian takes out \( \frac{46}{4} = 11.5 \). Since we cannot take half a book, we round up to 12 books (because if fewer than 12 were taken, there would be more than 34 books left).

So, the librarian takes out 12 books, leaving \( 46 - 12 = 34 \) books for Oliver.

### Step 2: Calculate how many shelves Oliver needs.
Oliver can fit 4 books on one shelf.

- To find out how many shelves he needs, divide the remaining books by the number of books per shelf: \( \frac{34}{4} = 8.5 \).
- Since Oliver cannot use a fraction of a shelf, we round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, Oliver needs **9** shelves to accommodate all the books.

   - Luke has 5 piles of quarters.
   - Luke has 5 piles of dimes.

3. **Calculate the number of coins per pile:**
   - Each pile contains 3 coins.

4. **Calculate the total number of coins for each type of coin:**
   - For quarters: \(5 \text{ piles} \times 3 \text{ coins/pile} = 15 \text{ quarters}\).
     - Total value from quarters: \(15 \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 375 \text{ cents}\).

   - For dimes: \(5 \text{ piles} \times 3 \text{ coins/pile} = 15 \text{ dimes}\).
     - Total value from dimes: \(15 \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 150 \text{ cents}\).

5. **Add the values together to find the total number of coins:**
   - Total number of coins: \(15 \text{ quarters} + 15 \text{ dimes} = 30 \text{ coins}\).

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of points Gwen earns from recycling.
2. Determine the number of points her friends earn from recycling.
3. Sum the points earned by both to find the total.

Step 1: Calculate the points Gwen earns.
- Gwen recycles 5 pounds.
- She earns 1 point for every 3 pounds recycled.
- Number of points = (Pounds recycled / Points per pound) * Points per pound
= (5 / 3) * 1
= 5/3

Step 2: Calculate the points her friends earn.
- Her friends recycle 13 pounds.
- They also earn 1 point for every 3 pounds recycled.
- Number of points = (Pounds recycled / Points per pound) * Points per pound

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of birds in the pet store based on the given information about the number of parrots and parakeets per cage.

1. **Identify the components:**
   - Each cage contains 8 parrots.
   - Each cage also contains 2 parakeets.

2. **Calculate the total number of birds per cage:**
   Since there are 8 parrots and 2 parakeets in each cage, the total number of birds per cage is:
   \[
   8 + 2 = 10
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of cages:**
   The problem states that there are 4 cages in the pet store.

4. **Calculate the total number of birds for all cages combined:**
   To find the total number of birds across all cages, multiply the total number of birds per cage (10) by the number of cages (4):
   \[
   10 \times 4 = 40
   \]

Therefore, the total number of birds in the pet store is \(40\).

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of chocolate candies in all 14 boxes.
Each box contains 6 pieces of chocolate candy.

Total number of candies = Number of boxes × Number of candies per box

\[
\text{Total candies} = 14 \times 6
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of candies given away to Kaleb's little brother.
Kaleb gives away 5 boxes worth of candies.

Candies given away = Number of boxes given away × Number of candies per box

\[
\text{Candies given away} = 5 \times 6
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the number of candies given away from the total number of candies.
This will give us the remaining number of candies Kaleb has.

Remaining candies = Total candies - Candies given away

Now let's do these calculations:

### Calculation for Step 1:
\[
14 \times 6 = 84
\]

So, there are **84** pieces of chocolate candy in total.

### Calculation for Step 2:
\[
5 \times 6 = 30
\]

So, Kaleb gives away **30** pieces of chocolate candy.

### Calculation for Step 3:
\[
84 - 30 = 54
\]

Therefore, Kaleb still has **54** pieces of chocolate candy.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:

   - Robin uploaded 31 pictures from her phone.
   - She also uploaded 5 pictures from her camera.
   - Total number of pictures = 31 (from phone) + 5 (from camera) = 36 pictures.

2. **Number of albums**:
   - Robin sorted these pictures into 9 different albums.

3. **Equal distribution**:
   - Since there are 9 albums and the same number of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

4. **Calculation**:
   - Divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums: \( \frac{36}{9} = 4 \).

Therefore, the number of pictures in each of the albums is **4**.

To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. **Number of shelves**: We need to determine the number of shelves for both mystery books and picture books.
2. **Books per shelf**: Each shelf must contain exactly 8 books.

Let's calculate the total number of books:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of mystery books**:
   - Number of shelves: 5
   - Books per shelf: 8
   - Total number of books = Number of shelves × Books per shelf
   \[
   \text{Total number of mystery books} = 5 \times 8 = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of picture books**:
   - Number of shelves: 4
   - Books per shelf: 8
   - Total number of books = Number of shelves × Books per shelf
   \[
   \text{Total number of picture books} = 4 \times 8 = 32
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of books**:
   - Total number of mystery books + Total number of picture books
   \[
   \text{Total number of books} = 40 (mystery) + 32 (picture) = 72
   \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of cards John has**

John has two types of cards:
- New cards (let's call this \(N\))
- Old cards (let's call this \(O\))

We know from the problem statement that John has 8 new cards and 16 old cards.

So, we can write:
\[ N = 8 \]
\[ O = 16 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of cards**

The total number of cards is the sum of the new and old cards:
\[ Total = N + O \]
Substituting the values we found:
\[ Total = 8 + 16 \]
\[ Total = 24 \]

**Step 3: Determine how many pages are needed given the card per page ratio**

According to the problem, John organizes his cards such that there are 3 cards on each page.
\[ Cards per page = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many pages are needed for 24 cards, we divide the total number of cards by the number of cards per page:
\[ Pages = \frac{Total}{Cards per page} \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ Pages = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ Pages = 8 \]

Therefore, John would need **8 pages** to organize all his cards in the binder.<|im_end|>",8,8.0,8.0

   - Isabel needs a total of 5 brownies.
   - Each brownie requires 5 cups of flour.

2. **Calculate the total amount of flour required:**
   \[
   \text{Total flour needed} = 5 \text{ brownies} \times 5 \text{ cups per brownie}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total flour needed} = 25 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Determine how much flour Isabel has already used:**
   - She has already used 5 cups of flour.

4. **Calculate how much more flour she needs to buy or use:**
   - Subtract the amount of flour she has from the total amount needed.
   \[
   \text{Flour left to be used} = \text{Total flour needed} - \text{Flour already used}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Flour left to be used} = 25 \text{ cups} - 5 \text{ cups}

                    .  Tom bought 40 tickets ; at ? the state fair. ? He spent ; 28 ! tickets , at the 'dunk a clown' , booth and decided ! to . use , the rest on . rides. ! If each . ride , cost 4 : tickets, . how many ; rides could he . go . on? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of tickets Tom has:**
   - Tom bought 40 tickets.

2. **Calculate the number of tickets used in the ""dunk a clown"" booth:**
   - Tom spent 28 tickets in the ""dunk a clown"" booth.

3. **Subtract the tickets used from the total number of tickets:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining tickets} = \text{Total tickets} - \text{Tickets spent}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining tickets} = 40 - 28 = 12
   \]

4. **Determine the cost per ticket for rides:**
   - Each ride costs 4 tickets.

5. **Calculate the maximum number of rides Tom can go on:**
   \[
   \text{Number of rides} = \frac{\text{Remaining tickets}}{\text{Cost per ride}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of rides} = \frac{12}{4} = 3

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Initial Count
At the start of the year, there were 31 students.

### Step 2: Changes Over Time
- 5 students left during the year.
- 11 new students joined during the year.

### Step 3: Calculate the Final Number
We need to calculate the total number of students at the end of the year after accounting for these changes.

#### Calculation:
Initial count: 31 students

Change due to leaving: -5 students (since they left)
Change due to joining: +11 students (since they joined)

Final count = Initial count + Change due to leaving + Change due to joining
Final count = 31 + (-5) + 11
Final count = 31 - 5 + 11
Final count = 26 + 11
Final count = 37

Therefore, at the end of the year, there were **37** students in fourth grade.<|im_end|>",37,37.0,37.0

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many points Bianca earns.
2. Determine how many points her friends earn.
3. Sum the points from both Bianca and her friends.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate Points for Bianca
- **Given:** Bianca recycled 24 pounds.
- **Points per 3 pounds recycled:** 1 point.
  
To find out how many sets of 3 pounds she has recycled:
\[ \text{Number of sets} = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \]

Since each set of 3 pounds gives her 1 point:
\[ \text{Total points for Bianca} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \]

#### Step 2: Calculate Points for Her Friends
- **Given:** Her friends recycled 3 pounds each.
- **Total pounds recycled by friends:** \( 3 \times n \) where \( n \) is the number of friends.
- **Points per 3 pounds recycled by friends:** 1 point.

We know that her friends recycled in total 24 pounds (since they have 8 sets of 3 pounds):
\[ 3 \times n = 24 \]
Solving for \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \]

Each friend gets 1 point per set of 3 pounds:
\[ \text{Points per friend} = 1 \]
So, if there are 8 friends:
\[ \text{Total points for friends} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \]

#### Step 3: Sum the Points
Now, add the points from Bianca and her friends:
\[ \text{Total points} = \text{Bianca's points} + \text{Friends' points} \]
\[ \text{Total points} = 8 + 8 = 16 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: {The final answer is} 16 points.<|im_end|>",9,9.0,16.0

<|im_start|>system
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. **Determine total number of people in the group:**
   - We know there are three groups of friends.
   - Each group has one friend.
   - Therefore, the total number of people in the group is \(3 \times 1 = 3\).

2. **Calculate the total number of chicken wings cooked:**
   - The chef initially prepared 8 chicken wings.
   - He then cooked an additional 10 wings for the group.
   - So, the total number of wings is \(8 + 10 = 18\).

3. **Divide the total number of wings equally among the group members:**
   - There are 3 people in the group.
   - To find out how many wings each person gets, we divide the total number of wings by the number of people.
   - So, each person gets \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) wings.

Therefore, each person would get 6 chicken wings.

2. **Action**: He throws away 19 old socks that don't fit him.
3. **Calculation**: Subtract the number of thrown-away socks from the initial number to find out how many socks he has left after throwing some away.

   \[
   33 - 19 = 14
   \]

   So, John now has 14 socks remaining.

4. **New Purchase**: He then buys 13 more socks.
5. **Final Calculation**: Add the newly purchased socks to the current total to find out the final count.

   \[
   14 + 13 = 27

   - The team has 2 new players.
   - The team has 6 returning players.
   
   Adding these together gives us the total number of players:
   \[
   2 + 6 = 8 \text{ players}
   \]

2. **Divide the total number of players by the number of players per group:**
   - Each group consists of 4 players.

   We divide the total number of players (8) by the number of players per group (4):
   \[
   8 \div 4 = 2
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The result of dividing 8 by 4 gives us 2 groups.

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to track the changes in the number of students over time. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Initial Count
At the beginning of the first quarter (Q1), there were 10 students.

\[ \text{Initial count} = 10 \]

### Step 2: Changes Over Time
- **End of Q1**: Students leave or arrive.
- **End of Q2**: Another set of changes occur.

#### End of Q1:
We know that during the year 4, some students left and 42 new students joined. This means the net change for the entire year was -42 students (since more students left than joined).

Since the initial count at the start of the year was 10, we can calculate how many students remained after leaving:

\[ \text{Remaining after Q1} = 10 - 42 \]

However, since the remaining count cannot be negative, it implies that all but one student must have left by the end of Q1.

\[ \text{Students left} = 42 \]
\[ \text{Remaining} = 10 - 42 + 1 \] 

This calculation shows an inconsistency because if 39 students remain, then only 1 must have left, which doesn't match our earlier assumption about all but one student having left.

Given the logical flow, let's assume that no students left but instead 42 new students joined the school at the end of Q1.

\[ \text{New students joined} = 42 \]
\[ \text{Final count} = 10 + 42 \]

\[ \text{Books left} = 14 - 2 = 12 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of shelves needed.
- Each shelf holds 3 books.
- Number of shelves required = Total number of books left ÷ Books per shelf

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of flowers Bianca picked:**
   - Tulips: 39
   - Roses: 49

   Total flowers = Tulips + Roses
   \[
   \text{Total flowers} = 39 + 49 = 88
   \]

2. **Determine how many flowers were used in the bouquets:**
   - Flowers used: 81

3. **Calculate the number of extra flowers Bianca picked beyond what was needed for the bouquets:**
   - Extra flowers = Total flowers - Flowers used
   \[
   \text{Extra flowers} = 88 - 81 = 7

                    question:
                     Emily bought 4 : new ? chairs and 2 new ! tables , for ? her house. ? If she spent 8 minutes ; on ? each piece ; furniture : putting it , together, how : many ? minutes . did it . take : her : to finish? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of pieces of furniture:**
   - Emily bought 4 chairs.
   - She also bought 2 tables.

   Total pieces of furniture = Chairs + Tables
   \[
   4 \text{ chairs} + 2 \text{ tables} = 6 \text{ pieces of furniture}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to put one piece of furniture together:**
   - It took 8 minutes to put all the furniture together.

3. **Find out how long it takes to put one piece of furniture together:**
   - Since it took 8 minutes to put everything together, we divide the total time by the total number of pieces of furniture.
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ minutes}}{6 \text{ pieces of furniture}} = \frac{8}{6} \text{ minutes per piece}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ minutes per piece}
   \]

Therefore, it took Emily \(\frac{4}{3}\) minutes (or approximately 1.33 minutes) to put one piece of furniture together.

Since there are 6 pieces of furniture, multiply this time by 6 to find the total time:
\[
6 \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ minutes} = 8 \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ minutes} = \frac{24}{3} \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the final answer is:

2. **Determine the number of parrots per cage**: Each cage contains 2 parrots.
   
   Step 2: Number of parrots per cage = 2.
   
3. **Calculate the total number of parrots**:
   - Multiply the number of cages by the number of parrots per cage.
   
   \[
   \text{Total number of parrots} = 6 \times 2 = 12
   \]

4. **Determine the number of parakeets per cage**: Each cage contains 7 parakeets.
   
   Step 3: Number of parakeets per cage = 7.
   
5. **Calculate the total number of parakeets**:
   - Multiply the number of cages by the number of parakeets per cage.
   
   \[
   \text{Total number of parakeets} = 6 \times 7 = 42
   \]

6. **Add the total number of parrots and parakeets together to get the total number of birds**:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Total number of students**:
   - Boys: 26
   - Girls: 46
   - Total = 26 + 46 = 72 students

2. **Number of students per group**:
   - We need to divide these 72 students into groups.
   - Each group should have an equal number of students.

3. **Determine possible group sizes**:
   - The total number of students (72) must be divisible by the number of students in each group.
   - Let's list out the factors of 72 that would allow us to form groups of at least one student each.

   Factors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72

4. **Possible group sizes**:
   - Since we want as many groups as possible, we should choose the largest factor that allows for more than just one group.
   - The largest factor is 36.

5. **Calculate the number of groups**:
   - If each group has 36 students,
     \[
     \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of students per group}} = \frac{72}{36} = 2

2. Calculate the number of apples used based on the number of students who want fruit.
3. Subtract the number of apples used from the total to find out how many were left over.

Step 1: Total number of apples ordered
- The cafeteria ordered 6 red apples + 15 green apples = 21 apples in total.

Step 2: Number of apples used
- According to the problem, 5 students wanted fruit.

Step 3: Calculate remaining apples
- Since all 5 students took their share, we subtract the number of students who ate from the total number of apples ordered.
- Remaining apples = 21 (total apples) - 5 (students who ate)

Let's do the calculation:

Remaining apples = 21 - 5 = 16

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 16 extra apples.

   - Vanessa also bought 3 daisies.

3. **Calculate the cost for the roses:**
   - Since each rose costs $8, the total cost for 3 roses is \( 3 \times 8 = \$24 \).

4. **Calculate the cost for the daisies:**
   - Similarly, since each daisy costs $8, the total cost for 3 daisies is \( 3 \times 8 = \$24 \).

5. **Add the costs together to find the total amount spent:**
   - The total cost for roses is $24.
   - The total cost for daisies is $24.
   - Therefore, the total amount spent is \( 24 + 24 = \$48 \).

6. **Consider the discount:**
   - The problem states that there was no discount applied, so we do not need to subtract any value due to the discount.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The total amount Vanessa spent on her purchase is $48.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{48}$<|im_end|>",48,48.0,48.0

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total number of pictures:**
   - Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone.
   - She also uploaded 35 pictures from her camera.

2. **Calculate the total number of pictures:**
   \[
   \text{Total pictures} = 5 + 35 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine the number of albums:**
   - Olivia sorted these pictures into 8 different albums.

4. **Calculate the number of pictures per album:**
   To find out how many pictures were in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.
   \[
   \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{\text{Total pictures}}{\text{Number of albums}} = \frac{40}{8}
   \]
   Simplifying this division:
   \[
   \frac{40}{8} = 5
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is that there were **5** pictures in each album.<|im_end|>",5,5.0,5.0

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many baggies Robin can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of cookies**: We know that Robin has two types of cookies: chocolate chip cookies (6) and oatmeal cookies (25). So, the total number of cookies is \(6 + 25 = 31\).

2. **Calculate how many bags can be made with the total cookies**: Each baggie contains 6 cookies. To find out how many baggies can be made from 31 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per baggie.
   \[
   \text{Number of baggies} = \frac{\text{Total number of cookies}}{\text{Cookies per baggie}} = \frac{31}{6}
   \]

3. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   \frac{31}{6} = 5 \text{ remainder } 1
   \]
   This means that Robin can fill 5 full baggies completely because she has enough cookies for those 5 baggies but not enough for an additional one.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 5 baggies.<|im_end|>",8,8.0,5.0

Cody started with 45 dollars.

Step 2: Calculate how many dollars Cody received as a gift for his birthday.
He received 9 more dollars from someone else.

Step 3: Add the amount he received to his initial amount.
45 + 9 = 54 dollars

Step 4: Subtract the amount he spent from the total he has after receiving the gift.
He spent $19 on a new game.

Step 5: Subtract the amount he spent from the total he has after receiving the gift.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of pictures:**
   - Wendy uploaded 22 pictures from her phone.
   - She also uploaded 2 pictures from her camera.
   - Total number of pictures = 22 (phone) + 2 (camera) = 24 pictures.

2. **Determine the number of pictures per album:**
   - The total number of pictures is 24.
   - These pictures need to be divided equally among 4 different albums.
   - Number of pictures per album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums
     \[
     \text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{24}{4}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of pictures per album} = 6
     \]

3. **Verify that all pictures can fit into these albums:**
   - Each album contains 6 pictures.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Total number of puppies**: The pet store initially has 88 puppies.

2. **Puppies sold in one day**: They sold 34 puppies that day.

3. **Remaining puppies after selling**: To find out how many puppies were left, we subtract the number sold from the total number:
   \[
   88 - 34 = 54

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of files**: Wendy starts with 82 files.

2. **Files deleted**: Wendy deletes 37% of these files.
   - To find out how many files she deletes, we calculate: \( 0.37 \times 82 = 30.14 \). Since we can't have a fraction of a file, we round to the nearest whole number, which gives us 30 files deleted.

3. **Remaining files after deletion**: Subtract the deleted files from the initial total.
   - Remaining files = \( 82 - 30 = 52 \).

4. **Number of files per folder**: Each folder contains 5 files.

5. **Total number of folders needed**: Divide the remaining files by the number of files per folder.
   - Number of folders = \( \frac{52}{5} = 10.4 \). Since we can't have a fraction of a folder, we need to round up to the nearest whole number because even if there are some leftover files, they still need their own folder.

6. **Final count of folders**: Round up 10.4 to the nearest whole number, giving us 11 folders.

Therefore, Wendy ends up with 11 folders.<|im_end|>",9,9.0,11.0

   Total number of players = New players + Returning players
   \[
   \text{Total players} = 12 + 44 = 56

2. **Divide the total number of players by the number of players per group:**
   - Each group will have 8 players.

   So, after buying the mower blades, Will has $63 left.

3. **Determine how many $9 game sets he can buy with the remaining money:**
   - Each game set costs $9.
   - To find out how many sets he can buy, divide the remaining money by the cost per set:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Saturday:**
   - Sam filled 3 bags.
   - Each bag has 9 cans.

2. **Sunday:**
   - Sam filled 4 more bags.
   - Again, each bag has 9 cans.

Now let's calculate the total number of cans:

1. Calculate the total number of cans from Saturday:
   - Number of bags = 3
   - Cans per bag = 9
   - Total cans on Saturday = 3 * 9 = 27 cans

2. Calculate the total number of cans from Sunday:
   - Number of bags = 4
   - Cans per bag = 9
   - Total cans on Sunday = 4 * 9 = 36 cans

3. Add the totals together to find the overall number of cans picked up:
   - Total cans = Cans from Saturday + Cans from Sunday
   - Total cans = 27 + 36 = 63 cans

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 63 cans.<|im_end|>",63,63.0,63.0

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many problems remain for the teacher to grade.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine the total number of problems in all worksheets**:
   - Each worksheet has 4 problems.
   - The teacher has 16 worksheets to grade.
   
   Therefore, the total number of problems is calculated as follows:
   \[
   4 \text{ (problems per worksheet)} \times 16 \text{ (worksheets)} = 64 \text{ (total problems)}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of problems already graded**:
   - The teacher has already graded 8 problems.

3. **Subtract the number of problems already graded from the total number of problems**:
   - To find out how many more problems the teacher needs to grade, subtract the number of graded problems from the total number of problems:
   \[
   64 \text{ (total problems)} - 8 \text{ (graded problems)} = 56 \text{ (remaining problems)}
   \]

Therefore, the teacher still has to grade **56 problems**.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of items in each box:**
   - Each box contains 5 scarves.
   - Each box contains 5 mittens.

2. **Calculate the total number of scarfs in all boxes combined:**
   - Since there are 6 boxes and each box contains 5 scarves,
     \[
     6 \text{ boxes} \times 5 \text{ scarves per box} = 30 \text{ scarfs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of mittenes in all boxes combined:**
   - Similarly, since there are 6 boxes and each box contains 5 mittens,
     \[
     6 \text{ boxes} \times 5 \text{ mittens per box} = 30 \text{ mittens}
     \]

4. **Add the total number of scarfs and mittens to find the total number of winter clothing pieces:**
   - Total pieces of winter clothing = Scarfs + Mittens
   \[
   30 \text{ scarfs} + 30 \text{ mittens} = 60 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Therefore, Paige has a total of 60 pieces of winter clothing. The final answer is {The final answer is}: 60 pieces of winter clothing.<|im_end|>",60,60.0,60.0

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of potatoes needed.
The chef needs to cook 12 potatoes.

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken for each potato.
Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

### Step 3: Calculate the total time taken to cook all the potatoes.
Since there are 12 potatoes and each takes 6 minutes:
\[ \text{Total time} = 12 \times 6 = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 4: Determine if the chef has already cooked any potatoes.
The chef has already cooked 6 potatoes.

### Step 5: Calculate the number of remaining potatoes that need cooking.
There were originally 12 potatoes in total. After the chef has cooked 6 potatoes:
\[ \text{Remaining potatoes} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

### Step 6: Calculate the time required to cook the remaining potatoes.
Since each potato still takes 6 minutes to cook, for the remaining 6 potatoes:
\[ \text{Time for remaining potatoes} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

<|im_start|>system
Sure! Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many games were left after selling some.
Luke started with 57 games. He sold 39 of those games. So, we need to subtract 39 from 57:

\[ 57 - 39 = 18 \]

So, Luke has 18 games left that he hasn't sold yet.

### Step 2: Calculate how many games fit into one box.
Luke packs these remaining 18 games into boxes, where he puts 2 games in each box.

To find out how many boxes he needs for 18 games, divide the total number of games by the number of games per box:

\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

So, Luke will have 9 boxes ready.

### Final Answer:
Luke had **9** boxes to use.<|im_end|>",9,9.0,9.0

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the cost per item:**
   - Each flower (in this case, a rose) costs $3.

2. **Calculate the total cost for the roses:**
   - Emily bought 2 roses.
   - Cost of one rose = $3.
   - Total cost for 2 roses = 2 × $3 = $6.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the daisies:**
   - The problem does not specify the number of daisies or their individual price. However, since no further information is provided about the price of the daisies, let's assume that they do not contribute to the total amount spent on the sale.

4. **Sum up all the expenses:**
   - Total cost for roses = $6.
   - Since the problem states there were only ""flowers"" involved in the sale and no other items mentioned, we can conclude that the total amount spent is solely on the roses.

5. **Final calculation:**
   - Total amount spent by Emily = $6.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total Flowers**: Isabel picked 66 flowers.
2. **Flowers per Bouquet**: Each bouquet contains 8 flowers.

First, let's calculate how many full bouquets Isabel can initially make:
   - Total flowers ÷ Flowers per bouquet = Number of full bouquets
   - 66 ÷ 8 = 8 bouquets (since we can't have a fraction of a bouquet)

So, Isabel can initially make 8 bouquets.

3. **Wilted Flowers**: We know that 10 flowers wilted before the wedding.

4. **Remaining Flowers**: Subtract the wilted flowers from the total number of flowers to find out how many flowers are left:
   - Total flowers - Wilted flowers = Remaining flowers
   - 66 - 10 = 56 flowers remaining

5. **Bouquets Made After Removal**: Now, we need to determine how many more bouquets Isabel can make with the remaining flowers:
   - Remaining flowers ÷ Flowers per bouquet = Number of additional bouquets
   - 56 ÷ 8 = 7 bouquets

Therefore, Isabel can still make 7 more bouquets after removing the wilted flowers.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of tickets Oliver used for his rides at the carnival. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of rides:**
   - Oliver rode the Ferris wheel 5 times.
   - Oliver rode the Bumper cars 4 times.

   Total rides = Ferris wheel rides + Bumper car rides
                  = 5 + 4
                  = 9 rides

2. **Determine the cost per ride:**
   - Each ride costs 7 tickets.

3. **Calculate the total number of tickets needed:**
   - To find out the total number of tickets Oliver used, multiply the total number of rides by the cost per ride.

Total tickets = (Total rides) × (Cost per ride)
                = 9 × 7

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Collection**: Ned started with an unknown number of games.

2. **Games Purchased**:
   - From a friend: 27 games
   - At a garage sale: Let's denote the number of games purchased from the garage sale as \( x \).

3. **Total Games Purchased**:
   - Total games = 27 (from friend) + \( x \) (from garage sale)

4. **Games Not Working**:
   - Out of these total games, 74 were not working.

5. **Remaining Good Games**:
   - The number of games that worked out can be calculated by subtracting the number of non-working games from the total number of games purchased.
   - Number of good games = Total games - Non-working games

6. **Set Up Equation**:
   - We know that the number of good games is also equal to the number of games he ended up with.

7. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Let's express the equation in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     \text{Number of good games} = 27 + x - 74
     \]
   - Simplify the right side:
     \[
     \text{Number of good games} = 27 + x - 74
     \]

8. **Determine the Final Answer**:
   - Since we need to find the number of games he ended up with, which should match the expression above, we see that \( x \) must balance out the equation such that the remaining games are indeed what he ends up with.

Given that the number of good games equals \( 27 + x - 74 \), we can conclude that the total number of games he ends up with is simply the sum of the games he originally had plus the ones he purchased minus those that weren't working.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                     ! Carol was playing ! a trivia game. In the first round ; she ! scored : 17 ! points and ; in ! the second round she scored . 6 : points. In the last round she . lost 16 ! points. How : many . points ? did ! she ; have ? at ? the : end of ! the ; game? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of points Carol had after all three rounds.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Points from Each Round
- **First Round**: Carol scored 17 points.
- **Second Round**: Carol scored 6 points.
- **Third Round (Final)**: Carol lost 16 points.

### Step 2: Sum Up All Scores
We add up the scores from all three rounds to find out her total score.

\[
\text{Total Score} = \text{Points from First Round} + \text{Points from Second Round} - \text{Points Lost in Third Round}
\]

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[
\text{Total Score} = 17 + 6 - 16
\]

### Step 3: Perform the Calculation
Now let's do the arithmetic:

\[
17 + 6 = 23
\]
\[
23 - 16 = 7
\]

So, Carol has a total of 7 points at the end of the game.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. **Total number of boxes**: Dave bought 12 boxes.
2. **Number of pieces per box**: Each box contains 3 pieces.
3. **Pieces given away**: Dave gave 5 boxes worth of candies to his little brother.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces in all the boxes before giving any away:

- Total number of pieces = Number of boxes × Pieces per box
- Total number of pieces = 12 boxes × 3 pieces/box
- Total number of pieces = 36 pieces

Next, we need to find out how many pieces Dave still has after giving away some:

- Remaining pieces = Total number of pieces - Pieces given away
- Remaining pieces = 36 pieces - 5 pieces (since he gave away 5 boxes)
- Remaining pieces = 31 pieces

So, the final answer is: Dave still has **31 pieces**.<|im_end|>",21,21.0,31.0

<|im_start|>waiter
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the total number of customers served**:
   - The waiter initially had 39 customers.
   - He added an additional 12 customers during the lunch rush.
   - Therefore, the total number of customers served = 39 + 12 = 51.

2. **Determine the fraction of customers who left a tip**:
   - We know that 49% (or 0.49) of the customers didn't leave a tip.
   
3. **Calculate the number of customers who left a tip**:
   - To find out how many customers left a tip, we need to calculate 51% of the total number of customers.
   - Number of customers who left a tip = 51 * (1 - 0.49).

Let's perform the calculation:

\[
51 \times (1 - 0.49) = 51 \times 0.51 = 26.01
\]

Since the number of customers must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number if necessary. In this case, the result should be exactly 26 because 0.01 doesn't change the integer count.

So, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 26 customers.<|im_end|>",2,2.0,26.0

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of apples given away for lunch:**
   - They gave 5 apples per student.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of students.
   - Therefore, the total number of apples given away is \( 5n \).

2. **Calculate the remaining apples after distributing them:**
   - Initially, there were 50 apples in the cafeteria.
   - After giving away \( 5n \) apples, the remaining apples are \( 50 - 5n \).

3. **Find out how many pies can be made from the remaining apples:**
   - Each pie requires 5 apples.
   - To find out how many pies can be made, we divide the remaining apples by 5.

Let's denote the number of students as \( n \). We know that the total number of apples given away equals 50. So, we have:
\[ 5n = 50 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{50}{5} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

So, there are 10 students. Now, substituting \( n = 10 \) back into our equation for the remaining apples:
\[ 50 - 5n = 50 - 5(10) \]
\[ 50 - 50 = 0 \]

This means there are no apples left over because all 50 apples were distributed. However, since making pies requires at least one apple (as each pie needs 5 apples), we cannot make any pies with the remaining apples.

Therefore, the number of pies that can be made is:

To determine Frank's final score from the trivia game, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of questions Frank answered correctly in each half.
2. Multiply the number of correct answers per half by the value assigned to each question (which is 3 points).
3. Sum the scores from both halves to get the total score.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of questions Frank answered correctly in each half.
- In the first half, Frank answered 3 questions correctly.
- In the second half, Frank answered 2 questions correctly.

### Step 2: Multiply the number of correct answers per half by the value assigned to each question.
- Each question is worth 3 points.
- For the first half: \(3 \text{ questions} \times 3 \text{ points/question} = 9 \text{ points}\)
- For the second half: \(2 \text{ questions} \times 3 \text{ points/question} = 6 \text{ points}\)

### Step 3: Sum the scores from both halves to get the total score.
- Total score = Score from the first half + Score from the second half

To determine how many pieces of winter clothing Zoe has in total, we need to consider both the number of scarves and mittens she finds in each box and then sum these quantities for all eight boxes.

1. **Identify the number of items per box:**
   - Each box contains \(4\) scarves.
   - Each box also contains \(6\) mittens.

2. **Calculate the total number of items in one box:**
   \[
   \text{Items per box} = 4 \text{ (scarves)} + 6 \text{ (mittens)}

3. **Determine the total number of boxes:**
   - There are \(8\) boxes.

4. **Calculate the total number of items across all boxes:**
   \[
   \text{Total items} = \text{Items per box} \times \text{Number of boxes}

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. Determine how much one deck costs.
2. Calculate how many decks Frank bought.
3. Calculate how many decks Frank's friend bought.
4. Find out how much Frank spent on his decks.
5. Find out how much Frank's friend spent on their decks.
6. Add both amounts together to get the total cost.

Let's go through these steps in detail:

### Step 1: Determine how much one deck costs
We know that Frank and his friend bought 7 decks in total for $7! (which is 5040). Therefore, the cost per deck can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost per deck} = \frac{\$7!}{\text{Number of decks}} = \frac{5040}{7} = \$720 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many decks Frank bought
Frank bought 3 decks.

### Step 3: Calculate how many decks Frank's friend bought
Since Frank and his friend together bought 7 decks, and Frank bought 3 decks, then Frank's friend must have bought \(7 - 3\) decks, which equals 4 decks.

### Step 4: Find out how much Frank spent on his decks
Frank spent $720 on each deck, so he spent:
\[ \text{Total amount Frank spent} = 3 \times \$720 = \$2160 \]

### Step 5: Find out how much Frank's friend spent on their decks
Frank's friend also spent $720 on each deck, but since they only bought 4 decks, they spent:
\[ \text{Total amount Frank's friend spent} = 4 \times \$720 = \$2880 \]

### Step 6: Add both amounts together to get the total cost
Finally, we add the amounts Frank and his friend spent to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$2160 + \$2880 = \$5040 \]

So, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of shirts:**
   - Sam has 40 short sleeve shirts.
   - Sam also has 23 long sleeve shirts.
   - Total number of shirts = 40 (short sleeves) + 23 (long sleeves)
   \[
   \text{Total number of shirts} = 40 + 23 = 63
   \]

2. **Calculate the fraction of shirts that have been washed so far:**
   - Sam has washed 29 out of 63 shirts.
   - Fraction of shirts washed so far = \(\frac{29}{63}\)

3. **Convert the fraction to its decimal form for easier calculation:**
   \[
   \frac{29}{63} \approx 0.4615\ldots
   \]
   This means approximately 46.15% of the shirts have been washed.

4. **Calculate the number of shirts that have not been washed yet:**
   - Number of shirts not washed = Total number of shirts - Number of shirts washed
   \[
   \text{Number of shirts not washed} = 63 - 29 = 34
   \]

Therefore, Sam still needs to wash 34 shirts.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 34.<|im_end|>",34,34.0,34.0
