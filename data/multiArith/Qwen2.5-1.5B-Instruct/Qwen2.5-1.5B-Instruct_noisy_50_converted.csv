To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of songs**: Paige initially has 11 songs.
2. **Songs deleted**: She deletes 9 songs.
   - After deleting, the remaining number of songs = Initial number - Deleted songs
   - Remaining songs = 11 - 9 = 2.

3. **New songs added**: She adds 8 more songs.
   - The total number after adding = Remaining songs + New songs
   - Total songs = 2 + 8 = 10.

Therefore, the final number of songs on her MP3 player is **10**.<|im_end|>",10,10.0,10.0

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Total number of participants**:
   - There are 39 girls.
   - There are 4 boys.
   
   Total participants = 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 people.

2. **Number of successful attempts**:
   - Only 26 of them got called back.

3. **Calculate the number of students who did not make the cut**:
   - Subtract the number of successful attempts from the total number of participants.
   
   Number of students who did not make the cut = Total participants - Successful attempts
   
   Number of students who did not make the cut = 43 (total participants) - 26 (successful attempts)

4. **Perform the subtraction**:
   \[
   43 - 26 = 17

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of bags Megan recycled.
Megan initially had 14 bags but didn't recycle 5 of them.

- Total bags = 14 (initial) - 5 (not recycled)
  
\[ \text{Total bags recycled} = 14 - 5 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total points Megan earned from recycling these bags.
Since Megan earns 8 points for each bag recycled, we multiply the total number of bags recycled by 8.

- Points earned = (\(14 - 5\)) × 8

Let's perform the calculation:

\[ \text{Points earned} = (9) \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Points earned} = 72 \]

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of roses sold.
April started with 13 roses. After the sale, she has 4 roses left. Therefore, the number of roses sold is:

\[ \text{Number of roses sold} = \text{Initial number of roses} - \text{Number of roses left} \]
\[ \text{Number of roses sold} = 13 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of roses sold} = 9 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the roses.
Each rose costs $4. So, if April sold 9 roses at $4 each, her total revenue can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Number of roses sold} \times \text{Price per rose} \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 9 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 36 \]

Therefore, the amount of money April earned from the sale of the roses is **$36**.<|im_end|>",36,36.0,36.0

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of shirts Ned needed to wash:**
   - Ned needs to wash 9 short-sleeve shirts.
   - Ned also needs to wash 21 long-sleeve shirts.

   Total number of shirts = 9 (short-sleeves) + 21 (long-sleeves)
   
   \[
   \text{Total number of shirts} = 30
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of shirts Ned actually washed:**
   - Ned washed 29 shirts in total.

3. **Subtract the number of shirts Ned actually washed from the total number of shirts required:**

   Number of shirts not washed = Total number of shirts - Number of shirts washed
   
   \[
   \text{Number of shirts not washed} = 30 - 29 = 1

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of attendees:**
   - The company invited 47 people.
   - Out of these, 7 did not attend.

2. **Calculate the number of attendees who actually attended:**
   \[
   \text{Number of attendees} = \text{Total invitations} - \text{People who didn't attend}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of attendees} = 47 - 7 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine how many tables are needed if each table holds 5 people:**
   - We have 40 attendees.
   - Each table can hold 5 people.

4. **Divide the total number of attendees by the capacity per table:**
   \[
   \text{Number of tables needed} = \frac{\text{Total attendees}}{\text{Capacity per table}}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Number of Books:**
   - Tom initially has 5 books.

2. **Books Sold:**
   - Tom sells 4 out of his initial 5 books.
   
   Calculation:  
   \[
   5 - 4 = 1 \text{ book remaining}
   \]

3. **Money Earned from Selling Books:**
   - We need to calculate how much money Tom made from selling these 4 books. Let's assume the price per book is $x$ (since this value isn't provided, we'll use an assumed price for calculation purposes).
   
   Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Total Money} = 4 \times x
   \]
   
   So, Tom makes $4x in total.

4. **Spending on New Books:**
   - Tom uses the money he earned ($4x) to buy 38 new books.
   
   Since the price per book is $x$, we can write:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 38 books} = 38 \times x
   \]
   
   Given that he spent all his earnings on buying these 38 books, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   4x = 38x
   \]
   
   Simplifying,
   \[
   4x = 38x
   \]
   
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x = 38x
   \]
   
   Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   4x = 38x \\
   4x - 38x = 0 \\
   -34x = 0 \\
   x = 0
   \]
   
   Since \(x\) cannot be zero (as it represents the price per book), let's re-evaluate our approach. It seems there was an error in assuming the price or quantity values directly. Let's correct this:

5. **Correcting the Approach:**
   - Instead, we should consider the total amount of money Tom earned from selling 4 books and then use that to determine how many books he could actually buy.
   
   From the previous step where we found that he sold 4 books worth some amount, say \(A\). Then, he bought 38 books for the same amount \(A\).

6. **Final Calculation:**
   - To find out how many books Tom would have after using the money he earned, we need to divide the total number of books he originally had by the number of books he buys with the money he earns from selling 4 books.
   
   Assuming he sells each book for $1 (a common assumption without specific prices given),
   \[
   A = 4 \times 1 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   
   Now, he spends this $4 on 38 books:
   \[
   \text{Number of books bought} = \frac{4}{38} \approx 0.1053 \text{ books per dollar}
   \]
   
   Therefore, the total number of books he would end up with after spending the money is:
   \[
   \text{Total books} = 5 + 4 - 38 = 5 - 33 = -28 \text{ books}
   \]

This indicates an inconsistency because Tom cannot have negative books. Revisiting the steps, the key point is realizing that the logic assumes he can sell exactly 4 books at $1 each and spend it on 38 books which might not align with real-world practicality.

So, the correct conclusion based on logical steps would be that Tom cannot realistically achieve this scenario as described due to impractical assumptions about book sales and purchases. The realistic interpretation would involve revising assumptions around pricing or transaction amounts. 

**The final answer is:** Tom would not have any books if he follows the exact description provided, indicating a possible misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the problem constraints.<|im_end|>",39,39.0,38.0

To determine how many shelves Jerry's fridge can fill, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of sodas:**
   - Regular sodas: 41
   - Diet sodas: 22
   
   Total sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
                  = 41 + 22
                  = 63

2. **Determine how many shelves are needed for the total number of sodas:**
   - Each shelf holds 9 sodas.

   Number of shelves required = Total sodas / Sodas per shelf
                             = 63 / 9
                             = 7

Emily started with 41 seeds.

She planted 29 seeds in one large garden.

We need to find out how many seeds were planted in each of the small gardens.

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining seeds after planting in the large garden.
Subtract the number of seeds planted in the large garden from the total number of seeds:
\[ \text{Remaining seeds} = 41 - 29 = 12 \]

### Step 3: Determine how many seeds were planted in each small garden.
Since each small garden received 4 seeds, we divide the remaining seeds by 4:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of books left for Mike**

- Total number of books = 82
- Number of books taken by the librarian = 10

Number of books left for Mike = Total books - Books taken by librarian
= 82 - 10
= 72

So far, we have:
- Total books: 82
- Books left for Mike: 72

**Step 2: Calculate the number of shelves needed**

- Number of books per shelf = 9
- Number of books left for Mike = 72

Number of shelves needed = Total books left / Books per shelf
= 72 / 9
= 8

So far, we have:
- Total books: 82
- Books left for Mike: 72
- Number of shelves needed: 8

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of customers who left a tip:**
   - The total number of customers is 7.
   - \( \frac{5}{7} \) of these customers didn't leave a tip.

2. **Calculate the number of customers who left a tip:**
   - Number of customers who left a tip = Total customers - Customers who didn't leave a tip
   - Number of customers who left a tip = \( 7 - (7 \times \frac{5}{7}) \)
   - Simplify inside the parentheses first: \( 7 - 5 \)

3. **Simplify the expression to find the number of customers who tipped:**
   - \( 7 - 5 = 2 \)

4. **Calculate the amount of money earned per customer who tipped:**
   - Each customer who tipped received $3.

5. **Multiply the number of customers who tipped by the amount they each received:**
   - Money earned = Number of customers who tipped × Amount per tipper
   - Money earned = \( 2 \times 3 \)

6. **Perform the multiplication to get the final amount:**
   - Money earned = \( 6 \)

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of lawns John could have mowed.**
John was supposed to mow 15 lawns.

**Step 2: Subtract the number of lawns John didn't mow from the total number of lawns he was supposed to mow.**
He forgot to mow 7 lawns.

\[ \text{Total lawns} = 15 \]
\[ \text{Lawns not mowed} = 7 \]

\[ \text{Lawns mowed} = 15 - 7 = 8 \]

So, John actually mowed 8 lawns.

**Step 3: Calculate the amount of money John earned per lawn.**
John earns $8 per lawn.

**Step 4: Multiply the number of lawns John mowed by the amount he earns per lawn to find out his total earnings.**

\[ \text{Earnings per lawn} = \$8 \]
\[ \text{Number of lawns mowed} = 8 \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Sure! Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

1. **Initial Number of Puppies:**
   - The shelter initially has 5 puppies.
   
2. **Puppies Added Later:**
   - Another 35 puppies were added to the shelter.
   - Total number of puppies now = Initial puppies + Additional puppies
     \[
     5 + 35 = 40
     \]

3. **Total Number of Puppies:**
   - After adding more puppies, there are 40 puppies in total.

4. **Rate of Adoption:**
   - Puppies are adopted at a rate of 8 per day.

5. **Time Calculation:**
   - We need to determine how many days it will take for all 40 puppies to be adopted.
   - Since 8 puppies are adopted each day, we divide the total number of puppies by the daily adoption rate.
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total number of puppies}}{\text{Daily adoption rate}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{40}{8}

   - The new building needs 9 windows.

2. **Calculate the number of windows remaining to be installed:**
   - Since 6 windows have already been installed,
     \[
     9 - 6 = 3 \text{ windows}
     \]

3. **Find out how many hours it took to install these remaining windows:**
   - It takes 6 hours to install each window.
   - Therefore, for 3 windows,
     \[
     3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Conclude that it will take the same amount of time as installing all 6 windows:**
   - Since it takes 6 hours to install one window,
     \[
     6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ hours}
     \]
     (because there are 3 more windows left)

So, it will take him 18 hours to install the rest of the windows.

                    !  A waiter at ; 'The : Greasy ? Spoon' restaurant ! had 26 ; customers : to ? wait ? on. During the ? lunch rush he . added another 27 customers. If ! 27 of the customers ; didn't leave him a tip, how many customers ! did leave a tip? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of customers**: The waiter initially had 26 customers.
   - Let's denote this as \( C_0 = 26 \).

2. **Lunch rush addition**: During the lunch rush, he added another 27 customers.
   - Total number of customers after adding more: \( C_{\text{new}} = C_0 + 27 \)
   - Substituting \( C_0 \):
     \[
     C_{\text{new}} = 26 + 27 = 53
     \]

3. **Customers who didn't leave a tip**:
   - According to the problem, 27 of these customers didn't leave a tip.

4. **Calculate the total number of customers who left a tip**:
   - Subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers.
   - Number of customers who left a tip: \( T = C_{\text{total}} - 27 \)

Let's do the calculations for clarity:

- \( C_{\text{total}} = 53 \) (after adding more customers during the lunch rush).
- \( T = C_{\text{total}} - 27 \)
- \( T = 53 - 27 \)
- \( T = 26 \)

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 26 customers left a tip.<|im_end|>",26,26.0,26.0

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of bears**: The toy store initially had 17 giant stuffed bears.

2. **Additional shipment received**: They received an additional shipment containing 10 more bears.

3. **Total number of bears after receiving the shipment**: We need to add these two numbers together.
   \[
   17 + 10 = 27
   \]

4. **Number of bears per shelf**: Each shelf can hold 9 bears.

5. **Calculate the number of shelves needed**: To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of bears (27) by the number of bears that fit on one shelf (9).
   \[
   \frac{27}{9} = 3
   \]

Therefore, the toy store used 3 shelves to display all the bears.

                <|im_end|>

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of flowers Wendy has.
Wendy picked 103 flowers.

### Step 2: Calculate the maximum number of bouquets she can make if all flowers were used.
Each bouquet contains 8 flowers. To find out how many full bouquets she can make from 103 flowers, we divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet.

\[ \text{Number of bouquets} = \frac{\text{Total flowers}}{\text{Flowers per bouquet}} \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ \text{Number of bouquets} = \frac{103}{8} \]

Perform the division:

\[ \text{Number of bouquets} = 12.875 \]

Since Wendy cannot make a fraction of a bouquet, she can only make whole bouquets. Therefore, she can make 12 bouquets completely filled with 8 flowers each.

### Step 3: Account for the flowers that wilted.
If 47 flowers wilted, we need to subtract these from the total number of flowers available.

\[ \text{Available flowers after wilting} = 103 - 47 \]
\[ \text{Available flowers after wilting} = 56 \]

### Step 4: Recalculate the maximum number of bouquets she can now make.
Now, with 56 flowers remaining, we again calculate how many complete bouquets she can make.

\[ \text{Number of bouquets} = \frac{\text{Remaining flowers}}{\text{Flowers per bouquet}} \]

Substitute the new values:

\[ \text{Number of bouquets} = \frac{56}{8} \]

Perform the division:

\[ \text{Number of bouquets} = 7 \]

Therefore, Wendy can still make **7** bouquets, each containing 8 flowers, using the remaining flowers.<|im_end|>",7,7.0,8.0

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of books Adam originally had.
Adam originally had 48 books.

### Step 2: Calculate how many books Adam sold.
Adam sold \( \frac{19}{48} \) of his books.

### Step 3: Find out how many books were left after selling some.
First, calculate \( \frac{19}{48} \):
\[ \frac{19}{48} = 0.395833... \]
This means Adam sold approximately 0.395833 parts (or books) of his total collection.

Now, multiply the total number of books by this fraction to find out how many books were sold:
\[ 48 \times 0.395833... = 18.76413... \]

So, Adam sold approximately 18.76413 books.

### Step 4: Subtract the number of books sold from the original amount.
Subtracting the books sold from the original 48 books gives us:
\[ 48 - 18.76413 = 29.23587 \]

So, Adam has approximately 29.23587 books remaining.

### Step 5: Calculate how many books Adam bought with the money he earned.
Adam spent all the money he earned on buying 38 new books.

### Step 6: Add the number of books Adam bought back to the number of books he still has.
Adding the 38 new books to the 29.23587 books Adam has left gives us:
\[ 29.23587 + 38 = 67.23587 \]

To determine how many vans are needed for Nancy's class field trip to the zoo, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of people:**
   - There are 12 students.
   - There are 3 adults.
   - Total number of people = Students + Adults = 12 + 3 = 15.

2. **Determine the capacity of one van:**
   - Each van can hold 5 people.

3. **Calculate the number of vans required:**
   - To find out how many vans are needed, divide the total number of people by the capacity of one van.
   - Number of vans = Total number of people / Capacity per van = 15 / 5 = 3.

Therefore, Nancy's class will need **3 vans** to transport all the students and adults to the zoo.<|im_end|>",3,3.0,3.0

                    question:
                     For a birthday party Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. If his fridge would only ? hold 7 . on each shelf, how many shelves , would he fill up? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many shelves Tom will need to fill, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of sodas:**
   - Regular sodas: 4
   - Diet sodas: 52
   - Total sodas = 4 + 52 = 56

2. **Determine the capacity per shelf:**
   - Each shelf can hold a certain number of sodas.

3. **Find out how many shelves fit into one capacity:**
   - We know that Tom has 7 shelves available.
   - To find out how many shelves fit into one capacity, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of shelves.

\[ \text{Number of shelves} = \frac{\text{Total number of sodas}}{\text{Number of shelves}} \]

4. **Substitute the values:**

\[ \text{Number of shelves} = \frac{56}{7} \]

5. **Perform the division:**

\[ \text{Number of shelves} = 8 \]

So, Tom would fill up **8 shelves** if his fridge could accommodate all 56 sodas in the given conditions. However, since his fridge only holds 7 shelves, he cannot fill more than 7 shelves completely because each shelf must be filled at least partially.

Therefore, Tom would have to choose between filling as many full shelves as possible (up to 7) or leaving some shelves empty depending on the specific requirements for each shelf capacity. But based solely on the provided information, he would fill up **8 shelves**, but this might not be feasible due to the limited space in his fridge.<|im_end|>",8,8.0,8.0

   So after using 20 apples, there are 18 apples left in the cafeteria.

3. **Additional apples bought**:
   - They buy 28 more apples.

   Calculation:
   \[

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total number of trays**: Luke needs to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another table.
   - Total trays = 20 + 16 = 36 trays.

2. **Determine the carrying capacity per trip**: Luke can carry 4 trays at once.
   
3. **Calculate the number of trips needed**:
   - To find out how many times Luke has to go back to the cafeteria (since he can't leave any trays behind), we divide the total number of trays by his carrying capacity.
   - Number of trips = Total trays ÷ Carrying capacity per trip = 36 ÷ 4 = 9 trips.

Therefore, Luke will have to make 9 trips to pick up all the trays.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many apples were left after handing out some to students.
2. Calculate how many pies can be made from the remaining apples.

Let's start with the first step:

Step 1: Determine how many apples were left after handing out some to students.
- Initially, there were 96 apples in the cafeteria.
- They handed out 42 apples to students.
- Therefore, the number of apples left = Initial number of apples - Number of apples handed out
= 96 - 42 = 54 apples

Now let's move on to the second step:

Step 2: Calculate how many pies can be made from the remaining apples.
- Each pie requires 6 apples.
- To find out how many pies can be made, divide the total number of remaining apples by the number of apples needed per pie.
= Remaining apples ÷ Apples per pie
= 54 ÷ 6 = 9 pies

Therefore, the cafeteria could make 9 pies using the remaining apples.<|im_end|>",9,9.0,9.0

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of brownies Tiffany needs.**

- Tiffany wants to have a total of 17 brownies.

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of flour used so far.**

- Tiffany uses 8 cups of flour per brownie.
- She has baked 8 brownies.

\[
\text{Total flour used} = \text{Number of brownies} \times \text{Flour per brownie}
\]

\[
\text{Total flour used} = 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ cups}
\]

**Step 3: Subtract the amount of flour already used from the total amount needed.**

- Total number of brownies required: 17
- Flour already used: 64 cups

\[
\text{Remaining flour needed} = \text{Total number of brownies} - \text{Flour already used}
\]

\[
\text{Remaining flour needed} = 17 - 64
\]

Since 17 is less than 64, it's clear that Tiffany doesn't need any more flour because she has enough flour for all the brownies she intends to bake.

**Conclusion:**
Tiffany **still needs no additional cups of flour** since she only needs 17 brownies and she can make those using up to 64 cups of flour (which she actually has).

Therefore, the final answer is:

To determine the number of bad carrots, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of carrots picked**:
   - Carol picked 29 carrots.
   - Her mother picked 16 carrots.
   
   Total number of carrots = \( 29 + 16 \).

2. **Find out how many carrots were good**:
   - Only 38% of the carrots are good.
   
   Therefore, the number of good carrots = \( 0.38 \times (Total\ Number\ of\ Carrots) \).

3. **Subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots** to find the number of bad carrots.

Let's perform these calculations step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of carrots picked
\[ Total\ Number\ of\ Carrots = 29 + 16 \]
\[ Total\ Number\ of\ Carrots = 45 \]

### Step 2: Find out how many carrots were good
\[ Good\ Carrots = 0.38 \times 45 \]
\[ Good\ Carrots = 17.1 \]

Since the number of carrots must be an integer, let’s round down because you can’t pick a fraction of a carrot:
\[ Good\ Carrots \approx 17 \]

### Step 3: Subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots to find the number of bad carrots
\[ Bad\ Carrots = Total\ Number\ of\ Carrots - Good\ Carrots \]
\[ Bad\ Carrots = 45 - 17 \]
\[ Bad\ Carrots = 28 \]

Therefore, the number of bad carrots is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of players:**
   - Initially, there were 8 friends playing the game.

2. **Add the new players to the group:**
   - When 2 more players joined the game, the total number of players increased.
   
3. **Calculate the total number of players after the addition:**
   - Initial number (8) + Number added (2) = Total number of players.

4. **Given that each player has 6! lives:**
   - We need to calculate the factorial of 6 to find out how many lives each player has.
   
5. **Compute the factorial of 6:**
   - \(6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1\).

Let's compute these calculations:

- Calculate the factorial of 6:
  \[
  6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720
  \]

Therefore, each player has 720 lives.

6. **Find the total number of lives for all players combined:**
   - Multiply the total number of players by the number of lives per player.

So, we get:
\[
\text{Total lives} = \text{Number of players} \times \text{Lives per player}
\]
\[
\text{Total lives} = (\text{Initial players} + \text{New players}) \times \text{Lives per player}

                    question:
                    ?  For . Halloween Bianca received 78 pieces of ? candy. . She ate 30 , pieces then ! placed the rest into piles with 8 ! in ! each ; pile. How many piles , could ? she make? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of candies after eating some:**
   - Bianca initially had 78 pieces of candy.
   - She ate 30 pieces.
   - Therefore, the remaining candies are \( 78 - 30 = 48 \).

2. **Calculate how many full piles of 8 can be made from the remaining candies:**
   - We need to divide the remaining 48 candies by 8.
   - Perform the division: \( 48 ÷ 8 = 6 \).

So, the final answer is that Bianca can make 6 piles of candy with 8 candies in each pile.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 6.<|im_end|>",6,6.0,6.0

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of players**:
   - Initially, there were 5 friends playing the video game.

2. **Additional players joining**:
   - 2 more players joined the game.

3. **Total initial number of players**:
   - \( 5 \) (initial players) + \( 2 \) (additional players) = \( 7 \) players in total.

4. **Number of lives per player**:
   - Each player has 8 lives.

5. **Total number of lives**:
   - To find the total number of lives, we multiply the total number of players by the number of lives each player has.
     \[
     \text{Total lives} = \text{Total number of players} \times \text{Lives per player}
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Total lives} = 7 \times 8 = 56

<|im_start|>waitress
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost for the group at the restaurant based on the given information.

Step 1: Determine the number of adults.
There are 11 people in total, but 2 of them are children. Therefore, the number of adults is:
\[ 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Step 2: Calculate the cost for the adults.
Each adult meal costs $8, so for 9 adults, the total cost would be:
\[ 9 \times \$8 = \$72 \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost for the children.
Since each kid eats for free, the total cost for the children does not apply here because they do not pay anything. Thus, there is no additional cost for the children.

Step 4: Add up all the costs.
The total cost for the group is the sum of the adult meals:
\[ \$72 + \$0 = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Initial number of books**: Roger starts with 25 books.
2. **Books sold**: Roger sells 21 books.
   - Subtract these from his initial amount: \( 25 - 21 = 4 \) books left.
3. **Money earned**: The money Roger earns from selling these books.
   - He uses the money to buy 30 new books.
4. **Calculate the total cost for the 30 new books**:
   - Let's denote the price per book as \( p \). Therefore, \( 30p = 30 \times 10 = 300 \) (assuming each book costs $10).
5. **Determine the remaining money after buying 30 new books**:
   - Money spent on new books: \( 300 \)
   - Remaining money: \( 25 - 21 + 300 = 274 \) (since he initially had some money but we're not sure if it was zero).

Since we don't know the exact initial amount, let's assume he had enough money to cover the cost without borrowing or having negative amounts in his bank account.

6. **Add back any borrowed funds or additional income**:
   - Assume he has no further information about additional income or borrowing, so the remaining money remains $274$.

Now, let's add up the steps:

- Initial books: 25
- Sold books: 21
- Books left after sale: 4
- Money earned from selling: $274$
- Cost of 30 new books: $300$

So, Roger will have:

\[ 25 - 21 + 300 = 304 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} 304 books.<|im_end|>",34,34.0,304.0

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine the amount of money Frank has after buying mower blades**

Frank initially made $19. After spending $11 on mower blades, we subtract that amount from his initial earnings.

\[ \text{Money left} = \$19 - \$11 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the remaining money**

Performing the subtraction in Step 1:

\[ \$19 - \$11 = \$8 \]

So, Frank has $8 left after buying the mower blades.

**Step 3: Determine how much money is needed for one game**

Each game costs $2.

**Step 4: Calculate how many games Frank can buy with the remaining money**

To find out how many games Frank can afford, divide the total money left by the cost per game.

\[ \text{Number of games} = \frac{\$8}{\$2} \]

**Step 5: Perform the division**

\[ \frac{\$8}{\$2} = 4 \]

Therefore, Frank can buy **4** games with the money he has left.

To determine how long Mike's money will last, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate total earnings**
Mike earned $14 from mowing lawns and $26 from weed eating.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$14 + \$26 \]

Let's do this calculation first:

Mike spends $5 per week on various expenses.

\[ \text{Weekly spending} = \$5 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks the money will last**

We divide the total amount of money by the weekly spending to find out how many weeks it will last.

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Weekly spending}} \]
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$40}{\$5} \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pictures taken:**
   - Pictures at the zoo: 41
   - Pictures at the museum: 29
   \[
   \text{Total pictures} = 41 + 29 = 70
   \]

2. **Determine how many pictures were deleted:**
   - Pictures deleted: 15

3. **Subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures:**
   \[
   \text{Pictures remaining} = 70 - 15 = 55
   \]

Therefore, the number of pictures that Gwen still has after deleting some is \(55\). 

The final answer is: \(\boxed{55}\)<|im_end|>",55,55.0,55.0

                    question:
                     A ; pet shelter had 2 puppies when another 34 were brought in. If 4 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how long it will take for all the puppies to be adopted if 4 puppies are adopted each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of puppies:**
   - Initially, there are 2 puppies.
   - Another 34 puppies are brought in.
   
   Total number of puppies = Initial puppies + Additional puppies
   \[
   2 + 34 = 36
   \]

2. **Determine the rate at which puppies are adopted per day:**
   - The shelter adopts 4 puppies each day.

3. **Calculate the time required to adopt all puppies:**
   - We need to find out how many days it takes to reach zero puppies (since they are all adopted).
   - Let \( d \) represent the number of days needed.
   - Each day, 4 puppies are adopted, so after \( d \) days, the total number of adopted puppies will be \( 4d \).

   Since the total number of puppies initially is 36, we set up the equation:
   \[
   4d = 36
   \]

4. **Solve for \( d \):**
   \[
   d = \frac{36}{4} = 9
   \]

Therefore, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Total number of clothes**: Will has a total of 59 pieces of clothing.
2. **Clothes already in one load**: He puts 32 of these clothes in one load.
3. **Remaining clothes**: We need to find out how many pieces of clothing will be left after putting 32 in one load.

   Calculation: Total clothes - Clothes already in one load = Remaining clothes
             59 - 32 = 27

4. **Number of remaining clothes per load**: Now we need to determine how many of the remaining clothes will fit into 9 equal loads.

   Calculation: Remaining clothes / Number of loads = Pieces per load
              27 ÷ 9 = 3

Therefore, each small load can contain 3 pieces of clothing.

<|im_start|>user
Adam bought 2! boxes of chocolate candy and 5 boxes of caramel candy.
Step 1: Calculate the number of chocolate candies in the boxes.
Each box contains 4 pieces, so for 2 boxes, we multiply 2 by 4.
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]
So, Adam has 8 pieces of chocolate candy.

Step 2: Calculate the number of caramel candies in the boxes.
Again, each box contains 4 pieces, and Adam bought 5 boxes, so we multiply 5 by 4.
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
So, Adam has 20 pieces of caramel candy.

Step 3: Add the amounts of both types of candies to find the total.
\[ 8 (chocolate) + 20 (caramel) = 28 \]
Therefore, Adam has a total of 28 pieces of candy.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the price per item.
2. Calculate the total cost for each type of flower.
3. Sum up the costs for all items.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Determine the price per item
- The problem states that each flower (in this case, each ""flower"") is $6.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for each type of flower
- **Roses**: Katie bought 5 roses.
  - Cost = Number of roses × Price per rose
  - Cost = 5 × $6
  - Cost = $30

- **Daisies**: Katie also bought 5 daisies.
  - Cost = Number of daisies × Price per daisy
  - Cost = 5 × $6
  - Cost = $30

### Step 3: Sum up the costs for all items
- Total cost = Cost of roses + Cost of daisies
- Total cost = $30 + $30
- Total cost = $60

Therefore, the total amount Katie spent on her purchase is $60.

                    question:
                     At the schools book fair Victor bought 32 adventure books and ? 37 mystery books. If 16 of the books were used, how ; many new books did he buy? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of books Victor purchased initially and then subtract the number of used books from that total.

Step 1: Determine the initial total number of books.
- Victor bought 32 adventure books.
- Let's denote the unknown number of mystery books as \( x \).
- The total number of books before considering any used ones would be \( 32 + x \).

Step 2: Subtract the number of used books from the total.
- We know that 16 books were used.
- Therefore, the equation representing the remaining books after accounting for the used ones is \( (32 + x) - 16 = \text{remaining books} \).

Step 3: Simplify the equation.
- Simplifying the left side gives us \( 32 + x - 16 = \text{remaining books} \).
- This simplifies further to \( 16 + x = \text{remaining books} \).

Step 4: Solve for \( x \).
- Since we don't have more information about the total number of books or the distribution between mystery and adventure books, let's assume that all books were either mystery or adventure without overlapping. This means \( x \) could be either 0 or some value greater than 0 if there were both types but no overlap.
- Given the information provided, it seems the only logical assumption is that \( x \) represents the total number of mystery books since that is what was asked in the question.
- Therefore, \( x \) must represent the total number of mystery books.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of mystery books.
- From Step 4, we know \( x \) represents the total number of mystery books.
- Without additional information on the total number of books, we cannot calculate an exact number for \( x \). However, we can express the final answer in terms of \( x \).

Final Answer: The final answer is expressed in terms of \( x \), which represents the total number of mystery books Victor bought. If \( x \) is known, you can substitute it into the expression to find the exact number of mystery books. For example, if \( x = 37 \), then the final answer would be \( 37 \) new books (since all mystery books are new).<|im_end|>",53,53.0,37.0

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of carrots left after throwing some out.
Maria started with 48 carrots.

She threw out 11 carrots.

So, we need to subtract 11 from 48.

\[ 48 - 11 = 37 \]

After throwing out the carrots, Maria has 37 carrots left.

### Step 2: Add the additional carrots picked later.
Next, Maria picks up 15 more carrots.

So, we need to add 15 to the remaining 37 carrots.

\[ 37 + 15 = 52 \]

After picking up the additional carrots, Maria now has 52 carrots in total.

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the total number of carrots Maria has at the end of the day is **52**.<|im_end|>",52,52.0,52.0

**Step 2: First Sale**
- She sells 15 roses.
  
    - Let's calculate the number of roses left after selling 15 roses.
    
        \[
        50 - 15 = 35
        \]
    
    So, after selling 15 roses, she has 35 roses remaining.

**Step 3: Additional Picking**
- Later on, she picks up an additional 21 roses.
    
    - Now, let's add these to her current total (after selling):
    
        \[
        35 + 21 = 56
        \]

Adam then spent this money on 23 new books.

Since he bought 23 books using the money he earned from selling 11 books, we can write:
\[ 23 = M / (11 \times x) \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \).
From the equation above:
\[ 23 = M / (11x) \]
\[ 23 \times 11x = M \]
\[ M = 253x \]

We know that \( M \) is the money Adam earned from selling 11 books. We also know that \( M \) must be an integer because he only earns whole dollar amounts.

Given that Adam sold 11 books, if he sells at \( y \) dollars per book, then:
\[ M = 11y \]

Thus,
\[ 11y = 253x \]

This implies:
\[ y = \frac{253x}{11} \]

Since \( y \) represents the price Adam pays for each book he buys, and since he ends up paying less than what he received in sales due to the sale, \( x \) must be greater than or equal to 1 (since \( x \) is a positive integer representing the number of books he could sell). 

If \( x = 1 \), then \( y = 23 \), meaning Adam sells books at $23 each and buys books at $23 each, so he doesn't earn any profit.

If \( x > 1 \), then \( y < 23 \), implying Adam earns more than he spends, which means he has a net gain.

For simplicity, let's assume \( x = 1 \):
\[ M = 11 \times 23 = 253 \]

Therefore, Adam sold books at $23 each and bought books at $23 each.

### Step 4: Calculate the final number of books Adam has.
Initially, Adam had 33 books. He sold 11 books, so he now has:
\[ 33 - 11 = 22 \text{ books left} \]

Then, he uses the $253 to buy 23 new books.

After purchasing 23 new books, Adam will have:
\[ 22 + 23 = 45 \text{ books} \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{45}

2. **Lives Lost**: Subtract the number of lives lost from the initial number.
3. **Additional Lives Gained**: Add the number of additional lives gained to the result from step 2.

Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Initial Lives
Wendy starts with 43 lives.

### Step 2: Lives Lost
She loses 8 lives during the game.

\[ \text{Lives after losing} = 43 - 8 \]

Calculate \(43 - 8\):

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of cupcakes sold.
Carol initially made 19 cupcakes. She sold 6 of these cupcakes.

\[ \text{Total cupcakes sold} = 19 - 6 = 13 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the additional cupcakes made after selling some.
After selling 6 cupcakes, Carol made an additional 27 cupcakes.

- Coins per pile = 3
Total quarters = 5 * 3 = 15

For dimes:
- Number of piles = 5
- Coins per pile = 3
Total dimes = 5 * 3 = 15

Finally, we add the total number of quarters and dimes to find the overall total number of coins:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the total number of points Gwen and her friends earned from recycling paper, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of points Gwen earned.
Gwen recycled 5 pounds of paper.

- For every 3 pounds recycled, she earns 1 point.
  
  To find out how many points she earned, we can set up a proportion based on this ratio:
  
  \[
  \frac{1 \text{ point}}{3 \text{ pounds}}
  \]

  We know that Gwen recycled 5 pounds, so we can write the equation as follows:
  
  \[
  \frac{x}{5} = \frac{1}{3}
  \]

  Solving for \(x\):
  
  \[
  x = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \text{ points}
  \]

So, Gwen earned approximately **1.67 points**.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of points her friends earned.
Her friends recycled 13 pounds of paper.

- Similarly, for every 3 pounds recycled, her friends also earn 1 point.

  Using the same ratio as before:
  
  \[
  \frac{1 \text{ point}}{3 \text{ pounds}}
  \]

  We know that her friends recycled 13 pounds, so we can write the equation as follows:
  
  \[
  \frac{y}{13} = \frac{1}{3}
  \]

  Solving for \(y\):
  
  \[
  y = \frac{13}{3} \approx 4.33 \text{ points}
  \]

So, her friends earned approximately **4.33 points**.

### Step 3: Sum the points earned by Gwen and her friends.
Now, add the points earned by both Gwen and her friends together:
  
  \[
  1.67 + 4.33 = 6 \text{ points}
  \]

Therefore, the total number of points they earned is **6 points**.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total number of tickets needed:**
   - Haley bought 3 tickets for herself.
   - She also bought an unknown number of tickets for her friends (let's call this number \( x \)).
   - She also bought 5 extra tickets just in case.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   The total number of tickets can be represented as:
   \[
   3 + x + 5 = T
   \]
   where \( T \) represents the total number of tickets purchased.

3. **Determine the price per ticket:**
   Each ticket costs $4.

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   To find out how much Haley spent, we need to multiply the total number of tickets (\( T \)) by the price per ticket ($4).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   We know that the total number of tickets \( T \) must be an integer because you can't have a fraction of a ticket. Let's assume the maximum number of tickets she could buy without exceeding the total amount of money she has. If we don't know exactly how much money she has, we'll consider the most reasonable assumption based on typical concert prices.

6. **Check possible values for \( x \):**
   Since we're not given the exact amount of money she has, let's assume the maximum practical scenario:
   - If \( x = 7 \), then \( T = 3 + 7 + 5 = 15 \).
   - If \( x = 8 \), then \( T = 3 + 8 + 5 = 16 \).
   - If \( x = 9 \), then \( T = 3 + 9 + 5 = 17 \).

Since \( T \) needs to be a multiple of 4 (because each ticket costs $4), the only feasible value is when \( x = 7 \):
   \[
   T = 15
   \]

7. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 15 \times 4 = 60
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Haley spent is \(\boxed{60}\).<|im_end|>",32,32.0,60.0

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of chocolates in all the boxes.
Kaleb bought 14 boxes of chocolate.

Each box contains 6 pieces of chocolate.

Therefore, the total number of chocolates can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total chocolates} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Chocolates per box} \]
\[ \text{Total chocolates} = 14 \times 6 \]

Let's do the multiplication:
\[ 14 \times 6 = 84 \]

So, Kaleb initially had 84 pieces of chocolate.

### Step 2: Subtract the number of chocolates given away.
Kaleb gave 5 chocolates to his little brother.

Thus, the remaining number of chocolates after giving some away is:
\[ \text{Remaining chocolates} = \text{Total chocolates} - \text{Given chocolates} \]
\[ \text{Remaining chocolates} = 84 - 5 \]

Let's perform the subtraction:
\[ 84 - 5 = 79 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

1. **Calculate the total amount Mike spent:**
   - Mike spent $24 on new mower blades.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of $5 game purchases he made.
   
   The total amount spent can be represented as:
   \[
   24 + 5x = \text{Total Amount Spent}
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount Mike earned:**
   - Mike earned $69 in total.

3. **Set up an equation for the remaining money after spending:**
   - After spending some money, Mike has the remaining amount to spend or save.
   - Let \( y \) be the remaining money after his expenses.
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   69 - (24 + 5x) = y
   \]
   Simplify this expression:
   \[
   69 - 24 - 5x = y \implies 45 - 5x = y
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - We need to find out how much money Mike could buy with his remaining money (\( y \)).
   - Each game costs $5.
   - Let \( z \) be the number of games he bought.

   Therefore,
   \[
   5z = \text{Money spent on games} \quad \text{(since } 5 \times \text{Number of Games} = \text{Cost per Game} \times \text{Number of Games})
   \]
   
   So we have:
   \[
   5z = \frac{y}{5} \implies z = \frac{y}{25}
   \]

   Since \( y = 45 - 5x \), substitute \( y \) into the above equation:
   \[
   z = \frac{45 - 5x}{25}
   \]

5. **Substitute \( x \) back into the equation:**
   - To determine how many games Mike can buy, we need to know \( x \).
   - From the given information, we know that Mike spent $24 on mower blades and then spent more money on games.

   Now, let's calculate the value of \( x \):
   \[
   24 + 5x = \text{Total Amount Spent}
   \]
   Given that the total amount spent must equal the total amount earned minus the remaining money:
   \[
   24 + 5x = \text{Total Amount Spent}
   \]
   And since the total amount spent equals the total amount earned minus the remaining money:
   \[
   24 + 5x = 69 - (24 + 5x)
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   24 + 5x = 69 - 24 - 5x
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   24 + 5x = 45 - 5x
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 21 \implies x = \frac{21}{2} = 10.5
   \]

   Since \( x \) represents the number of games Mike bought, and it cannot be fractional, we conclude:

   Therefore, Mike can only buy whole numbers of games, so he buys 10 games because he can't buy half a game.

6. **Final Answer:**

Mike can buy 10 games with the money he had left. 

\[
\boxed{10}

2. **Calculate the time spent on each piece of furniture:**
   - Time per piece = 8 minutes.
   
3. **Determine the total time spent on all pieces:**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Determine total number of cookies**:
   - We know there are two types of cookies: chocolate chip (CC) and oatmeal (O).
   - The total number of cookies is given as `! 5 : chocolate chip ?` + `19 ? oatmeal cookies`.

2. **Calculate the number of baggies based on the total number of cookies**:
   - Each baggie contains 8 cookies.
   - To find out how many baggies Maria can make from the total number of cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 8.

3. **Consider the constraints**:
   - Since the total number of cookies is already provided (`! 5 : chocolate chip ?` + `19 ? oatmeal cookies`), we need to ensure that these numbers add up correctly.

4. **Perform division**:
   - Let’s denote the total number of cookies as \( C \).

Given:
- Total cookies = `! 5 : chocolate chip ?` + `19 ? oatmeal cookies`
- Cookies per baggie = 8

We need to calculate the number of baggies Maria can make.

Since the total number of cookies is already provided, let's assume the values for the chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies:

- Suppose the chocolate chip cookies are `C_C` and the oatmeal cookies are `C_O`.
- Then, the total number of cookies is `C_C + C_O`.

Now, if Maria makes one baggie, she uses 8 cookies. Therefore, the number of baggies she can make is:

\[ \text{Number of baggies} = \left\lfloor \frac{\text{Total number of cookies}}{8} \right\rfloor \]

Where `\(\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor\)` represents the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to `x`.

Without specific values for `C_C` and `C_O`, we cannot perform an exact calculation. However, assuming all cookies were used without any leftovers, the number of baggies would be calculated using the formula above.

For example, if Maria has 67 cookies in total, then she could make:

\[ \text{Number of baggies} = \left\lfloor \frac{67}{8} \right\rfloor = 8 \]

So, the maximum number of baggies Maria can make, considering her cookie preferences and the requirement that she uses all her cookies, is determined by dividing the total number of cookies by 8.

Therefore, the final answer depends on the total number of cookies Maria has. If she has 67 cookies, she can make 8 baggies. 

To summarize: 
- Given the total number of cookies, divide by 8 to get the number of baggies. 

If you provide the actual total number of cookies, I can give you the precise number of baggies. 

Please note that without knowing the specific numbers of chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies, it's not possible to determine the exact number of baggies Maria can make.<|im_end|>",3,3.0,8.0

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of brownies per batch:**
   - Isabel has already baked 3 brownies.
   - She needs a total of 5 brownies.

2. **Calculate the number of batches required to reach 5 brownies:**
   - Since she already baked 3 brownies, we subtract those from the total needed (5):
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2 \text{ batches}
     \]

3. **Find out how many cups of flour are used in one batch:**
   - Each batch uses 5 cups of flour.

4. **Calculate the total amount of flour used across all batches:**
   - Multiply the number of batches by the amount of flour per batch:

<|im_start|>system
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of tickets Tom has:**
   - Tom bought 40 tickets at the State Fair.
   - He then used 28 tickets at the Dunkin Clown Booth.
   - The remaining tickets will be used for rides.

2. **Calculate the number of tickets left after buying and spending:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining tickets} = \text{Total tickets} - \text{Tickets spent}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Remaining tickets} = 40 - 28 = 12
   \]

3. **Determine how many rides Tom can go on given that each ride costs 4 tickets:**
   - Each ride costs 4 tickets.
   - We need to find out how many full rides Tom can afford with his remaining 12 tickets.
   - Divide the remaining tickets by the ticket cost per ride:
   \[
   \text{Number of rides} = \frac{\text{Remaining tickets}}{\text{Tickets per ride}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Number of rides} = \frac{12}{4} = 3

2. **Calculate the number of shelves needed if Roger can fit 3 books per shelf:**
   - Number of books left = 12
   - Books per shelf = 3
   
   Number of shelves required = (Number of books left) / (Books per shelf)
   
   Number of shelves required = 12 / 3 = 4 shelves.

Therefore, Roger will need 4 shelves to store all the remaining books. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 4 shelves.<|im_end|>",4,4.0,4.0

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of flowers Bianca initially picked.
Bianca picked a total of 39 tulips and 49 roses. To find the total number of flowers, we add these two quantities together:

\[ \text{Total flowers} = 39 \text{ tulips} + 49 \text{ roses} \]

Performing the addition:

\[ 39 + 49 = 88 \]

So, Bianca initially picked 88 flowers in total.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of flowers Bianca actually used.
According to the information provided, Bianca only used 81 flowers.

### Step 3: Determine the number of extra flowers Bianca picked beyond her initial picking.
To find out how many more flowers Bianca picked than she used, subtract the number of flowers she actually used from the total number of flowers she initially picked:

\[ \text{Extra flowers} = \text{Total flowers} - \text{Flowers used} \]
\[ \text{Extra flowers} = 88 - 81 \]

Performing the subtraction:

\[ 88 - 81 = 7 \]

Therefore, Bianca picked **7** extra flowers beyond what she initially picked.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total time spent on each piece of furniture:**
   - Each piece of furniture (chairs or tables) takes 8 minutes.

2. **Determine the number of pieces of furniture:**
   - Emily bought 4 chairs.
   - Emily also bought 2 tables.
   
3. **Calculate the total time spent on all the chairs:**
   - Time spent on chairs = Number of chairs × Time per chair
   - Time spent on chairs = 4 chairs × 8 minutes/chair = 32 minutes

4. **Calculate the total time spent on all the tables:**
   - Time spent on tables = Number of tables × Time per table
   - Time spent on tables = 2 tables × 8 minutes/table = 16 minutes

5. **Add up the total time spent on both chairs and tables:**
   - Total time spent = Time spent on chairs + Time spent on tables
   - Total time spent = 32 minutes + 16 minutes = 48 minutes

Therefore, it took Emily 48 minutes in total to finish assembling everything.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total number of problems:**
   - Paige has 43 math problems.
   - She also has some unknown number of science problems.

2. **Calculate the total number of problems:**
   Since we know that after completing her work, she still has problems left to do, we can set up an equation where \( P \) represents the total number of problems.

\[ P = 43 + X \]
where \( X \) is the number of science problems.

3. **Determine the number of problems completed:**
   We know she completed 44 problems in school.

\[ 44 = 43 + Y \]

Here, \( Y \) represents the number of math problems she completed.

4. **Solve for \( Y \):**
   From the equation above,
   \[ Y = 44 - 43 \]
   \[ Y = 1 \]

So, Paige completed 1 math problem.

5. **Calculate the remaining problems:**
   Now, if she started with 43 math problems and completed 1 more,
   \[ Remaining\ Math\ Problems = 43 - 1 \]
   \[ Remaining\ Math\ Problems = 42 \]

6. **Subtract the math problems from the total:**
   Since the total number of problems (including both math and science) must equal the number she actually worked on plus the ones left to do,
   \[ Total\ Problems = 42 + X \]
   Where \( X \) is the number of science problems.

7. **Calculate the remaining science problems:**
   Since she has 12 science problems left to do,
   \[ Remaining\ Science\ Problems = 12 \]

8. **Verify the total number of problems:**
   The sum of the remaining math and science problems should equal the total number of problems.

Let's verify:
\[ 42 + 12 = 54 \]

This means Paige initially had 54 problems.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of cookies:**
   - Robin has 23 chocolate chip cookies.
   - She also has 25 oatmeal cookies.
   - Total number of cookies = Chocolate chip cookies + Oatmeal cookies
     \[
     \text{Total cookies} = 23 + 25 = 48
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of baggies based on the cookie count per baggie:**
   - Each baggie contains 6 cookies.
   - To find out how many baggies can be made from 48 cookies, divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per baggie.
     \[
     \text{Number of baggies} = \frac{\text{Total cookies}}{\text{Cookies per baggie}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of baggies} = \frac{48}{6} = 8

Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

1. **Determine total trays Jerry needs to pick up:**
   - From one table: 9 trays.
   - From another table: 7 trays.
   
2. **Calculate total number of trays:**
   \[

                    question:
                     A ; worksheet had 4 problems on it. If a teacher had 16 worksheets to grade and had already graded 8 of them, how many more problems does she have to grade? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of problems on all worksheets.
- There are 4 problems on one worksheet.
- The teacher has 16 worksheets.

Total number of problems = Number of problems per worksheet × Total number of worksheets
= 4 × 16
= 64 problems in total.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of problems that have been graded so far.
- The teacher has already graded 8 worksheets.

Number of problems graded = Number of problems per worksheet × Number of graded worksheets
= 4 × 8
= 32 problems.

### Step 3: Find out how many more problems need to be graded.
- We subtract the number of graded problems from the total number of problems.

Number of remaining problems to be graded = Total number of problems - Number of graded problems
= 64 - 32
= 32 problems.

Therefore, the teacher still needs to grade 32 more problems.

{The final answer is} 32<|im_end|>",32,32.0,32.0

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of scarfs in one box**:
   - Each box contains 5 scarfs.

2. **Calculate the total number of scarfs in all boxes**:
   - There are 6 boxes.
   - Therefore, the total number of scarfs = \(6 \times 5\).

3. **Determine the number of mittens in one box**:
   - Each box contains 5 mittens.

4. **Calculate the total number of mittens in all boxes**:
   - There are 6 boxes.
   - Therefore, the total number of mittens = \(6 \times 5\).

5. **Sum the total number of scarfs and mittens to find the total number of pieces of winter clothing**:
   - Total number of scarfs: \(6 \times 5\).
   - Total number of mittens: \(6 \times 5\).
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of winter clothing = (total number of scarfs) + (total number of mittens).

Let's perform the calculations:

- Total number of scarfs: \(6 \times 5 = 30\)
- Total number of mittens: \(6 \times 5 = 30\)

Now, summing up the total number of scarfs and mittens:

\[ \text{Total pieces of winter clothing} = 30 (\text{scarfs}) + 30 (\text{mittens}) = 60 \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}. 60 pieces of winter clothing.<|im_end|>",60,60.0,60.0

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time it will take for the chef to cook the remaining potatoes. Let's break down the process step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of potatoes left to be cooked.
- The total number of potatoes is 12.
- The chef has already cooked 6 potatoes.
- Therefore, the number of potatoes left to be cooked is \(12 - 6 = 6\).

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken per potato.
- Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.

### Step 3: Calculate the total time required to cook all potatoes.
- Since there are 6 potatoes left to be cooked, and each potato takes 6 minutes to cook,
\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \times 6 \text{ minutes} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take the chef to cook the remaining 6 potatoes is **36 minutes**.

This concludes our solution. The final answer is:

Let's break down this problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of games initially:**
   Luke started with 57 games.

2. **Determine how many games were not sold:**
   He sold 39 games.
   Therefore, the number of games left (that weren't sold) is:
   \[
   57 - 39 = 18
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of boxes needed for the remaining games:**
   Each box contains 2 games.
   
4. **Divide the remaining games by the number of games per box to find the number of boxes required:**

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

1. **Identify the cost per item:**
   - Each flower (whether a rose or a daisy) costs $3.

2. **Calculate the total number of flowers Emily bought:**
   - Emily bought 2 roses.
   - Emily also bought 2 daisies.
   - Therefore, the total number of flowers she bought is \(2 + 2 = 4\).

3. **Calculate the total cost based on the number of flowers and their individual price:**
   - Since each flower costs $3, the total cost for 4 flowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) dollars.

So, Emily spent $12 in total.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Total number of puppies**: The question states that there were 13 puppies.

2. **Puppies sold**: The store sold 7 puppies during one day.

3. **Remaining puppies**: To find out how many puppies are left after selling, we subtract the number sold from the total number:
   \[
   13 - 7 = 6
   \]
   So, there are 6 puppies remaining.

4. **Number of cages needed**: Each cage holds 2 puppies.
   
5. **Calculating the number of cages**: We divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage to determine how many cages are needed:
   \[

- Her mom picked 5 carrots.

Total number of carrots = Faye's carrots + Mom's carrots
= 23 + 5
= 28 carrots

**Step 2: Determine the number of good carrots**
- Only 12 of the carrots are considered good.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of bad carrots**
- We subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots to find the number of bad carrots.

Number of bad carrots = Total number of carrots - Number of good carrots

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of flowers Isabel has.
2. Calculate how many flowers wilted before the wedding.
3. Find out how many flowers are left after some wilted.
4. Divide the remaining flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet to find out how many bouquets she can make.

Let's go through each step:

### Step 1: Total Number of Flowers
Isabel picked 66 flowers for the wedding.

### Step 2: Flowers Wilted Before the Wedding
We know that 10% of the flowers wilted before the wedding. 

\[ \text{Number of flowers wilted} = 10\% \times 66 \]

Calculate \(10\%\) of 66:

\[ 0.10 \times 66 = 6.6 \]

Since you can't have a fraction of a flower, round down (assuming any fractional part would be considered as whole flowers):

\[ \text{Flowers wilted} = 6 \]

### Step 3: Remaining Flowers After Some Wilted
Subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers:

\[ \text{Remaining flowers} = 66 - 6 = 60 \]

### Step 4: Bouquets Isabel Can Make
Each bouquet contains 8 flowers. So, divide the remaining flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet:

\[ \text{Bouquets made} = \frac{\text{Remaining flowers}}{8} = \frac{60}{8} \]

Perform the division:

\[ \frac{60}{8} = 7.5 \]

Since Isabel can only make complete bouquets, we take the integer part of the result:

\[ \text{Bouquets made} = 7 \]

Therefore, Isabel could still make **7** bouquets.<|im_end|>",7,7.0,7.0

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rides:**
   - Ferris wheel: 5 times
   - Bumper cars: 4 times
   
   Total rides = Ferris wheel rides + Bumper car rides
                = 5 + 4
                = 9 rides

2. **Determine the cost per ride:**
   Each ride costs 7 tickets.

3. **Calculate the total number of tickets used:**
   Since there are 9 rides in total and each ride costs 7 tickets,
   
   Total tickets used = Number of rides × Cost per ticket
                       = 9 × 7

   - Wendy bought 4 new tables.
   - Total number of pieces = 4 (chairs) + 4 (tables) = 8 pieces.

2. **Calculate the total time spent on all the pieces:**
   - Each piece was put together in 6 minutes.
   - Total time = 8 pieces × 6 minutes per piece = 48 minutes.

3. **Divide the total time by the number of pieces to find out how long it took her to finish:**
   - Number of pieces = 8
   - Time taken per piece = 6 minutes
   - Time taken to finish = Total time ÷ Number of pieces = 48 minutes ÷ 8 pieces = 6 minutes.

Therefore, it took Wendy 6 minutes to finish assembling everything.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of customers before adding any more.
- The initial number of customers to be waited on was 39.

### Step 2: Add the additional customers during the lunch rush.
- The waiter added an additional 12 customers.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of customers after adding more.
\[ \text{Total customers} = 39 + 12 = 51 \]

### Step 4: Determine the number of customers who left without leaving a tip.
- According to the information given, 49 customers didn't leave a tip.

### Step 5: Calculate the number of customers who did leave a tip.
Since all the customers (both those who left tips and those who didn't) make up the total number of customers, we can find the number of customers who left a tip by subtracting the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers.

\[ \text{Customers who left a tip} = \text{Total customers} - \text{Customers who didn't leave a tip} \]
\[ \text{Customers who left a tip} = 51 - 49 = 2 \]

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Count**:
   - The cafeteria starts with 50 apples.

2. **Distribution for Lunch**:
   - They hand out 5 apples to students.
   
3. **Remaining Apples After Distribution**:
   - After distributing 5 apples to students, the remaining number of apples = 50 - 5 = 45 apples.

4. **Decide on Using Remaining Apples**:
   - They decide to use the remaining 45 apples to make pies.

5. **Number of Pies per Pie**:
   - Each pie requires 5 apples.

6. **Calculate Number of Pies**:
   - To find out how many pies can be made from 45 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples required per pie: 
     \[
     \text{Number of Pies} = \frac{45}{5} = 9
     \]

Therefore, they can make 9 pies using the remaining apples.

The final answer is: The final answer is The cafeteria can make 9 pies.<|im_end|>",9,9.0,9.0

1. **Identify the cost per deck**: The cost per deck is $7.
2. **Determine how many decks Frank bought**: Frank bought 3 decks.

   \text{Total amount Frank's friend spent} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]
6. **Add the amounts together to find the total spent**: To find the total amount spent on both decks, we add what Frank spent and what his friend spent.
