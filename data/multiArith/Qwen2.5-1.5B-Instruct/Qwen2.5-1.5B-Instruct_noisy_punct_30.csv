To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial number of songs**: Paige initially has 11 songs.
2. **Songs removed**: Paige deletes 9 old songs from her MP3 player.
   - Calculation: \(11 - 9 = 2\)
   - After deleting the songs, Paige has 2 songs left.

3. **New songs added**: Paige adds 8 new songs to her MP3 player.
   - Calculation: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
   - After adding the new songs, Paige has 10 songs in total.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    question:
                     There were : 39 girls and 4 : boys trying out for : the schools basketball team. If only 26 ; of them got called back, : how many students didn't make the cut? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of students who tried out:**
   - We know there are 39 girls.
   - The ratio of boys to girls is given as 4:1.
   - Let's denote the number of boys as \( B \).
   - According to the ratio, \( B = 4 \times 39 \) (since 39 girls correspond to 1 part in the ratio).

2. **Calculate the total number of boys:**
   - Since \( B = 4 \times 39 \), we calculate:
     \[
     B = 156
     \]

3. **Find the total number of students who tried out:**
   - Total students = Number of girls + Number of boys
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Total students} = 39 \text{ (girls)} + 156 \text{ (boys)} = 195
     \]

4. **Determine the number of students who got called back:**
   - Only 26 students got called back.

5. **Calculate the number of students who did not get called back:**
   - Subtract the number of students called back from the total number of students:
     \[
     \text{Students who did not get called back} = 195 - 26
     \]
     \[
     \text{Students who did not get called back} = 169
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is}: 169 students did not make it onto the team.<|im_end|>",17

   - Faye initially has 34 coloring books.

2. **Books given away:**
   - She gives away 3 books.
     \[
     34 - 3 = 31
     \]
   So, after giving away 3 books, she has 31 books left.

3. **Books purchased:**
   - Then, she buys 48 more books.
     \[
     31 + 48 = 79

2. **Apples used for lunch**: They use 20 apples to make lunch.

   - Subtracting these from the initial amount: \(23 - 20 = 3\)

3. **Remaining apples after using some for lunch**:
   
   - After using 20 apples, there are 3 apples left in the cafeteria.

4. **Additional apples bought**: They buy an additional 6 apples.

   - Adding these to the remaining apples: \(3 + 6 = 9\)

5. **Final number of apples**: After all transactions, they will have 9 apples.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Megan had 14 bags to recycle.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of bags that were not recycled.
She did not recycle 5 bags.

### Step 3: Subtract the non-recycled bags from the total bags to find out how many were actually recycled.
Total bags - Non-recycled bags = Recycled bags
14 bags - 5 bags = 9 bags

### Step 4: Multiply the number of recycled bags by the points per bag to determine the total points.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of roses sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings from selling those roses.

Step 1: Determine the total number of roses sold.
April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left after the sale. Therefore, the number of roses sold is:
\[ \text{Roses sold} = \text{Total roses} - \text{Roses left} \]
\[ \text{Roses sold} = 13 - 4 = 9 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings from selling those roses.
Each rose costs $4, so the total earnings can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of roses sold} \times \text{Price per rose} \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 9 \times 4 = 36 \]

Therefore, the amount of money April earned is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many shirts Ned did not wash given that he initially had 30 shirts in total (9 short sleeves + 21 long sleeves) but finished washing only 29 shirts.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of shirts Ned has:**
   \[
   \text{Total shirts} = 9 (\text{short sleeves}) + 21 (\text{long sleeves})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total shirts} = 9 + 21 = 30
   \]

2. **Determine how many shirts Ned did not wash:**
   Since Ned finished washing 29 shirts out of his 30 total shirts, the number of shirts he did not wash is:
   \[
   \text{Shirts not washed} = \text{Total shirts} - \text{Shirts washed}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Shirts not washed} = 30 - 29 = 1

                     Tom had 5 , books. If ! he sold 4 of them and used ! the , money he earned to buy 38 new : books, how many books would Tom ! have? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of books**: Tom starts with 5 books.
2. **Books sold**: Tom sells 4 books.
   - Calculation: \( 5 - 4 = 1 \) book left.

Now we need to account for the money earned from selling these books.

3. **Money earned**: The amount of money Tom earns from selling 4 books can be calculated as follows (assuming a price per book):
   - Let's denote the price per book as \( p \).
   - Therefore, the total money earned is \( 4p \).

Next, Tom uses this money to buy new books.

4. **Number of new books bought**: Tom buys 38 new books with the money earned.
   - Calculation: Since he buys 38 new books with the money he earned, his total earnings should cover or exceed this purchase.

We know that Tom initially had no money before selling any books, so all the money he gets must go towards buying books. 

5. **Equating earnings to new books purchased**:
   - We know that after selling 4 books, he has 1 book left.
   - He then spends $4 on new books, meaning the total money spent on new books equals his initial earnings.
   - Thus, if he buys 38 new books with the same money, we can calculate how much he originally had.

Let's find out how much he originally had in terms of books:

6. **Calculate original money needed to buy 38 books**:
   - Let's assume the price per book is $1 for simplicity.
   - So, the cost of 38 books would be \( 38 \times 1 = 38 \) dollars.

Since he ends up having 1 book after selling 4 books, and he buys 38 books using those funds, his original earning must equal the difference between what he spent and what he started with.

7. **Original money calculation**:
   - If he ends up with 1 book after spending $4, then his initial money was:
     \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) dollars.

So, Tom had 5 books at first, and now he has 1 book plus the 38 books he bought with the remaining money. 

8. **Final number of books**:
   - Total books = Books he has now + Books he bought with his earnings
   - Total books = 1 + 38 = 39 books.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 39 books.<|im_end|>",39

To determine how many shelves Jerry's fridge will be filled up to, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of sodas:**
   - Regular sodas: 41
   - Diet sodas: 22
   - Total sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
   \[
   \text{Total sodas} = 41 + 22 = 63
   \]

2. **Determine how many sodas fit on one shelf:**
   - Fridge can hold: 9 sodas per shelf

3. **Divide the total number of sodas by the capacity of one shelf:**
   \[
   \frac{\text{Total sodas}}{\text{Sodas per shelf}} = \frac{63}{9}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{63}{9} = 7

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many small gardens Emily has based on the information provided.

Step 1: Determine the total number of seeds Emily started with.
Emily started with 41 seeds.

Step 2: Calculate the number of seeds she planted in the big garden.
She planted 29 seeds in the big garden.

Step 3: Subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds to find out how many seeds she had left for the small gardens.
Total seeds - Seeds in big garden = Seeds for small gardens
41 seeds - 29 seeds = 12 seeds

Step 4: Determine how many seeds were used per small garden.
Emily puts 4 seeds in each small garden.

Step 5: Divide the number of seeds left for small gardens by the number of seeds per small garden to find out how many small gardens Emily has.
Seeds for small gardens / Seeds per small garden = Number of small gardens
12 seeds ÷ 4 seeds/garden = 3 gardens

Therefore, Emily has 3 small gardens.

The final answer is: The final answer is 3.<|im_end|>",3

   - From her older sister: 13 pieces
   - Total = 5 + 13 = 18 pieces

2. **Determine how many pieces Emily eats per day:**
   - Emily eats 9 pieces per day.

3. **Calculate the number of days the candies will last:**
   - Number of days = Total number of candies / Pieces eaten per day
   - Number of days = 18 / 9 = 2 days

4. **Verify the calculation:**
   - If Emily eats 9 pieces per day for 2 days, she will eat \( 9 \times 2 = 18 \) pieces.
   - This matches the total number of candies she has.

Therefore, the candies will last Emily 2 days.

{The final answer is} The candies will last Emily 2 days.<|im_end|>",2

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pictures taken during the trip.
2. Subtract the number of pictures deleted from the total number of pictures taken.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Total number of pictures taken = Pictures at the zoo + Pictures at the museum
   = 49 (zoo) + 8 (museum)
   = 57 pictures

Now for step 2:

2. Number of pictures left after deletion = Total number of pictures - Number of pictures deleted

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Determine the number of customers who tipped.
2. Calculate the total amount earned from tips.

Step 1: Determine the number of customers who tipped.
We know that out of the 7 customers, only some did not leave a tip. The rest left a tip. We can calculate the number of customers who tipped as follows:
\[ \text{Number of customers who tipped} = 7 - \text{Number of customers who didn't tip} \]
Since we don't have the exact number of customers who didn't tip yet, we'll represent this unknown quantity as \( x \). So,
\[ \text{Number of customers who tipped} = 7 - x \]

Step 2: Calculate the total amount earned from tips.
Each customer who tipped gave $3, so the total amount earned from tips would be:
\[ \text{Total amount earned} = (\text{Number of customers who tipped}) \times (3) \]
Substituting the expression for the number of customers who tipped, we get:
\[ \text{Total amount earned} = (7 - x) \times 3 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{Total amount earned}}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost for the group based on their meal type (adult or kid). Let's break down the solution into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of adults in the group.
Given that there are 13 people in total and 9 of them are kids, we can calculate the number of adults as follows:
\[ \text{Number of adults} = \text{Total number of people} - \text{Number of kids} \]
\[ \text{Number of adults} = 13 - 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of adults} = 4 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for one adult meal.
Each adult meal costs $7.

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for all adult meals.
Since there are 4 adults and each adult meal costs $7, the total cost for the adults is:
\[ \text{Total cost for adults} = \text{Number of adults} \times \text{Cost per adult meal} \]
\[ \text{Total cost for adults} = 4 \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for adults} = 28 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost for all kid meals.
Kids eat for free, so no additional cost needs to be considered for the kids' meals.

### Final Calculation:
Now, add up the costs from both adults and kids to get the total amount the group will spend at the restaurant:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for adults} + \text{Total cost for kids} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 28 + 0 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 28 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of bears.
Initially, the toy store had 17 giant stuffed bears in stock.

When they received another shipment, they added 10 more bears to their inventory.

So, the total number of bears after receiving the shipment is:
\[ 17 + 10 = 27 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many bears can fit on one shelf.
Each shelf holds 9 bears.

To find out how many shelves are needed for all the bears, we divide the total number of bears by the capacity per shelf:
\[ \frac{27}{9} = 3 \]

### Conclusion:
They used **3 shelves** to store all the bears.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

                    question:
                     Gwen : was organizing ! her book case making sure each : of , the ? shelves had exactly ; 4 books on it. If . she had 5 shelves of mystery books and 3 ; shelves of picture . books, how ; many books did she have total? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of books based on the information provided about the different types of shelves.

1. **Determine the number of mystery books:**
   - Gwen has 5 shelves dedicated to mystery books.
   - Each shelf contains exactly 4 books.
   - Therefore, the total number of mystery books is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total Mystery Books} = 5 \times 4 = 20
     \]

2. **Determine the number of picture books:**
   - Gwen also has 3 shelves dedicated to picture books.
   - Each shelf contains exactly 4 books.
   - Therefore, the total number of picture books is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total Picture Books} = 3 \times 4 = 12
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of books:**
   - Add the total number of mystery books and the total number of picture books together.
   - Thus, the total number of books is:
     \[
     \text{Total Books} = \text{Total Mystery Books} + \text{Total Picture Books}
     \]
     Substituting the values from steps 1 and 2:
     \[
     \text{Total Books} = 20 + 12 = 32
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of pictures**: Wendy has uploaded 79 pictures to Facebook.

2. **Subtract the number of pictures in the single album**: Wendy put 44 pictures into one album. So, we subtract 44 from the total number of pictures.
   \[
   79 - 44 = 35
   \]

3. **Divide the remaining pictures among 5 different albums**: The remaining 35 pictures will be divided equally into 5 different albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide 35 by 5.
   \[
   35 \div 5 = 7
   \]

Therefore, there are 7 pictures in each of the 5 different albums.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{7}\)<|im_end|>",7

To determine how many groups of 9 can be made from the total number of participants in the debate competition, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   - There are 5 boys.
   - There are 40 girls.

   Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 5 + 40 = 45
   \]

2. **Determine how many groups of 9 can be formed:**
   To find out how many groups of 9 can be made from 45 students, divide the total number of students by the group size (9).
   
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Group size}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{45}{9} = 5

   - She has 4 roses left.

2. **Calculate the number of roses sold:**
   - Subtract the remaining roses from the initial roses to find out how many were sold.
     \[
     \text{Number of roses sold} = 9 - 4 = 5
     \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings from selling these roses:**
   - Each rose was sold for $7.
   - Multiply the number of roses sold by the price per rose to find the total earnings.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of cats initially at the pet store.**
- The pet store has 13 Siamese cats.
- The pet store also has 5 other types of cats (house cats).

So, we add these together to find the initial total number of cats:
\[ 13 \text{ (Siamese)} + 5 \text{ (other types)} = 18 \text{ cats} \]

**Step 2: Subtract the number of cats sold from the initial total.**
- The pet store sold 10 cats during the sale.

Subtracting the sold cats from the initial total gives us:
\[ 18 \text{ (initial total)} - 10 \text{ (sold)} = 8 \text{ cats remaining} \]

Therefore, after selling 10 cats, the pet store has **8 cats** left in stock.<|im_end|>",8

   - Victor earns $6 per hour.

2. **Calculate his earnings for Monday**:
   - Victor worked 5 hours.
   - Earnings = Hourly wage × Hours worked
   - Earnings (Monday) = $6/hour × 5 hours = $30

3. **Calculate his earnings for Tuesday**:
   - Victor worked another 5 hours.
   - Earnings = Hourly wage × Hours worked
   - Earnings (Tuesday) = $6/hour × 5 hours = $30

4. **Sum up his total earnings over the two days**:
   - Total earnings = Earnings from Monday + Earnings from Tuesday

Megan baked 71 cupcakes.

### Step 2: Subtract the number of cupcakes eaten by Todd from the total number of cupcakes.
Todd ate 43 cupcakes, so we subtract that from the total number of cupcakes:
\[ 71 - 43 = 28 \]

So, after Todd eats some cupcakes, there are 28 cupcakes left.

### Step 3: Calculate how many packages can be made with the remaining cupcakes.
Each package contains 7 cupcakes, so we divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per package:
\[ 28 \div 7 = 4 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers used to make bouquets**
- Wendy picked 103 flowers.
- Each bouquet contains 8 flowers.

First, we need to determine how many full bouquets can be made from these flowers.

\[ \text{Number of bouquets} = \frac{\text{Total flowers}}{\text{Flowers per bouquet}} \]

Substitute the given numbers:

\[ \text{Number of bouquets} = \frac{103}{8} \]

Perform the division:

\[ \text{Number of bouquets} = 12.875 \]

Since Wendy cannot create a fraction of a bouquet, she can only make whole bouquets.

So far, we have calculated that Wendy can make 12 full bouquets.

**Step 2: Determine if any flowers were left after some wilted**

- We know that 47 flowers wilted before the wedding.

Therefore, the number of flowers remaining after the wilted ones is:

\[ \text{Remaining flowers} = \text{Total flowers} - \text{Wilted flowers} \]
\[ \text{Remaining flowers} = 103 - 47 \]
\[ \text{Remaining flowers} = 56 \]

**Step 3: Check if there are enough flowers to make another bouquet**

Now, we check if Wendy has enough flowers to make an additional bouquet:

- The first 8 flowers will not be used because they are already accounted for as being wilted.
- Subtracting the 8 flowers that are used from the remaining flowers:

\[ \text{Available flowers for new bouquet} = \text{Remaining flowers} - 8 \]
\[ \text{Available flowers for new bouquet} = 56 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Available flowers for new bouquet} = 48 \]

Since 48 flowers are available for making a new bouquet, Wendy can indeed make one more bouquet.

**Conclusion:**
Wendy can still make **one more bouquet** using the remaining 48 flowers.<|im_end|>",7

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many books Adam has after selling some and buying more, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of books Adam sells.
Adam initially has 48 books. He sells 19 books.

\[ \text{Books remaining} = 48 - 19 \]

\[ \text{Books remaining} = 29 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Adam earns from selling his books.
Since the value or price per book isn't provided, let's assume that Adam sells all his books at the same price for simplicity (though in real scenarios this information might be crucial).

Let \( p \) represent the price per book. Therefore,

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 19p \]

However, without knowing the exact price per book, we can't calculate an exact monetary value here.

### Step 3: Use the earnings to buy new books.
After selling his books, Adam uses the money to buy 38 new books.

We'll use the total earnings calculated in Step 2 as the total cost of the new books.

If we were to proceed with the assumption that Adam sells his books for $1 each (a common scenario), then the total earnings would be:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 19 \times 1 = \$19 \]

Using this $19, Adam buys 38 new books.

\[ \text{Cost of 38 new books} = 38p \]

Since we don't know \( p \), we cannot accurately determine the total cost. However, if we hypothetically set \( p = 1 \):

\[ \text{Cost of 38 new books} = 38 \]

So, if Adam buys 38 books for $38, he will have:

\[ \text{Remaining books} = 0 + 38 \]

Therefore, assuming no other expenses or losses, Adam ends up with 38 new books.

### Conclusion:
Given the assumptions made about the price per book ($1), Adam would end up having **38** books after selling 19 books and using the proceeds to buy 38 new books. 

\[
\boxed{\text{38}}

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of apples:**
   - The school cafeteria starts with 38 apples.

2. **Apples used for lunch:**
   - They use 20 apples to make lunch for the students.
     Calculation: \( 38 - 20 = 18 \)
   - After using these apples, there are 18 apples left.

3. **Additional apples bought:**
   - They buy 28 more apples.
     Calculation: \( 18 + 28 = 46 \)

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of apples used for making pies:**
   - Initially, there were 96 apples.
   - 42 apples were given to students.
   - Subtract the number of apples given to students from the total number of apples:
     \[
     96 - 42 = 54 \text{ apples}

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

1. Determine the number of missing pieces needed to complete the collection.
2. Calculate the cost per piece.
3. Multiply the number of missing pieces by the cost per piece to find the total amount of money needed.

Let's go through these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of missing pieces needed to complete the collection
Henry needs a total of 8 pieces to complete his collection. He already has 3 pieces. So, the number of missing pieces is:
\[ \text{Number of missing pieces} = 8 - 3 = 5 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost per piece
Each piece costs $6. Therefore, the cost for each missing piece is:
\[ \text{Cost per piece} = \$6 \]

### Step 3: Multiply the number of missing pieces by the cost per piece
Now, multiply the number of missing pieces (which is 5) by the cost per piece ($6):
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 \times \$6 = \$30 \]

So, the total amount of money Henry would need to finish his collection is:

To determine how many more cups of flour Tiffany needs to bake all the brownies, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of brownies Tiffany plans to bake:**
   - Tiffany wants to bake 8 brownies.

2. **Determine how many brownies she has already baked:**
   - She has already baked 8 brownies.

3. **Find out how many more brownies she needs to bake:**
   - Total brownies planned = 8
   - Brownies already baked = 8
   - Additional brownies needed = 8 (planned) - 8 (already baked) = 0

4. **Assume that the amount of flour required per brownie remains constant:**
   - Each brownie requires 8 cups of flour.

5. **Calculate the total amount of flour needed for all brownies:**
   - Since there are no additional brownies to be baked, the total amount of flour needed is equal to the flour already used.
   - Flour already used = 8 cups/brownie * 8 brownies = 64 cups

Since Tiffany only needs to bake 8 brownies in total, she will use exactly 64 cups of flour. Therefore, she does not need any more flour because she has already calculated her requirements based on the initial plan.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of books Roger has left after selling some**

Roger initially had 25 books.

He sold 21 books.
\[ 25 - 21 = 4 \]

So, Roger now has 4 books remaining.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Roger earned from selling his books**

Each book is worth $1 (assuming the value of each book is $1 for simplicity).
\[ 21 \text{ books} \times \$1 \text{ per book} = \$21 \]

So, Roger earned $21 from selling his books.

**Step 3: Determine how much money Roger spent on buying new books**

Roger spent all the money he earned from selling his books, which was $21.
\[ \$21 \text{ spent on new books} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of books Roger bought after spending money on new ones**

Roger originally had 4 books. He bought 30 more books with the money he saved.
\[ 4 + 30 = 34 \]

So, Roger ended up having 34 books in total.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{34}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of students who got picked.
We know that there are 65 students in total and 17 did not get picked. Therefore, we subtract these numbers to find out how many students got picked.

\[ \text{Number of students picked} = \text{Total students} - \text{Students not picked} \]

\[ \text{Number of students picked} = 65 - 17 \]

\[ \text{Number of students picked} = 48 \]

### Step 2: Divide the number of students picked equally among the groups.
Now, we need to divide these 48 students into 8 equal groups.

\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{\text{Number of students picked}}{\text{Number of groups}} \]

\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{48}{8} \]

\[ \text{Number of students per group} = 6 \]

2. **Pictures placed in one album**: According to the information provided, she placed 10 pictures in one album.

3. **Remaining pictures**: To find out how many pictures are left after placing some in the first album, we subtract the 10 pictures from the total 25 pictures.
   \[
   25 - 10 = 15
   \]

4. **Number of remaining albums**: The remaining pictures will be divided among five different albums.

5. **Pics per album**: Now, we divide the remaining 15 pictures equally among the five albums.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of puppies:**
   - The shelter initially has 2 puppies.
   - Another 34 puppies are brought in.
   
   Total number of puppies = Initial puppies + Additional puppies
                           = 2 + 34
                           = 36 puppies
   
2. **Calculate the number of days required to adopt all the puppies:**
   - Each day, 4 puppies are adopted.
   - We need to find out how many days it will take until there are no puppies left.

Let's denote the number of days as \( d \).

- After \( d \) days, the total number of adopted puppies would be \( 4d \).
- All puppies should eventually be adopted, so after \( d \) days, we have \( 0 \) puppies remaining.

We can set up an equation based on this information:
\[ 36 - 4d = 0 \]

Solving for \( d \):
\[ 36 = 4d \]
\[ d = \frac{36}{4} \]
\[ d = 9 \]

So, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{9}\).<|im_end|>",9

                    question:
                     ! April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was . 6 dollars. If Katie bought 5 roses ; and 5 daisies, how much ! did she spend? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the cost per item:**
   - Each flower (whether it's a rose or a daisy) costs $0.60.

2. **Calculate the total cost for roses:**
   - Katie bought 5 roses.
   - Cost of one rose = $0.60
   - Total cost for 5 roses = \( 5 \times 0.60 \)

\[
5 \times 0.60 = 3.00
\]

So, the total cost for 5 roses is $3.00.

3. **Calculate the total cost for daisies:**
   - Katie also bought 5 daisies.
   - Cost of one daisy = $0.60
   - Total cost for 5 daisies = \( 5 \times 0.60 \)

\[
5 \times 0.60 = 3.00
\]

So, the total cost for 5 daisies is $3.00.

4. **Add up the total costs:**
   - Cost for roses + Cost for daisies = $3.00 + $3.00

\[
3.00 + 3.00 = 6.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount Katie spent is $6.00.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{6}$.<|im_end|>",60

                    question:
                     At the schools ; book fair Victor bought 32 adventure ; books and 37 mystery . books. If 16 of the books ! were . used, how many new books : did he buy? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the number of new books Victor bought, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of books purchased.
Victor bought 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books.

\[
\text{Total books} = 32 \text{ (adventure)} + 37 \text{ (mystery)}
\]

Calculate this sum:

\[
\text{Total books} = 32 + 37 = 69
\]

So far, we have accounted for all 69 books that Victor bought.

### Step 2: Subtract the number of used books from the total number of books.
We know that 16 of the books were used.

\[
\text{New books} = \text{Total books} - \text{Used books}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{New books} = 69 - 16
\]

Perform the subtraction:

\[
\text{New books} = 53
\]

Therefore, Victor bought **53** new books.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many carrots Maria has after throwing some out**
- Maria initially picks 48 carrots.
- She throws out 11 carrots.

Let's subtract the number of thrown-out carrots from the initial count:

\[ 48 - 11 = 37 \]

So, after throwing out 11 carrots, Maria has 37 carrots left.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of carrots after picking more on the next day**
- After throwing out 11 carrots, Maria has 37 carrots remaining.
- On the next day, she picks up 15 more carrots.

We add the new carrots to what she had left:

\[ 37 + 15 = 52 \]

Therefore, after picking up 15 more carrots, Maria ends up with a total of **52 carrots**.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 52 carrots.<|im_end|>",52

<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of books**: Adam starts with 33 books.

2. **Books sold**: He sells 11 of his books.
   - After selling these, Adam has \( 33 - 11 = 22 \) books left.

3. **Money earned from selling books**: The $11 he earns from selling books goes towards buying new books.

4. **Number of new books bought**: With the $11, Adam buys 23 new books.
   - However, since the total amount of money ($11) only allows for the purchase of 23 books (which is more than what was initially planned), it seems there might be an inconsistency or misunderstanding in the context provided. Let's assume that the $11 was intended to cover part of the cost rather than being spent entirely on books.

5. **Remaining money after buying books**: Since he can't spend exactly $11 on 23 books without exceeding the initial $11, let's consider if the intention was to use some of the remaining money (if any).

6. **Final calculation**:
   - After selling 11 books, Adam has 22 books left.
   - With the remaining money, he could theoretically buy up to 10 more books because \( \frac{11}{1.1} \approx 10 \).
   - Therefore, he would add another 10 books to his collection.

So, the total number of books Adam would have at the end is \( 22 + 10 = 32 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 32 books.<|im_end|>",45

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate earnings for Monday:**
   - Will works for 8 hours.
   - He earns $8 per hour.

   \[
   \text{Earnings for Monday} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$8/\text{hour}
   \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount of waste recycled.
Gwen and her friends recycled a total of:
- Gwen: 5 pounds
- Friends: 13 pounds

Total = 5 + 13 = 18 pounds

### Step 2: Calculate the number of points based on the recycling weight.
For every 3 pounds recycled, they earn 1 point.

Since the total amount recycled is 18 pounds, we need to find out how many sets of 3 pounds fit into 18 pounds.

Number of sets = Total pounds / Pounds per set
Number of sets = 18 / 3 = 6

### Step 3: Determine the number of points earned.
Each set of 3 pounds gives them 1 point, so for 6 sets:
Points earned = Number of sets × Points per set
Points earned = 6 × 1 = 6

Therefore, the total number of points they earned is **6**.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The ratio for the pet store is \( 4 : \text{bird} : \text{cages} \).
   - Each cage contains 8 parrots and 2 parakeets.
   - We need to find the total number of birds (both types) in the pet store.

2. **Determine the number of cages:**
   - Let's assume there are \( x \) cages.

3. **Calculate the total number of parrots:**
   - Since each cage contains 8 parrots, the total number of parrots would be \( 8x \).

4. **Calculate the total number of parakeets:**
   - Since each cage contains 2 parakeets, the total number of parakeets would be \( 2x \).

5. **Add the total number of parrots and parakeets together:**
   - The total number of birds is the sum of the parrots and parakeets.
   - Therefore, the total number of birds is \( 8x + 2x = 10x \).

6. **Verify the ratio:**
   - According to the given ratio \( 4 : \text{bird} : \text{cages} \), we know that out of every 4 items, one item is a bird.
   - This means that the total number of birds should be \( 4 \times \text{number of cages} \).

7. **Relate the total number of birds to the number of cages:**
   - From step 6, we know the total number of birds is \( 10x \).
   - And from step 2, we know the number of cages is \( x \).
   - So, \( 10x = 4x \).

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the equation \( 10x = 4x \).
   - Subtract \( 4x \) from both sides: \( 6x = 0 \).
   - Divide both sides by 6: \( x = 0 \).

9. **Conclusion:**
   - Since \( x = 0 \), it implies that the number of cages is zero.
   - However, if the number of cages is zero, then there cannot be any parrots or parakeets since each cage contains at least one bird.
   - Therefore, the total number of birds must also be zero because there are no cages.

Each box contains 6 pieces of candy.
Therefore, for 14 boxes, the total number of pieces is \( 14 \times 6 = 84 \).

**Step 3: Subtract the number of pieces given to his brother from the total number of pieces.**
Kaleb gave 5 pieces to his brother.

                    question:
                     Maria was making baggies of cookies ! with 8 cookies in each bag. . If she had 5 chocolate chip cookies . and . 19 : oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how many baggies of cookies Maria can make, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of cookies Maria has.
Maria has two types of cookies: chocolate chip and oatmeal.

- Chocolate chip cookies: 5
- Oatmeal cookies: 19

Total number of cookies = Number of chocolate chip cookies + Number of oatmeal cookies
= 5 + 19
= 24 cookies

### Step 2: Determine how many cookies fit into one baggie.
Each baggie contains 8 cookies.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of baggies based on the total number of cookies.
Number of baggies = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies per baggie
= 24 / 8
= 3

Therefore, Maria can make **3** baggies of cookies.<|im_end|>",3

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the cost per item:**
   - Each flower (including roses and daisies) costs $3.

2. **Calculate the total number of items Zoe purchased:**
   - Zoe bought 8 roses.
   - Zoe also bought 2 daisies.

3. **Sum up the total number of items:**
   - Roses + Daisies = Total Items

4. **Multiply the total number of items by the cost per item:**

Let's go through these steps in detail:

1. **Cost per item:**  
   - Each item (rose or daisy) costs $3.

2. **Total number of items:**
   - Number of roses = 8
   - Number of daisies = 2

   Therefore,
   \[
   \text{Total Items} = 8 (\text{roses}) + 2 (\text{daisies}) = 10 \text{ items}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost per item = $3
   - Total Items = 10

   So,
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 3 = \$30
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Zoe spent is $\boxed{30}$ dollars.<|im_end|>",30

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Initial number of students
At the beginning of the year (start), there were 31 students.

### Step 2: Calculate the change due to student departures
During the year, 5 students left.
- Number of students who left = 5

### Step 3: Calculate the change due to new students
During the year, 11 new students joined.
- Number of new students who joined = 11

### Step 4: Calculate the net change in the number of students
Net change = Students who left - New students who joined
= 5 - 11 = -6

This means that the total number of students decreased by 6 during the year.

### Step 5: Calculate the final number of students
Final number of students = Initial number + Net change

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     A waiter had ; 22 ; customers in his section. If 14 of them ; left and the ; rest of his tables had 4 people at each : table, how many tables did ? he ! have? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of customers**: The waiter starts with 22 customers.

2. **Customers who left**: Out of these 22 customers, 14 left. So, we subtract those from the total:
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
   This means there are now 8 customers remaining.

3. **Number of customers per table after some leave**: After the 14 customers leave, the remaining 8 customers fill up the available tables.
   
4. **Determine the number of tables**:
   Since each of the remaining 8 customers sits at one table and there were originally enough tables for 14 customers to sit (since 22 was divided equally), let's calculate the number of tables needed initially.
   
   Initially, if all 22 seats were filled when 14 were present, then:
   \[
   \text{Tables} = \frac{\text{Total seats}}{\text{Seats per customer}}
   \]
   But since only 14 customers sat, it implies that the number of tables was calculated based on 14 seats rather than 22.
   
5. **Calculate the initial number of tables**: Given that each table holds 4 people after some leave, we can find out how many tables fit into the 14 seats left over:
   \[
   \text{Tables} = \frac{14}{4}
   \]
   Simplifying this gives us:
   \[
   \text{Tables} = 3.5
   \]

6. **Adjusting for whole numbers**: Since the number of tables must be a whole number, and considering the initial setup where 22 seats were available and only 14 were occupied initially, we need to re-evaluate the setup correctly:
   \[
   \text{Tables} = \left\lceil \frac{22}{4} \right\rceil = 6
   \]
   Here, `ceil` function ensures we get the smallest integer greater than or equal to the division result.

7. **Verify the calculation**: We see that 6 tables would indeed hold exactly 20 seats (if each table accommodates 4 people):
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24
   \]
   However, since only 22 seats are available, and 14 are taken away, the correct number should be recalculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Final Tables} = \left\lfloor \frac{22}{4} \right\rfloor = 5
   \]
   Here, `floor` function ensures we don't exceed the available seats.

Therefore, the waiter initially set up 5 tables, which could accommodate 20 customers, leaving 2 seats unfilled. Then, after 14 customers left, the remaining 8 customers filled 2 more tables, making the total number of tables 7.

So, the waiter had **7 tables** in his section.<|im_end|>",2

                    question:
                     Roger had : 120 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 48 of them in one load, but decided , to split the rest into 9 equal loads. ! How many ? pieces of clothing could : go in each of the small loads? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many pieces of clothing can fit into each small load, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining number of clothes after putting 48 in one load:**
   Roger started with 120 pieces of clothing.
   \[
   120 - 48 = 72
   \]
   So, there are 72 pieces of clothing left.

2. **Divide the remaining clothes equally among 9 loads:**
   We need to divide 72 by 9 to find out how many pieces of clothing will be in each load.
   \[
   \frac{72}{9} = 8
   \]

Therefore, each small load will contain **8** pieces of clothing.<|im_end|>",8

To determine the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of students**: Start with the initial number of students at the beginning of the year.
   \[
   \text{Initial number} = 10
   \]

2. **Students leaving**: Subtract the number of students who left during the year from the total initially present.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after leaving} = 10 - 4
   \]
   
3. **New students arriving**: Add the number of new students that arrived during the year to the remaining number.
   \[
   \text{Final count} = (10 - 4) + 42

Roger starts with 14 books.

**Step 2: Calculate how many books the librarian takes**
The librarian takes 2 books from Roger.

**Step 3: Subtract the taken books from the initial count**
\[ 14 - 2 = 12 \]

So, Roger has 12 books left to put away.

**Step 4: Determine how many books fit on one shelf**

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of flowers Bianca initially picked:**
   - She picked 39 tulips.
   - She also picked 49 roses.
   
   Total flowers = Tulips + Roses
   Total flowers = 39 (tulips) + 49 (roses)
   Total flowers = 88 flowers

2. **Calculate the number of flowers Bianca actually used:**
   - She used 81 flowers.

3. **Find out how many flowers were not used:**
   Number of unused flowers = Total flowers - Flowers used
   
   Number of unused flowers = 88 (total flowers) - 81 (flowers used)
   Number of unused flowers = 7 flowers

Therefore, Bianca had 7 more flowers than she needed for her bouquet.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with after some students requested fruit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the total number of apples ordered:**
   - Red apples: 6
   - Green apples: 15
   - Total apples ordered = Red apples + Green apples
     \[
     \text{Total apples} = 6 + 15 = 21

2. **Determine the number of students who wanted fruit:**
   - Only 5 students wanted fruit.

3. **Calculate the number of apples used (which corresponds to the number of students):**
   - Since each student gets one apple, the number of apples used equals the number of students.
     \[
     \text{Apples used} = 5
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of extra apples remaining:**
   - Subtract the number of apples used from the total number of apples ordered.
     \[
     \text{Extra apples} = \text{Total apples} - \text{Apples used}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Extra apples} = 21 - 5 = 16

                    question:
                     Mike ? made 42 dollars ? mowing lawns over the summer. ; If he spent 10 ? dollars buying new mower blades, how many 8 dollar games could he buy with the money ; he ? had left? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total amount Mike has after spending on mower blades:**
   - Mike initially made $42.
   - He spent $10 on mower blades.

2. **Calculate the remaining amount:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = \$42 - \$10 = \$32
   \]

3. **Determine how much money one game costs:**
   - Each game costs $8.

4. **Calculate how many games Mike can afford based on his remaining amount:**
   - To find out how many games he can buy, divide the remaining amount by the cost per game.
   \[
   \text{Number of games} = \frac{\$32}{\$8}
   \]

5. **Perform the division to get the number of games:**
   \[
   \text{Number of games} = 4
   \]

So, Mike would be able to buy 4 games with the money he has left.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 4.<|im_end|>",4

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how long it will take the chef to cook the remaining potatoes, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of potatoes still needed.
The total number of potatoes required is 13. The chef has already cooked 5 potatoes.

\[
\text{Number of potatoes still needed} = \text{Total number of potatoes} - \text{Potatoes already cooked}
\]

Substitute the given values into the equation:

\[
\text{Number of potatoes still needed} = 13 - 5 = 8
\]

So, there are 8 potatoes left to be cooked.

### Step 2: Calculate the time needed to cook the remaining potatoes.
Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook. Therefore, for 8 potatoes, the total cooking time would be:

\[
\text{Total cooking time} = \text{Number of potatoes still needed} \times \text{Time per potato}
\]

Substitute the calculated value from Step 1 into the equation:

\[
\text{Total cooking time} = 8 \times 6 = 48 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take the chef **48 minutes** to cook the remaining 8 potatoes.<|im_end|>",48

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trips Jerry will have to make based on his carrying capacity and the total number of trays.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the total number of trays:**
   - Jerry has to pick up trays from two different tables.
   - From one table, he needs to pick up 9 trays.
   - From another table, he needs to pick up 7 trays.
   
   Therefore, the total number of trays is \(9 + 7 = 16\).

2. **Calculate the number of trips required:**
   - Jerry can carry 8 trays per trip.
   - To find out how many trips are needed, divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total number of trays}}{\text{Number of trays per trip}} \]

\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]

3. **Verify if Jerry can complete all trips in just 2 trips:**
   - In 2 trips, Jerry would be able to carry \(2 \times 8 = 16\) trays.
   - This exactly matches the total number of trays he needs to pick up.

Therefore, Jerry will make **2** trips to pick up all the trays. 

### Conclusion:
Jerry will make **2 trips** to pick up all the trays.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate Faye's total score based on the number of treasures she has found in both levels.

Step 1: Calculate the score from the first level.
- Number of treasures found at the first level = 2
- Points per treasure found at the first level = 7

\[
\text{Score at the first level} = \text{Number of treasures found} \times \text{Points per treasure}
\]

\[
\text{Score at the first level} = 2 \times 7 = 14
\]

Step 2: Calculate the score from the second level.
- Number of treasures found at the second level = 6
- Points per treasure found at the second level = 7

\[
\text{Score at the second level} = \text{Number of treasures found} \times \text{Points per treasure}
\]

\[
\text{Score at the second level} = 6 \times 7 = 42
\]

Step 3: Add the scores from both levels together to get the total score.

\[
\text{Total score} = \text{Score at the first level} + \text{Score at the second level}
\]

\[
\text{Total score} = 14 + 42 = 56
\]

Therefore, Faye's total score is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many files Wendy deleted.
2. Calculate how many files were left after deleting.
3. Divide the remaining files by the number of files per folder to find out how many folders she used.

Let's go through each step:

### Step 1: Determine how many files Wendy deleted
Wendy initially had 82 files. She deleted 37% of them.

\[
0.37 \times 82 = 30.14 \approx 30 \text{ (since we can't have a fraction of a file)}
\]

So, Wendy deleted approximately 30 files.

### Step 2: Calculate how many files were left after deleting
Subtract the number of deleted files from the total number of files:

\[
82 - 30 = 52 \text{ files}
\]

### Step 3: Divide the remaining files by the number of files per folder
Wendy wants to place the remaining files into folders with 5 files each. We divide the number of remaining files by 5:

\[
52 \div 5 = 10.4
\]

Since Wendy cannot create a fraction of a folder, she will use 10 full folders, but there will be some files left over that do not fill another complete folder.

Therefore, Wendy ends up with **10** folders, with 2 files left unaccounted for.<|im_end|>",9

                    question:
                     Will made 104 , dollars , mowing lawns ! over the summer. If he ? spent 41 dollars buying new ! mower , blades, how many 9 dollar games could he buy with the : money ; he ! had left? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount Will had initially**

Will started with $104.

**Step 2: Subtract the cost of buying a new mower and blades from his initial amount**

He spent $41 on a new mower and blades.
So, we subtract $41 from $104 to find out how much money he has left after this purchase.

$104 - $41 = $63

**Step 3: Determine how many $9 game sets he can buy with the remaining money**

Now that we know he has $63 left, we need to figure out how many $9 game sets he can afford with these funds.

We do this by dividing the remaining money by the price of one game set ($9).

$63 ÷ $9 = 7

Therefore, Will can buy **7** $9 game sets with the money he has left after purchasing the mower and blades.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is: The final answer is 7.<|im_end|>",7

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many carrots Nancy has after throwing some away**

- Nancy initially picks 12 carrots.
- She throws out 2 carrots.

So, we subtract the number of thrown-out carrots from the initial count:

\[ \text{Total after throwing} = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

**Step 2: Add the new carrots picked on the next day**

- On the second day, Nancy picks an additional 21 carrots.

Now, add these to the remaining carrots after throwing:

\[ \text{Final total} = 10 + 21 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the final total**

Let's perform the addition in Step 2:

\[ 10 + 21 = 31 \]

Therefore, Nancy would have **31 carrots** in total.<|im_end|>",31

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of puppies left after selling some:**
   - The store initially has 13 puppies.
   - They sell 7/10 of the puppies.

2. **Subtract the number of sold puppies from the total number of puppies:**

   \[
   \text{Number of puppies sold} = \frac{7}{10} \times 13 = 9.1 \approx 9 \text{ (since it's not possible to sell a fraction of a puppy)}

   Therefore, the remaining number of puppies is:

   \[
   13 - 9 = 4 \text{ puppies}
   \]

3. **Determine how many cages are needed for the remaining puppies:**
   
   Each cage holds 2 puppies.

   To find out how many cages are required, divide the number of remaining puppies by the capacity of each cage:

   \[
   \text{Number of cages} = \left\lceil \frac{4}{2} \right\rceil = 2 \text{ cages}

                    question:
                     : Carol was playing a : trivia game. In , the . first round she scored 17 ; points ! and in the ! second round she scored 6 : points. In the : last round she lost 16 . points. How many points did she have at ! the end of , the , game? ! 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of points Carol accumulated throughout her game.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **First Round Calculation:**
   - Points from the first round: \( 17 \)

2. **Second Round Calculation:**
   - Points from the second round: \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) (since \( 6 \) times \( 4 \) equals \( 24 \))

3. **Last Round Calculation:**
   - Points from the last round: \( -16 \)

4. **Summing Up All Points:**
   - Total points after all rounds: \( 17 + 24 - 16 \)

Let's perform the arithmetic:

\[ 17 + 24 - 16 = 31 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{31}

                    question:
                     ? Dave bought 12 . boxes of chocolate candy and gave 5 to ! his : little brother. If each box has 3 : pieces inside , it, ; how many , pieces did ; Dave still have? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of boxes Dave originally had:**
   - Dave bought 12 boxes.

2. **Calculate the total number of pieces in all the boxes initially:**
   - Each box contains 3 pieces.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces = \( 12 \text{ boxes} \times 3 \text{ pieces/box} \).

   \[
   12 \times 3 = 36 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Subtract the number of boxes given away:**
   - Dave gave 5 boxes to his little brother.

4. **Calculate the remaining number of boxes Dave has:**
   - Total boxes initially - Boxes given away = Remaining boxes.

   \[
   12 \text{ boxes} - 5 \text{ boxes} = 7 \text{ boxes}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining number of pieces in these boxes:**
   - Each box still contains 3 pieces.
   - Therefore, the remaining pieces = \( 7 \text{ boxes} \times 3 \text{ pieces/box} \).

   \[
   7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ pieces}
   \]

So, Dave still has **21** pieces of chocolate candy.<|im_end|>",21

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of customers served.
- The waiter initially had 39 customers waiting.
- He added an additional 12 customers during the lunch rush.

Total number of customers served = Initial customers + Additional customers
= 39 + 12
= 51 customers

### Step 2: Identify who left a tip.
- We know that out of the 49 customers who didn't leave a tip, all other customers must have left a tip.

Since the waiter served 51 customers in total and only 49 of them didn't leave a tip, the remaining customers must be those who did leave a tip.

Number of customers who left a tip = Total customers - Customers who didn't leave a tip
= 51 - 49
= 2 customers

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{2}\).<|im_end|>",2

2. **Calculate how many pies can be made using the remaining apples:**
   - Each pie requires 5 apples.
   - Divide the remaining apples (45) by the number of apples per pie (5): \( 45 \div 5 = 9 \).

Therefore, the cafeteria can make 9 pies with the remaining apples.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is: {The final answer is} 9 pies.<|im_end|>",9
