                    question:
                     Paige ! had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from it and then added 8 new songs, how ; many songs ? does she have on her mp3 player? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of songs**: Paige initially has 11 songs on her MP3 player.
2. **Songs deleted**: She deletes 9 songs from her MP3 player.
   - Subtracting 9 from 11 gives us: \( 11 - 9 = 2 \).
3. **Songs added**: After deleting the songs, she adds 8 new songs to her MP3 player.
   - Adding 8 to the remaining 2 songs gives us: \( 2 + 8 = 10 \).

Therefore, after all the changes, Paige has 10 songs on her MP3 player.

                    question:
                     There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the ! schools basketball team. If only 26 of them got called back, how many ? students didn't make the ! cut? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many students did not make it to tryouts, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of students who tried out:**
   - Number of girls = 39
   - Number of boys = 4
   - Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys
     \[
     \text{Total number of students} = 39 + 4 = 43
     \]

2. **Determine the number of students who got called back:**
   - Number of students called back = 26

3. **Subtract the number of students called back from the total number of students to find those who did not get called back:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students who did not make it} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Number of students called back}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of students who did not make it} = 43 - 26 = 17

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of enemies remaining after destroying some.
2. Calculate the points earned based on the remaining enemies.

Let's go through it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of enemies remaining
- Total enemies in the level: 11
- Number of enemies destroyed: 11 - 3 = 8 (since you destroy all but 3)

So, there are 8 enemies left.

### Step 2: Calculate the points earned
- Points per enemy defeated: 9
- Number of enemies remaining: 8

Now, calculate the total points:
\[ \text{Total points} = \text{Points per enemy} \times \text{Number of enemies remaining} \]
\[ \text{Total points} = 9 \times 8 \]

Perform the multiplication:

To determine how many points Megan would earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bags Megan actually recycled:**
   - Megan originally had 14 bags.
   - She did not recycle 5 of those bags.

\[
14 \text{ bags} - 5 \text{ bags} = 9 \text{ bags}
\]

2. **Determine the points per bag:**
   - Megan earns 8 points for each bag she recycles.

3. **Calculate the total points based on the number of bags recycled:**
   - Since she recycled 9 bags and gets 8 points per bag,

\[
9 \text{ bags} \times 8 \text{ points/bag} = 72 \text{ points}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of shirts Ned needs to wash.
Ned has to wash both short sleeve shirts (which we'll assume are also long sleeves) and long sleeve shirts.

- Short sleeve shirts: 9
- Long sleeve shirts: 21

Total number of shirts = 9 (short sleeve) + 21 (long sleeve) = 30 shirts

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of shirts Ned actually washed.
Ned has already washed 29 shirts.

### Step 3: Find out how many shirts Ned didn't wash.
Since he needed to wash 30 shirts in total but has washed 29 shirts, the number of shirts he didn't wash can be calculated as follows:

Number of shirts not washed = Total number of shirts - Number of shirts washed

Plugging in the numbers:
Number of shirts not washed = 30 - 29 = 1 shirt

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The number of shirts Ned did not wash is **1**.<|im_end|>",1

To determine how many tables are needed for the remaining attendees, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of attendees who actually showed up:**
   - Total number of people invited: 47
   - Number of people who didn't show up: 7
   - Number of people who did show up = Total number of people invited - Number of people who didn't show up
     \[
     47 - 7 = 40
     \]

2. **Determine how many tables are required if each table holds 5 people:**
   - Number of people per table: 5
   - Calculate the total number of tables needed by dividing the number of people who showed up by the capacity of each table.
     \[
     \frac{40}{5} = 8

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of books**: Tom starts with 5 books.

2. **Books sold**: Tom sells 4 books.
   - After selling these books, he has \( 5 - 4 = 1 \) book left.

3. **Money from sale**: The money he earns from selling the books can be used to buy more books. However, we don't know the exact amount he earned from selling his books because that information isn't provided in the problem statement. For now, we will focus on the number of books he has after selling them.

4. **Books bought with earnings**: Tom uses the money he earned from selling the books to buy 38 new books.
   - Since we only know the initial number of books (1), we need to determine if there was enough money to buy 38 books based on the remaining books he has.

Since the total number of books he ends up with doesn't depend on the specific amount he earned but rather on the net change in the number of books he owns over time, the final number of books he has remains unchanged at 1 book.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 1 book.<|im_end|>",39

   - Total sodas = 41 (regular) + 22 (diet) = 63 sodas

2. **Determine how many sodas fit on one shelf:**
   - The fridge can hold 9 sodas per shelf.

3. **Calculate the number of shelves needed:**
   - Number of shelves required = Total number of sodas / Sodas per shelf
   - Number of shelves required = 63 sodas / 9 sodas per shelf

4. **Perform the division:**
   - Number of shelves required = 63 ÷ 9 = 7

Therefore, Jerry will fill up 7 shelves in his fridge.

**Step 1: Determine the number of windows that still need to be installed.**

- Total windows needed for the building: 14
- Windows already installed: 8
- Therefore, the number of windows left to install = Total windows - Installed windows
= 14 - 8
= 6

So, there are **6 windows** that still need to be installed.

**Step 2: Calculate the total time required to install these remaining windows.**

- Time taken to install one window: 8 hours
- Number of remaining windows: 6

Therefore, the total time required to install all remaining windows = Time per window × Number of windows
= 8 hours/window × 6 windows
= 48 hours

**Final Answer:** It will take the builder **48 hours** to install the remaining windows.<|im_end|>",48

                    question:
                     A : store had 40 ; oranges in a bin. : If they threw away 25 of the old ones and put 21 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. **Initial Count**: The store initially has 40 oranges in the bin.

2. **Throwing Away Oranges**:
   - They throw away 25 of the old oranges.
   - We subtract these from the initial count: \( 40 - 25 = 15 \).

3. **Adding New Oranges**:
   - Then, they add 21 new oranges to the bin.
   - We add these to the remaining count after throwing away some: \( 15 + 21 = 36 \).

Therefore, at the end, there will be 36 oranges in the bin.

{The final answer is} 36 oranges.<|im_end|>",36

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of customers who tipped:**
   - Total customers = 7
   - Customers who didn't tip = 5
   - Therefore, customers who did tip = Total customers - Customers who didn't tip
   \[
   \text{Customers who tipped} = 7 - 5 = 2
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount earned from tipping:**
   - Each customer who tipped received $3.
   - Number of customers who tipped = 2
   - Therefore, total earnings = Amount per tipper × Number of tippers
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 3 \times 2 = \$6

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of chicken wings cooked:**
   - The chef already had 9 chicken wings cooked.
   - They cooked an additional 7 more for the group.
   - Total chicken wings = 9 (initial) + 7 (additional) = 16 chicken wings.

2. **Calculate the total number of people in the group:**
   - There are 4 friends in the group.

3. **Divide the total number of chicken wings equally among all members of the group:**
   - Number of chicken wings per person = Total chicken wings / Number of people

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of worksheets**: The teacher initially has 34 worksheets.
2. **Worksheets already graded**: She has graded 7 worksheets so far.
3. **New worksheets added**: Another 36 worksheets were turned in.

Now, we need to determine how many more worksheets she will have to grade after adding the new ones.

**Step-by-step Reasoning:**

- Start with the initial count of 34 worksheets.
- Add the 7 worksheets that have been graded.
- Calculate the total number of worksheets after grading those 7.
- Add the additional 36 worksheets that were turned in.

Let's perform these calculations:

\[ \text{Total worksheets} = 34 + (7 - 0) + 36 \]

Here, \(7 - 0\) means the 7 worksheets that have already been graded do not contribute to the count because they are already counted as part of the original 34 worksheets.

So, the calculation simplifies to:

\[ \text{Total worksheets} = 34 + 7 + 36 \]
\[ \text{Total worksheets} = 57 \]

Therefore, the teacher will have to grade a total of 57 worksheets.

<|im_start|>super
To determine the total cost for the group at the restaurant, we need to consider both adults and children's meals.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the number of adults:**
   - The total number of people in the group is 13.
   - Out of these, 9 are kids.
   - Therefore, the number of adults is \( 13 - 9 = 4 \).

2. **Determine the cost per meal:**
   - Each adult meal costs $7.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the adults:**
   - Since there are 4 adults and each meal costs $7,
     \[
     \text{Total cost for adults} = 4 \times 7 = \$28
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for the children:**
   - There are no restrictions on the number of kids (since they eat for free).
   - Since all 9 kids eat for free, the cost for the children is $0.

5. **Sum up the total cost:**
   - Add the total cost for adults ($28) and the total cost for children ($0):

                    question:
                     Wendy uploaded 79 pictures to Facebook. She put 44 pics into one album and put the rest into 5 different albums. How many pictures were ; in each , album? : 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pictures left after putting some into an album:**
   - Wendy initially had 79 pictures.
   - She placed 44 pictures into one album.
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   79 - 44 = 35
   \]
   So, she has 35 pictures left.

2. **Determine how many pictures are in each of the 5 albums:**
   - We have 35 pictures remaining and they need to be divided equally among 5 albums.
   
   To find out how many pictures are in each album, divide the total number of remaining pictures by the number of albums:
   \[
   \frac{35}{5} = 7
   \]

So, each of the five albums contains 7 pictures.

\[
\boxed{7}

                     The schools debate team had . 5 boys and 40 girls on it. If they were split into groups of 9 : how many groups could they make? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many groups of 9 can be made from the debate team, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of students in the debate team:**
   - There are 5 boys.
   - There are 40 girls.

   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 5 + 40 = 45
   \]

2. **Determine how many groups of 9 can be formed from the total number of students:**
   - We need to divide the total number of students (45) by the group size (9).

   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Group size}} = \frac{45}{9}
   \]

3. **Perform the division:**

   \[
   \frac{45}{9} = 5
   \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can be formed is \(5\).

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many members actually showed up for the game.
2. Calculate the total number of points scored based on the number of members who showed up.

Let's go through these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Determine how many members showed up for the game
- The trivia team originally had 11 members.
- During the game, 6 members didn't show up.

So, the number of members who showed up = Total members - Members who didn't show up
= 11 - 6
= 5

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of points scored
Each member who showed up scores 9 points. Since there were 5 members who showed up, the total score can be calculated as follows:

Total points = Number of members who showed up × Points per member
= 5 × 9
= 45

Therefore, the total number of points scored in the game is **45**.<|im_end|>",45

   - Initially, there were 2 friends playing.
   
2. **Players Joining the Game:**
   - 2 more players join the game.

3. **Total Number of Players After Joining:**
   - We need to calculate the total number of players after the new players join.
     \[
     \text{Total Players} = \text{Initial Players} + \text{New Players}
     \]
     Substituting the values:

                    ;  Adam , had 48 books. If he sold 19 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Adam have? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine how much money Adam made from selling his books.
- Adam initially has 48 books.
- He sells 19 books.
- Therefore, the amount of money he makes from selling 19 books can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Money made} = \frac{\text{Number of books sold}}{\text{Books per dollar}} \times \text{Price per book} \]

Since the price per book is not given directly in the problem, let's assume it is $P$ for now.

So, if we denote the total money Adam makes from selling 19 books as \( M \), then:
\[ M = 19 \times P \]

Step 2: Calculate how many books Adam buys with the money he made.
- Adam uses the money he earned to buy 38 new books.
- Let’s say the price of each new book is also $P$ (since the price per book remains constant).

So, the number of books Adam buys with his money can be represented as:
\[ \text{Number of books bought} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Price per book}} \]
\[ \text{Number of books bought} = \frac{M}{P} \]

Given that Adam buys 38 books using the money he earned from selling 19 books, we can write:
\[ 38 = \frac{19P}{P} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 38 = 19 \]

Step 3: Subtract the number of books sold from the initial number of books.
- Adam originally had 48 books.
- He sold 19 books.

Therefore, the remaining number of books after selling some is:
\[ \text{Remaining books} = 48 - 19 \]

Calculating this gives us:
\[ \text{Remaining books} = 29 \]

Step 4: Add the number of books Adam bought to the remaining books.
- After selling 19 books, Adam has 29 books left.
- He buys another 38 books.

Adding these together:
\[ \text{Final number of books} = 29 + 38 \]

Calculating this gives us:
\[ \text{Final number of books} = 67 \]

### Conclusion:
Adam would have **67** books after buying more books and selling some of his original collection.<|im_end|>",67

Luke has to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another table. So, the total number of trays is:

\[ 20 \text{ trays} + 16 \text{ trays} = 36 \text{ trays} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of trips required**
Since Luke can carry 4 trays per trip, we divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry in one trip:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ trays}}{4 \text{ trays/trip}} = 9 \text{ trips} \]

Therefore, Luke will make **9 trips** to pick up all the trays.<|im_end|>",9

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of carrots picked:**
   - Vanessa picked 17 carrots.
   - Her mother picked 14 carrots.
   
   Total carrots picked = Vanessa's carrots + Mother's carrots
   
   \[
   \text{Total carrots} = 17 + 14 = 31
   \]

2. **Identify the number of good carrots:**
   - Only 24 out of the total carrots are considered good.

3. **Calculate the number of bad carrots:**
   - The total number of carrots minus the number of good carrots gives us the number of bad carrots.

   \[
   \text{Number of bad carrots} = \text{Total carrots} - \text{Good carrots}
   \]
   
   Substituting in our numbers:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of brownies left to bake**

Tiffany initially had 8 brownies, but needs a total of 17 brownies. Therefore, the number of additional brownies she needs is:
\[ \text{Brownies left} = 17 - 8 = 9 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of flour needed per brownie**

We know that Tiffany uses 8 cups of flour for each brownie.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of flour already used**

She has already used 8 cups of flour for each of the 8 brownies she baked.
\[ \text{Flour used} = 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining amount of flour needed**

Now, let's find out how much more flour she needs to use for the remaining 9 brownies.
\[ \text{Remaining flour needed} = 9 \times 8 = 72 \text{ cups} \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many folders Nancy ended up with, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of files left after deletion**
- Nancy started with 80 files.
- She deleted 31 files.

\[ \text{Files remaining} = 80 - 31 = 49 \]

**Step 2: Determine how many folders are needed for the remaining files**
- Each folder holds 7 files.
- We need to find out how many such groups (folders) can be formed from the 49 remaining files.

\[ \text{Number of folders} = \frac{\text{Total files}}{\text{Files per folder}} = \frac{49}{7} \]

**Step 3: Perform the division to get the number of folders**
\[ \frac{49}{7} = 7 \]

Therefore, Nancy ended up with **7 folders**.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \( \boxed{7} \).<|im_end|>",7

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of students**: We start by calculating the total number of students who tried out for the school's trivia teams. This is given as 65.

2. **Determine the number of students not selected**: According to the information provided, 17 students did not get picked for the team.

3. **Find the number of students selected for the team**: Subtract the number of unselected students from the total number of students. This will give us the number of students who were selected.

4. **Divide the number of selected students by the number of groups**: Since these students are being divided into 8 groups, we divide the number of selected students by 8 to find out how many students are in each group.

Let's go through these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of students
Total number of students = 65

### Step 2: Determine the number of students not selected
Number of unselected students = 17

### Step 3: Find the number of students selected for the team
Number of selected students = Total number of students - Number of unselected students
\[ \text{Number of selected students} = 65 - 17 \]
\[ \text{Number of selected students} = 48 \]

### Step 4: Divide the number of selected students by the number of groups
Number of students per group = Number of selected students / Number of groups
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = 48 / 8 \]
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = 6 \]

Therefore, each group would have **6** students.<|im_end|>",6

   \[
   25 - 10 = 15
   \]

4. **Number of remaining pictures to be distributed among 5 different albums**:
   - There are no restrictions on how these remaining pictures should be divided among the five different albums; they can go into any combination as long as they total up to the remaining 15 pictures.

5. **Distribute the remaining pictures into 5 different albums**:
   - Since there are no further constraints given about how the pictures should be split between the five albums, we assume an equal distribution for simplicity.
   - Divide the 15 remaining pictures equally among the 5 albums.
   \[
   \frac{15}{5} = 3
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Each of the 5 albums will contain 3 pictures.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the number of pages for each subject:**
   - Math homework: 2 pages
   - Reading homework: ?
   
2. **Determine the number of pages for reading homework based on the information given about the total number of pages (math and reading combined):**
   - We know that Isabel has 2 pages of math homework.
   - Let's denote the number of pages of reading homework as \( x \).
   - The total number of pages is then \( 2 + x \).

3. **Calculate the total number of problems in both subjects:**
   - Each page contains 5 problems.
   - For math homework, there are 2 pages, so the total number of problems is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) problems.

4. **Set up an equation to find the number of reading pages (\( x \)):**
   - Since the total number of pages equals the sum of math and reading pages, we can write: \( 2 + x = 6 \).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: \( x = 4 \).

6. **Verify the solution:**
   - With \( x = 4 \), the total number of pages is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).
   - This matches our assumption since the total number of pages must equal the sum of math and reading pages.

7. **Calculate the total number of reading problems:**
   - Since each page contains 5 problems, the total number of reading problems is \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) problems.

8. **Add the total number of math and reading problems together:**
   - Total problems = Problems in math homework + Problems in reading homework
   - Total problems = \( 10 + 20 = 30 \)

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    question:
                     Adam had 33 books. If he sold 11 : of them and used the money he earned to buy 23 new books, ? how many books would Adam have? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many books Adam sold.
Adam initially had 33 books. He sold \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his books.

\[
\text{Number of books sold} = \frac{1}{3} \times 33 = 11 \text{ books}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Adam earned from selling the books.
Since we don't know the price per book, we can assume that the money earned is proportional to the number of books sold (as no other information about prices or quantities sold is provided).

Given that he sold 11 books, let's assume he earned $X for these 11 books. Since the exact price isn't given, we'll just use this as an intermediate value for calculation purposes.

\[
\text{Total earnings} = X
\]

### Step 3: Use the earnings to buy new books.
Adam uses the money he earned to buy 23 new books.

\[
\text{Money spent on new books} = 23 \times Y
\]
where \(Y\) is the cost per book.

However, since we don't have the specific cost per book, we'll focus on the initial number of books remaining after selling some.

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining books after selling.
After selling 11 books, Adam has:

\[
\text{Remaining books} = 33 - 11 = 22 \text{ books}
\]

### Step 5: Add the newly bought books.
Adam then buys 23 new books with the money he earned.

\[
\text{Newly bought books} = 23 \text{ books}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total number of books Adam has now.
Adding the remaining books to the newly bought books:

\[
\text{Final number of books} = 22 + 23 = 45 \text{ books}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of books left for Oliver.
- Total number of books initially = 46
- Number of books taken by the librarian = 10
- Number of books left for Oliver = 46 - 10 = 36

### Step 2: Calculate how many shelves Oliver needs if he can place 4 books per shelf.
- Books that can be placed on one shelf = 4
- Total number of books left = 36
- Number of shelves needed = Total number of books ÷ Books per shelf

Step 1: Determine the number of coins per pile.
- Luke has 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes.
- Each pile contains 3 coins.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of coins for the quarters.
- Since there are 5 piles of quarters and each pile contains 3 coins,
\[ \text{Total quarters} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of coins for the dimes.
- Similarly, since there are 5 piles of dimes and each pile contains 3 coins,
\[ \text{Total dimes} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Step 4: Add the total number of coins from both types of coins.
\[ \text{Total coins} = \text{Total quarters} + \text{Total dimes} \]
\[ \text{Total coins} = 15 + 15 = 30 \]

= 8 + 16  
= 24 cards

**Step 2: Determine how many pages are needed for the cards**
Each page can hold 3 cards.

To find out how many pages are required, divide the total number of cards by the number of cards per page:

Pages needed = Total number of cards / Cards per page  
= 24 / 3  
= 8 pages

Therefore, **the final answer is**: 8 pages.<|im_end|>",8

                     Isabel baked 3 brownies, ? but . needed 5 total for her party. If she used 5 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour . does she still need? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of brownies left to bake:**
   - Isabel initially baked 3 brownies.
   - She needs a total of 5 brownies.
   - Therefore, she still needs \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) brownies.

2. **Calculate the amount of flour already used:**
   - Each brownie requires 5 cups of flour.
   - Since she has baked 3 brownies so far, she has used \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) cups of flour.

3. **Calculate the amount of flour still needed:**
   - The total amount of flour required is 5 cups per brownie.
   - With 2 more brownies to bake, she will use \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) cups of flour in total.
   - Since she has already used 15 cups, the remaining amount of flour needed is \( 10 - 15 = -5 \).

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Isabel has already exceeded the total flour requirement by 5 cups. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} -5 cups of flour.<|im_end|>",10

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of tickets Tom has:**
   - Tom bought 40 tickets in total.

2. **Subtract the number of tickets used for the 'dunk a clown' booth from the total tickets:**
   - Tom spent 28 tickets on the 'dunk a clown' booth.
   - Subtracting these from the total gives us \( 40 - 28 = 12 \) tickets remaining.

3. **Calculate the number of rides Tom can take based on the remaining tickets:**
   - Each ride costs 4 tickets.
   - To find out how many rides Tom can take, we divide the remaining tickets by the cost per ride:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of customers initially:**
   The waiter started with 22 customers.

2. **Calculate the number of customers who left:**
   Out of these 22 customers, 14 left. So, we subtract 14 from 22 to find out how many customers remain.
   
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]

3. **Determine the number of customers per table after some leave:**
   After 14 customers left, there were 8 remaining customers. Each table has 4 people at it.

4. **Calculate the number of tables needed for the remaining customers:**
   To find out how many tables are needed for 8 customers if each table holds 4 people, divide the number of remaining customers by the capacity of each table.
   
   \[
   \frac{8}{4} = 2

   - He added 48 pieces to one load.
   - Therefore, the number of pieces left for splitting is \( 120 - 48 = 72 \).

2. **Divide these remaining pieces equally among 9 loads:**
   - We need to divide 72 pieces by 9 to find out how many pieces will be in each load.
   - Perform the division: \( 72 ÷ 9 = 8 \).

3. **Conclusion:**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, let's break down the information given:

1. At the start of the year, there were 10 students.
2. During the year, 4 students left the school.
3. Additionally, 42 new students joined the school.

Let's calculate step by step:

### Step 1: Subtract the number of students who left from the initial count
- Initial number of students = 10
- Number of students who left = 4
- Students remaining after leaving = \( 10 - 4 \)

\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \]

So, after the 4 students left, there were 6 students remaining in the class.

### Step 2: Add the number of new students who joined
- Number of students who joined = 42
- Number of students after joining = \( 6 + 42 \)

\[ 6 + 42 = 48 \]

Therefore, after all these changes, there were **48** students in the fourth-grade class at the end of the year.<|im_end|>",48

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of books left for Roger**
Roger starts with 14 books in total. A librarian takes 2 books from him.

\[ \text{Books left for Roger} = 14 - 2 = 12 \]

So, Roger has 12 books remaining.

**Step 2: Calculate how many shelves Roger needs if he can place 3 books per shelf**

If Roger can place 3 books on each shelf, we divide the number of books he has by 3 to find out how many shelves he will need.

\[ \text{Number of shelves needed} = \frac{\text{Books left}}{\text{Books per shelf}} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of apples ordered.
2. Calculate the total number of apples distributed based on the number of students who want fruit.
3. Subtract the number of apples distributed from the total number of apples ordered to find out how many extra apples were left.

Let's go through it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Total Number of Apples Ordered
- Red apples: 6
- Green apples: 15
Total number of apples = Red apples + Green apples
= 6 + 15
= 21 apples

### Step 2: Number of Apples Distributed Based on Students Wanting Fruit
- Number of students wanting fruit: 5
Number of apples distributed = Number of students wanting fruit * (Red apples / Green apples)
Since there are more red apples than green apples, we can assume that all students will get an apple, regardless of color. This means each student gets one apple regardless of the colors present in the order.

### Step 3: Extra Apples Left
Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples distributed
= 21 - 5
= 16 apples

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with **16 extra apples**.<|im_end|>",16

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total amount Mike has after spending on mower blades.**

Mike starts with $42 from mowing lawns.

He spends $10 on new mower blades.

So, his remaining amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = \text{Initial Amount} - \text{Spent Amount} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 42 - 10 \]

Let's calculate the remaining amount.
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 32 \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much money Mike can spend on 8-dollar video games.**

After buying mower blades, Mike has $32 left.

Each game costs $8.

Therefore, to find out how many games he can buy, we divide the remaining amount by the cost per game:
\[ \text{Number of Games} = \frac{\text{Remaining Amount}}{\text{Cost per Game}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Games} = \frac{32}{8} \]

Now, let's calculate the number of games.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of potatoes left to be cooked**
- Total potatoes needed = 13
- Potatoes already cooked = 5
- Potatoes left to be cooked = Total - Cooked = 13 - 5 = 8

So far, we have calculated that there are 8 more potatoes to be cooked.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cooking time for all potatoes**
- Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.
- Total potatoes = 8 (already cooked) + 8 (left to cook) = 16 potatoes in total.
- Time per potato = 6 minutes.
- Total cooking time = Number of potatoes × Time per potato = 16 × 6 = 96 minutes.

Therefore, it will take the chef 96 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many baggies Robin can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of cookies available:**
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 23
   - Oatmeal cookies: 25
   - Total cookies = 23 + 25 = 48 cookies

2. **Calculate the maximum number of baggies based on the given cookie count per baggie:**
   - Each baggie contains 6 cookies.
   - To find out how many baggies can be made from 48 cookies, divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per baggie.

\[
\text{Number of baggies} = \frac{\text{Total cookies}}{\text{Cookies per baggie}} = \frac{48}{6}
\]

3. **Perform the division:**

\[
\frac{48}{6} = 8
\]

So, Robin can make a maximum of 8 baggies.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of cans Sam collected on Saturday.
2. Calculate the number of cans Sam collected on Sunday.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total.

Let's start with Step 1:

On Saturday, Sam filled 3 bags. Each bag contains 9 cans. So, the number of cans he collected on Saturday is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Saturday cans} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

Next, let's move to Step 2:

On Sunday, Sam also filled 4 bags. Each bag again contains 9 cans. So, the number of cans he collected on Sunday is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Sunday cans} = 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

Now, let's combine both amounts from Steps 1 and 2 to find the total number of cans Sam picked up:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of problems in one worksheet.
Each worksheet has 4 problems.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of problems across all worksheets that the teacher needs to grade.
Since there are 16 worksheets and each worksheet has 4 problems, the total number of problems is:
\[ \text{Total Problems} = 16 \times 4 \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ 16 \times 4 = 64 \]
So, the teacher needs to grade 64 problems in total.

### Step 3: Calculate how many problems the teacher has already graded.
The teacher has already graded 8 problems.

### Step 4: Subtract the number of problems already graded from the total number of problems to find out how many more problems the teacher still needs to grade.
\[ \text{Problems Remaining to Grade} = \text{Total Problems} - \text{Problems Already Graded} \]

Substitute the values we found:
\[ \text{Problems Remaining to Grade} = 64 - 8 \]

Perform the subtraction:
\[ 64 - 8 = 56 \]

Therefore, the teacher still needs to grade **56** problems.<|im_end|>",32

                    question:
                     A chef needs to cook 12 potatoes. He has : already cooked 6. If each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, : how long will it take ? him to cook the rest? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many potatoes still need to be cooked and then calculate the time required for that.

Step 1: Determine how many potatoes are left to be cooked.
Total potatoes needed = 12
Potatoes already cooked = 6
Remaining potatoes to be cooked = Total potatoes - Potatoes already cooked = 12 - 6 = 6

Step 2: Calculate the total cooking time based on the number of remaining potatoes.
Each potato takes 6 minutes to cook.
Time to cook remaining potatoes = Number of remaining potatoes × Time per potato = 6 × 6 = 36 minutes

Therefore, it will take 36 minutes for the chef to cook the remaining potatoes.

The final answer is: The final answer is 36 minutes.<|im_end|>",36

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of games**: Luke starts with 57 games.
2. **Number of games sold**: Luke sells 39 games.
3. **Calculate remaining games**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining games} = \text{Initial games} - \text{Games sold}

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Remaining games} = 57 - 39 = 18
   \]

4. **Determine how many boxes are needed**:
   Each box contains 2 games.
   To find the number of boxes required, we divide the total number of remaining games by the number of games per box:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Remaining games}}{\text{Games per box}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{18}{2} = 9

- The pet store initially has 13 puppies.
- They sell 7 puppies.

\[ \text{Remaining puppies} = 13 - 7 = 6 \]

**Step 2: Calculate how many cages are needed to house the remaining puppies**
- We know that each cage holds 2 puppies.

\[ \text{Number of cages} = \frac{\text{Remaining puppies}}{\text{Puppies per cage}} \]
\[ \text{Number of cages} = \frac{6}{2} \]
\[ \text{Number of cages} = 3 \]

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of carrots picked and then subtract the number of good carrots from that total.

Step 1: Determine the total number of carrots picked.
- Faye picked 23 carrots.
- Her mother picked 5 carrots.

Total number of carrots = Faye's carrots + Mother's carrots
= 23 + 5
= 28 carrots

Step 2: Subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots to find the number of bad carrots.
- Number of good carrots = 12

Number of bad carrots = Total carrots - Good carrots
= 28 - 12
= 16 carrots

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 16 bad carrots.<|im_end|>",16

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of flowers Isabel has initially.**
Isabel picks 66 flowers.

**Step 2: Calculate how many bouquets Isabel can make if no flowers wilted.**
She wants to make bouquets with 8 flowers per bouquet.
So, we divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets} = \frac{\text{Total flowers}}{\text{Flowers per bouquet}} \]
\[ \text{Number of bouquets} = \frac{66}{8} \]

Performing the division:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets} = 8.25 \]

Since Isabel cannot make a fraction of a bouquet, she can only make whole bouquets.

**Step 3: Adjust for the flowers that wilted.**
Out of the 66 flowers, 10 wilted before the wedding. This means she will have \( 66 - 10 = 56 \) flowers left after accounting for the wilted ones.

**Step 4: Recalculate the number of bouquets she can now make with the remaining flowers.**
Now, she has 56 flowers left. We need to determine how many full bouquets she can make with these 56 flowers.
\[ \text{New Number of bouquets} = \frac{\text{Remaining flowers}}{\text{Flowers per bouquet}} \]
\[ \text{New Number of bouquets} = \frac{56}{8} \]

Performing the division:
\[ \text{New Number of bouquets} = 7 \]

Therefore, after considering the flowers that wilted, Isabel can still make **7 bouquets**.<|im_end|>",7

To determine the total number of tickets Oliver used at the town carnival, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rides Oliver participated in.
2. Multiply that total by the number of tickets per ride.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of rides.
- Ferris wheel rides: 5
- Bumper car rides: 4
Total rides = Ferris wheel rides + Bumper car rides
             = 5 + 4
             = 9

Step 2: Multiply the total number of rides by the number of tickets per ride.
Each ride costs 7 tickets.
Total tickets used = Total rides × Tickets per ride
                  = 9 × 7
                  = 63

Therefore, Oliver used a total of 63 tickets.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of customers after adding more.
Initially, there were 39 customers.

During the lunch rush, he added an additional 12 customers.

So, we need to add these two numbers together:
\[ 39 + 12 = 51 \]

Thus, the total number of customers is now 51.

### Step 2: Identify who didn't leave a tip.
We're told that 49 out of the total 51 customers didn't leave a tip.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of customers who left a tip.
Since all 51 customers represent the total number of customers, and 49 of them didn't leave a tip, the remaining must have done so.

So, subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers:
\[ 51 - 49 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of customers who left a tip is **2**.

                    question:
                     While playing a trivia game, Frank answered 3 questions correct in the , first half and 2 questions correct in the second , half. If each question was worth 3 points, what was his ! final score? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of questions**: Since Frank played two halves of the game (first and second), we assume there were equal numbers of questions in both halves. Let's denote the total number of questions as \( N \). Therefore, Frank answered \( \frac{N}{2} \) questions correctly in each half.

2. **Calculate the total number of questions Frank answered correctly**:
   - In the first half: Frank answered 3 questions.
   - In the second half: Frank answered 2 questions.
   
   Adding these together gives us the total number of questions he answered correctly:
   \[
   3 + 2 = 5
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of questions Frank answered incorrectly**:
   - There are no other options mentioned for incorrect answers.

4. **Calculate the total points Frank earned**:
   - Each question is worth 3 points.
   - Therefore, if Frank answered 5 questions correctly, he would earn:
     \[
     5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ points}
     \]

5. **Summarize the final score**:
   - Frank’s final score is the sum of the points from correct answers and any penalties or deductions that might apply, but since no specific information about penalties is given, we consider only the points from correct answers.

Therefore, Frank’s final score is:
\[
\boxed{15}

                    question:
                     Zoe was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 8 boxes of clothing and inside each ! box there were 4 scarves ? and 6 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing ! did Zoe have total? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many items (scarves + mittens) are in one box.
2. Multiply that number by the total number of boxes to find out how many total items Zoe has.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of items in one box.
- Each box contains 4 scarves and 6 mittens.
- Therefore, each box has \(4 + 6 = 10\) items.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of items in all the boxes.
- Zoe has 8 boxes.
- Since each box contains 10 items, the total number of items is \(8 \times 10 = 80\).

So, Zoe has a total of 80 pieces of winter clothing. 

{The final answer is} The final answer is 80.<|im_end|>",80

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the cost per deck**: According to the information provided, each deck costs $7.

2. **Calculate how many decks Frank bought**:
   - Frank bought 3 decks.
   
3. **Calculate how many decks Frank's friend bought**:
   - Frank's friend bought 2 decks.

4. **Calculate the total number of decks bought together**:
   - Frank bought 3 decks + Friend's friend bought 2 decks = 5 decks in total.

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all decks**:
   - Since each deck costs $7, and they bought 5 decks, the total amount spent is \( 5 \times 7 = \$35 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: The total amount spent is $\boxed{35}$.<|im_end|>",35

                    question:
                     Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school . started, ? how many ? did he not wash? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many shirts Sam didn't wash, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of shirts:**
   - Short sleeve shirts: 40
   - Long sleeve shirts: 23
   - Total shirts = 40 + 23 = 63

2. **Determine how many shirts were washed:**
   - Shirts washed: 29

3. **Subtract the number of shirts washed from the total number of shirts:**
   - Number of shirts not washed = Total shirts - Shirts washed
   - Number of shirts not washed = 63 - 29 = 34

Therefore, the number of shirts that Sam did not wash is 34.

{The final answer is} 34<|im_end|>",34

                     A waiter . had 47 customers to wait on. If 41 customers left and . he got another 20 customers, how many customers would he have? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of customers**: The waiter initially has 47 customers.

2. **Customers who leave**: Out of these 47 customers, 41 leave. We need to subtract this from the initial total.
   \[
   47 - 41 = 6
   \]
   So, after 41 customers leave, there are 6 remaining customers.

3. **New customers arrive**: After some time, the waiter gets another 20 customers. We need to add these new customers to the current total.
   \[
   6 + 20 = 26
   \]

Therefore, at the end, the waiter would have 26 customers.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is: The final answer is 26.<|im_end|>",26
