                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money April earned from selling her roses during the sale, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of roses sold.
April started with 13 roses and has 4 roses left after the sale. Therefore, the number of roses sold is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of roses sold} = \text{Total initial roses} - \text{Roses left} \]
\[ \text{Number of roses sold} = 13 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of roses sold} = 9 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from the roses sold.
Each rose is priced at $4. So, the total revenue (which is the amount of money earned) can be found by multiplying the number of roses sold by the price per rose.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Number of roses sold} \times \text{Price per rose} \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 9 \times 4 \]

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of books**: Tom starts with 5 books.

2. **Books sold**: Tom sells 4 of his books.
   - After selling, the number of books left = Initial number of books - Books sold
   - Calculation: \( 5 - 4 = 1 \) book remaining.

3. **Money earned from sales**: The money earned from selling 4 books will be used to buy more books.
   - Let's denote the price per book as \( p \).
   - The total amount of money earned = Number of books sold × Price per book
   - Therefore, \( Total\ Money = 4p \).

4. **Number of books bought with money earned**: With the money earned, Tom buys 38 new books.
   - Since each book costs \( p \), the number of books that can be bought with the money is given by \( \frac{Total\ Money}{Price\ Per\ Book} \)
   - We know that \( Total\ Money = 4p \), so we need to find out how many books can be bought for \( 4p \).
   - Calculate the number of books that can be bought: \( \frac{4p}{p} = 4 \).

5. **Final number of books**: Adding the books bought to the books remaining after selling, we get:
   - Final number of books = Remaining books + Books bought
   - Calculation: \( 1 (remaining)\ + 4 (bought) = 5 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 5 books.<|im_end|>",39,39.0,5.0

                    question:
                     A new building needed 14 windows. The builder had already installed 8 of them. If it takes 8 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of windows that still need to be installed**
- Total number of windows required = 14
- Number of windows already installed = 8
- Number of windows remaining to be installed = 14 - 8 = 6

**Step 2: Calculate the total time required to install all windows**
- Time taken to install one window = 8 hours
- Therefore, for 6 windows, the total time required would be 6 * 8 hours.

Let's calculate the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Verify if the time calculation makes sense in context**
Since the builder has already completed 8 out of 14 windows, we can directly use the time calculated from Step 2 without needing additional information about installation efficiency or overlap between tasks.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\text{It will take 48 hours to install the remaining windows.}}

                     Wendy uploaded 79 pictures to Facebook. She put 44 pics into one album and put the rest into 5 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how many pictures are in each of the five albums, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pictures not placed in an album:**
   - Wendy initially uploaded 79 pictures.
   - She placed 44 pictures in one album.
   - Subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures.

\[
79 - 44 = 35 \text{ pictures}
\]

2. **Divide the remaining pictures among the 5 albums:**
   - We have 35 pictures left after placing some in one album.
   - Divide this number by 5 to find out how many pictures are in each of the other albums.

\[
35 \div 5 = 7 \text{ pictures per album}
\]

Therefore, each of the five albums contains 7 pictures.

**Final Answer:** Each album has **7 pictures**.<|im_end|>",7,7.0,7.0

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers available initially**
Wendy picked 103 flowers.

**Step 2: Determine how many flowers were used for the bouquets**
Since each bouquet contains 8 flowers, we divide the total number of flowers by 8.
\[ \frac{103}{8} = 12...5 \]
This means that Wendy can create 12 full bouquets and there will be 5 flowers left over (since \(103 - 96 = 7\)).

**Step 3: Subtract the flowers that wilted from the remaining flowers**
Out of the 12 bouquets, 47 flowers wilted, so we subtract those from the 7 leftover flowers.
\[ 7 - 47 = -40 \]

Since it's not possible to have negative flowers, this indicates that all 47 flowers that wilted cannot fit into any of the 12 bouquets.

Therefore, Wendy could only use the 12 bouquets that did not include the flowers that wilted.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine how many books Adam has after selling some.
Adam initially has 48 books. He sells 19 of those books.

Calculation:
\[ \text{Books left} = 48 - 19 \]
\[ \text{Books left} = 29 \]

Step 2: Calculate how much money Adam earns from selling his books.
Since the problem does not specify the price per book, we'll assume that the books were sold at face value for simplicity in this calculation. 

Calculation (Assuming $1 per book):
\[ \text{Money earned} = 19 \times 1 \]
\[ \text{Money earned} = \$19 \]

Step 3: Use the money earned to buy new books.
Adam uses the money earned ($19) to buy 38 new books.

Calculation:
\[ \text{New books bought} = 38 \]

Step 4: Calculate the total number of books Adam has now.
First, add the books he originally had to the new books he bought:
\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Books left} + \text{New books bought} \]

                     Henry had 3 action figures, but needed 8 total for a complete collection. If each one costs $6, how much money would he need to finish his collection? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Henry needs to finish his collection, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of additional action figures needed:**
   - Henry currently has 3 action figures.
   - He needs a total of 8 action figures.
   - Therefore, the number of additional action figures needed = \( 8 - 3 \).

2. **Calculate the cost of each additional action figure:**
   - Each action figure costs $6.

3. **Multiply the number of additional action figures by their individual cost:**
   - Number of additional action figures = \( 5 \) (since \( 8 - 3 = 5 \)).
   - Cost per additional action figure = $6.

4. **Find the total amount of money needed:**
   - Total cost = \( 5 \times 6 \).

Now let's perform the calculations:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Henry would need to finish his collection is \(\boxed{30}\).<|im_end|>",30,30.0,30.0

                    question:
                     Frank had saved up 3 dollars. If he received another 37 dollars for his allowance, how many 8 dollar toys could he buy? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many 8-dollar toys Frank can buy after receiving an additional $37 from his allowance, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Frank has:**
   - Frank initially saved $3.
   - He receives an additional $37.
   
   Therefore, the total amount of money Frank has is:
   \[
   3 + 37 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine how many 8-dollar toys Frank can buy with the total amount of money:**
   - Each toy costs $8.
   - We divide the total amount of money by the cost per toy.

   So, the number of toys Frank can buy is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{8} = 5
   \]

Therefore, Frank can buy 5 toys if he spends all his money on them at $8 each.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of carrots picked.
Vanessa picked 17 carrots, and her mom picked 14 carrots.

Total carrots = Vanessa's carrots + Mom's carrots
Total carrots = 17 + 14
Total carrots = 31

### Step 2: Calculate the number of good carrots.
Only 24 out of the 31 carrots are considered good.

Good carrots = Total carrots - Bad carrots
24 = 31 - Bad carrots

### Step 3: Solve for the number of bad carrots.
We need to find out how many carrots are not good (bad carrots).

Bad carrots = Total carrots - Good carrots
Bad carrots = 31 - 24
Bad carrots = 7

Therefore, there are **7** bad carrots in total.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of brownies Tiffany needs**

Tiffany initially baked 8 brownies.

She needs a total of 17 brownies for her party.

So, the number of additional brownies she needs = Total required - Initial baked
= 17 - 8
= 9 brownies

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of flour needed per brownie**

Each brownie requires 8 cups of flour.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of flour already used**

Tiffany has already used flour to bake 8 brownies.

Total flour used = Number of brownies × Flour per brownie
= 8 × 8
= 64 cups of flour

**Step 4: Calculate the amount of flour still needed**

Flour still needed = Total flour required - Flour already used
= (17 × 8) - 64

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many more problems the teacher has left to grade, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of problems in all worksheets:**
   - Each worksheet contains 7 problems.
   - The teacher has 17 worksheets.
   
   \[
   \text{Total number of problems} = \text{Number of worksheets} \times \text{Problems per worksheet}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of problems} = 17 \times 7 = 119
   \]

2. **Determine the number of problems that have been graded so far:**
   - The teacher has already graded 8 worksheets.
   - Since each worksheet has 7 problems, we calculate the total number of problems graded as follows:
   
   \[
   \text{Problems graded} = \text{Number of graded worksheets} \times \text{Problems per worksheet}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Problems graded} = 8 \times 7 = 56

3. **Subtract the number of graded problems from the total number of problems to find out how many remain to be graded:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining problems to be graded} = \text{Total number of problems} - \text{Problems graded}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining problems to be graded} = 119 - 56 = 63

To determine how many books Roger will have after selling some and buying more, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of books:**
   Roger starts with 25 books.

2. **Books sold:**
   Roger sells 21 books.
   
   Calculation:
   \[
   25 - 21 = 4
   \]
   After selling, Roger has 4 books left.

3. **Money earned from selling:**
   Let's assume that the books sold were sold for $x per book. Therefore, the total money earned from selling 21 books is:
   \[
   21 \times x
   \]

4. **Using the money to buy new books:**
   Roger uses the money earned from selling his books to buy 30 new books at the same price per book (let's call it $y).
   
   Calculation:
   \[
   30 \times y = 21x

   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   y = \frac{21x}{30} = \frac{x}{2}

   So, each book costs him $\frac{x}{2}$ dollars.

5. **Final number of books:**
   After spending on the 30 new books, Roger has 4 books left from selling and also has 30 new books purchased.
   
   Calculation:

                     Nancy had 80 files on her computer. She deleted 31 of them and put the rest into folders with 7 files in each one. How many folders did Nancy end up with? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of files left after deleting some:**
   - Nancy started with 80 files.
   - She deleted 31 files.
   - Therefore, the number of remaining files is \( 80 - 31 = 49 \).

2. **Determine how many folders can be filled with 7 files each using the remaining files:**
   - We divide the total number of remaining files (49) by the number of files per folder (7).
   - So, \( 49 \div 7 = 7 \).

Therefore, Nancy ended up with **7** folders.

{The final answer is} 7 folders.<|im_end|>",7,7.0,7.0

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pictures Isabel put into each of the five different albums.

Step 1: Determine the total number of pictures.
Isabel uploaded 25 pictures to Facebook.

Step 2: Subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures.
There are 10 pictures in the first album.
So, the remaining number of pictures is \( 25 - 10 = 15 \).

Step 3: Divide the remaining pictures equally among the five albums.
We have 15 pictures left after placing them in the first album, and we want to distribute these pictures evenly across five albums.
So, divide 15 by 5 to find out how many pictures go into each album: \( 15 \div 5 = 3 \).

Therefore, there are 3 pictures in each of the five different albums.

So far, Mike has earned a total of $40.

Step 3: Determine how much money Mike spends per week.
Mike spends $5 per week.

Step 4: Calculate how many weeks the money will last.
To find out how many weeks the money will last, divide the total amount of money by the weekly spending amount:
\[ \text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{\$40}{\$5} \]

Step 5: Perform the division.
\[ \frac{\$40}{\$5} = 8 \]

Therefore, the money will last Mike for **8 weeks**.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of books Victor bought and then subtract the number of used books to find out how many new books he bought.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of books Victor bought.
Victor bought 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books. To find the total number of books, we add these two quantities together:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = 32 + 37 \]

Let's perform the addition:

\[ 32 + 37 = 69 \]

So, Victor bought a total of 69 books.

Step 2: Determine how many books were not used.
We know that 16 of the books were used. Therefore, the number of books that were not used (i.e., new books) can be found by subtracting the number of used books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of new books} = \text{Total number of books} - \text{Number of used books} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Number of new books} = 69 - 16 \]

Perform the subtraction:

\[ 69 - 16 = 53 \]

Therefore, Victor bought 53 new books.

                     There were 4 friends playing a video game online when 5 more players joined the game. If each player had 3 lives, how many lives did they have total? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of players**: There were initially 4 friends playing the game.
2. **Players joining the game**: 5 more players joined the game.
3. **Total number of players after joining**: We need to add the initial number of players (4) to the number of players who joined (5). So, \(4 + 5 = 9\) players in total.

Now that we know there are 9 players in total, we can proceed to calculate their total number of lives.

**Step 2: Calculate how many 2-dollar toys Kaleb can buy with his remaining money.**
- Each toy costs $2.
- We need to find out how many such toys he can afford with $4.

Number of toys = Money remaining / Cost per toy
Number of toys = $4 / $2 = 2

Therefore, Kaleb can buy 2 toys for $2 each with his remaining $4.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 2. Kaleb can buy 2 toys for $2 each with the money he has left.<|im_end|>",2,2.0,2.0

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total amount of paper recycled**
Gwen recycled 5 pounds and her friends recycled 13 pounds.

                     Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair. He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth and decided to use the rest on rides. If each ride cost 4 tickets, how many rides could he go on? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how many rides Tom can go on, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of tickets Tom has left after buying some for the 'dunk a clown' booth:**
   - Tom started with 40 tickets.
   - He spent 28 tickets on the 'dunk a clown' booth.

   Subtract the tickets used from the initial amount:
   \[
   40 - 28 = 12
   \]

   So, Tom has 12 tickets remaining that he can spend on rides.

2. **Determine how many rides Tom can take if each ride costs 4 tickets:**
   - Each ride costs 4 tickets.
   - Tom has 12 tickets available for rides.

   Divide the number of remaining tickets by the cost per ride:
   \[
   \frac{12}{4} = 3
   \]

   Therefore, Tom can go on 3 rides.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many pieces of clothing are left after placing some in one load.
Roger initially has 120 pieces of clothing. He puts 48 pieces in one load. To find out how many pieces are left, we subtract the number of pieces already placed from the total number of pieces:

\[ \text{Remaining pieces} = 120 - 48 \]

Performing the subtraction:

\[ 120 - 48 = 72 \]

So, there are 72 pieces of clothing left that need to be divided into smaller loads.

### Step 2: Divide the remaining pieces of clothing into 9 equal loads.
Now that we know there are 72 pieces of clothing left, we need to divide these equally among 9 loads. We do this by dividing 72 by 9:

\[ \frac{72}{9} \]

Performing the division:

\[ \frac{72}{9} = 8 \]

So, each of the small loads will contain 8 pieces of clothing.

### Final Answer:

A librarian takes 2 books from this group.
So, the number of books left for Roger = \( 14 - 2 \).

**Step 2: Calculate the number of shelves needed**
Roger can fit 3 books on one shelf.

We now calculate the number of shelves required by dividing the remaining books by the capacity per shelf.

\[ \text{Number of shelves} = \frac{\text{Remaining books}}{\text{Books per shelf}} \]

Let's do the calculations:

- Remaining books after taking 2 out of 14: \( 14 - 2 = 12 \)

                     Wendy uploaded 22 pictures from her phone and 2 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 4 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of pictures uploaded:**
   - Wendy uploaded 22 pictures from her phone.
   - She also uploaded 2 pictures from her camera.
   
   Total number of pictures = 22 (from phone) + 2 (from camera) = 24 pictures.

2. **Determine how many pictures go into each album:**
   - The total number of pictures is 24.
   - These pictures need to be divided equally into 4 albums.
   
   Number of pictures per album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums
   
3. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
   \]

Therefore, there will be **6 pictures** in each of the albums.<|im_end|>",6,6.0,6.0

                     A pet store had 13 puppies. In one day they sold 7 of them and put the rest into cages with 2 in each cage. How many cages did they use? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many cages were used, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of puppies**: The pet store starts with 13 puppies.

2. **Puppies sold**: They sold 7 puppies during that day.

3. **Remaining puppies**: To find out how many puppies are left after selling some, we subtract the number of puppies sold from the initial number of puppies.
   \[
   13 - 7 = 6
   \]
   So, there are 6 puppies remaining.

4. **Number of puppies per cage**: Each cage holds 2 puppies.

5. **Cages needed for remaining puppies**: To find out how many cages are required to hold the remaining 6 puppies, we divide the total number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage.
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]

Therefore, the pet store used 3 cages to hold the remaining puppies.

**Final Answer:**

To determine how many bouquets Isabel can still make after some flowers wilted, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of flowers available.
Isabel initially picked 66 flowers.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of flowers that wilted.
It's given that 10 flowers wilted.

### Step 3: Subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers.
\[ \text{Number of remaining flowers} = 66 - 10 \]

\[

2. **Calculate the cost for Frank's friend's purchases:**
   - Frank's friend buys 2 decks.
   - Each deck costs $7.

\[
\text{Cost for Friend} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

3. **Add both amounts together to find the total expenditure:**

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Frank's Cost} + \text{Friend's Cost} = 21 + 14 = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount Frank and his friend spent on the trick decks is \( \boxed{35} \).<|im_end|>",35,35.0,35.0

                    question:
                     Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? 
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how many shirts Sam did not wash, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of shirts Sam needed to wash.
2. Subtract the number of shirts he actually washed from the total number of shirts.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of shirts Sam needed to wash.
Sam has 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts. So, the total number of shirts is:
\[ 40 + 23 = 63 \]

Step 2: Subtract the number of shirts he actually washed from the total number of shirts.
Sam washed 29 shirts. Therefore, the number of shirts he did not wash is:
\[ 63 - 29 = 34 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{34}

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                     A waiter had 47 customers to wait on. If 41 customers left and he got another 20 customers, how many customers would he have?

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Start with the initial number of customers.
The waiter initially has 47 customers.

Step 2: Subtract the number of customers who left.
Since 41 customers left, we subtract that from the initial count.
\[ 47 - 41 = 6 \]

Step 3: Add the new customers who arrived.
After some time, 20 more customers arrive, so we add those to the remaining count.
\[ 6 + 20 = 26 \]

Therefore, after accounting for the departures and arrivals, the waiter would have 26 customers. 

{The final answer is} The final answer is 26 customers.<|im_end|>",26,26.0,26.0
