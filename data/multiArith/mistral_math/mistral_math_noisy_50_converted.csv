                [/INST] Sure, I'll break this down step by step.

1. Initial number of apples = 23
2. Apples used to make lunch = 20
3. Apples left after making lunch = Initial number of apples - Apples used = 23 - 20 = 3
4. New number of apples after buying more = Apples left + More apples bought = 3 + 6 = 9

So, after buying more apples, the cafeteria would have 9 apples left.

1. In the video game, each enemy defeated gives you 9 points.
2. You are in a level with a total of 11 enemies.
3. You defeat all but 3 of them, which means you defeated 11 - 3 = 8 enemies.

                [/INST] Sure, I can help with that. We're given that Megan earns 8 points for each bag of cans she recycles, and she had 14 bags. However, she didn't recycle 5 of them.

So, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to find out how many bags Megan actually recycled. She had 14 bags and didn't recycle 5, so that leaves us with:

   Bags recycled = Total bags - Bags not recycled
   = 14 - 5
   = 9 bags

2. Next, we calculate the points Megan would have earned for recycling these 9 bags. We know she earns 8 points per bag, so:

   Points earned = Points per bag * Bags recycled
   = 8 * 9
   = 72 points

Therefore, Megan would have earned 72 points for recycling 9 bags of cans.

1. First, we need to understand the number of roses April sold. She started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left. So, the number of roses sold is:
   \[
   13 - 4 = 9 \text{ roses sold}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the total amount of money April earned from selling the roses. Each rose was sold for $4. So, the total earnings from selling 9 roses is:
   \[
   4 \times 9 = \$36

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to find out how many people actually attended the luncheon. We know that 47 people were invited and 7 didn't show up. So, the number of people who attended is:

Attendees = Invited - Did not show up
= 47 - 7
= 40

2. Next, we need to find out how many tables are needed if each table holds 5 people. To do this, we divide the number of attendees by the number of seats at each table:

Tables needed = Attendees / Seats per table
= 40 / 5
= 8

So, they need 8 tables for the luncheon.

Final answer: They need 8 tables.</s>",8,8.0,8.0

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. Tom starts with 5 books.
2. He sells 4/5 of them. So, the number of books he sells is 4/5 * 5 = 4 books.
3. This leaves him with 1 book (5 - 4 = 1).
4. He uses the money to buy 38 new books.
5. However, the number of new books he can buy should not exceed the number of books he sold, which was 4. So, he can only buy 4 books.
6. Therefore, the total number of books Tom has now is 1 (the one he didn't sell) + 4 (the new books he bought) = 5 books.

So, the final answer is {Tom would have 5 books}.</s>",39,39.0,5.0

                [/INST] To determine how many shelves Jerry would fill in his fridge, we first need to find the total number of sodas Jerry bought. He bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas, which gives us a total of:

\[41 + 22 = 63 \text{ sodas}\]

Given that Jerry's fridge holds 9 sodas on each shelf, we can find out how many shelves he would fill by dividing the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold:

\[63 \div 9 = 7 \text{ shelves}\]

Therefore, Jerry would fill up \(\boxed{7}\) shelves in his fridge.</s>",7,7.0,7.0

                [/INST] Debby and her sister combined their candy for Halloween. Debby had 32 pieces and her sister had 42. To find out the total amount of candy they had, we need to add these two amounts together.

So, the total amount of candy is:

\[32 + 42 = 74\]

This means they had 74 pieces of candy in total.

After eating 35 pieces on the first night, we need to find out how many pieces they have left. To do this, we subtract the amount they ate from the total amount they had.

So, the number of pieces of candy they have left is:

\[74 - 35 = 39\]

Therefore, Debby and her sister have 39 pieces of candy left.

                [/INST] Let's reason through this problem step by step:

1. Emily started with 41 seeds.

2. She planted 29 seeds in her big garden.

3. This means she had 41 - 29 = 12 seeds left.

4. She planted 4 seeds in each of her small gardens.

5. To find out how many small gardens she had, we divide the remaining seeds by the number of seeds per small garden. So, 12 seeds divided by 4 seeds per garden equals 3 small gardens.

The final answer is {Emily had 3 small gardens}.</s>",3,3.0,3.0

                [/INST] The total amount of candy Emily has is the sum of the candy she received from her neighbors and her sister. So, she has a total of 5 pieces from neighbors and 13 pieces from her sister, which is 5 + 13 = 18 pieces of candy.

If Emily eats 9 pieces of candy each day, the number of days the candy will last her is the total amount of candy divided by the number of pieces she eats each day. So, 18 pieces of candy divided by 9 pieces of candy per day equals 2 days.

Therefore, the candy will last Emily 2 days. {The final answer is 2 days}.</s>",2,2.0,2.0

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 82 books in total.

2. The librarian takes 1/10 of the books, which is 82 books * 1/10 = 8.2 books. However, since we can't have a fraction of a book, we need to round this number. If we round down, the librarian takes 8 books, but if we round up, the librarian takes 8 books and a part of another book, which means 8 full books and some unaccounted books. Since the next shelf would need to fit the entire remaining book, we'll assume the librarian takes 8 books.

3. After the librarian takes the 8 books, Mike is left with 82 - 8 = 74 books.

4. Mike can fit 9 books on a shelf.

5. To find out how many shelves Mike needs, we divide the total number of books he is responsible for by the number of books each shelf can hold: 74 books / 9 books per shelf = 8.22 shelves.

6. Since Mike can't use a fraction of a shelf, he'll need to round up. Therefore, Mike needs 9 shelves.

1. The builder has already installed 8 windows. There are 14 windows in total.
2. So, there are 14 - 8 = 6 windows left to install.
3. It takes 8 hours to install each window.

1. Start with the initial number of oranges in the bin, which is 40.

2. Subtract the number of old oranges thrown away. In this case, 25 oranges are thrown away.

3. Add the new oranges that are put into the bin. Here, 21 new oranges are added.

Putting it all together in a mathematical expression:

\[40 - 25 + 21\]

Now, let's calculate this step by step:

First, subtract the old oranges thrown away:

\[40 - 25 = 15\]

Then, add the new oranges:

\[15 + 21 = 36\]

Therefore, after throwing away 25 of the old oranges and adding 21 new ones, there will be 36 oranges in the bin.

                [/INST] The problem asks for the time it will take to install the remaining windows, given that 6 of them have already been installed and the building requires a total of 9 windows.

First, let's find out how many windows are left to install:
Number of remaining windows = Total windows - Installed windows
Number of remaining windows = 9 - 6
Number of remaining windows = 3

Next, we know that it takes 6 hours to install each window. So, to find out how long it will take to install the remaining 3 windows, we multiply the number of windows by the time it takes to install each one:
Time to install remaining windows = Number of remaining windows * Time per window
Time to install remaining windows = 3 * 6 hours
Time to install remaining windows = 18 hours

So, it will take 18 hours to install the rest of the windows.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into several steps:

1. Frank won 33 tickets from 'whack a mole' and 9 tickets from 'skee ball'. So, the total number of tickets Frank won is:

Total tickets = Tickets from 'whack a mole' + Tickets from 'skee ball'
                        = 33 + 9
                        = 42 tickets

2. Frank wants to buy candy that costs 6 tickets each. So, to find out how many candies Frank can buy, we need to divide the total number of tickets he won by the cost of one candy:

Number of candies = Total tickets / Cost of one candy
                             = 42 / 6

1. We know that each adult meal costs $7.
2. Among the 13 people in the group, 9 are kids. This means that the remaining people are adults. So, 13 - 9 = 4 adults.
3. Since only adults need to pay for their meals and each adult meal costs $7, the total cost for the meal would be the number of adults multiplied by the cost per adult meal. So, 4 adults * $7/adult = $28.

                [/INST] Here's how you can reason through this problem:

1. We know that Paige started with 43 math problems and 12 science problems. So, the total number of problems she had at the start can be calculated as follows: TotalProblems = MathProblems + ScienceProblems. That is, TotalProblems = 43 + 12.

2. The total number of problems she started with is therefore 55.

3. We are told that she finished 44 problems at school. So, to find out how many problems she still has to do at home, we subtract the number of problems she finished from the total number of problems she started with. That is, RemainingProblems = TotalProblems - FinishedProblems.

4. Substituting the values we have, we get RemainingProblems = 55 - 44.

3. To calculate the score from the first level, we multiply the number of treasures by the points per treasure: 0.5 * 9 = 4.5 points.
4. She found 2 treasures on the second level.
5. To calculate the score from the second level, we multiply the number of treasures by the points per treasure: 2 * 9 = 18 points.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Wendy initially picked 103 flowers.
2. She was planning to make bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. So, the total number of bouquets she could make with 103 flowers would be 103 / 8.
3. However, 47 of the flowers wilted, so the number of viable flowers left is 103 - 47 = 56 flowers.
4. With 56 flowers, the number of bouquets Wendy could make now is 56 / 8.

Let's calculate:

56 / 8 = 7

So, Wendy could still make 7 bouquets.

                [/INST] To determine the number of vans needed, we first need to find the total number of people going on the trip:

Total people = Nancy's class members + Adults
= 12 students + 3 adults
= 15 people

Next, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each van can hold, then round up to the nearest whole number since even if there's room for more people in a van, they still need a separate vehicle.

Number of vans needed = Total people / People per van
= 15 people / 5 people per van
= 3 vans

However, there might be additional considerations such as load-carrying capacity or vehicle constraints that we don't have information about in this problem. So, it's important to consider all relevant factors before finalizing a solution.

Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. So, the total number of sodas is:
4 (regular sodas) + 52 (diet sodas) = 56 sodas

Step 2: Determine how many shelves Tom would fill up.
Since each shelf can hold 7 sodas, we can find out how many shelves Tom would fill up by dividing the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold:
56 (total sodas) ÷ 7 (sodas per shelf) = 8 shelves

1. First, we need to understand that the problem mentions an amount Frank had saved up, but that amount is not provided in the question. So, we cannot calculate the exact amount Frank has.

2. Frank receives another $37 for his allowance.

3. The problem also mentions a unit price for toys, but again, the price is not provided.

4. So, we cannot calculate the exact number of $0.8 toys Frank can buy, as we do not know the total amount he has nor the price of the toys.

Therefore, without the missing information, it is impossible to calculate the exact number of $0.8 toys Frank could buy. The problem lacks a crucial piece of information: the amount Frank had saved up.

1. Vanessa picked 17 carrots.
2. Her mother picked 14 carrots.
3. Only 24 carrots were good.

Assuming that ""good"" refers to the number of carrots that were harvested without any damages, we can deduce the following steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of carrots picked by Vanessa and her mother.
Total carrots = Vanessa's carrots + Mother's carrots = 17 + 14 = 31 carrots

Step 2: Subtract the number of good carrots from the total carrots to determine the number of bad carrots.
Bad carrots = Total carrots - Good carrots = 31 - 24 = 7 carrots

Therefore, the number of bad carrots they had is {The final answer is 7}. However, this answer assumes that the missing words in the sentence do not significantly change the given information.</s>",7,7.0,7.0

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to find out the total number of people at the picnic and then divide that number by the number of teams to find out how many people would be on each team.

Step 1: Determine the total number of people
The problem states that there are 23 managers and 7 employees. So, the total number of people is the sum of managers and employees.
Total number of people = Number of managers + Number of employees
= 23 + 7
= 30

Step 2: Determine the number of people on each team
The problem states that they split into 6 teams. So, the number of people on each team is the total number of people divided by the number of teams.
Number of people on each team = Total number of people / Number of teams
= 30 / 6

Number of brownies still needed = Total brownies - Brownies already baked
= 17 - 8
= 9

1. Tiffany uses 8 cups of flour for each brownie.
2. She already used 8 cups of flour for the 8 brownies she has already baked.

The phrase ""only 38 ! of ; the ; carrots were good"" is also unclear. The symbol ""!"" and the word ""of"" could be a typo or unnecessary. I'm assuming this phrase means ""38% of the carrots they picked were good.""

If only 38% of the carrots they picked were good, then 62% of the carrots they picked were bad (since 100% - 38% = 62%).

First, let's find out the total number of carrots they picked:

Total carrots picked = Carol's carrots + Mom's carrots
Total carrots picked = 32 + 16
Total carrots picked = 48

Now, let's find out how many of those were bad:

Bad carrots = Total carrots * Percentage of bad carrots
Bad carrots = 48 * 62%
Bad carrots = 48 * 0.62 (since 62% = 0.62)
Bad carrots = 29.76

Since we can't have a fraction of a carrot, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. So, the number of bad carrots is 30.

8 * 6 = 48 lives

Next, we need to add the additional lives that came when 2 more players joined the game.

Since each new player also has 6 lives, we multiply the number of new players (2) by the number of lives (6):

2 * 6 = 12 lives

Now, we add these new lives to the initial total:

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. Roger initially had 25 books.
2. He sold 21 of them. So, he has now 25 - 21 = 4 books left.
3. He used the money he earned to buy 30 new books.
4. However, this seems to be a misunderstanding in the question. If he sold 21 books, he would have got money and then used this money to buy 30 new books. But it seems the question is indicating that the 21 books he sold were used to buy the new 30 books. This is not possible because selling books to buy the same number of books you just traded would mean you didn't actually sell anything.

If we correct this and assume the earnings from the 21 books sold were used to buy new books, then:

5. He would have 4 original books left (since he sold 21 of the 25 and still has 4 left).
6. He bought 30 new books.
7. So, he would have 4 (original books) + 30 (new books) = 34 books in total.

Therefore, the final answer is Roger would have 34 books.</s>",34,34.0,34.0

                [/INST] First, let's find out how much money Frank spent and how much money he had left.

Frank initially made $19 from mowing lawns.

He then spent $11 on buying new mower blades.

So, the money Frank had left is 19 - 11 = $8.

Now, let's consider the cost of the games Frank wants to buy. Each game costs $2.

To find out how many games Frank can buy, we divide the money he has left by the cost of each game.

So, the number of games Frank can buy is 8 / 2 = 4 games.

1. First, we need to find out how many students were picked for the team. Since 17 didn't get picked, we subtract this number from the total number of students trying out.
   Total students trying out - Students not picked = Students picked
   65 - 17 = 48

2. Next, we need to divide the number of students picked by the number of groups to find out how many students would be in each group.

1. First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Mike made. He made $14 from mowing lawns and $26 from weed eating. So, the total amount is $14 + $26 = $40.

2. Next, we need to determine how long this money would last given his weekly spending. Mike spends $5 a week. So, the total number of weeks (or how long the money would last) is the total amount of money divided by his weekly spending.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of files Vanessa had on her flash drive before deleting any. She had 16 music files and 48 video files, which gives us a total of:
\[16 + 48 = 64 \text{ files}\]

Next, we need to find out how many files she deleted. Vanessa deleted 30% of her files. To calculate the number of files deleted, we find 30% of the total number of files:
\[64 \times 0.30 = 19.2\]

Since the number of files deleted cannot be a fraction, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Vanessa deleted 19 files.

Finally, to find out how many files are still on her flash drive after deleting 19 files, we subtract the number of files deleted from the total number of files:
\[64 - 19 = 45 \text{ files}\]

Therefore, the number of files still on her flash drive is $\boxed{45}$.</s>",34,34.0,45.0

\[2 + 34 = 36\]

Given that 4 puppies are adopted each day, we can find out how many days it would take for all 36 puppies to be adopted by dividing the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day:

1. Will had 59 pieces of clothing to wash.
2. He put 32 pieces in one load.
3. He decided to split the remaining pieces into 9 equal loads.

Now, let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the number of pieces left after the first load:
   Remaining pieces = Total pieces - Loaded pieces
   = 59 - 32
   = 27 pieces

2. Now, we need to find out how many pieces of clothing can go in each of the small loads. Since he wants to split the remaining pieces into 9 equal loads, we divide the remaining pieces by 9:
   Pieces in each small load = Remaining pieces / Number of small loads
   = 27 / 9

So, each of the small loads can contain 3 pieces of clothing.

                [/INST] The problem states that Isabel had two pages of math homework and four pages of reading homework, and each page had 5 problems on it. To find the total number of problems she had to complete, we need to add the total number of problems from both types of homework.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of problems for math homework.
Math problems = Number of math pages * Number of problems per page
= 2 pages * 5 problems/page
= 10 problems

Step 2: Calculate the total number of problems for reading homework.
Reading problems = Number of reading pages * Number of problems per page
= 4 pages * 5 problems/page
= 20 problems

Step 3: Add the total number of problems from both types of homework to find the total number of problems Isabel had to complete.
Total problems = Math problems + Reading problems
= 10 problems + 20 problems
= 30 problems

So, the final answer is {30}.</s>",30,30.0,30.0

1. We start with 4 friends playing a video game online.

2. Then, 5 more players join the game. So, the total number of players becomes 4 (original players) + 5 (new players) = 9 players.

3. Each player has 3 lives.

4. To find out the total number of lives, we multiply the total number of players by the number of lives each player has. That is, 9 (total players) * 3 (lives) = 27 lives.

So, the total number of lives they have is 27.

1. Kaleb had $12 initially.
2. He spent $8 on a new game.
3. This means he has $12 - $8 = $4 left.
4. Now, we need to find out how many $2 toys he can buy with the $4 he has left.
5. To do this, we divide the remaining money by the cost of each toy.
6. So, we divide $4 by $2.
7. Therefore, he can buy 4 / 2 = 2 toys.

First, let's identify the number of tickets Haley bought:
1. She bought 3 tickets for herself.
2. She bought tickets for ""? her ? friends"". Since the question uses the same symbol (""?"") for the unknown number of friends as it does for the unknown number in the phrase ""5 extra tickets"", it suggests that the number of friends is also unknown and represented by ""?"". Let's denote the number of friends as F.
3. She bought 5 extra tickets.

So, the total number of tickets Haley bought is 3 (for herself) + F (for friends) + 5 (extra) = F + 8.

Next, let's calculate the cost:
The cost per ticket is $4. So, the total cost would be (F + 8) * $4.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 4 bird cages in the pet store.
2. Each cage has 1! 8 . parrots and ; 2 parakeets in it. (Assuming ""! 8"" is a typo and should be ""8"", so each cage has 8 parrots and 2 parakeets).
3. We need to find the total number of birds in the pet store.

First, let's calculate the number of birds in one cage:

Number of parrots in one cage = 8
Number of parakeets in one cage = 2

Total number of birds in one cage = 8 (parrots) + 2 (parakeets) = 10 birds

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds in all 4 cages:

Total number of birds in the pet store = Number of cages * Total number of birds in one cage

Total number of birds in the pet store = 4 * 10 = 40 birds

Final answer: The total number of birds in the pet store is $40 birds.</s>",40,40.0,40.0

3. Kaleb gave 5 pieces of candy to his little brother.
4. To find out how many pieces Kaleb still has, we subtract the number of pieces he gave away from the total number of pieces he bought. So, Kaleb still has 84 pieces - 5 pieces = 79 pieces.

1. First, we need to find out the total number of pictures Robin uploaded to Facebook. She uploaded 31 pictures from her phone and 5 from her camera, so the total number of pictures is 31 + 5 = 36 pictures.

2. Next, we know that these 36 pictures were sorted into 9 different albums with the same amount of pictures in each album. To find out how many pictures were in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. So, 36 pictures divided by 9 albums equals 4 pictures per album.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. First, we need to calculate how much money Mike had left after buying the new mower blades.
2. To do that, we subtract the amount he spent on the blades from the total amount he made over the summer: $69 - $24 = $45.
3. Now, we need to find out how many $5 games he could buy with the $45 he has left.
4. To do that, we divide the amount he has left by the cost of one game: $45 / $5 = 9 games.

                [/INST] Maria bought 2 chairs and 2 tables. It took her 8 minutes to assemble each piece of furniture.

To find out the total time she spent assembling, we first need to calculate the time it took to assemble all the chairs and tables together.

Since she bought 2 chairs and each took 8 minutes to assemble, it took 2 * 8 = 16 minutes to assemble all the chairs.

Similarly, since she bought 2 tables and each took 8 minutes to assemble, it took 2 * 8 = 16 minutes to assemble all the tables.

Now, to find the total time she spent assembling, we add the time it took to assemble all the chairs and all the tables together:

16 (minutes for chairs) + 16 (minutes for tables) = 32 minutes

So, it took Maria 32 minutes to finish assembling all the furniture.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to determine how many baggies Maria can make with her cookies, given that each baggie contains 8 cookies. She has 15 chocolate chip cookies and 19 oatmeal cookies, making a total of 15 + 19 = 34 cookies.

Now, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per baggie to find out how many baggies she can make:

Number of baggies = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies per baggie
                 = 34 / 8
                 = 4.25

Since Maria can't make a fraction of a baggie, she can only make 4 full baggies of cookies.

                [/INST] The question seems to be missing some information, such as the number of flowers April's Flower Sale was having a sale on or the number of blooms the flowers have. However, let's assume we can still provide an answer by completing the given context:

Let's denote the number of flowers sold for the sale as F. We are told that Zoe bought 8 roses and 2 daisies. Assuming she bought these in the quantities of 3 each:

Zoe bought 8 roses, so that's 8/3 = 2.67 purchases, which means she bought 2 full sets and part of another set (most likely 2 roses of the 3 in the set).

She also bought 2 daisies, so that's 2/3 = 0.67 purchases, which means she bought part of a set (most likely 2 daisies of the 3 in the set).

Therefore, we assume the total flowers bought by Zoe is 2 roses + 2 daisies = 4 flowers.

Each flower costs 3 dollars as per the sale. So, the total cost for Zoe is:

4 flowers * $3 per flower = $12.

1. We know that Bianca has 5 shelves of mystery books and each shelf has exactly 8 books on it. So, the total number of mystery books is:
   Mystery books = Number of mystery books shelves * Books per shelf
   = 5 * 8
   = 40

2. Similarly, she has 4 shelves of picture books and each shelf has exactly 8 books on it. So, the total number of picture books is:
   Picture books = Number of picture books shelves * Books per shelf

Now, if she uses 5 cups of flour for each brownie, we can calculate how much flour she needs for the remaining brownies:

- In the first line, the symbol "";"" seems to be separating two pieces of information.
- The symbol "":"" seems to be relating two pieces of information.
- The symbol ""?"" indicates a question that we need to find an answer for.

So, the problem can be rephrased as:

Paul was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday, he filled 6 bags up, and on Sunday he filled 3 more bags. Each bag had 8 cans in it. How many cans did he pick up in total?

To find the total number of cans Paul collected, we need to add the number of cans in the bags he filled on Saturday and the number of cans in the bags he filled on Sunday.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cans Paul collected on Saturday.
Number of cans on Saturday = Number of bags * Number of cans per bag
= 6 * 8

Step 2: Calculate the number of cans Paul collected on Sunday.
Number of cans on Sunday = Number of bags * Number of cans per bag

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cans Paul collected.
Total number of cans = Number of cans on Saturday + Number of cans on Sunday

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we start by figuring out the total number of chicken wings that were available for the group of friends. The chef initially had 8 chicken wings and cooked 10 more, making the total number of chicken wings:
\[8 + 10 = 18\]

Given that there are 3 friends, and they are to receive an equal share of the chicken wings, we divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends to find out how many each person gets:
\[18 \div 3 = 6\]

Therefore, each person would get 6 chicken wings. Encapsulating the final answer, we have:

First, we add the number of new players and returning players:
2 (new players) + 6 (returning players) = 8 (total players)

Next, we divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group:
8 (total players) ÷ 4 (players per group) = 2 (groups)

Rooms left = Total rooms - Rooms already painted
= 6 - 2
= 4

Next, we need to calculate the time it would take to paint these remaining rooms. We know each room takes 5 hours to paint, so we multiply the number of remaining rooms by the time it takes to paint one room.

Time to paint remaining rooms = Rooms left * Time per room
= 4 * 5
= 20

So, the painter will take 20 more hours to paint the rest of the rooms.

Shirts washed = Total shirts * Fraction washed
Shirts washed = 36 * 20/100
Shirts washed = 72/100 * 36
Shirts washed = 7.2 * 36

                [/INST] First, let's identify the information given in the problem. April is having a sale where each flower costs $8. Vanessa bought 3 roses and 3 daisies.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the roses. Since each rose costs $8 and Vanessa bought 3 roses, the cost of the roses is 3 (number of roses) * $8 (cost per rose) = $24.

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the daisies. Since each daisy also costs $8 and Vanessa bought 3 daisies, the cost of the daisies is 3 (number of daisies) * $8 (cost per daisy) = $24.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount Vanessa spent. She spent $24 on roses and $24 on daisies, so her total cost is $24 (cost of roses) + $24 (cost of daisies) = $48.

Therefore, \boxed{48} is the amount Vanessa spent.</s>",48,48.0,48.0

                [/INST] There seems to be a typo in the problem. Please provide the complete and correct problem statement to proceed with the solution.

Assuming you meant: ""Jerry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 8 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 9 trays from one table, and 7 trays from another, how many trips will he make?""

Jerry can only carry 8 trays at a time, so he initially picked up 8 trays. Then he had to pick up an additional 9 trays and 7 trays. The total number of trays is now 8 + 9 + 7 = 24 trays.

For the 24 trays, since Jerry can make trips with 8 trays at a time, we divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry per trip.

24 trays ÷ 8 trays/trip = 3 trips with 8 trays and 4 trays remaining.

Finally, Jerry will make one more trip to pick up the remaining 4 trays.

Therefore, Jerry will make a total of 3 + 1 = 4 trips.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sam filled 3 bags on Saturday with 9 cans in each bag. So, the number of cans he picked up on Saturday is 3 bags * 9 cans/bag = 27 cans.

2. On Sunday, he filled 4 more bags. We don't know if these bags also had 9 cans each, so let's represent the number of cans in these bags as ""x"". So, the number of cans he picked up on Sunday is 4x.

3. The total number of cans Sam picked up is the sum of the cans he picked up on Saturday and Sunday. So, the total number of cans is 27 cans (from Saturday) + 4x cans (from Sunday).

4. However, the question states that Sam filled 4 more ""?"" bags. Since we don't know if these bags had 9 cans each, and the number after ""?"" is 9, it's reasonable to assume that each of these 4 bags also had 9 cans. So, x = 9 cans.

                [/INST] Certainly, let's break this down:

1. Luke started with 57 games. He sold 39 of them. So, the number of games left is 57 - 39 = 18 games.

2. He packed up the remaining games by putting 2 games into each box. Therefore, the number of boxes he needed is the number of remaining games divided by the number of games per box. So, the number of boxes is 18 games / 2 games per box = 9 boxes.

Therefore, Luke had {9} boxes to use.</s>",9,9.0,9.0

                [/INST] The problem presents Emily, who bought 2 roses and 2 daisies during a sale where each flower was discounted to $3. Since Emily bought 4 flowers in total (2 roses and 2 daisies), we can calculate the total cost of her purchase by multiplying the number of flowers by the price per flower.

1. The price per flower is $3.
2. Emily bought 4 flowers (2 roses + 2 daisies).

Out of these 28 carrots, only 12 were good. So, the remaining carrots must be bad.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of flowers Isabel had before the wilting occurred. She picked 66 flowers.

Isabel was planning to make bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. To find out how many bouquets she could make before the wilting, we divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet:

66 flowers ÷ 8 flowers/bouquet = 8 bouquets

However, 10 of the flowers wilted before the wedding. This means the total number of flowers she has to work with is now 66 - 10 = 56 flowers.

To find out how many bouquets she can still make, we divide the new total number of flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet:

56 flowers ÷ 8 flowers/bouquet = 7 bouquets with 2 flowers left over

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many times Oliver rode the ferris wheel. From the sentence, it seems like the ferris wheel ride was repeated 5 times, so we have 5 rides.

2. Next, we need to find out how many times Oliver rode the bumper cars. The sentence indicates that the bumper cars ride was repeated 4 times, so we have 4 rides.

3. Now, we need to calculate the total number of times Oliver rode the two rides. That would be 5 (ferris wheel rides) + 4 (bumper cars rides) = 9 rides in total.

4. The cost of each ride is 7 tickets. So, if Oliver rode a total of 9 times, the total number of tickets he used would be 9 (rides) * 7 (tickets per ride) = 63 tickets.

2. She spent 6? minutes on each piece of furniture. So, the total time spent is 8 (pieces of furniture) * 6 (minutes per piece) = 48 minutes.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of winter clothing Zoe has. This includes both scarves and mittens.

First, let's calculate the total number of scarves Zoe has:

Number of scarves per box = 4
Number of boxes = 8

So, total number of scarves = Number of scarves per box * Number of boxes
= 4 * 8
= 32

Next, let's calculate the total number of mittens Zoe has:

Number of mittens per box = 6
Number of boxes = 8

So, total number of mittens = Number of mittens per box * Number of boxes
= 6 * 8
= 48

Now, to find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we add the total number of scarves and the total number of mittens:

Total number of pieces = Total number of scarves + Total number of mittens

= 80

So, Zoe has a total of 80 pieces of winter clothing.
