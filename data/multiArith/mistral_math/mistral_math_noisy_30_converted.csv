                [/INST] First, let's add the number of girls and boys trying out for the team:

39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students

Then, we know that 26 students got called back, so to find out how many students didn't make the cut, we subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out:

43 students - 26 students = 17 students

So, the final answer is: {There were 17 students who didn't make the cut}.</s>",17,17.0,17.0

                [/INST] April sold the roses at a discount, with each rose costing $4. She started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left.

First, we need to find out how many roses April sold. Since she had 13 roses initially and 4 roses left, she must have sold:

13 (total roses) - 4 (roses left) = 9 roses

Next, we need to calculate how much money she earned from selling these 9 roses. Each rose was sold for $4, so the total amount of money she earned is:

9 roses * $4/rose = $36

So, the final answer is:

                    question:
                     Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 : long sleeve shirts , before ! school. . If he had only washed ! 29 of them by the time school ; started, how many did he not wash? 
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of shirts Ned had to wash and then subtract the number of shirts he washed by the time school started.

The total number of shirts Ned had to wash is the sum of the short sleeve shirts and the long sleeve shirts, which is 9 + 21 = 30 shirts.

Ned washed 29 shirts by the time school started. The number of shirts he did not wash is therefore the total number of shirts minus the number he washed, which is 30 - 29 = 1 shirt.

So, the final answer is that Ned did not wash 1 shirt.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Tom originally had 5 books.
2. He sold 4 books, leaving him with 1 book (5 - 4 = 1).
3. He used the money from the sale to buy 38 new books.

So, to find out how many books Tom would have after buying the new ones, we add the books he didn't sell to the number of new books he bought:

1 (books he didn't sell) + 38 (new books bought) = 39 books

Therefore, Tom would have 39 books.

                [/INST] Here is the solution, broken down into steps:

1. Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas, so in total he bought 41 + 22 = 63 sodas.
2. Each shelf in his fridge can hold 9 sodas.
3. To find out how many shelves he would fill up, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold: 63 / 9.
4. This gives us 7, but since there are no decimal numbers involved here, this means Jerry will exactly fill up 7 shelves, and there will be no sodas left.

                [/INST] To find out how many small gardens Emily had, we need to subtract the number of seeds she planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds she started with, and then divide the result by the number of seeds she put in each of the small gardens.

Here are the steps:

1. Emily started with 41 seeds in total.
2. She planted 29 seeds in the big garden.
3. So, the number of seeds left for the small gardens is 41 - 29 = 12 seeds.
4. Emily put 4 seeds in each small garden.
5. Therefore, the number of small gardens Emily had is 12 / 4 = 3 small gardens.

                    question:
                     For Halloween Emily received 5 pieces of candy from ! neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate ! 9 pieces a ? day, how long would the candy last ? her? 
                [/INST] The problem can be solved by following these steps:

1. First, we need to determine the total amount of candy Emily received. She received 5 pieces from each of her ! neighbors, which we don't know, and 13 pieces from her older sister. So, the total amount of candy in terms of her ! neighbors is:
   Total candy = Candy from neighbors + Candy from sister
   Total candy = (Number of neighbors * 5) + 13

2. Next, we need to determine how long the candy will last if Emily eats ! 9 pieces a day. To do this, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of pieces she eats each day:
   Time candy lasts = Total candy / Pieces eaten per day
   Time candy lasts = [(Number of neighbors * 5) + 13] / 9

3. However, the question does not provide the number of her ! neighbors. In this case, we cannot determine a numerical answer. But if we were to assume that her ! neighbors is a certain number, we would need to plug that value into the equation to find the answer.

For example, if we assume that she has 4 neighbors (! = 4), the calculation would be:
   Total candy = (4 * 5) + 13 = 20 + 13 = 33
   Time candy lasts = 33 / 9 = 3.67 days

So, if Emily has 4 neighbors, the candy would last approximately 3.67 days if she eats 9 pieces a day.

{The final answer is 3.67 days if we assume Emily has 4 neighbors.}</s>",2,2.0,4.0

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many books Mike is left with after the librarian takes 10 of them. So, we subtract 10 from the total number of books, which is 82.
   82 - 10 = 72 books

2. Now, we need to find out how many shelves Mike will need to put away all the books. He can fit 9 books on a shelf. So, we divide the number of books Mike is left with by the number of books that can fit on a shelf.

3. However, since 9 does not divide 72 evenly, there will be some remainder. In other words, the number of shelves needed will be slightly more than 72 divided by 9.

72 / 9 = 8 with a remainder of 0.

So, Mike will need 8 full shelves to put away all the books.

The final answer is, Mike needs {8 shelves}.</s>",8,8.0,8.0

Total pictures taken = Pictures at the zoo + Pictures at the museum
Total pictures taken = 49 + 8
Total pictures taken = 57 pictures

Next, we know that Nancy deleted 38 pictures. To find out how many pictures she has left, we subtract the number of pictures she deleted from the total number of pictures she took.

The building needs 14 windows in total, and the builder has already installed 8 of them. Therefore, the number of windows remaining is:
14 (total windows) - 8 (installed windows) = 6 windows

Step 2: Calculate the time required to install the remaining windows.
It takes 8 hours to install each window, and there are 6 windows remaining. Therefore, the time required to install the rest of the windows is:

1. John earns $8 for each lawn he mows.
2. He was supposed to mow 15 lawns.
3. However, he forgot to mow 7 lawns.
4. Therefore, he actually mowed 15 (total lawns) - 7 (forgotten lawns) = 8 lawns.
5. To find out how much money he earned, we multiply the number of lawns he actually mowed by the amount he earns per lawn: 8 (lawns mowed) * $8 (per lawn) = $64.

So, the final answer is: John actually earned {64} dollars.</s>",64,64.0,64.0

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out the total number of puppies in the shelter. We do this by adding the number of puppies that were initially there (5) to the number of puppies that were brought in (35). This gives us a total of 40 puppies.

2. Next, we need to figure out how many days it would take for all of them to be adopted. We know that 8 puppies are adopted each day.

3. To find out how many days it would take for all 40 puppies to be adopted at a rate of 8 puppies per day, we divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day. In this case, that's 40 divided by 8, which equals 5.

So, it would take 5 days for all 40 puppies to be adopted. Therefore, the final answer is {5 days}.</s>",5,5.0,5.0

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost for the adult meals and then subtract the free kids' meals.

1. Calculate the cost for the adult meals:
   Each adult meal costs $7. If there are 4 adults (13 total people - 9 kids), then the cost for the adult meals is 4 * $7 = $28.

2. Calculate the cost for the kids' meals:
   The problem states that kids eat free, so there's no cost for the kids' meals.

3. Calculate the total cost for the group to eat:
   Since there's no cost for the kids' meals and the adult meals cost $28, the total cost for the group to eat is $28.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Paige had a total of 43 math problems and 12 science problems. So, the total number of problems she had was 43 + 12 = 55 problems.

2. She finished 44% of her problems at school. To find out how many problems she finished at school, we calculate 44% of 55 problems. This is done by multiplying 55 by 0.44 (which is the decimal equivalent of 44%):

55 * 0.44 = 24.2

Since we can't have a fraction of a problem, we round this to the nearest whole number. So, Paige finished 24 problems at school.

3. To find out how many problems she had to do for homework, we subtract the number of problems she finished at school from the total number of problems she had:

55 - 24 = 31 problems

So, Paige had to do 31 problems for homework.

                [/INST] The problem is asking for a calculation based on the points rachel scores for treasures found in the video game. We know that:

1. Rachel scores 9 points for each treasure she finds.
2. She found 5 treasures in the first level.
3. She found 2 treasures in the second level.

Now the solution is as follows:

1. Calculate score from first level: `Points from first level = Points per treasure * Treasures found in first level = 9 * 5`
2. Calculate score from second level: `Points from second level = Points per treasure * Treasures found in second level = 9 * 2`
3. Sum of scores from both levels: `Total points = Points from first level + Points from second level`

```python
Points from first level = 9 * 5 = 45
Points from second level = 9 * 2 = 18
Total points = 45 + 18 = 63

1. We have a total of 5 boys and 40 girls on the debate team.
2. The girls are 8 times the number of boys. (Since 40 is 8 times 5)
3. Now, we want to know how many groups of 9 we can make. 
4. To do this, we need to find out the total number of students (boys + girls): 5 boys + 40 girls = 45 students

                [/INST] To answer this question, we need to follow a series of logical steps:

1. First, we need to determine how many cupcakes Megan has left after Todd ate some of them. We know that Todd ate 43 cupcakes, so we subtract that from the total number of cupcakes Megan baked:

   Number of cupcakes left = Total cupcakes - Eaten cupcakes
   = 71 - 43
   = 28

2. Now that we know Megan has 28 cupcakes left, we can determine how many packages she can make if she puts 7 cupcakes in each package. We do this by dividing the number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package:

   Number of packages = Cupcakes left / Cupcakes per package
   = 28 / 7
   = 4

So, Megan can make 4 packages of cupcakes with the remaining cupcakes.

                [/INST] First, we need to determine how many flowers remain after 47 of them wilted. We do this by subtracting the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers Wendy picked:

103 (total flowers) - 47 (wilted flowers) = 56 (remaining flowers)

Next, we need to figure out how many bouquets Wendy can still make with the remaining flowers. We do this by dividing the number of remaining flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet:

56 (remaining flowers) / 8 (flowers per bouquet) = 7 (bouquets)

So, Wendy can still make 7 bouquets for her friend's wedding. {The final answer is 7 bouquets.}</s>",7,7.0,7.0

1. Adam initially had 48 books.
2. He sold 19 books, so we subtract 19 from the initial number of books to find out how many he had left after the sale: 48 - 19 = 29 books.
3. He used the money earned from selling these books to buy 38 new books. We add the number of new books to the remaining books in the previous step: 29 (remaining books) + 38 (new books) = 67 books.

                [/INST] First, we need to determine the total number of sodas Tom bought. He bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas, so the total number of sodas is:

Total sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
= 4 + 52
= 56 sodas

Next, we need to determine how many shelves Tom would fill up. Each shelf can hold 7 sodas, so the number of shelves needed is:

1. The school cafeteria started with 38 apples.
2. They used 20 apples to make lunch for the students.

So, to find out how many apples they have left, we subtract the apples used from the initial amount:

38 - 20 = 18 apples remaining.

3. Then, they bought 28 more apples.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trips Luke would need to make if he could carry 4 trays at a time.

First, let's add up the total number of trays Luke has to pick up:
20 trays from one table + 16 trays from another table = 36 trays

Next, we'll determine how many trips Luke would need to make if he carried 4 trays at a time:
36 trays ÷ 4 trays per trip = 9 trips

However, since Luke can't make a fraction of a trip, if there are any trays left over after a completed trip, he would need to make an extra trip for those remaining trays.

In this case, 36 trays ÷ 4 trays per trip = 9 trips exactly, so Luke doesn't need to make an extra trip.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we first need to understand that Frank wants to buy toys that cost 8 dollars each, and he has a total of 3 and 37 dollars. Let's break down the solution step by step:

1. **Combine the amounts Frank has**: Frank initially has 3 dollars, and then he receives another 37 dollars for his allowance. So, the total amount Frank has is calculated by adding these two amounts together:
   \[
   3 + 37 = 40
   \]
   This means Frank has a total of 40 dollars.

2. **Calculate the number of toys he can buy**: Since each toy costs 8 dollars, to find out how many toys Frank can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one toy. This gives us:
   \[
   \frac{40}{8} = 5
   \]
   This calculation shows that Frank can buy 5 toys with his 40 dollars.

Therefore, the final answer, clearly indicating the number of toys Frank can buy, is:

                [/INST] To understand the problem, we need to identify who is Tiffany and what she wants to do. From the sentences given, it seems like Tiffany wants to make more brownies because she needs more than the current 8 brownies. Let's approach this step by step:

1. **Define the goal**: Tiffany's goal is to make a total of 17 brownies.

2. **Calculate the total amount of flour needed for 17 brownies**: Tiffany used 1 cup of flour for each brownie previously. To make 17 brownies, she would need 17 cups of flour in total.

3. **Evaluate the current situation**: Out of the 17 cups, Tiffany has already used some. Since she baked 8 brownies, she has used 8 * 1 = 8 cups of flour.

4. **Determine the remaining amount of flour**: To find out how many more cups of flour Tiffany needs, subtract the amount she has already used from the total amount needed.
   
   `Remaining Flour = Total Flour - Used Flour`
   `Remaining Flour = 17 - 8`
   `Remaining Flour = 9`

                [/INST] Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

1. Frank made $19 over the summer mowing lawns.
2. He spent $11 on new mower blades.
3. We want to find out how many $2 games Frank could buy with the money he had left.

To solve this problem, we need to subtract the amount spent on mower blades from the total amount made:

$19 (money made) - $11 (money spent) = $8 left

Now, we can calculate how many $2 games Frank could buy with the $8 left:

$8 (money left) / $2 (game price) = 4 games

So, Frank could buy 4 games with the money he had left.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mike made from both jobs:

Money made from mowing lawns = $14
Money made from weed eating = $26

Total money made = Money made from mowing lawns + Money made from weed eating = $14 + $26 = $40

Next, let's calculate how much money Mike has left after each week:

Money spent per week = $5

After the first week, Mike would have:
Money left after the first week = Total money made - Money spent = $40 - $5 = $35

After the second week, Mike would have:
Money left after the second week = Money left after the first week - Money spent = $35 - $5 = $30

After the third week, Mike would have:
Money left after the third week = Money left after the second week - Money spent = $30 - $5 = $25

After the fourth week, Mike would have:
Money left after the fourth week = Money left after the third week - Money spent = $25 - $5 = $20

After the fifth week, Mike would have:
Money left after the fifth week = Money left after the fourth week - Money spent = $20 - $5 = $15

After the sixth week, Mike would have:
Money left after the sixth week = Money left after the fifth week - Money spent = $15 - $5 = $10

After the seventh week, Mike would have:
Money left after the seventh week = Money left after the sixth week - Money spent = $10 - $5 = $5

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Vanessa initially had two types of files: music files and video files. She had 16 music files and an unknown number of video files. Let's denote the number of video files as V.

2. So, the total number of files she had is the sum of music files and video files, which is 16 + V.

3. Vanessa then deleted 30 files. Before deleting, the total number of files was 16 + V. After deleting, the total number of files becomes (16 + V) - 30.

4. According to the problem, after deleting 30 files, there were still files left on her flash drive. So, (16 + V) - 30 > 0. We can simplify this to V > 30 - 16, which means V > 14.

5. The problem doesn't give us a specific amount for the number of files left on her flash drive after deleting. However, we can express it as (16 + V) - 30.

So, the final answer is that after deleting 30 files, the number of files left on her flash drive is 16 + V - 30, where V > 14. We can't give a specific number without knowing the exact number of video files.

                [/INST] To determine how long Jerry's money will last, we first need to find out how much he made in total. 

1. We know that Jerry made $14 from mowing lawns and $31 from weed eating.
   So, total money Jerry made = $14 + $31 = $45

2. Next, we need to find out how much he spends every week. It is stated that he spends $5 a week.

3. To find out how long the money will last, we need to divide the total money Jerry made by the amount he spends weekly.
   Since he spends $5 a week, the duration his money will last is = Total money / Weekly expenditure = $45 / $5 = 9 weeks

So, the money Jerry made will last him for 9 weeks.

                [/INST] First, we know that Kaleb collected cans for recycling on Saturday and Sunday. 

On Saturday, he filled 5 bags, and on Sunday, he filled another 5 bags. 

We also know that each bag had 4 cans in it.

To find the total number of cans Kaleb picked up, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of cans collected on Saturday.
Cans on Saturday = Bags on Saturday * Cans per bag
= 5 bags * 4 cans/bag
= 20 cans

Step 2: Calculate the number of cans collected on Sunday.
Cans on Sunday = Bags on Sunday * Cans per bag
= 5 bags * 4 cans/bag
= 20 cans

Step 3: Add the number of cans collected on Saturday and Sunday to find the total number of cans picked up.
Total cans = Cans on Saturday + Cans on Sunday
= 20 cans + 20 cans
= 40 cans

Therefore, Kaleb picked up a total of 40 cans over the weekend.

                [/INST] To find the total number of books Nancy had, we need to calculate the number of books on each type of shelf and then add them together.

1. First, let's calculate the number of books on the mystery book shelves. Nancy has 2 shelves of mystery books and each shelf has exactly 6 books. So, the total number of mystery books is:
   Number of mystery books = Number of mystery book shelves * Books per shelf
   = 2 * 6
   = 12 books

2. Next, let's calculate the number of books on the picture book shelves. Nancy has 6 shelves of picture books and each shelf has exactly 6 books. So, the total number of picture books is:
   Number of picture books = Number of picture book shelves * Books per shelf
   = 6 * 6
   = 36 books

3. Finally, to find the total number of books Nancy has, we add the number of mystery books and picture books together:
   Total number of books = Number of mystery books + Number of picture books

1. First, let's find out how much Will made on Monday:
   - Will's hourly wage: \boxed{8 \text{ dollars}}
   - Hours worked on Monday: \boxed{8 \text{ hours}}
   - Money made on Monday: Hourly wage * Hours worked = \boxed{8 \text{ dollars}} * \boxed{8 \text{ hours}} = \boxed{64 \text{ dollars}}

2. Next, let's find out how much Will made on Tuesday:

                [/INST] Luke had 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes, with each pile containing 3 coins.

To find the total number of coins, we first need to calculate the total coins in quarters and dimes separately.

1. For quarters:
Number of coins in quarters = Number of piles * Coins per pile
= 5 piles * 3 coins
= 15 coins

2. For dimes:
Number of coins in dimes = Number of piles * Coins per pile
= 5 piles * 3 coins
= 15 coins

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the total coins in quarters and dimes:

Total coins = Coins in quarters + Coins in dimes

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. George starts with $30.
2. He receives $16 more for his birthday, so we add this to his initial amount.
   That is, $30 + $16 = $46.
3. Then, he spends $138 on a new game. So, we subtract this amount from the total amount he had after receiving the birthday money.
   That is, $46 - $138 = -$92.

However, it seems there might be a mistake in the question as spending $138 on a game with only $46 after receiving the birthday money doesn't make sense. If George bought a $138 game, he would be spending more than he earned.

If we assume George had enough money to buy the game, the correct calculation would be: $30 + $16 = $46 and then $46 - $138 = -$92. But since he can't afford the game with just $16 more, let's correct the question and assume he bought a less expensive game.

Let's say he bought a $38 game instead (which would make more sense given his initial $30 and the $16 he received). So, the calculation would be: $30 + $16 = $46. He spent $38 of that, so: $46 - $38 = $8.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to determine the number of birds in each cage. According to the problem, each cage has 8 parrots and 2 parakeets. Therefore, the number of birds in each cage is 8 (parrots) + 2 (parakeets) = 10 birds.

2. Next, we need to determine how many cages there are. The problem states that the number of cages is equal to the number of birds. Since each cage has 10 birds (from step 1), the number of cages is equal to the number of birds divided by the number of birds per cage. If we assume that the number of birds is the total number of birds in the store, then the number of cages is total number of birds / 10.

3. Finally, we want to find the total number of birds in the store. Since the number of birds is equal to the number of cages and each cage has 10 birds, the total number of birds is 10 (birds per cage) * total number of cages.

However, we don't have the actual total number of birds or cages in the problem. We only know the ratio of birds to cages is 1:1. Therefore, we can only express the answer in terms of the variables.

If we denote the total number of birds (or cages) as B, then the total number of birds is B * 10.

                [/INST] This problem can be solved in a few steps:

1. Subtract the amount Mike spent on new mower blades from the total amount he made over the summer. This will leave us with the amount he has left.
   So, $69 (total amount) - $24 (amount spent) = $45 (amount left).

2. Next, we want to find out how many 5 dollar games Mike can buy with the money he has left.
   To do this, divide the amount he has left by the cost of one game.
   So, $45 (amount left) / $5 (cost per game) = 9 games.

                [/INST] First, let's add up the total number of cookies Maria has:

Total cookies = Chocolate chip cookies + Oatmeal cookies
= 5 + 19
= 24 cookies

Next, since each baggie contains 8 cookies, we can find the maximum number of baggies Maria can make by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per baggie:

Maximum baggies = Total cookies / Cookies per baggie
= 24 / 8
= 3 baggies

However, we need to subtract any remaining cookies that don't fill up a baggie completely. To do this, we can use the modulo operator to find the remainder when the total number of cookies is divided by the number of cookies per baggie:

Remaining cookies = Total cookies % Cookies per baggie

= 0 cookies

Since there are no remaining cookies, Maria can make exactly 3 full baggies of cookies.

                [/INST] First, let's denote the amount of money Mike had left after buying new mower blades as X.

We know that Mike earned 42 dollars and spent 10 dollars on mower blades. So, the amount of money he had left can be found using the equation:

X = Total money - Cost of mower blades
X = 42 dollars - 10 dollars
X = 32 dollars

Now, we need to find out how many 8 dollar games he could buy with the money he had left. We can do this by dividing the amount of money he had left by the cost of one game:

Number of games = Money left / Cost per game
Number of games = 32 dollars / 8 dollars
Number of games = 4

So, Mike could buy 4 games with the money he had left.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we start by adding the total number of pictures Wendyuploaded from her phone and camera:

- Wendy uploaded 22 pictures from her phone.
- Wendy uploaded 2 pictures from her camera.
- Total pictures uploaded = 22 (from phone) + 2 (from camera) = $24$ pictures.

Next, we need to find out how many pictures were in each album. Since she sorted these pictures into 4 different albums with the same amount of pictures in each, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

- Total pictures = $24$
- Number of albums = $4$
- Pictures in each album = Total pictures / Number of albums = $24 / 4 = 6$

Therefore, Wendy put $\boxed{6}$ pictures in each album.</s>",6,6.0,6.0

First, let's consider the 9 trays from the first table. Jerry will need to make one trip with 8 trays and then make a second trip for the remaining 1 tray.

Now, he still needs to pick up 7 more trays from the second table. He can carry 8 trays at a time, so he will make one full trip and then make a second trip for the remaining 1 tray.

So, the total number of trips he will make is 1 (for the first table) + 1 (for the first trip for the second table) + 1 (for the second trip for the second table) = 3 trips.

   82 - 37 = 45

3. Wendy then put the remaining 45 files into folders, with 5 files in each one.

4. To find out how many folders she ended up with, we divide the number of files by the number of files per folder.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of players on the baseball team. This is the sum of the number of new players and the number of returning players:

Total players = New players + Returning players
Total players = 12 + 44
Total players = 56

Then, we need to determine how many groups of 8 players can be made from the total number of players. This is the total number of players divided by the number of players in each group:

Number of groups = Total players / Players per group
Number of groups = 56 / 8
Number of groups = 7

1. Nancy initially picked 12 carrots from her garden.

2. She then threw out 2 of them. So, the number of carrots she has after throwing out 2 is:
   Number of carrots after throwing out = Initial number of carrots - Number of carrots thrown out
   = 12 - 2
   = 10

3. The next day, Nancy picked 21 more carrots. So, the total number of carrots she has after picking 21 more is:
   Total number of carrots = Number of carrots after throwing out + Number of carrots picked the next day
   = 10 + 21
   = 31

So, Nancy would have a total of 31 carrots.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we'll break it down into clear, logical steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rides Oliver went on**:
   Oliver went on the ferris wheel 5 times and the bumper cars 4 times. So, the total number of rides he went on is:
   \[
   5 + 4 = 9 \text{ rides}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of tickets used**:
   Since each ride costs 7 tickets, and Oliver went on 9 rides, the total number of tickets he used is:
   \[
   9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ tickets}
   \]

Therefore, the final answer, encapsulated as requested, is:

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to find out the total number of games Ned bought. He bought 50 games from a friend and 27 more at a garage sale. So, the total number of games he bought is 50 + 27 = 77 games.

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these games were good. We know that 74 of the games didn't work, so if we subtract the number of games that didn't work from the total number of games, we'll get the number of good games.

3. Therefore, the number of good games Ned ended up with is 77 (total games) - 74 (bad games) = 3 games.

Initial total = Number of Siamese cats + Number of house cats
= 38 + 25
= 63

Then, we subtract the number of cats sold from the initial total to find out how many cats are left:

= 63 - 45
= 18

So, the pet store has 18 cats left.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many points Carol had after the second round. We know that in the first round she scored 17 points and in the second round she scored 6 points. So, after the second round she had:
   Points after second round = Points in first round + Points in second round
   = 17 + 6
   = 23 points

2. In the last round, Carol lost 16 points. So, to find out how many points she had at the end of the game, we subtract the points she lost in the last round from the points she had after the second round:

2. During the lunch rush, he added another 12 customers, making the total number of customers: 39 + 12 = 51 customers.
3. Out of these 51 customers, 49 of them didn't leave a tip. This means that the number of customers that did leave a tip is the remainder when we subtract the 49 customers who didn't tip from the total number of customers.

So, the number of customers that left a tip is: 51 (total customers) - 49 (customers who didn't tip) = 2 customers.

                [/INST] To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing Zoe has, we need to calculate the total number of scarves and mittens from all the boxes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of scarves.
Zoe found 8 boxes of clothing, and each box contains 4 scarves. So, the total number of scarves is:
Total scarves = Number of scarves per box * Number of boxes

Each box also contains 6 mittens. So, the total number of mittens is:
Total mittens = Number of mittens per box * Number of boxes

Zoe has both scarves and mittens. So, the total number of winter clothing is:
