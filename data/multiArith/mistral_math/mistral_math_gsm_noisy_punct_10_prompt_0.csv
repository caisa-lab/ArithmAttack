                    question:
                     Paige ? had 11 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 9 old songs from ? it and then added 8 new songs, how many songs ! does she have on her mp3 ? player? 
                [/INST] The problem states that Paige initially had 11 songs on her mp3 player. She then deleted 9 songs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of songs remaining on her mp3 player after deleting 9 songs.
Remaining songs = Initial songs - Deleted songs
Remaining songs = 11 - 9 = 2

Then she added 8 new songs to the remaining songs.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of songs on her mp3 player after adding 8 new songs.
Total songs = Remaining songs + New songs
Total songs = 2 + 8 = 10

So, Paige has 10 songs on her mp3 player. The final answer is \boxed{10}.</s>",10

                    question:
                     There were 39 girls and 4 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 26 , of them got called back, how many students didn't make ; the , cut? 
                [/INST] Let's reason through this problem step-by-step:

1. First, we need to find out the total number of students who tried out for the basketball team. This is simply the sum of the number of girls and boys, which is 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students.

2. Next, we know that only 26 students got called back. To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we need to subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students.

3. So, the number of students who didn't make the cut is total students - students who got called back = 43 students - 26 students = 17 students.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is 17 students}.</s>",17

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. Faye initially had 34 coloring books.
2. She gave away 3 of them, so we subtract 3 from the initial number.
   Therefore, 34 - 3 = 31
3. Then, she bought 48 more coloring books. So, we add 48 to the remaining number.
   Therefore, 31 + 48 = 79
   
So, the final answer is that Faye would have a total of 79 coloring books.</s>",79

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to figure out how many enemies you defeated. You destroyed all but 3, so that means you defeated 11 - 3 = 8 enemies.

2. Each enemy defeated gives you 9 points. So, if you defeated 8 enemies, you would earn 8 * 9 = 72 points.

Step 2: Calculate the points Megan earned for each bag.
Points per bag = 8 points

Step 3: Calculate the total points Megan earned.
Total points = Points per bag * Total bags recycled

                [/INST] The problem states that Ned had to wash a total of 9 short sleeve shirts + 21 long sleeve shirts = 30 shirts before school.

However, he only washed 29 of them by the time school started.

So, to find out how many shirts Ned did not wash, we subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts he had to wash:

30 shirts (total) - 29 shirts (washed) = 1 shirt (not washed)

Therefore, the final answer is that Ned did not wash 1 shirt. {The final answer is: \boxed{1}}</s>",1

                     A company invited , 47 people to a luncheon, but 7 of them didn't show up. If the tables they ; had held 5 people each, how many tables do they need? 
                [/INST] Here's the step-by-step reasoning for this problem:

1. First, we need to determine the total number of people who actually attended the luncheon. This is done by subtracting the number of people who didn't show up from the total number of people invited.
   Total number of people present = Total number of people invited - Number of people who didn't show up
   = 47 - 7
   = 40

2. The next step is to figure out how many tables are needed for 40 people, given that each table seats 5 people.
   Number of tables = Total number of people present / People per table
   = 40 / 5
   = 8

The final answer is \boxed{8}.</s>",8

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. Initially, Tom had 5 books.
2. He sold 4 of them. So, the number of books he has now is 5 - 4 = 1 book.
3. He used the money he earned to buy 38 new books. So, the total number of books he has now is 1 + 38 = 39 books.

So, Tom would have {39} books in total after selling and buying new books.</s>",39

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. Jerry bought a total of 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. So, the total number of sodas he bought is 41 + 22 = 63 sodas.

2. Each shelf can hold 9 sodas. So, to find out how many shelves he would fill up, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.

So, 63 sodas ÷ 9 sodas per shelf = 7 shelves.

The final answer is {Jerry would fill up 7 shelves}.</s>",7

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many pieces of candy Debby and her sister had in total. They had 32 pieces (Debby's) and 42 pieces (sister's). So, they had 32 + 42 = 74 pieces of candy in total.

2. Then, they ate 35 pieces of candy the first night. So, to find out how many pieces they have left, we subtract the pieces they ate from the total amount they had. That is, 74 - 35 = 39 pieces of candy.

So, {The final answer is 39 pieces of candy left}.</s>",39

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many seeds were left from the initial 41 seeds after Emily planted 29 of them in her big garden. Then, we can use that information to find out how many small gardens she had.

1. Initial number of seeds = 41
2. Seeds planted in the big garden = 29

Now, let's find the number of seeds left:

3. Remaining seeds = Initial number of seeds - Seeds planted in the big garden
4. Remaining seeds = 41 - 29
5. Remaining seeds = 12

Next, we need to find out how many seeds were in each of her small gardens:

6. Seeds per small garden = 4

Now, we can calculate the number of small gardens Emily had:

7. Number of small gardens = Remaining seeds / Seeds per small garden
8. Number of small gardens = 12 / 4
9. Number of small gardens = 3

So, Emily had 3 small gardens.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we follow these steps:

1. First, we calculate the total amount of candy Emily received. She got 5 pieces from neighbors and 13 pieces from her sister. So, the total amount of candy is:
\[5 + 13 = 18\]

2. Next, we need to determine how long the candy would last her if she ate 9 pieces a day. To find out, we divide the total amount of candy by the amount she eats daily:
\[18 \div 9 = 2\]

Therefore, the candy would last her for 2 days.

                    .  A teacher had 34 worksheets to grade. If she graded 7, but then another 36 were turned in, how many worksheets would she have to grade? 
                [/INST] First, let's understand the problem. The teacher initially has 34 worksheets to grade. She then grades 7 of them, which potentially reduces the number of worksheets to grade. After that, another 36 worksheets are turned in, which would increase the number of worksheets she needs to grade.

The key here is to understand that grading worksheets does not necessarily mean she completes them. They may still need to be graded even after some have been graded.

So, initially, the teacher has 34 worksheets. After grading 7, she would have 34 - 7 = 27 worksheets left to grade. Then, if 36 more worksheets are added, she would have 27 + 36 = 63 worksheets to grade in total.

Final answer: {The teacher would have to grade 63 worksheets.}</s>",63

Total customers = Initial customers + Lunch rush customers
Total customers = 26 + 27
Total customers = 53

Next, we know that 27 of the customers didn't leave a tip. So, to find out how many customers did leave a tip, we subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers:

Customers left a tip = Total customers - Customers who didn't leave a tip
Customers left a tip = 53 - 27
Customers left a tip = 26

1. First, we need to find out the total number of giant stuffed bears the toy store has now. Initially, they had 17 bears, and then they got another shipment with 10 bears. So, we add these two numbers together:

Total bears = Initial bears + Additional bears
= 17 + 10
= 27 bears

2. Next, we need to find out how many shelves they used to store these bears. They put 9 bears on each shelf. So, we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf:

Number of shelves = Total bears / Bears per shelf
= 27 / 9
= 3 shelves

So, the toy store used 3 shelves to store the giant stuffed bears.

Final answer:
Wendy put 7 pictures into each of the 5 different albums.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we'll break it down into several steps to make it clear how each part of the problem affects the total score.

1. **Determine the number of members who did show up:** The trivia team had a total of 11 members, and 6 members didn't show up. To find out how many members did show up, we subtract the number of members who didn't show up from the total number of members:

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find the total number of sodas Tom bought. He bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas, so in total, he bought 4 + 52 = 56 sodas.

2. Next, we need to determine how many shelves he would fill up. Each shelf can hold 7 sodas. So, to find out how many shelves he would fill up, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold.

56 sodas ÷ 7 sodas/shelf = 8 shelves

So, Tom would fill up 8 shelves with his sodas.

Therefore, the final answer is {8 shelves}.</s>",8

                [/INST] Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. We start with 38 apples. This is our initial quantity of apples.
2. The cafeteria used 20 apples to make lunch for the students. So, the remaining number of apples is calculated by subtracting the used apples from the initial quantity: 38 - 20 = 18 apples.
3. After using some apples, the cafeteria bought 28 more apples. Now their total amount of apples is the sum of the remaining apples and the new purchase: 18 + 28 = 46 apples.

So, the cafeteria would have 46 apples in total.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to find out how many full trips Luke can make with the trays he has to carry, and then find out if there are any trays left that can't complete a full trip.

1. The first table has 20 trays. Luke can carry 4 trays at a time, so he will make 20 / 4 = 5 full trips from this table.

2. The second table has 16 trays. Luke can carry 4 trays at a time, so he will make 16 / 4 = 4 full trips from this table.

3. The total number of trips Luke will make is 5 (from the first table) + 4 (from the second table) = 9 trips.

4. Check if there are any trays left over. The first table had a remainder of 20 % 4 = 0 trays, and the second table had a remainder of 16 % 4 = 0 trays. So, there are no trays left over.

Therefore, {Luke will make a total of 9 trips}.</s>",9

                [/INST] First, we need to determine how many apples were left after the cafeteria handed out 42 to students. This can be done by subtracting the number of apples given to students from the total number of apples.

96 (total apples) - 42 (apples given to students) = 54 apples left

Next, we need to figure out how many pies can be made from the remaining apples. This can be calculated by dividing the number of apples left by the number of apples required to make one pie.

54 (apples left) ÷ 6 (apples per pie) = 9 pies

So, the cafeteria can make 9 pies from the remaining apples.

                [/INST] Henry already has 3 action figures and needs 8 in total to have a complete collection.

First, we need to find out how many more action figures he needs to buy. To do this, we subtract the number of action figures he already has from the total number he needs:
\[8 - 3 = 5\]

Next, we calculate the cost of these 5 action figures. Since each one costs $6, we multiply the cost per action figure by the number of action figures needed:
\[5 \times \$6 = \$30\]

1. Frank initially had $3.

2. Then, he received an additional $37 for his allowance.

3. To find the total amount of money Frank has, we add these two amounts together: $3 + $37 = $40.

Now that we know Frank has $40, we can determine how many 8-dollar toys he could buy.

4. To find out how many 8-dollar toys Frank can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has ($40) by the cost of each toy ($8): $40 ÷ $8 = 5.

Tiffany initially needed 17 brownies, but she only baked 8. So, she still needs 17 - 8 = 9 more brownies.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of flour needed for the additional brownies.
Each brownie requires 8 cups of flour. So, for the remaining 9 brownies, Tiffany will need 9 * 8 = 72 cups of flour.

Step 3: Determine if Tiffany has any flour left.
Since the question does not provide information about how much flour Tiffany had at the start, we cannot determine if she has enough flour for her additional brownies.

Step 4: If Tiffany does have enough flour, calculate how much more she needs.
If Tiffany has enough flour, she doesn't need any more. If she doesn't have enough, then she still needs 72 cups of flour.

                     There are 65 students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 17 of them didn't get picked ? for the team and the rest were put into 8 groups, how many students would be in each group? 
                [/INST] This problem can be solved by using simple division.

Step 1: Identify the number of students who got picked. Since 17 did not get picked, the total number of students who got picked is:
65 students (total) - 17 students (not picked) = 48 students (picked)

Step 2: Divide the number of students picked by the number of groups to find out how many students would be in each group.
48 students (picked) ÷ 8 groups = 6 students per group

{The final answer is} 6 students would be in each group.</s>",6

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to find out how much money Paul has after receiving his allowance. He saved $3 and then received another $7. So, $3 (saved money) + $7 (allowance) = $10.

2. Next, we need to determine how many $5 toys he can buy with $10. To do this, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one toy. So, $10 (total money) ÷ $5 (cost per toy) = 2 toys.

So, Paul can buy 2 five-dollar toys. {The final answer is: 2}.</s>",2

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate how many quarters Luke has. He has 5 piles of quarters, and each pile contains 3 coins. So, the total number of quarters is 5 (piles) * 3 (coins per pile) = 15 quarters.

2. Next, we calculate the total number of dimes. He also has 5 piles of dimes, with each pile containing 3 coins. So, the total number of dimes is 5 (piles) * 3 (coins per pile) = 15 dimes.

3. Finally, to find the total number of coins, we add the total number of quarters and the total number of dimes. So, the total number of coins is 15 (quarters) + 15 (dimes) = 30 coins.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is 30 coins}.</s>",30

                [/INST] First, let's find out how many points each person earned separately.

Gwen recycled 5 pounds of paper. According to the rule, for every 3 pounds they recycled, they earned one point. So, for 5 pounds, Gwen earned:

Points_Gwen = Total_pounds_Gwen / Pounds_per_point
= 5 / 3
≈ 1.67 points

Since points can't be divided into fractions, Gwen earned 1 point for recycling 3 pounds and didn't earn a full point for the remaining 2 pounds.

Gwen's friends recycled 13 pounds of paper. So, they earned:

Points_friends = Total_pounds_friends / Pounds_per_point
= 13 / 3
≈ 4.33 points

Again, for the same reason as above, Gwen's friends earned 4 points for recycling 12 pounds and didn't earn a full point for the remaining 1 pound.

Now, let's add up the points earned by Gwen and her friends:

Total_points = Points_Gwen + Points_friends
= 1 + 4
= 5 points

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets for Haley and her friends. Since Haley bought 3 tickets and each ticket costs $4, the total cost for these tickets is:
\[3 \times 4 = \$12.\]

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on the extra tickets. Since she bought 0.5 extra tickets and each ticket costs $4, the total cost for the extra tickets is:
\[0.5 \times 4 = \$2.\]

To find the total amount Haley spent, we add the cost of the tickets for herself and her friends to the cost of the extra tickets:
\[12 + 2 = \$14.\]

Therefore, Haley spent a total of $\boxed{\$14}$ on concert tickets.</s>",32

1. Calculate the total amount of money George had after receiving money for his birthday:
   Money received for birthday = $16
   Initial money = $30
   Adding these amounts gives:
   Total money after birthday = Initial money + Money received for birthday = $30 + $16 = $46

2. Subtract the amount spent on the new game from the total money after the birthday:
   Money spent on game = $38
   Total money after birthday = $46
   Subtracting the amount spent from the total money gives:
   Remaining money = Total money after birthday - Money spent on game = $46 - $38 = $8

2. Next, we calculate the number of books on the picture shelves. Each of these shelves also has 8 books, but there are only 4 of them. So, we multiply 8 by 4.
   8 * 4 = 32

3. Finally, to find the total number of books, we add the number of mystery books and picture books together.
   40 + 32 = 72

So, Bianca has a total of {72 books}.</s>",72

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem:

1. Bianca recycled 24 pounds of paper.

2. Her friends recycled 3 pounds of paper.

3. For every 3 pounds of paper recycled, they earn one point.

Now, let's calculate the points earned by each:

Points earned by Bianca = Pounds recycled by Bianca / Pounds needed for a point * Points for partial recycling

Bianca recycled 24 pounds, which is 8 times the amount needed for a point (since 3 pounds = 1 point), so she gets 8 points. But there might be some recycling left over. To find out how many points this represents, we calculate the remainder when 24 is divided by 3. The remainder is 0, so Bianca does not earn any additional points for the partial recycling.

Points earned by Bianca = 8 points

Similarly, for Bianca's friends:

Points earned by friends = Pounds recycled by friends / Pounds needed for a point * Points for partial recycling

Their friends recycled 3 pounds, which is exactly the amount needed for a point. So, they get 1 point.

Points earned by friends = 1 point

Finally, to find the total points earned, we add the points earned by Bianca and her friends:

Total points = Points earned by Bianca + Points earned by friends

Total points = 8 points + 1 point

Total points = 9 points

So, the final answer is {The final answer is \boxed{9}}.</s>",9

3. Then he bought 13 new socks, so we add 13 to the 14 socks he had left:
   14 + 13 = 27 socks.

So, John would have 27 socks after throwing away the old ones and buying new ones.

1. Initially, there were 22 customers in the waiter's section.
2. Out of these, 14 customers left, leaving 22 - 14 = 8 customers remaining in the section.
3. The problem states that each of the remaining tables had 4 people at them.

Now, to find out how many pictures she still has, we subtract the number of pictures she deleted from the total number of pictures she took.

Pictures still left = Total pictures taken - Pictures deleted
Pictures still left = 58 - 38 = 20

So, Haley still has 20 pictures from her vacation.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. The florist starts with 5 roses.
2. She then sells 3 roses, so she has 5 - 3 = 2 roses left.
3. She later picks 34 more roses.

So, if she has 2 roses left from the initial 5 and then picks 34 more, she would have 2 + 34 = 36 roses in total.

                [/INST] Cody bought a total of 4 regular sodas + 44 diet sodas = 48 sodas.

His fridge can hold 6 sodas on each shelf.

To find out how many shelves he would fill up, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas per shelf:

48 sodas ÷ 6 sodas/shelf = 8 shelves.

                    !  The schools debate team had . 26 boys and 46 girls on it. If they were split into groups of 9 how many groups could they make? 
                [/INST] The problem asks us to find the number of groups that can be made from 26 boys and 46 girls when they are split into groups of 9.

Step 1: Determine the number of boys that can be grouped.
This is calculated by dividing the total number of boys by the group size.

Number of boys = 26
Group size = 9

Number of boy groups = Number of boys / Group size
= 26 / 9
≈ 2.89

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 2 groups of boys. This means there are 26 - 2*9 = 8 boys left.

Step 2: Determine the number of girls that can be grouped.

Number of girls = 46
Group size = 9

Number of girl groups = Number of girls / Group size
= 46 / 9
≈ 5.11

We also take the integer part, which is 5 groups of girls. This means there are 46 - 5*9 = 1 girl left.

Step 3: Determine the total number of groups.

Total groups = Number of boy groups + Number of girl groups
= 2 + 5
= 7

But we have 8 boys left and 1 girl left, so we can't form another group with them. However, we can still form another group if we combine the 8 boys and 1 girl. That makes 9 members, so we can form 1 more group.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to understand that the cafeteria ordered more apples than needed, and we need to find out how many extra apples there were.

1. First, let's find out the total number of apples ordered by the cafeteria. They ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples. So, the total number of apples is:
   Total apples = Red apples + Green apples
   = 6 + 15
   = 21 apples

2. Next, we need to find out how many apples are needed for 5 students. Since each student wants fruit, and we can assume that one apple is given to each student, so the number of apples needed is equal to the number of students.
   Apples needed = Number of students
   = 5

3. Finally, to find out how many extra apples there were, we subtract the number of apples needed from the total number of apples ordered.
   Extra apples = Total apples - Apples needed
   = 21 - 5
   = 16 apples

1. The book store initially had 4 books in the bargain bin.

2. They sold 3 books, so they remove those from the total. 4 books - 3 books = 1 book.

3. Then, they added 10 more books to the bin. So, the number of books becomes 1 book + 10 books.

Therefore, there would be 11 books in the bin after these transactions.

                [/INST] April's discount flowers is having a sale where each flower costs $8. Vanessa bought 3 roses and 3 daisies, so we need to calculate the total cost of these flowers. 

First, let's identify the number of roses and daisies Vanessa bought:
 Roses = 3
 Daisies = 3

Next, we can calculate the cost of roses and daisies separately by multiplying the number of each type of flower by the cost per flower:

Cost of roses = Number of roses * Cost per flower
               = 3 roses * $8/flower
               = $24

Cost of daisies = Number of daisies * Cost per flower
                = 3 daisies * $8/flower
                = $24

Now, to find the total cost, we add the cost of roses and daisies:

Total cost = Cost of roses + Cost of daisies
           = $24 + $24
           = $48

Therefore, {The final answer is} Vanessa spent $48 on flowers.</s>",48

                [/INST] First, we need to find the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded to Facebook from her phone and camera. 

Total pictures = (Pictures from phone) + (Pictures from camera)
Total pictures = 5 ! + 35 ;

However, there seems to be an inconsistency in the given information; ""!"" and "";"" are not standard symbols for representing numbers, and without their values, we cannot proceed with the problem.

If we were to use ""!"" as factorial and "";"" as a placeholder for a missing number or a typo, we would first find the value of 5!, which equals 5*4*3*2*1 (factorial) = 120.

Let's assume the correct picture count from her camera is 35; = 350 (assuming "";"" is a placeholder for a number like 10). However, without knowing the exact value of "";"", we cannot move forward.

Next, we'll find the total number of pictures:
Total pictures = 5! + 350
Total pictures = 120 + 350
Total pictures = 470

Finally, we'll determine how many pictures are in each album:
Number of pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Number of pictures per album = 470 / 8
Number of pictures per album = 58.75

As we cannot have a fraction of a picture, there must be an error in the initial data provided, as the number of pictures in each album should be a whole number.

                [/INST] Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much money Will had left after buying the new mower blades. He made $104 and spent $41, so he has $104 - $41 = $63 left.

2. Next, we need to find out how many $9 games he can buy with the money he has left. To do this, we divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of one game. So, $63 divided by $9 is 7 games.

The final answer is that Will could buy 7 $9 games with the money he had left.</s>",7

                [/INST] To find out how many bad carrots Faye and her mother had, we first need to determine the total number of carrots they picked. They picked 23 plus however many are represented by the ""?"" in the provided question. Since the context is not provided, we'll assume that ""?"" represents a number. Let's call it ""x"". So, Faye picked 23+x carrots and her mother picked 5 carrots, making the total number of carrots 23+x+5.

We know that only 12 of these carrots were good, so the rest must be bad. Let's call the number of bad carrots ""b"". We can use this information to create an equation:

Total number of carrots (23+x+5) = Good carrots (12) + Bad carrots (b)

Solving for b, we get:

b = 23+x+5-12
b = x+26

Since we don't have a value for x, we can't determine the exact number of bad carrots. However, we can say that the number of bad carrots is equal to the unknown number represented by ""?"" plus 26.

Now let's calculate how many flowers she has left:

1. Start with the initial number of flowers: 66.
2. Subtract the number of flowers that wilted: 66 - 10 = 56.

So, Isabel has 56 flowers left.

Next, let's determine how many bouquets she can still make:

   = 63 cats

2. Next, we know that the store sold 45 cats during the sale. So, to find out how many cats they have left, we subtract the number of cats sold from the original number of cats:

Number of cats left = Original number of cats - Number of cats sold
   = 63 - 45

So, the pet store has 18 cats left after the sale. It's clear that the final answer is 18:

2. They used 13 of those apples to make lunch, so now they have `14 - 13 = 1` apple left.
3. After using some apples, they bought 49 more. So, the total number of apples they have now is `1 + 49 = 50`.

So, the cafeteria would have 50 apples.</s>",50

                [/INST] To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing Zoe has, we first need to find the total number of scarves and mittens in one box, and then multiply that by the number of boxes she has.

Step 1: Find the total number of scarves and mittens in one box.
Scarves in one box = 4
Mittens in one box = 6
Total pieces in one box = Scarves + Mittens = 4 + 6 = 10

Step 2: Multiply the total pieces in one box by the total number of boxes.
Total pieces of winter clothing = Total pieces in one box * Total boxes = 10 * 8 = 80

So, Zoe has a total of 80 pieces of winter clothing.

{The final answer is \boxed{80}.}</s>",80

                [/INST] Frank bought 3 decks and his friend bought 2 decks.

First, we need to find out how much Frank and his friend spent on their decks.

Frank's decks cost 3 (number of decks) x 7 (dollars per deck) = 21 dollars.

His friend's decks cost 2 (number of decks) x 7 (dollars per deck) = 14 dollars.

Now, let's add up what Frank spent and what his friend spent:

Total spent = Frank's decks + Friend's decks = 21 + 14 = 35 dollars.

\boxed{35} dollars.</s>",35

                    question:
                     Sam had to wash 40 short sleeve shirts and 23 long sleeve shirts . before school. . If ; he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not : wash? 
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to add the total number of shirts Sam had to wash and then subtract the number of shirts he actually washed.

First, let's add the total number of shirts:
40 (short sleeve shirts) + 23 (long sleeve shirts) = 63 shirts

Next, let's subtract the number of shirts Sam actually washed:
63 (total shirts) - 29 (washed shirts) = 34 shirts

So, Sam did not wash 34 shirts.

                    question:
                     A waiter had 47 : customers to wait on. If 41 customers left and he got another 20 customers, how many customers would he have? 
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. The waiter initially had 47 customers.
2. When 41 customers left, the number of customers remaining would be calculated by subtracting 41 from 47.

Customers remaining = Initial customers - Customers left
= 47 - 41
= 6

3. Then, the waiter got another 20 customers. To find out the total number of customers he would have now, we add the new customers to the customers remaining.

Total customers = Customers remaining + New customers
= 6 + 20
= 26

So, the final answer is {The waiter would have 26 customers}.</s>",26
