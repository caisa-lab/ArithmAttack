                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of sodas Jerry bought and then determine how many shelves he would fill up based on the capacity of his fridge.

1. Calculate the total number of sodas:
   - Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas.
   - Total sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas = 41 + 22 = 63 sodas.

2. Determine how many shelves would be filled up:
   - Each shelf can hold 9 sodas.
   - To find out how many shelves are filled, we divide the total number of sodas by the capacity of each shelf and round up to the nearest whole number since you can't have a fraction of a shelf.
   - Shelves filled = Total sodas / Capacity per shelf = 63 / 9 = 7.

{The final answer is \boxed{7} shelves would be filled up.}</s>",7

   Candy pieces initial = Candy pieces Debby had + Candy pieces sister had
   = 32 + 42
   = 74 pieces

2. Next, let's subtract the amount they ate the first night. They ate 35 pieces, so the amount of candy they have left is:
   Candy pieces left = Candy pieces initial - Candy pieces eaten
   = 74 - 35
   = 39 pieces

So, the final answer is \boxed{39}.</s>",39

= 12

Next, let's find out how many seeds were planted in each small garden.

Seeds per small garden = Seeds not planted in big garden / Number of small gardens
4 = 12 / Number of small gardens

Now, let's rearrange the equation to solve for the number of small gardens.

Number of small gardens = Seeds not planted in big garden / Seeds per small garden
= 12 / 4
= 3

                     A new building needed 9 windows. The builder had already installed 6 of them. If it takes 6 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest? 
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. The builder has already installed 6 windows.
2. The building needs 9 windows in total.
3. Therefore, the remaining number of windows to be installed is calculated by subtracting the already installed windows from the total required windows: `9 - 6 = 3 windows`
4. Each window takes 6 hours to install.
5. Therefore, to install the remaining 3 windows, the time required is calculated by multiplying the number of remaining windows by the time taken to install each window: `3 windows * 6 hours/window = 18 hours`

So, {The final answer is 18 hours to install the rest of the windows}.</s>",18

   Number of vans = Total people / Capacity of each van
   Number of vans = 15 / 5
   Number of vans = 3

1. First, add the number of trays from both tables: 20 trays from the first table + 16 trays from the second table. This gives a total of 36 trays.
2. Next, since Luke can only carry 4 trays at a time, we need to divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry per trip: 36 trays รท 4 trays per trip.
3. The division results in 9, meaning Luke needs to make 9 trips to carry all the trays.

Therefore, the final answer is that Luke will make $\boxed{9}$ trips.</s>",9

                [/INST] Henry currently has 3 action figures and needs 8 in total. To find out how many more he needs, we subtract the number he already has from the total number he needs:

8 (total needed) - 3 (currently owned) = 5 (action figures needed)

Each action figure costs $6, so to find out how much money Henry would need to finish his collection, we multiply the number of action figures he needs by the cost of each one:

                [/INST] From the problem, we know that 9 people are adults (11 - 2 = 9). Each adult meal costs $8. So, multiply the number of adult meals by the cost per adult meal:

Cost for adult meals = Number of adults * Cost per adult meal
Cost for adult meals = 9 * $8
Cost for adult meals = $72

The cost for the kids is $0 as they eat for free. So, add the cost for adult meals to the cost for kids:

Total cost = Cost for adult meals + Cost for kids
Total cost = $72 + $0
Total cost = $72

Even though the kids ate for free, they still count as part of the group who paid for the meal. So, the final answer is still $72 for all the people to eat.

                    question:
                     Dave had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 20 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash? 
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of shirts Dave had to wash, which is the sum of short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts. Then we subtract the number of shirts Dave washed by the time school started from the total number of shirts to find the number of shirts he did not wash.

Step 1: Find the total number of shirts
Total shirts = Short sleeve shirts + Long sleeve shirts
Total shirts = 9 + 27
Total shirts = 36

Step 2: Find the number of shirts Dave did not wash
Shirts not washed = Total shirts - Shirts washed
Shirts not washed = 36 - 20
Shirts not washed = 16

So, Dave did not wash 16 shirts by the time school started.

The final answer is {16}.</s>",16

                [/INST] The chef has already cooked 7 potatoes and needs to cook 9. This means there are 2 potatoes left to cook. Each potato takes 3 minutes to cook.

To calculate the total time needed to cook the rest of the potatoes, multiply the number of potatoes by the time needed to cook each:

Time needed = Number of potatoes * Time per potato
= 2 * 3
= 6 minutes

Therefore, it will take the chef 6 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

                [/INST] The first step is to add the number of pictures Gwen took at the zoo and the number of pictures she took at the museum to find the total number of pictures she initially took.

41 (pictures at the zoo) + 29 (pictures at the museum) = 70 pictures

The next step is to subtract the number of pictures Gwen deleted from her initial total to find out how many pictures she still has.

70 (initial total) - 15 (deleted pictures) = 55 pictures

So, after deleting 15 pictures, Gwen still has 55 pictures from her vacation.

                [/INST] To determine the number of pieces of clothing that go into each of the small loads, we first need to find out how many pieces were not included in the first load of 32 pieces. 

We calculate the remaining pieces by subtracting the first load from the total amount of clothing:
\[ \text{Remaining pieces} = \text{Total pieces} - \text{First load pieces} = 59 - 32 \]
\[ \text{Remaining pieces} = 27 \]

Now, we need to split these 27 pieces into 9 equal loads. To find out how many pieces go into each small load, we divide the remaining pieces by the number of small loads:
\[ \text{Pieces per small load} = \frac{\text{Remaining pieces}}{\text{Number of small loads}} = \frac{27}{9} \]
\[ \text{Pieces per small load} = 3 \]

Therefore, each of the small loads can contain \boxed{3} pieces of clothing.</s>",3

                [/INST] First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jerry has made. He made 14 dollars from mowing lawns and 31 dollars from weed eating, so:

Will worked 8 hours on Monday and earns 8 dollars an hour. So, his earnings for Monday can be calculated as follows:
Earnings = Hours worked * Hourly rate
Earnings for Monday = 8 hours * $8/hour
Earnings for Monday = $64

Step 2: Calculate Will's earnings for Tuesday.
Will worked 2 hours on Tuesday and earns 8 dollars an hour. So, his earnings for Tuesday can be calculated as follows:
Earnings = Hours worked * Hourly rate
Earnings for Tuesday = 2 hours * $8/hour
Earnings for Tuesday = $16

Step 3: Add Will's earnings for Monday and Tuesday to find his total earnings for the two days.
Total earnings = Earnings for Monday + Earnings for Tuesday
Total earnings = $64 + $16
Total earnings = $80

So, the final answer is:
{The final answer is: Will made 80 dollars in those two days.}</s>",80

                [/INST] First, we start with the number of cupcakes Carol initially made, which is 19.

Then, she sold 6 of them, so we subtract those from the initial amount:

19 - 6 = 13

This means she had 13 cupcakes left.

After that, she made 27 more cupcakes. So, we add these to the remaining cupcakes:

13 + 27 = 40

1. First, we need to find out how many books Oliver is left with after the librarian takes 10 of them. We do this by subtracting the 10 books the librarian took from the total number of books.

Books left with Oliver = Total books - Books taken by librarian
= 46 - 10
= 36 books

2. Next, we need to determine how many shelves Oliver will need to put away these books. We do this by dividing the number of books by the number of books that can fit on each shelf.

Shelves needed = Books left with Oliver / Books per shelf
= 36 / 4
= 9 shelves

                [/INST] Luke had 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes, with each pile containing 3 coins.

First, let's find out how many coins are in the quarters' piles:

Coins in quarters' piles = Number of stacks * Coins per stack
                                      = 5 * 3
                                      = 15 coins

Next, let's find out how many coins are in the dimes' piles:

Coins in dimes' piles = Number of stacks * Coins per stack
                                    = 5 * 3
                                    = 15 coins

Now, we can add the number of coins in both the quarters' and dimes' piles to get the total number of coins:

Total coins = Coins in quarters' piles + Coins in dimes' piles
                    = 15 + 15

                [/INST] First, let's understand the information given:
1. For every 3 pounds of paper recycled, 1 point is earned.
2. Gwen recycled 5 pounds.
3. Her friends recycled 13 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the points earned by Gwen:
Pounds of paper recycled by Gwen = 5 pounds
Points earned by Gwen = Pounds of paper recycled by Gwen / Pounds needed for 1 point
= 5 / 3
= 1 remainder 2
So, Gwen earned 1 point and has 2 pounds left (not enough for another point).

Next, let's calculate the points earned by her friends:
Pounds of paper recycled by friends = 13 pounds
Points earned by friends = Pounds of paper recycled by friends / Pounds needed for 1 point
= 13 / 3
= 4 remainder 1
So, her friends earned 4 points and have 1 pound left (not enough for another point).

Finally, let's add up the points earned by both:
Total points = Points earned by Gwen + Points earned by friends

2. He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth.
3. To find out how many tickets he has left, subtract the number of tickets he spent from the total number of tickets he had.
   So, Tom has 40 - 28 = 12 tickets left.
4. Each ride costs 4 tickets. To find out how many rides Tom can go on, divide the number of tickets he has left by the cost of each ride.
   So, Tom can go on 12 / 4 = 3 rides.

                [/INST] The problem asks us to find the total number of cans Paul collected over two days. We know that he filled 6 bags on Saturday and 3 bags on Sunday, and each bag contained 8 cans.

To solve this, we first need to find the total number of bags Paul collected over the two days. We do this by adding the number of bags he collected on each day:

Total number of bags = Bags collected on Saturday + Bags collected on Sunday
= 6 + 3
= 9 bags

Next, we need to find the total number of cans Paul collected. We do this by multiplying the total number of bags by the number of cans in each bag:

Total number of cans = Total number of bags * Number of cans per bag
= 9 bags * 8 cans/bag
= 72 cans

So, Paul collected a total of 72 cans over the two days.

                [/INST] First, let's determine how many points Bianca earned.

Points Bianca earned = Total pounds Bianca recycled / Pounds needed for one point
                               = 24 pounds / 3 pounds
                               = 8 points

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many pieces of clothing Roger decided to split into 9 equal loads. Since he had 120 pieces in total and put 48 of them in one load, we subtract the 48 pieces he put in the first load from the total number of pieces of clothing.
   So, 120 - 48 = 72 pieces of clothing.

2. Now, we need to divide the remaining 72 pieces of clothing into 9 equal loads. To do this, we divide the number of remaining pieces of clothing by the number of loads.
   So, 72 / 9 = 8 pieces of clothing per load.

Therefore, each of the small loads will contain 8 pieces of clothing.

                [/INST] Certainly! Let's process this step-by-step.

**Step 1:** Calculate the total number of students who left during the year.
We know that 4 students left. So, the total number of students who left is:

4 (students)

**Step 2:** Calculate the total number of new students who joined during the year.
We know that 42 new students arrived. So, the total number of students who joined is:

42 (students)

**Step 3:** Calculate the total number of students at the end of the year.
At the end of the year, we'd subtract the students who left and add the ones who joined from the initial number of students. So, the calculation, using ""s"" to represent the students:

End students = s - left students + joined students
= 10 (initial students) - 4 (left students) + 42 (joined students)
= 10 - 4 + 42

**Step 4:** Complete the calculation to find the number of students at the end of the year.
End students = 10 - 4 + 42 = 48

So, the number of students in the fourth grade at the end of the year is:

Total number of players = Number of new players + Number of returning players
Total number of players = 12 + 44
Total number of players = 56

                    question:
                     Paige was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 6 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 5 scarves and 5 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Paige have total? 
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we start by calculating the number of scarves Paige has. Since there are 5 scarves in each box and she has 6 boxes, the total number of scarves is calculated as follows:
\[6 \text{ boxes} \times 5 \text{ scarves/box} = 30 \text{ scarves}.\]

Next, we calculate the number of mittens. Similarly, since there are 5 mittens in each box and she has 6 boxes, the total number of mittens is:
\[6 \text{ boxes} \times 5 \text{ mittens/box} = 30 \text{ mittens}.\]

To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we add the total number of scarves to the total number of mittens:
\[30 \text{ scarves} + 30 \text{ mittens} = 60 \text{ pieces of winter clothing}.\]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of winter clothing Paige has is $\boxed{60}$.</s>",60

                    question:
                     A chef needs to cook 12 potatoes. He has already cooked 6. If each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest? 
                [/INST] The chef has already cooked 6 potatoes, so he has cooked half the 12 potatoes he needs to cook. Therefore, he needs to cook only the other half, which is 6 potatoes. If each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, then the total time to cook the remaining 6 potatoes would be:

Time = Number of potatoes * Time per potato
         = 6
         = 36 minutes

{The final answer is} it will take him 36 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.</s>",36

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of games Luke sold: He started with 57 games and sold 39 of them. So, the number of games he had left is:
\[57 - 39 = 18\]

2. Determine how many boxes he needs to pack the remaining games: Since he packs 2 games into each box, the number of boxes needed is:
\[18 \div 2 = 9\]

Therefore, Luke had to use $\boxed{9}$ boxes to pack the remaining games.</s>",9
" April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was 3 dollars. If Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies, how much did she spend? ","<s>[INST]

                    question:
                     April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was 3 dollars. If Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies, how much did she spend? 
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the flowers Emily bought. 

1. First, we find the cost of one flower. Since each flower costs 3 dollars, the cost of one flower is $3.

2. Next, we calculate the cost of 2 roses. Since one rose costs $3, two roses would cost $3 \times 2 = $6.

3. Similarly, we calculate the cost of 2 daisies. Since one daisy costs $3, two daisies would cost $3 \times 2 = $6.

4. Finally, we add the cost of the roses and the daisies to find the total cost of the flowers Emily bought. The total cost is $6 (for the roses) + $6 (for the daisies) = $12.

Therefore, Emily spent $\boxed{12}$ dollars on the flowers.</s>",12

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to find out the total number of carrots Faye and her mom picked. They picked 23 and 5 respectively, so in total they picked 23 + 5 = 28 carrots.

2. Next, we know that only 12 of these carrots were good. So, the number of bad carrots would be the total number of carrots minus the number of good carrots. That is, 28 - 12 = 16 bad carrots.

So, the final answer is that they had 16 bad carrots. {The final answer is 16}</s>",16

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Isabel initially picked 66 flowers.
2. She plans to make bouquets with 8 flowers each.
3. However, 10 of the flowers wilted, leaving her with 66 - 10 = 56 flowers.

Now, to find out how many bouquets she can still make, we divide the remaining flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet:

56 flowers / 8 flowers per bouquet = 7 bouquets

So, {Isabel can still make 7 bouquets}.</s>",7

                     At the town carnival Oliver rode the ferris wheel 5 times and the bumper cars 4 times. If each ride cost 7 tickets, how many tickets did he use? 
                [/INST] First, we need to find out how many rides Oliver went on in total. He rode the ferris wheel 5 times and the bumper cars 4 times. Since these are separate activities, we add the number of times he did each one:

\begin{align*}
\text{Total rides} &= \text{Ferris wheel rides} + \text{Bumper cars rides} \\
&= 5 + 4 \\
&= 9
\end{align*}

Next, since each ride costs 7 tickets, we multiply the total number of rides by the cost per ride to find out how many tickets Oliver used:

\begin{align*}
\text{Total tickets used} &= \text{Total rides} \times \text{tickets per ride} \\
&= 9 \times 7 \\

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of games Ned bought:
   Total games bought = Games from friend + Games from garage sale
   Total games bought = 50 + 27
   Total games bought = 77

2. Subtract the number of games that didn't work from the total number of games bought to find out how many good games he ended up with:
   Good games = Total games bought - Games that didn't work
   Good games = 77 - 74
   Good games = 3

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of scarves and mittens. Since there are 4 scarves in each box and Zoe has 8 boxes, we can calculate the total number of scarves by multiplying the number of scarves per box by the number of boxes:

Total number of scarves = Number of scarves per box \* Number of boxes
Total number of scarves = 4 \* 8
Total number of scarves = 32

Similarly, we can find the total number of mittens by multiplying the number of mittens per box by the number of boxes:

Total number of mittens = Number of mittens per box \* Number of boxes
Total number of mittens = 6 \* 8
Total number of mittens = 48

To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we add the total number of scarves and mittens:

Total number of pieces of winter clothing = Total number of scarves + Total number of mittens
Total number of pieces of winter clothing = 32 + 48
Total number of pieces of winter clothing = 80

Therefore, Zoe has a total of 80 pieces of winter clothing.
