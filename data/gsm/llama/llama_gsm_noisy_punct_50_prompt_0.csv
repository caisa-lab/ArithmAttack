                    question:
                    Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning ; and bakes muffins for her friends every? day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market, daily for $2 per? fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the : farmers' market?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day.
Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

Step 2: Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. This means she consumes 3 eggs per day.

Step 3: Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. This means she uses 4 eggs per day for baking.

Step 4: To find the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks, subtract the number of eggs eaten for breakfast and used for baking from the total number of eggs laid:
16 eggs/day (laid) - 3 eggs/day (eaten) - 4 eggs/day (used for baking) = 9 eggs/day

Step 5: Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market. Since she sells the eggs fresh, she sells them by the egg, not in batches.

Step 6: The problem asks how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market. To find the answer, multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg:
9 eggs/day (sold) × $2/egg = $18/day

{The final answer is $18.}<|eot_id|>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.
#### 18"
