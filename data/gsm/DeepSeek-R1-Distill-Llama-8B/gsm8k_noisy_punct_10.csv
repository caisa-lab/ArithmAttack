                    Natalia ! sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she ; sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did ? Natalia sell altogether in ? April and May?
                


</think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how many clips Natalia sold in April and May. So, the problem says she sold clips to 48 friends in April. That means in April, she sold 48 clips. Got that down.

Then, in May, she sold half as many clips as she did in April. Hmm, half of 48. Let me calculate that. Half of 48 is 24, right? Because 48 divided by 2 is 24. So, in May, she sold 24 clips.

Now, the question is asking how many clips she sold altogether in April and May. So, I need to add the number of clips she sold in April and May together. April was 48, May was 24. Adding those gives me 48 + 24. Let me do the math: 48 plus 24 is 72. So, altogether, she sold 72 clips.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. April: 48. May: half of that is 24. Total: 48 + 24 = 72. Yeah, that seems correct.
</think>

Natalia sold 48 clips in April and half of that, which is 24, in May. Adding these together gives a total of 72 clips sold.

The final answer is {72}.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>","Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.
Natalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
I need to calculate Weng's earnings from babysitting.

First, determine her hourly rate, which is $12 per hour.

Next, find out how many hours she worked. She worked for 50 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, divide 50 by 60, which gives 5/6 of an hour.

Multiply her hourly rate by the hours worked: 12 * (5/6) = 10.

Therefore, Weng earned $10 from babysitting.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - **Hourly rate:** \$12 per hour
   - **Time worked:** 50 minutes

2. **Convert minutes to hours:**
   \[
   \text{Hours} = \frac{50}{60} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   \[
   \text{Earnings} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours} = 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10
   \]

                    question:
                    Betty is saving money for a ! new wallet ; which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money : she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. ; How much more money does Betty need to buy , the wallet?
                <think>
First, I need to determine the total amount Betty's family is contributing towards her new wallet.

Betty's parents are giving her $15.

Her grandparents are giving twice as much as her parents, so that's 2 × $15 = $30.

Adding these together, the total contribution from both her parents and grandparents is $15 + $30 = $45.

Betty already has half of the money she needs for the wallet. Since the wallet costs $100, half of that is $50.

Therefore, Betty needs an additional $100 - $50 = $50 to purchase the wallet.
</think>

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet.

**Given:**
- **Cost of the wallet:** \$100
- **Betty's contribution:** She has only half of the money she needs.
- **Parents' contribution:** \$15
- **Grandparents' contribution:** Twice as much as her parents' contribution.

**Step 1: Determine the total contribution from Betty's family.**
- **Parents:** \$15
- **Grandparents:** 2 × \$15 = \$30

**Step 2: Calculate the total family contribution.**
Total contribution = Parents' contribution + Grandparents' contribution
Total contribution = \$15 + \$30 = \$45

**Step 3: Determine how much money Betty has.**
Betty has half of the money she needs for the wallet.
If the wallet costs \$100, then half of that is:
Betty's money = \$100 / 2 = \$50

**Step 4: Find out how much more money Betty needs.**
Total needed for the wallet: \$100
Betty's current money: \$50
Money needed = \$100 - \$50 = \$50

**Final Answer:**
Betty needs \$50 more to buy the wallet.

{The final answer is \$50}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>","In the beginning, Betty has only 100 / 2 = $<<100/2=50>>50.
Betty's grandparents gave her 15 * 2 = $<<15*2=30>>30.
This means, Betty needs 100 - 50 - 30 - 15 = $<<100-50-30-15=5>>5 more.

"Julie is reading a ? 120-page book. ; Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many . pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Julie is reading a ? 120-page book. ; Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many . pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?
                 Okay, so I need to figure out how many pages Julie should read tomorrow. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Julie is reading a 120-page book. So, the total number of pages is 120.

Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages. That means she has already read 12 pages. To find out how many pages she has left, I subtract the pages she read yesterday from the total. So, 120 minus 12 is 108 pages remaining.

Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. Since she read 12 pages yesterday, today she read 2 times 12, which is 24 pages. So, today she read 24 pages. Now, I need to subtract this from the remaining pages after yesterday. So, 108 minus 24 gives me 84 pages left.

If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, then I need to find half of 84. Half of 84 is 42. So, Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the beginning: 120 total pages. She read 12 yesterday, so 108 left. Today, she read twice as much, so 24 pages, leaving 84. Then, half of 84 is 42. Yep, that seems right.
</think>

To determine how many pages Julie should read tomorrow, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Pages in the Book**: Julie is reading a 120-page book.

2. **Pages Read Yesterday**: She read 12 pages yesterday.

3. **Pages Read Today**: She read twice as many pages today as she did yesterday. 
   - Since she read 12 pages yesterday, today she read \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pages.

4. **Remaining Pages After Today**: Subtract the pages read today from the total pages.
   - Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read today
   - Remaining pages = \( 120 - 24 = 96 \) pages.

5. **Pages to Read Tomorrow**: Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow.
   - Pages to read tomorrow = Half of the remaining pages
   - Pages to read tomorrow = \( \frac{96}{2} = 48 \) pages.

**Final Answer**: Julie should read 48 pages tomorrow.

{The final answer is} 48 pages.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>","Maila read 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pages today.
So she was able to read a total of 12 + 24 = <<12+24=36>>36 pages since yesterday.
There are 120 - 36 = <<120-36=84>>84 pages left to be read.
Since she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, then she should read 84/2 = <<84/2=42>>42 pages.

                 {The final answer is}
</think><think>
First, I need to determine how many letters James writes each week. He writes two letters each week, and each letter is three pages long.

Next, I calculate the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year.

Then, I multiply the number of letters by the number of weeks to find the total number of letters written in a year. So, 2 letters multiplied by 52 weeks equals 104 letters.

Finally, I multiply the total number of letters by the number of pages per letter to find the total number of pages written in a year. Therefore, 104 letters multiplied by 3 pages per letter equals 312 pages.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of letters James writes each week:**
   
   - James writes **2 letters** each week.
   - Each letter is **3 pages** long.
   
   \[
   \text{Total pages per week} = \text{Number of letters per week} \times \text{Pages per letter} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ pages/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of weeks in a year:**
   
   - There are **52 weeks** in a year.

3. **Find the total number of pages written in a year:**
   
   - Multiply the total pages per week by the number of weeks in a year.
   
   \[
   \text{Total pages per year} = \text{Pages per week} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 6 \times 52 = 312 \text{ pages}

                    question:
                    Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There ? are only 25% as many ; green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?
                <think>
First, I identify the number of yellow flowers, which is given as 10.

Next, I calculate the number of purple flowers. Since there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow ones, I find 10 plus 80% of 10, which equals 18 purple flowers.

Then, I determine the total number of yellow and purple flowers by adding the yellow and purple counts: 10 + 18 = 28.

After that, I calculate the number of green flowers. It's stated that there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers together. So, I find 25% of 28, which is 7 green flowers.

Finally, I sum up all the flowers: 10 yellow + 18 purple + 7 green = 35 flowers in total.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Number of yellow flowers = 10
- Purple flowers are 80% more than yellow flowers.
- Green flowers are 25% of the total number of yellow and purple flowers.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of purple flowers.**
\[
\text{Purple flowers} = \text{Yellow flowers} + 80\% \text{ of Yellow flowers}
\]
\[
\text{Purple flowers} = 10 + 0.80 \times 10 = 10 + 8 = 18
\]

**Step 2: Find the total number of yellow and purple flowers.**
\[
\text{Total yellow and purple flowers} = 10 + 18 = 28
\]

**Step 3: Determine the number of green flowers.**
\[
\text{Green flowers} = 25\% \text{ of } 28 = 0.25 \times 28 = 7
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.**
\[
\text{Total flowers} = \text{Yellow flowers} + \text{Purple flowers} + \text{Green flowers}
\]
\[
\text{Total flowers} = 10 + 18 + 7 = 35
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{35}
\]<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>","There are 80/100 * 10 = <<80/100*10=8>>8 more purple flowers than yellow flowers.
So in Mark's garden, there are 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 purple flowers.
Purple and yellow flowers sum up to 10 + 18 = <<10+18=28>>28 flowers.
That means in Mark's garden there are 25/100 * 28 = <<25/100*28=7>>7 green flowers.
So in total Mark has 28 + 7 = <<28+7=35>>35 plants in his garden.

". Albert is wondering : how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices. If ? he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?","<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>

                    question:
                    . Albert is wondering : how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices. If ? he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?
                 . Albert is wondering how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices. If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?
Okay, so Albert wants to figure out how many pizza slices he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. Each large pizza has 16 slices, and each small one has 8 slices. He plans to eat all of it, so I need to calculate the total number of slices he has and then determine how many he eats.

First, let's break down the problem. Albert buys two types of pizzas: large and small. For the large pizzas, each has 16 slices, and he buys 2 of them. So, I can calculate the total slices from the large pizzas by multiplying the number of large pizzas by the number of slices per large pizza. That would be 2 times 16.

Wait, let me make sure I do that right. So, 2 times 16 is 32. Okay, so the large pizzas give him 32 slices.

Next, he buys 2 small pizzas. Each small pizza has 8 slices. So, similar to the large ones, I need to multiply the number of small pizzas by the number of slices per small pizza. That would be 2 times 8.

Calculating that, 2 times 8 is 16. So, the small pizzas add 16 more slices.

Now, to find the total number of slices Albert has, I need to add the slices from the large pizzas and the small pizzas together. So that's 32 slices from the large ones plus 16 slices from the small ones.

Adding those together: 32 plus 16 equals 48. So, Albert has a total of 48 pizza slices.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations. Two large pizzas at 16 slices each: 2*16=32. Two small pizzas at 8 slices each: 2*8=16. Total is 32+16=48 slices. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, if Albert eats all of it, he would eat all 48 slices. Therefore, the answer should be 48.

Hmm, is there any possibility I missed something? Maybe the problem is trying to trick me into thinking about the number of pizzas instead of the slices? But no, the question clearly mentions slices. So, I think 48 is the correct number of slices he eats.
</think>

Albert buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. Each large pizza has 16 slices, so 2 large pizzas provide 32 slices. Each small pizza has 8 slices, so 2 small pizzas provide 16 slices. Adding both together, the total number of slices is 32 + 16 = 48.

{The final answer is} 48 slices.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>","He eats 32 from the largest pizzas because 2 x 16 = <<2*16=32>>32

I need to determine the final weight of the box after all the additions.

First, Ken starts with an empty box, so the initial weight is 0 pounds.

He adds enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.

Then, he adds enough brownies to triple the current weight. Tripling 2 pounds gives 6 pounds.

Next, he adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans, bringing the total to 8 pounds.

Finally, he adds enough gummy worms to double the weight. Doubling 8 pounds results in a final weight of 16 pounds.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the final weight of the box.

1. **Initial Weight**: The box starts empty, so the initial weight is **0 pounds**.

2. **First Addition (Jelly Beans)**: Ken adds jelly beans to bring the weight to **2 pounds**.
   - Current Weight: \(0 + 2 = 2\) pounds

3. **Second Addition (Brownies)**: He adds brownies to triple the current weight.
   - Current Weight before adding brownies: **2 pounds**
   - Tripling the weight: \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds
   - Current Weight: \(2 + 6 = 8\) pounds

4. **Third Addition (Jelly Beans)**: He adds another **2 pounds** of jelly beans.
   - Current Weight before adding jelly beans: **8 pounds**
   - Addition: \(8 + 2 = 10\) pounds

5. **Fourth Addition (Gummy Worms)**: He adds gummy worms to double the current weight.
   - Current Weight before adding gummy worms: **10 pounds**
   - Doubling the weight: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) pounds
