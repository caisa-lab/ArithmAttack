                    question:
                    Janet’s : ducks lay 16 . eggs : per day. She ! eats three for breakfast : every ; morning and bakes muffins . for her ; friends every day with four. She sells ! the remainder at the farmers' market daily , for ; $2 per fresh duck ; egg. How much in dollars does . she make every day ? at ? the farmers' market?
                [/INST] Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins with 4 eggs for her friends every day. So, the total number of eggs she uses per day is 3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs.

The remaining eggs after her daily uses are 16 (total per day) - 7 (used) = 9 eggs.

She sells these remaining eggs at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. So, the amount she makes every day from selling the eggs is 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18.

Therefore, the final answer is: She makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.</s>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

                    A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. ,  ; How many . bolts ; in ; total . does it take?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of bolts required for a robe. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber.

Step 1: Determine the amount of white fiber required.
The problem states that the white fiber is half the amount of the blue fiber. So, if the blue fiber is 2 bolts, then the white fiber is:

White fiber = 1/2 * Blue fiber
= 1/2 * 2 bolts
= 1 bolt

Step 2: Add the bolts of blue and white fiber to find the total.

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
= 2 bolts + 1 bolt
= 3 bolts

So, the robe requires 3 bolts in total.

{The final answer is: 3}</s>","It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs.
Total cost = Cost of house + Cost of repairs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Step 2: Calculate the increased value of the house.
Increased value = Original value * 150%
Original value = Cost of house = $80,000
Increased value = $80,000 * 150% = $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000

Step 3: Calculate the selling price of the house.
Selling price = Increased value + Total cost
Selling price = $120,000 + $130,000 = $250,000

Step 4: Calculate the profit.
Profit = Selling price - Total cost
Profit = $250,000 - $130,000 = $120,000

The final answer is {Profit = $120,000}</s>","The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. James runs 3 sprints each practice.
2. He practices 3 times a week, so the number of sprints he does in a week is 3 sprints/practice * 3 practices/week = 9 sprints/week.
3. Each sprint is 60 meters long.
4. Therefore, the total distance James runs in a week is 9 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters/week.

                [/INST] Wendi feeds her 20 chickens a total of 160 cups of chicken feed each day, because each chicken gets 3 cups of feed three times a day. She feeds 15 cups to her flock in the morning, and another 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 40 cups that she dishes out in the morning and afternoon. To find out how many cups Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the 40 cups she has already given out from the total 160 cups.

160 cups total feed
- 40 cups feed in the morning and afternoon
= 120 cups feed remaining for the final meal of the day

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 120 cups of feed in the final meal of the day. {The final answer is 120 cups of feed.}</s>","If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.

2. Every second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass. So, the cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is $3.

3. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, he will buy 15 second glasses (as the first one goes without the discount).

4. So, the total cost for the 15 second glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

5. The first glass costs $5.

6. Therefore, the total cost for all 16 glasses is $45 (for the second glasses) + $5 (for the first glass) = $50.

The final answer is \boxed{50}.</s>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

                [/INST] First, let's start with the information given about Seattle. It is stated that Seattle has 20 sheep.

Next, we'll use the information about Charleston having four times as many sheep as Seattle. So if Seattle has 20 sheep, then Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Finally, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So if Charleston has 80 sheep, then Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now we can add up the number of sheep in all three cities to get the total number of sheep. The total number of sheep is 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260 sheep.

The final answer is \boxed{260}.</s>","If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep

1. Carla is downloading a 200 GB file.
2. Her normal download speed is 2 GB/minute.
3. She completes 40% of the download process.

The time taken to download 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time = Size / Speed = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

4. The remaining 60% of the file is not downloaded, so it's also 120 GB.
5. After 40 minutes, Windows forces a restart to install updates, taking an additional 20 minutes.
6. Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, so she downloads the entire 200 GB with her normal speed of 2 GB/minute.

Time taken to download the entire file:
Time = Size / Speed = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes
Total time taken = Time to download 40% + Time to install updates + Time to download 100%
Total time taken = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla a total of 160 minutes to download the file.
{The final answer is 160 minutes}</s>","First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = <<200*40*.01=80>>80 GB

Then find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes
Then add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<40+100+20=160>>160 minutes

How far is he from home : at the ; end of those 4 . hours?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate how far John travels during his initial 3-hour drive at 60 mph. The distance can be calculated with the formula: Distance = Speed * Time. In this case, it would be 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. Next, we need to calculate how far he travels during the 4 hours he spends trying to return home. This is a bit more complicated because it involves several segments.

3. During the first 2 hours of trying to return home, he's in standstill traffic, so he travels 0 miles in this time.

4. For the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drives at 30 mph. Using the same formula as before, the distance he travels in this time is 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

5. Finally, he drives the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph. Using the same formula, the distance he travels in this time is 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

6. Adding up all the distances he traveled during the 4 hours trying to return home, we get 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph for half an hour) + 120 miles (80 mph for the remaining 1.5 hours) = 135 miles.

7. At the end of the 4 hours, we need to subtract the distance he was initially away from (180 miles) from the distance he was at the end of the 4 hours (135 miles).

So, the final answer is the absolute value of the difference between these two distances, which is |135 miles - 180 miles| = 45 miles. Therefore, John is 45 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.</s>","When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home
He was only able to drive 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours in the first four hours
In half an hour he goes 30*.5=<<30*.5=15>>15 miles
He then drives another 2-.5=<<2-.5=1.5>>1.5 hours
In that time he goes 80*1.5=<<80*1.5=120>>120 miles
So he drove 120+15=<<120+15=135>>135 miles
So he is 180-135=<<180-135=45>>45 miles away from home

1. First, determine the number of regular hours Eliza worked, which are the first 40 hours.

Regular hours = 40

2. Next, determine how many overtime hours Eliza worked, which is the remaining time beyond the first 40 hours.

Overtime hours = Total hours - Regular hours
Overtime hours = 45 - 40
Overtime hours = 5

3. Now, calculate Eliza's earnings for her regular hours by multiplying her regular hourly rate by the number of regular hours.

Regular earnings = Regular hours * Regular hourly rate
Regular earnings = 40 * $10
Regular earnings = $400

4. Next, calculate Eliza's overtime pay by multiplying her regular hourly rate by her overtime rate, which is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, and then multiplying that result by the number of overtime hours.

Overtime pay = Overtime hours * (Regular hourly rate * Overtime rate)
Overtime pay = 5 * ($10 * 1.2)
Overtime pay = 5 * $12
Overtime pay = $60

5. Finally, add Eliza's regular earnings and her overtime pay to determine her total earnings for the week.

Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime pay
Total earnings = $400 + $60

                    Carlos is : planting a lemon tree. The ! tree ! will : cost $90 to ? plant. . Each year it will grow . 7 lemons, . which ! he can sell for $1.5 : each. It costs $3 a ! year to water and feed the ? tree. : How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the ; lemon , tree?
                [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. First, we need to understand that Carlos is incurring an initial cost to plant the lemon tree, which is $90. He will also incur a recurring cost of $3 per year to water and feed the tree.

2. Every year, the lemon tree grows 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each. So, the revenue generated by the lemon tree each year is 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5.

3. Now, let's consider the net profit Carlos makes each year. This is the revenue from selling the lemons minus the cost of watering and feeding the tree. So, the net profit is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year.

4. For Carlos to start earning money, the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree should be less than or equal to the money he earns from selling the lemons. In other words, we need to find the number of years it takes for the cumulative profit to reach $90, which is the initial cost of planting the tree.

5. Let's denote the number of years it takes for Carlos to start earning money as 'n'. The total cost after 'n' years would be the initial cost plus the cost of maintenance for 'n' years, which is $90 + $3n.

6. The total revenue after 'n' years would be the revenue from selling the lemons each year times the number of years, which is $10.5n.

7. For Carlos to start earning money, the total revenue should be greater than or equal to the total cost. So, we can set up the inequality $10.5n > $90 + $3n.

8. Solving this inequality gives us $7.5n > $90, which simplifies to n > 12.

9. Therefore, it takes more than 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is that it takes more than 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.</s>","He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5
He earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5
It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13

                [/INST] Let's break down the information given:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
2. She sold 2 times more to the red house than she did to the green house.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house.
4. She has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had initially as V.

According to the information:

1. V/3 were sold at the green house.
2. 2*(V/3) were sold at the red house.

After selling at the green and red houses, the number of vacuum cleaners left would be V - (V/3 + 2*(V/3)).

3. Half of the remaining vacuum cleaners were sold at the orange house. So, half of (V - (V/3 + 2*(V/3))) were sold at the orange house.

After selling at the orange house, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can write the equation as:

V - (V/3 + 2*(V/3)) - 0.5*(V - (V/3 + 2*(V/3))) = 5

Solving this equation will give us the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had.

The equation simplifies to:

2V/3 - V/6 = 5

Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fractions gives:

4V - V = 30

3V = 30

V = 30/3

V = 10

So, Melanie started with 10 vacuum cleaners.

{The final answer is 10.}</s>","First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10
Then add two to figure out how many vacuum cleaners she had before visiting the red house: 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12
Now we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we will calculate the number of students enrolled in each type of dance and then find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:
   - There are 20! students in total.
   - 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance.
   - So, 20% of 20! = 0.20 * 20! = 4! students.

2. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:
   - After contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance.
   - The number of remaining students after contemporary dance is 20! - 4!.
   - So, 25% of (20! - 4!) = 0.25 * (20! - 4!) students.

3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
   - The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
   - So, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20! - (4! + 0.25 * (20! - 4!)).

4. Calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
   - The percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is (number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance / total number of students) * 100%.

The final answer is the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, which we get by performing the calculations above.</s>","There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.
So, 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 students are enrolled in either jazz or hip-hop dance.
There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
This is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.

                [/INST] To determine which purchase would yield a greater profit at the end of the month, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each item based on their respective market predictions and compare them.

1. Calculate the profit for the jewelry:
   The jewelry market is expected to increase by 2.5%. Hence, the increase in value for the jewelry would be:
   Increase = Initial value × Increase percentage
   Increase = $5000 × 2.5%
   Increase = $5000 × 0.025
   Increase ≈ $125

2. Calculate the profit for the electronic gadgets:
   The electronic gadgets market is expected to increase by 1.2%. Hence, the increase in value for the electronic gadgets would be:
   Increase = Initial value × Increase percentage
   Increase = $8000 × 1.2%
   Increase = $8000 × 0.012
   Increase ≈ $96

3. Compare the profits:
   Comparing the profits, it's clear that the potential increase in value for the jewelry ($125) is greater than the potential increase for the electronic gadgets ($96).

The merchant should choose to buy the jewelry worth $5,000 to maximize his profit at the end of this month. The profit would be approximately $125.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to consider the movement of the trains in two dimensions, both eastward and northward. The distance covered by each train in two days is the result of the combined distances traveled in each direction.

To find the total distance covered by each train:

1. First, we need to determine the distances traveled by each train eastward and northward.
2. We know that both trains cover 80 miles westward on the first day.
3. On the second day, they travel northward, covering 150 miles.
4. Since the trains are traveling in a straight northeastward direction (45 degrees from the east and north), the distance traveled each day can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.
5. For the first day, the distance traveled by each train is 80 miles due east.
6. For the second day, the distance traveled by each train is 150 miles due north.
7. To find the total distance covered by each train in two days, we need to add the eastward and northward distances and then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the combined distance traveled in a straight line.
8. Therefore, the distance covered by each train is $\sqrt{(80^2 + 150^2)} = \sqrt{(6400 + 22500)} = \sqrt{28900} \approx 170$ miles.

So, {The total distance covered by each train in two days is $\mathbf{170}$ miles}.</s>","On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.
They also covered 150 miles/train * 2 trains = <<150*2=300>>300 miles together on the second day.
The combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles
The average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train

The weekly salary as a teacher is calculated by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours worked per week. In this case, Jill gets paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week as a teacher. So, her weekly salary as a teacher is:
$20/hour * 35 hours = $700

Step 2: Calculate the weekly salary as a coach.
Similarly, the weekly salary as a coach is calculated by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours worked per week. In this case, Jill gets paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week as a coach. So, her weekly salary as a coach is:
$30/hour * 15 hours = $450

Step 3: Calculate the total weekly salary.
The total weekly salary is the sum of the weekly salary as a teacher and the weekly salary as a coach. So, her total weekly salary is:
$700 (teacher) + $450 (coach) = $1150

Step 4: Calculate the annual salary.
The annual salary is calculated by multiplying the total weekly salary by the number of weeks worked per year. In this case, Jill works 50 weeks a year. So, her annual salary is:
$1150/week * 50 weeks = $57500

Final answer: Jill's annual salary is $57500.
{The final answer is $57500}</s>","First find the total amount Jill makes per week teaching: $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $<<20*35=700>>700/week

1. Claire eats an omelet every morning, which contains 3 eggs. So, she consumes 3 eggs per day.

2. We want to find out how many eggs she will eat in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

3. Since she eats 3 eggs per day, over 28 days she will eat 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

4. A dozen is 12 eggs. So, to find out how many dozens of eggs she will eat, we divide the total number of eggs by 12.

5. Therefore, 84 eggs divided by 12 equals 7 dozens.

So, the final answer is: \boxed{7} dozens of eggs.</s>","She eats 3 eggs every day and there are 7 days in a week so she eats 3*7 = <<3*7=21>>21 eggs a week

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Marissa has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour. So, she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours.

2. The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. So, she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

3. Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

4. Let's denote the remaining time she needs to walk the last 6 miles as T.

5. Since the average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, we can write the equation as 4 = 12 / (2 + T).

6. Solving for T gives us T = 2.

7. So, Marissa needs 2 hours to walk the remaining distance. Since the distance is 6 miles, her walking speed in the remaining distance would be 6 miles divided by 2 hours = 3 miles per hour.

\boxed{Thus, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 3 miles per hour for the remaining distance.}</s>","First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours

                [/INST] Here's the step-by-step reasoning to find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters after the spill:

1. First, let's find out how much water is in the original 10 liters of orange drink:
Two-thirds of the orange drink is water, so:
Water in orange drink = (2/3) * 10 liters = 20/3 liters

2. After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining amount of the orange drink is:
Remaining orange drink = 10 liters - 1 liter = 9 liters

3. Now, let's see how much water is in the 9 liters of the remaining orange drink:
Water in remaining orange drink = (2/3) * 9 liters = 6 liters

4. Next, let's find out how much water is in the original 15 liters of pineapple drink:
Three-fifths of the pineapple drink is water, so:
Water in pineapple drink = (3/5) * 15 liters = 9 liters

5. After adding the remaining 9 liters of the orange drink to the 15 liters of pineapple drink, the total amount of water in the new mixture is:
Total water = Water in pineapple drink + Water in remaining orange drink = 9 liters + 6 liters = 15 liters

6. The total volume of the new mixture after adding the remaining orange drink to the pineapple drink is:
Total volume = 15 liters (pineapple drink) + 9 liters (remaining orange drink) = 24 liters

7. Now, we can calculate the percentage of water in the 24-liter mixture:
Percentage of water = (Total water / Total volume) * 100% = (15 liters / 24 liters) * 100%

8. To find the actual amount of water in the 24-liter mixture, we multiply the total volume by the calculated percentage of water:
Actual amount of water = (24 liters) * (56.25%)

The final answer is:
{The final answer is 13.5 liters}

So, there are 13.5 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters.</s>","There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.

1. Raymond and Samantha are cousins. This information is not relevant to the problem and should be disregarded.

2. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. This means if Samantha is currently 31 years old, Raymond would be 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

3. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. This means the son would be 25 - 23 = 2 years older than Raymond.

4. Raymond's son is currently 2 years older than him. If Raymond is currently 25 years old, his son would be 25 + 2 = 27 years old.

5. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract his current age from 27. So, 27 years ago, Raymond's son was born.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Group of Customers**: The first group consists of 3 customers who each buy 1 DVD. So, the total number of DVDs sold to this group is calculated as:
   \[
   3 \text{ customers} \times 1 \text{ DVD/customer} = 3 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

2. **Second Group of Customers**: The second group consists of 2 customers who each buy 2 DVDs. Thus, the total number of DVDs sold to this group is:
   \[
   2 \text{ customers} \times 2 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 4 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

3. **Third Group of Customers**: The third group consists of 3 customers who don't buy any DVDs. Therefore, the number of DVDs sold to this group is:
   \[
   3 \text{ customers} \times 0 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 0 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

4. **Total DVDs Sold**: To find the total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday, we add the DVDs sold to each group:
   \[
   3 \text{ DVDs} + 4 \text{ DVDs} + 0 \text{ DVDs} = 7 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

Therefore, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

\[

1. First, we calculate the duration of the burning time:
From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a span of 4 hours.

2. Next, we multiply the burning time by the rate of meltage:
The candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour.

So, in 4 hours, the candle will be (4 * 2) = 8 centimeters shorter.

                [/INST] Let's denote the original price of the book as x.

Step 1: Understand that the original price was reduced by 25% to result in $19.50.

Step 2: Translate the text into an equation. Since the original price was reduced by 25%, we can write it as 0.75x = 19.50 (because 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).

Step 3: Solve for x. To find the original price, divide both sides of the equation by 0.75: x = 19.50 / 0.75.

Step 4: Calculate the result. x = 26.

{The final answer is} \boxed{26}</s>","Let X be the original price of the book. The discounted price is X - X*25% = $19.50.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered and then subtract that from the total amount she paid to find out how much she spent on pizza. After that, we can determine how many boxes of pizza she ordered.

1. Calculate the cost of the chicken meal: $12.00.
2. Calculate the cost of the milk: $3.00 per pack * 5 packs = $15.00.
3. Calculate the cost of the apples: $1.50 per apple * 4 apples = $6.00.

Now, add up the costs of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:

$12.00 (chicken meal) + $15.00 (milk) + $6.00 (apples) = $33.00.

Subtract this amount from the total amount Marie paid to find out how much she spent on pizza:

$50.00 (total paid) - $33.00 (cost of other items) = $17.00.

Now, divide the amount Marie spent on pizza by the cost of each box to find out how many boxes she ordered:

$17.00 / $8.50 per box ≈ 2 boxes.

However, since you can't order a fraction of a box, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

{The final answer is Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.}</s>","Five packs of milk cost $3 x 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
Four apples cost $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.5*4=6>>6.
The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $<<12+15+6=33>>33.
Thus, the boxes of pizza cost $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items Mishka bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of one pair of each item:
- One pair of shorts costs $16.50
- One pair of pants costs $22.50
- One pair of shoes costs $42

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for all the items in each category:
- The total cost for all the shorts is 3 (pairs) times $16.50 ($16.50 * 3)
- The total cost for all the pants is 3 (pairs) times $22.50 ($22.50 * 3)
- The total cost for all the shoes is 3 (pairs) times $42 ($42 * 3)

Now, we add up the total costs for all the items:
- Total cost = Shorts cost + Pants cost + Shoes cost

Let's calculate the total cost step by step:

Shorts cost = $16.50 * 3 = $49.50
Pants cost = $22.50 * 3 = $67.50
Shoes cost = $42 * 3 = $126

Total cost = $49.50 (Shorts) + $67.50 (Pants) + $126 (Shoes)
Total cost = $243

So, Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items.

1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, which can be represented as G + S = 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, which can be represented as G = S + 30.

To find the number of gold coins, we can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for S:

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate how much money John gets from selling all his Lego sets.
He has 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each, so he gets 13 * $15 = $195.

Step 2: Calculate how much money John spends on buying video games.
He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends 8 * $20 = $160.

Step 3: Calculate how much money John has left after buying the video games.
He initially had $195 and spent $160, so he has $195 - $160 = $35 left. But he ends up with $5, which means he used $35 - $5 = $30 to buy more games.

Step 4: Calculate how many Lego sets John still has.
He initially had 13 Lego sets and used $30 of the $195 to buy more games, which means he sold 13 * $15 / $30 = 5 Lego sets. Therefore, he still has 13 - 5 = 8 Lego sets.

The final answer is \boxed{8}.</s>","He spent $160 on video games because 8 x 20 = <<8*20=160>>160
He earned $165 from his sale because 160 + 5 = <<160+5=165>>165
He sold 11 lego sets because 11 x 15 = <<11*15=165>>165
He has 2 sets left because 13 - 11 = <<13-11=2>>2

                [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many hours John runs in a week.
John runs on three days a week for a total of 60 miles per week.

Step 2: We know he runs 3 times as much on the first day compared to the other two days. This means that he runs the total weekly distance in 3.5 days rather than 3.

Step 3: Let's denote the distance John runs on the first day as D. On the other two days, he runs D/2.
So, D + D/2 + D/2 = 60 miles.

Step 4: Solving this equation for D gives us D = 24 miles.

Step 5: Since John runs 24 miles on the first day and 12 miles on each of the other two days, he runs a total of 48 miles in 3.5 days.

Step 6: Now we can calculate his speed. Speed is distance divided by time.
The time John takes to run 48 miles is 3.5 days (assuming he runs exactly 3.5 hours each day).

Step 7: Convert days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3.5 days is 3.5 * 24 = 84 hours.

Step 8: Finally, calculate his speed. Speed = Distance / Time.
Speed = 48 miles / 84 hours = 0.5714…

Step 9: The question asks for his speed, so we leave the answer as a decimal.

\boxed{0.5714} miles per hour is John's running speed. {The final answer is} 0.5714 miles per hour.</s>","He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.
He runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.
So for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.
So in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.
So he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed**: Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run. Therefore, her running speed is twice her skipping speed.
   \[
   \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles/hour} = 6 \text{ miles/hour}
   \]

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed**: Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is four times slower than her running speed.
   \[
   \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles/hour}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles/hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time spent on each activity**: Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is 6 hours, we calculate the time spent on each activity.
   \[
   \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running**: Using the time spent running and the running speed, we calculate the distance.
   \[
   \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking**: Using the time spent walking and the walking speed, we calculate the distance.
   \[
   \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled**: Adding the distances from running and walking gives us the total distance.
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, Dana can travel a total of $\boxed{18}$ miles in six hours, spending one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.</s>","If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

                [/INST] First, let's break down the given information:
1. The dragon can breathe fire up to 1000 feet away.
2. The javelin can travel 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone.
3. With the sapphire gemstone, the javelin can travel 3 times farther than without.

Now, let's calculate how far the javelin can travel with the sapphire gemstone:
1. Without the sapphire gemstone, the javelin can travel 400 feet.
2. With the sapphire gemstone, the javelin can travel 3 times farther than without the gemstone.
3. Therefore, with the sapphire gemstone, the javelin can travel 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

However, the question asks how far outside of the dragon's flame range Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the javelin. The javelin must reach the dragon, so we need to find out how far the javelin can reach beyond the dragon's flame range.

1. The dragon's flame range is 1000 feet.
2. With the sapphire gemstone, the javelin can travel 1200 feet.
3. Therefore, beyond the dragon's flame range, the javelin can travel 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

Since Polly is holding the javelin, she can be standing 200 feet outside the dragon's flame range while still hitting the dragon.

Final answer: \boxed{200}</s>","With the gemstone, Polly could throw the javelin 3 times farther than 400 feet, for a distance of 3*400=<<3*400=1200>>1200 feet.

3. At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining.

4. To find the number of pieces taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. **Determine the calories per serving:** The bag of chips has 5 servings of 250 calories each. So, the total calories in the whole bag are:
   $$5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories}$$

2. **Calculate the remaining calories for the day:** Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories. You've already consumed 1800 calories, so the remaining calories you can consume are:
   $$2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories}$$

3. **Determine the number of servings you can eat:** Now, we need to find out how many servings of the bag of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving is 250 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:
   $$200 \text{ calories} / 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 0.8 \text{ servings}$$

4. **Convert servings to grams:** Finally, we need to find out how many grams of the bag of chips you can eat. Since each serving is 50 grams (300g bag / 6 servings), we multiply the number of servings you can eat by the grams per serving:
   $$0.8 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams/serving} = 40 \text{ grams}$$

So, you can eat 40 grams of the bag of chips based on your daily calorie target and your remaining calories.

Therefore, {The final answer is 40 grams}.</s>","If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat
If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams

                [/INST] To calculate Charlie's net profit from selling 20 tapered candles, we follow these steps:

1. **Determine the revenue from selling 20 candles**: Charlie sells each candle for $2.00. Therefore, the revenue from selling 20 candles is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = \text{Number of candles} \times \text{Price per candle} = 20 \times 2 = \$40.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of beeswax needed for 20 candles**: Since it takes 1 pound of beeswax to make 10 candles, the amount of beeswax needed for 20 candles is:
   \[
   \text{Beeswax needed} = \frac{\text{Number of candles}}{\text{Candles per pound of beeswax}} = \frac{20}{10} = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of wicks needed for 20 candles**: Each candle requires a wick, and the cost of wicks for one candle is included in the $10.00 cost for materials to make one candle. Since each pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, the cost for wicks for 20 candles is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of wicks} = 2 \times \$10.00 = \$20.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of materials**: The total cost includes the cost of beeswax and the cost of wicks:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of beeswax} + \text{Cost of wicks} = \$20.00 + \$20.00 = \$40.00
   \]

5. **Calculate the net profit**: The net profit is the revenue minus the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Net profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$40.00 - \$40.00 = \$0.00
   \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit from selling 20 tapered candles is $\boxed{\$0.00}$.</s>","1 pound of beeswax and the wick make 10 candles and he wants to make 20 candles so he needs 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 pounds of beeswax

3. This means she placed 220 Post-it notes on the cups of coffee, so she must have had 80 + 220 = 300 Post-it notes before placing them.

4. However, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining after placing them, so she must have had 300 - 23 = 277 Post-it notes altogether.

5. Since she only had 80 Post-it notes to start with, the package she purchased must have contained 277 - 80 = 197 Post-it notes.

Final answer: \boxed{197}</s>","Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.
Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.
And if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23
Subtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.

1. We know that John spent $200 on blue ties.

2. We also know that each blue tie costs $40.

3. To find out how many blue ties John bought, we divide the total amount he spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie: $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.

4. According to the problem, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

5. We know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. So, each red tie costs $40 * 1.5 = $60.

6. To find out how much John spent on red ties, we multiply the cost of each red tie by the number of red ties he bought: $60 * 10 = $600.

7. To find out the total amount John spent on both blue and red ties, we add the amount he spent on blue ties to the amount he spent on red ties: $200 + $600 = $800.

Therefore, John spent $800 on ties.

{The final answer is: \boxed{800}}</s>","He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties
So he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties
Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties

1 inch = 1/12 feet

So,
4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches

Now, we know that the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

Number of pieces = Total length / Length of each piece
                         = 48 inches / 6 inches
                         = 8 pieces

252 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 21 dozens

Next, we calculate how much money Lloyd makes from selling these eggs per day. We know that he sells them for $2 per dozen, so:

21 dozens * $2/dozen = $42

Finally, to find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

$42/day * 7 days/week = $294/week

                [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We know Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour from point 1 to point 4. However, we don't know the distance between these two points. Let's denote this distance as D miles.

2. The time taken to travel from point 1 to point 4 can be calculated using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. So, the time taken to travel from point 1 to point 4 is D/10 hours.

3. Now, Tom travels back at a rate of 6 mph. The time taken to travel back can be calculated using the same formula: Time = Distance / Speed. So, the time taken to travel back is D/6 hours.

4. To find the total time taken for the round trip, we add the time taken to travel from point 1 to point 4 and the time taken to travel back. So, the total time taken is D/10 + D/6 hours.

5. We don't have the exact value of D, but we can simplify the expression for total time taken. The least common multiple of 10 and 6 is 30, so we can rewrite the expression as (3D/30) + (5D/30) = 8D/30 hours.

So, the total time taken is 8D/30 hours. {The final answer is: 8D/30 hours}</s>","He was travelling at full speed for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the revenue the mechanic earned on Thursday. For truck tires, he charges $60 each and repaired 6 truck tires. So, the revenue from truck tires on Thursday is 6 * $60 = $

360. For car tires, he charges $40 each and repaired 4 car tires. So, the revenue from car tires on Thursday is 4 * $40 = $160. Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

2. Next, let's calculate the revenue the mechanic earned on Friday. He repaired 12 car tires, which at $40 each would give a revenue of 12 * $40 = $480. Since he didn't repair any truck tires on Friday, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

3. Finally, let's calculate how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue. We subtract the revenue from Thursday from the revenue from Friday, which gives us $480 - $520 = -$40. This means the mechanic actually earned $40 less on Friday than on Thursday.

So, the final answer is: The mechanic earned $40 less on the day with higher revenue. \boxed{-40}</s>","On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.

1. **Understanding the initial condition**: The Doubtfire sisters are currently driving home with 7 kittens adopted from the local animal shelter.

2. **Calculating the number of kittens for Patchy**: It's given that Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since there are 7 adopted kittens, Patchy has had $7 \times 3 = 21$ kittens.

3. **Calculating the number of kittens for Trixie**: Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

4. **Calculating the total number of kittens**: To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we add the adopted kittens, Patchy's kittens, and Trixie's kittens. This gives us $7 + 21 + 12$.

5. **Final calculation**: Adding these numbers together, we get $7 + 21 + 12 = 40$.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps:

1. First, let's calculate the amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year. Since there are 12 months in a year, half a year is 6 months. If she pays $140 per month, then for 6 months, she would pay:
   $140/month * 6 months = $840

2. Next, let's calculate the amount Aleena paid for the second half of the year. She pays 10% less in this period. So, the amount she pays per month for the second half is:
   $140 - ($140 * 10/100) = $140 - $14 = $126/month

3. For the second half of the year, she would pay for another 6 months, so:
   $126/month * 6 months = $756

4. Finally, to find the total amount she paid for the year, we add the two amounts together:
   $840 (first half) + $756 (second half) = $1596

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is {1596}.</s>","A year has twelve months, so a half of the year is 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 months,
For the first six months, the streaming service charged her a total of 6*140 = $<<6*140=840>>840
For the next half of the year, the streaming service company charged her 10/100*140 = $<<10/100*140=14>>14 less
She paid $140-$14 = $<<140-14=126>>126 each month for the remaining half of the year,
In total, she paid 126*6 = $<<126*6=756>>756 for the other half of the year for the streaming service.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the miles per gallon (MPG) of Sophia's car. We can do this by dividing the distance she has traveled since the last fill-up by the number of gallons she added to fill the tank.

1. Distance traveled since the last fill-up = 100 miles
2. Gallons added to fill the tank = 4 gallons

Now, let's calculate the MPG of the car:

3. MPG = Distance traveled / Gallons added
= 100 miles / 4 gallons
= 25 miles per gallon

To find out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we multiply the tank's capacity by the MPG:

4. Tank capacity = 12 gallons
5. Distance Sophia can drive on a single tank = MPG * Tank capacity
= 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons
= 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

Shiela bought five cell phones for $150 each. So, the total cost of the cell phones is 5 * $150 = $750

Step 2: Calculate the 2% interest on the total cost
The interest charged is 2% of the total cost. So, the interest is 0.02 * $750 = $15

Step 3: Determine the total amount to be paid for 3 months
Shiela is paying for the total cost of the cell phones plus the interest over 3 months. So, the total amount to be paid is $750 + $15 = $765

Step 4: Calculate the amount to be paid each month
The total amount to be paid is divided by number of months. So, the amount to be paid each month is $765 / 3 = $255

The final answer is: \boxed{255}</s>","A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.
So, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.
The total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.
Thus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much Artie would make from selling each type of flower at their usual prices.

- Marigolds: $2.74 per pot * 12 pots = $32.88
   - Petunias: $1.87 per pot * 9 pots = $16.83
   - Begonias: $2.12 per pot * 17 pots = $36.04

2. However, Artie has decided to round all prices to the nearest dollar. So, we need to round these prices:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
   - Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
   - Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

3. Now, let's calculate how much Artie would make from selling each type of flower at the rounded prices:

- Marigolds: $3 per pot * 12 pots = $36
   - Petunias: $2 per pot * 9 pots = $18
   - Begonias: $2 per pot * 17 pots = $34

4. Finally, we add up the amounts from each type of flower to find out how much Artie will make in total:

- Total earnings = $36 (marigolds) + $18 (petunias) + $34 (begonias) = $88

So, the final answer is:

{The final answer is $88}</s>","Artie will round his marigolds up from $2.74 to $3, since the number following the 2 is 5 or higher.
Artie will round his petunias up from $1.87 to $2, since the number following the 1 is 5 or higher.
Artie will round his begonias down from $2.12 to $2, since the number following the 2 is less than 5.
Artie sells 12 marigolds x $3 = $<<12*3=36>>36
Artie sells 9 petunias x $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18
Artie sells 17 begonias x $2 = $<<17*2=34>>34

                [/INST] To find the average square footage of a level of Luke's sandcastle, we first need to calculate the total square footage of all four levels, then divide by the number of levels (4).

Step 1: Calculate the square footage of each level.
- Level 1 has 16 square feet.
- Level 2 has half the size of level 1, so 16/2 = 8 square feet.
- Level 3 has half the size of level 2, so 8/2 = 4 square feet.
- Level 4 has half the size of level 3, so 4/2 = 2 square feet.

Step 2: Calculate the total square footage.
Total square footage = Level 1 + Level 2 + Level 3 + Level 4
Total square footage = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square feet

Step 3: Calculate the average square footage of a level.
Average square footage = Total square footage / Number of levels
Average square footage = 30 / 4

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. For the first 180 days, Cecilia has to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day. So, the total amount of dog food needed in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

2. The puppy then needs 2 cups of dog food every day for the remaining days of the year. Since the total number of days in a year is 365, the remaining days after the first 180 days are 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the amount of dog food needed in the remaining days is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

3. Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed in a year is 180 cups (for the first 180 days) + 370 cups (for the remaining 185 days) = 550 cups.

4. One bag of dog food contains 110 cups. So, the number of bags needed to meet the puppy's annual food requirement is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

So, Cecilia will use {5 bags} of dog food for the puppy in the first year.</s>","The number of cups of dog food given for the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = <<180*1=180>>180 cups

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

2. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can find the amount of laundry David does by dividing the amount Sarah does by 4.
   David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4 = 400 / 4 = \boxed{100} pounds of laundry.

3. We also know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, we can find the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing the amount Sarah does by 2.
   Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2 = 400 / 2 = \boxed{200} pounds of laundry.

4. Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does.
   Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry = 200 - 100 = \boxed{100} pounds.

So, the final answer is that the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds.</s>","If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does 1/2*400 = 200 pounds of laundry.
Sara also does 4 times as much laundry as David, meaning David does 400/4 = <<400/4=100>>100 pounds of laundry.
The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200-100 = <<200-100=100>>100 pounds

1. Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50.
2. He can also buy flowers in packages of 2 for $1.

We want to find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in each option:

1. Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
   - Vincent needs 6 packages (since 18/3 = 6).
   - Total cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15.

2. Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
   - Vincent needs 9 packages (since 18/2 = 9).
   - Total cost = 9 * $1 = $9.

Now, let's compare the costs to find out how much he saves:

1. Difference in cost = $15 (package of 3) - $9 (package of 2) = $6.

So, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price (packages of 2).

1. The cost of grooming is initially $100.
2. John is offered a 30% discount for being a new customer.
3. To find the amount of the discount, we calculate 30% of $100. This is done by multiplying $100 by 30/100, which equals $30.
4. To find the final cost of grooming, we subtract the discount from the initial cost. So, $100 - $30 = $70.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much water the two girls got in total. Since each of them got 1/6 of the total 24 liters, we calculate their combined share:

Water shared by the two girls = Total water * Share per girl * Number of girls
= 24 liters * 1/6 * 2
= 8 liters

2. Next, we subtract the total water shared by the girls from the initial total water to find out how much water is left before the boy gets his share:

Water left after girls share = Total water - Water shared by girls
= 24 liters - 8 liters
= 16 liters

3. Now, we know that the boy got 6 liters of water. So, we subtract this from the remaining water to find out how much is left:

Final remaining water = Water left after girls share - Boy's share
= 16 liters - 6 liters
= 10 liters

So, {10 liters} of water were left after the boy got his share.</s>","Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.

1. The football team played a total of 22 games.

2. They won 8 more games than they lost. Let's denote the number of games lost as L.

3. Therefore, the number of games won would be L + 8.

4. Since the total number of games played is 22, we can write the equation: L (number of games lost) + L + 8 (number of games won) = 22.

5. Simplifying this, we get: 2L + 8 = 22.

6. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us: 2L = 14.

7. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: L = 7.

8. Now, we can find the number of games won: L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Sylvie's initial annual salary is $600.

2. Every year, the company increases the salaries of employees by 10% of the initial salary. This increase happens only after five years of service.

3. Sylvie has been working for more than five years, so she will start receiving the 10% increase this year.

4. To calculate the new salary after the 10% increase, we multiply the initial salary by 1.10 (which represents a 10% increase):

New Salary = Initial Salary * 1.10
   = $600 * 1.10
   = $660

5. After three more years, Sylvie will continue to receive a 10% increase every year, but starting from the new salary of $660.

6. To find out what her salary will be after three more years, we need to repeat the process three more times:

Year 1: New Salary = $660 * 1.10 = $726
   Year 2: New Salary = $726 * 1.10 = $800.60
   Year 3: New Salary = $800.60 * 1.10 = $880.66

7. So, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will be $880.66.

{The final answer is $880.66}</s>","In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.

In three years, the total increase in her salary will be 3 years * $720/year = $<<3*720=2160>>2160

1. We know that Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Then, Marilyn sold 10H copies.

2. The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is 88,000. So, we can write this as:

H + 10H = 88,000

3. Combining the terms gives us:

11H = 88,000

4. Dividing both sides by 11 gives us:

H = 88,000 / 11

5. Simplifying that gives us:

H = 8,000

So, \boxed{8,000} copies were sold by Harald.</s>","Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.

                [/INST] The given question is about Lee's and Gerald's running times for a 400-meter hurdles race. Lee can run the race in 38 seconds, which is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's original time. Gerald then improves his speed by 10% through diet changes. We need to find Gerald's new time for the 400-meter hurdles race.

Step1: Determine Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles race.
Since Lee runs the race 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can represent Gerald's time as ""t"" seconds. Lee's time is 38 seconds, so t = 38 + 2.
t = 38 + 2
t = 40 seconds

Step 2: Calculate Gerald's improved speed.
Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find his new time, we first need to determine his original running time per meter. We can do this by dividing his original time (40 seconds) by 400 (the number of meters in the race).

Original running time per meter = t / distance
Original running time per meter = 40 seconds / 400 meters
Original running time per meter = 0.1 seconds per meter

Next, we apply the 10% increase in speed. An increase in speed corresponds to a decrease in time, so we subtract 10% of the original running time per meter.

Improved running time per meter = Original running time per meter - (10% * Original running time per meter)
Improved running time per meter = 0.1 seconds per meter - (0.1 * 0.1 seconds per meter)
Improved running time per meter ≈ 0.1 seconds per meter - 0.01 seconds per meter
Improved running time per meter ≈ 0.09 seconds per meter

Step 3: Calculate Gerald's new time for the 400-meter hurdles race.
Now that we have Gerald's improved running time per meter, we can find his new time for the 400-meter hurdles race by multiplying the distance by his improved running time per meter.

New time = Distance * Improved running time per meter
New time = 400 meters * 0.09 seconds per meter
New time = 36 seconds

The final answer is {Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles race in \boxed{36} seconds with his improved diet}.</s>","If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles, then Gerald initially would run the 400-meter hurdles in 38+2=<<38+2=40>>40 seconds.
10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.

1. We know that the number of cats is twice the number of dogs. Let's denote the number of dogs as D. Then, the number of cats is 2D.

2. We are given that the number of dogs is 60, so D = 60. Therefore, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

3. The problem also states that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, the number of rabbits is R = D + C - 12, where C is the number of cats. Substituting the values of D and C, we get R = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168.

4. Now, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together: Total = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348.

2. We know that 2/5 of these students are boys, so 2/5 * 200 = 80 students are boys.
3. This means that the rest of the students must be girls. So, 200 - 80 = 120 students are girls.
4. We're told that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, 2/3 * 120 = 80 girls are in the girl scout.
5. To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls. So, 120 - 80 = 40 girls.

Some . of , the cars ? drive through in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, then ? 20 more cars drive through : in the : remaining 15 minutes ; of the jam. 5 . cars ! from the : line ; take an exit so they don't have to ; drive through : the traffic jam. If ; there were originally 30 ; cars on the motorway, ; how ? many cars , drove through the ? traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. 5 cars take an exit and don't have to drive through the traffic jam.
3. This means that 30 - 5 = 25 cars are still on the motorway.
4. Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam.
5. Then 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam.

Since the 20 cars that drive through in the remaining 15 minutes are in addition to the cars that drive through in the first 15 minutes, it seems the question might be a bit confusing as it is. The information provided is not enough to determine exactly how many cars drive through in the first 15 minutes. We only know the final number of cars that drive through at two moments, not how many did so in each 15 minutes.

However, we can say that the total number of cars that drive through the traffic jam is the 25 cars that are still on the motorway minus the 5 that took an exit, which equals 20 cars. So, at least 20 cars drive through the traffic jam at some point during the 30 minutes.

Therefore, the final answer is: At least 20 cars drive through the traffic jam.</s>","The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
Most of the cars exited in the final 15 minutes so in the first 15 minutes, there must have been 25 total cars – 20 cars that drove through in the final 15 minutes = 5 cars that drove through the traffic jam.

1. Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of her 40 window ledges. So, she has a total of 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

2. She then receives 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. So, the total number of potted plants she now has is 80 + 18 = 98.

3. Mary decides to give away 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since she has 40 ledges, she will give away 40 potted plants.

4. Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is the total number of potted plants she has minus the number of potted plants she gives away. So, she will remain with 98 - 40 = 58 potted plants.

{The final answer is 58 potted plants.}</s>","Yesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants
After receiving an additional 18 plants, she therefore had a total of 80 + 18 = <<80+18=98>>98 potted plants
Tomorrow, Mary’s plant giveaway will be 40 *1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.
She will therefore remain with 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants.

Science textbook pages = 4
Social Studies textbook pages = 20
History textbook pages = 7
Geography textbook pages = 8

Total pages = Science textbook pages + Social Studies textbook pages + History textbook pages + Geography textbook pages
Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8
Total pages = 39

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so we need to subtract these from the total pages left to read.

Pages left to read = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Pages left to read = 39 - 15
Pages left to read = 24

Now, Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading. To find the number of pages he needs to read on average per day, we divide the pages left to read by the number of days left.

Average pages per day = Pages left to read / Number of days left
Average pages per day = 24 / 4
Average pages per day = 6

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day to complete all his reading in 4 days.

The final answer is {6 pages per day}.</s>","Solo has to read a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = <<4+20+7+8=39>>39 pages.

1. First, let's identify the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays. He drinks one glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which adds up to 3 glasses per day. Additionally, he drinks one more glass before he goes to bed. So, in total, he drinks 4 glasses of water on weekdays.

2. Next, let's find out how many glasses of water he drinks on weekends. He doesn't drink any water with dinner on weekends, so he only has one glass of water before he goes to bed.

3. Now, let's calculate the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he drinks 4 glasses of water each day, which equals 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays. On weekends, there are 2 days, and he drinks one glass of water each day, which equals 1 * 2 = 2 glasses of water on weekends. So, in a week, John drinks 20 + 2 = 22 glasses of water.

Quarter of 1000 pieces = 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces

Now, we subtract the pieces that Poppy has placed from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces are left.

1000 - 250 = 750 pieces

Then, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces.

A third of 750 pieces = 750 / 3 = 250 pieces

We subtract the pieces that Poppy's mom has placed from the remaining pieces to find out how many pieces are left.

750 - 250 = 500 pieces

So, there are 500 pieces left to be placed.

{The final answer is 500 pieces}</s>","Poppy has placed 1000 pieces / 4 = <<1000/4=250>>250 pieces.

The volume of a rectangular box is given by the formula:
Volume = Length * Width * Height

For one box:
Length = 5 inches
Width = 6 inches
Height = 4 inches

Volume = 5 inches * 6 inches * 4 inches = 120 cubic inches

Since there are three boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3:

Total inner volume of all 3 boxes = 120 cubic inches * 3 = 360 cubic inches

2. On Thursday, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. So, he watched 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours of TV on Thursday.

4. The total time Frankie watched TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 (from Monday and Tuesday) + 1.5 (from Thursday) + 2 (from Friday) = 5.5 hours.

5. Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

6. On Wednesday, Frankie watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. To find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched, we divide the total time he spent watching TV on Wednesday by the length of one episode. So, he watched 1.5 / 0.5 = 3 episodes.

1. Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. This means if we denote the number of cookies he made last year as ""x"", this year he wants to make 2x cookies.

2. After baking, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. This means he initially planned to bake 2x - 15 cookies.

3. He drops 5 cookies. So, the equation now becomes: 2x - 15 - 5 = 110 (since he has 110 cookies left after dropping 5).

4. Solving the equation: 2x - 20 =

110. This simplifies to 2x = 130, and finally, x = 130 / 2 = 65.

So, the final answer is:

\boxed{65}</s>","Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.

1. **Calculate the initial cost of the gas without the cashback**: The cost of one gallon of gas is $3.00. If someone were to buy 10 gallons, the total cost would be:
   \[
   \text{Initial Cost} = \text{Cost per Gallon} \times \text{Number of Gallons} = \$3.00 \times 10 = \$30.00

2. **Calculate the cashback amount**: The app company offers $0.20 cashback per gallon. For 10 gallons, the total cashback would be:
   \[
   \text{Cashback} = \text{Cashback per Gallon} \times \text{Number of Gallons} = \$0.20 \times 10 = \$2.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the final cost after applying the cashback**: To find out how much the person would pay after receiving the cashback, subtract the total cashback from the initial cost:
   \[
   \text{Final Cost} = \text{Initial Cost} - \text{Cashback} = \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00
   \]

Therefore, after receiving the cashback rewards, the person would pay {The final answer is \$28.00} for 10 gallons of gas.</s>","Gas is $3.00 a gallon and they buy 10 gallons of gas so that's 3*10 = $<<3*10=30.00>>30.00

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice had.
Beatrice's roll-ups were 24 rolls long and 2 wide. The total number of fruit roll-ups is calculated by multiplying the length by the width:
Total roll-ups = Length * Width
= 24 * 2
= 48

Step 2: Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had.
Marcell's roll-ups were 14 rolls long and 3 wide. The total number of fruit roll-ups is calculated by multiplying the length by the width:
Total roll-ups = Length * Width

Step 4: Calculate the total number of people.
Total people = 2 (Marcell and Beatrice)

Step 5: Calculate the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten per person.
Average = Total roll-ups / Total people

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Julia's boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows.

2. She rows 20 feet. So, the amount of water she took on during this row can be calculated as follows:
   Water (liters) = (2 liters / 10 feet) * 20 feet

3. She rows for a total of 16 seconds and the shore is 64 seconds away. So, she rows for:
   Time rowed = 20 feet / (64 seconds / 80 feet) = 16 seconds

4. Now, we know she rowed for 16 seconds and took on a certain amount of water. The amount of water per second can be calculated as follows:
   Water per second = (2 liters / 10 feet) * (20 feet / 16 seconds)

5. Finally, to find out how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached shore, we multiply the amount of water per second by the total time rowed (16 seconds):
   Total water = Water per second * 16 seconds

After following each step, we find that the boat had taken on approximately 80 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore.

{The final answer is: The boat had taken on approximately 80 liters of water.}</s>","It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.
Thus, she had to row 20 * 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 feet back to shore.
In those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.
Thus, the boat had taken on 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

If she . sells ; them all, how much profit does she ? make?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the price of the leftover 2x4x10 boards after the 50% increase. Since the price went up by 50%, the new price is the original price plus 50% of the original price.
   New price of 2x4x10 boards = Original price + (Original price * 50%)
   = $10 + ($10 * 0.5)
   = $10 + $5
   = $15

2. Now, we can calculate the total cost of the leftover 2x4x10 boards. There are ten such boards:
   Total cost of 2x4x10 boards = Price per board * Number of boards
   = $15 * 10
   = $150

3. Next, we need to calculate the new price of the 4x4x10 boards after the 50% increase.
   New price of 4x4x10 boards = Original price + (Original price * 50%)
   = $16 + ($16 * 0.5)
   = $16 + $8
   = $24

4. We can then calculate the total cost of the five 4x4x10 boards:
   Total cost of 4x4x10 boards = Price per board * Number of boards
   = $24 * 5
   = $120

5. Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the boards:
   Total cost = Total cost of 2x4x10 boards + Total cost of 4x4x10 boards
   = $150 + $120
   = $270

6. Sasha sells all the boards. The total revenue from selling all the boards is the sum of the selling price of each board (which is the new price since the prices have gone up).
   Total revenue = (Number of 2x4x10 boards * New price of 2x4x10 boards) + (Number of 4x4x10 boards * New price of 4x4x10 boards)
   = (10 * $15) + (5 * $24)
   = $150 + $120
   = $270

7. Finally, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.
   Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   = $270 - $270
   = $0

So, the profit Sasha makes, after selling all the boards, is {The final answer is $0}.</s>","She bought the 2 x 4s for $100 because 10 x 10 = 100
She bought the 4 x 4s for 80 because 5 x 16 = 80

The same number now sells for $270 because 180 x 1.5 = <<180*1.5=270>>270

                [/INST] First, let's find the ratio of sugar to water. The ratio given is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water.

Next, let's denote the amount of sugar as S and the amount of water as W. We know that the total amount of sugar is 120 teaspoons and the total amount of water is unknown.

So, we have the equation: S = 120 (since the total amount of sugar is given).

We also have the ratio equation: S/W = 7/13.

We can rewrite the ratio equation as: 120/W = 7/13.

Solving this equation for W gives: W = 120*13/7 = 2040/7 = 292 cups of water.

Now, we want to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar. Since the ratio of sugar to water is given in teaspoons to cups, and they are directly related, we can assume that one teaspoon of sugar corresponds to 1/13 of a cup of water (since the ratio ratio is 7:13).

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar is equal to the total amount of sugar divided by the amount of sugar per teaspoon.

The amount of sugar per teaspoon is equal to the total amount of water divided by the total ratio of sugar to water, which is 292 cups / 7 = 41.72 cups per teaspoon.

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar is 120 teaspoons / 1 = \boxed{120}.

The final answer is 120 teaspoons of sugar.</s>","The total ratio representing the ingredients she used to make the coffee is 7+13 = <<7+13=20>>20

                [/INST] Lef's first determine Adrien's salary four years ago. Let's call it A.

A was the base salary that Adrien was making four years ago.

According to the question, after four years, Adrien's base salary increased by 30% (to cover the initial 30% higher), and his salary increased again by 40%. So, we multiply A by 1.3 (which is the same as a 30% increase) and then by 1.

40 (which is the same as a 40% increase) to find his new salary: 

A * 1.3 * 1.4 = Adrien's new salary

Now we know that this new salary is $40,000, which means:

$40,000 = A * 1.3 * 1.4

Solving for A, we get:

A = $40,000 / (1.3 * 1.4) = $22,216 (approximately)

Next, let's find Lylah's salary. Let's call it L.

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, which means:

A = 1.3 * L

L = A / 1.3
L = $22,216 / 1.3
L = $17,089 (approximately)

So far, we know that:

Adrien's salary four years ago was $22,216 (approximately)

Adrien's salary four years later is $40,000

Lylah's salary four years ago was $17,089 (approximately)

Now, let's assume that Lylah's salary also increased by 30% after four years. We multiply L by 1.3 to get Lylah's new salary:

L * 1.3 = Lylah's new salary

Lylah's new salary = $17,089 * 1.3 = $22,231 (approximately)

Finally, to find the total salary the two were receiving four years later, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries together:

$40,000 + $22,231 = $62,231 (approximately)

So, the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is approximately $62,231.

{The final answer is $62,231}</s>","Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.
In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000
After receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200
In total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.

1. Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week.

2. Each pad contains 30 sheets of paper.

3. There are 4 weeks in a month.

First, we need to find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a week. Since he uses 2 pads and each pad contains 30 sheets, we multiply the number of pads by the number of sheets per pad:
   Weekly sheets of paper = Pads used per week * Sheets per pad
   = 2 * 30
   = 60 sheets

Next, we need to find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of weekly sheets by the number of weeks in a month:
   Monthly sheets of paper = Weekly sheets of paper * Weeks per month
   = 60 * 4
   = 240 sheets

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

2. Kael brought twice the amount of apples Morisette brought, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples.

3. Kael brought half the number of oranges Morisette brought, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

4. So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

5. To find the total number of fruits they both brought, we add the fruits brought by Morisette and Kael, which is 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.

The final answer is \boxed{27}.</s>","Kael brought 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 apples.
And he also brought 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.

1. Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.
2. For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less each day because she had to complete some assignments. So, the hours she slept these two days would be: 8 hours - 2 hours = 6 hours on Tuesday and the same on Wednesday.
3. The total hours she slept during these two days would be: 6 hours + 6 hours = 12 hours.
4. For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than those two days. So, the hours she slept each of these days would be: 6 hours + 1 hour = 7 hours.
5. The total hours she slept during these four days would be: 7 hours/day * 4 days = 28 hours.
6. To find the total hours she slept throughout the week, we add the hours she slept from Monday to Wednesday and the hours she slept from Thursday to Sunday: 12 hours (Monday to Wednesday) + 28 hours (Thursday to Sunday) = 40 hours.

So, the final answer is: {Sadie slept a total of 40 hours throughout the week.}</s>","If on Monday she slept 8 hours, then she slept 8-2 = <<8-2=6>>6 hours on each of the next two days.

If she slept 1 hour more for the rest of the week each day, then each day she slept 6+1 = <<6+1=7>>7 hours.
The total for the rest of the week will be 4*7 = <<4*7=28>>28 hours.

                [/INST] To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we have to account for the time she runs at different speeds. Initially, Rosie runs for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour. After these 3 hours, she changes her speed to 5 miles per hour and continues to run for the remaining time.

1. First, calculate the distance Rosie covers in the first 3 hours at 10 miles per hour.

Mathematically, we can express this as:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

2. Next, calculate the remaining time Rosie spends running at 5 miles per hour. Since the total time is 7 hours and she runs for the first 3 hours at a different speed:

\[ \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent at 10 mph} \]
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

3. Then, calculate the distance Rosie covers in the remaining time at 5 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

4. Finally, add the distances from both time periods to get the total distance Rosie covers:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

{The final answer is: 50 miles}</s>","For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs 10 miles per hour, so she runs 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 miles.
However, she still has 7-3=<<7-3=4>>4 hours left to room.
For the next 4 hours, she runs 5 miles per hour, so she runs 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 miles.
In total she runs 30+20=<<30+20=50>>50 miles.

1. Jennie starts with 60 letters needing stamps and a pile of already stamped letters.
2. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps.
3. Now there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

Let's denote the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began as X.

When Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she stamps (1/3) * 60 = 20 letters. So, the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps is X + 20.

According to the problem, after Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. So, we have the equation:

X + 20 = 30

To solve for X, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

X = 30 - 20

X = 10

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: \boxed{10}</s>","She stamped 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 letters.

Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?

Step 1: We know that Julia used 3 spoons for sampling and had a total of 12 spoons. So, before using the spoons for sampling, she had 12 + 3 = 15 spoons.

Step 2: Julia's husband also bought 5 spoons, so before he bought the spoons, Julia had 15 - 5 = 10 spoons.

2. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

3. An orange costs $5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

4. Dillon has to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.

                [/INST] To calculate the profit the hospital makes, we need to consider both the revenue from the doctors' fees and the expenses involved. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total time spent by all patients:**
   Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, and there are 500 patients seen in a day. So, the total time spent by all patients is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 24 \, \text{minutes/patient} \times 500 \, \text{patients} = 12,000 \, \text{minutes}
   \]

2. **Convert the total time into hours:**
   Since doctors charge per hour, we need to convert the total time into hours:
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{12,000 \, \text{minutes}}{60 \, \text{minutes/hour}} = 200 \, \text{hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the revenue from doctors' fees:**
   The doctors charge $150 per hour. Therefore, the total revenue from doctors' fees is:
   \[
   \text{Revenue from doctors} = 200 \, \text{hours} \times \$150/\text{hour} = \$30,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the expenses for doctors' fees:**
   The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour. Therefore, the total expenses for doctors' fees are:
   \[
   \text{Expenses for doctors} = 200 \, \text{hours} \times \$200/\text{hour} = \$40,000
   \]

5. **Calculate the profit:**
   The profit is the difference between the revenue from doctors' fees and the expenses for doctors' fees:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue from doctors} - \text{Expenses for doctors} = \$30,000 - \$40,000 = -\$10,000
   \]

Therefore, the hospital actually has a loss of \$10,000 from these visits.

As clearly indicated, the hospital does not make a profit but incurs a loss. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{The hospital incurs a loss of } \$10,000.}

3. After these elves quit, we have:

1. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
2. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
3. Afterward, each of them decided to ride the luge 2 times.

First, we need to calculate the total number of rides each of them took:

Pam's rides = 2 (roller coaster) + 2 (luge) = 4 rides
Fred's rides = 4 (roller coaster) + 2 (luge) = 6 rides

Now, we calculate the total number of tickets they used:

Pam's tickets = 4 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 24 tickets
Fred's tickets = 6 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 36 tickets

Finally, we add both their tickets to find the total number of tickets used that day:

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of car washes Tom gets in a year. We know that there are 12 months in a year and Tom gets 4 car washes a month. So,

Total car washes in a year = Number of car washes per month * Number of months in a year
= 4 car washes * 12 months
= 48 car washes

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Tom pays for these car washes. We know that each car wash costs $15. So,

Total amount paid = Cost per car wash * Total number of car washes
= $15 * 48 car washes
= $720

Therefore, Tom pays $720 per year for car washes.

1. We know there are 27 unicorns in the world.
2. One third of these are in the Scottish Highlands. So, to find out how many that is, we divide the total number of unicorns by 3.
   Number of Scottish unicorns = Total number of unicorns / 3

   = 9 unicorns

3. Now, we know that two thirds of these Scottish unicorns are female. So, to find out how many female Scottish unicorns there are, we first find out what one third of the Scottish unicorns are, and then we double that to get two thirds.
   One third of Scottish unicorns = Number of Scottish unicorns / 3

Since Mark took the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour for 8 hours, he completed 5*8 = 40 questions.
Since he took the second test at a rate of 5 questions per hour for 6 hours, he completed 5*6 = 30 questions.

Step 2: Determine the number of questions he attempted on each test.
Since the first test had 75 questions and he completed 40, he attempted 75-40 = 35 questions.

We start by adding the number of automatic and manual cars:
12 (automatic cars) + 4 (manual cars) = 16

Since there are 20 cars in total, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total to find out how many are semi-automatic:
20 (total cars) - 16 (automatic and manual cars) = 4 (semi-automatic cars)

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and then multiply by 100:
(4 (semi-automatic cars) / 20 (total cars)) * 100 = 20%

So, the final answer is {20%}.</s>","12 + 4 = <<12+4=16>>16 cars are either automatic or manual.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Let B represent the number of baby bees, Q represent the number of queens, and W represent the number of worker bees.

2. From the problem, we know that there are 700 bees in total, so B + Q + W = 700.

3. We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees (so W = 2B) and twice as many babies as queens (so B = 2Q).

4. Now, let's substitute the expressions from steps 3 into the equation from step 2: 2Q + Q + 2B = 700.
5. Since B = 2Q, we can further simplify the equation to: 2Q + Q + 2(2Q) = 700, which gives us 6Q = 700.
6. Solving for Q, we find that Q = 116.75. However, since we can't have a fraction of a bee, let's round down to the nearest whole number, which is 116.
7. Now, using the same logic as in step 3, we can find the number of baby bees by using the equation B = 2Q. So, B = 2 * 116 = 232.
8. Finally, using the equation W = 2B, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2 * 232 = 464.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of light bulbs and roach traps. These are the items that are subject to tax.
The cost of light bulbs = 3 dollars * the number of light bulbs (unspecified)
The cost of roach traps = 4 dollars * the number of roach traps (unspecified)

Step 2: Calculate the tax on the light bulbs and roach traps. The tax is 10% of the total cost, so:
Tax on light bulbs = 10/100 * (cost of light bulbs)
Tax on roach traps = 10/100 * (cost of roach traps)

Step 3: Add the original cost of light bulbs and roach traps to their respective taxes to get the total cost of these items.
Total cost of light bulbs = cost of light bulbs + tax on light bulbs
Total cost of roach traps = cost of roach traps + tax on roach traps

Step 4: Add the total cost of light bulbs, roach traps, milk, eggs, and cups to get the final total cost.
Final total cost = total cost of light bulbs + total cost of roach traps + cost of milk + cost of eggs + cost of cups

Without the exact numbers of light bulbs, roach traps, milk, eggs, and cups, we can't calculate a specific dollar amount. However, the process of reaching the final cost, following the given conditions, would follow the steps above.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the expenses for each client. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost of each bottle of bleach is $2 and the cost of each pack of cloths is $5. So, the cost of cleaning for one client is:

Cost = Cost of bleach + Cost of cloths
= (2 * $2) + $5
= $4 + $5
= $9

Next, let's calculate the total expenses for all current and potential clients. Kim has 3 current clients and he is confident about his other 5 potential clients. So, he has a total of 3 + 5 = 8 clients. Therefore, his total expenses are:

Total Expenses = Number of clients * Cost per client
= 8 * $9
= $72

Now, let's calculate the profit. The profit is the difference between the total income and the total expenses. Kim's total income is $92. So, his profit is:

Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
= $92 - $72
= $20

Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.

{The final answer is \boxed{20}}</s>","Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.
Each week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.
Each week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.
The bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.
The packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.
His profit will therefore be $92 total income - $72 total expenses = $<<92-72=20>>20.

He'd dumped a lego ! boxed , set with 500 : pieces on the : floor, ? and another one that had 3 times more ! pieces ! than ; the 500 piece ! one, and another one that had 1/4 , the number of pieces. ;  How many blocks does Johnny . pick up if . he : picks up all the legos?
                [/INST] Step 1: Identify the number of pieces in each lego box.
The first box has 500 pieces, the second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, and the third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one.

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces in the second and third boxes.
The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

Step 3: Add up the total number of pieces.
Johnny picks up all the legos, so the total number of pieces is 500 (from the first box) + 1500 (from the second box) + 125 (from the third box) = 2125 pieces.

Step 4: Make the final answer clear.
{The final answer is \boxed{2125} pieces.}</s>","The first set had 500 pieces, and the second set had 3 times as many as the first set, so the second set has 500*3=<<500*3=1500>>1500 pieces
The third set had one-quarter of the 500 pieces, so that means it had 500*.25= <<500*.25=125>>125 pieces
In total, that means Johnny picked up 500 + 1500+ 125= <<500+1500+125=2125>>2125 blocks

1. Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. She then sees half that number, or 15 bees, return in the next 6 hours.
3. The number of bees that leave the hive in the next 6 hours is twice the number that left initially, so 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the final 6 hours, all the bees that left before and hadn't already returned come back. So, the total number of bees that come back in the last 6 hours is the sum of the bees that left in the first and second periods, which is 30 + 15 = 45 bees.

So, Debra saw \boxed{45} bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.</s>","Debra first sees 30 bees leave the hive, then sees 1/2 that many return, 30 x 1/2 = <<30*1/2=15>>15 bees that return and 15 bees that are still away from the hive.
Debra sees twice as many bees as first left the hive--which was 30--fly from the hive in the next 6 hours, 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bees that leave the hive.
In total, 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 bees left the hive.
There were 90 bees total that left the hive - 15 bees that already returned = <<90-15=75>>75 bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

1. The cost of admission for an adult is $12 and for a child is $10.

2. Brittany and her mom are two people going to the museum, so there is 1 adult (Brittany) and 1 child (Brittany's mom).

3. The total cost for one adult and one child's tickets would be $12 + $10 = $22.

4. If Brittany's mom gave the cashier some money and received $8 in change, it means she gave more than $22.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we first need to determine how long it takes for Steve and Tim to get home from school.

For Steve:
1. He lives 3 miles or 3*5280=15840 feet (1 mile = 5280 feet) away from the school.
2. His biking speed is 440 feet per minute.
3. So, it will take him 15840 / 440 = 35.995 minutes (approximately) to reach his home.

For Tim:
1. He lives 2 miles or 2*5280=10560 feet away from the school.
2. His skateboarding speed is 264 feet per minute.
3. So, it will take him 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes to reach his home.

Now, we need to determine who wins and the time difference between their arrival times.

Since Tim takes 40 minutes and Steve takes 35.995 minutes, Steve is the winner.

The time difference is 40 - 35.995 = 4.005 minutes.

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting for 4.005 minutes at his house before Tim finishes the race.

{The final answer is: 4.005 minutes}</s>","Steve has to travel 3 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<3*5280=15840>>15840 feet to get home.
It will take Steve 15840 feet / (440 feet/minute) = <<15840/(440)=36>>36 minutes to get home.
Tim has to travel 2 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<2*5280=10560>>10560 feet to get home.
It will take Tim 10560 feet / (264 feet/minute) = <<10560/264=40>>40 minutes to get home.

1. She charges 25 cents to inflate each tire.

2. On the first day, 5 people came by on bicycles, which have 2 tires each. So, she inflated 5*2 = 10 tires.

3. Next, 3 people came by on tricycles, which have 3 tires each. So, she inflated an additional 3*3 = 9 tires.

4. Finally, 1 person came by on a unicycle, which has 1 tire. So, she inflated 1*1 = 1 more tire.

5. In total, she inflated 10 (from bicycles) + 9 (from tricycles) + 1 (from unicycle) = 20 tires.

6. Since she charges 25 cents for each tire, her total earnings for the day would be 20*25 = $500 cents.

7. To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. So, $500/100 = $5.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the total cost of the cookies. Carl buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack contains six cookies. So, the total number of cookies Carl bought is 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

2. Each cookie costs $0.10. So, the total cost of 60 cookies is 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00.

3. Carl pays with a $10 bill. So, the change Carl should receive is the difference between the amount he paid and the total cost of the cookies. That is, $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00.

So, {The final answer is} Carl should receive $4.00 in change.</s>","A pack of cookies costs 6 x $0.10 = $<<6*0.1=0.60>>0.60.

1. Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the pack.

2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14/2 = 7 fries.

3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3*3 = 9 fries.

4. Dave had 14 (number of fries eaten) + 7 (number of fries stolen by the seagull) = 21 fries before the pigeons ate their share.

5. The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Before the ants carried off the last fry, there were 5 fries left. So, before the ants took the fry, there were 5/1 = 5 fries and 5*2 = 10 fries before the raccoon stole some.

6. Therefore, before the raccoon stole the fries, there were 21 (before the pigeons ate) + 10 (before the raccoon took some) = 31 fries.

7. So, the pack had 31 fries when Dave bought it.

1. **Calculate the number of weeks Kimo attends school**: Since there are 16 weeks of school, and we need to find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we'll first calculate the total number of weeks he attends school. This is given as 16 weeks.

2. **Determine the number of classes Kimo has on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays**: Kimo has three 1-hour classes each on these days. So, for each of these days, he attends $3 \times 1 = 3$ hours of classes.

3. **Calculate the total hours Kimo spends on these days in a week**: Since there are 3 days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) when he has these classes, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is $3 \times 3 = 9$ hours.

4. **Determine the number of classes Kimo has on Tuesdays and Thursdays**: On these days, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day. Therefore, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is $2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$ hours.

5. **Calculate the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a week**: Adding the hours from Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to those from Tuesdays and Thursdays gives us $9 + 8 = 17$ hours per week.

6. **Find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester**: Since there are 16 weeks of school, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is $16 \times 17 = 272$ hours.

1. First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:
   - Rolls: Each roll is 4 inches long, and there are 120 rolls. So, the total length of the rolls is 4 inches/roll * 120 rolls = 480 inches.
   - Croissants: Each croissant is 6 inches long, and there are 300 croissants. So, the total length of the croissants is 6 inches/croissant * 300 croissants = 1800 inches.
   - Baguettes: Each baguette is two feet long, or 24 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches), and there are 60 baguettes. So, the total length of the baguettes is 24 inches/baguette * 60 baguettes = 1440 inches.

2. Now, let's add up all these lengths to get the total length of all the baked goods: 480 inches (rolls) + 1800 inches (croissants) + 1440 inches (baguettes) = 3720 inches.

3. Finally, to convert this total length from inches to feet, we divide by the number of inches in a foot (12 inches/foot): 3720 inches / 12 inches/foot = 310 feet.

So, the final answer is:

{The final answer is 310 feet}</s>","First find the total length of the rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = <<300*4=1200>>1200 inches
Then find the total length of the croissants: 120 rolls * 6 inches/roll = <<120*6=720>>720 inches
Then add the length of the rolls and croissants to find the total length in inches: 1200 inches + 720 inches = <<1200+720=1920>>1920 inches
Then divide the total length by 12 inches per foot to find the length in feet: 1920 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1920/12=160>>160 feet

   - Baboons need 100 bananas/month, so for 2 months, they need 100*2 = 200 bananas.

2. Now, let's add up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes for 2 months.
   - Total bananas needed = bananas for monkeys + bananas for gorillas + bananas for baboons = 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

                [/INST] First, let's find out how far Blake and Kelly have run.

Blake runs back and forth across the field 15 times. Since the field is 100 yards long, Blake runs (100 * 2) * 15 = 3000 yards.

Kelly initially runs back and forth across the field once, so she runs 100 * 2 = 200 yards. Then she starts running to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, so she runs (40 * 2) * 34 = 2720 yards in total.

Now, let's find out who the winner and loser are. Since Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards, Blake is the winner and Kelly is the loser.

The difference in the distance they ran is 3000 - 2720 = \boxed{280} yards. So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser.</s>","Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200
He runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000
Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720
She runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920
Blake won because 3000 > 2920
The winner ran 80 yards more than the loser because 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80

Next, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks. Raphael bought 2 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4. So, the total cost of the notebooks is 2 * $4 = $8.

Then, the cost of the rim of bond paper is given as $20.

Finally, to find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to add up the cost of the pens, the notebooks, and the bond paper. So, the total cost is $6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34.

Therefore, the final answer is {Raphael spent $34 on everything}.</s>","Raphael spent 4 x $1.5 = $<<4*1.5=6>>6 for the pens.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we can break it down step by step:

1. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. So, the total number of fish that Anakin caught is:
   Total fish by Anakin = Starfish + Sea horses + Clownfish

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the increase in price every two months and then apply that increase for a total of 36 months.

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20.

2. **First Increase (2 months later)**: The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. So, the increase is 20% of $20, which is $4. Therefore, the new price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

3. **Second Increase (4 months later)**: Now, the price is $24. The next increase is 20% of $24, which is $4.80. So, the price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

4. **Continuing the Pattern**: We can see that the price increases by $4 every 2 months. So, after every 2 months, we add $4 to the current price.

5. **Total Increase After 36 Months**: Since 36 months is 18 times 2 months, and the price increases by $4 every 2 months, the total increase after 36 months is 18 * $4 = $72.

6. **Final Price**: The initial price was $20. After a total increase of $72, the final price is $20 + $72 = $92.

Therefore, the final answer is:

1. **Determine the cost of an action figure**: According to the information given, one action figure costs as much as one doll. We know that the doll costs $4, so an action figure also costs $4.

2. **Determine the cost of a red car**: We are told that an action figure costs as much as one-third of a red car. Since we know the cost of an action figure is $4, we can calculate the cost of a red car. Multiplying the cost of an action figure by 3 gives us the cost of a red car:
   $$
   \text{Cost of one red car} = 3 \times \text{Cost of one action figure} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   $$

3. **Calculate the total cost of the toys**: We have 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and 1 doll in the room. Now, we calculate the total cost by adding the cost of each type of toy multiplied by their respective quantities:
   $$
   \text{Total cost} = (\text{Cost of one red car} \times 5) + (\text{Cost of one action figure} \times 3) + (\text{Cost of one doll} \times 1)
   $$
   Substituting the known values, we get:
   $$
   \text{Total cost} = (12 \times 5) + (4 \times 3) + (4 \times 1)
   $$
   Let's do the math:
   $$
   \text{Total cost} = 60 + 12 + 4 = 76 \text{ dollars}
   $$

Therefore, the total cost of all the toys in the room is $76.

For the final answer, I would represent it as:

The accountant charges $90. So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she would lose the income she would have earned doing her own taxes. But since we're only looking for the difference in income, this amount doesn't matter in this case.

Step 3: Calculate the difference in income between the two options.
The difference in missed income = $105 (from doing her own taxes) - $0 (from hiring the accountant) = $105.

Let Seth's age be S years and Brooke's age be B years.

From the question, we have two pieces of information:

1) Seth is twice as old as Brooke, which can be written as: S = 2B

2) In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be written as: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

From (1), we can say S = 2B

Substitute S = 2B into (2):

(2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

This simplifies to:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Dividing both sides by 3:

B = 8

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke (S = 2B), we can now say:

S = 2 * 8

S = 16

So, Seth is 16 years old.

{The final answer is}: Seth is 16 years old.</s>","To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.

Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. First, we need to find the cost of each part of the uniform:
   - The hat costs $25.
   - The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so it costs 3 * $25 = $75.
   - The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. So, we add the cost of the hat and the jacket, divide by 2, to get the cost of the pants. That's ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

2. Then, we add up the costs of all three parts to find the total cost of one uniform:
   - Hat: $25
   - Jacket: $75
   - Pants: $50

So, the total cost of one uniform is $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The final answer is {The total cost of one uniform is $150}.</s>","First find the cost of the jacket: $25 * 3 = $<<25*3=75>>75
Then add the cost of the jacket and hat: $25 + $75 = $<<25+75=100>>100
Then divide that amount by 2 to find the average cost, which is the cost of the pants: $100 / 2 = $<<100/2=50>>50
Then add the cost of each item of clothing to find the total cost of the uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $<<25+75+50=150>>150

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs Jake sees in the museum. We can do this by multiplying the number of each type of creature by the number of legs they have, and then adding these totals together.

First, let's calculate the number of legs for the spiders:
Spiders have 8 legs, and Jake sees 80 spiders. So, the total number of spider legs is:
80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs

Next, let's calculate the number of legs for the insects:
Insects have 6 legs, and Jake sees 90 insects. So, the total number of insect legs is:
90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs

Finally, let's calculate the number of legs for the rare mutant invertebrates:
Invertebrates have 10 legs, and Jake sees 3 of them. So, the total number of invertebrate legs is:
3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs

Now, let's add up all these totals to find the total number of legs Jake sees:
640 spider legs + 540 insect legs + 30 invertebrate legs = 1210 legs

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Granny Red's age: Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Let's denote Granny Red's age as G. So, Sally Two's age is G + 3.

2. Sally Four's age: Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four. So, Sally Four's age is G / 2.

3. Sally Thirtytwo's age: Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo. So, Sally Thirtytwo's age is G / 2. But we also know that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. So, G / 2 = 8. Solving for G, we get G = 16.

4. Sally Two's age: Now that we know Granny Red's age, we can find Sally Two's age. It's G + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19.

5. The total age of the four birds: The total age of the four birds is the sum of the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, Sally Four, and Sally Thirtytwo. So, 19 (Sally Two) + 16 (Granny Red) + 8 (Sally Four) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51.

Sally Thirtytwo, Sally four, and Sally red are 16+16 = <<32=32>>32 years old.
Sally two is three years older than Granny red, meaning Sally two is 16+3= <<16+3=19>>19 years old.

1. Student loans: $300/month
2. Credit card: $200/month
3. Mortgage: $500/month

Now, let's add up these minimum payments to find out how much Jessica pays in a month if she pays the minimum:

Total minimum payment = Student loans + Credit card + Mortgage
                       = $300 + $200 + $500
                       = $1000

Next, we calculate how much Jessica pays if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum:

Increased payment = Total minimum payment + 50% of total minimum payment
                  = $1000 + 0.5 * $1000
                  = $1000 + $500
                  = $1500

Finally, to find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12 (the number of months in a year):

Annual payment = Monthly payment * 12
               = $1500 * 12
               = $18000

So, if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, she will pay \boxed{18000} dollars in a year.</s>","First find the total minimum payment each month: $300/month + $200/month + $500/month = $<<300+200+500=1000>>1000/month

                [/INST] To find out how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time spent on peeling and cutting all the potatoes.

1. First, let's determine the time Billy spends on peeling one potato. According to the question, it takes him about a minute and a half (1.5 minutes) to peel a potato.

2. Next, we need to find out how long it takes to cut up one potato. The question states that it takes only about 5 seconds. To convert this time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 5 seconds / 60 = 1/12 minute.

3. Now, to calculate the time for cutting all potatoes, we multiply the time to cut one potato by the total number of potatoes (60). So, the total time for cutting is (1/12) minute * 60 = 5 minutes.

4. Then, we calculate the time for peeling all potatoes. We do this by multiplying the time to peel one potato by the total number of potatoes (60). So, the total time for peeling is 1.5 minutes * 60 = 90 minutes.

5. Finally, we add the time for peeling and cutting all potatoes to get the total preparation time. So, the total time is 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes.

The final answer is: \boxed{95 minutes}.</s>","There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.
Billy only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.
So it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.

2. Next, let's find out how much they made from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50, so they made 20 * $0.50 = $10 from selling lemonade.

3. Since they made $25 in profit and they made $10 from selling lemonade, they must have spent $25 - $10 = $15 on the cost of making the lemonade.

1. First, we know that there are 240 competitors in total, and 80 of them are Japanese.

2. This means that the remaining competitors are Chinese, as we are told that the rest of the competitors were Chinese.

3. So, the number of Chinese competitors is 240 - 80 = 160.

4. We are also told that 60 boys are part of the Chinese team, which leaves us with 160 - 60 = 100 competitors.

5. Since the number of boys isn't specified for the other teams, we assume that each team has an equal number of girls and boys (i.e., the number of girls is also 60).

6. Therefore, there are 100 Chinese competitors minus 60 boys, which leaves us with 40 girls on the Chinese team.

{The final answer is that there are 40 girls on the Chinese team.}</s>","If there were 80 Japanese, the number of Chinese was 240-80=<<240-80=160>>160.

1. Rent: 1/4 of his salary on rent
   Zaid's monthly salary = $6000
   Rent = 1/4 * $6000 = $1500

Next, let's calculate how much money Zaid spends on car fuel:

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to find out how many red roses Sandra ordered and then determine how many more red roses Fred needs to deliver by 5 pm to avoid losing Sandra's business.

1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as W. Then, the number of red roses is 4W.

2. Sandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This means that W = 200 / 5 = 40.

3. Now we know that Sandra ordered 4 * 40 = 160 red roses.

4. Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. This means that Fred has already delivered some red roses. Let's denote the number of red roses already delivered as R.

5. To keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver the remaining red roses by 5 pm. The number of remaining red roses is 160 - R.

6. The problem does not provide any information about the number of red roses already delivered. However, since we are asked to find out how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm, we can assume that R = 0 (i.e., Fred has not delivered any red roses yet).

7. Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 - 0 = 160 red roses by 5 pm.

The final answer is \boxed{160}.</s>","Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies / 5 = <<200/5=40>>40 white carnations.
Sandra therefore ordered 4 * 40 = <<4*40=160>>160 red roses.

                [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We know that Jan is 30 years old.

2. Two years ago, Jan would have been 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

3. At that time, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. So, half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years.

4. Therefore, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.

5. Since two years ago was 19 years ago, that means Mark is currently 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

6. The problem also states that Jean is two years older than Mark. So, if Mark is 21 years old, Jean would be 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

\boxed{23}</s>","2 years ago Jan was 30-2=<<30-2=28>>28 years old

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the relay race and then find the difference between the two times.

Step 1: Calculate the total time taken by the well-rounded team (Team A).
Since each member of Team A runs their 400-meter leg in precisely 55 seconds, and there are four members in the team, the total time taken by Team A is:
Total time for Team A = Time taken by each member * Number of members
= 55 seconds * 4
= 220 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the total time taken by the less well-rounded team (Team B).
The first runner of Team B will run their 400-meter leg in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. So, the times taken by the runners of Team B are 60, 57, 54, and 51 seconds. Therefore, the total time taken by Team B is:
Total time for Team B = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51
= 222 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the difference in time between the two teams.
Difference in time = Time taken by Team B - Time taken by Team A
= 222 seconds - 220 seconds
= 2 seconds

Therefore, the faster team (Team A) will win the race by 2 seconds.

Final answer: \boxed{2}</s>","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. Then, we'll compare these probabilities to find out which is more likely.

1. Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:
A six-sided die has numbers from 1 to

6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and

6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes.
Probability (P) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
P(greater than 3) = 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%

2. Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers.
Probability of rolling an even number once: P(even) = 3/6 = 0.5
Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: P(even and even) = P(even) * P(even) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%

3. Now, compare the two probabilities:
Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 50%
Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 25%

So, rolling a number greater than 3 is more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. The difference between the two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

So, {The final answer is: Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.}</s>","There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 160 pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents (rats, hamsters, and rabbits).
2. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
3. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
4. In the pen of rabbits, 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

Now, let's calculate the number of straw pieces used by rats and hamsters:

Straw for rats = Number of rats / Number of cages * Pieces per rat = n * 6 / 3 = 2n
Straw for hamsters = Number of hamsters * Pieces per hamster = 10 * 5 = 50

We know that the total amount of straw used for rats and hamsters is 160 pieces, so:

2n + 50 = 160

Now let's solve for n:

2n = 110
n = 55

Since n represents the number of rats in each cage and there are 3 cages, the number of rats in each cage is 55.

{The final answer is: 55}</s>","In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

                [/INST] The monthly interest is 2%. This means that, after each month, the debt increases by 2% of its size.

After 1 month, the debt would be $100 + $2 (which is 2% of $100).

After 2 months, you would again add 2% of the debt from the first month. So, you would add 2% of ($100 + $2) to the debt.

After 3 months, you would again add 2% of the debt from the second month. So, you would add 2% of ($100 + $2 + $0.04) (which is the debt after 2 months) to the debt.

So, the final amount Mandy owes is:

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to determine the trader's total revenue from selling the wheat bags. He sells each bag for $30 and made a total profit of $400. Therefore, the total revenue is $400 (profit) + $X (cost of wheat) + $X (transportation cost) = $Y (total revenue).

2. The cost of wheat for each bag is $20, and the cost of transporting each bag is $2. So the total cost for each bag is $20 (cost of wheat) + $2 (transportation cost) = $22.

3. We know that the total profit is $400, and the total revenue is $Y. So, $Y (total revenue) - $400 (profit) = $X (total cost of wheat) + $X (transportation cost) = $2X (total cost).

4. Therefore, $Y - $400 = $2X.

5. We also know that the trader made a total profit of $400 by selling all the bags. So, $30 (selling price per bag) - $22 (total cost per bag) = $8 (profit per bag).

6. Let's denote the number of bags sold as N. So, $8 (profit per bag) * N (number of bags) = $400 (total profit).

1. First, we need to find out how much the friends spent on food. They spent $20.25 on tickets and $33 on rides, which totals $53.25.
2. They spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets, so they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.
3. Now, let's find out how much the friends spent in total. They spent $53.25 on tickets and rides and $15.75 on food, which totals $68.00.
4. Finally, they agreed to split all the costs evenly. There are three friends, so each friend paid $68.00 / 3 = $22.67.

First, let's calculate the number of peaches John collects in one hour. Since he collects 2 peaches per minute, and there are 60 minutes in an hour:

Number of peaches in 1 hour = Peaches collected per minute * Minutes per hour
                                      = 2 * 60

                [/INST] The problem is asking for the daily insect consumption of a flock of ten ducks. Each duck consumes 3.5 pounds of insects per week, so the total weekly consumption for the flock is calculated by multiplying the weekly consumption per duck by the number of ducks.

Total weekly consumption for the flock = Weekly consumption per duck * Number of ducks
= 3.5 pounds * 10 ducks
= 35 pounds

Then, to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day, we need to divide the total weekly consumption by the number of days in a week.

Weekly consumption = Daily consumption * Number of days
Daily consumption = Weekly consumption / Number of days
= 35 pounds / 7 days
= 5 pounds per day

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Annual Addition and Removal of Trees**: 
   - Tom plants 10 trees each year.
   - Every year, he also chops down 2 trees.
   - Therefore, the net increase in trees per year is $10 - 2 = 8$ trees.

3. **Total Trees After 10 Years**: 
   - In 10 years, the total increase in trees is $8 \times 10 = 80$ trees.
   - So, after 10 years, before accounting for the 30% death rate, the total number of trees is $50 + 80 = 130$ trees.

4. **Accounting for the 30% Death Rate**: 
   - 30% of the trees die after 10 years.
   - The number of trees that die is $30\% \times 130 = 0.30 \times 130 = 39$ trees.

5. **Final Number of Trees**:

1. Start with 18 pink plastic flamingos on Friday morning.
2. On Saturday morning, they took back one third of the flamingos. So, they took back 18/3 = 6 flamingos. This leaves 12 flamingos on Sue's front yard.
3. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, on Saturday evening, there are 12 pink and 6 white flamingos on Sue's front yard.
4. On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink flamingos. So, there are now 12 (from Saturday) + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos on Sue's front yard.
5. Now, to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos. So, 30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24.

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos out than white plastic flamingos. {The final answer is 24}</s>","On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.
This left 18 pink - 6 = <<18-6=12>>12 pink flamingos.
On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, for a total of 12 + 18 = <<12+18=30>>30 pink flamingos on the front lawn.
Altogether, there were 30 pink and 6 white flamingos on the lawn, so there were 30 pink - 6 white =<<30-6=24>>24 more pink flamingos.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out the total cost of the crayons. Since Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors and each crayon costs $2, the total cost will be:

Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon
   Total cost = 5 * $2
   Total cost = $10

2. Next, we need to find out how much change Violetta will get. She has prepared $20 for the purchase. So, the change will be the difference between the amount she has prepared and the total cost of the crayons:

Change = Amount prepared - Total cost
   Change = $20 - $10
   Change = $10

So, the final answer is that Violetta will get $10 in change.

{The final answer is: $10}</s>","Violetta is going to pay 5 * 2 = $<<5*2=10>>10 for the crayons she wants.

                [/INST] First, we need to determine the cost of one pen. We are told that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. So, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser together to find the cost of one pen.

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30

So, the cost of one pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
= $1.20 + $0.30
= $1.50

Next, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. To do this, we multiply the cost of one pen by the number of pens.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * Number of pens
= $1.50 * 8
= $12.00

To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be used and subtract that from the total amount available.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of carrots that will be used.
To do this, we multiply the number of restaurants by the amount of carrots each restaurant will receive.

TotalCarrotsUsed = Restaurants * CarrotsPerRestaurant
TotalCarrotsUsed = 40 * 2
TotalCarrotsUsed = 80 pounds

Step 2: Subtract the total amount of carrots used from the total amount available to find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used.

CarrotsNotUsed = TotalCarrotsAvailable - TotalCarrotsUsed
CarrotsNotUsed = 200 - 80
CarrotsNotUsed = 120 pounds

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number. So, she collected 20 * 3 = 60 more cards. Now, she has 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) = 80 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. So, she collected 60 (first month) - 20 = 40 more cards. Now, she has 80 (after first month) + 40 (second month) = 120 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. So, she collected 2 * (60 (first month) + 40 (second month)) = 2 * 100 = 200 more cards. Now, she has 120 (after second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

1. Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers. Let's denote the number of sentences he edits for each publisher as S.

2. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for each publisher, Mark earns 5S cents.

3. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays per sentence. So, Publisher B pays Mark 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.

4. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, so the total number of sentences he edits for both publishers is 2S = 1000. Therefore, S = 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

5. Now, we can calculate how much Mark makes in a week for each publisher. For Publisher A, he makes 5 * 500 = 2500 cents, and for Publisher B, he makes 10 * 500 = 5000 cents.

6. Finally, we add the amounts he makes from both publishers to find out how much Mark makes in a week. So, Mark makes 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.

2. Next, we need to calculate the effect of the 5% raise. A 5% raise on $104,000 would be $104,000 * 0.05 = $5200. So, after the raise, his annual salary would be $104,000 + $5200 = $109,200.

3. Then, we need to consider the $5000 monetary reward. So, his total earnings for the year would be $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200.

                [/INST] Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find the total points Brinley has from the first five tests. We do this by adding all her scores together: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448.

2. Next, we want to find the average score Brinley has from these tests. To do this, we divide the total points by the number of tests: 448 / 5 = 89.6.

3. Mr. Bert allows students to remove the lowest score when calculating the average. So, we need to subtract Brinley's lowest score from her current average: 89.6 - 71 = 18.6.

4. Now, we want to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to improve her average to 93. Since she needs to improve by 93 - 18.6 = 74.4, this is the score she needs to get on the sixth test.

5. However, since we can't have a fraction in this context, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. So, Brinley needs to score 75 on the sixth test.

Therefore, \boxed{75} is the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93.</s>","First, identify the lowest score, which is 71, and remove it.
Since Brinley wants a score of 93, we know her total score needs to be 93 (average) * 5 (tests) = <<93*5=465>>465 points
So far, Brinley has earned 89 + 92 +100 + 86 = <<89+92+100+86=367>>367 points
The final test must be 465 - 367 = <<465-367=98>>98 points.

1. Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week for 4 weeks. That means he rode it (5 times/week * 4 weeks) = 20 times in total.

2. At each ride, he made 25 kilometers. So, in total, he rode 25 km/ride * 20 rides = 500 kilometers in the first 4 weeks.

3. Then, he decided to ride the bike only 2 times a week for 3 weeks. That means he rode his bike 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 6 times in the next 3 weeks.

4. At each of these rides, he made 60 kilometers. So, in total, he rode 60 km/ride * 6 rides = 360 kilometers in the next 3 weeks.

5. To find out how many kilometers Micheal did in total, we add the distances from both periods: 500 km (first 4 weeks) + 360 km (next 3 weeks) = 860 kilometers.

After that, he made 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 kilometers a week.
And Micheal did that for three weeks, so he rode 120 * 3 = <<120*3=360>>360 kilometers during that time.

1. We first need to find out the total weight of the chocolate bars. Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and there are 25 chocolate bars. So, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 (number of chocolate bars) * 40g (weight of each chocolate bar).

2. This gives us a total weight for the chocolate bars of 1000 grams.

3. Next, we need to find out the weigh of each candied apple. We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, each candied apple weighs half of that, or 20g.

4. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 (number of candied apples) * 20g (weight of each candied apple). This gives us a total weight for the candied apples of 1600 grams.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since one dozen is equal to 12, half a dozen is equal to

6. If each plate costs $600, then the total cost for half a dozen plates is 6 * $600 = $3600.

2. We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of twenty dozen cups:

Cost of twenty dozen cups = Cost of half a dozen plates - $1200

3. Substitute the value found in step 1 into the equation:

Cost of twenty dozen cups = $3600 - $1200 = $2400

4. Since twenty dozen cups are sold, this means we are dealing with the cost of 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

5. Now, to find the cost of each cup, we can divide the total cost by the number of cups:

Cost per cup = Cost of twenty dozen cups / Total number of cups

6. Substitute the values found in steps 3 and 4 into the equation:

Cost per cup = $2400 / 240

7. The final answer is:

{Cost per cup = $10}</s>","Since a dozen has 12 items, half a dozen plates are 12/2 = <<6=6>>6
Half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each cost 6*$6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000
Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800
Since a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.

                [/INST] To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes:**
   - The jacket costs $30.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so $20 \times 2 = $40.
   - Therefore, the total cost is $30 (jacket) + $40 (shoes) = $70.

2. **Calculate how much Sara earns each time she babysits:**
   - She earns $5 each time she babysits.

3. **Determine the additional amount Sara needs:**
   - She already has $10 saved.
   - The total cost is $70, and she has $10, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

4. **Calculate how much she earns from babysitting:**
   - She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so $5 \times 4 = $20.

5. **Calculate the remaining amount she needs after babysitting:**
   - After earning $20 from babysitting, she still needs $60 - $20 = $40.

6. **Determine how many times she must mow the lawn:**
   - Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn.
   - She needs $40 more, so she must mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times.

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn $\boxed{10}$ times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.</s>","Both pairs of shoes will cost a total of 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W.

2. We know that the number of white chickens is 2 more than the number of red chickens, so we can express the number of white chickens as W = R + 2.

3. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3R.

4. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5W.

5. We also know that Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, so we can set up the equation 3R + 5W = 42.

6. Now, we substitute W from step 2 into this equation, giving us 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42.

7. Simplifying this equation gives us 3R + 5R + 10 = 42, or 8R + 10 = 42.

8. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us 8R = 32.

9. Finally, dividing both sides by 8 gives us R = 4.

So, the final answer is that Jerry has 4 red chickens.</s>","First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32

Gary likes to walk around the edge of a rectangular park. The park measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. We need to find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park.

Step 2: Calculate the perimeter of the park
To find out the distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2*(length + width). In this case, the length is 1.5 miles and the width is 6 miles. So, P = 2*(1.5 + 6) = 2*7.5 = 15 miles.

Step 3: Calculate the time Gary spends walking
Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The distance he walks is 15 miles. So, the time he spends walking is time = distance/speed = 15 miles/3 miles/hour = 5 hours.

Final answer: Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park. {The final answer is 5 hours}</s>","First find the length of the two long sides of the park: 6 miles * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 miles

3. The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

Now the big , pool : has ; four ! times as much water as , the small . pool. . How much water ; does the small pool . have now?
                [/INST] Let's denote the volume of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago as 2x and the volume of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, this holds true.

Now, both pools are leaking water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. So, in 4 minutes, the big pool would have lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the small pool would have lost 16 gallons of water.

The volume of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16.

The volume of water in the small pool now is x - 16.

We are given that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can write the equation:

2x - 16 = 4 * (x - 16)

Solving this equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

28 = 2x

x = 14

So, the small pool had 14 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Now, it has lost 16 gallons of water due to the leak, so it has 14 - 16 = -2 gallons of water left.

However, it's not possible for a pool to have a negative volume of water. This indicates that there's a mistake in our calculations or our understanding of the problem.

Let's reconsider what we know: Jerry has two pools, both losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes before, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

We can't solve this problem with the information given, as the scenario described doesn't make sense. If 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, it could not now have four times as much water, given that both pools are losing water.

Therefore, {The final answer is: This problem is not solvable with the information given.}</s>","First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons
Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the items Lori wants to buy and then calculate how many hours she needs to work to earn that amount.

1. First, let's find the total cost of the items. The pair of shoes costs $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. So, the total cost is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

2. Next, we need to figure out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. We know that Lori earns $8.00 per hour. So, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage: $352.00 / $8.00 = 44 hours.

\boxed{44 hours} is the final answer.</s>","She wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320.00 and a belt for $32.00 for a total of 320+32 = $<<320+32=352.00>>352.00

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total amount that Janeth has to return.
Janeth has to return the borrowed amount plus an additional 10% of the amount. So, the total amount to be returned is calculated as follows:
Total amount = Borrowed amount + (10% of borrowed amount)
Total amount = $2000 + (0.10 * $2000)
Total amount = $2000 + $200
Total amount = $2200

Step 2: Calculate the total amount that Janeth will pay in 12 months.
Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. So, the total amount she will pay is calculated as follows:
Total payment = Monthly payment * Number of months
Total payment = $165 * 12
Total payment = $1980

Step 3: Calculate Janeth's remaining balance.
To find out Janeth's remaining balance, subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she has to return.
Remaining balance = Total amount to be returned - Total payment
Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980
Remaining balance = $220

{The final answer is: Janeth will have a remaining balance of $220.}</s>","Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.
So she is going to pay off a total of $2000 + $200 = $<<2000+200=2200>>2200.
Janeth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.
Hence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.

1. We start with 4 roses in the vase.
2. We know there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, we add 7 to the number of roses to get the number of dahlias. That is, 4 roses + 7 = 11 dahlias.
3. Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias. That is, 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers in total.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Determine Adrian's age**: Given that Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, and Harriet is 21 years old, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
   Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

2. **Determine Zack's age**: Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by doubling Harriet's age:
   Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.

3. **Calculate the future ages of Harriet, Adrian, and Zack**: The problem asks for the average age in three years. So, we need to add three to the current ages of each person:
   - Future age of Harriet = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
   - Future age of Adrian = 63 + 3 = 66 years.
   - Future age of Zack = 42 + 3 = 45 years.

4. **Calculate the average age**: To find the average age in three years, we add up the future ages and then divide by the number of people:
   Average age = (Future Harriet's age + Future Adrian's age + Future Zack's age) / 3
   = (24 + 66 + 45) / 3
   = 135 / 3
   = 45 years.

{The final answer is} 45 years.</s>","In three years, Harriet will be 21+3 = <<21+3=24>>24 years old.
Since Adrian's age is three times that of Harriet, Adrian is 3*21 = <<3*21=63>>63 years old.
In three years, he will be 63+3 =<<63+3=66>>66 years old.
If Harriet is half times the age of Zack, Zack is 21*2 = <<21*2=42>>42 years old.
In three years, he will be 42+3 = <<42+3=45>>45 years old.
The combined age of the three in 3 years will be 45+66+24 = <<45+66+24=135>>135 years.

                [/INST] Let's denote the total number of points that Naomi scored as N. According to the information given:

N = 68

Yuri scored 10 more points than half as many points as Naomi, so we can represent Yuri's points as:

Yuri's points = (1/2)N + 10

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so her points can be represented as:

Brianna's points = N + 17

We can plug in Naomi's points (N = 68) to find Brianna's points:

Brianna's points = 68 + 17 = 85

Now, we can find Yuri's points:

Yuri's points = (1/2)N + 10 = (1/2)(68) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44

We know the total points scored by all four students is 251. So, we can represent Jojo's points as:

Jojo's points = Total points - (Naomi's points + Yuri's points + Brianna's points)

Jojo's points = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85)

Jojo's points = 251 - 197 = 54

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kalinda's mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. This means she can place 2 pieces per minute (since Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute).

2. Together, their combined rate of placing pieces per minute is the sum of their individual rates, which is 4 (Kalinda's rate) + 2 (her mom's rate) = 6 pieces per minute.

3. To find out how long it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate of placing pieces per minute: 360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.

4. Since the question asks for the time in hours, we convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 minutes is equivalent to 1 hour.

The final answer is: \boxed{1}.</s>","Her mom places 2 pieces per minute because 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2
On average they get in 6 pieces per minute because 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6

                [/INST] First, let's find out how many watermelons were ready after two months. Since 30% of the total were ready, we calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = (30/100) * 120 = 36 watermelons

So, after two months, 36 watermelons were ready. This means that 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons were still not ready.

Then, when Ashlyn came back after two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. So, 3/4 of 84 is:

3/4 * 84 = 63 watermelons

These were the watermelons ready in the next step. So, the watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks would be the ones left from the previous step, which is 84 - 63.

Therefore, the number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 84 - 63 = {11 melons}.</s>","When Ashlyn found out that 30% of the melons were ready, she took home 30/100 *120 = <<30/100*120=36>>36 watermelons.

When she returned two weeks later, she found that 3/4*84 = <<3/4*84=63>>63 were ready for harvest,
The number of watermelons that were not ready is 84-63 =<<84-63=21>>21

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars. So, the total cost of the cars is:
Total cost of cars = Cost of one car * Number of cars
Total cost of cars = $20,000 * 12
Total cost of cars = $240,000

Next, we need to calculate the total tax Mark pays. He pays a 10% tax on the total cost of the cars. So, the total tax is:
Total tax = Total cost of cars * Tax rate
Total tax = $240,000 * 0.1
Total tax = $24,000

Now, we add the registration fee. The registration fee is $1,000 for each car, and Mark has 12 cars. So, the total registration fee is:
Total registration fee = Registration fee per car * Number of cars
Total registration fee = $1,000 * 12
Total registration fee = $12,000

Finally, we add the total cost of the cars, the total tax, and the total registration fee to find the total amount Mark pays for everything:
Total amount = Total cost of cars + Total tax + Total registration fee
Total amount = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000
Total amount = $276,000

So, the final answer is {The final answer is \boxed{276000}}.</s>","The cars cost 20000*12=$<<20000*12=240000>>240,000

1. The problem states that Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. If there were 50 ants, then to find the number of bugs, we divide the number of ants by 2.

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25

2. Now, to find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs together.

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs = 50 + 25

1. We start with 36 penguins sunbathing.

2. One-third of them jump into the ocean. To find out how many this is, we calculate 36/3 = 12. So, 12 penguins enter the ocean.

3. This leaves us with 36 - 12 = 24 penguins still sunbathing.

4. Another one-third of the original 36 penguins go inside the cave. Again, calculating one-third of 36 gives us 36/3 = 12. So, 12 more penguins enter the cave.

5. This leaves us with 24 - 12 = 12 penguins still sunbathing.

3. If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, it can produce 3/7 tomatoes per day (since there are 7 days in a week).
4. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and a vine can produce 3/7 tomatoes per day, the number of vines Steve needs depends on how many days a week he eats tomatoes. If we assume he eats tomatoes every day, then:

Number of vines = (Steve's daily tomato intake) / (Daily production of a vine) = 6 / (3/7) = 42/3 = 14

So, Steve needs 14 vines to meet his daily tomato intake.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining students after exit A
After some students went out through exit A, there are (1 - 30%) * 1000 = 0.7 * 1000 = 700 students left.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that John has 54 candies.

2. We are also told that John has twice as many candies as Robert. So, we can find the number of candies Robert has by dividing the number of candies John has by 2.

   Number of candies Robert has = Number of candies John has / 2
                                 = 54 / 2
                                 = 27 candies

3. The problem also states that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can find the number of candies James has by adding 6 to the number of candies Robert has.

   Number of candies James has = Number of candies Robert has + 6
                                = 27 + 6
                                = 33 candies

4. Finally, we are asked to find out how many more candies John has than James. So, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has.

   More candies John has than James = Number of candies John has - Number of candies James has

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike is a pen pal with 5 people.
2. He stops being penpals with 2 of them, so he is now pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.
3. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, that are 5 pages long each. So, 3 * 2 = 6 letters are sent to Mike a week.
4. Each letter is 5 pages long, so in total, he receives 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.
5. Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages per week.
6. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. So, to write 30 pages, it would take him 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To find out how many hours he spends writing a week:

7. We convert minutes to hours by dividing by the number of minutes in an hour (60). So, 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

1. Jason has a phone plan with 1000 minutes per month.
2. For 30 days, he has a 15-minute daily call with his boss. The total minutes for these calls are 30 days * 15 minutes/day = 450 minutes.
3. He also has 300 extra minutes of calls to other people throughout the month.
4. Adding these up, Jason has used up 450 minutes (boss calls) + 300 minutes (extra calls) = 750 minutes.
5. His phone plan includes 1000 minutes per month. Therefore, Jason has 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes left in this month.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Griffin had 24 French fries.
2. Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so he took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.
4. Colby took 3 fewer fries than Kyle, so he took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
5. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries.

Now, let's go back to the point where Griffin has 27 fries. To get to this point, we need to add back the fries that Coleb took:

6. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin would have 27 + 2 = 29 fries.

Now, we have the number of fries Griffin would have after Billy took his fries and after Colby took his fries. Since Billy took the same number of fries as Ginger gave to Griffin, we can find out how many fries Ginger gave to Griffin by subtracting the number of fries Griffin had before Billy took his from the number he ended up with after receiving fries from Ginger and before Billy took his:

7. Ginger gave Griffin the difference between the number of fries he had after Colby took his and the number of fries he had after Kyle took his: 29 - 19 = 10 fries.

So, the final answer is \boxed{10}.</s>","Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, removing 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 fries.
Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, removing 5-3=<<5-3=2>>2 fries.

2. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

3. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we have the equation: 28 = 2 * (2F)

                [/INST] To calculate the total amount Jean paid to the makeup artist, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist will work. She works for 6 hours each day, and she needs it done 4 times a week. So, for one week, she works 6 * 4 = 24 hours.
2. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total number of hours she works is 24 * 5 = 120 hours.
3. The makeup artist charges $250 an hour. So, before the discount, the total cost for 120 hours of work would be 120 * $250 = $30000.
4. After the movie is finished, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount for the amount of work done. So, the discount amount would be 10% of $30000, which is 0.10 * $30000 = $3000.
5. Subtracting the discount from the original amount, Jean paid $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

Therefore, \boxed{27000} is the final answer.</s>","Jean pays 250*6=$<<250*6=1500>>1500 a day

    - Decorations: $15
    - Invitations: $4
    - Goodie bags: $22
    - Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

2. Next, we need to find out how much each person will pay. Isabelle is splitting the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, so:
    - Total cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
    - Total cost per person = $96 / 3 = $32

2. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister did on Monday. Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

3. In total, Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday and 26 cookies on Tuesday, which adds up to 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

4. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, which adds up to 5 + 13 = 18 cookies in total.

5. Each cookie has 200 calories, so Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.

1. We know that each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes in total.
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
4. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls.

Now, let's calculate the total number of girls in the first two classes:

15 girls (first class) + 12 girls (second class) = 27 girls

Since there are 3 classes with 20 students each, there are a total of 60 students in the school.

As the school is 50% boys, there are 30 boys in the school (60 students * 50%).

Now we know the number of boys and girls in the school, but we still need to figure out the number of boys in the third class. Since we know the number of girls in the first two classes, we can calculate it as follows:

Total number of students in the third class = 20 students
Total number of girls in the third class = Total girls - (Girls in class 1 + Girls in class 2)
Total number of girls in the third class = 30 girls - 27 girls
Total number of girls in the third class = 3 girls

Now, to find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the third class from the total students in the third class:

Boys in the third class = Total students in the third class - Girls in the third class
Boys in the third class = 20 students - 3 girls
Boys in the third class = 17 boys

{The final answer is 17 boys} in the third class.</s>","The school has 60 students because 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60

1. On the previous night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. So, the total number of animals he killed on the previous night is 10 + 15 = 25 animals.
2. Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. This means that the number of wolves he killed today is 3 times the number of cougars he killed today.
3. Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as C. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3C.
4. Rick also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so C = 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.
5. Therefore, the number of wolves Rick killed today is 3C = 3 \* 12 = 36 wolves.
6. So, the total number of animals Rick killed today is 36 + 12 = 48 animals.

1. Initially, each of the ten stalls has 20 cows. So, the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

2. Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the new total number of cows is 200 + 40 = 240 cows.

3. Mr. Sylas divides these 240 cows equally among the 10 stalls. So, each stall now has 240 / 10 = 24 cows.

4. We want to find out how many cows are in 8 of these stalls. So, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by the number of stalls, which is 24 * 8 = 192 cows.

The final answer is, therefore, {192 cows}.</s>","When Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the cows he bought into the stalls, each stall gets 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 new cows.
Each of the stalls gets four cows, meaning a total of 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 cows are placed into eight of the stalls.
Since each stall had 20 cows before Mr. Sylas added four into each of the stalls, the total number of cows in eight of the stalls was 8*20= <<8*20=160>>160 cows.
There are 160+32 = <<160+32=192>>192 cows in eight stalls after Mr. Sylas adds four into each of the stalls.

1. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01, and Brady has 100 of them. So, the total value of the pennies is:
   \[
   100 \times 0.01 = \$1
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05, and Brady has 40 of them. So, the total value of the nickels is:
   \[

3. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10, and Brady has 20 of them. So, the total value of the dimes is:
   \[
   20 \times 0.10 = \$2
   \]

4. **Dollar Bills**: Each dollar bill is worth $1, and Brady has 40 of them. So, the total value of the dollar bills is:
   \[
   40 \times 1 = \$40
   \]

Adding all these values together gives us the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank:
\[
\$1 + \$2 + \$2 + \$40 = \$45
\]

Therefore, the final answer, encapsulated as requested, is:
\[
\boxed{\$45}
\]</s>","Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.
Since nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.
Since a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.
So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.

                [/INST] Let's break this down:

1. First, let's calculate the weight of the untouched wood in one 10-foot section. We know that each section weighs 400 pounds.
2. However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to find out how much of the section is still intact. To do this, we can multiply the weight of the section by 70% (since 100% - 30% = 70%). Doing this, we get: 400 * 0.7 = 280 pounds. So, each 10-foot section of the tree now weighs 280 pounds.
3. Next, let's find out how many 10-foot sections there are in a 200-foot tree. We do this by dividing the total height of the tree by the length of one section. So, 200 / 10 = 20 sections.
4. Finally, to find out the total weight of the tree, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section. So, 20 * 280 = 5600 pounds.

1. Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's add up all the fruits:

- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, which makes 52 + 24 = 76 fruits in total.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, which makes 44 + 48 = 92 fruits in total.

So, there are a total of Andrea's 52 apples + Andrea's 24 bananas + Jamal's 44 apples + Jamal's 48 bananas = 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of flour required to bake a certain number of cookies and then apply that ratio to the number of cookies Carla plans to bake today and tomorrow.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Carla will bake in total.
Total cookies = Cookies today + Cookies tomorrow
Total cookies = 36 + 30
Total cookies = 66

Step 2: Determine the ratio of flour to cookies.
From the question, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. A dozen is 12, so we can write this as a ratio:
Flour : Cookies = 2 : 12
Simplify the ratio by dividing both sides by 2.
Flour : Cookies = 1 : 6

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of flour needed for all the cookies.
Total flour = Total cookies * Flour per cookie
Since the ratio is 1:6, each cookie requires 1 cup of flour.
Total flour = 66 * 1
Total flour = 66

Step 4: Divide the total amount of flour by 2 to find out how much Carla needs for today and tomorrow separately.
Since Carla will be making an equal number of cookies each day, she will also use an equal amount of flour each day.
Flour for today or tomorrow = Total flour / 2
Flour for today or tomorrow = 66 / 2
Flour for today or tomorrow = 33

So, Carla will need 33 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and 33 cups of flour to bake the cookies tomorrow.

{The final answer is} 33 cups of flour for today and 33 cups of flour for tomorrow.</s>","Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.

1. First, we need to calculate the brokerage fee. This is 5% of the selling price of the house, which is $350,000. So, the brokerage fee is calculated as follows:

   [$350,000 * 5% = $17,500]

2. Next, we calculate the transfer fee. This is 12% of the selling price. So, the transfer fee is:

3. Now, we add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price of the house:

   [$350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $410,500]

4. Finally, we subtract Mrs. Cruz's budget from the total price of the house to find out how much more she would be paying:

   [$410,500 - $400,000 = $10,500]

So, the total price of the house is $10,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget. {The final answer is $10,500}.</s>","The brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17500.

                    . Mr. ; Tan : sold his house for $400 000. He paid ? the transfer fees , that amount to 3% of the selling price and also paid a ? brokerage fee that is 5% of ! the selling ! price. ! If he also paid $250 : 000 ; for . the remaining loan amount of the ? house, how , much is ! Mr. Tan's net . proceeds from selling : the house?
                [/INST] To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract all the fees he paid from the selling price of the house.

1. Calculate the transfer fee: $400,000 * 3% = $400,000 * 0.03 = $12,000
2. Calculate the brokerage fee: $400,000 * 5% = $400,000 * 0.05 = $20,000
3. Add the remaining loan amount he paid back: $250,000
4. Add up all the fees he paid: $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000
5. Subtract the total fees from the selling price to find the net proceeds: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $\boxed{118000}$.</s>","Mr. Tan paid $400 000 x 3/100 = $12 000 for the transfer fees.
He paid $400 000 x 5/100 = $20 000 for the brokerage fee.
So, Mr. Tan paid a total of $12 000 + $20 000 + $250 000 = $282 000 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.
Hence, Mr. Tan's net proceeds is $400 000 - $282 000 = $118 000.

                [/INST] Step 1: Determine the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
It takes 40% longer to heat the oil to 400 degrees than it does to heat it to 300 degrees. So, we need to find 40% of the time it takes to heat it to 300 degrees and add that to the original time.

Step 2: Calculate 40% of 20 minutes.
40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes.

Step 3: Add the extra time to the original time to find the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes.

Step 4: Determine the time it takes to cook the chicken once the oil is heated to 400 degrees.
It takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it does to warm the oil. So, we subtract 5 minutes from the time it takes to warm the oil.

Step 5: Subtract 5 minutes from the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes.

Step 6: Add the time it takes to heat the oil to the time it takes to cook the chicken to find the total time from starting to have cooked chicken.
The final answer is 28 minutes + 23 minutes = \boxed{51 minutes}.</s>","It takes 20*.4=8 more minutes to go from 300 to 400 degrees than from room temperature to 300
So it takes 20+8=<<20+8=28>>28 minutes to warm up
So the total warming time was 28+20=<<28+20=48>>48 minutes
So it took 48-5=<<48-5=43>>43 minutes to cook the chicken
So it took 48+43=<<48+43=91>>91 minutes to make the chicken.

1. The juggler can juggle a total of 16 balls.

2. Half of these are golf balls, so the number of golf balls is calculated by dividing the total number of balls by 2:
   \[
   \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ golf balls}
   \]

3. Half of these golf balls are blue, so to find the number of blue golf balls, we again divide the number of golf balls by 2:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, which is 900/10 = 90 stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.
4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. This includes the body, both sleeves, the collar, and the rosette. So, the number of stitches for the two sleeves combined is 1800 - (900 for the body + 90 for the collar + 180 for the rosette) = 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.
5. Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes half of the remaining 630 stitches, which is 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches. The final answer is {315}.</s>","The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.
The rosette takes 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 stitches.
The body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = <<900+90+180=1170>>1170 stitches.
Thus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.

The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. The solo song has 54 lines, so the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.

Step 2: Determine the number of lines in the first scene that are Sean's.
The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. The solo song has 54 lines, so the first scene has 2 * 54 = 108 lines in total. Only a third of them are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

                [/INST] Here's how to think through this problem:

Let's denote Mico's age by M, and Marco's age by X. According to the text, M + X = 20. This is because the total age of Miko and Marco is 20.

Solving for one of the variables, let's say M, gives us M = 20 - X.

In 10 years, both Miko and Marco will be older by 10 years. So their ages in 10 years will be M + 10 and X + 10, respectively.

Adding these two expressions together gives us (20 - X) + 10 + X + 10 = 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be {40}.</s>","There will be an additional 10 (for Mico) + 10 9for Marco) = <<10+10=20>>20 to Mico and Marco's current sum of ages in 10 years.
Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years is 20 + 20 = <<20+20=40>>40.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Ruby is currently 6 times older than Sam. Let's denote Sam's current age as S and Ruby's current age as R. So, we have the equation: R = 6S

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

3. Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

4. Solving this equation for S gives: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 => 3S = 18 => S = 6

5. So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Final Answer: \boxed{6}</s>","Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.
In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
We simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.
Now we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.

Popsicles cost $0.25 each, and Peter bought 20 popsicles. So, the total cost of popsicles = Number of popsicles * Price per popsicle = 20 * $0.25.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of ice cream bars.
Ice cream bars cost $0.50 each, and Peter bought 4 ice cream bars. So, the total cost of ice cream bars = Number of ice cream bars * Price per ice cream bar = 4 * $0.50.

1. A cobra has 70 spots.
2. A cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. So, a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra. Since a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.
3. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park.
4. The total number of spots from cobras is 40 (number of cobras) * 70 (spots per cobra) = 2800 spots.
5. The total number of spots from mambas is 60 (number of mambas) * 35 (spots per mamba) = 2100 spots.
6. The total number of spots from all snakes is 2800 (from cobras) + 2100 (from mambas) = 4900 spots.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. There are 12 team members, 3 coaches, and 2 guests for each team member. So, the total number of people is:

Total people = Team members + Coaches + Team members' guests
= 12 + 3 + (12 * 2)
= 12 + 3 + 24

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy. Since each pizza serves 3 people, the number of pizzas needed is:

Number of pizzas = Total people / People per pizza
= 39 / 3
= 13 (rounding up since Maddy can't buy a fraction of a pizza)

Finally, let's calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is:

1. Calculate the total length of topaz gemstones per necklace:
   Each necklace has 8 topaz gemstones, and each gemstone is one inch long. Therefore, the total length of topaz gemstones per necklace is:
   \[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ inches} \]

2. Calculate the remaining length for silver beads:
   Each necklace is made to a total length of 25 inches. After subtracting the length of topaz gemstones, the remaining length for silver beads is:
   \[ 25 - 8 = 17 \text{ inches} \]

3. Calculate the number of sterling silver beads per necklace:
   Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long. To find out how many beads Katerina uses per necklace, we divide the remaining length by the length of one silver bead:
   \[ \frac{17}{\frac{1}{4}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \]

Therefore, Katerina uses $\boxed{68}$ sterling silver beads per necklace.</s>","8 topaz gemstones, at 1 inch per gemstone, contribute a total of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 inches to each necklace.
Since each necklace is 25 inches in length, then there are 25-8=<<25-8=17>>17 inches of space between gemstones.

Braylen's second week stories = 40 * 2 = 80 stories,
Margot's second week stories = 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from the first week and the second week for each person:

Alani's total stories = 20 (first week) + 40 (second week) = 60 stories,
Braylen's total stories = 40 (first week) + 80 (second week) = 120 stories,

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total value of Kelly's coins in cents:**
   - Kelly has 5 quarters. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth 5 * 25 = 125 cents.
   - Kelly also has 2 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth 2 * 10 = 20 cents.
   - Therefore, the total value of Kelly's coins is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

2. **Subtract the cost of the popcan from the total value of Kelly's coins:**
   - Kelly buys a popcan that costs 55 cents.

                [/INST] The problem is asking for the number of rows with 5 stars in a 76-star flag. The flag consists of three types of rows: 8-star rows, 6-star rows, and 5-star rows. We need to determine the number of 5-star rows based on the total number of stars.

1. Calculate the total number of stars contributed by the 8-star and 6-star rows:
   - There are 8 rows of 8 stars, which contribute 8 \* 8 = 64 stars.
   - There are 2 rows of 6 stars, which contribute 2 \* 6 = 12 stars.
   - In total, the 8-star and 6-star rows contribute 64 + 12 = 76 stars.

2. Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the remaining stars must belong to the 5-star rows:
   - Subtract the number of stars contributed by the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars: 76 - 76 = 0 stars.
   - However, this result is unusual, as it suggests that there are no remaining stars for the 5-star rows. Let's revisit the problem statement.

It turns out that there was a small mistake in the question: ""the rest are 5-star rows."" should be ""the rest are 5 stars each.""

3. Now, we'll reevaluate the problem with the correct interpretation. Since the flag has 76 stars in total, and we know that there are 8 rows of 8 stars and 2 rows of 6 stars, we need to determine how many stars can be distributed in the remaining 5-star rows while satisfying the total number of stars:
   - Subtract the number of stars contributed by the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars: 76 - (8 \* 8 + 2 \* 6) = 76 - (64 + 12) = 76 - 76 = 0 stars remaining.
   - This result implies that there are also no remaining stars for the 5-star rows. However, we must have at least one complete row of 5 stars, so let's add one more row of 5 stars to the total count:
   - Subtract the number of stars contributed by the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars, then add 5 stars for the single row of 5 stars: 76 - (8 \* 8 + 2 \* 6) + 5 = 76 - 76 + 5 = 0 + 5 = 5 stars remaining.

4. Since we have 5 stars remaining and each 5-star row requires 5 stars, there must be only 1 row of 5 stars:

\boxed{1}</s>","The rows of 8 stars have a total of: 3 rows * 8 stars/row = <<3*8=24>>24 stars.
The rows of 6 stars have a total of: 2 rows * 6 stars/row = <<2*6=12>>12 stars.
Including the rows of 8 and 6 stars, we have 24 stars + 12 stars = <<24+12=36>>36 stars.
Now we need to know how many stars are missing, 76 stars - 36 stars = <<76-36=40>>40 stars.
Now we need to distribute the missing stars in rows of 5 stars, 40 stars/5 rows = <<40/5=8>>8 rows of 5 stars.

1. First, we need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones. Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, we multiply the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck:
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000}{2000} = 3
   \]

Therefore, the landscaping company will need 3 delivery trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is $\boxed{3}$.</s>","The 80 flagstones weight 75 * 80 = <<75*80=6000>>6000 pounds.

3. You want to calculate the time it would take for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance, 480 miles.

The formula for time is:

Time = Distance / Speed

So, if we plug in the numbers for the car in the slow lane, we get:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles per hour

This simplifies to:

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ali has won 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali. So Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. The two of them together have 10 times less medals than have been given out. Let's assume the total medals given out is X.
4. Ali and Izzy together have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
5. The total number of medals is 10 times the number they have. So, X = 10 * 39 = 390 medals. However, we need to adjust this to account for the fact that they have 10 times less medals than what has been given out, not 10 times the number they have. This means the actual total number of medals given out is 10 times more than they have together.

So, the final answer is X = 390 + 10 * 39 = 390 + 390 = 780 medals.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars in the 8 packets. We do this by multiplying the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet.

Number of chocolate bars = Packets * Chocolate bars per packet
= 8 * 5
= 40

Next, let's calculate how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total. We do this by multiplying the number of adults by the number of chocolate bars each adult gets.

Chocolate bars for adults = Adults * Chocolate bars per adult
= 4 * 6
= 24

Now, subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children.

Chocolate bars for children = Total chocolate bars - Chocolate bars for adults
= 40 - 24
= 16

Since the rest of the chocolate bars are to be shared equally among the children, divide the number of chocolate bars for children by the number of children to find out how many chocolate bars each child gets.

Chocolate bars per child = Chocolate bars for children / Children
= 16 / 8
= 2

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is {2}.</s>","Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars so 8 packets contain a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 bars
Each adult gets 6 bars so 4 adults will get 6*4 = <<6*4=24>>24 bars in total
There are now 40-24 = <<40-24=16>>16 bars left
16 bars are shared equally among 8 children, so each child will get 16/8 = <<16/8=2>>2 bars

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to calculate how many tasks Susan does in the given time frame. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. for 3 hours. If she pauses every half an hour, that means she does a task every 30 minutes. In 3 hours, there are 6 half-hour intervals (3 hours * 2 = 6 half-hour intervals). So, she does 6 tasks.

2. Next, we calculate how much she earns per task. She earns $5 every 10 minutes. So, in 30 minutes (which is two 10-minute intervals), she earns 2 * $5 = $10 per task.

3. Now, we can calculate her total earnings. She does 6 tasks and earns $10 per task. So, her total earnings are 6 * $10 = $60.

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{60}$.</s>","Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.
So she works 2.5 * 60 = <<2.5*60=150>>150 minutes
She earns $5 per 10 minutes, so for the online task she earns in total 150 * 5/10=$<<150*5/10=75>>75.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.
2. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
3. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.
4. Now, we are told that in the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

\begin{split}

\end{split}

5. After the fourth round, Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points, Jim has 18 + 1 = 19 points, and Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

2. He gets home and asks his 2 sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old.
3. The oldest son is 8 years old.
4. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, which means he is 4 years old.

Now, let's calculate how many oranges each son washes:

1. The oldest son washes 8 oranges.
2. The youngest son washes 4 oranges.

Adding the oranges washed by both sons, we get:

8 oranges (oldest son) + 4 oranges (youngest son) = 12 oranges

Since 15 oranges were bought and 12 were washed (by the two sons), there are:

15 oranges - 12 oranges = 3 oranges left unwashed

So, the final answer is:

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

So, the total count of activities on the first day is:
100 (pushups) + 50 (squats) + 20 (dumbbell presses) = 170 activities

On the second day, Darren does:
- 20 more pushups than on the first day, which is 100 (first day) + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than on the first day, which is 50 (first day) - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses, which is 20 (first day) * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

So, the total count of activities on the second day is:
120 (pushups) + 40 (squats) + 40 (dumbbell presses) = 200 activities

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of rice consumed by the household per meal. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal, and there are 5 members in the household, the total consumption per meal is 5 * 0.2 = 1 kg.

2. Since the household eats rice every lunch and dinner, they consume rice twice a day. Therefore, the total daily consumption is 1 kg * 2 = 2 kg.

3. A 42 kg bag of rice will last for 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days.

4. Since there are 7 days in a week, the bag of rice will last for 21 days / 7 days/week = {3 weeks}.</s>","Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.

In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.
Thus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.

                [/INST] To calculate how many crates Sam was off from his target for the week, we need to follow the steps below:

Step 1: Calculate the total crates Sam was planning to sell for the week, which is the target. This is given as 120 crates.

Sam's target for the week = 120 crates

Step 2: Calculate the total crates Sam actually sold during the days he was open. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he worked on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. He also sold some crates over the weekend. The total crates sold on these days are given as follows:

- Sold over the weekend = 20 crates
- Sold on Tuesday = 15 crates
- Sold on Wednesday = 12 crates
- Sold on Thursday = 18 crates

So, the total crates sold when Sam was open is:

Crates sold when open = Sold over the weekend + Sold on Tuesday + Sold on Wednesday + Sold on Thursday
= 20 + 15 + 12 + 18
= 65 crates

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the target (what Sam was planning to sell) and what he actually sold when he was open. This difference will tell us by how many crates Sam was off from his target for the week.

Crates off target = Target - Crates sold when open
= 120 - 65
= {55 crates}

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week.</s>","During the whole week Sam sold 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = <<15+12+18+20=65>>65 crates.

How . much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Carmen starts bidding at $200.
2. The bids rise by $50 each time.
3. Three other people bid once each time.
4. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people.
5. Eventually, Carmen wins the desk.

We need to find out how much money Carmen spends on the desk.

Let's denote the total number of bids as ""n"". Since Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, she will make n/4 bids (because for every 4 bids, 1 is Carmen's).

The cost of the desk can be calculated by finding the total bids made (n/4 by Carmen and n/4 by each of the 3 others, which is 3n/4), multiplying the number of bids by the increment of $50.

Let's start with the initial bid of $200 and add the bids in increments of $50: $250, $300, $350...

Let's find out when Carmen wins by assuming it takes 'n' rounds of bids.

Since Carmen bids $50 more than the last person who bid, and n/4 bids were made by Carmen, we can approximate 'n' as follows:

200 + (n/4)*50 = 250 + (n/4 - 1) * 50

Simplifying the equation:

200 + 12.5n = 250 + 12.5n - 25

200 = 250 - 25

200 = 225

This doesn't work because Carmen can't win at the first bid. We need to consider the next bid in which Carmen can win if someone else bids next.

So, we try the next bid:

200 + 37.5(n+1) = 250 + 37.5(n-3)

Simplify the equation:

37.5(n+1) - 37.5(n-3) = 50

Divide both sides by 37.5:

4 - 3 = 50 / 37.5

1 = 1.333...

This doesn't work either. We need to keep adding bids and solving until we find a solution that satisfies the conditions of the problem.

Finally, we find that the bid on which Carmen wins is:

200 + 75(n+4) = 250 + 75(n-7)

Simplify the equation:

75n + 300 = 75n - 525 + 150

Add and subtract on the right side:

300 = -525 + 150 + 300

300 = -150

This is incorrect. We must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's try again from the start, but this time, let's assume that Carmen wins on the nth bid.

The initial bid is $200. Carmen's bid on the nth round is $200 + $50*(n-1).

The bidding pattern is as follows:
1. $200 (opening bid)
2. $250 (Carmen)
3. $300 (one other person)
4. $350 (Carmen)
5. $400 (one other person)
6. $450 (Carmen)
7. $500 (one other person)
... and so on.

We need to find 'n' such that Carmen's bid is $50 more than the last bid by someone else.

Let's assume the last bid before Carmen's winning bid was $X.

$X + $50 (Carmen's bid) = $200 + $50*(n-1)

Rearrange for $X:

$X = $200 + $50*(n-1) - $5","3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Daily Distance**: John lives 30 miles away from his work. Since he goes to work and back each day, the total distance he drives in a day is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles.

2. **Weekly Distance**: John goes to work 5 days a week. So, the total distance he drives in a week is 60 miles * 5 = 300 miles.

3. **Yearly Distance**: John works for 50 weeks a year. So, the total distance he drives in a year is 300 miles * 50 = 15,000 miles.

4. **Charge per Mile**: John gets charged $2 per mile driven. So, the total charge for the miles driven in a year is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

5. **Monthly Bonus**: John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus for a year is $150/month * 12 months = $1,800.

6. **Total Yearly Cost**: To find out how much John pays a year for driving, we add the total charge for the miles driven and the total bonus for a year. This is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

So, the final answer is that John pays $\boxed{\$31,800}$ a year for driving.</s>","He has to travel 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 miles per day

1. When you fold the paper vertically, you create two pages on each sheet of paper. This is because one side is folded in such a way that it has two ""pages"" on it.

2. In a 32-page tabloid, you would need half that number of sheets to cover all the pages because each sheet has two pages. So, you would need 32 divided by 2, which equals 16 sheets of paper to make 32 pages.

1. Elise has sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. The current year she has sold is 45 books. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

2. Elise has sold 90 books in the first year, 45 books in the second year, and 50 books are unsold. This means she has sold a total of 90 + 45 = 135 books.

3. The total number of books Elise had was 250. So, she sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in total.

4. The total amount of money Elise earned from selling books is the number of books sold multiplied by the price per book. That's 200 * 20 = $4000.

5. We know the total amount she earned and the number of books sold in each year. So, to find the amount she earned in the second year, we subtract her earnings from the past years from her total earnings.

6. The amount Elise earned in the second year is the total earnings minus her earnings in the first year and the current year.

7. She has sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the second year. The price per book is $20. So, her earnings in the second year are 45 * 20 = $900.

The total number of books sold in the second year is 250 of the original number of books - 135 sold books - 50 unsold books = <<250-135-50=65>>65 books.

He also gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.

In April, there are 4 weeks, so Watson would make 4 * ($500/week + $300/week) = 4 * $800/week = $3200 from his hourly wage and bonus across the month.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we start by understanding that John arm wrestles 20 people and he beats 80% of them. Let's denote the total number of people he arm wrestles as $T$ and the number of people he beats as $B$. According to the problem, we have:

1. $T = 20$ (total number of people he arm wrestles)

2. $B = 80\% \times T = 0.8 \times 20 = 16$ (number of people he beats, since he beats 80% of them)

To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beats from the total number of people he arm wrestles:

3. $L = T - B = 20 - 16 = 4$ (number of people he lost to)

Therefore, the number of people John lost to is $\boxed{4}$.</s>","He beats 20*.8=<<20*.8=16>>16 people

1. Calculate the loaves sold in the morning:
   - Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.
   - So, $\frac{2}{3} \times 60 = \frac{2 \cdot 60}{3} = 2 \cdot (20) = 40$ loaves are sold in the morning.

2. Find the loaves remaining after the morning sale:
   - Initially, there are 60 loaves.
   - After selling 40 in the morning, the remaining loaves are $60 - 40 = 20$ loaves.

3. Determine the loaves sold in the afternoon:
   - Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon.
   - Since half of 20 loaves is $\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = \frac{20}{2} = 10$ loaves, this is the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.

Thus, the final answer is that $10$ loaves are sold in the afternoon.</s>","60 x 2/3 = <<60*2/3=40>>40 loaves of bread are sold in the morning.

2. Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, which is 8 pounds.

3. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose this amount of weight. So, Sandy's weekly weight loss should be equal to Joey's, which is 2 pounds.

   $13 - $11 = $2

2. The problem states that each packet of milk now has a discount of $0.5. So, for each packet of milk, you save:

                [/INST] Sure, I'd be happy to help with that. Let's break it down:

1. The serum causes the drinker to grow an extra arm every three days.
2. The serum causes the drinker to grow an extra leg every five days.
3. We want to find out the total number of new limbs after fifteen days.

Let's calculate the number of new arms first:

1. On the first day, the person gets one extra arm.
2. On the second day, they get one more arm, making it a total of two new arms.
3. This pattern continues every three days. So, in fifteen days, there are 15/3 = 5 three-day periods.

So, the total number of new arms will be the sum of an arithmetic series from 1 to 5 (since each period adds one more arm). The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is n*(n+1)/2, where n is the number of terms. So, the number of new arms will be 5*(5+1)/2 = 15.

Now, let's calculate the number of new legs:

1. On the first five days, the person doesn't get any extra legs.
2. On the sixth day, they get one extra leg.
3. They get another leg every five days after that. So, in fifteen days, there are 15/5 = 3 five-day periods.

So, the total number of new legs will be the sum of an arithmetic series from 1 to 3 (since each period adds one more leg). Using the same formula, the number of new legs will be 3*(3+1)/2 = 6.

Finally, to find the total number of new limbs after fifteen days, we add the number of new arms and new legs together.

The final answer is {The total number of new limbs will be 15 (arms) + 6 (legs) = 21 limbs}.</s>","At one new arm every 3 days, after 15 days, a person who drank Helena’s serum would grow 15 / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 extra arms.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. First, we need to find out the total cost of the business suits and suitcases.
   Business suits cost $100 each and Theo buys 6 of them, so the cost of the business suits is 6 * $100 = $600.
   Suitcases cost $50 each and Theo buys 3 of them, so the cost of the suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150.

2. The total cost of the suits and suitcases is $600 + $150 = $750.

3. The flight ticket costs $700, so the total cost for the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket is $750 + $700 = $1450.

4. Theo wishes to spend $6000 on his trip, but he already has $1450, so he has $6000 - $1450 = $4550 to spend on other things.

5. Theo wants to save $2000 for this trip, so the amount he has left to spend after saving is $4550 - $2000 = $2550.

6. The question states that the cost of the flight ticket is more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. Let's denote the cost of a business suit as x. Then, the cost of the flight ticket is 5x + y, where y is a positive number (since the cost of the flight ticket is more than 5 times the cost of a business suit). We know that the cost of a business suit is $100, so x = $100. The cost of the flight ticket is $700, so we have the equation 5*$100 + y = $700. Solving for y gives us y = $200.

7. Therefore, the cost of the gift for a business partner is the cost of one business suit plus the cost of one flight ticket minus the cost of the business suit that costs the same as the flight ticket, which is $100 + $700 - $100 = $700.

8. Since Theo wants to buy gifts for all his business partners and he has $2550 left to spend after saving, the number of business partners he can buy gifts for is $2550 / $700.

9. Therefore, Theo can buy gifts for $\boxed{3}$  business partners.</s>","Theo buys business suits for 6 suits * $100/suit = $<<6*100=600>>600.

Theo buys a flight ticket that costs $700 + 5 * $100 = $<<700+5*100=1200>>1200.
Theo can spend $6000 - $600 - $150 - $1200 - $2000 = $<<6000-600-150-1200-2000=2050>>2050 on gifts for his friends.

                [/INST] To solve the problem step by step, let's break down the information and calculations:

1. First, we identify the number of people in the family who eat three eggs each day. The problem states that "" three people eat three eggs each day,"" which means there are 3 people eating 3 eggs each per day.

2. Next, we determine the number of people who eat two eggs each day. Since the family consists of 5 people and 3 of them eat three eggs each, the remaining number of people is $5 - 3 = 2$. These 2 people eat 2 eggs each per day.

3. To find the total number of eggs eaten by the family each day, we calculate the eggs eaten by the 3 people and the 2 people separately and then add them together:
   - The 3 people eat: $3 \times 3 = 9$ eggs per day.
   - The 2 people eat: $2 \times 2 = 4$ eggs per day.
   - Therefore, the total number of eggs eaten per day is: $9 + 4 = 13$ eggs.

4. Finally, to find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
   - Total eggs in a week: $13 \times 7 = 91$ eggs.

Thus, the family will consume $\boxed{91}$ eggs in a week.</s>","Three persons eat 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs each day.
So, 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 persons eat two eggs in a day.
Thus, 2 x 2 = 4 eggs are consumed by the two other people in a day.
So the family consumes 9 + 4 = <<9+4=13>>13 eggs each day.
Therefore, 13 x 7 = <<13*7=91>>91 eggs will be consumed by the family in a week.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

2. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so the population was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

4. Currently, the population of Chile is 1.5 times what it was six years ago (since it's twice the population six years ago, as stated in the problem), so the population now is 60,000 * 1.5 = 90,000.

\boxed{90,000}</s>","If Cera is 46 years old now, she was 46-6 = <<46-6=40>>40 years old six years ago.
Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, meaning Noah was 1/2*40 = 20 years.
If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, there were 3000*20 = <<3000*20=60000>>60000 people living in chile.
Since the population of Chile was half what it was now six years ago, currently Chile has 60000*2 = <<60000*2=120000>>120000 people

We need to find out how many players are on the defense.

Step 1: Assign variables
Let's assign a variable to represent the number of players on the defense. Let's use D for this.

Step 2: Express the number of players on offense and special teams in terms of D
According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so we can express the number of players on the offense as 2D. Similarly, there are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, so we can express the number of players on the special teams as D/2.

Step 3: Set up an equation based on the total number of players
The total number of players on the team is the sum of the number of players on the defense, offense, and special teams. This can be expressed as the equation D + 2D + D/2 = 105.

Step 4: Solve the equation for D
We can solve this equation for D by first combining like terms to get 3.5D = 105. Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3.5 to get D = 30.

So, \boxed{30} players are on the defense.</s>","Let x represent the number of players on the defense

1. First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited. She invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. So, the total number of people invited is (2*6) + (3*4) = 12 + 12 = 24 people.

2. Next, we know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, the number of people who could come is 24 - 8 = 16 people.

3. The number of people who had previous commitments is 1/4 the number of people who couldn't come due to illness. So, the number of people with previous commitments is 1/4 * 8 = 2 people.

Add those two numbers to find the total number of people Martha invited: 12 people + 12 people = <<12+12=24>>24 people
Then find the number of people who couldn't come because they were sick: 8 people / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 people

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
   {So far, Solomon has 20 marbles.}

2. It is not clear how many more marbles were added to the store or how many marbles Solomon's father gave him.

3. We know that each marble weighs 2kgs.
   {So, each marble weighs 2000g (2kgs = 2000g) since 1kgs = 1000g.}

4. We are asked to calculate the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store.

However, there seem to be some missing pieces of information that we need to figure out to solve this problem:

- How many marbles were added to the store?
- How many marbles did Solomon's father give him?

Without these pieces of information, we cannot accurately calculate the total weight of the marbles in the store. We can only say that the marbles weigh 2kgs each, but we need to know the total number of marbles to calculate the total weight.

                [/INST] First, we need to find the volume of the pool. The volume can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length x width x height. In this case, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the height is 5 feet.

Volume = length x width x height
Volume = 6 feet x 4 feet x 5 feet
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Now that we have the volume, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $.1 per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 cubic feet x $.1 per cubic foot
Cost = $12

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is {The final answer is $12}.</s>","The pool has a base of 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24 square feet

1. We know that there are 30 boys in the classroom.
2. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys. So, there are 30 * 3 = 90 girls.
3. The number of nongendered children is 1/10th of the number of boys. So, there are 30 / 10 = 3 nongendered children.
4. To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together.

So, the total number of children is 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered) = 123 children.

1. We know that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.
2. We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45.
3. To find out how many sets of poles and wires we have, we divide the total number of wires by the number of wires per set. That is, 45 / 3 = 15 sets.
4. Since each set includes 1 pole, the total number of poles needed is equal to the number of sets, which is 15.

{The final answer is: The total number of electric poles required is 15.}</s>","The total ratio representing the number of electric poles and wires is 1+3=<<1+3=4>>4

1. Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party.

2. The total number of people at the beginning of the party is 25 men + 15 women = 40 people.

3. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left the party.

4. The question asks for the number of women left if 22 men stayed at the party.

5. Since 22 men stayed, it means 3 men left the party.

6. Because the same number of men and women left the party (1/4 of the total number), the same number of women also left. So, 3 women also left.

7. Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 15 women - 3 women = 12 women.

So, the final answer is \boxed{12} women remained at the party.</s>","There were a total of 25 men + 15 women = <<25+15=40>>40 people who attended the party.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many pencils Jam has. The problem states that ""Jam has three boxes full of pencils"" and ""give a total of 26 pencils."" This means that the ""pencils"" mentioned in the previous sentence is incorrect and should be ""pencils,"" as the context suggests. So, Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, and together they contain 26 pencils. Since the boxes are full, Jam's sister Meg has 46 pencils.

2. Next, we need to determine how many boxes Jam needs to store Meg's pencils. Since the problem is about how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we know that Jam must store Meg's 46 pencils in boxes. Each of Jam's original boxes can store 26 pencils (as they are full and together they contain 26 pencils). So, to store Meg's 46 pencils, Jam would need 2 boxes (since 46 divided by 26 equals 2 with a remainder of 0).

3. Finally, we need to consider the boxes that Jam and Meg together need to store all their pencils. This includes Jam's original 3 boxes of pencils and the 2 boxes she uses to store Meg's pencils. So, they need a total of 3 + 2 = 5 boxes.

Therefore, the final answer is {Jam and Meg need a total of 5 boxes to store all their pencils}.</s>","There are a total of 26 - 2 = <<26-2=24>>24 pencils in the three boxes.

                [/INST] Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving this problem:

1. Determine the initial amount of coffee:
	* We don't know the initial amount of coffee that Shannon starts with, so we'll call that amount ""x"" milliliters.
	* Each ice cube lowers the temperature of the coffee by 13 degrees, so to lower the temperature of the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon would need approximately 65/13 = 5 ice cubes, assuming there is enough water in the initial coffee mixture to accommodate these ice cubes.
2. Consider the effect of adding ice on the coffee's volume:
	* When Shannon adds ice cubes to the coffee, the volume of the coffee mixture increases by the volume of the ice cubes. Since we know that Shannon is adding 15 milliliters of cream, we need to think about how the volume of the coffee mixture affects the problem. However, since the problem does not give us any information about the relationship between the volume of the coffee mixture and the weakness of the coffee, we'll assume that the volume of the mixture does not significantly affect the coffee's weakness.
	* When an additional milliliter of liquid (besides ice cubes) is added, the coffee weakens by 12 milliliters. To determine the total weakness of the coffee, we can simply add the initial weakness of the coffee to the additional weakness caused by adding 15 milliliters of cream.
	* We don't know the initial weakness of the coffee, so we'll call that amount ""w"".
3. Calculate the total weakness of Shannon's coffee:
	* Based on the information given, the total weakness of Shannon's coffee is w + 12 x 15 = w + 180 milliliters, assuming that the additional 15 milliliters of cream has the same effect on the coffee as adding 15 milliliters of plain liquid.

Thus, the final answer to the problem is that Shannon's coffee is w + 180 milliliters weaker when cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream. {The final answer is w + 180} milliliters.</s>","Shannon’s iced coffee has 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes in it.

If the , number of Junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and ; they are each ! paid $2000 per : month, calculate , the total amount ? of money the company pays , to all : the . programmers : per month.
                [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. The total number of people employed by the company is 100.
2. If the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, then the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * 100 = 40.
3. The total number of senior programmers would be the remaining employees, so 100 - 40 = 60.
4. Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month and senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. So, senior programmers are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.
5. To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all programmers per month, we would add the total monthly pay for junior programmers to the total monthly pay for senior programmers:
   - Total monthly pay for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Monthly pay per junior programmer = 40 * $2000 = $80,000.
   - Total monthly pay for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Monthly pay per senior programmer = 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

6. Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all programmers per month is $80,000 (junior programmers) + $144,000 (senior programmers) = $224,000.

{The final answer is \boxed{\$224,000}.}</s>","The number of junior programmers in the company is 2/5*100 = <<2/5*100=40>>40
The total amount of money that the company pays to the Junior employees is $2000*40 = $<<2000*40=80000>>80000
There are also 100-40 = <<100-40=60>>60 senior programmers in the company.
The senior programmers are paid $2000+$400 = $<<2000+400=2400>>2400 each.
Senior programmers at the company receive 2400*60 = $<<2400*60=144000>>144000 combined.
All the programmers in the company are paid a combined salary of 144000+80000 = <<144000+80000=224000>>224000

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that some people got on the bus at the terminal. Let's call this number X.

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So the total number of people on the bus became X + 5.

3. Then at the second bus stop, 7 people got down, and 8 more got in. So the total number of people on the bus became X + 5 - 7 + 8.

4. We also know that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop. This means that after the second stop, there were 20 people on the bus, because all further stops (like the third stop) would be included in ""headings to the third stop"".

5. So we can set up the equation: X + 5 - 7 + 8 = 20.

6. Solving this equation gives us X = 9.

\boxed{9} people got on the bus at the terminal.</s>","There were 20 - 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 people on the bus before 8 people got in at the second stop.
There were a total of 12 + 7 =<<12+7=19>>19 people at the second stop before 7 people went down.
So, 19 - 5 = <<19-5=14>>14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

3. He gives 14 to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends, so he buys 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

                [/INST] There seems to be some formatting issues in your question. Let's interpret the data given and solve the problem step by step:

1. The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes.
2. The phone is currently charged at 60%.
3. We need to calculate how long it will take to fully charge the phone (100%).

To solve this, we need to determine how much time it takes to charge 1 percentage point and then multiply that by the remaining percentage points needed to fully charge the phone.

1. Time for 1 percentage point = 3 minutes (given)
2. Remaining percentage points to reach 100% = 100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we calculate the total time needed:

Total time needed = Remaining percentage points * Time for 1 percentage point
= 40% * 3 minutes
= 120 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time needed into hours:

Total time needed in hours = Total time needed in minutes / Minutes per hour
= 120 minutes / 60
= 2 hours

So, the final answer is {The final answer is 2 hours}.</s>","100-60=<<100-60=40>>40 percentage points.
Then 40*3=<<40*3=120>>120 minutes to fully charge.

1. Erin initially has 7 factorial (7!) lollipops. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number, so 7! equals 7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 5040.

2. Erin's mother then gives her another 10 lollipops. So, Erin now has 5040 + 10 = 5050 lollipops.

3. Erin then gives 3 lollipops to Ella. Therefore, the number of lollipops Erin has left is 5050 - 3 = 5047.

1. The customer's reward system is $1 off their next purchase for every $20 they spend. They spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which means they earned $80 / $20 = $4 in rewards (4 rewards of $1 each).

2. On this shopping trip, they spent $43. They used their rewards, which would subtract $4 off their total.

3. They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. This means the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off the price.

4. If they used the reward first, they would subtract $4 from their total of $43, leaving them with $39.

5. Then, they applied the coupon, which subtracts another $8 from the new total of $39.

6. So, the total amount the customer paid is $39 - $8 = $31.

{The final answer is The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.}</s>","The customer had 80 / 20 = $<<80/20=4>>4 in rewards.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the annual income for each job after taxes.

For Job A:
The hourly rate is $15, and Nick works for 2000 hours a year. So, the gross annual income is $15 * 2000 = $30,000.
The state has a 20% total tax rate, so the annual income after taxes is $30,000 - ($30,000 * 0.20) = $24,000.

For Job B:
The state charges $6,000 in property tax. So, the net income is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
The state has a 10% tax rate on net income, so the annual income after taxes is $36,000 - ($36,000 * 0.10) = $32,400.

Now, let's compare the net annual income for both jobs.

The difference between the net incomes is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

So, Nick will make \boxed{$8,400 more} at the job with a higher net pay rate compared to the other job.</s>","First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000
Next, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000
Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400
Now subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400

                [/INST] To find the number of ruined castles in Scotland, we first need to calculate the number of castles that are ruined. Since 40% of the castles are ruins, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of ruined castles = Total number of castles * Percentage of ruined castles
                                 = 220 * 0.4
                                 = 88

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unstaffed. Since half of the ruined castles are unstaffed, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of unstaffed ruined castles = Number of ruined castles / 2
                                                = 88 / 2
                                                = 44

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of Furniture United's offer**
- Robert pays an initial amount of $1,350.
- Then, he has to pay 6 monthly installments of $350 each.
- So, the total cost from Furniture United = Initial payment + (Monthly payment * Number of installments)
- Total cost from Furniture United = $1,350 + ($350 * 6) = $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer**
- Robert pays an initial amount of $1,100.
- Then, he has to pay 9 monthly installments of $250 each.
- So, the total cost from Cozy Homes = Initial payment + (Monthly payment * Number of installments)
- Total cost from Cozy Homes = $1,100 + ($250 * 9) = $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

**Step 3: Find the difference between the two offers**
- Difference = Total cost from Cozy Homes - Total cost from Furniture United
- Difference = $3,350 - $3,450 = -$100

So, the difference between the two offers is $-100, which means Furniture United's offer is $100 more expensive than Cozy Homes'.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. Since Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 3 times 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Step 2: Find out how many hot dogs John ate.
John ate half the amount Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate 6 hot dogs, John ate 6/2 = 3 hot dogs.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to use algebra and our understanding of basic arithmetic.

First, let's consider that all the groups are equal in number, except for the smallest one, which has 10 less students than the other two. Also, since the total number of students is 200, and there are 3 groups, the total number of students should be 3 times the number of students in one group. This can be represented as:

200 = 3 * (x + 10)

Where x is the number of students in the smallest group.

Solving for x, we first divide both sides of the equation by 3:

200 / 3 = x + 10

So,

x = (200 / 3) - 10

Calculating this value, we get:

x = 66.67 - 10 = 56.67

Since the number of students in a group must be a whole number, and the smallest group (x) is 10 less than the other larger groups, it's possible to round up to the nearest whole number because rounding down would result in negative numbers for the larger groups.

So,

x = 57

Therefore, {The smallest group has 57 students}.</s>","If 10 is added to the smallest group (hence to the total number of students), it would make all 3 groups equal to give (200+10)/3 = <<(200+10)/3=70>>70 in each group.
Now taking the 10 away from one group gives the number of the smallest group as 70-10 = <<70-10=60>>60 students.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. We know that Farmer Brown has 60 animals. These animals are either chickens or cows.

2. We also know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as 2C (since there are twice as many chickens).

3. The total number of animals is given by the sum of the number of chickens and the number of cows. So, we have the equation C + 2C = 60.

4. Simplifying this equation gives us 3C = 60. Solving for C gives us C = 60 / 3 = 20. So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows.

5. Since the number of chickens is twice the number of cows, Farmer Brown has 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

6. Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is 4 * (number of cows) + 2 * (number of chickens) = 4 * 20 + 2 * 40.

7. Simplifying this gives us 80 + 80 = 160.

So, the final answer is \boxed{160}.</s>","There are 60*(2/3)=<<60*(2/3)=40>>40 chickens.
There are 60-40=<<60-40=20>>20 cows.
The chickens have 40*2=<<40*2=80>>80 legs.
The cows have 20*4=<<20*4=80>>80 legs.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A blue beetle, a green toad, and the pink frog all weigh the same. So, the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds each.
3. The yellow snake is 10 pounds heavier than the pink frog. So, the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The red bird is 20 pounds lighter than the pink frog. So, the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals:

Weight of the pink frog = 50 pounds
Weight of the blue beetle = 50 pounds
Weight of the green toad = 50 pounds
Weight of the yellow snake = 60 pounds
Weight of the red bird = 30 pounds

Total weight of the animals = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

The container itself weighs 20 pounds. So, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal would be:

Total weight = Weight of the animals + Weight of the container
Total weight = 240 + 20 = 260 pounds

{The final answer is 260 pounds}</s>","Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.
The pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.
If you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.
The pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.
All the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds
If the animals are in a container weighing 20 pounds, the total weight of the full container is 240+20 = 260 pounds

So, Tyson will run 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day if he follows his coach's advice.

June has 30 days. If Tyson runs 6000 meters every day for a month, then the total distance he covers in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

There are 12 months in a year, so Madeline spends $45 * 12 = $540 per year on treats and medicine.

Adding the annual cost of dog food, which is $100 * 12 = $1200, the total amount of money Madeline spends on her dog in a year is $540 + $1200 = $1740.

So, the final answer is {Madeline spends $1740 on her dog in a year}.</s>","Madeline spends$25*4=$<<25*4=100>>100 on food for her dog per month.

How many , hours will all Peyton’s after-work . activities take?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Peyton spends on each after-work activity and then add them up.

1. Yoga class on Monday: 1 hour
2. Cooking class on Tuesday: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga = 3 * 1 = 3 hours
3. Cheese-tasting event on Wednesday: 30 minutes = 0.5 hours
4. Museum tour on Thursday: Half as long as the cooking class = 1/2 * 3 = 1.5 hours
5. Errands on Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours:

Total time = 1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday)
= 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2
= 8 hours

{The final answer is 8 hours.}</s>","Peyton’s cooking class will last 3 * 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours.
The museum tour will take 3 / 2 = 1 1/2 hours.

                [/INST] April initially bought 100 plant pots. She then needs to donate 30 for daisies and twice as many for roses, which means she needs 60 plant pots for roses.

So, the total number of plant pots April needs to donate is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Subtracting the number of plant pots she had already bought from the total number of plant pots she needs to donate, we get 100 (total plant pots) - 90 (plant pots needed) = 10 plant pots.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

{The final answer is 10 plant pots left over.}</s>","For the roses, the school wants 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 plant pots.
This means she is giving the school 60 plant pots for roses + 30 plant pots for daisies = <<60+30=90>>90 plant pots.
So in total, Alice has 100 – 90 = <<100-90=10>>10 plant pots left over.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Andrea initially had $36.
2. She saved some money. We don't know how much she saved yet, so let's call this amount S.
3. After saving, her total money became $36 - S.
4. Then, she spent $11 on a sweater, leaving her with $36 - S - $11 = $25 - S.
5. Finally, she gave her brother $4, so her final amount is $25 - S - $4 = $21 - S.

The question asks how much Andrea saved (S). To find this, we can work backwards from her final amount:

1. We know that after giving her brother $4, she had $21 - S left.
2. Before that, she had $21 - S + $4 = $25 - S.
3. Prior to buying the sweater, she had $25 - S + $11 = $36 - S.

Since she initially had $36, we can set up the equation:

25 - S + 11 = 36

Solving for S:

36 - 25 = S

S = 11

So, Andrea saved $11.

Final answer: Andrea saved $11. {The final answer is \boxed{11}}</s>","Andrea spent and gave her brother a total of $11 + $4 = $<<11+4=15>>15.

1. John spends 6 hours boating. Half of that time is spent swimming, so he spends 3 hours swimming.
2. He watches 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spends 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.
3. These shows take up 30% of his time, so the total time spent on activities (boating, swimming, and watching shows) is 3 * the total time.
4. Therefore, the total time spent on these activities is 6 hours / 0.3 = 20 hours.
5. This means John spends 20 hours on boating, swimming, and watching shows, and the rest of his time sightseeing.
6. John spends 40% of his time sightseeing.
7. Therefore, the total time John spends sightseeing is 0.4 * (total time).
8. However, we already know that John spends 20 hours on boating, swimming, and watching shows.
9. So, the time John spends sightseeing is the total time minus the 20 hours spent on other activities.
10. The total time is 4 * 20 (since he spent 20 hours on 3 activities, and 40% of his time was spent sightseeing).
11. So, John spends 4 * 20 - 20 = 60 hours sightseeing.

Final answer: John spent 60 hours sightseeing. {The final answer is \boxed{60}}.</s>","He spent 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours swimming

1. Calculate how much money Annabelle made from her first job.
   She earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work, so she made 10*20 = $200.

2. Calculate how much money Annabelle made from her second job.
   She earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work, so she made 5*15 = $75.

3. Add the money she made from both jobs to the money she already had in her savings.
   She had $80 in her savings, made $200 from her first job, and made $75 from her second job. So, she has 80 + 200 + 75 = $355.

4. Subtract the total amount she now has from the cost of the phone she wants to buy.

2. She also wants to have $5 in arcade tokens. This cost is already included in her arcade tokens.

3. She wants to ride the go-karts twice. Since each go-kart ride costs $10, this will cost her $20.

4. Morgan has a budget of $90 for her birthday party.

Now, let's calculate how much budget is left for Morgan's friends:

1. Subtract Morgan's personal costs from her total budget: $90 - ($5 + $5 + $20) = $90 - $30 = $60.

This $60 is what Morgan can spend on her friends.

Morgan wants to make sure that she and her friends can get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. Therefore, the total cost for each person (including Morgan) is $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $30.

Now, let's calculate how many friends Morgan can invite:

                [/INST] First, let's find out how much money Billy has left after buying the candy. The cost of one pound of candy is $1.5 and Billy has $10. We don't know how many pounds of candy he bought, so let's denote that by x.

So, the cost of x pounds of candy is 1.5x and the money left after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x.

Next, let's find out how much money Billy has left after buying the gumballs. He takes half of his change after buying candy and spends it on gumballs. Each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40 gumballs, so he spent 40 * $0.05 = $2 on gumballs.

So, the money left after buying gumballs is (10 - 1.5x) / 2 - 2.

Since the money left after buying gumballs is equal to the money spent on gumballs, we have:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 - 2 = 2

Now, let's solve for x:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2 + 2

(10 - 1.5x) = 4 + 4 * 2

10 - 1.5x = 8

1.5x = 10 - 8

1.5x = 2

x = 2 / 1.5

x = 4 / 3

So, Billy bought 4/3 pounds of candy.

The final answer is {4/3 pounds of candy} or {approximately 1.33 pounds of candy}.</s>","He spent $2 on gumballs because 40 x .05 = <<40*.05=2>>2

1. Carver is 45 years old.
2. Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. If we were to find twice the age of his son, we would subtract 5 years from the age of Carver.

Let's denote the son's age as S. According to the problem:

45 - 5 = 2S

40 = 2S

3. Now, to find the son's age, we divide both sides by 2:

S = 40 / 2

S = 20

The final answer is:

{The son is 20 years old}</s>","Let x be the age of Carver's son.
Since Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, then 45=(2*x)-5.

Thus, the age of Carver's son is x=25 years old.

First, let's find the combined distance of the first two trips:
75 miles (first to second city) + 100 miles (second to third city) = 175 miles

Now, let's find the distance between the third and first city:
175 miles (combined distance of the first two trips) - 50 miles = 125 miles

So, the train travels 75 miles, 100 miles, and 125 miles for one round trip.

Next, let's calculate the total distance for one round trip:
75 miles (first to second city) + 100 miles (second to third city) + 125 miles (third to first city) = 300 miles

Since the train does this trip three times a day, let's find the total distance it travels in a day:
300 miles (one round trip) x 3 (three times a day) = 900 miles per day

Now, let's determine how many days the train goes between services:
18,000 miles (service interval) ÷ 900 miles per day = 20 days

Therefore, the train goes between services every 20 days.

{The final answer is 20 days.}</s>","It takes 100+75=<<100+75=175>>175 miles for the first two legs of the trip
The third leg is 175-50=<<175-50=125>>125 miles
So the total trip is 175+125=<<175+125=300>>300 miles
So it goes 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 miles per day
So it can go 18000/900=<<18000/900=20>>20 days between services.

How many ; pounds of ? stuffing does Mark , need to ? make 4 chihuahua beds ; and 3 collie beds?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. Since it takes the average amount of stuffing between the first two kinds of beds, we add the amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed and a Chihuahua bed, then divide by 2.
   Stuffing for a collie bed = (Stuffing for a Rottweiler bed + Stuffing for a Chihuahua bed) / 2
   Substituting the given values:
   Stuffing for a collie bed = (8 pounds + 2 pounds) / 2 = 10 pounds

2. Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 Chihuahua beds and 3 Collie beds.
   Total stuffing needed = (Stuffing for 1 Chihuahua bed * Number of Chihuahua beds) + (Stuffing for 1 Collie bed * Number of Collie beds)
   Substituting the values:
   Total stuffing needed = (2 pounds * 4) + (10 pounds * 3) = 8 pounds + 30 pounds = 38 pounds

So, \boxed{38} pounds of stuffing are needed to make 4 Chihuahua beds and 3 Collie beds.</s>","First, find the total amount of stuffing in one Rottweiler bed and one chihuahua bed: 2 pounds + 8 pounds = <<2+8=10>>10 pounds

Then find the amount of stuffing in 4 chihuahua beds: 2 pounds/bed * 4 beds = <<2*4=8>>8 pounds
Then find the amount of stuffing in 3 collie beds: 5 pounds/bed * 3 beds = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds
Then add the two amounts of stuffing to find the total amount of stuffing needed: 8 pounds + 15 pounds = <<8+15=23>>23 pounds

1. First, we need to calculate the total distance John traveled. He drove 200 miles to his friend's house, then took a detour of 10 miles, and finally drove 240 miles home. So, the total distance is 200 + 10 + 240 = 450 miles.

2. Next, we need to find out how long it took him to travel to his friend's house. He drove at a speed of 70 mph. So, the time taken is the total distance divided by the speed, which is 410 miles (200 + 10) divided by 70 mph. This equals 5.857 hours.

3. Now, we need to find out how long it took him to drive home. He drove at a speed of 80 mph. So, the time taken is the total distance divided by the speed, which is 240 miles divided by 80 mph. This equals 3 hours.

4. Finally, we add the time taken to drive to his friend's house and the time taken to drive home to find the total time for the trip. So, 5.857 hours + 3 hours = 8.857 hours.

                [/INST] First, let's find out the total number of fourth-grade students at Small Tree School. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total.

1. The total number of fourth-graders = 96

Next, let's find out how many fourth-grade girls and boys were absent on Friday. We know that 5 fourth-grade girls and 4 fourth-grade boys were absent.

2. Fourth-grade girls absent = 5
3. Fourth-grade boys absent = 4

Since the total number of girls in the fourth grade is 43, we can find out how many girls were present on Friday by subtracting the number of girls who were absent from the total number of girls.

4. Fourth-grade girls present = Total fourth-grade girls - Fourth-grade girls absent
   = 43 - 5
   = 38

Now, let's find out how many students were present on Friday. We know that the total number of students is 96, so we can subtract the number of students who were absent (9 - remember, 5 girls and 4 boys were absent, so 9 students in total were absent) from the total number of students.

5. Students present = Total students - Students absent
   = 96 - 9
   = 87

Finally, let's find out how many fourth-grade boys were present on Friday. We know that the total number of students present is 87, and the number of girls present is 38. So, we can subtract the number of girls present from the total number of students present to find the number of boys present, and then subtract the number of boys absent from that number to find the final answer.

6. Fourth-grade boys present = Students present - Girls present - Boys absent
   = 87 - 38 - 4
   = 45

So, the final answer is that there were 45 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

The final answer is {45}.</s>","Of the 96 fourth graders, 43 are girls, so 96 students - 43 girls = <<96-43=53>>53 boys.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Three customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A certain number equals four times that number minus 5. However, we don't know yet what that number is, so we can't solve this part yet.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since we don't know how many were kicked out for shoplifting yet, we can't solve this part either.
4. A total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart.

Now, let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as M, the number of shoplifters as S, and the number of people kicked out for physical violence as V. We know that M + S + V = 50.

We also know that M = 3 (from point 1), and V = 3S (from point 3).

Substituting M = 3 into the first equation gives us 3 + S + V = 50, which simplifies to S + V = 47.

Substituting V = 3S into S + V = 47 gives us S + 3S = 47, which simplifies to 4S = 47.

Solving for S gives us S = 47 / 4, which is not a whole number. This means there's a mistake in the problem statement because the number of shoplifters must be a whole number.

However, if we assume that the problem meant to say that four times the number of shoplifters minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting, then the equation becomes 4S - 5 = S (because the people who were physically violent are included in the shoplifters). Solving for S gives us S = 5.

Substituting S = 5 into V = 3S gives us V = 3 * 5 = 15.

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is the total number of people minus those who were kicked out for refused to wear masks and those who were physically violent. This is 50 - 3 - 15 = 32.

Therefore, 32 people were kicked out for other reasons.

                [/INST] First, let's understand the current state. Erin has 3 times more points than Sara currently.

So, let's denote Erin's current points as E and Sara's current points as S.

The problem states that Erin's (E) points are 14 and Sara's (S) points are 8.

The problem also states that Erin has 3 times more points than Sara. So, we can express this as E = 3*S.

But we know that E (Erin's points) is 14 and S (Sara's points) is 8. So, we can substitute these values into the equation:

14 = 3*8

Solving this gives us 16 as the value of E which is not correct according to the problem statement. This is because the problem states that Erin currently has three times more points than Sara, not three times.

So, Erin's points (E) before scoring 14 points were 3 times Sara's points (S), which was 8.

So, E = 3*8 = 24

1. Picture frames: Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20. Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for the picture frames is:
   Cost_frames = Number of seniors * Cost per frame
   Cost_frames = 44 * $20
   Cost_frames = $880

2. Etching cost: Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo, which adds an additional 20% cost per frame. So, the total etching cost is:
   Etching_cost = Cost_frames * (20/100)
   Etching_cost = $880 * (20/100)
   Etching_cost = $176

3. Pins: 2 seniors will receive pins that are $5 each. So, the total pin cost is:
   Pin_cost = Number of seniors receiving pins * Cost per pin
   Pin_cost = 2 * $5
   Pin_cost = $10

4. Cords: 1/4 of the seniors, which is (1/4) * 44 = 11 seniors, are officers and they will need cords that are $12 each. So, the total cord cost is:
   Cord_cost = Number of seniors who are officers * Cost per cord
   Cord_cost = 11 * $12
   Cord_cost = $132

5. Total cost: Now, we add up all the costs to get the total cost of the senior gifts:
   Total_cost = Cost_frames + Etching_cost + Pin_cost + Cord_cost
   Total_cost = $880 + $176 + $10 + $132

                [/INST] The idea is to find out the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper.

First, let's determine how much Ethan saved from buying the pre-made wallpaper. This is given in the question as 20% of the market cost.

Market cost is $400, so the saving would be 20% of this which is calculated as follows:

Saving = Market price * Percentage (in decimal)
     = $400 * 0.20
     = $80

So, Ethan would have saved $80 by making his own wallpaper.

Next step is to find out the total cost when considering the savings. But because he made his own wallpaper, all the money would go into materials. Hence, there should be no savings.

So, the total cost of hand-painted wallpaper that Ethan has made, would still equal the pre-made wallpaper market cost.

Therefore, the total cost was still $400.

The final answer is: $400 was the total cost.</s>","A DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost, meaning you will save 20/100*$400=$<<20/100*400=80>>80 if you make your own hand-painted wallpaper.

1. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs of shoes.

3. On Sunday, they sold one-half of the amount they did the day before. Since they sold 28 pairs on Saturday, one-half of that would be 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

4. However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. Since each return corresponds to one pair, this means 6 pairs were returned.

5. To find the total number of shoes sold by the end of the sale, we add the shoes sold on each day and then subtract the shoes that were returned:

Total shoes sold = Shoes sold on Friday + Shoes sold on Saturday + Shoes sold on Sunday - Shoes returned
   = 14 + 28 + 14 - 6

1. Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. That's a total of 3 hours on those two days.

2. On Saturdays, her dance practice lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class. Since Tuesday's class was 1 hour long, Saturday's class would have been 2 hours long (1 hour * 2).

3. Now, let's add Saturday's practice time to the total we already have: 3 hours (Tuesday and Thursday combined) + 2 hours (Saturday) = 5 hours.

\boxed{5} hours a week did she have dance practice.</s>","She had practice for 1 hour on Tuesday and 2 hours on Thursday so she practiced for 1+2 = <<1+2=3>>3 hours

1. The total cost of the equipment is $400,000.
2. 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. This means that 60% of the pieces were functioning.
3. To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to calculate 60% of the total cost.

Total cost of functioning equipment = Total cost * Percentage of functioning equipment
= $400,000 * 60%
= $400,000 * 0.60 (since 60% is equivalent to 0.60 as a decimal)
= $240,000

So, the company spent $240,000 on functioning pieces of equipment.

{The final answer is \boxed{240000}}</s>","If 40% worth of the pieces of equipment bought were faulty and were returned, the amount of money they were bought for is 40/100*$400000 = $<<40/100*400000=160000>>160000
Since the faulty pieces of equipment were worth $400000, the functioning equipment was worth $400000-$160000 = $<<400000-160000=240000>>240000

1. Mary has 30 sheep.
2. Half of the sheep provide 1 kg of milk each. So, the number of sheep that provide 1 kg of milk is half of 30, which is 15.
3. The other half of the sheep provide 2 kg of milk each. So, the number of sheep that provide 2 kg of milk is also 15.
4. The total amount of milk collected from the sheep that provide 1 kg of milk is 15 * 1 kg = 15 kg.
5. The total amount of milk collected from the sheep that provide 2 kg of milk is 15 * 2 kg = 30 kg.
6. The total amount of milk collected every day is 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

3. This leaves us with 40 - 20 = 20 pupils who don't like blue.

4. Now, one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. One-fourth of 20 is 5.

5. This means there are 20 - 5 = 15 pupils left.

1. Lucy sells each apple for $4, and she sold all the apples she picked on Monday for a total of $56. So, the number of apples she picked on Monday is $56 / $4 = 14 apples.

2. On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday. So, she picked 12 * 2 = 24 apples.

4. Therefore, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples.

{The final answer is} Lucy picked over 50 apples over the three days.</s>","Since each apple costs $4, it means that on Monday, Lucy picked 56/4 = <<56/4=14>>14 apples

1. Lindsay has a total of 50 socks that need washing.
2. She washes 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair has 2 socks, that means she washed 10*2 = 20 socks.
3. She also washed 15 loose socks.
4. So, she washed a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks.
5. If we subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks that need washing, we get 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks.

{The final answer is: 15}</s>","Splitting the pairs shows there were 10 pairs of socks * 2 socks/pair = <<10*2=20>>20 socks paired together.

1. Rachel initially bought 23 cookies.

2. Then, Janet gave her another 42 cookies. So, the total number of cookies Rachel has after receiving cookies from Janet is 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.

3. Rachel's brother ate 44% of those cookies. To find out how many cookies were eaten, we calculate 44% of 65. In decimal form, 44% is 0.44, so 0.44 * 65 = 28.6. Since we can't have a fraction of a cookie, we round this to the nearest whole number, which is 29 cookies.

4. Now, to find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies Rachel had after receiving cookies from Janet. So, 65 - 29 = 36 cookies.

                [/INST] To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she has to pay for the five months.

1. The total interest for five months is calculated as follows:
Total Interest = Principal Amount * Interest Rate * Time
Total Interest = $3,650 * 10/100 * 5
Total Interest = $365 * 5
Total Interest = $1,825

2. Now, we need to add this total interest to the principal amount to find out the total amount she has to pay at the end of the five months.
Total Amount = Principal Amount + Total Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

3. Since she has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find out the monthly payment.
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

Therefore, Karan has to pay $1,095 every month.

{The final answer is: \boxed{1,095}}</s>","Karan's interest is $3,650 × 0.1 = $<<3650*0.1=365>>365.

2. Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked. Chloe's speed is 9 kilometers per hour and she hiked for 5 hours. So, Chloe hiked 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers.

3. Now, we need to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked than Chloe. This is simply the difference between the distances they hiked. So, Cho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

1. Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.
2. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.
3. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.
4. To find the total number of pesos they have together, we add Axel's and Anna's silver pesos and gold pesos: (50 + 100) silver pesos + (80 + 120) gold pesos.
5. This simplifies to 150 silver pesos + 200 gold pesos.

Since we can't add silver pesos and gold pesos together directly, we need to specify the final answer in terms of two separate values.

1. Millie spends $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so the total number of cups she can make is 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

2. She sells each cup for $1, so the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

3. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour. So, the number of hours she needs to sell to make $36 is $36 / $1/cup = 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem:

1. Mr. Rutherford sold 3/5 of his land, which means he was left with 2/5 of his land. This is because when you subtract the 3/5s that were sold from the total 1s (which represent the whole land), you are left with 2/5s.

2. The remaining land is 12.8 hectares, and this is 2/5 of the total land he had.

3. To find out how much land he had at first, we need to find out what 1s (the whole land) would be in this context. If 2/5s correspond to 12.8 hectares, then 1s (which would be the whole land) would be 5 times more.

So, let's calculate:

1 -> 5 * 12.8 hectares = 64 hectares

Therefore, the final answer is: The original land area was 64 hectares. {The final answer is 64 hectares}</s>","Mr. Ruther is left with 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.
Since 2/5 is equal to 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 is equal to 12.8/2 = <<12.8/2=6.4>>6.4 hectares.
Hence, Mr. Ruther had 6.4 x 5 = <<6.4*5=32>>32 hectares of land at first.

                [/INST] First, let's find out how many boys and girls are in the choir.

Since the choir has 52 members and 50% of them are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
Number of boys = Total members * Percentage of boys
= 52 * 0.5
= 26

Similarly, the number of girls can be calculated as follows:
Number of girls = Total members - Number of boys
= 52 - 26
= 26

Now, let's find out how many girls can perform on the day of the performance. Since half of the girls can't make it to the show, only half of the girls can perform.
Number of girls performing = Number of girls / 2
= 26 / 2
= 13

Finally, the 3 teachers decide to sing with them, so we add the number of teachers to the number of girls performing.
Total number of people singing = Number of girls performing + Number of teachers
= 13 + 3

1. First, we need to calculate the total cost of 6 erasers. The cost of one eraser is $2, so the cost of 6 erasers would be 6 times $2.
   Cost of 6 erasers = 6 * $2 = $12

2. Next, we calculate the total cost of 8 pencils. The cost of one pencil is $3, so the cost of 8 pencils would be 8 times $3.
   Cost of 8 pencils = 8 * $3 = $24

3. Finally, we add the cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils to find the total cost.
   Total cost = Cost of 6 erasers + Cost of 8 pencils
   Total cost = $12 + $24 = $36

Step 1: First, let's find the total parts in the given ratio.
The ratio of popsicles is 5:6. Adding these together gives us the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Step 2: Next, we need to find out how many popsicles each part represents.
To do this, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total parts in the ratio. So, 165 popsicles ÷ 11 parts = 15 popsicles per part.

Step 3: Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have.
Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

Step 4: Finally, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has to find out how many more popsicles he has.
So, 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles.

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus before the discount. Each costs $10 per month, so together they would cost $20.

2. Next, we need to calculate the discounted price for Hulu and Disney Plus when they are bundled. There is a 20% discount on these two services. So, 20% of $20 is $4.

3. Therefore, after the discount, Hulu and Disney Plus together cost $20 - $4 = $16 per month.

4. Now, let's calculate the total cost per month for Tim's new setup: Netflix at $10, and the discounted Hulu and Disney Plus at $16, which adds up to $26.

5. Tim was previously paying $60 per month for his cable package.

6. So, to find out how much Tim saves per month by switching to streaming services, we subtract his new monthly cost from his old monthly cost: $60 - $26 = $34.

7. Finally, to find out how much Tim saves overall by switching to streaming services, we need to multiply his monthly savings by the number of months he was paying for his cable package, but since we are not given a specific number of months, we'll calculate the monthly savings.

\boxed{The final answer is a monthly saving of $34.}</s>","Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's convert all the given times into minutes. Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 4 hours is equivalent to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

2. Carol spends half that time recording it. So, the time spent on recording is 240 / 2 = 120 minutes.

3. We know that Carol spends 90 minutes editing the song.

4. Now, we need to find the total time spent on the project. This is the sum of the times spent writing, recording, and editing. So, the total time is 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes.

5. The question asks for the percentage of total work time spent editing. The time spent editing is 90 minutes, so the percentage is (time spent editing / total time) * 100.

6. Therefore, the percentage of total work time spent editing is (90 / 450) * 100 = 20%.

Now, we need to know how many books can fit in the system:

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 books can fit in the system.

Since Wendy needs 60 books and the system can only fit 36 books, she will need to carry the remaining books in her carry case:

60 (total books) - 36 (books that fit in the system) = 24 books.

                [/INST] Step 1: Identify the number of spiders Nancy saw.
The number of spiders is given as 90.

Step 2: Calculate the number of millipedes.
The problem states that the number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as spiders. So we calculate it as follows:
Number of millipedes = (1/3) * Number of spiders
= (1/3) * 90
= 30

Step 3: Calculate the number of stink bugs.
The problem states that the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So we calculate it as follows:
Number of stink bugs = 2 * Number of millipedes - 12
= 2 * 30 - 12
= 60 - 12
= 48

Step 4: Calculate the total number of bugs.
The total number of bugs is the sum of the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs. So we calculate it as follows:
Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
= 90 + 30 + 48
= 168

So, Nancy counted a total of 168 bugs.

The final answer is \boxed{168}</s>","First find the number of millipedes: 90 spiders / 3 spiders/millipede = <<90/3=30>>30 millipedes

2. Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
3. Erica is 30 years old.

First, we need to find Beth's age. Since Erica is 30 and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age as follows:

Beth's age = Erica's age + 5 years
Beth's age = 30 years + 5 years
Beth's age = 35 years

Now that we have Beth's age, we can find Alice's age. Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, we can calculate Alice's age as follows:

Alice's age = Beth's age + 7 years
Alice's age = 35 years + 7 years
Alice's age = 42 years

Finally, to find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age:

Difference = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference = 42 years - 30 years
Difference = 12 years

{The final answer is the difference in ages between Alice and Erica, which is 12 years.}</s>","Beth is 30+5 = <<30+5=35>>35 years old.
Alice is 35+7 = <<35+7=42>>42 years old.
The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42-30 = <<42-30=12>>12 years.

1. First, we need to determine the total amount of milk John drinks. He drinks 2 glasses, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the total amount of milk is 2 * 8 = 16 ounces.

2. Next, we need to calculate the total number of calories John consumes. We know that milk has 3 calories per ounce. So, to find the total calories, we multiply the total amount of milk (in ounces) by the calories per ounce.

Total calories = Total amount of milk * Calories per ounce
= 16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce
= 48 calories

So, John consumes 48 calories.

1. The builder works for 4 weeks every month.

2. There are 12 months in a year.

3. Therefore, the total number of months the builder works in a year is 12.

4. So, the total number of weeks the builder works in a year is 12 months * 4 weeks/month = 48 weeks.

5. The builder works for 6 days every week.

6. Therefore, the total number of days the builder works in a year is 48 weeks * 6 days/week = 288 days.

7. The builder gets paid $50 every day.

8. Therefore, the total amount the builder earns in a year is 288 days * $50/day = $14,400.

\boxed{The final answer is $14,400.}</s>","The builder works for 6 days every week and works for 4 weeks every month so he works for 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = <<6*4=24>>24 days/month

1. First, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy for his quadruple batch of brownies.
   - For flour: The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour. Since each bag contains 2 cups, Mark needs to buy 2 bags of flour for 4 cups of flour (which is the quadruple amount).
   - For milk: The normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk. Since each bottle contains 2 cups, Mark needs to buy half a bottle of milk for 0.5 cups of milk (which is the quadruple amount). However, since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we'll consider this as 1 bottle of milk.

2. Now, we can compare the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.
   - Mark needs to buy 2 bags of flour and 1 bottle of milk.
   - To find out how many more bags of flour Mark has to buy than bottles of milk, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 2 - 1 = 1.

So, Mark has to buy 1 more bag of flour than bottles of milk.

{The final answer is: Mark has to buy 1 more bag of flour than bottles of milk.}</s>","To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 3 cups * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cups of flour.
To get 12 cups of flour, Mark needs to buy: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = <<12/2=6>>6 bags
To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 1 cup * 4 = <<1*4=4>>4 cups of milk
To get 4 cups of milk, Mark needs to buy: 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = <<4/2=2>>2 bottles of milk
Finally, subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour to find the difference: 6 - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner. We need to convert this into kilowatts because the final answer requires the energy saved to be in kilowatts. There are 1000 watts in a kilowatt, so 900 watts is 0.9 kilowatts.

2. The air conditioner is used for 8 hours a day. So, in one day, the AC uses 0.9 kilowatts * 8 hours = 7.2 kilowatts of energy.

3. If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the AC is used for 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours a day. So, in one day, the AC uses 0.9 kilowatts * 3 hours = 2.7 kilowatts of energy.

4. The energy saved in one day is the difference in energy used when the AC is used for 8 hours and when it's used for 3 hours. That's 7.2 kilowatts - 2.7 kilowatts = 4.5 kilowatts.

5. Finally, to find out the energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by the number of days. That's 4.5 kilowatts * 30 days = 135 kilowatts.

So, Mel will save {135 kilowatts} of electric energy in 30 days.</s>","An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.
An air conditioner uses 900 x 5 = <<900*5=4500>>4500 watts for 5 hours a day.
So, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.
That is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.
Hence, in 30 days he will have 2.7 x 30 = <<2.7*30=81>>81 kilowatts of electric energy saved.

Step 1: Identify the number of stripes on each zebra.
- The first zebra has 17 stripes.
- The second zebra has 36 stripes.
- The third zebra has half as many stripes as the second zebra, which is 36/2 = 18 stripes.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of stripes.
- This is done by adding up the number of stripes on each zebra: 17 + 36 + 18 = 71 stripes.

Step 3: Calculate the average number of stripes.
- This is done by dividing the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 71 stripes / 3 zebras.

Step 4: Perform the division.
- 71 divided by 3 equals approximately 23.67. However, since we're dealing with whole numbers (zebras can't have fractional stripes), we'll round to the nearest whole number.

So, the zebras have an average of about \boxed{24} stripes each.</s>","First find the number of stripes the last zebra has: 36 stripes / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 stripes

Then add the number of stripes the last two zebras have: 18 stripes + 34 stripes + 36 stripes = <<18+34+36=88>>88 stripes
Then divide the number of stripes by the number of zebras to find the average number of stripes per zebra: 88 stripes / 4 zebras = <<88/4=22>>22 stripes/zebra

1. Tyson needs to make enough sandwiches for 20 people.
2. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and cheese.
3. So, he needs to prepare 20 sandwiches.
4. That means he needs 20 pounds of meat and 20 pounds of cheese.
5. The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound. So, for 20 pounds, he'll need 20 * $7 = $140.
6. The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. So, for 20 pounds, he'll need 20 * $3 = $60.
7. To find the total cost, you add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese together: $140 + $60 = $200.

2. He has a total of 40 cannolis in his house.
3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store.
4. He has 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis.

Now let's calculate the number of corns Allan originally had:

1. Allan's cannolis = 40
2. Allan's corn = twice the number of cannolis = 2 * 40 = 80 corns

After buying more cannolis, the total number of cannolis becomes:

1. Initial cannolis = 40
2. Additional cannolis = 60
3. Total cannolis = Initial cannolis + Additional cannolis = 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis

Let's now calculate the number of corns after buying more cannolis:

1. Allan's corn = 80
2. Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the number of corns is 40 fewer than the new number of cannolis = 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Finally, let's calculate the combined total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house:

1. Total corns = 60
2. Total cannolis = 100
3. Combined total = Total corns + Total cannolis = 60 + 100 = 160

When he bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, he bought 60 corn - 40 corn = <<60-40=20>>20 corns
In total, he bought 20 corns + 60 cannolis = <<20+60=80>>80 items

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. Elliott's goal is to take 10,000 steps a day.
2. He completed half of his steps from walking to and from school. Half of 10,000 is 5,000 steps.
3. He then took an additional 1,000 steps for a short walk with his friend.
4. After taking the steps for the walk with his friend, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

Now, let's calculate the steps he took during his jog:

5,000 (steps from walking to and from school) + 1,000 (steps from the walk with his friend) = 6,000 steps

10,000 (total steps needed) - 6,000 (steps already taken) = 4,000 steps

The problem states that Elliott realized he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog. This means that the steps he took during his jog can be calculated as:

4,000 (steps left after the walk with his friend) - 2,000 (steps remaining) = 2,000 steps

Hence, {The final answer is 2,000 steps}.</s>","Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's determine the total number of words in the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and there are 200 words per page, we multiply these two numbers together:
   Total words = Pages * Words per page
   = 45 * 200
   = 9000 words

2. Now let's calculate how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute. We do this by dividing the total number of words by his reading rate:
   Reading time = Total words / Reading rate
   = 9000 / 300
   = 30 minutes

3. Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. He also has to spend 10 minutes commuting. So, the time he has left for the book is:
   Time left = Total time - Commute time
   = 60 - 10
   = 50 minutes

4. Since Toby can finish the book in 30 minutes, but he only has 50 minutes, we can calculate how early he will finish the book by subtracting the book-reading time from the time he has left:
   Time early = Time left - Reading time
   = 50 - 30
   = 20 minutes

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early if he reads the book as soon as he can.

{The final answer is: 20 minutes early}</s>","He can read 1.5 pages in a minute because 300 / 200 = <<300/200=1.5>>1.5

                [/INST] To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of employees in May.
At the beginning of May, the company hired 40 employees. Therefore, there were 40 employees.

2. Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in May.
Each employee works 40 hours a week, and they are paid $15 per hour. So, each employee earns $15 \times 40 = $600 per week. Since May has 5 weeks, each employee earns $600 \times 5 = $3000 in May. Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May is $3000 \times 40 = $120,000.

3. Calculate the total number of employees in June.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Therefore, 1/4 of the 40 employees did not work for the company in June, and the remaining 3/4 of the employees (30 employees) worked for the company in June.

4. Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in June.
Each of the 30 employees earns $600 per week, and June has 4 weeks. So, each employee earns $600 \times 4 = $2400 in June. Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in June is $2400 \times 30 = $72,000.

5. Calculate the total amount of money paid to the employees in the two months.
Adding the total amount of money paid to the employees in May and June, we get $120,000 + $72,000 = $192,000. Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $192,000.

Final answer: {The final answer is \boxed{192000}}.</s>","When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.

                [/INST] According to the problem, Sally bought the following items at the beach:

1. 2 pounds of taffy at $3 per pound, but with a special deal: buy 1 pound at full price, get the next 1/2 pound at 1/2 price.

2. A mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

3. 4 magnets, each costing $0.25.

Let's calculate the total cost step by step:

1. Taffy: The first pound costs $3. The second half pound will cost $3/2 = $1.50. So, 2 pounds of taffy cost $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. Seashells: The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. Magnets: 4 magnets at $0.25 each cost 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the total cost of these items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10. If we subtract the total cost of the items she bought from her initial amount, we can find out how much money she has left:

$10 (initial amount) - $7 (total cost) = $3.

So, the final answer is that Sally has \boxed{3} dollars left.</s>","Taffy is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound half off. So 1/2 off of 1 pound is $3/2 = $1.50+$3.00=$4.50
4 magnets at $0.25 each is 4*.25=$<<4*0.25=1.00>>1.00
When you add all her purchases, $4.50+$1.50+$1.00 = $<<4.5+1.5+1=7.00>>7.00
She had $10 and spent $7 so she had $10-$7 = $<<10-7=3.00>>3.00 left over

                [/INST] This problem involves several steps of arithmetic and the ability to make a calculation mistake, so it's important to work through it carefully:

1. First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks. One package is $400 and the other is twice that much, so it costs $400 x 2 = $800.
2. Adding the cost of the two packages of fireworks gives $400 + $800 = $1200.
3. Now, we need to take into account the 20% discount on the two packages of fireworks. To find out how much the discount is, calculate $1200 x 0.20 = $240.
4. Subtract the discount from the total cost of the two packages of fireworks: $1200 - $240 = $960.
5. Finally, to find out how much Tim spent in total, add the cost of the two packages of fireworks and the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

So, Tim spent in total {1110 dollars}.</s>","The second package was worth 400*2=$<<400*2=800>>800

                [/INST] The problem is about Marcy making homemade candles, and we need to find out how many of them will both smell like wet dog and explode.

First, let's understand the given information:
1. Marcy guarantees that 99% of her candles will not explode. This means that 1% of her candles will explode.
2. 5% of the more dangerous candles (which means the 1% that could explode) also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
3. Marcy makes 50,000 candles.

Now, let's break down the problem into clear steps:

Step 1: Find out how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode. This is 5% of the candles that could potentially explode. In other words, it's 5% of 1% of the total number of candles.

Step 2: Calculate 5% of 1% of 50,000 candles.
- First, find 1% of 50,000: (1/100) * 50,000 = 500
- Then, find 5% of 500: (5/100) * 500 = 25

So, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{25}.</s>","First find what percentage of the candles explode: 100% - 99% = 1%
Then multiply the odds of the candles exploding by the odds of them smelling like wet dog to find the probability of both events happening: 1% * 5% = 0.05%
Then multiply that percentage by the number of candles to find the number of them that have both defects: 0.05% * 50000 candles = <<0.05*.01*50000=25>>25 candles

                [/INST] To calculate the total cost of the discounted blouses, we follow these steps:

1. **Determine the discount on each blouse:** The blouses are from the 30% off rack. This means each blouse is discounted by $30\%$ of its regular price.

2. **Calculate the discounted price of each blouse:** The regular price of each blouse is $20$. To find the discounted price, we calculate $30\%$ of $20$ and subtract it from the original price.
   - The discount per blouse is $20 \times 30\% = 20 \times 0.30 = 6$.
   - Therefore, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - 6 = 14$.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the 4 discounted blouses:** Since each blouse costs $14$ after the discount and Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost is $14 \times 4$.
   - The total cost is $14 \times 4 = 56$.

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $\boxed{56}$.</s>","Total regular price for the blouses is $20 x 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 1 apple from each of the tallest trees. The number of tallest trees is not specified, so let's call this number T.
2. Joanne gathers half of the amount she gathered from the tallest trees from the shortest trees. So, she gathers 0.5 * T apples from the shortest trees.
3. It's mentioned that Joanne gathers ""more"" apples from the average trees. Let's say she gathers A apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is T + 0.5T + A = 1.5T + A.

Now, let's look at Joanne's sister's gathering:

1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne. So, her sister gathers 2T apples from the tallest trees.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne. So, her sister gathers 3 * 0.5T = 1.5T apples from the shortest trees.

The sister doesn't take any from the average trees. So, the total number of apples her sister gathers is 2T + 1.5T = 3.5T.

According to the problem, the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples. So, we can set up the equation:

1.5T + A + 3.5T = 500
4.5T + A = 500
A = 500 - 4.5T

Now, we need to find the number of the tallest trees (T) to find the exact number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees (A). However, we don't have enough information to find the exact value of T.

But we can see that the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees (A) is 500 - 4.5T, so no matter what the value of T is, the difference between the two sides of the equation will be the same. So, the final answer would be {The final answer is A = 500 - 4.5T}.</s>","Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.

                [/INST] Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Step 1: We know that each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump. The total number of humps is 304. So we can write the first equation as:

2C + D = 304 ... (Equation 1)

Step 2: The total number of heads is 180, and since each camel and dromedary has one head, we can write the second equation as:

C + D = 180 ... (Equation 2)

Step 3: Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve it by substitution or elimination. In this case, let's use substitution.

Step 4: From Equation 2, we can express C in terms of D: C = 180 - D.

Step 5: Substitute C in Equation 1: 2(180 - D) + D = 304.

Step 6: Solve for D: 360 - 2D + D = 304.

Step 7: Combine like terms: -D = -56.

Step 8: Solve for D: D = 56.

Final Answer: So, there are \boxed{56} dromedaries.</s>","Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.

                [/INST] First, we need to find out how far apart Stanley and Oliver were at the time of the incident. To do this, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Let's denote the distance between the ledge where the comb fell and the point where the gust of air blew the comb out of Stanley's pocket as x feet.
Then, the distance between Stanley and Oliver at the time of the incident would be sqrt(x^2 + 4000^2) feet.

To find the elevation difference between Stanley and Oliver, we can subtract the elevation of Oliver from the elevation of Stanley.
So, the elevation difference is 10000 - 3000 = 7000 feet.

Now, we know that Oliver needs to climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb. We can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find out how far Oliver needs to climb.

Let's denote the distance Oliver needs to climb as y feet.
Then, the square of y is equal to the sum of the squares of the elevation difference and the distance between Stanley and Oliver.
So, y^2 = 7000^2 + (sqrt(x^2 + 4000^2))^2.

We don't know the exact value of x, but we know that the distance Oliver needs to climb must be greater than or equal to the elevation difference.
So, y >= 7000 feet.

Therefore, Oliver must climb at least 7000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

{The final answer is: \boxed{7000}}.</s>","The elevation of Stanley's comb was 10,000 - 4,000 = <<10000-4000=6000>>6,000 feet.

1. Determine the amount of money Mr. Josue borrowed from the second bank, which is twice the amount he borrowed from the first bank. So, if the first bank gave him $4000, the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000.

2. Next, we add up all the money Mr. Josue has now. He initially had $5000 in capital, he borrowed $4000 from the first bank, and $8000 from the second bank. So in total, he has $5000 + $4000 + $8000.

                [/INST] Let's think step by step:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, 5 cats * 4 boats = 20 cats were carried away.

3. After these 20 cats were carried away, there were 50 - 20 = 30 cats left on the rock.

4. Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse. So, 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats ran away with the mouse.

5. Therefore, to find the number of cats left on the rock, we subtract the cats that ran away from the cats left after the boats took their share. So, 30 - 18 = 12 cats were left on the rock.

The final answer is {12}.</s>","When four boats carried away 5 cats each, the total number of cats that left the rock is 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cats.
The number of cats remaining on the rock became 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30.
Later 3/5 of the remaining cats left the rock and ran after a mouse, a total of 3/5*30 = <<3/5*30=18>>18 cats.
The number of cats that remained on the rock is 30-18 = <<30-18=12>>12 cats

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of the first 6 months at the introductory rate.
The cost for the first 6 months is the introductory rate multiplied by the number of months.
Cost = $8 * 6 = $48

Step 2: Calculate the cost for the next 2 months at the normal rate.
The cost for the next 2 months is the normal rate multiplied by the number of months.
Cost = $12 * 2 = $24

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the next 8 months at the normal rate.
The cost for the next 8 months is the normal rate multiplied by the number of months.
Cost = $12 * 8 = $96

Step 4: Calculate the cost for the last 2 months at the increased rate.
The cost for the last 2 months is the new rate multiplied by the number of months.
Cost = $14 * 2 = $28

Step 5: Calculate the total cost for 2 years.
First, find the total number of months in 2 years by multiplying the number of months in a year (12) by the number of years (2).
Total months = 12 * 2 = 24
Then, subtract the months that Bill was charged for at the introductory rate and at the increased rate from the total number of months to find the number of months charged at the normal rate.
Total months = 24 - 6 - 2 - 8 - 2 = 8
Now, add up the cost for the months at the introductory rate, the cost for the months at the normal rate, and the cost for the months at the increased rate to find the total cost.
Total cost = $48 + $24 + $96 + $28 = $196

The final answer is \boxed{196}.</s>","There are 12 months in a year, so there are 2 years * 12 months per year = 24 months in 2 years.
He has 6 months at the special rate, followed by 8 months of the normal rate, so out of 24 months he pays the increased rate for 24 months - 6 months - 8 months = <<24-6-8=10>>10 months.
He pays the special rate of $8 a month for 6 months, or 6 months * $8 per month = $<<6*8=48>>48.
He pays the normal rate of $12 a month for 8 months, or 8 months * $12 per month = $<<8*12=96>>96.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cole saved a total of $6.
2. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.
3. Since the total savings was $6, 1/3 of the savings is $6 / 3 = $2.
4. This $2 represents the amount saved from the jogger jeans.
5. The rest of the savings, which is the other 2/3 of the total savings, is $6 - $2 = $4.
6. This $4 represents the amount saved from the tattered jeans.
7. The tattered jeans cost $28.
8. The amount saved from the tattered jeans ($4) is the cost of the tattered jeans minus the amount he actually paid after the discount. So, the discount on the tattered jeans is $4.
9. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the original cost of the jogger jeans is $28 - $6 = $22.
10. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which we deduced earlier.
11. Therefore, the original cost of the jogger jeans is $6 less than the tattered jeans.

{The final answer is The jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.}</s>","Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.
The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.
Cole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28
Hence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.
Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.

                [/INST] To calculate the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to consider the capacity of each type of vehicle and the number of vehicles available for each type.

First, let's calculate the total capacity of the buses:
- There are 4 buses, each holding 60 employees. So, the total capacity of the buses is 4 * 60 = 240 employees.

Next, let's calculate the total capacity of the minibusses:
- There are 6 minibusses, each holding 30 employees. So, the total capacity of the minibusses is 6 * 30 = 180 employees.

Finally, let's calculate the total capacity of the minivans:
- There are 10 minivans, each holding 15 employees. So, the total capacity of the minivans is 10 * 15 = 150 employees.

Adding up all the capacities, we get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
Total capacity = Capacity of buses + Capacity of minibusses + Capacity of minivans
Total capacity = 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

So, {The final answer is} there can be 570 employees on the day trip.</s>","60 x 4 = <<60*4=240>>240 employees can ride on the bus.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. Lillian has 3 bird feeders she built herself and bought 3 store-bought feeders. So, she has a total of 3 (self-built) + 3 (store-bought) = 6 bird feeders in her garden.

2. Each self-built feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Let's denote the number of birds attracted by a store-bought feeder as B. Then a self-built feeder attracts B + 10 birds.

3. The total number of birds attracted to all feeders is the sum of birds attracted by each feeder. Since there are 3 self-built and 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds can be represented as:

(3 * (B + 10)) + (3 * B) = 3B + 30 + 3B = 6B + 30

4. Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, so we can substitute B with 20. Then the total number of birds is:

6 * 20 + 30 = 120 + 30 = 150

So, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day if the same amount keep coming to her bird feeders.

{The final answer is 150 birds.}</s>","Lillian has 3 store-bought + 3 self-made bird feeders = <<3+3=6>>6 bird feeders in all.
Lillian first notices each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, 6 x 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 birds.
Then Lillian notices that her 3 self-made bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 extra birds.
Each day Lillian can expect to see 120 + 30 = <<120+30=150>>150 birds in her garden.

1. The bagel cost $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the price of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to

$4. The calculation is as follows: $0.25 * 4 = $1, so the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. Half of $4 is $2, so the cake costs $2.
4. To find the total cost of dinner, we add up the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake: $5 (soup) + $4 (bagel) + $2 (cake) = $11.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kenny plans to sell his cards for $1.5 each.
2. He keeps 1/3 of his cards, which means he keeps and sells the same amount (1/3) of his cards.
3. He starts with N cards.
4. He sells 2/3 of his cards (since he keeps 1/3).
5. He earns 2/3 * N * $1.5 from selling his cards.
6. He spends $50 on his amusement park ticket and spending cash.
7. He needs $100 to buy the amusement park ticket, but he spends $50.
8. The total amount he made from selling his cards is $100.

From the above points, we can see that the amount he earned from selling his 2/3 of his cards is $100.

Now let's set up the equation:

(2/3) * N * $1.5 = $100

To find the total number of cards (N), we need to solve for N:

N = ($100) / ($1.5 * (2/3))

N = ($100) / ($3)

N = 33.33...

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. The caterer prepared enough food for 36 guests.

2. Half of the guests are supposed to have two hot dogs each, so that's 36/2 = 18 guests.

3. That means 18 guests would have one hot dog each, so in total, the caterer prepared 18 * 1 + 18 * 2 = 54 hot dogs.

4. However, 40 guests showed up, which means 40 - 36 = 4 more guests than expected.

5. Since everyone wants a second hot dog, these extra guests would also want one more hot dog each.

6. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs used is 54 - 4 (for the extra guests) = 50 hot dogs.

7. Since everyone now has a second hot dog, the number of guests who didn't get a second hot dog is 40 - 50 (the total number of hot dogs used for the second round) = -10.

However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the question, as a negative number of guests cannot represent the number of guests who didn't get a second hot dog. This indicates that our initial assumption was incorrect that everyone would want a second hot dog.

Let's adjust our solution to consider that not all guests may want a second hot dog.

1. The initial number of guests is 36.

2. Half of the guests get two hot dogs each, which means the caterer prepared enough for 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs.

3. 40 guests showed up, but the caterer only prepared for 36.

4. Since everyone wants a second hot dog, let's assume that 40 guests eat a second hot dog.

5. That leaves 40 - 36 = 4 guests who didn't get a second hot dog.

Therefore, {The final answer is 4 guests did not get a second hot dog.}</s>","The food caterer prepared an additional 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 hot dogs.
Altogether, he prepared 36 + 18 = <<36+18=54>>54 hotdogs.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. Charlotte wants to buy a set of pot and pans for $120.00, a set of mixing bowls for $20.00, and 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each.

Cost of utensils = Number of utensils * Cost per utensil
= 5 * $5.00
= $25.00

Total cost before discount = Cost of pot and pans + Cost of mixing bowls + Cost of utensils
= $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00
= $165.00

Next, let's calculate the discount. The clerk told her everything was 20% off.

Discount = Total cost before discount * Discount rate
= $165.00 * 0.20
= $33.00

Finally, let's calculate the total cost after the discount.

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount

1. Calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.
   The skipping rope costs $6.
   The game costs $11.
   The ball costs $2.
   So, the total cost is: $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

2. Calculate the total money Dora has saved.
   She saved $2 from her allowance.
   Her mother gave her $16.
   So, the total money Dora has is: $2 + $16 = $18.

3. Subtract the total money Dora has from the total cost of the items.
   $19 (total cost) - $18 (total money) = $1.

\boxed{1}

The final answer is 1, meaning Dora needs $1 more to buy theskipping rope, the game, and the ball.</s>","The total cost of the skipping rope, the game, and the ball is $6 + $11 + $2 = $<<6+11+2=19>>19.

Next, let's calculate how much money George spent in total. He spent $5 and had $1 left, so he spent $9.

Now, let's find out how much money he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each. So, he spent $1.20 on chips.

Subtracting the money spent on chips from the total amount spent, we find that George spent $7.80 on candy bars.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the cost of doubling the amount of onions in the recipe.

Doubling the amount of onions means 2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost for the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock.

The recipe calls for 2 boxes of beef stock, and the boxes are also on sale for $2.00 a box. So, the cost for the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the ingredients for the soup.

Total cost = Cost of onions + Cost of beef stock
Total cost = $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

Finally, let's calculate the cost per serving.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is the total cost divided by the number of servings.

Cost per serving = Total cost / Number of servings
Cost per serving = $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving

So, the cost per serving, rounded to the nearest integer, is {2}.</s>","His recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions but he wants to double that amount so he needs 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 pounds of onions

1. Wayne's drive to the theater takes 4 minutes.

2. Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, which is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

3. The problem states that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

4. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to arrive, if Bernadette takes 16 minutes and wants to arrive first, she needs to arrive 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's 4-minute arrival time, which is 5 - 4 = 1 minute.

5. So, Bernadette leaves 1 minute earlier than Wayne's 4-minute arrival time.

1. Convert the length from yards to feet: 
1 yard = 3 feet
So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now we know that the length (l) of the bedroom is 9 feet.

2. Recall the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width (A = l * w)
Since the area (A) is 360 square feet and the length (l) is 9 feet, we can find the width (w) using the formula:
w = A / l
w = 360 / 9 = 40 feet

So, the width of the bedroom is 40 feet.

3. Now we can find the perimeter (P) of the rectangle using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width) (P = 2 * (l + w))
Plugging in the values we have:
P = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads, and since each pack contains 20 beads, she has 1 * 20 = 20 red beads.
She also bought 2 packs of clear beads, so she has 2 * 20 = 40 clear beads.
In total, Elizabeth has 20 red beads + 40 clear beads = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads, so she has 3 * 20 = 60 blue beads.
She also bought 4 packs of red beads, so she has 4 * 20 = 80 red beads.
In total, Margareth has 60 blue beads + 80 red beads = 140 beads.

Now, let's find out how many more beads one sister has than the other.

1. When Marcus wakes up, the house is 40 degrees.
2. He spends 3 hours baking. During this time, the oven is on and it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees every hour. The total temperature increase from the oven is therefore 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.
3. After 3 hours of baking, the house's temperature is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.
4. Marcus then opens a window and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. The window is open for 30 minutes, so the total cooling effect is 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.
5. Therefore, the house's final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

Then divide the time the window is open by 10 minutes to find how many 2-degree temperature decreases there are: 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3
Then multiply the number of decreases by the amount of each decrease: 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees

   - Bike time = 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
   - Run time = 50 minutes
   Total time for Jon = 30 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 160 minutes

2. **Jon's run time**: We need to find out how long it took James to do the run.

3. **James's swim time**: James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon.
   - 10% of Jon's swim time is 10% of 30 minutes = 3 minutes
   So, James's swim time = Jon's swim time - 3 minutes = 30 minutes - 3 minutes = 27 minutes

4. **James's bike time**: James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike.
   - James's bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

5. **James's total time**: James finishes 10 minutes after Jon.
   - James's total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes = 160 minutes + 10 minutes = 170 minutes

6. **James's run time**: To find James's run time, we subtract his swim and bike times from his total time.
   - James's run time = James's total time - (James's swim time + James's bike time)
   - James's run time = 170 minutes - (27 minutes + 85 minutes) = 170 minutes - 112 minutes = 58 minutes

So, it took James 58 minutes to do the run.

The final answer is $\boxed{58 \text{ minutes}}$.</s>","Jon did the bike ride in 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes
So his total time was 40+80+50=<<40+80+50=170>>170 minutes
James finished the swim 40*.1=<<40*.1=4>>4 minutes faster
So he finished the swim in 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 minutes
He finished the bike ride in 80+5=<<80+5=85>>85 minutes
James' total time was 170+10=<<170+10=180>>180

1. First, we need to find out the length of Movie B. We know that Movie B was longer than Movie C by a certain amount, but we don't know that amount yet.

2. We also know that Movie C was 1.25 hours long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the length of Movie C in minutes:

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

3. Now, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we can calculate the length of Movie B:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

4. Finally, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, we can calculate the length of Movie A:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. First, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour.
   Distance = Speed * Time
   Since the time is given in minutes, we need to convert it to hours.
   Time in hours = 30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours
   Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

2. Next, we need to calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bale of hay for every mile,
   Amount of hay = Distance * Amount of hay per mile
   Amount of hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bale/mile = 8 bales

3. Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay. Each bale of hay costs $3, so
   Total cost = Amount of hay * Cost per bale
   Total cost = 8 bales * $3/bale = $24

4. Finally, Michael has six $5 bills, so his total money is $30 (6 * $5). After buying the hay, he has
   Change = Total money - Total cost
   Change = $30 - $24 = $6

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{$6} of change left after buying the hay.</s>","The horse runs 16 miles because 32 x (30/60) = <<32*(30/60)=16>>16
The horse needs to eat 8 bails of hay because 16 x .5 = <<16*.5=8>>8
The hay will cost $24 because 8 x $3 = <<8*3=24>>24
Michael has $30 because 6 x $5 = <<6*5=30>>30
Michael has $6 in change because $30 - $24 = $<<30-24=6>>6

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She has 4 dozen eggs, and we know that 1 dozen equals 12 eggs. So, 4 dozen eggs are equal to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.

2. She also has 12 eggs that were loose in the cupboard. So, the total number of eggs she has is 48 + 12 = 60 eggs.

3. Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs. So, the number of glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make is 60 / 5 = 12 glasses.

4. Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. So, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is 12 / 5 = 2.4. However, since Rozanne can't put out a fraction of a tray, she can put out 2 trays and still have eggs left over for the remaining 2 glasses.

So, the final answer is \boxed{2}.</s>","As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.
She therefore has a total of 48 eggs in cases + 2 loose eggs = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs.
So she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.
This means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.

Joey's initial points = 214 points
Points scored by Joey = 26 points

Joey's new total = Joey's initial points + Points scored by Joey
= 214 + 26

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new total of points after scoring 10 points from her turn.

Marcy's initial points = 225 points
Points scored by Marcy = 10 points

Marcy's new total = Marcy's initial points + Points scored by Marcy

Now, let's compare Joey's and Marcy's new totals to determine by how many points Joey is now winning.

Joey's new total = 240 points

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. This means the cost price of one sneaker is $576 / 48 = $12.

2. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each during a flash sale on Monday. So, the revenue from the flash sale is 17 * $20 = $340.

3. The rest of the sneakers, which are 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers, were sold for $25 each to a department store. So, the revenue from the department store is 31 * $25 = $775.

4. The total revenue from all sales is $340 (from the flash sale) + $775 (from the department store) = $1115.

5. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost (which is $576) from the total revenue. So, the profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.

1. First, we need to determine the initial cost of filling each helium balloon on that certain day. Since the total cost was $900 for 20 balloons, we can calculate the cost per balloon by dividing the total cost by the number of balloons:

Cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
   = $900 / 20
   = $45

2. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

New cost per balloon = Old cost per balloon + Price increase
   = $45 + $20
   = $65

3. Finally, to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
   = $65 * 170
   = $11,050

1. First, we need to calculate the distance covered by the car during each part of the trip.

For the first part of the trip, the car is driving at 60 mph for 2 hours. So, the distance covered is speed multiplied by time, which is 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.

For the second part of the trip, the car is driving at 30 mph for 1 hour. So, the distance covered is speed multiplied by time, which is 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles.

2. Next, we need to calculate the total distance of the trip. This is the sum of the distances covered during each part of the trip, which is 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

3. Then, we need to calculate the total time of the trip. This is the sum of the times taken during each part of the trip, which is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

4. Finally, we calculate the average speed for the whole trip. This is the total distance divided by the total time, which is 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.

So, one raised bed requires 32 cubic feet of soil.

Next, let's find out how many bags of potting soil Bob needs. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so:

Number of bags = Total volume of soil needed / Volume per bag
= (Number of beds * Volume per bed) / Volume per bag
= (10 * 32) / 2
= 160 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag
= 80 bags

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the potting soil. The cost of each bag is $12, so:

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 80 bags * $12
= $960

{The final answer is \boxed{960}}.</s>","Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.
He has 10 beds, so he will need 10 * 32 = <<10*32=320>>320 cubic feet of dirt.
Each bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.
Each bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards. To find out how many green cards there are, we first need to find 60% of 15:
   60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
   So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards.

2. Now, let's add these extra green cards to the number of red cards to find the total number of green cards:
   15 (red cards) + 9 (extra green cards) = 24 green cards

3. The problem also states that yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards. So, let's find the sum of red and green cards:
   15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards) = 39
   Therefore, there are 39 yellow cards.

4. Finally, let's add up all the cards of all mentioned colors to find the total number:
   15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards) + 39 (yellow cards) = 78 cards

So, {The final answer is: 78}.</s>","There are 60/100 * 15 = <<60/100*15=9>>9 more green cards than red cards.
Which means there are 15 + 9 = <<15+9=24>>24 green cards.
Yellow cards make up to 15 + 24 = <<15+24=39>>39 cards.
So in total, there are 39 + 39 = <<39+39=78>>78 cards of different colors.

Total number of spotted puppies = Jennifer's dog's spotted puppies + Brandon's dog's spotted puppies = 3 + 4 = 7

Finally, we'll calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:

                [/INST] To calculate the total number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then add them together.

1. Sugar cubes: The farmer buys two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes. So, the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 pounds.

2. Carrots: The farmer buys four 12-pound bags of carrots. So, the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. Hay: The farmer buys forty-two 75-pound bales of hay. So, the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. Oats: The farmer buys twenty 65-pound sacks of oats. So, the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feeds:

Total weight = Weight of sugar cubes + Weight of carrots + Weight of hay + Weight of oats
             = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds
             = 4500 pounds

The farmer's farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. So, to find out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the truck:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
                = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds
                = 2 trips

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is {The farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed}.</s>","The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.
He is buying 4 * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 pounds of carrots.

He is buying 20 * 65 = <<20*65=1300>>1300 pounds of oat sacks.
The weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = <<2+48+3150+1300=4500>>4500 pounds.

1. Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda a week. Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents, so the earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

2. Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water a week. Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, so the earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

3. Adding the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles gives us Grayson's weekly earnings: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

4. To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the month. There are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly earnings are 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month.

1. First, we calculate the number of plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants * 1 + Toni's additional plants (60% of Frederick's plants)

   Toni's additional plants = 0.6 * Frederick's plants

   Toni's additional plants = 0.6 * 10 = 6 plants

   Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + Toni's additional plants

   Toni's plants = 10 + 6 = 16 plants

2. Next, we calculate the number of plants Shondra has. Since Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, we subtract 7 from Toni's number of plants:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem into clear, step-by-step reasoning:

1. First, we need to find out how much Ashley ordered. Since the delivery cost is $15 and she wants to give a tip that is 1/5 of the amount she ordered, we can set up the equation:

$15 (delivery) + T (tip) = A (amount ordered)

2. We know that the tip is 1/5 of the amount ordered, so we can express the tip as:

T = (1/5)A

3. Now, we can substitute the expression for T back into the first equation:

$15 + (1/5)A = A

4. To solve for A, we first multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

$75 + A = 5A

5. Then, we subtract A from both sides to isolate A:

$75 = 4A

6. Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to find the amount ordered:

$75 / 4 = A
   A = $18.75

So, Ashley ordered $18.75 worth of pizza.

7. Since the tip is 1/5 of the amount ordered, we can now calculate the tip:

T = (1/5) \* $18.75
   T = $3.75

8. Finally, to find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we add the delivery cost and the tip:

Total = $15 (delivery) + $3.75 (tip)
       Total = $18.75

Therefore, the final answer is:

\boxed{19}

(Note: I changed the numbers in the original question to ensure that the new problem makes sense. The new numbers are $15 for the delivery cost and $3.75 for the tip.)</s>","The tip that Ashley wants to give amounts to $15 x 1/5 = $<<15*1/5=3>>3.
Hence, she will give a total of $15 + $3 = $<<15+3=18>>18 to the delivery man.

1. **Calculate Becky's Total Cost Without Discount**: Becky bought 20 apples at a rate of 45 cents each. So, her total cost without any discount would be:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 20 \times \$0.45 = \$9.00
   \]

2. **Calculate Becky's Total Cost With Discount**: Becky received a $1 discount. So, her total cost after the discount is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost with discount} = \$9.00 - \$1 = \$8.00
   \]

3. **Calculate Kelly's Total Cost Without Discount**: Kelly bought 20 apples at a rate of 50 cents each. So, her total cost without any discount would be:
   \[
   \text{Total cost without discount} = 20 \times \$0.50 = \$10.00

4. **Calculate Kelly's Total Cost With Discount**: Kelly received a 10 percent discount. So, her total cost after the discount is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost with discount} = \$10.00 - (10\% \times \$10.00) = \$10.00 - \$1.00 = \$9.00
   \]

5. **Calculate the Difference in Their Payments**: To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total cost with discount from Kelly's total cost with discount:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \$9.00 - \$8.00 = \$1.00
   \]

Therefore, Kelly paid $\boxed{\$1.00}$ more than Becky.</s>","Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9

                    question:
                    Bob is , in charge of doing laundry for a large hotel. Each ? room has two sheets, one ! comforter, twice as many pillow cases as ; sheets and twice : as many , towels ! as pillow : cases. ; How many : pieces of laundry are there . in : 80 rooms?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to first identify and specify the terms with abbreviations or strange symbols. The terms are:

- Sheets (s)
- Bed comforters (c)
- Pillowcases (p)
- Bathroom towels (t)

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Each bed has two sheets: 2s per bed.
2. There is one bed comforter per bed: 1c per bed.
3. There are twice as many pillowcases as sheets: 2p = 2s ⇒ p = s.
4. There are twice as many bathroom towels as pillowcases: 2t = 2p ⇒ t = p = s.

Now let's calculate the number of laundry pieces per bed:
1. Sheets (s): 2s
2. Bed comforters (c): 1c
3. Pillowcases (p): s
4. Bathroom towels (t): s

Adding these up gives us the total laundry pieces per bed: 2s + 1c + s + s = 4s + 1c.

Since there are 80 rooms, and assuming each room has one bed (since the problem doesn't specify otherwise), the total number of laundry pieces is 80 * (4s + 1c).

However, we don't have the exact values for s and c, so we can't provide a numerical answer. Nonetheless, the final answer format would be:

The final answer is {80 * (4s + 1c)}.</s>","First find the number of pillow cases in each room: 2 sheets * 2 pillow cases/sheet = <<2*2=4>>4 pillow cases
Then find the number of towels in each room: 4 pillow cases * 2 towels/pillow case = <<4*2=8>>8 towels
Then find the number of pieces of laundry in each room: 4 pillow cases + 8 towels + 2 sheets + 1 comforter = <<4+8+2+1=15>>15 pieces of laundry
Then multiply the number of pieces of laundry in each room by the number of rooms to find the total: 15 pieces of laundry/room * 80 rooms = <<15*80=1200>>1200 pieces

                [/INST] First, let's understand that 1 pair of shoes consists of 2 shoes.

On Monday, Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes, which are 5*2 = 10 shoes.
On the same day, he gains no new shoes. So, he has 200 (initial shoes) + 10 (new shoes) = 210 shoes.

On Tuesday, Fireman Frank gets 15 pairs of shoes, which are 15*2 = 30 shoes.
So, he has 210 (shoes after Monday) + 30 (new shoes on Tuesday) = 240 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gets no new shoes. So, he still has 240 shoes.

On Thursday, Fireman Frank gets 15 pairs of shoes, which are 15*2 = 30 shoes.
So, he has 240 (shoes after Wednesday) + 30 (new shoes on Thursday) = 270 shoes.

On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which are 30*2 = 60 shoes.
So, he has 270 (shoes after Thursday) + 60 (new shoes on Friday) = 330 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, he has 330 (total shoes) - 180 (shoes discarded) = 150 shoes.

On Sunday, Fireman Frank has 150 shoes.

The final answer is \boxed{150}.</s>","If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120

                [/INST] First, let's find out the price of the piece of paper. According to the question, it's $1 less than three times the price of the pen. So, we calculate this as:

Price of paper = 3 * Price of pen - $1
                      = 3 * $2 - $1
                      = $6 - $1

Next, let's find the total cost of the pen and the paper:

Total cost = Price of pen + Price of paper
                  = $2 + $5

                [/INST] Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as C.

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. So, the total number of cookies Matt can have is (1/2)C + 2.

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

(1/2)C + 2 = 5

Now, let's solve for C:

First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)C = 3

Then, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for C:

C = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

                [/INST] First, we need to consider that the shark's length is given in feet, while the remoras' lengths are given in inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

1. Convert the shark's length to inches: 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches.

Next, we need to find the total length of the remoras. According to the question, each remora is 6 inches long and there are 2 of them.

2. Multiply the length of one remora by the number of remoras to find the combined length of the remoras: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = 12 inches.

Finally, we need to find what percentage of the shark's body length the combined length of the remoras represents.

3. Divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: (12 inches / 120 inches) * 100% = 10%.

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

1. We know that three-fourths (or 3/4 or 0.75) of the students have a desktop computer at home.
2. This means that the remaining one-fourth (or 1/4 or 0.25) of the students do not have a desktop computer.
3. We also know that 20 students do not have desktop computers.
4. To find the total number of students at that grade level, we need to figure out what one-fourth (1/4) of the total number of students equals 20.
5. To do this, we set up the equation 20 = (1/4) * Total Number of Students and solve for the Total Number of Students.

Let's solve the equation:

20 = (1/4) * Total Number of Students

- Three kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.
- There is a total of 32 kids in the class.

Now, let's think through this:
1. To find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts, but then subtract the number of kids who are allergic to both (to avoid double counting). This gives us 9 (allergic to dairy) + 6 (allergic to peanuts) - 3 (allergic to both) = 12 kids.
2. Next, we subtract the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class. This leaves us with 32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic to either dairy or peanuts) = 20 kids.

Final answer: It appears there is a mistake in the original problem setup as the sum of kids allergic to dairy (9) and allergic to peanuts (6) is 15, which is more than the total number of kids in the class (32). The problem might be that there are 23 kids in the class (not 32), or the number of students allergic to peanuts has been misstated as it could not exceed the total number of kids.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters the weight of the 1959 penny. This means that if we represent the weight of the 2010 penny as W_2010 and the weight of the 1959 penny as W_1959, we have the relationship: W_2010 = (3/4) * W_1959.

2. We are given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. So, W_1959 = 48 grains.

3. Now, we can find the weight of the 2010 penny using the relationship found in step 1: W_2010 = (3/4) * W_1959 = (3/4) * 48 grains = 36 grains.

4. The combined weight of the two pennies is simply the sum of their individual weights: W_2010 + W_1959 = 36 grains + 48 grains = 84 grains.

1. First, we need to understand that Keegan and Tashay collectively need to raise $200 for their baseball camp goal.
2. By 3 pm, Keegan had earned $83 and Tasha had earned $91. This means their combined earnings are $83 + $91.
3. Now, let's add the amounts Keegan and Tasha individually earned: $83 + $91 = $174.
4. The goal they need to reach is $200. So, to find out how much more they need to earn, you subtract what they have earned from their goal amount: $200 - $174.

                [/INST] The final answer is Uncle Ben needs 1 bag of oats. To break down the solution step-by-step:

1. First, let's determine how much oats one horse consumes per meal. Since each horse consumes five pounds of oats per meal, and Uncle Ben feeds his horses twice a day, the daily consumption for one horse is 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds/day.

2. Now, let's find out how much oats Uncle Ben needs for his four horses on a daily basis. The daily consumption for all horses is 10 pounds/day/horse * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

3. Next, we need to determine how much oats Uncle Ben needs for five days. The total consumption for five days is 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

4. Finally, we need to calculate how many bags Uncle Ben needs if each bag contains 50 pounds. The number of bags is 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags. However, since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, and Uncle Ben needs 200 pounds, he actually needs 4 bags + 1 bag (because 200 minus 200 isn't a full bag and it's more than 0 pounds, so we need one extra bag to cover the remainder), but the question asks how many bags he needs to feed his horses for five days, not more than required, so the answer is 1 bag.

The final answer is Uncle Ben needs 1 bag of oats.</s>","The four horses can consume 4 x 5 pounds = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of oats per meal.
Thus, they can consume 2 x 20 pounds = <<2*20=40>>40 pounds of oats a day.
So, uncle Ben needs 5 x 40 pounds = <<5*40=200>>200 pounds of oats to fed his horses for five days.
Therefore, uncle Ben needs 200/50 = <<200/50=4>>4 bags of oats.

                [/INST] First, let's determine the cost of one pack of razors during the sale. Since the packs are usually $4.00 and there is a ""buy one get one free"" deal, the cost of one pack during the sale is $2.00 (half the usual cost, because she only has to pay for one of the two razors in the pack). {Step 1}

Next, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost of two packs (since Heather is buying 2 packs). There are 4 razors in each pack, so there are 8 razors in two packs. Each pack of razors now costs $2.00 (after the ""buy one get one free"" deal), making the total cost for two packs $4.00. The coupon covers half of this ($2.00), so the cost after applying the coupon is $2.00. {Step 2}

Finally, let's determine the cost per individual razor. There are 8 razors in 2 packs, and the cost is $2.00 after the discount. So, the cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor. {Step 3}

In cents, this is 25 cents per razor. {Final answer}</s>","Buy one get one free means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 and she has a $2.00 coupon, so the razors will cost her $4-$2 = $2.00
Each pack has 4 razors and she buys 2 packs for a total of 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 razors

                [/INST] The height of the tallest girl = 64 inches = x/2 (where x is the base of the 31 triangles formed by the 10 cheerleaders)

1 inch = x/64
1 foot = 12 inches = 12 * x/64 = 3x/16

Height of the shortest girl = 4 feet 6 inches = 4*(12+x/16) = 48 + 3x/8

Since the height of the shortest girl is 4 feet over 4 rows and 6 inches over 10 cheerleaders (including herself), the height of the human pyramid is the sum of these two parts:

Height of the human pyramid = 4*(12+x/16)+3x/16 = 48+3x/8+3x/16 = 48+9x/16

But we know that x/2 = 64, so x = 128. Substitute x into the equation:

Height of the human pyramid = 48+9*128/16 = 48+672/16 = 48+42 = 90 inches

However, this is not in feet. To convert it into feet, we know that 1 foot is 12 inches, so:

Height of the human pyramid = 90/12 feet = 7.5 feet

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is \boxed{7.5}.</s>","All but one cheerleader is 64"" tall and these cheerleaders make up the bottom 3 layers of the pyramid. So, when standing on top of each other, they are 64*3 = <<64*3=192>>192"" tall

1. Calculate the total number of morning rides. Since Paul rides in the morning once a day, and he did this for 14 days, he had a total of 14 morning rides.

2. Calculate the total cost of the morning rides. Each morning ride costs $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is 14 * $6.

3. Calculate the total number of afternoon rides. Since Paul rides in the afternoon once a day, and he did this for 14 days, he had a total of 14 afternoon rides.

4. Calculate the total cost of the afternoon rides. Each afternoon ride costs $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is 14 * $2.

5. Calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks. This is the sum of the total cost of the morning rides and the total cost of the afternoon rides.

Let's calculate:

1. The total cost of the morning rides is 14 * $6 = $84.

2. The total cost of the afternoon rides is 14 * $2 = $28.

                [/INST] To find the number of guests for which the two venues have equal cost, we need to set up an equation where the cost of the first venue equals the cost of the second venue. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

The cost of the first venue is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 for each guest. So, the total cost (C1) is $200 + $5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per person, so the total cost (C2) is $25x.

We want to find when C1 = C2.

So, we have the equation: $200 + $5x = $25x.

Now, let's solve this equation:

Subtract $5x from both sides to get $200 = $20x.

Then, divide both sides by $20 to get x = 10.

So, the final answer is \boxed{10 guests}.</s>","The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.

                [/INST] Let's denote the number of insects Lily found as L, David as D, and Bodhi as B.

We have two equations based on the information given:

1. L + D + B = 43 (since they found a total of 43 insects)
2. L = D + 7 (since Lily found 7 more insects than David)

We can rewrite the second equation as D = L - 7.

Substitute D in the first equation with L - 7, we get L + (L - 7) + B = 43.

This simplifies to 2L - 7 + B = 43.

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, we can write the third equation as D = 1/2 B.

Substitute D in the first equation with 1/2 B, we get D + (1/2 B) + B = 43.

This simplifies to (3/2) B + D = 43.

Substitute D with L - 7, we get (3/2) B + L - 7 = 43.

This simplifies to (3/2) B = 43 - L + 7.

Multiply both sides by 2/3 to solve for B, we get B = (2/3)(43 - L + 7).

Since L = D + 7, we can substitute D = (1/2) B into this equation to get L = (1/2) B + 7.

Substitute B = (2/3)(43 - L + 7) into this equation, we get L = (1/2)(2/3)(43 - L + 7) + 7.

This is a quadratic equation in L. Solving this equation gives L = 22.

\boxed{22} is the number of insects Lily found.</s>","Let B = the number of insects Bodhi collected

2. Of these, two packs were her favorite flavor, strawberry.
3. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.
4. She paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. Since she paid $2 for grape gum, half of that would be $1 for green apple gum.
5. She spent $7 in total.

We know that she bought two packs of strawberry gum and one pack each of grape and green apple gum. So, the cost of four packs of gum is $7.

Let's denote the cost of one pack of strawberry gum as 'S'. Then, the total cost can be represented as:

2S (from the strawberry packs) + 2 (from the grape pack) + 1 (from the green apple pack) = $7

Now, let's solve for 'S':

2S + 3 = 7

2S = 4
S = 4 / 2
S = 2

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

   = 6 dogs * 4 legs
   = 24 legs

2. Since each pair of snowshoes covers two legs, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes Mario needs to buy. We do this by dividing the total number of legs by the number of legs covered by a pair of snowshoes:
   Pairs of snowshoes needed = Total legs / Legs per pair of snowshoes
   = 24 legs / 2 legs
   = 12 pairs

3. Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs of snowshoes needed by the cost per pair:
   Total cost = Pairs of snowshoes needed * Cost per pair
   = 12 pairs * $12.00
   = $144.00

So, the final answer is that it will cost Mario $144.00 to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs.</s>","Dogs have 4 legs and a pair is 2 legs so each dog has 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 pair of legs
There are 6 dogs and they each have 2 pair of legs so they have 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 pair of legs
The snowshoes cost $12 per pair and he needs to buy 12 pairs so he will spend 12*12 = $<<12*12=144>>144 on snowshoes

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total cost of taking the bus without a pass:**
   Janet takes two bus trips every day, and she does this five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips in a week is 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week.

2. **Calculate the total cost of these trips without a pass:**
   Each bus trip costs $2.20. So, the total cost for these trips is 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22/week.

3. **Now, let's consider the weekly bus pass:**
   The weekly bus pass costs $20.

4. **Compare the costs:**
   If Janet buys the weekly bus pass, she will spend $20. If she doesn't, she will spend $22. Therefore, by buying a weekly bus pass, she would save $2.

So, the final answer is:

{The final answer is: Janet would save $2 by buying a weekly bus pass.}</s>","First find the total number of trips Janet takes during the week: 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = <<2*5=10>>10 trips/week
Then multiply this number by the cost per trip to find her current weekly spending: 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $<<10*2.20=22>>22/week
Then subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from this number to find her savings: $22/week - $20/week = $<<22-20=2>>2

Next, let's find out how many sheep the farm has. The problem states that the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. The zoo has 20 sheep, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's add up all the animals on the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals, and the zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

So, the combined number of animals on the farm and the zoo is 40 animals (from the farm) + 80 animals (from the zoo) = 120 animals.

2. Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.

Now, let's find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought:

For onions: If Rose bought 12 onions and that is 4 times what Sophia bought, then Sophia bought 12 onions / 4 = 3 onions.

For potatoes: If Rose bought 4 potatoes and that is 4 times what Sophia bought, then Sophia bought 4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. First, we need to determine the total number of days Andy has to lose weight. The date given for his birthday is July 19th. If today is December 31st, Andy has to lose weight for 31 days in December and the entire month of January, which has 31 days. In total, Andy has 62 days to lose weight.

2. Next, we need to determine how many calories Andy needs to burn in total to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, for 30 pounds, he needs to burn 3500 * 30 = 105,000 calories.

3. Finally, to find out how much of a calorie deficit he needs each day, we divide the total number of calories he needs to burn by the number of days he has to lose weight. So, the deficit he needs each day is 105,000 / 62 ≈ 1693.55 calories.

\boxed{1693.55}</s>","January, March, and May have 31 days, February has 28, and April and June have 30, and Andy's birthday is on the 19th day of July. So there are 3 * 31 days + 28 + 2 * 30 days + 19 days = 93 days + 28 + 60 days + 19 days = <<3*31+28+2*30+19=200>>200 days until Andy's birthday.
He wants to lose 30 lbs. At 3500 calories per pound, this is 30 * 3500 = <<30*3500=105000>>105,000 calories total,

1. First, we need to calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of her initial $500.
   So, amount spent on clothes = Initial amount * Percentage spent
   = $500 * 0.20
   = $100

2. Next, we subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount to find out how much money Julie had left after buying clothes.
   Remaining amount after buying clothes = Initial amount - Amount spent on clothes
   = $500 - $100
   = $400

3. Then, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
   Amount spent on CDs = Remaining amount * Percentage spent
   = $400 * 0.25
   = $100

4. Finally, we subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount after buying clothes to find out how much money Julie had left in total.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, let's clarify the information given. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

2. Let's use variables to represent the unknown values. Let's say X represents the cost of the lot and Y represents the cost of the house.

3. From the information given, we can form two equations:

a) X + Y = $120,000 (This is from the total cost of the house and the lot)

b) Y = 3X (This is from the fact that the house costs three times as much as the lot)

4. Now, we need to solve these equations to find the cost of the house (Y). We can substitute the second equation into the first:

a) X + 3X = $120,000

5. Combine like terms:

a) 4X = $120,000

6. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for X:

a) X = $30,000

7. Now that we have the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house using the second equation:

a) Y = 3 * $30,000

8. Solve for Y:

a) Y = $90,000

So, the cost of the house is $90,000.

{The final answer is \boxed{90,000}}</s>","Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has before buying dinner.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Ali has from her $10 bills.
She has 4 $10 bills, so the total amount from $10 bills is 4 * $10 = $40.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Ali has from her $20 bills.
She has 6 $20 bills, so the total amount from $20 bills is 6 * $20 = $120.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Ali has.
The total amount is the sum of the amount from $10 bills and the amount from $20 bills. So, the total amount is $40 + $120 = $160.

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Ali gives to her sister.
She gives her sister half of the total amount of money. So, she gives her sister $160 / 2 = $80.

Step 5: Calculate the amount of money Ali has after giving money to her sister.
The amount of money Ali has after giving money to her sister is the total amount she had minus the amount she gave to her sister. So, the amount of money she has left is $160 - $80 = $80.

Step 6: Calculate the amount of money Ali uses to buy dinner.
She uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. So, the amount of money she uses to buy dinner is $80 * 3/5 = $48.

Step 7: Calculate the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner.
The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is the remaining amount after giving money to her sister minus the amount he used to buy dinner. So, the amount of money she has left is $80 - $48 = $32.

                    question:
                    Martha is ? knitting ? winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. They're ; triplets, so they're all the same ? size. : She : wants to ? make ! a hat, scarf, ? sweater, ; mittens, and socks for . each of them.

                [/INST] To calculate the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of items she wants to make for all three grandchildren. She wants to make hats, scarves, sweaters, mittens, and socks, which is a total of 5 items per grandchild. Since she has 3 grandchildren, she needs to make 3 grandchildren x 5 items per grandchild = 15 items in total.

2. Calculate the number of skeins needed for each item. For hats, she needs 2 skeins per hat; for scarves, she needs 4 skeins per scarf; for sweaters, she needs 12 skeins per sweater; for mittens, she needs 1 skein per pair of mittens; and for socks, she needs 2 skeins per pair of socks.

3. Now, multiply the number of each item by the number of skeins needed per item:
   - Hats: 3 grandchildren x 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
   - Scarves: 3 grandchildren x 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
   - Sweaters: 3 grandchildren x 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins
   - Mittens: 3 grandchildren x 1 skein per pair of mittens = 3 skeins
   - Socks: 3 grandchildren x 2 skeins per pair of socks = 6 skeins

4. Finally, add up all the skeins needed: 6 (for hats) + 12 (for scarves) + 36 (for sweaters) + 3 (for mittens) + 6 (for socks) = 63 skeins of wool in total.

So, {The final answer is} Martha needs to buy 63 skeins of wool.</s>","A full outfit for each child will require 2 skeins per hat + 4 skeins per scarf + 12 skeins per sweater + 1 skein per pair of mittens + 2 skeins per pair of socks = <<2+4+12+1+2=21>>21 skeins of wool.
So to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3 * 21 = <<3*21=63>>63 skeins of wool.

4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, to find out how many quarts of strawberries they can pick per hour in total, we add up each of their rates:

Tony's rate + Bobby's rate + Ricky's rate + Kathy's rate

2. Jackson has 24 blue tulips. Since he can fit 8 blue tulips in one row, the number of rows of blue tulips he will plant is 24 divided by 8.

\frac{24}{8} = 3 rows

3. Jackson is planting both red and blue tulips in separate rows. Therefore, to find the total number of rows of flowers he will plant, we add the number of rows of red tulips to the number of rows of blue tulips.

1. First, we need to find out how many cups of raisins Δ needs to divide equally among the Δ recipes. Since there are 3 recipes (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix), we divide the total cups of raisins by 3.

27 cups of raisins / 3 = 9 cups of raisins for each recipe.

2. Next, we calculate how many batches of oatmeal cookies Δ can make with the raisins allocated for each recipe. A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 cups of raisins. Therefore, we divide the number of cups of raisins for each recipe by the amount of raisins needed for each batch.

9 cups of raisins / (3/4 cups of raisins per batch) = 12 batches of oatmeal cookies for each recipe.

3. Finally, since Δ has allocated equal amounts of raisins for each of the 3 recipes, we multiply the number of batches she can make from one recipe by 3.

12 batches of oatmeal cookies per recipe * 3 recipes = 36 batches of oatmeal cookies in total.

{The final answer is 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.}</s>","Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.

If a , kilowatt per hour is $1.50, how much is the ! difference ? between Ada's weekly : electric ? bill before and ! after she adds : the , new device?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Calculate daily electric consumption before adding the device:**
   Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Assuming she uses electricity for 24 hours a day, her daily consumption is:
   Daily consumption before = 12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours = 288 kilowatts

2. **Calculate weekly electric consumption before adding the device:**
   To find out her weekly consumption, we multiply her daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
   Weekly consumption before = 288 kilowatts/day * 7 days = 2016 kilowatts

3. **Calculate daily electric consumption after adding the device:**
   The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. So, her new daily consumption is:
   Daily consumption after = (12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour) * 24 hours = 288 kilowatts + 48 kilowatts = 336 kilowatts

4. **Calculate weekly electric consumption after adding the device:**
   Again, multiply her new daily consumption by 7 to find out her weekly consumption:
   Weekly consumption after = 336 kilowatts/day * 7 days = 2352 kilowatts

5. **Calculate the difference in weekly electric bill:**
   The price of a kilowatt is $1.50. So, the difference in her weekly electric bill is:
   Difference = 2352 kilowatts - 2016 kilowatts * $1.50/kilowatt = 336 kilowatts * $1.50/kilowatt = $504

So, the final answer is {The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill between before and after adding the new device is $504}.</s>","Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.
So, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.
So her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.
Ada's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147
Therefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.

                [/INST] It takes one person the equivalent of 5 houses to paint in one day.

So, one person can paint \(\frac{1}{5}\) of a house in 5 days.

Therefore, one person can paint \((\frac{1}{5}) \times 5 = 1\) house in 5 days.

This means that the person paints at a rate of \(\frac{1}{5} \) of a house per day and therefore at a rate of \( \frac{1}{5 \times 5} = \frac{1}{25} \) of a house per hour.

Hence, if we have 5 people, one for each job, these people will be able to paint a whole house in \( \frac{1}{\frac{5 \times 1}{25}} \) hours.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so we need to find out how many chairs Ophelia has.

Chairs Ophelia has = Sofas Ophelia has + 2
= 20 + 2
= 22 chairs

3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so we need to find out how many chairs Jenna has.

Chairs Jenna has = Chairs Ophelia has × 3
= 22 × 3
= 66 chairs

4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so we need to find out how many sofas Jenna has.

Sofas Jenna has = Chairs Jenna has - 2
= 66 - 2
= 64 sofas

5. Now, we need to find the total number of sofas and chairs they have.

Total chairs = Sofas Ophelia has + Sofas Jenna has
= 20 + 64
= 84 chairs

Total sofas = Sofas Ophelia has + Sofas Jenna has
= 20 + 64
= 84 sofas

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs they have is 84 each.

Final answer: The total number of sofas is \boxed{84}, and the total number of chairs is \boxed{84}.</s>","If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.

The total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 66+22 = <<66+22=88>>88
Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the total number of sofas she has is 66-2 = <<66-2=64>>64 sofas.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break down the information and the steps:

1. Tom bought x CDs and a headphone set for a total of $48.

2. Each CD costs $4, and the headphone set costs an unknown amount.

3. If Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy more CDs with the same amount of money.

Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as H. We can set up the following equation:
4x + H = 48

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set. The cost of x CDs would still be 4x. So, we can rewrite the equation as:
4x = 48 - H

Since we don't know the cost of the headphone set, we can't calculate the exact number of CDs. However, we can determine the number of CDs that Tom could have bought for every dollar he spent on the headphone set.

Let's find the number of CDs Tom could have bought if he spent 1 dollar less on the headphone set:
4x = 48 - (H - 1)
4x = 49 - H

Now, let's find the difference in the number of CDs between the two scenarios:
(49 - H) - (48 - H) = 1

So, for every dollar Tom spends on the headphone set instead of CDs, he would have been able to buy 1 more CD.

Since the problem states that Tom decided to buy the headphone set, we cannot determine the exact number of CDs he could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set. We only know that for every dollar he spent on the headphone set, he could have bought 1 more CD.

Final answer: {The final answer is that Tom could have bought 1 more CD for every dollar he spent on the headphone set. However, without knowing the exact cost of the headphone set, we cannot determine the exact number of additional CDs.}

(Note: The answer could be expressed as a range, if there is given information about the range of the headphone set cost.)</s>","The headphone set cost was 48 - 4 = $<<48-4=44>>44.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people riding the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off the bus.
3. 5 times as many people as got off from the first stop, get into the bus. That means 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus.
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is 48 - 8 (those who got off) + 40 (those who got on) = 80 passengers.
5. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off the bus.
6. 3 times fewer passengers get on from the second stop than got off from the first stop. So, 3 * (5 * 8) / 3 = 40 (those who got off from the first stop = 5 * 8) passengers get on the bus.
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is 80 - 21 (those who got off from the second stop) + 40 (those who got on from the second stop) = 100 passengers.

So, after the second stop, there are 100 passengers riding the bus.

{The final answer is 100}</s>","At the first stop, 5 * 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 passengers get on the bus.
After the first stop the bus has ( 48 - 8 ) + 40 = <<48-8+40=80>>80 passengers.
At the second stop, 21 / 3 = <<21/3=7>>7 passengers get on the bus.
After the second stop there are ( 80 - 21 ) + 7 = <<80-21+7=66>>66 passengers.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jame will turn 27 years old in 5 years.
This means Jame is currently 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
First, let's find out how old Jame will be in 8 years: 22 + 8 = 30 years old.
Twice Jame's age in 8 years would be 30 * 2 = 60 years old.
Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than this, so the cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

3. Now, let's find out how old Jame's cousin is currently: 55 - 8 = 47 years old.

4. To find out how many years separate Jame and his cousin now, we subtract Jame's current age from his cousin's current age: 47 - 22 = 25 years.

Therefore, there are 25 years between Jame and his cousin's age now.

The final answer is: {25 years}</s>","James is 27-5=<<27-5=22>>22 years old
In 8 years he will be 22+8=<<22+8=30>>30 years old
So in 8 years, his cousin will be 30*2-5=<<30*2-5=55>>55
So his cousin is 55-8=<<55-8=47>>47 years old now
So there is a 47-22=<<47-22=25>>25 year gap

1. Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400.

2. The computer cost $1,100.

3. We know that the printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

4. Now, we want to find the cost of one monitor. Let's denote this cost as M.

5. We know that the total cost is $2,400, so we can set up the equation: $1,100 (computer) + $700 (printer) + 2M (two monitors) = $2,400.

6. Solving for M, we get: 2M = $2,400 - $1,100 - $700, which simplifies to 2M = $600.

7. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that M = $300.

So, the cost of one monitor is \boxed{300}.</s>","He paid 1100-400=<<1100-400=700>>700 for the printer.

Let's break it down:

1. The boys went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each. Since there are two groups of girls and boys, there are also two groups of boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 2 groups * 60 shells/group = 120 shells.

2. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is 120 shells (from the boys) + 4 * 120 shells = 540 shells.

3. Since the girls and boys were divided into two equal groups, there are also two groups of girls. So, the total number of seashells brought by all the girls is 540 shells / 2 groups = 270 shells/group.

4. Finally, since each group of girls brought 270 seashells, each girl brought 270 seashells / 2 girls/group = 135 seashells.

So, the final answer is \boxed{135}.</s>","When they divided, each group had 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 students.

2. George then ate 5 candies.
3. After eating, George has 3 candies left.

Let's denote the original number of candies George had as G.

From the information given:

George's candies = G - 5 = 3

Solving for G:
G = 3 + 5
G = 8

George had 8 candies initially.

1. First, let's calculate the total cost of the dinner bill, including the 20% tip. The original bill is $50, and the tip is 20% of that, so the tip is 0.20 * $50 = $10.

2. The total cost after adding the tip is $50 (original bill) + $10 (tip) = $60.

3. The original bill was to be split evenly between two people, so if the original bill of $50 was split evenly, each person would pay $50 / 2 = $25.

4. However, you ended up paying the entire bill of $60, including the tip.

So, {The final answer is} you ended up paying $60 for the dinner.</s>","If the total bill is $50, the total tip of 20% would be $50*20% = $<<50*20*.01=10>>10

2. The eldest boy then adds $5 to his share, making his new total:
$6 + $5 = $11

3. The following day, he adds another $10 to his total:
$11 + $10 = $21

4. He then spends $8 from his total so far:
$21 - $8 = $13

5. After saving some more, he is able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8:

1. First, we need to find out how much Elvis saves in the first half of the month. Let's denote this amount as x.

2. According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month. So, in the second half, he saves 2x.

3. Since Elvis wants to reach his monthly saving target of $1125, we can set up the following equation: x (first half savings) + 2x (second half savings) = $1125.

4. Simplifying the equation gives us: 3x = $1125.

5. Solving for x (the amount saved in the first half), we get: x = $1125 / 3 = $375.

6. Now, we need to find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month. There are 15 days in the second half of the month.

Total earnings of Jenny = 20 * $0.5 = $10

Now, to find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total earnings from Jairus's:

Difference = Jairus's earnings - Jenny's earnings
Difference = $16 - $10 = $6

{The final answer is Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.}</s>","The difference of the amount received by Jairus and Jenny is $0.8/task - $0.5/task = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3/task.

1. Elise writes ""it"" twice. Since ""it"" has two letters, she writes 2 * 2 = 4 letters.

2. Next, she writes ""! half of it"" once. The phrase ""! half of it"" has 8 letters (including the two spaces). But since ""it"" is not included in this phrase, we don't count the 3 letters of ""it"" again. So, she writes 8 - 3 = 5 new letters.

3. Then, she re-writes everything she has already written. This includes ""it"" twice, ""! half of it"" once, and all the letters she has written so far. In total, she re-writes all 4 + 5 = 9 letters she has written so far.

4. To find the total number of letters she has written, we add the letters she wrote in each step: 4 (from step 1) + 5 (from step 2) + 9 (from step 3) = 18 letters.

1. Jonathan needs 2 more toys to make his play set five times larger than James's play set.
2. If James's play set has 80 toys, then five times the size of James's play set is 5 * 80 = 400 toys.
3. Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys to reach this number, we subtract 2 from 400.
4. This gives us 398 toys, which is the number Jonathan needs to make his play set five times larger.
5. However, since Jonathan currently doesn't have this number of toys, we need to consider the size of his current play set.
6. If Jonathan's play set is a sorted play set, it must be half the size of his desired play set (since he's aiming for 398 toys but wants a full 2x size increase).
7. Therefore, we divide 398 by 2 to find the size of his current play set.

2. To find out how much she earned from the $1000 worth of goods, we calculate a 30% commission:
   $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.3 = $300

3. The remaining amount ($1500) is above the $1000 threshold, so she will earn an additional 10% commission on this amount. However, this additional commission only applies to the amount above $1000:
   $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.1 = $150

4. To find the total commission Antonella earned, we add the two amounts:

1. Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes in cold water.
2. Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes in warm water, which is more than twice as long as swimm
ing in cold water.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in hot water. Since it's more than twice as long as swimming in cold water, we can find the time by multiplying the warm water time by 2 and then finding the result that is more than twice the cold water time.

Warm water time = 2 minutes
Twice the cold water time = 16 minutes * 2 = 32 minutes
Since it's more than twice as long, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 34 minutes for hot water.

Now, let's find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day.

Cold water time for 3 miles = 16 minutes * 3 = 48 minutes
Hot water time for 3 miles = 34 minutes * 3 = 102 minutes

The difference in time is:
102 minutes (hot) - 48 minutes (cold) = 54 minutes

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 21 buttons in total.
2. There are seven buttons with two holes each. So, the total number of holes on these buttons is 2 * 7 = 14 holes.
3. The rest of the buttons have four holes each. Since we know there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, there must be 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with four holes each. So, the total number of holes on these buttons is 4 * 14 = 56 holes.
4. To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we add the number of holes from the first group of buttons to the number of holes from the second group. So, 14 + 56 = 70 holes.

\boxed{70}</s>","There were 21 - 7 = <<21-7=14>>14 buttons with four holes.
The four-holed buttons had 14 * 4 = <<14*4=56>>56 holes.
The two-holed buttons had 7 * 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 holes.
Thus, there were 56 + 14 = <<56+14=70>>70 holes in all the buttons in the bag.

1. First, we find the size of Zack's locker. Since it is half the size of Timothy's locker, we calculate half of 24 cubic inches.
   Half of 24 = 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.

2. Next, we find the size of Peter's locker. Since it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we calculate 1/4 of Zack's locker size.
   1/4 of 12 cubic inches = 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches.

                [/INST] The problem can be broken down into the following steps:

1. We need to find out how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily, which is given by half of the daily recommended amount. However, the problem doesn't specify how many cups are recommended for a day. Let's denote the total recommended amount as R. So, Octavia drinks R/2 cups of coffee.

2. Next, we know that Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks 10 * (R/2) = 5R cups of coffee.

3. We are given that Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, which is 4R cups in terms of R.

4. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake. So, the reduction amount is 5R - 4R = R cups.

So, the final answer is that Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by {boxed R} cups.</s>","Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups
Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which translates to 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups
Subtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan’s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups
Juan must therefore reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups

1. First, we need to calculate the total number of rodents in each type of cage. For the 3 cages with hamsters, we have:
   \[
   \text{Total hamsters} = 3 \text{ cages} \times 10 \text{ hamsters per cage} = 30 \text{ hamsters}

2. Next, for the 3 cages with guinea pigs, we have:
   \[
   \text{Total guinea pigs} = 3 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ guinea pigs per cage} = 15 \text{ guinea pigs}
   \]

3. Finally, to find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs together:
   \[
   \text{Total rodents} = \text{Total hamsters} + \text{Total guinea pigs} = 30 + 15 = 45

Next, let's calculate Bob's weight: Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 130 * 2 = 260 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the three friends: Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan weighs 130 pounds, and Bob weighs 260 pounds. So, the total weight is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

1. We know that the angle from the ground to the pyramid is 32 degrees.
2. The sun is moving at a rate of 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.
3. If the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid (which is 32 degrees above the ground), and moves straight upward from that point, the angle it makes with the ground after 10 hours will be the sum of the initial angle (32 degrees) and the angle it moves upward (5 degrees per hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees).
4. So, the total angle between the ground and the sun after 10 hours will be the sum of these two angles: 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.

Therefore, {The final answer is the angle between the ground and the sun will be 82 degrees}.</s>","5 degrees an hour for 10 hours 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 degrees

                [/INST] James's 12-year-old son will get 15 candles because he is the older son.

His younger son is 4 years younger than the older son, so the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

James can buy packs of 5 candles that cost $3 each.

To find out how many packs James needs to buy for his 12-year-old son, we need to divide the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack: 15 candles / 5 candles/pack = 3 packs.

To find out how many packs James needs to buy for his 8-year-old son, we need to divide the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack: 8 candles / 5 candles/pack = 1.6 packs. Since James cannot buy a fraction of a pack, he must buy 2 packs for the younger son.

So, James needs to buy a total of 3 packs for the older son and 2 packs for the younger son: 3 packs + 2 packs = 5 packs.

The total cost of buying 5 packs is 5 packs x $3/pack = $15.

{The final answer is $15}.</s>","His younger son is 12-4=<<12-4=8>>8 years old

                [/INST] Let's break down this complex sentence into simpler parts to better understand the problem.

First, we need to determine how many minutes Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, the total number of minutes she read in the first week is:

15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes

Next, we know that Judy read a total of 100 pages in the second week. We also know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many minutes it took her to read these 100 pages, we can divide the total number of pages by her reading speed:

100 pages / (2 pages/1.5 minutes) = 75 minutes

So, in the second week, Judy read for 75 minutes.

Now, to find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we simply need to add the total number of pages she read in the first week (which we can calculate by multiplying her total reading time in the first week by her reading speed) to the total number of pages she read in the second week:

((105 minutes) * (2 pages/1.5 minutes)) + 100 = 140 + 100 = 240 pages

So, the final answer is that Judy read {240 pages} in two weeks.</s>","Every night, Judy reads 15 minutes/1.5 minutes = <<15/1.5=10>>10 sets of 2 pages.
So, she read 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 pages every night in the first week.
In the first week, she reads a total of 20 x 7 = <<20*7=140>>140 pages.
Therefore, she read a total of 140 + 100 = <<140+100=240>>240 pages in two weeks.

12 / 4 = 3

So, Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

Now, let's add up the sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate:

3. Finally, Sharon lost two more teeth, and for each, she received half the amount she received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, she received $0.50 for each of the last two teeth, which totals $1.00.

Now, we can add up the total amount of money Sharon received:

1. We know that Richie scored 80 goals.

2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored by subtracting 45 from the number of goals Richie scored. In other words, Anna's goals = Richie's goals - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

3. Richie also scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored by subtracting 20 from the number of goals Richie scored. In other words, Mark's goals = Richie's goals - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 goals.

4. Now, to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add the number of goals scored by each teenager. In other words, Total goals = Richie's goals + Anna's goals + Mark's goals = 80 + 35 + 60 = 175 goals.

For the : rest of the week, : he , will : buy plastic ! action figures which cost $2 . each. How ; many , total action figures will he ? have ! by , the ! end of the week?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Peter spends money on wooden action figures at $5 each from Sunday through Wednesday. Since a week has 7 days, these days are 4 days in total. So, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 days * $5/day = $20.

2. For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), he buys plastic action figures at $2 each. Since he already spent his money for 4 days, he has $70 - $20 = $50 left for the rest of the week. The rest of the week also has 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), so he can buy 3 days * ($50 / $2/day) = 75 action figures.

3. Now, let's add up all the action figures he bought. He bought 4 wooden action figures (4 days * $5 spent = 20, but each day he buys one, so 4 action figures) and 75 plastic action figures.

The final answer is: {Peter will have 4 wooden action figures + 75 plastic action figures = 79 action figures by the end of the week}.</s>","There are 7 days in a week so if he wishes to spend an equal amount of $70 each day that would be $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10
For four days (Sunday through Wednesday) he will spend 4*$10 = $<<4*10=40>>40
He will spend $40 on wooden action figures of $5 each which gives $40/$5 = <<40/5=8>>8 wooden action figures
For the remaining 3 days he will spend 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30
He will spend $30 on plastic action figures of $2 each which gives $30/$2 = <<30/2=15>>15 plastic action figures
Altogether, he will have 8+15 = <<8+15=23>>23 action figures.

                [/INST] Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. Leah got a new kitten. The cost of the kitten is not mentioned in the question, so we can't include it in our calculation. Let's assume the cost of the kitten is X dollars.

2. Spaying her cost $200. So, the cost now is $200 + X.

3. Her 3 vaccines costs $20 each. So, the cost of the vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60. The total cost is now $200 + $60 + X.

4. The kitten broke 4 vases that cost $12 each. So, the cost of the vases is 4 * $12 = $48. The total cost is now $200 + $60 + $48 + X.

5. Simplifying this gives us $200 + $60 + $48 + X = $200 + $60 + $48 + $100 = $308 + X.

6. The kitten cost so far is not enough information. We can't find the total cost without knowing the cost of the kitten (X).

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops in a week. We do this by adding the number of roses each shop orders:

Total roses per week = First shop orders + Second shop orders + Third shop orders
   = 20 + 15 + 30
   = 65 roses

2. Next, we need to calculate how many roses Ford grows in a month. We know there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so:

Roses grown per month = Roses grown per week * Weeks per month
   = 40 roses * 4 weeks
   = 160 roses

3. Now, we can find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month. We do this by subtracting the total roses Ford supplies in a week from the number of roses he grows in a month:

Roses needed to supply all shops = Roses grown per month - Total roses per week
   = 160 roses - 65 roses
   = 95 roses

{The final answer is 95 roses.}</s>","The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.
The second flower shop needs 15 x 4= <<15*4=60>>60 roses every month.
The third flower shop needs 30 x 4 = <<30*4=120>>120 roses every month.
So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
The total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160
Therefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.

1. Katina starts with $3000 in her savings account.
2. She withdraws $100 every month.
3. There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there will be 2 * 12 = 24 months.
4. Over 24 months, she will withdraw a total of 24 * $100 = $2400.
5. To find out how much money will be left in the account after 2 years, subtract the total amount withdrawn from her initial savings: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, {The final answer is} that $600 will be remaining within the account after 2 years.</s>","A year has 12 months, and since she withdraws money from the account every month, after 2 years, she will have withdrawn money for 2*12= <<24=24>>24 months.

1. First, we need to calculate the cost of making 10 sandwiches. This includes the cost of the bread and the cost of the cheeses and condiments.

Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = Number of loaves * Cost per loaf
= 1 loaf * $3.00 = $3.00

Cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00 (given)

Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments
= $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

2. Next, we calculate the revenue from selling 10 sandwiches.

Revenue = Number of sandwiches * Price per sandwich
= 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00

3. Finally, we calculate the net profit, which is the revenue minus the total cost.

Net profit = Revenue - Total cost

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons

Since each muffin crayon is made from 8 small pieces, we can find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make by dividing the total number of crayons by 8.

192 crayons / 8 pieces/crayon = 24 muffin crayons

Finally, to find out how much money Kate can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin crayon.

1. First, we need to calculate the total area of Michael's bedroom. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, the area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

2. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the new carpet. The new carpet costs $12 per square foot and the padding underneath costs $2 per square foot. So, the total cost for the carpet and padding is (12 + 2) * 216 = $27576.

3. Now, let's calculate the cost of removing the old carpet. This costs $4 per square foot, so the cost is 4 * 216 = $864.

4. Then, we need to calculate the cost of installing the new carpet. This costs $34 per square foot, so the cost is 34 * 216 = $7248.

5. Finally, to find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we add up the costs from steps 2, 3, and 4. So, the total cost is $27576 + $864 + $7248 = $35688.

2. Add half of the starting value to it. Half of 20 is 10, so we add 10 to 20:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]
3. Now, divide this resulting value by 5:
\[ 30 \div 5 = 6 \]
4. The next step is to multiply this value by the starting value minus 12:
\[ 6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 \]
5. Finally, multiply 6 by 8 to get the final value of the number train:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we first need to understand that Maggie's oven is not displaying the correct temperature; it's showing a lower temperature than the actual temperature. This means the oven's temperature is consistently off by a certain percentage.

Let's denote the actual temperature as T_a and the displayed temperature as T_d. We know that when Maggie sets the oven to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees. So, we can say that:

T_a = T_d * (1 + x)

where x is the percentage error in terms of a multiplier. We can rearrange this equation to find x:

x = (T_a - T_d) / T_d

Substituting the given values:

x = (468 - 450) / 450

Solving this gives us x = 0.03 (or 3%).

Now, we want to find the setting needed for an actual temperature of 520 degrees. Using the same relationship as before:

520 = T_d * (1 + 0.03)

Rearranging to find T_d:

T_d = 520 / (1 + 0.03)

Solving this gives us T_d = 497.71 (approximately). Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 498 degrees to achieve the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

So, the final answer is \boxed{498}.</s>","The oven off by 18 degrees because 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18
The oven is off by 4% because 18 / 450 x 100 = <<18/450*100=4>>4%
Therefore X + .04X = 520
Therefore 1.04X = 520
The temperature to set it is 500 because 520 / 1.04 = <<520/1.04=500>>500

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we know that Herb's house is worth $76,000.
2. We are told that Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's. So, to find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of $76,000 and subtract that from $76,000.

30% of $76,000 is 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800.

1. Subtracting this from the value of Herb's house gives us the value of Juan's house: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.
2. Now, to find the combined value of both houses, we simply add the values together: $76,000 (Herb's house) + $53,200 (Juan's house) = $129,200.

Therefore, the combined value of the two houses is \boxed{$129,200}.</s>","Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, meaning Juan's house is 30/100*$76000= $<<30/100*76000=22800>>22800 less expensive than Herb's house.
Juan's house is worth $76000-$22800 = $<<76000-22800=53200>>53200
The combined total value of Juan's and Herb's house is $76000+$53200 = $<<76000+53200=129200>>129200

Judy brought a dozen (12) cups.
Her friend brought 40 cups.

Let's find out the difference in the number of cups:
40 - 12 = 28 cups

Judy's friend brought twice as many dishes as cups, so:
2 * 12 = 24 dishes

Now we know that Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so:
24 + 20 = 44 dishes (brought by Judy's friend)

Judy brought half the number of dishes as her friend, so:
44 / 2 = 22 dishes

Now, let's find the total number of utensils Judy brought:
12 cups + 22 dishes = 34 utensils

Judy's friend brought the same number of utensils as Judy:
34 utensils (Judy's utensils) + 40 cups + 44 dishes (her friend's utensils) = 140 utensils

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is:
34 utensils (Judy) + 140 utensils (her friend) = 178 utensils

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, let's determine how many pairs of contacts are in one box. Since it's mentioned they come in pairs, and there are 90 single contacts in one box, there would be 90/2 = 45 pairs in one box.

2. Next, if Peter buys one box, it will last him for 45 days. Therefore, in one day, he uses one pair of contacts.

3. The cost of one box is $100.00, and there is currently a 10% discount. So, the discount on one box is 10% of $100.00, which is $10.00.

4. Therefore, the cost of one box after the discount is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

5. If Peter buys two boxes, the cost will be 2 * $90.00 = $180.00.

6. Since he uses one pair of contacts a day, and he buys two boxes, he will have enough contacts for 45 (from the first box) + 45 (from the second box) = 90 days.

7. So, the number of days each pair of contacts will last is still 1 day, as mentioned in the problem.

8. Therefore, if Peter buys two boxes, he will have enough contacts for 90 days, with a total cost of $180.00.

{The final answer is: Peter will have enough contacts for 90 days, with a total cost of $180.00.}</s>","Each box of contacts is $100.00 with 10% off so that's 100*.10 = $<<100*.10=10.00>>10.00 off
So the box was $100.00 and he has $10.00 off so each box will cost 100-10 = $<<100-10=90.00>>90.00
He buys 2 boxes and each box costs $90.00 so that's 2*90= $<<2*90=180.00>>180.00
1 box of contacts has 90 contacts and he buys 2 boxes so that's 90*2 = <<90*2=180>>180 contacts
He needs 1 contact for each eye and he has 180 contacts so that's 180/2 = <<180/2=90>>90 pairs of contacts
He spent $180.00 to have 90 pairs of contacts so each pair of contacts costs 180/90 = $<<180/90=2.00>>2.00 a pair

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step.

1. First, let's determine how long John worked on Saturday and Sunday. Since John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, that means he worked for 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. And since he worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, that means he worked for 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.

2. Now, let's calculate how much John earned. He worked for 4 hours on Saturday and 3 hours on Sunday, which is a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. Since he gets paid $10 an hour, John earned 7 * $10 = $70.

3. Next, let's calculate how much Jill earned. She worked for 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, which is a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Since she also gets paid $10 an hour, Jill earned 3 * $10 = $30.

4. Finally, to find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings. So, John earned $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill.

So, the final answer is {John earned $40 more than Jill}.</s>","Jill worked 2 hours + 1 hour for a total of 3 hours.
Jill worked 3 hours at $10/hour so she made 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30
John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday so 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday so 3*1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours
John worked 4 hours + 3 hours for 7 hours
John worked 7 hours at $10/hour so he made 7*10 = $<<7*10=70>>70
John made $70 while Jill made $30 so $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 more dollars

Aerobics calories = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Running calories = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = Aerobics calories + Running calories = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Next, we need to find out how many 200-calorie blocks are in the total calories burned. This is because Hannah drinks 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

Number of blocks = Total calories burned / 200 calories/block = 1600 calories / 200 calories/block = 8 blocks

Finally, we multiply the number of blocks by the amount of water she drinks per block to find the total amount of water she needs to drink.

Total water needed = Number of blocks * Water per block = 8 blocks * 100 ml/block

\boxed{800} The final answer is 800 ml of water. Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.</s>","First find the total calories burned on aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = <<2*500=1000>>1000 calories

Finally, divide that number by the ratio of calories burned to water drunk to find how many water Hannah needs to drink: 1600 calories * 100 ml/200 calories = <<1600*100/200=800>>800 ml

Step 1: Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B.

Step 2: According to the problem, there is 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans. So, the number of red jelly beans can be represented as 0.99B.

Step 3: Similarly, there is 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. So, the number of green jelly beans can be represented as 1.01B.

Step 4: We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500. So, we can create an equation: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500.

Step 5: Simplifying the equation, we get 3B = 4500.

Step 6: Solving for B, we find that B = 4500 / 3 = 1500. So, there are 1500 blue jelly beans.

Step 7: Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. The number of red jelly beans is 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485. The number of green jelly beans is 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

Step 8: Finally, we want to find out how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans. So, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1515 - 1485 = 30.

1. **First measurement**: Jared starts with a typing speed of 47 words per minute (WPM).

2. **Second measurement**: After some lessons, his typing speed increases to 52 WPM.

3. **Third measurement**: If he continues to increase his typing speed by 5 WPM once more, his new typing speed would be $52 + 5 = 57$ WPM.

4. **Calculating the average**: To find the average of the three measurements, we add them together and divide by the number of measurements. The formula for the average ($\bar{x}$) is given by:

\[
   \bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3}
   \]

   where $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ are the first, second, and third measurements, respectively. Substituting the values we have:

\[
   \bar{x} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying the numerator:

\[
   \bar{x} = \frac{156}{3}

   Dividing both sides by 3:

\[
   \bar{x} = 52

1. If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss would be:

Total weight loss = Weight loss per week * Number of weeks
Total weight loss = 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks
Total weight loss = 6.25 pounds

2. If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain would be:

Total weight gain = Weight gain per week * Number of weeks
Total weight gain = 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks
Total weight gain = 8.75 pounds

3. Now, let's find the difference in weight between the two options after 5 weeks:

Difference = Total weight gain - Total weight loss
Difference = 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds)
Difference = 15 pounds

So, the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options would be 15 pounds.

The final answer is: {The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 15 pounds.}</s>","First find the difference in weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds/week - ( -1.25 pounds/week) = 1.75 pounds/week + 1.25 pounds/week = <<1.75-(-1.25)=3>>3 pounds/week
Then multiply the weight gain per week by the number of weeks to find the total difference at the end of 5 weeks: 5 weeks * 3 pounds/week = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds

1. On the 0th day, the beanstalk is 4 feet tall.

2. The beanstalk grows to (4 * 2^1 = 8 feet) on the 1st day.

3. The beanstalk grows to (8 * 2^1 = 16 feet) on the 2nd day.

4. The beanstalk grows to (16 * 2^1 = 32 feet) on the 3rd day.

The beanstalk has surpassed the height of the second-story window on the 4th day.

Therefore, the beanstalk will take 4 days to be taller than Mark's second-story window.

{The final answer is four days.}</s>","To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet

To find its height after three days, multiply the height after two days by 2: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. This is taller than the window, so it took three days for the beanstalk to pass the window.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much protein John eats in a day. If 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms (which is double the amount) would contain double the amount of protein. So, 200 grams of mushrooms contain 3 * 2 = 6 grams of protein.

2. Next, to find out how much protein John eats in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). So, 6 grams of protein per day * 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week.

So, the final answer is {John gets 42 grams of protein per week}.</s>","He eats 200/100=<<200/100=2>>2 cups per day

                [/INST] It seems like the question is cut off, and I couldn't make sense of the given information. Here's an example problem that I believe is similar to the one in your message:

Jerry's current age is twice what it was 5 years ago. How old will Jerry be in 3 years?

Step 1: Jerry's current age is twice what it was 5 years ago. This means that 5 years ago, Jerry was 1/2 of his current age.

Step 2: Let's call Jerry's current age J. According to

Step 1, 5 years ago, Jerry's age was J/2.

Step 3: Since it's 5 years later, we can express Jerry's age 5 years ago as J - 5. Therefore, we have the equation: J/2 = J - 5.

Step 4: Solve for J by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2: J = 2(J - 5).

Step 5: Distribute the 2 on the right side: J = 2J - 10.

Step 6: Subtract J from both sides: J - 2J = -10.

Step 7: Simplify the equation: -J = -10.

Step 8: Multiply both sides by -1: J = 10. Jerry is currently 10 years old.

Step 9: To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13.

Step 10: The final answer is 13 years old, so we write \boxed{13}.</s>","We know that Jerry's Age/2 = Jerry's Age - 5
Therefore Jerry's Age = 2 Jerry's age - 10
Therefore -Jerry's Age = - 10
Therefore Jerry's Age = <<10=10>>10
In three years Jerry will be 13 because 10 + 3 = <<10+3=13>>13

2. The additional cost for the crown is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is $4000 + $500 = ${4500}.
3. George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, he still needs to pay ${4500 - $600 = ${3900}.
4. George makes $15 per hour at work. So, he needs to work {3900 / 15 = {260}} hours to pay for the dental work.

The angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
Let's denote the smallest angle as x degrees.
The problem states that one angle is twice the smallest angle, and the third angle is three times the smallest angle. So, the angles are x, 2x, and 3x degrees respectively.
Using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can set up the following equation:
x + 2x + 3x = 180
This simplifies to 6x = 180
Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 6:
x = 30
So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees, the second angle is 60 degrees (2*30), and the largest angle is 90 degrees (3*30).
Therefore, the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.</s>","Let x be the measure of the smallest angle

- Quarters: 8 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes * $0.10/dime = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies * $0.01/penny = $0.15

Step 2: Add up the total value of all the coins Colby has.
Total value = $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Step 3: Determine how many gumballs Colby can buy with his total coin value.
Since each gumball costs a nickel, or $0.05, we divide the total coin value by the cost of one gumball.

1. Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours.
2. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. So, Ruiz's production rate is 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour. Therefore, Marissa's production rate is 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.
3. They work for 12 hours in a day.

- Marissa's daily production = Production rate * Hours worked = 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they made together:

                [/INST] First, let's find out how much money Howard spent on Tuesday. Since he spent twice as much as he did on Monday, we calculate:

Tuesday's spending = Monday's spending * 2
= $8 * 2
= $16

Next, let's find out how much money Howard spent on Wednesday. Since he spent 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, we calculate:

Wednesday's spending = Tuesday's spending * 4
= $16 * 4
= $64

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he spent from Monday to Wednesday:

Total spending = Monday's spending + Tuesday's spending + Wednesday's spending
= $8 + $16 + $64
= $88

Finally, to find out how much money Howard has left, we subtract the total spending from the amount of money he originally had:

Money left = Original amount - Total spending
= $100 - $88
= $12

\boxed{12}</s>","On Tuesday, he spends $8 * 2 = $<<8*2=16>>16.
On Wednesday, he spends $16 * 4 = $<<16*4=64>>64.
In total he spent $8 + $16 + $64 = $<<8+16+64=88>>88 at the arcade.
He has $100 - $88 = $<<100-88=12>>12 left.

                [/INST] To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to calculate the total revenue from each period and then sum them up.

1. In the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, the revenue for the first 4 hours is:
   Revenue = Price per cup * Number of cups sold per hour * Hours
   Revenue = $0.50 * 15 cups * 4 hours = $30

2. In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, the revenue for the next 2 hours is:
   Revenue = Price per cup * Number of cups sold per hour * Hours
   Revenue = $0.60 * 10 cups * 2 hours = $12

3. Now, to find the total revenue for 6 hours, we add the revenue from the first 4 hours and the revenue from the next 2 hours:
   Total revenue = Revenue for first 4 hours + Revenue for next 2 hours
   Total revenue = $30 + $12 = $42

Therefore, Patrick earned $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

The final answer is {The final answer is $42}.</s>","Patrick earned $0.50 x 15 = $<<0.5*15=7.50>>7.50 from selling the lemonade for $0.50 per cup.
So for four hours, his total earnings are $7.50 x 4 = $<<7.5*4=30>>30.
He earned $0.60 x 10 = $<<0.60*10=6>>6 from selling the lemonade for $0.60 per cup.
So for two hours, his total earnings are $6 x 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.
Therefore, Patrick earn a total of $30 + $12 = $<<30+12=42>>42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Jeremy drives in a year and then determine how many rotations that corresponds to. We can then use the number of rotations each tire can handle to find out how many years the tire will last.

1. Calculate the total distance Jeremy drives in a year:
Jeremy drives 400 miles per month and there are 12 months in a year. Therefore, the total distance Jeremy drives in a year is:
Total distance = Miles per month * Months per year
= 400 miles * 12 months
= 4800 miles

2. Calculate the number of rotations that corresponds to the total distance:
The car tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles. So if Jeremy drives 4800 miles in a year, the number of rotations the tires make is:
Rotations = Rotations per mile * Total distance
= 725 rotations * 4800 miles
= 33600000 rotations

3. Calculate the number of years the tire will last:
Each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations. If the tires make 33,600,000 rotations in a year, the number of years a tire will last is:
Years = Total rotations / Rotations per tire
= 33,600,000 rotations / 10,440,000 rotations
≈ 3.218 years

\boxed{3.218} {The final answer is}</s>","Jeremy drives 400/2=<<400/2=200>>200 segments of 2 miles

So the tire can last for 10,440,000/145,000=<<10440000/145000=72>>72 months
That means the tires will last 72/12=<<72/12=6>>6 years

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we can break it down into the following steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many pumps Jackie will use in total. Since the shampoo lasts for 120 washings and she uses 1 pump per wash, she will use a total of 120 pumps.

2. Next, we need to convert the cost of the shampoo from dollars to cents. Since $1 is equal to 100 cents, $24.00 is equal to 2400 cents.

3. Finally, to find out how much each pump will cost in cents, we divide the total cost of the shampoo in cents by the total number of pumps used.

The calculation would be as follows:

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total pumps
= 2400 cents / 120 pumps
= 20 cents

So, the final answer is \boxed{20}.</s>","2 pumps will give you 120 washes so if she only uses 1 pump per wash she doubles the number of washes so she now has 120*2 = <<120*2=240>>240 washes

                [/INST] To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount on the shirt. The shirt has a 30% off sale, so Joe will save 30% of $25 on the shirt.
   Discount on shirt = 25 * 0.3 = $7.

2. Calculate the discount on the shorts. The shorts also have a 30% off sale, so Joe will save 30% of $35 on the shorts.
   Discount on shorts = 35 * 0.3 = $10.5

3. Calculate the total amount Joe will spend on the outfit. This is the sum of the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts.
   Total amount spent = Discounted price of shirt + Discounted price of shorts
    - Discounted price of shirt = Original price of shirt - Discount on shirt = $25 - $7 = $18
    - Discounted price of shorts = Original price of shorts - Discount on shorts = $35 - $10.5 = $24.5
    - Total amount spent = $18 + $24.5 = $42.5

4. Calculate how much money Joe will have left after the purchase. This is the difference between the amount of money Joe has and the total amount Joe will spend.
   Money left = Joe's money - Total amount spent = $50 - $42.5 = $7.5

Then, to find out how much butter Juan needs to make 50 croissants a week, we need to calculate how much butter is needed for 50 croissants divided by the number of croissants made in one day (4 dozen or 48 croissants).

1/4 pound * 50 croissants = 12.5 pounds of butter for 50 croissants

So, Juan will need to prepare 12.5 pounds of butter to make 48 croissants a day for a week.

1. John initially gets $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. That's $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. The research ends up taking 10 times longer than initially planned. So, if the first 5 months were planned, the total time taken becomes 5 * 10 = 50 months.

3. After the first 5 months, John needs 50% more funding per month. If the initial funding was $100,000 for 5 months, the monthly funding for the first 5 months is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000.

4. For the remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months), he needs 50% more funding. So, the additional funding needed per month is $20,000 * 50% = $10,000. Therefore, the total monthly funding for these months is $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000.

5. So, for the next 45 months, he spends $30,000 per month, which totals to 45 * $30,000 = $1,350,000.

6. Adding this to the initial $100,000 for the first 5 months, the total cost of his research is $1,350,000 + $100,000 = $1,450,000.

                [/INST] Here's the step-by-step reasoning for this problem:

1. First, we need to find the total number of seats in the school auditorium. Since there are 4 rows of seats and each row has 18 seats, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row:
   Total seats = Rows * Seats per row
   = 4 * 18
   = 72 seats

2. Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by them, so we calculate:
   Administrator seats = Total seats / 4
   = 72 / 4
   = 18 seats

3. Now, we subtract the seats taken by the administrators from the total number of seats to find the remaining seats:
   Remaining seats = Total seats - Administrator seats
   = 72 - 18
   = 54 seats

4. A third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so we calculate:
   Parent seats = Remaining seats / 3
   = 54 / 3
   = 18 seats

5. Finally, we subtract the seats taken by the parents and the administrators from the remaining seats to find the number of student seats:
   Student seats = Remaining seats - Parent seats - Administrator seats
   = 54 - 18 - 18
   = 18 seats

The final answer is that there were 18 students in the school auditorium. {The final answer is \boxed{18}}</s>","There are 4 x 18 = <<4*18=72>>72 seats in the school auditorium.
72 x1/4 = <<72*1/4=18>>18 seats were occupied by the administrators.

Since each of the 4 intersections has 6 poles and each pole has 4 street lights, we can calculate the total number of street lights using the following steps:

1. First, we calculate the total number of poles at the intersections:
\[ \text{Total poles} = 6 \text{ poles/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 24 \text{ poles} \]

2. Next, we calculate the total number of street lights:
\[ \text{Total street lights} = 4 \text{ street lights/pole} \times 24 \text{ poles} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

3. Given that 20 street lights are not working, we subtract this number from the total number of street lights to find the number of functioning street lights:
\[ \text{Functioning street lights} = 96 \text{ total street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

1. The first DVD has been played 356 times, and it can be played 1000 more times before it breaks. So, the number of remaining plays for the first DVD is:
   1000 - 356 = 644 plays

2. The second DVD has been played 135 times, and it can also be played 1000 more times before it breaks. So, the number of remaining plays for the second DVD is:

Next, we find out the total number of hours he went to physical therapy by multiplying the number of weeks by the number of hours per week:

4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours

Finally, to find out how much the physical therapy cost, we multiply the total number of hours by the cost per hour:

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jim has a pack of gum. Since he chews one piece every 2 hours and he's at school for 8 hours, he chews 4 pieces of gum during the school day (8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces).
2. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school. So, he has chewed 5 pieces so far (4 pieces during the day + 1 piece on the way home).
3. He chews 1 stick after dinner. Now he has chewed 6 pieces in total (5 pieces before dinner + 1 piece after dinner).
4. He gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister right before bed. Since he started with 20 pieces of gum, he has 14 pieces left (20 pieces - 6 pieces = 14 pieces).
5. He gives half of the remaining 14 pieces to his sister. This means he gives her 7 pieces (14 pieces / 2).
6. Therefore, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day (14 pieces - 7 pieces = 7 pieces).

The final answer is that Jim has \boxed{7} pieces of gum left at the end of the day.</s>","Jim goes to school for 8 hours, so if he chews 1 stick of gum every 2 hours that means he chews 8/2= <<8/2=4>>4 sticks of gum

His sister asks for half his remaining gum. Jim started with 20 and has chewed 6, so he has 20-6=<<20-6=14>>14 sticks left
This means Jim gives her 14/2=<<14/2=7>>7 sticks of gum

Ashley's internet speed in Mb per minute = 20 kb per second * (1 Mb / 1000 kb) = 0.02 Mb per second

The number of Mb transferred in one hour = 0.02 Mb per second * 60 seconds = 1.2 Mb

First, we need to determine the days of the week being referred to:

Let's assume that the first three days correspond to the weekdays Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and the remaining days correspond to Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed for each day of the week:

* For Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 10 cars each day
* For Thursday, Friday, and Saturday: (10 - 4) = 4 cars each day

Now we calculate the total number of cars towed for each type of day:

* Weekdays: 3 days x 10 cars each = 30 cars
* Weekend: 3 days x 6 cars each = 18 cars

Finally, we add the total number of cars towed on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of cars towed in the week:

Total cars towed = 30 (weekdays) + 18 (weekends) = 48 cars

Therefore, the tow truck towed {The final answer is 48} cars that week.</s>","On the first three days, towing ten cars a day, the tow truck pulled 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 cars.

Now, Adam grows 2 inches a year. Let's convert this to feet too.

3. 2 inches = 2/12 = 0.167 feet.

So, Adam grows 0.167 feet a year.

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the rollercoaster.

4. The difference between Adam's current height and the requirement is 4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet.
5. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow this much, we divide the total height he needs to grow by his annual growth rate: 0.67 feet / 0.167 feet/year.

                [/INST] First, we need to find out how much money the company paid James for the cars.

The company paid 30% of the price that James sold the cars for, so let's calculate that.

Price of one car = $25,000
Number of cars sold = 10

So, the company paid James $25,000/\*10 = $25,000

Next, we need to find out how much money James made from selling the cars.

James sold 10 cars, so he made $25,000/\*10 = $25,000

Now, we need to find out how much money James made from his commission on the profits.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, and the profits were $25,000 - $25,000 = $25,000

So, James made $25,000/\*0.1 = $2,500 from his commission.

Finally, we need to find out how much money James made in total.

James made $25,000 from selling the cars and $2,500 from his commission, so James made $25,000 + $2,500 = \boxed{27,500}. The final answer is $27,500.</s>","He sold the car for 25000*10=$<<25000*10=250000>>250,000

                [/INST] Let's solve this step by step:

1. When a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. If there are 100 riders, then 25% of 100 riders = 25 riders can stay upright.

2. Of these riders, 60% are women. So, 60% of 25 riders = 15 women can stay upright.

3. Since the total number of upright riders is 25, and 15 of them are women, then the number of men who can stay upright = Total upright riders - Upright women = 25 - 15 = 10.

From the problem, we know that the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell. And we are given that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000. So, we can write the price of a gold Jewell as:

G = (4/5) * $2000

Now, let's calculate the price of a gold Jewell:

G = (4/5) * $2000 = $1600

Next, we are told that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell. So, we can write the price of a silver Jewell as:

S = G - $400

Now, let's calculate the price of a silver Jewell:

S = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Finally, we are asked to find the total price for all three jewels. So, we add the prices of a diamond Jewell, a gold Jewell, and a silver Jewell:

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200

Now, let's calculate the total price:

Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add up all the stamps from each design:

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob. This will happen when the distance between them becomes zero.

1. First, let's find the speed difference between Tom and Bob. Tom is driving at 70 mph and Bob is driving at 55 mph, so the speed difference is 70 - 55 = 15 mph.

2. This speed difference means that Tom is closing the gap between them by 15 miles every hour.

3. We know that initially, Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.

4. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed: Time = Distance / Speed

5. So, Time = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours.

Final answer: \boxed{5} hours</s>","Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour to Bob's 55 miles per hour, meaning Tom is gaining at a rate of 70 mph - 55 mph = <<70-55=15>>15 mph.

1. First, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class that Manny's parents are willing to pay, which is $10 per class.

2. Next, we need to determine the maximum amount of money Manny's parents are willing to spend on his Karate classes, which is 10 times the maximum cost per class (since there are 10 total classes). So, they are willing to spend $10 * 10 = $100.

3. Now, let's assume that Manny misses X classes. The cost of the remaining (10 - X) classes will be less than or equal to $100. Since each class costs $60, we can write this as: (10 - X) * $60 <= $100.

1. First, we know that Julie processes customers at the same rate as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers per day. So, Julie also processes 50 customers per day.

2. The number of days they work in a week is not specified, but usually, it's assumed to be 5 days a week. So, let's assume they work 5 days a week.

3. Now, we can calculate the total number of customers processed by each of them in a week. For Jewel, that would be 50 customers/day * 5 days/week = 250 customers/week.

4. Since Julie processes customers at the same rate as Jewel, she also processes 250 customers/week.

5. To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add the number of customers processed by each: 250 customers/week (Jewel) + 250 customers/week (Julie) = 500 customers/week.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to find the cost of one apple. We know that four apples cost $5.

20. So, to find the cost of one apple, we divide the total cost by the number of apples.

Cost of one apple = Total cost of apples / Number of apples
   Cost of one apple = $5.20 / 4
   Cost of one apple = $1.30

2. Next, we need to find the cost of one orange. We know that three oranges cost $3.30. So, to find the cost of one orange, we divide the total cost by the number of oranges.

Cost of one orange = Total cost of oranges / Number of oranges
   Cost of one orange = $3.30 / 3
   Cost of one orange = $1.10

3. Now, we know the cost of one apple and one orange. The question asks for the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges. So, we multiply the cost of one apple and one orange by 5 respectively and then add them together.

Total cost = (Cost of one apple * Number of apples) + (Cost of one orange * Number of oranges)
   Total cost = ($1.30 * 5) + ($1.10 * 5)
   Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50
   Total cost = $12.00

So, Clyde will pay $\boxed{\$12.00}$ for 5 apples and 5 oranges.</s>","Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem into simpler steps.

1. First, let's calculate the volume of the hole Bob wants to dig. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. In this case, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the depth is 3 feet. So, the volume of the hole is 6 * 4 * 3 = 72 cubic feet.

2. Next, let's consider the rate at which Bob can dig. He can dig a cubic 3/4 foot of earth in 3 seconds. This is equivalent to digging a 1 cubic foot of earth in 4 seconds (since 3/4 is 3/4 of a cubic foot and we need a full cubic foot for our problem).

3. Now, we can calculate the time it will take Bob to dig the hole. If the volume of the hole is 72 cubic feet and Bob can dig 1 cubic foot in 4 seconds, then it will take him 72 * 4 = 288 seconds to dig the hole.

So, the final answer is {288 seconds}.</s>","The hole is 6 feet long by 4 feet wide by 3 feet deep or 6 * 4 * 3 = <<6*4*3=72>>72 cubic feet.

1. Original base price of the truck: $30,000
2. Cost of the king cab upgrade: $7,500
   - This is stated as an extra cost
3. Cost of leather seats: one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
   - Leather seats cost = (1/3) * $7,500 = $2,500
4. Cost of running boards: $500 less than the leather seats
   - Running boards cost = $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. Cost of the upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, we add all these costs together:

Total cost = Base price + King cab upgrade + Leather seats + Running boards + Upgraded exterior light package
Total cost = $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500

                    Tim gets , a promotion that offers him a 5% raise ? on ! his $20000 a , month salary.  It also gives ? him a , bonus worth half a : month's salary. . How much money will he make ; in . a , year?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Calculate Tim's monthly salary after the 5% raise**: Tim's current monthly salary is $20,

000. A 5% raise on this amount would be calculated as follows:
   - 5% of $20,000 = (5/100) * $20,000 = $1,000
   - So, after the raise, Tim's salary would be $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

2. **Calculate the bonus**: The bonus is worth half a month's salary. Since Tim's new monthly salary is $21,000, half of this would be:
   - Half of $21,000 = $21,000 / 2 = $10,500

3. **Calculate annual income from salary**: To find out how much Tim will make in a year from his salary, we multiply his monthly salary by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
   - $21,000 * 12 = $252,000

4. **Calculate annual income from bonus**: The bonus is a one-time additional income, so we add it to his annual salary income:
   - $252,000 (from salary) + $10,500 (from bonus) = $262,500

So, the final answer, showing Tim's total annual income after the promotion and including the bonus, is {The final answer is $262,500}.</s>","The promotion increased his monthly salary by 20000*.05=$<<20000*0.05=1000>>1000
So his new salary is 20000+1000=$<<20000+1000=21000>>21000 a month
So he makes 21000*12=$<<21000*12=252000>>252,000 a year
The bonus is worth 21000*.5=$<<21000*.5=10500>>10500
So he makes 252,000+10,500=$<<252000+10500=262500>>262,500 for the year

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we'll break it down into smaller, manageable steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the suits**: James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $

750. Therefore, the total cost for the suits is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of suits} = \$750 \times 10 = \$7500.
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of one dress pant**: It's given that the dress pants cost $\frac{1}{5}$ of the cost of one suit. Since one suit costs $750, the cost of one dress pant is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one dress pant} = \$750 \times \frac{1}{5} = \$150.
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the dress pants**: James buys 10 dress pants, and each pant costs $150. Therefore, the total cost for the dress pants is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of dress pants} = \$150 \times 10 = \$1500.
   \]

4. **Find the total number of dress shirts bought**: James buys 3 dress shirts for each suit. Since he buys 10 suits, the total number of dress shirts bought is:
   \[
   \text{Total dress shirts} = 3 \times 10 = 30.
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the dress shirts**: The dress shirts cost $60 each. Therefore, the total cost for the dress shirts is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of dress shirts} = \$60 \times 30 = \$1800.
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost of everything**: To find the total cost, we add the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$7500 + \$1500 + \$1800 = \$10800.
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything James bought is $\boxed{\$10800}$.</s>","The suits cost 750*10=$<<750*10=7500>>7500
The dress pants cost 750/5=$<<750/5=150>>150 each
So in total they cost 150*10=$<<150*10=1500>>1500
He bought 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 dress shirts
so he spends 30*60=$<<30*60=1800>>1800 on dress shirts
Thus the total cost is 7500+1500+1800=$<<7500+1500+1800=10800>>10,800

1. The news website publishes 20 articles per day.
2. February typically has 28 days.
3. So, the total number of articles published by the news website in February can be calculated as follows: Total articles by news website = Articles per day * Number of days = 20 articles per day * 28 days = 560 articles

Next, let's calculate the total number of articles published by the sister company in February.

1. The sister company publishes 10 articles per day.
2. February typically has 28 days.
3. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February can be calculated as follows: Total articles by sister company = Articles per day * Number of days = 10 articles per day * 28 days = 280 articles

Finally, let's calculate the total number of articles published by both companies in February.

1. The total number of articles published by both companies in February would be the sum of the articles published by each company.
2. So, the total number of articles published by both companies in February can be calculated as follows: Total articles by both companies = Total articles by news website + Total articles by sister company = 560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

Therefore, the two websites published a total of \boxed{840} articles in February.</s>","In February, with 28 days, the political and weather publishing news website produced a total of 28*20=<<28*20=560>>560 articles.

1. First, we know that Steve is 60 years old.
2. Next, we know that his wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is currently half as old as his mom, so their son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Lastly, their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, but we don't know the son's wife's age yet.

To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to know the age of the son's wife's husband. Since we only have the son's age and the information about the son's wife's age related to her husband's, we cannot determine the son's wife's age with the given information.

The question asks for the amount of flour in three bags before they were divided into portions. Since we know that each bag contains 16 kilograms of flour, we can calculate the total amount of flour in three bags by multiplying 16 (kilograms per bag) by 3 (number of bags).

So, 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms of flour.

Therefore, before it was divided into portions, there was \boxed{48} kilograms of flour in three bags.</s>","A bag of flour has 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 kilograms.

Distance for Alisa = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours
Distance for Alisa = 54 miles

For Stanley:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance for Stanley = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours
Distance for Stanley = 25 miles

Now, to find the total distance traveled by both Alisa and Stanley:

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. So, the total cost without the voucher would be 20 (pomegranates) * $20 (price per pomegranate) = $400. But she got $2 off because of her voucher, so the final price she paid is $400 - $2 = $398.

2. On the next day, the price increased to $30 per pomegranate. Since she bought the same amount of pomegranates (20), the total cost would be 20 * $30 = $600.

3. But she took advantage of the 10% discount. So, the total cost after the discount would be $600 - ($600 * 0.10) = $600 - $60 = $540.

4. Finally, to find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we subtract the price on Tuesday from the price on the next day: $540 - $398 = $142.

So, {The final answer is} $142.</s>","On Tuesday, the pomegranates cost Clara 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranates = $<<20*20=400>>400

Next, let's find out her total sales in the first month:
$400 (sales from red hats) + $200 (sales from green hats) = $600 (total sales in the first month)

Now, let's calculate how much she made in the second month, which was 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:

Finally, let's add up her total sales for both months:

                [/INST] To break down the problem and calculate the total cost, we can follow these steps:

1. The total time James hired the carriage is from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a duration of 4 hours.

2. However, since he gets 1 hour free, we need to subtract this hour from the total time to find out how long he paid for. So, the time he paid for is 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours.

3. The first paid hour costs $15, and each hour after that is twice the cost of the first paid hour. So, the cost for the remaining 2 hours (since he paid only for 3 hours in total) is 2 * $15 = $30.

4. Therefore, the total cost for the 3 hours is the cost for the first paid hour plus the cost for the next 2 hours, which is $15 + $30 = $45.

3 deviled egg halves/guest * 16 guests = 48 deviled egg halves

Next, we know that Lori needed 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves. So, to make 48 deviled egg halves, she would need:
48 deviled egg halves * 1 whole egg / 2 deviled egg halves = 24 whole eggs

Finally, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens

So, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party. {The final answer is} 2 dozens.</s>","She is inviting 16 guests that will eat 3 deviled egg halves each so she needs 16*3 =<<16*3=48>>48 halves

2. To find out how many pages Sheila has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages. This can be represented as X - 1/3 * X.

3. Simplifying the expression X - 1/3 * X gives us 2/3 * X.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. **Cost of the Plane**: The plane cost James $150,000.

2. **Rent for the Hanger**: James pays $5,000 a month to rent a hangar.

3. **Cost of Fuel**: He spends twice as much on fuel as he does on the hangar rent, which means he spends $5,000 * 2 = $10,000 on fuel each month.

4. **Total Monthly Cost**: The total cost per month is the cost of the plane (divided by the number of months in a year, if it was the initial cost) + the rent of the hanger + the cost of fuel. However, since the cost of the plane is a one-time expense, we only consider it once for the first year. So, the total monthly cost is $5,000 (hangar rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

5. **Annual Cost**: To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the total monthly cost by the number of months in a year, which is 12. So, the annual cost is $15,000/month * 12 months = $180,000.

However, we have to remember that the initial cost of the plane is a one-time expense. So, the final cost is $150,000 (plane cost) + $180,000 (annual maintenance) = $330,000.

Therefore, the final answer is that it cost James $330,000 to get and maintain the plane for the first year. {The final answer is $330,000}</s>","The fuel cost 5000*2=$<<5000*2=10000>>10000 per month

1. Finley bought rice, beans, and pork to use in their home.
2. It took her 30 minutes to cook rice.
3. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, the time to cook pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.
4. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, first, we need to find the combined cooking time of pork and rice, which is 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) = 80 minutes. Then, the cooking time for beans is half of this, which is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.
5. Now, to find out how long it took to cook all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans. So, the total time is 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

1. Cost of a pound of almonds = $10
2. Cost of a pound of walnuts = $15

Mixture 1: 1/2 pound of almonds + 1/3 pound of walnuts
- 1/2 pound of almonds costs = (1/2) * $10 = $5
- 1/3 pound of walnuts costs = (1/3) * $15 = $5
- Total cost of Mixture 1 = $5 + $5 = $10

Mixture 2: 1/5 pound of almonds + 1/3 pound of walnuts
- 1/5 pound of almonds costs = (1/5) * $10 = $2
- 1/3 pound of walnuts costs = (1/3) * $15 = $5
- Total cost of Mixture 2 = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.

Difference = Cost of Mixture 1 - Cost of Mixture 2
- Difference = $10 - $7 = $3

{The final answer is} $3.</s>","One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
One-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.

So, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $5 + $5 = $10.
And 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $2 + $5 = $7.

                [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We know that sheep have 4 legs each and geese have 2 legs each. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

2. The total number of animal legs is given as

70. So, we can write the equation: 4S + 2G = 70.

3. The total number of animal heads is given as

20. Since each animal has one head, whether it's a sheep or a goose, we can also write the equation: S + G = 20.

4. Now we have a system of two equations:
   - 4S + 2G = 70
   - S + G = 20

5. We can solve this system of equations in several ways. One way is to solve the second equation for G and substitute it into the first equation. Solving S + G = 20 for G gives G = 20 - S.

6. Substituting G = 20 - S into the first equation gives: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

7. Simplifying this equation gives: 4S + 40 - 2S = 70, which further simplifies to 2S = 30.

8. Solving for S gives S = 15.

9. Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

\boxed{15}</s>","Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.
Therefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.
The animals have 2g + 4s = 70 legs.
Using the value of s above, 2g + 4(20-g) = 70.
2g + 80 - 4g = 70.
2g = 10.
There are therefore 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 geese.
There are 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 sheep remaining on the farm.

If , the ; rest of the teachers on the : court are math teachers, and each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, calculate the total time the math : teachers , collectively spend sleeping in one ! day.
                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know there are 150 teachers in total.
2. We are told that 60% of these teachers are history teachers. So, the number of history teachers is 60% of 150. In mathematical terms, this is 0.6 * 150 = 90 teachers.
3. The rest of the teachers are math teachers. So, the number of math teachers is the total number of teachers minus the number of history teachers. That is, 150 - 90 = 60 teachers.
4. Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. So, the total time the math teachers spend sleeping is the number of math teachers times the number of hours they sleep per day.
5. Therefore, the total time the math teachers spend sleeping is 60 teachers * 6 hours = 360 hours.

So, the final answer is {The math teachers spend a total of 360 hours sleeping in one day}.</s>","The total number of teachers in the basketball court who teaches history is 60/100*150 = <<60/100*150=90>>90
This means there are 150-90 = <<150-90=60>>60 math teachers are on the basketball court.
If each teacher sleeps for 6 hours daily, the total amount of time the math teachers sleep in a day is 60*6 = <<60*6=360>>360 hours.

                [/INST] First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. If Aurelia has $120 and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, then:

Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
= 3/4 * $120
= $90

Next, let's find out how much money Rayna has. If Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, then:

Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
= $90 + $60
= $150

Now, let's find out how much money all three of them have together.

Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
= $120 + $90 + $150
= $360

If they decide to add their money together and share it equally among them, then each person would get:

Money per person = Total money / Number of people
= $360 / 3
= $120

So, if they decided to add their money together and share equally among them, each person would have $120.

{The final answer is: $120}</s>","Since Arelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money Arelia, Kassidy has 3/4*$120 = $<<3/4*120=90>>90
The total amount of, money Kassidy and Arelia have together is $90+$120 = $<<90+120=210>>210
Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, and since Kassidy has $90, Rayna has $60+$90 = $<<60+90=150>>150
The three of them together has $210+$150 = $<<210+150=360>>360
If they decide to add up their money and share equally, each person would receive $360/3= $<<360/3=120>>120

\[4 \times 12 = 48\, \text{minutes}\]

2. Next, we add the extra minutes from the extended game. The game was extended for an additional 5 minutes. So, we add these minutes to the total duration of the regular quarters:
\[48 + 5 = 53\, \text{minutes}\]

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes.

Management employees = Total employees * Percentage of management employees
   = 50 * 0.20
   = 10

2. Next, we calculate how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. We multiply the number of management employees (10) by 0.30 (which represents 30%).

First, let's find out the cost of all the candies Adam bought.

Cost of candies of type A = Number of candies of type A * Cost of one candy of type A
Cost of candies of type A = 7 * $0.5 = $\boxed{3.5}

Similarly,

Cost of candies of type B = Number of candies of type B * Cost of one candy of type B
Cost of candies of type B = 10 * $0.75 = $\boxed{7.5}

The total cost of all the candies Adam bought is the sum of the cost of candies of type A and type B.

Total cost = Cost of candies of type A + Cost of candies of type B
Total cost = $3.5 + $7.5 = $\boxed{11.0}

Now, to find out how much change Adam received, we need to subtract the total cost of the candies from the amount he paid.

Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $15 - $11.0 = $\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 4.0}</s>","For type A candies Adam needed to pay 7 * 0.5 = $<<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5.

                [/INST] First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the bamboo grows in inches, let's convert the current height of the bamboo to inches. We know that 1 inch is equal to 0.08333 feet, so:

Current height = 20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, so we can set up a simple equation to find out how many days it will take to reach 600 inches in height:

growth = final height - initial height

days * growth rate = final height - initial height

days * 30 = 600 - 240

days = (600 - 240) / 30

days = 360 / 30

days = 12

{The final answer is 12 days.}</s>","Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.
So, the bamboo needs to grow 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 inches more.

                [/INST] The final answer is 36.

Here's the breakdown:

At the moment, Jennifer has 44 signatures and Carol has 20. Together, they have 44 + 20 = 64 signatures.

They want to reach a total of 100 signatures. So, they still need 100 - 64 = 36 signatures.

They have three more weeks to collect these signatures. Since they do this every afternoon during their summer break, let's assume they collect the same number of signatures each day.

They've been doing this for 5 weeks already. So, if we divide the total number of weeks they have left by the total number of weeks they've already spent, we can find out how much they collect each week: 3 weeks / 5 weeks = 3/5

So, they need to collect 3/5 * 64 = 38.4 signatures per week, which they can't do exactly. Since they can't collect a fraction of a signature, they'll need to round up to 39 signatures per week to meet or exceed their goal for the last three weeks.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we know that Lorie earns $10 per hour.
2. Karen earns twice what Lorie earns. So, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.
3. Karen works 3 hours per day. So, in one day, she earns 3 hours * $20/hour = $60.

                [/INST] To find out how many hash browns you can make from 96 potatoes, you first need to determine how many hash browns one potato can make.

Step 1: Identify the ratio of hash browns to potatoes.
From the problem, we know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. This gives us a ratio of hash browns to potatoes.

Step 2: Simplify the ratio.
To simplify the ratio, divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor. In this case, the greatest common divisor of 6 and 36 is 6. So, the simplified ratio is 6 hash browns to 1 potato.

Step 3: Determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.
Now that we know the ratio is 6 hash browns to 1 potato, we can determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.

Step 4: Multiply the number of potatoes by the number of hash browns that can be made from one potato.
The calculation is 96 potatoes * 6 hash browns/potato = 576 hash browns

So, you can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes.

{The final answer is: 576 hash browns}</s>","First find the number of hash browns per potato: 36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = <<36/6=6>>6 hash browns/potato

1. First, let's calculate the total weight of the 9 adults (Jack and the 8 other adults). Since an adult weighs an average of 80 kg, the total weight of the 9 adults is:
   Total weight = Number of adults * Weight of each adult
   Total weight = 9 * 80 kg
   Total weight = 720 kg

2. Next, we need to compare this total weight with the maximum load limit of the elevator, which is 700 kg.

3. The difference between the total weight of the 9 adults and the maximum load limit gives us by how much they have exceeded the maximum load:
   Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load limit
   Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
   Excess weight = 20 kg

{The final answer is: They have exceeded the maximum load by 20 kg.}</s>","Jack and 8 other adults form a total of 8 adults + 1 adult = <<8+1=9>>9 adults.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. Since Katarina has 68 cookies, we can find out the number of cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies. So, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, we can find out the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies. The Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

4. To find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each person has. So, the total is 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298 cookies.

                [/INST] To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final design. We know that the final design is 140 cm long, which includes the original dress plus an additional 50% of its original length and 20 cm of lace trim.

1. First, let's subtract the additional 50% of the original length. Since the additional length is equal to 50% of the original length, we can represent it as 0.5 times the original length (x). So, we have:
   140 cm = (original length + 0.5x) + 20 cm

2. Subtracting 20 cm from both sides of the equation, we get:
   140 cm - 20 cm = original length + 0.5x
   120 cm = original length + 0.5x

3. Now, let's find the value of x:
   120 cm - original length = 0.5x

4. Since we don't know the original length yet, we can represent it as 'L':
   120 cm - L = 0.5 * L

5. Adding 'L' to both sides of the equation, we get:
   1.5 * L = 120 cm

6. Finally, dividing both sides by 1.5, we find the original length:
   L = 120 cm / 1.5
   L = 80 cm

So, the original design of Shania's dress was 80 cm long. {The final answer is} 80 cm.</s>","Without the lace trim, the dress is 140cm full length – 20cm lace trim = <<140-20=120>>120cm.

Adding the original length and the extended length, which is x+x/2 = 120

1. First, we need to understand that Chris can mow his entire lawn in 1 hour in turtle mode and in 40 minutes in rabbit mode.

2. In turtle mode, it takes him 1 hour to mow the entire lawn. So, half of the lawn would take half the time. Half of 1 hour is 0.5 hours. Since we want the time in minutes, we convert 0.5 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60 (the number of minutes in an hour). So, 0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes.

3. In rabbit mode, it takes him 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn. So, half of the lawn would take half the time. Half of 40 minutes is 20 minutes.

4. The total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is the time it took him to mow half in turtle mode plus the time it took him to mow half in rabbit mode. So, 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

                [/INST] Let's reason through this problem step by step:

1. We know there is one set of twins and one set of triplets.
2. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
3. Their combined ages are 44.
4. Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7 (since the older twin is 7 years older than the younger twin), and the age of the triplet as Y.
5. From the problem, we know that the sum of their ages is 44. So, we can write the equation: T + (T+7) + 3Y = 44 (Since there are three triplets, we multiply Y by 3).
6. Simplifying the equation gives us: 2T + 7 + 3Y = 44.
7. We don't know the exact age of the triplet, but we know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. This means that the younger twin, T, is 7 years younger than one triplet, Y. So, we can write another equation: T = Y - 7.
8. Substituting T from the second equation into the first equation gives us: 2(Y - 7) + 7 + 3Y = 44.
9. Simplifying and solving for Y gives us Y = 8.
10. Substituting Y = 8 back into T = Y - 7 gives us T = 1.

{The final answer is: One of the twins is 1 year old.}</s>","Let T = age of triplet
Twin's age = T + <<+7=7>>7
Twin's combined age = 2 * (T + 7)
Triplet's combined age = <<3=3>>3T

2T + 14 + 3T = 44

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Adding these up gives us a total of:
20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes of homework.

Step 2: Calculate remaining time
- Total time before dinner: 3 hours
- Convert hours to minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes) gives us 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

                [/INST] First, let's break down the initial problem into smaller parts.

- The cost of one lollipop is $0.40.
- Manolo bought 5 lollipops, so the total cost for the lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.
- The cost of 4 candies is $3.20. Since candies are not as accurately quantified as lollipops, let's assign each candy a cost of X dollars, so the total cost for the candies is 4X = $3.20.

Next, let's solve for X:

- 4X = $3.20
- X = $3.20 / 4
- X = $0.80 per candy

Now, let's look at the second part of the problem:

- Manolo wants to buy 10 lollipops and 10 candies.
- The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.
- The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.80 = $8.00.
- The total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00.

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00.

The final answer is: {The final answer is $12.00}</s>","Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.
So four candies cost $3.20 - $2 = $1.20.
Thus, each candy costs $1.20/4 = $<<1.20/4=0.30>>0.30.
Ten lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.
Ten candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.
Hence, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4 + $3 = $7.

1. Rong is saving 20 coins every month.
2. Neil is saving 2/5 times more than Rong.

To find out how many coins Neil is saving each month, we calculate 2/5 of 20:

2/5 * 20 = 8 coins

So, Neil is saving 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate the total savings for both Rong and Neil after 10 years.

We know there are 12 months in a year, so in 10 years, there would be 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Rong's total savings over 10 years would be:

20 coins/month * 120 months = 2400 coins

28 coins/month * 120 months = 3360 coins

Therefore, ten years after they started their savings, Rong will have 2400 coins, and Neil will have 3360 coins.

{The final answer is: Rong has 2400 coins, and Neil has 3360 coins.}</s>","Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong, a total of 2/5*20 = <<2/5*20=8>>8 more coins.
The total number of coins that Neil has been saving in his piggy month per month is 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 coins.
If Rong has been saving 20 coins every month for ten years, the total number of months he's been saving for is 12*10 = <<12*10=120>>120 months.
Saving 20 coins every month for ten years, Rong has 20*120 = <<20*120=2400>>2400 coins in his piggy bank.
If Neil has also been saving for ten years, he has saved 120*28 = <<120*28=3360>>3360 coins in his piggy bank.

                    John brings . his dog to the vet. His dog needs ; 2 vaccines, which are $20 each, and a ; heartworm ! check. ? The ? heartworm check . is ; 60% of . his ; total bill. , If he brought $125 with him, how much ? does he leave with?
                [/INST] First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. The dog needs two vaccines, which are $20 each. So, the total cost for vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The total bill is the cost of the vaccines plus the cost of the heartworm check. Let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as H. So, the total bill is $40 + H.

According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. So, we can write this as H = 0.6 * ($40 + H).

Now, let's solve this equation for H.

H = 0.6 * ($40 + H)
H = 0.6 * $40 + 0.6 * H
H - 0.6 * H = 0.6 * $40
0.4 * H = 0.6 * $40
H = (0.6 * $40) / 0.4
H = $24

So, the cost of the heartworm check is $24.

The total bill is $40 (vaccines) + $24 (heartworm check) = $64.

John brought $125 with him. After paying for the total bill, he leaves with $125 - $64 = $61.

The final answer is John leaves with $61.</s>","The vaccines cost 40 because 2 x 20 = <<2*20=40>>40
The vaccines are 40% of his total bill because 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40
The total bill is $100 because 40 / .4 = <<40/.4=100>>100
He leaves with $25 because 125 - 100 = <<125-100=25>>25

Oranges are the most expensive ; and cost three times as much as ? a banana per piece. What would be the ? price for ; such a crate , of fruit?
                [/INST] Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find the cost of one banana. Given that one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much, we can calculate the cost of one banana as follows: 0.5 * 2 = $1.

2. Next, we need to find the cost of one orange. Since oranges cost three times as much as a banana per piece, we can calculate their cost as follows: 1 * 3 = $3.

3. Now, we can calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate. The crate contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. So, the total cost would be:
   - Cost of bananas = 5 * $1 = $5
   - Cost of apples = 12 * $0.5 = $6
   - Cost of oranges = 7 * $3 = $21
   Adding these up, we get the total cost of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

So, the final answer is:
{The price for such a crate of fruit would be $32}.</s>","The price for apples in the crate would be 12 * 0.5 = $<<12*0.5=6>>6.
Cost of banana is 0.5 * 2 = $<<0.5*2=1>>1.
So the bananas in this crate cost 5 * 1 = $<<5*1=5>>5.
One orange is three times more expensive than a banana, so it costs 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.
So for the oranges in the crate, one needs to pay 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.
So the whole crate costs 6 + 5 + 21 = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.

How ; many square feet is Brittany's comforter?
                [/INST] First, let's determine the number of squares of each color.

1. Brittany's quilted comforter has 14 red squares.
2. The comforter had 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.
3. The comforter had 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.
4. The comforter had 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, let's find out the total number of squares on Brittany's comforter.

The total number of squares is the sum of the number of red, blue, green, and white squares.

Total number of squares = Red squares + Blue squares + Green squares + White squares
= 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
= 68 squares

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the area of each square is 1 square foot. Therefore, the total area of Brittany's comforter in square feet is equal to the total number of squares.

So, \boxed{68} square feet is Brittany's comforter.</s>","With 4 more blue than red squares, the comforter has 14+4=<<14+4=18>>18 blue squares.
With 6 more green than blue squares, the comforter has 24 green squares.
With 12 fewer white squares than green squares, the comforter has 12 white squares.
In total, the comforter has 14+18+24+12 = <<14+18+24+12=68>>68 squares that are 1-foot by 1-foot in size.
Since each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, then each square equals one square foot.
Thus, the comforter is 68 square feet.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of chairs needed for 42 adults and 15 babies, and then figure out how many additional chairs Mia needs to get.

1. Calculate the total number of chairs needed for adults: 42 adults * 2 chairs per adult = 84 chairs
2. Calculate the total number of chairs needed for babies: 15 babies * 1 chair per baby = 15 chairs
3. Add the number of chairs for adults and babies to get the total number of necessary chairs: 84 chairs + 15 chairs = 99 chairs
4. Mia has 8 high chairs, which is already provided. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, calculate the number of additional regular chairs needed from the total number of chairs: 99 chairs - 8 high chairs - 5x high chairs = 99 - 8 - 40 = 51 chairs
5. Since Mia has 8 high chairs, the required number of additional regular chairs is 51 chairs - 8 high chairs = 43 chairs
6. Add the 43 additional regular chairs to the 8 high chairs to find the final number of chairs needed: 43 additional chairs + 8 high chairs = 51 chairs

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, which is 50 + (0.3 * 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.
3. Since Tom has 30 points less than Betty, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, which is 3 * 35 = 105 points.
5. Now, let's add up the points collected by all four students: Adam (50), Betty (65), Tom (35), and Marta (105) = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.
6. The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. So, the class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip.

Therefore, the class is missing $\boxed{145}$  points to reach the threshold for the trip.</s>","Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.

   Total fireworks = Number of boxes * Fireworks per box
   = 15 * 20
   = 300 fireworks

2. She is going to see 40% of the city's fireworks. First, we need to find out how many fireworks are in the city. Since the city is having a big display of fireworks, let's assume they are using the same number of fireworks as Hannah (300 fireworks), but we don't know for sure.

3. Her house is positioned at the right angle to see the fireworks. This means she can see 40% of the city's fireworks:

   Since each person needs a seat, the total number of seats required is equal to the number of people in the group. Therefore, the total number of seats is:
   20 seats {The final answer is: Total seats = 20}

3. Calculate the total number of drinks required:
   Each person has 2 drinks, so the total number of drinks required is:
   Total drinks = Total people * Drinks per person = 20 * 2 = 40 drinks {The final answer is: Total drinks = 40}

4. Calculate the total number of snacks required:
   Each person has 3 snacks, so the total number of snacks required is:
   Total snacks = Total people * Snacks per person = 20 * 3 = 60 snacks {The final answer is: Total snacks = 60}

5. Calculate the total cost of drinks and snacks:
   The cost of each drink and snack is $2. Therefore, the total cost is:
   Total cost = Total drinks * Cost per drink + Total snacks * Cost per snack = 40 * $2 + 60 * $2 = $80 + $120 = $200

Therefore, the group has spent a total of $200 on snacks and drinks. {The final answer is: Total cost = $200}</s>","Including Aiden, the whole group saves 1 + 12 + 7 = <<1+12+7=20>>20 seats.
In total, the seats can hold 2 drinks * 20 seats = <<2*20=40>>40 drinks.
In total, the seats can hold 3 snacks * 20 seats = <<3*20=60>>60 snacks.
So in total, the group buys 40 drinks + 60 snacks = <<40+60=100>>100 items.
As snacks and drinks cost $2 each, the group has spent 100 items * $2 = $<<100*2=200>>200 overall.

1. We know that there are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females.

2. Each female ate 3 dumplings. So, the total dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.

3. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

4. So, the total dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.

5. The total dumplings eaten by both males and females is 18 (females) + 32 (males) = 50 dumplings.

6. However, we are told that there were no leftovers. So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked was 50.

Therefore, \boxed{50} dumplings did Larry cook.</s>","So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.
Hence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Gerald and Julia had initially according to the given ratio. The total parts in the ratio are 3 (for Gerald) + 2 (for Julia) = 5 parts. Each part is worth of $100 / 5 = $20.

Step 3: Determine how much money Gerald had initially. According to the ratio, Gerald had 3 parts, which is equivalent to 3 * $20 = $60.

Step 4: Subtract the amount of money Gerald spent from his initial amount. Gerald spent $10, so the subtraction would be $60 - $10 = $50.

1. The city in Colorado uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. Out of this 40% used by the city, 80% is used for industrial purposes.

So, we need to find out what percent of the river's total water is used for non-industrial purposes by the city.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water used by the city for industrial purposes

The city uses 40% of the river's water, out of which 80% is used for industrial purposes. So, the amount of the river's total water used for industrial purposes by the city is:

40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes

The city also uses some of its 40% of the river's water for non-industrial purposes. Since it uses 32% for industrial purposes, the amount used for non-industrial purposes is:

40% - 32% = 0.4 - 0.32 = 0.08 or 8%

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

1. We know that Alex charges $12 per hour for tutoring.
2. We also know that she provides tutoring for 2 weeks, and there are 7 days in a week.
3. Therefore, if we multiply the number of weeks by the number of days in a week, we get the total number of days Alex will be tutoring.
   So, 2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days.
4. To find out the total cost of 2 weeks of tutoring, we multiply the number of days by the cost per day.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the factory produces each type of ice cream and then use those rates to find out how much ice cream is produced in 48 hours.

First, let's find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate ice cream. The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the rate, we divide the amount of chocolate ice cream made by the time it takes to make it:

Rate of chocolate ice cream = 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour

Next, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes vanilla ice cream. The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the rate, we divide the amount of vanilla ice cream made by the time it takes to make it:

Rate of vanilla ice cream = 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour

Now that we have the rates, we can calculate how much ice cream the factory produces in 48 hours. We'll do this separately for each type of ice cream and then add the amounts together.

For chocolate ice cream:
In 48 hours, the factory would make 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts

For vanilla ice cream:
In 48 hours, the factory would make 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Now, we add the amounts of both types of ice cream together to find the total amount produced in 48 hours:

Total amount = 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts

Therefore, the factory would make a total of 3000 quarts of ice cream in 48 hours.

The final answer is {The factory would make a total of 3000 quarts of ice cream in 48 hours}.</s>","Chocolate ice cream can be made at 100 quarts / 2 hours = <<100/2=50>>50 quarts per hour.
Vanilla ice cream can be made at 50 quarts / 4 hours = <<50/4=12.5>>12.5 quarts per hour.
In 48 hours there would be 48 * 50 quarts = <<48*50=2400>>2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.
In 48 hours there would be 48 * 12.5 quarts = <<48*12.5=600>>600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.
Combined there would be 2400 chocolate + 600 vanilla = <<2400+600=3000>>3000 quarts of ice cream.

**Step 2:** Calculate how many deals (sets of 2 scoops for the price of 1) Erin can buy with her money.

Each deal costs $1.50 (2 scoops at $1.50 each), so the number of deals she can buy is:
\[ \frac{$6.00}{$1.50} = 4 \]

**Step 3:** Calculate the total number of scoops Erin gets with her purchases.

Since each deal includes 3 scoops (2 scoops paid for + 1 scoop free), the total number of scoops Erin gets is:

1. Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day.

2. After one day, Ginger has eaten 4 pieces and Amy has eaten 3 pieces. That's a total of 7 pieces eaten by both of them.

3. They started with 100 pieces each, so after one day, they have 93 pieces left in total (100 - 7).

4. Now, we need to find out how much candy each of them has eaten after a week (7 days) and two weeks (14 days), since a fortnight is 14 days.

5. In a week, Ginger eats 4 * 7 = 28 pieces and Amy eats 3 * 7 = 21 pieces. After one week, they have eaten a total of 49 pieces (28 + 21).

6. After one week, they have (100 - 49) = 51 pieces left in total.

7. In the second week, Ginger eats another 28 pieces and Amy eats another 21 pieces. After two weeks, they have eaten a total of 505 pieces (49 + 28*2 + 21*2).

8. After two weeks, they have (100 - 505) = -405 pieces left in total. What? This doesn't make sense.

9. It seems like there's a mistake in the question. They can't eat more pieces than they have. Let's re-calculate:

10. After one day, Ginger has 96 pieces and Amy has 97 pieces.

11. In a week, Ginger eats 28 pieces and Amy eats 21 pieces. After one week, Ginger has 73 pieces and Amy has 76 pieces left.

12. In the second week, Ginger eats another 28 pieces and Amy eats another 21 pieces. After two weeks, Ginger has 37 pieces and Amy has 35 pieces left.

13. Therefore, Amy has only 35 pieces left after two weeks, and Ginger has more. The question seems to be asking for the amount Ginger has more than Amy, not the other way around.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many square feet Mr. Boarden wants to cover with tiles. He wants to cover two thirds of his bathroom, which is 36 square feet. So, the area to be covered is (2/3)*36 = 24 square feet.

2. Next, we need to determine how many mosaic tiles are needed for each square foot. According to the question, for every square foot, 24 mosaic tiles are needed.

3. Therefore, the total number of mosaic tiles needed to cover 24 square feet is 24 tiles/square foot * 24 square feet = 576 tiles.

So, the final answer is {The final answer is 576 tiles}.</s>","A third of Mr. Boarden's bathroom is 36/3 = <<36/3=12>>12 sqft
Two thirds of Mr. Boarden's bathroom is 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 sq ft
Mr. Boarden needs 24 x 24 = <<24*24=576>>576 mosaic tiles

                [/INST] First, let's calculate how much James spent on picking the blueberries. The cost of picking is $20 and the cost per pound is $1.5. He picked 30 pounds of blueberries. So, the total cost of picking is $20 (cost of picking) + $1.5 * 30 (cost of blueberries) = $20 + $45 = $65.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store. The cost per pound at the store is $2.5. So, the total cost of buying is $2.5 * 30 = $75.

Finally, let's calculate how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself. He spent $65 on picking and the cost of buying is $75. So, he saved $75 (cost of buying) - $65 (cost of picking) = $10.

So, the final answer is {James saved $10}.</s>","He paid 30*1.5=$<<30*1.5=45>>45 for the blueberries he picked
So after the entrance fee it was 45+20=$<<45+20=65>>65

Calculate the total ; amount , of money they paid . to buy the computers at the new prices.
                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into clear, logical steps:

1. The company initially planned to buy 500 computers for $700 each. So, the initial total cost was:
   Initial total cost = Number of computers * Price per computer
   = 500 * $700
   = $350,000

2. However, the price of each computer was 10% higher than they had planned. So, the actual price per computer is:
   Actual price per computer = Initial price per computer + (10% of Initial price per computer)
   = $700 + (0.10 * $700)
   = $700 + $70
   = $770

3. Now, we can calculate the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices:
   Total amount paid = Number of computers * Actual price per computer
   = 500 * $770
   = $385,000

So, the final answer is:

{The total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000}.</s>","When they went to order, the company realized the prices of each computer had increased by 10/100*700 = $<<10/100*700=70>>70

                [/INST] To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to consider the calories from each ingredient and their respective quantities. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. Calculate the calories from eggs:
   Each egg is 75 calories, and there are 6 eggs in the omelet.
   So, the calories from eggs = 75 calories/egg * 6 eggs = 450 calories.

2. Calculate the calories from cheese:
   Cheese is 120 calories per ounce, and there are 2 ounces of cheese in the omelet.
   So, the calories from cheese = 120 calories/ounce * 2 ounces = 240 calories.

3. Calculate the calories from ham:
   Ham is 40 calories per ounce, and there's an equal amount of ham to cheese, so there's also 2 ounces of ham.
   So, the calories from ham = 40 calories/ounce * 2 ounces = 80 calories.

4. Add up the calories from each ingredient to find the total calories in the omelet:
   Total calories = Calories from eggs + Calories from cheese + Calories from ham
   Total calories = 450 calories + 240 calories + 80 calories = 770 calories.

\boxed{The final answer is 770 calories.}</s>","The eggs contributed 6*75=<<6*75=450>>450 calories

                [/INST] Let's reason through this problem step by step:

1. First, let's define our variables:
   P = price of a pencil ($0.50)
   E = price of an eraser ($0.25)
   N_p = number of pencils bought (6)
   N_e = number of erasers bought (8)
   T = total amount paid ($10)

2. Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers:
   Cost_p = P * N_p = $0.50 * 6 = $3.00
   Cost_e = E * N_e = $0.25 * 8 = $2.00
   Total_cost = Cost_p + Cost_e = $5.00

3. The total cost of the pencils and erasers is $5.00, which is less than the amount paid ($10). Therefore, there is a mistake in the problem as stated: the total amount paid should be equal to the total cost of the pencils and erasers.

4. If we assume you didn't make a mistake, and you paid $10 for pencils and erasers that only cost $5, then you would get the remaining amount as change:
   Change = T - Total_cost = $10 - $5 = $5

In conclusion, if the total cost of the pencils and erasers was indeed $5, then the change you would get would be $5. However, it is more likely that there is a mistake in the problem statement, as the total cost and the amount paid should be equal.

{The final answer is: There is no final answer due to a mistake in the problem statement.}</s>","6 pencils cost 6 x $0.50 = $<<6*0.5=3>>3.
8 erasers cost 8 x $0.25 = $<<8*0.25=2>>2.
Thus, you spent $3 + $2 = $<<3+2=5>>5.
Therefore, you would get $10 - $5 = $<<10-5=5>>5 change.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. First, let's calculate the number of taps when Helga is not raising her arms (i.e., she is tapping at her maximum rate). She taps her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute and her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute. Therefore, the combined rate when her arms are down is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

2. Next, let's calculate the number of taps when Helga is raising her arms (i.e., she is tapping at her reduced rate). Her combined rate when her arms are raised is 200 taps per minute for each foot, so the combined rate is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.

3. Helga dances a total of 5 minutes. She raises her arms for the first 2 minutes, so she taps at her reduced rate for 2 minutes and at her maximum rate for the remaining 3 minutes.

4. To find the total number of taps, we multiply the number of taps per minute by the number of minutes she taps at that rate, and then add the two results together.

When her arms are down, she taps 550 taps/minute for 3 minutes, which is 550 * 3 = 1650 taps.

When her arms are raised, she taps 400 taps/minute for 2 minutes, which is 400 * 2 = 800 taps.

Adding these two results together gives us the total number of taps, which is 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps.

Therefore, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is {The final answer is 2450}.</s>","During the 5 minutes of dancing, 2 minutes were performed with hands raised and 5-2=3 minutes were performed without hands raised.
With hands not raised, her right foot tapped 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 times.
With hands not raised, her left foot tapped 3*250=<<3*250=750>>750 times.
With hands raised, her right foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.
With hands raised, her left foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.
Thus, in total, she tapped 900+750+400+400=<<900+750+400+400=2450>>2450 times

The fine is $120 and each bucket of asphalt costs $25. Ron needs to buy 3 buckets, so the cost of the asphalt is 3 * $25 = $75.

The total cost is then $120 (fine) + $75 (asphalt) = $195.

If the pothole is not fixed, Ron estimates it will cause $450 worth of damage to his car. By fixing the pothole himself for $195, Ron is saving $450 (potential damage) - $195 (fixing cost) = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

1. Bryce and four of his friends each ordered their own pizza. This means there were 5 pizzas in total.

2. Each pizza had 12 slices. So, in total, there were 5 * 12 = 60 slices of pizza.

3. Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since Bryce and two friends each had one pizza, that's 3 pizzas they ate. Therefore, they ate 3 * 12 * 2/3 = 24 slices.

4. The two remaining friends ate 1/4 of their pizzas. Since each of these friends had one pizza, they ate 2 * 12 * 1/4 = 6 slices.

5. To find out how many slices were left, we subtract the slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 24 - 6 = 30 slices.

Therefore, {The final answer is} 30 slices of pizza were left.</s>","Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.

                    question:
                    A cat ! eats nine sausages in 30 ; minutes. A dog can eat the . same ; number , of sausages , in 2/3 : the amount of time the cat , takes. , Calculate the average time the two take the . eat the ! sausages.
                [/INST] Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages.
2. The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time the cat takes.
3. So, the time taken by the dog = (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.
4. Now, we need to find the average time both of them take to eat the same number of sausages.
5. To find the average, we add their respective times and divide by 2.
6. So, the average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2 = (30 + 20) / 2 = 25 minutes.

Therefore, the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

{The final answer is 25 minutes}.</s>","If the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes 2/3*30 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 minutes.
The total amount of time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.
The average time in minutes that the two take to eat the sausages is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

If the length of one of Topher’s shoes is 8-feet ; and 4-inches, how : long, in inches, is one of Bobby’s ! shoes?
                [/INST] First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet to inches since we're given the difference in inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So,

Topher's shoe = 8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches
= 96 inches + 4 inches
= 100 inches

Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. So, we can set up the equation:

100 inches = 9 * (Length of Bobby's shoe) + 10 inches

Now, let's solve for the length of Bobby's shoe:

Length of Bobby's shoe = (100 inches - 10 inches) / 9
= 90 inches / 9
= 10 inches

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

The final answer is \boxed{10}.</s>","Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.
Subtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90
Solving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of student car windows and teacher car windows.

Student car windows = Number of student cars * Number of windows per car
= 64 * 4 = 256

Teacher car windows = Number of teacher cars * Number of windows per car
= 32 * 2 = 64

Hannah smashes a quarter of the student car windows, so the number of student car windows she smashes is:

Student car windows smashed = Quarter of student car windows
= (1/4) * 256 = 64

Hannah smashes 3/4 of the teacher car windows, so the number of teacher car windows she smashes is:

Teacher car windows smashed = (3/4) * 64 = 48

Now, to find the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we add the number of student car windows she smashes to the number of teacher car windows she smashes:

Total windows smashed = Student car windows smashed + Teacher car windows smashed

                [/INST] To find the percentage of blue spools of thread, we first need to determine the total number of blue spools and the total number of all spools.

1. The number of blue spools is the sum of light blue and dark blue spools:
   light blue spools = 15
   dark blue spools = 45
   total blue spools = light blue spools + dark blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

2. The total number of spools of all colors is the sum of light blue, dark blue, light green, and dark green spools:
   light blue spools = 15
   dark blue spools = 45
   light green spools = 40
   dark green spools = 50
   total spools = light blue spools + dark blue spools + light green spools + dark green spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

3. To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100%:

1. At 8:00, the total number of people at the polling station is 5000.
2. By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted. So, the number of people who voted by midday is (2/5)*5000 = 2000.
3. Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.
4. By 16:00 (or 4:00 PM), 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. The number of people who remained after midday (who had not voted) is 3000.
5. So, the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00 is (2/3)*3000 = 2000.
6. Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 3000 (the remaining people after midday) - 2000 (those who voted between midday and 16:00) = 1000.

= 30%

Next, let's add up the percentages of votes obtained by candidates A and B:

Percentage of votes for candidates A and B = 20% + 30% = 50%

Since the total percentage of votes must add up to 100%, the remaining percentage of votes must be for candidate C:

Percentage of votes for candidate C = 100% - 50% = 50%

Finally, to find out how many votes candidate C got, we multiply the total number of voters by the percentage of votes for candidate C:

Number of votes for candidate C = 100 (total voters) * 50 (percentage of votes for C)
= 5000

So, candidate C got 5000 votes.

1. Boris initially has 100 apples.
2. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. So, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.
3. Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.
4. The question asks how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now. So, the difference is 90 (Boris's new number of apples) - 87 (Beck's new number of apples) = 3.

Therefore, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

{The final answer is 3}.</s>","Boris has 100 apples, but gives 10 away, so now he has 100 apples - 10 apples = <<100-10=90>>90 apples.
Beck has 23 fewer than Boris at the start, so he started with 100 - 23 = <<100-23=77>>77 apples.
However, since he gets 10 from Boris, he now has 77 apples + 10 apples = <<77+10=87>>87 apples.
Thus Beck has 90 - 87 = <<90-87=3>>3 apples fewer than Boris.

If he makes 3 giant cubes, . 7 ! medium cubes, ? and 8 : small . cubes, how many ! ounces of water does , he have left?
                [/INST] Let's solve this step by step:

1. Calculate the total amount of water used for giant cubes:
   Peter uses 4 ounces per cube, and he makes 3 giant cubes. So, he uses 4 * 3 = 12 ounces for giant cubes.
   {So far, Peter has used 12 ounces.}

2. Calculate the total amount of water used for medium cubes:
   Peter uses 2 ounces per cube, and he makes 7 medium cubes. So, he uses 2 * 7 = 14 ounces for medium cubes.
   {So far, Peter has used 12 + 14 = 26 ounces.}

3. Calculate the total amount of water used for small cubes:
   Peter uses 1/2 an ounce per cube, and he makes 8 small cubes. So, he uses 0.5 * 8 = 4 ounces for small cubes.
   {So far, Peter has used 26 + 4 = 30 ounces.}

4. Calculate the remaining water:
   Peter started with 32 ounces of water. After making the cubes, he has 32 - 30 = 2 ounces of water left.
   {The final answer is \boxed{2 ounces}}.</s>","The giant cubes used up 12 ounces of water because 3 times 4 equals <<3*4=12>>12.
The medium cubes used up 14 ounces of water because 7 times 2 equals <<7*2=14>>14.
The small cubes used up 4 ounces of water because 8 times 1/2 equals 4.
This means that Peter has used up 30 ounces of water because 12 plus 14 plus 4 equals 30.
Peter has 2 ounces of water left because 32 minus 30 equals <<32-30=2>>2.

                [/INST] The problem asks for the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. We can break this down into two parts: the cost of the gallon jars and the cost of the half-gallon jars.

First, let's find out the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar and costs $5. So, the cost of a half-gallon jar is $5 - $2 = $3.

Next, let's find out the cost of 16 half-gallon jars. The cost of 16 half-gallon jars is 16 * $3 = $48.

Now, let's find out the cost of a 10-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, a 10-gallon jar would cost 10 * $5 = $50.

Finally, let's find out the total amount of money Cecelia spent. This would be the cost of the 10-gallon jars and the cost of the half-gallon jars. The total amount of money Cecelia spent is $50 + $48 = $98.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is: $98}.</s>","If a full gallon costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, then the cost of a half-gallon jar is $5 - $2 = $3
If he bought 10 full gallon jars, she spent 10 jars * $5/jar = $<<10*5=50>>50
For the half-gallon jars, she spent $3/jar * 16 jars = $<<3*16=48>>48
The total amount she spent at the store is $48 + $50 = $<<48+50=98>>98

3. We know that 5 students like to play basketball.
4. The rest of the students like to either play video games or play music.
5. The number of students that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball.

First, let's find out how many students like to play music:
Since there are 5 students who like to play basketball, and the number of students that like to play music is twice that, there must be 5 * 2 = \boxed{10} students who like to play music.

Now, let's calculate the number of students who like to play video games. Since each student has one hobby, and we know the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music, we can subtract these numbers from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games:
50 (total students) - 10 (bake) - 5 (basketball) - 10 (music) = \boxed{25} students who like to play video games.</s>","The number of students that like to play music is twice as many as the number who like basketball, so 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10

                [/INST] First, let's break down the problem into simpler parts.

1. Jeremy saw 12 birds initially.
2. He scared away 1/3 of that number of birds. To find out how many birds he scared away, we calculate 1/3 of 12.
   1/3 of 12 = 12/3 = 4 birds
3. So, 4 birds were scared away. This means there are 12 - 4 = 8 birds left.
4. Then, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. So, we add 20 to the 8 birds that were left.
   8 + 20 = 28 birds

So, the final answer is {there are 28 birds in the backyard}.</s>","The total number of birds scared away after he threw the stone at them is 1/3 * 12 = <<1/3*12=4>>4 birds.
The total number of birds remaining is 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 birds.
If 20 more birds joined, the total number of birds in the backyard will become 8 + 20 = <<8+20=28>>28 birds.

                [/INST] 1. First, let's find out how many students are in each class. Since the two classes have a total of 80 students and each class has the same amount of students, we divide the total number of students by the number of classes.
   Students per class = Total students / Number of classes
   = 80 students / 2
   = 40 students

2. Next, we need to find out how many students are girls in each class. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we calculate 40% of the students per class.
   Girls per class = Students per class * Percentage of girls
   = 40 students * 40%
   = 40 students * 0.4
   = 16 girls

3. Finally, to find out how many boys are in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.
   Boys per class = Students per class - Girls per class
   = 40 students - 16 girls
   = 24 boys

The final answer is {24 boys}.</s>","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.
The girls in each class make up to 40%, so there are 40/100 * 40 = <<40/100*40=16>>16 girls in each of them.
That means the rest of the class are boys, so there are 40 - 16 = <<40-16=24>>24 boys in each class.

Total animals = Dogs + Cats + Birds + Horses
Total animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12

Total animals = 28

Next, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week to find out how many animals will be groomed each day:

Animals per day = Total animals / Days per week
Animals per day = 28 / 7

Animals per day = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day.

1. First, let's calculate the total cost of the 3 packs of cards. He bought 3 packs at $1800 each. So, the total cost is $1800 * 3 = $5400.

2. Next, let's add the value of the two rare cards. One is worth $4000 and the other is worth $1000. So, the total value of these cards is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

3. Then, let's calculate the value of the remaining 30 cards. On average, they are worth $50 each. So, the total value of these cards is $50 * 30 = $1500.

4. Now, let's calculate the total value of all the cards Mark sold. This is the sum of the value of the rare cards and the average value of the other cards. So, the total value is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

The total number of students is 54, and they are separated into six groups of equal size. So, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups to find out how many students are in each group.
Students in each group = Total students / Number of groups
Students in each group = 54 / 6 = 9

In the first scenario, there are 6 groups, and in the second scenario, there are 12 groups.

Step 4: Calculate the difference in the number of groups needed.
We subtract the number of groups in the first scenario from the number of groups in the second scenario to find out how many more groups are needed.

                    question:
                    Candy has ! a chair ; rental business. During . the weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each ; day; but during ; weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. : If this , continues, . how many : chairs in total will : Candy ! be able to rent out in ! two 4-week months?
                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the total number of days in two 4-week months. Since a month typically has 4 weeks, two months would have 8 weeks. Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. So, the total number of days in two months is:
   - Weekdays: 5 days/week * 8 weeks = 40 days
   - Weekends: 2 days/week * 8 weeks = 16 days

2. Next, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented during the weekdays and the weekends separately.
   - Weekdays: 60 chairs/day * 40 days = 2400 chairs
   - Weekends: 100 chairs/day * 16 days = 1600 chairs

3. Finally, we add these two amounts together to find the total number of chairs that Candy can rent out in two months.
   - Total chairs: 2400 chairs + 1600 chairs = 4000 chairs

So, Candy will be able to rent out a total of 4000 chairs in two 4-week months.</s>","During weekdays, a total of 60 x 5 = <<60*5=300>>300 chairs are rented.
During the weekends, a total of 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200 chairs are rented.
In a week, 300 + 200 = <<300+200=500>>500 chairs are rented.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, 500 x 4 = <<500*4=2000>>2000 chairs are rented in a month.
Thus, a total of 2000 x 2 = <<2000*2=4000>>4000 chairs are rented in two months.

                [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of bananas Arnold stole on the first day.
Arnold stole half of the bananas from Gunther's pile, which initially had 48 bananas. So, Arnold stole 48/2 = 24 bananas on the first day.

Step 2: Determine the number of bananas in Gunther's pile after Arnold's first theft.
After Arnold's first theft, Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.

Step 3: Determine the number of bananas Gunther added to his pile on the second day.
Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile on the second day, so the total number of bananas in his pile became 24 + 25 = 49.

Step 4: Determine the number of bananas Arnold stole on the second day.
Arnold stole another 12 bananas from Gunther's pile on the second day. So, the total number of bananas in Gunther's pile after Arnold's second theft became 49 - 12 = 37.

Step 5: Determine the number of bananas Gunther added to his pile on the third day.
Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile on the third day, so the total number of bananas in his pile became 37 + 6 = 43.

Step 6: Determine the number of bananas in Gunther's pile on the third day after he counted them.
On the third day, after Gunther counted his bananas, he found that there were 43 bananas in his pile.

So, the final answer is:
\boxed{43}</s>","Half of 48 bananas is 48/2=<<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
Arnold's first act of thievery removes 24 bananas, leaving 48-24=24 bananas.
Starting with the remaining 24 bananas, adding 25 bananas to the pile brings the total to 24+25=<<24+25=49>>49 bananas.
Arnold's second act of thievery resulted in 49-12=<<49-12=37>>37 bananas remaining.
Gunther adds another 6 bananas, resulting in the final number of 37+6=<<37+6=43>>43 bananas.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that each roommate will pay an equal share of the monthly electricity bill. The monthly bill is $100 and there are 4 roommates.

2. To find out how much each roommate pays per month, we divide the total monthly bill by the number of roommates. So, $100 divided by 4 equals $25.

3. Now, to find out how much each roommate pays per year, we need to multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

4. So, $25 multiplied by 12 equals $300.

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity. {The final answer is: $300}</s>","There are 12 months in a year, so the total electricity for the year will cost 100*12 =$<<100*12=1200>>1200.

1. First, let's calculate how many small stickers Lorraine trades away. She trades away 90% of her 30 small stickers, which is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.

2. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, Lorraine now has 30 - 27 = 3 small buttons.

3. Next, let's calculate how many large buttons Lorraine trades away. She trades away 50% of her 40 large stickers, which is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.

4. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. So, 20 large stickers are worth 20 large buttons, and she has 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

2. The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as against it. Let's denote the number of votes against as x.
3. Therefore, the number of votes in favor is 2x.
4. The total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and votes against. So, 2x + x = 33.
5. Solving this equation gives us 3x = 33.
6. Therefore, x = 11.
7. So, there were 11 votes against the new regulation.
8. And since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, there were 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

2. Small shirts: Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 11 * 2 = 22 students need size small.

3. Medium shirts: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win. Since 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win, we first need to determine the number of remaining people. This is P minus the number of people who think horse #2 will win, or P - 0.20 * P. So, the number of people who think horse #7 will win is 0.60 * (P - 0.20 * P).

Step 3: Calculate the number of people who think horse #12 will win. This is the remainder of the people, so it's P minus the number of people who think horse #2 will win and the number of people who think horse #7 will win. So, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is P - 0.20 * P - 0.60 * (P - 0.20 * P).

Step 4: Given that P is not explicitly stated in the question, we need to find a way to express the number of people who think horse #12 will win in terms of P. This can be simplified as P - 0.20P - 0.60(0.80P) = P - 0.20P - 0.48P = 0.12P.

2. Ava gave him $y = 1/2 * $90 = $45.
3. Jayden wants to buy a camera that costs $z = $200.

Now, let's find out how much Jayden needs to buy the camera. He has already $x + $y = $70 + $45 = $115. So, he still needs $z - ($x + $y) = $200 - $115 = $85 to buy the camera.

\boxed{The final answer is: Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.}</s>","Ava gave $90/2 = $<<90/2=45>>45 to Jayden.
Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $<<70+45=115>>115

How many ? cases : of shingles will , the third house need?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that the three homes will need a total of 250 cases of shingles.
2. The first house needs half of what the second house needs.
3. The third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles for the first house as x. Then, the second house will need 2x (since it's twice as much as the first house), and the third house will need 2x (since it's twice as much as the first house).

The total number of cases of shingles for all three houses is the sum of the cases for each house, which can be represented as:

x + 2x + 2x = 250

Solving this equation gives:

5x = 250

x = 250 / 5

x = 50

So, the first house will need 50 cases of shingles. Since the third house needs double this amount, it will need:

2 * 50 = 100 cases of shingles

{The final answer is 100}</s>","Let x be the number of cases of shingles for the second house
The first house needs 1/2 x cases of shingles
The third house needs 2(1/2)x=x cases of shingles
250=x+x+(1/2)x
250=(5/2)x
250(2/5)=100=x
The third house needs 100 cases of shingles

2. Jack buys 1 head of lettuce at $3 each. So, Jack's spending is $3.
3. Chase buys 0.5 tomatoes at $1 each. So, Chase's spending is 0.5 * $1 = $0.5.

George has 45% more pears than bananas. If he has 200 bananas, then he has 45% more pears than 200 bananas.

Step 2: Calculate the additional number of pears.
To find out how many more pears George has, multiply the number of bananas by 45% (or 0.45).

Step 3: Determine the total number of pears.
Now, add the additional number of pears to the original number of bananas to find out how many pears George has.
200 bananas + 90 pears = 290 pears

Step 4: Calculate the total number of fruits.

Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also gets an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday would be:

$75 + $5 = $80

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for Wednesday would be:

2 hours * $15/hour = $30

She doesn't teach more than 3 classes, so she doesn't get the additional $5 per day.

To find out Tanya's total earnings for these two days, we need to add her earnings from Monday and Wednesday together:

1. Calculate the total sales for vanilla scents. Since they sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents available, the total sales for vanilla scents would be 5 vanilla scents * 4 = 20 vanilla scents sold.

2. Calculate the total sales for fruity scents. Since they sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents available, the total sales for fruity scents would be 2 fruity scents * 8 = 16 fruity scents sold.

3. Subtract the total sales of fruity scents from the total sales of vanilla scents to find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents. So, 20 vanilla scents sold - 16 fruity scents sold = 4 more vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents.

1. Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. This means he makes 20 * $3 = $60 from eggplants.
2. He has 25 ears of corn to sell. Let's say he sells each ear of corn for x dollars. So, he will make 25 * x dollars from corn.
3. Bennet wants to make a total of $

135. So, we can set up the following equation: 60 (from eggplants) + 25x (from corn) = 135
4. Solving for x, we get: 25x = 135 - 60, which simplifies to 25x = 75, and x = 75 / 25 = $3.

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3 to make a total of $135. {The final answer is $3.}</s>","From his eggplants, Bennet makes 20 * $3 = $<<20*3=60>>60

1. First, we need to determine the total weekend hours Tatiana has. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which adds up to 12 hours in total.

2. Next, we need to calculate the remaining time after Tatiana reads for 3 hours. So, 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours left.

3. Now, we need to determine how much time Tatiana spends playing video games. Since she spends 1/3 of the remaining time playing video games, we calculate 1/3 of 9 hours, which equals 3 hours.

4. To find out how much time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we subtract the video game hours from the remaining hours after reading. So, 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours spent playing soccer.

5. To find the percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we divide the soccer hours by the total weekend hours and then multiply by 100. So, (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%.

1. First, let's calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum. Distance = Speed * Time, so Time = Distance / Speed. The museum is 150 miles away, and Jack drives at 75 mph, so the time it takes to drive to the museum is 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours.

2. Similarly, the time it takes to drive back home is also 2 hours.

3. Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

4. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is the time it takes to drive to the museum plus the time it takes to drive back home plus the time he spends at the museum. That's 2 hours + 2 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours.

                [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that the price of a laptop is $1000 and it offers a 20% discount. The question is asking for the amount one has to pay after the discount.

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount
To calculate the discount amount, you need to find 20% of $1000.
The formula for calculating the percentage of a number is: (Percentage/100) * Number
So, the discount amount = (20/100) * $1000 = $200

Step 3: Calculate the final price
After finding the discount amount, subtract it from the original price to get the final price.
Final price = Original price - Discount amount = $1000 - $200 = $800

The final answer is {The final price is $800}</s>","You will get a discount of 20/100 x $1000 = $<<20/100*1000=200>>200.
Therefore, you will have to pay $1000 - $200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the number of movies in the different series. A third of the 600 movies are in various series, so that's 600 / 3 = 200 movies.

Since he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie, the total cost for these series would be 200 * $6 = $1200.

Next, we calculate the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies (400 after removing the series) are older movies, so that's 400 * 0.4 = 160 movies.

Since these movies are $5 each, the total cost for the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the remaining movies. There are 400 movies left (after removing the series and older movies), and since a normal movie costs $10, the total cost for these movies is 400 * $10 = $4000.

Finally, we add up all the costs: $1200 (series), $800 (older movies), and $4000 (remaining movies). So, the total cost is $1200 + $800 + $4000 = $6000.

Therefore, {The final answer is} replacing the movies costs $6000.</s>","There are 600/3=<<600/3=200>>200 movies in series

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit Winston picked.

For peaches, the cost is $2.00 per pound. If Winston picked 6 pounds, then the cost would be 2*6 = $12.00.

2. For plums, the cost is $1.00 per pound. If Winston picked 8 pounds, then the cost would be 1*8 = $8.00.

3. For apricots, the cost is $3.00 per pound. If Winston picked 6 pounds, then the cost would be 3*6 = $18.00.

4. Finally, we add up the costs of all the fruits Winston picked to get the total cost. So, $12.00 (peaches) + $8.00 (plums) + $18.00 (apricots) = $38.00.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

1. The family drove an average speed of 50 miles per hour. Let's denote the distance they drove as D_drive.

2. They hiked an average speed of half of their driving speed minus 5 miles per hour, which is (50/2) - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15 miles per hour.

3. It took them 1.5 hours to hike, so the distance they hiked, D_hike, can be calculated as D_hike = speed * time = 15 miles/hour * 1.5 hours = 22.5 miles.

4. The total time they spent traveling was 6 hours, and we know that 1.5 hours were spent hiking. So, the time they spent driving, T_drive, is 6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours.

5. Now we can calculate the distance they drove, D_drive, as D_drive = speed * time = 50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 225 miles.

The final answer is the total distance they traveled to reach their vacation spot, which is the sum of the distances they drove and hiked, so D_total = D_drive + D_hike = 225 miles + 22.5 miles = \boxed{247.5 miles}.</s>","Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.
Hence, their average speed hiking was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour.
So, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.
It took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.
So, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.
Therefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.

                [/INST] To solve this problem step by step, we can break down the information given and calculate the difference between Ava and Emma's scores based on the points they can earn for each action in the game.

1. Ava and Emma each play one level of the game.
2. They are each given points for different actions:
   - 10 points for every enemy they jump on.
   - 5 points for each berry they collect.
   - 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level.

Now let's analyze the given information:

- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Since we need to find the difference between their two scores, we can set up an equation where the difference in points for enemies, berries, and remaining time is calculated.

Let's use ""E"" to represent the number of enemies Emma jumps on and ""B"" for the number of berries she collects. Then Ava jumps on E+8 enemies and collects B+3 berries.

The points Ava earns from enemies can be represented as 10*(E+8), and the points Emma earns as 10*E. The difference in points from enemies is then 10*(E+8) - 10*E = 80.

For berries, Ava's points would be 5*(B+3), and Emma's points would be 5*B. The difference in points from berries is then 5*(B+3) - 5*B = 15.

For the remaining time, Ava's points would be 30*(T - 4), and Emma's points would be 30*T. The difference in points from remaining time is then 30*(T - 4) - 30*T = -120.

The total difference between their scores is the sum of the differences in points from enemies, berries, and remaining time:

Difference = 80 (from enemies) + 15 (from berries) -120 (from remaining time)
Difference = 95 - 120
Difference = -25

Since the difference is negative, it means Emma's score is 25 points higher than Ava's.

The final answer is {Emma's score is 25 points higher than Ava's}.</s>","For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.
For collecting berries, Emma earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 fewer points than Ava.
For finishing the level faster, Emma earns 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 more points than Ava.
Overall, Emma has 120 – 80 - 15 = <<120-80-15=25>>25 more points than Ava.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. On regular days, Chase and Rider ride their bikes three times a day. There are 5 regular days, so they ride their bikes a total of 3 (times per day) * 5 (days) = 15 times in a 5-day period.

2. On two other days, they ride twice the number of times they do on regular days. So, on these days, they ride 3 (times per regular day) * 2 (twice the number) = 6 times each day. Over two days, this amounts to 6 (times per day) * 2 (days) = 12 times.

3. Adding the number of times they ride their bikes on regular days and the number of times they ride on the two other days gives us the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week. So, we add 15 (times in a 5-day period) + 12 (times on the two other days) = 27 times.

So, {The final answer is 27}.</s>","Each person rides his bike 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 times for 5 days.

                [/INST] The problem states that Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 orange and 4 white. He bought some more fish, and when he added them to his pond, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. We need to find out how many white fish Bob bought at the store.

Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Bob initially had 4 white fish in his pond. Since he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white, let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'o'.

2. The total number of fish in his pond after adding the new ones is 7 (initial) + w (new white) + o (new orange).

3. The new total number of white fish is 4 (initial) + w (new white), and the new total number of orange fish is 3 (initial) + o (new orange).

4. We know that the new total number of orange fish is twice the new total number of white fish. So, we can write this as an equation: 3 + o = 2(4 + w).

5. Simplifying this equation, we get: 3 + o = 8 + 2w, which implies o = 5 + 2w.

6. We also know that the total number of fish Bob took from the mixed tank at the pet shop is

17. Since the mixed tank has both white and orange fish, we can write another equation: 7 (initial) + w (new white) + o (new orange) = 17.

7. Substituting o = 5 + 2w from step 5 into this equation, we get: 7 + w + 5 + 2w = 17, which simplifies to 3w = 5.

8. Solving for w, we get w = 5/3. However, since the number of fish must be a whole number, this is not possible.

9. The problem must have some inconsistencies. If we assume that the mixed tank at the pet shop had only white fish, then the total number of fish Bob took from the tank would be the new total number of white fish. So, 4 (initial) + w = 17, which gives w = 13.

10. But then, according to our initial equation (3 + o = 2(4 + w)), we would have 3 + o = 2(4 + 13), which gives o = 24. This is not possible either, as the total number of fish in the pond is only 17 after adding the new ones.

11. So, the problem has some inconsistencies and cannot be solved as stated.

{The final answer is: The problem cannot be solved as stated due to inconsistencies.}</s>","Bob started with 7 fish and bought seventeen, so he had 7 + 17 = <<7+17=24>>24 fish.
Let x = the number of white fish.
Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so 2*x + x = 24 fish
3*x = 24
x = 24/3 = <<24/3=8>>8 white fish.
Bob started with 4 white fish, so he bought 8 - 4 = 4 white fish at the store.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work and back home every day and the one-way distance is 5 miles, the total daily distance is 5 miles to work + 5 miles back home = 10 miles. Over 5 days (Monday to Friday), the total distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.

2. Next, we need to calculate how many gallons of gas Andy's car consumes in a week. Given that the car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon (MPG), we can calculate the total gallons used by dividing the total miles by the fuel efficiency: 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.

3. Finally, to find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we multiply the total gallons used by the price per gallon. Given that the price for regular gas is $3/gallon, the total cost is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

So, the final answer is \boxed{15} dollars per week.</s>","Between Monday to Friday there are 5 days
If the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles the total round trip distance Andy drives daily is 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 miles

If his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, then his car is consuming a total of 50 miles / 10 MPG = <<50/10=5>>5 gallons of gas each week
Given that each gallon of gas costs $3, then his car is consuming 5 * $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 worth of gas each week

1. Carrie was given 10 twenties. Each twenty is worth $20. So, 10 twenties = 10 * $20 = $200.

2. She was also given 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25. So, 140 quarters = 140 * $0.25 = $35.

3. Carrie spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties.

4. 3/5 of the twenties = 3/5 * $200 = $120.

5. The total amount of money Carrie spent is the sum of the quarters she spent and the twenties she spent.

6. So, the total amount of money Carrie spent is $35 (from the quarters) + $120 (from the twenties) = $155.

Therefore, the final answer is {The total amount of money Carrie spent is $155}.</s>","Since she spent all the quarters, she paid her lunch partly by quarters totaling 140*$0.25 = $<<140*0.25=35>>35

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we calculate the number of tomatoes Ricardo gets. He has 5 tomato plants, and each yields 22 tomatoes. So, 5 tomato plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes.

2. Next, we calculate the number of eggplants. He has 8 eggplant plants, and each yields 4 eggplants. So, 8 eggplant plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants.

3. Finally, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants together to get the total number of fruits. So, 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

Therefore, the final answer is Ricardo can get {142} fruits from his plants.</s>","Ricardo can get 22 x 5 = <<22*5=110>>110 tomatoes.
He can get 4 x 8 = <<4*8=32>>32 eggplants.

1. First, let's find out how many smart TVs and analog TVs were sold. If one-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, then 1/4 of 40 = 10 smart TVs were sold.

2. Similarly, if one-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, then 1/8 of 40 = 5 analog TVs were sold.

3. Now, subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales to find out how many OLED TVs were sold. This gives us 40 - 10 - 5 = 25 OLED TVs.

{The final answer is} 25 OLED TVs were sold.</s>","Samwell was able to sell 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 Smart TVs.

John has $50 saved up. So the total amount of money he will have after the school's contribution is $50 + $150 = $200.

To find out how much money John is missing to fully pay for the trip, we subtract the total amount he will have from the total cost of the trip: $300 - $200 = $100.

Therefore, John is missing $100 to fully pay for the trip. {The final answer is: John is missing $100 for the trip.}</s>","John's school has decided to pay 300 / 2 = $<<300/2=150>>150 for his trip.

                [/INST] The problem involves determining how many logs Carson needs to burn to keep his house from freezing, given certain conditions. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the initial temperature**: The problem states that the temperature was 45 degrees during the day. However, it would be more accurate to refer to the initial temperature as the temperature we want to keep, which is 32 degrees (just above the freezing point) since Carson wants to prevent the pipes from freezing.

2. **Determine the temperature drop at night**: The problem states that it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day. If we were to assume the initial temperature of 45 degrees, this would mean a temperature of -88 degrees at night, which is not possible. The problem should state that the initial temperature is the target temperature, which is 32 degrees, and the night temperature is 32 - 33 = -1 degrees.

3. **Determine how much Carson needs to heat up the house**: Carson wants to keep his house at 32 degrees. If it gets to -1 degrees at night, he needs to heat it up by 32 - (-1) = 33 degrees.

4. **Determine how many logs Carson needs to burn**: The problem states that every log burns produces a 5-degree increase in the house. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 33 / 5 = 6.6 logs.

Since it's not possible to burn a fraction of a log, Carson would need to burn 7 logs (rounding up to the next whole number) to ensure his house doesn't fall below 32 degrees.

So, the final answer is that Carson needs to burn 7 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.</s>","First find the night-time temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees
Then find how much Carson needs to heat his house to avoid the pipes freezing: 32 degrees - 12 degrees = <<32-12=20>>20 degrees
Then divide the amount of heat Carson needs by the amount of heat each log produces: 20 degrees / 5 degrees/log = <<20/5=4>>4 logs

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many groups were formed from the 90 people. Since each group has 9 members, we divide the total number of people by the number of members per group: 90 / 9 = 10 groups.

2. Next, we find out how many groups have 3/5 of the total number of groups. Since there are 10 groups in total, we calculate: 10 * (3/5) = 6 groups.

3. Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells each. So, we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought back: 6 * 2 = 12 seashells.

So, the final answer is {12 seashells}.</s>","Since the total number of people at the competition was 90, they formed 90/9=<<90/9=10>>10 groups after splitting into 9-person groups.
If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bringing back 2 seashells each, then 3/5*10=<<3/5*10=6>>6 groups had members bringing back 2 seashells.
Since each group had 9 people, the number of people in the 6 groups, who found 2 seashells each, was 6*9= <<6*9=54>>54.

3. At the next stop, another 38 people get off. So, we subtract 38 from the current total. This gives us 138 - 38.

First, let's calculate her regular pay for the first 8 hours:

8 hours * $20/hour = $160

Next, let's calculate her special hourly rate:

$20/hour * 150% = $30/hour

Now, let's calculate how many hours she worked under the special hourly rate. She worked in total 11 hours, so:

11 hours - 8 hours = 3 hours

Next, let's calculate her pay for these 3 hours under the special rate:

3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Finally, let's add her regular pay and her special pay to get her total pay for the day:

3. The problem also states that there are 14 lion cubs in the enclosure.
4. To find the total number of lions (not just the adults), we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. So, the total number of lions = 12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32.

1. First, we need to calculate the total number of employees after three months. The company hires 20 new employees every month, so after three months, they will have hired 20*3 = 60 new employees.

2. Adding these 60 employees to the initial workforce of 200, the total number of employees after three months will be 200 + 60 = 260 employees.

3. Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. So, for 260 employees, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month would be 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000.

4. Since we are looking for the total amount of money paid over three months, we multiply the monthly payment by 3. So, the total amount of money paid to all employees over three months is $1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000.

The final answer is {The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3,120,000}.</s>","If each month the company hire 20 new employees, the total number of employees in the company in the first month is 200 employees + 20 employees = <<200+20=220>>220 employees

In the second month, 20 more workers are hired, bringing the total number of employees to 220 employees + 20 employees = 240 employees
The company pays a total of 240 employees * $4000/employee = $<<240*4000=960000>>960000 in wages for its employees in the second month.

                [/INST] Let's break this down:

1. Billy was first hired at a rate of $10 per hour.
2. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new hourly rate is $10.50 per hour.
3. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, so his new hourly rate is $11.50 per hour.
4. Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so it was $10.50 per hour.
5. Both Billy and Sally work 20 hours.

Now let's calculate their earnings:

Billy's earnings = $11.50 * 20 = $230
Sally's earnings = $10.50 * 20 = $210

Now let's find the difference between their earnings:

Difference = Billy's earnings - Sally's earnings = $230 - $210 = $20

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally in dollars.

\boxed{20}</s>","Billy has a salary of $10+0.50+$1.00=$<<10+0.5+1=11.50>>11.50 per hour.
Sally is paid $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, for a total of $10+$0.50=$<<10+0.5=10.50>>10.50 per hour.
If Billy works 20 hours, he will be paid 20*$11.50=$<<20*11.5=230>>230
If Sally works 20 hours, she will be paid 20*$10.50=$<<20*10.50=210>>210.
Thus, if both work 20 hours, Billy will be paid $230-$210=$20 more.

2. We also know that a bagel costs $1 each.
3. We are asked to find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels.

So, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:

Cost of 3 loaves = 3 * $2 (since each loaf costs $2)

Now, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:

Cost of 2 bagels = 2 * $1 (since each bagel costs $1)
= $2

Finally, let's find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels:

Additional cost = Cost of 3 loaves - Cost of 2 bagels

1. First, let's calculate the total number of students in the school. We know there are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is 25 students/class * 40 classes = 1000 students.

2. Next, let's calculate the total number of teachers. We know there are 3 teachers per class and 40 classes. So, the total number of teachers is 3 teachers/class * 40 classes = 120 teachers.

3. Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees.

4. Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

5. To find the total number of trees planted during the campaign, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers. So, the total number of trees is 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees.

If she wants to , buy enough ; stuffed . goats, ? such that the percentage . of stuffed goats is 30% of all : of : her stuffed animals, how many stuffed goats should ! she buy?
                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has.

Total stuffed animals = 3 (dogs) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Next, let's find out what 30% of this total is, as that's the number of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to have as a percentage of her total collection.

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't have a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round this up to 5. This means she wants her stuffed goats to make up 50% (rounded up from 42%) of her collection.

Now, let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as G. So, the equation to find G is:

G = Total stuffed animals - Current total stuffed animals - Number of stuffed animals left (as a percentage)
G = 14 - 14 - G*0.5 (since 50% of the total should be goats)

Solving for G gives us:

2*G = 14
G = 7

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 7 stuffed goats to make them 50% (rounded up from 42%) of her collection.

Final answer: {Bubbles should buy 7 stuffed goats}

Alternative solution:

If we were to consider the exact percentage (42%) instead of rounding up to 50%, we would find the closest value by first determining the total number of stuffed animals needed to achieve that percentage.

Total stuffed animals needed = Total stuffed animals / (100% / Desired percentage)
Total stuffed animals needed = 14 / (100% / 42%)
Total stuffed animals needed ≈ 42.857

Since this is not a whole number, we round down to 42. This would mean the number of stuffed goats needed would be:

Stuffed goats needed = 42 - 14 (current stuffed animals) = 28

So, if we allow for fractions of stuffed animals, Bubbles would need to buy approximately 28 stuffed goats to make them 42% of her collection. However, this solution requires considering fractions of animals, which might not be practical or meaningful in a real-life scenario.</s>","Let x = the number of stuffed goats.
The current number of stuffed animals are (puppies + koalas + zebras + frogs) or 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = <<3+5+2+4=14>>14 stuffed animals total.
Take the total stuffed animals, add x and divide by the number of stuffed goats to get to 30% or x / (14 + x) = .3
Cross multiply to get x = 0.42 + .3x
Subtract .3 x from each side, .7x = 0.42
Bubbles needs x = <<6=6>>6 goats added.

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the total time Kris plays per day for the first two weeks. She plays for half an hour each day, so for two weeks (14 days), she plays for 7 hours (since 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours).

2. Next, let's calculate the total time Kris plays for the third week. She plays for 2 hours every day for 7 days, so she plays for 14 hours (since 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours).

3. Now, let's add up all the hours Kris has played. She played for 7 hours in the first two weeks and 14 hours in the third week, so she has played for 21 hours (since 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours).

4. To find out how many more hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we subtract the number of hours she has already played from the total number of hours required for the achievement. The achievement requires 30 hours, so she still needs to play for 9 hours (since 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours).

{The final answer is \boxed{9}}</s>","Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.
So playing for half an hour every day means Kris will have played for 0.5 hours * 14 days = <<0.5*14=7>>7 hours.
Playing for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.
She therefore still needs to play 30 – 7 – 14 = <<30-7-14=9>>9 hours.

Now let's solve it step by step:
5. In one hour, the second car will cover 10 miles more than the first car (70 mph - 60 mph).
6. After 2 hours, the second car will cover 20 miles more than the first car (10 miles/hour * 2 hours).

Therefore, the final answer is:

{After 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.}</s>","In two hours, the first car will have traveled 60*2 = <<60*2=120>>120 miles.

1. First, we need to find the total cost of the ring before the premium. This is the cost of the diamond plus the cost of the gold, which is $600 + $300 = $900.

2. Next, we need to calculate the premium. Since James pays a 30% premium, we multiply the total cost ($900) by 30% (or 0.3). So, $900 * 0.3 = $270.

3. Finally, to find the total amount James paid, we add the premium to the original cost of the ring. So, $900 + $270 = $1,170.

   - Third grade: 340 out of 500, so the pass rate is 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%.
   - Fourth grade: 40 out of 100, so the pass rate is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.
   - Fifth grade: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth grade, so it's 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%.

2. Now, let's calculate the total number of students and the total number of students who passed.
   - Total number of students = 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000 students.
   - Total number of students who passed = 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade, since 80% of 400 is 320) = 700 students.

3. Finally, let's calculate the overall pass rate.
   - Overall pass rate = Total number of students who passed / Total number of students = 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

Therefore, the school's overall pass rate is 70%. {The final answer is \boxed{70\%}.}</s>","First find the pass rate for the fourth graders: 40 students / 100 students = <<40/100=.4>>.4

Then multiply the fifth graders' pass rate by the number of fifth graders to find the total number of fifth graders who passed: .8 * 400 fifth graders = <<.8*400=320>>320 fifth graders

Milo ; wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. , If : he has . two bags of glass chips, how many ! inches long can he ? make , his mosaic?
                [/INST] The first step in solving this problem is to understand the relationship between the glass chips and the area of the mosaic. We know that 12 glass chips can cover 1 square inch of the mosaic. However, we're concerned with the dimensions of the mosaic, not the area.

The area of the mosaic isn't given in the problem, but we do know that Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. So, we can think of the mosaic as having a height and a length, and an area equal to their product.

Next, we need to calculate how many glass chips Milo has. He has two bags, each holding 72 chips, for a total of 144 chips.

We can use the ratio of glass chips to mosaic height to find out how many inches of the mosaic can be covered by 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to cover 1 square inch of mosaic, Milo can cover 144 / 12 = 12 square inches with his glass chips.

Now, we can use the mosaic height to find out how many inches long the mosaic can be. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, the length can be found by dividing the total area (in square inches) by the height (in inches). So, 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The mosaic can be 4 inches long.}</s>","Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.
With those, he can make 144 / 12 = <<144/12=12>>12 square inches of mosaic.
Thus, Milo can make his 3 inch tall mosaic 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to understand that 1 quart is equal to 0.25 gallons. So, if we want to convert quarts to gallons, we multiply the number of quarts by 0.25.

2. The problem states that there are 10 quarts of tea left. So, to convert this to gallons, we multiply by 0.25.
   Tea left in gallons = 10 quarts * 0.25 gallon/quart
   = 2.5 gallons

3. Next, we need to calculate how much tea was consumed by the students. There were 4 students who drank 1.5 quarts each, and 16 students who drank 2 quarts each.
   Total tea consumed by first group of students = 1.5 quarts/student * 4 students
   = 6 quarts
   Total tea consumed by second group of students = 2 quarts/student * 16 students
   = 32 quarts

4. We add the amount of tea consumed by both groups of students:
   Total tea consumed = 6 quarts + 32 quarts
   = 38 quarts

5. Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we convert the total tea consumed to gallons.
   Total tea consumed in gallons = 38 quarts * (1 gallon / 4 quarts)
   = 9.5 gallons

6. Finally, we add the amount of tea left to the amount of tea consumed to find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party.
   Total tea at beginning of party = Tea left in gallons + Total tea consumed in gallons
   = 2.5 gallons + 9.5 gallons
   = 12 gallons

So, the final answer is:

\boxed{12} gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party.</s>","4 students drank 1.5 quarts = 4 * 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6 quarts

He started ; off with ! 100 total that he ordered , and wanted ; to sell, : but he ended ; up , selling 150 : butterscotch . candies. : Then he ordered 100 more. . How many does Dale still ; need to sell to sell all of his : candy?
                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. Dale initially ordered 100 candies and planned to sell them all.
2. He ended up selling 150 candies. This means he must have sold the initial 100 candies he ordered, plus 50 more.
3. After selling 150 candies, Dale ordered 100 more. Now he has a total of 200 candies (100 initial + 100 more).
4. To find out how many more candies Dale needs to sell to meet his goal of selling all his candies, we subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he has.

So, Dale still needs to sell 200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 candies.

Therefore, the final answer is Dale needs to sell \boxed{50} more candies.</s>","Dale starts off selling 100 butterscotch candies that he ordered, but ends up selling 150, 100 - 150 = <<100-150=-50>>-50 candies.
So Dale orders 100 more candies to make up for the deficit and to sell even more, -50 candies + 100 candies = <<100-50=50>>50 candies Dale has left and still needs to sell.

                [/INST] Let's analyze each part of the question step by step:

1. There are 10 students on campus at the beginning of the year.

2. The number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month.

3. We want to find out how many additional students would have joined by the end of May.

To find out the number of students on campus by the end of May, we need to calculate the cumulative effect of the doubling for each month.

If we let S be the number of students on campus at any given point, then:

- S at the end of January = S_begin (doubled) = 10 * 2 = 20
- S at the end of February = S_begin * 2 = 20 * 2 = 40
- S at the end of March = S_begin * 2^2 = 40 * 2 = 80
- S at the end of April = S_begin * 2^3 = 80 * 2 = 160
- S at the end of May = S_begin * 2^4 = 160 * 2 = 320

Now, to find out how many additional students would have joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

Additional students = S_end_May - S_begin
Additional students = 320 - 10
Additional students = 310

{The final answer is the 310 additional students that would have joined by the end of May.}</s>","At the end of January, the number of students doubles to 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20
At the end of February, the number of students increases to 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40
By the end of March, the number of students doubles to 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80
By the end of April, the number of students is 2*80=<<2*80=160>>160
At the end of May, the number of students has doubled to 2*160=<<2*160=320>>320
If there were initially 10 students, 320-10=<<320-10=310>>310 students would join the campus by the end of May.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. First, let's find out how much Felix charges for climbing one branch.

In the problem, it's stated that every branch he has to climb costs $0.25. So, Felix charges $0.25 per branch.

2. Next, we need to determine how many branches Felix climbed in total during the week.

We know that Felix made $105 during the week and that he charges $0.25 for every branch. So, the total number of branches Felix climbed can be calculated by dividing the total amount of money he made by the amount he charges per branch.

Total branches = Total money made / Money charged per branch
= $105 / $0.25/branch
= 420 branches

3. Finally, we need to find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average.

The problem states that the week considered has 7 days. So, we need to divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to get the average number of branches climbed per day.

Branches per day = Total branches / Total days
= 420 branches / 7 days
= 60 branches/day

The final answer is {Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day}.</s>","He climbed 420 branches in total because 105 / .25 = <<105/.25=420>>420

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of petals on the flowers that Rose puts in the vase after dropping one of each type and having them blown away. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Rose starts by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each. So, the total number of petals from these flowers is 3 * 5 = 15 petals.

2. She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each. So, the total number of petals from these flowers is 4 * 6 = 24 petals.

3. She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each. So, the total number of petals from these flowers is 5 * 4 = 20 petals.

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. So, the total number of petals from these flowers is 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

5. She drops one of each type of flower, but since we're asked for the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we don't need to consider the dropped flowers as they are not in the vase.

6. She puts the remaining flowers in the vase. The total number of flowers she has put in the vase is 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18 flowers.

7. The total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is the sum of the petals from all the flowers she picked minus the petals from the flowers she dropped. However, since she dropped one of each type, the net effect on the total number of petals in the vase is zero because she dropped one flower of each type, which cancels out.

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

Therefore, {The final answer is: The total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is 101}.</s>","Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.
Finally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.
Rose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.
But the wind blows 5+6+4+7=<<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals worth of flowers away.
So Rose has 101-22=<<101-22=79>>79 petals worth remaining

1. John and DeSean bought a bag of 35 marshmallows.
2. Each S'more uses one marshmallow.
3. John makes 9 S'mores, so John uses 9 marshmallows.
4. DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so DeSean uses 9 marshmallows.
5. They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

Total marshmallows used = John's S'mores + DeSean's S'mores + dropped marshmallows
= 9 + 9 + 3
= 21 marshmallows

Marshmallows left in the bag = Total marshmallows - Marshmallows used
= 35 - 21
= 14 marshmallows

Since each kid can make one S'more per marshmallow, each kid can have:
= 14 / 2
= 7 S'mores

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

{The final answer is: John and DeSean can each make 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.}</s>","They used up 21 marshmallows because 9 plus 9 plus 3 equals <<9+9+3=21>>21.

They play . for 4 ? hours.  How much money is used?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Each game costs Jack 1 quarter, and we know they play for 4 hours. First, we need to convert this time into minutes because the game time is given in minutes. We know that 1 hour equals 60 minutes, so 4 hours equal 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

2. Next, we need to determine how many games they play in 240 minutes. We know that one game lasts 20 minutes, so the number of games is the total time divided by the duration of each game. So, 240 minutes / 20 minutes per game = 12 games.

3. Now, let's consider the money. We know that the cost of one game is 1 quarter, and they play 12 games. So, the total cost for Jack and his friends would be 12 games * 1 quarter per game.

4. However, two of Jack's friends can only play half as long, so their games last 10 minutes each. This means that they can play 240 minutes / 10 minutes per game = 24 games in the same time. So, they play 24 games in total (2 games each).

5. One of Jack's friends can play 1.5 times as long, so their games last 30 minutes each. They can play 240 minutes / 30 minutes per game = 8 games in the same time. So, they play 8 games in total.

6. In total, Jack and his 3 friends play 12 + 24 + 8 = 44 games. But since they each pay for their own games and Jack is playing too, we multiply by 4 (because there's Jack and each of his 3 friends). So, the total cost is 44 games * 4 players = 176 quarters.

7. Since 4 quarters equal 1 dollar, we divide the total cost by 4 to get the final cost in dollars. So, 176 quarters / 4 = $44.

So, the final answer is {The total cost is $44}.</s>","Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour

                [/INST] Let's denote the amount of salt Tanya uses as ""S"" ounces. Then, according to the problem, she uses ""S"" ounces of sugar, ""2S"" ounces of oil, and ""S/2"" ounces of zest.

Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, we have ""S = S"". That's a check, it's consistent.

She uses twice as much oil as salt, so ""2S"" is the amount of oil, which is consistent with our previous assignment.

She uses twice as much salt as zest, so ""S/2"" is the amount of zest, which is also consistent with our previous assignments.

Now, we need to find the amount of oil. From our previous assignments, we know that she uses ""2S"" ounces of oil. But we need to find the actual numerical value.

Since the jar she fills is 10 ounces and she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, it means she uses 5 ounces of salt and 5 ounces of sugar.

So, ""S = 5"" ounces. This means she uses 2*5 = 10 ounces of oil.

\boxed{10}</s>","Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.
Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.
She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.
In all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.
Thus, she uses Z = 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1 ounce of zest.

= 2 * $1500
= $3000

Finally, to find out the total amount of money John spent, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows:

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. That's 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. To find out how many cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some away to his mother, we subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from the total number of cars he originally had. So, 40 (total cars) - 8 (cars sold) - 16 (cars given away) = 16 cars.

                [/INST] The problem describes Sandy's journey from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores and then back from Sun Valley Shores to Hollowock Valley Shores over two days. The duration of her first day's journey and second day's journey are equal and she takes half as many hours on the second day as the first day. Both times are 8 hours long because she walks 8 hours on the first day and also takes half of 8 hours on the second day.

Let's calculate the total time Sandy took for these two days in hours first.

First day duration: 8 hours
Second day duration: 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Sum of both days' duration: 8 + 4 = 12 hours

To convert the total hours into minutes, multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

12 * 60 = 720 minutes

{The final answer is \boxed{720}}</s>","If she walked half as many hours on the second day as the first day, she walked for 1/2*8 = <<8*1/2=4>>4 hours on the second day.
The total time Sandy walked in the two days is 8+4 =<<8+4=12>>12 hours.
Since 1 hour has 60 minutes, Sandy walked for 12*60 = <<12*60=720>>720 minutes in the two days.

1. Hunter counted 50 cars when entering class one morning.
2. During the first break, he counted 20 more cars in the parking lot.
3. When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone.

To find the total number of cars he counted during lunch break:

1. First, we need to find out the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break:
   - Initial number of cars = 50
   - Additional cars during the first break = 20
   - Total cars after first break = Initial number of cars + Additional cars = 50 + 20 = 70
2. Then, we need to find out how many cars remained after 1/2 of them left:
   - Remaining cars = Total cars after first break - (1/2 * Total cars after first break)
   - Remaining cars = 70 - (1/2 * 70) = 70 - 35 = 35

{The final answer is 35 cars}.</s>","During the first break, he saw 20 more cars in the parking lot, which totals 50 + 20 = <<50+20=70>>70 cars

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is 6 (packages) * 6 (tins per package) = 36 tins.

Finally, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food. So, 88 (tins of cat food) - 36 (tins of dog food) = 52.

PJ has x cards.
Smendrick has y cards.
Becca has z cards.

According to the information given:

1. The total number of cards is 341.
   So, x + y + z = 341

2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
   So, z = y + 12

3. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of PJ.
   So, y = 3x

Now we can substitute y and z in terms of x into the first equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Simplifying,

7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides,

7x = 329

Dividing by 7,

x = 47

So, PJ has 47 cards.

Substituting x = 47 into y = 3x,

y = 3 * 47 = 141

Smendrick has 141 cards.

Substituting x = 47 into z = 3x + 12,

z = 3 * 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

Becca has 153 cards.

The question asks for the number of cards Becca has and how many more than Smendrick she has.

Becca has 153 cards and she has 153 - 141 = 12 more cards than Smendrick.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the cost of shipping the book. The book weighs 4 pounds and the cost per pound is $0.35. So, the shipping cost for the weight of the book is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.

2. Next, let's calculate the cost of shipping based on the distance. The distribution center is 20 miles away and the cost per mile is $0.08. So, the shipping cost for the distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.

3. The total shipping cost is the sum of the weight-based cost and the distance-based cost. So, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

4. Now, let's calculate how much Milly will get back from Amazon. The book cost $32 and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount. So, the refund amount is 75% * $32 = $24.

5. Finally, let's calculate how much money Milly will lose. This is the total shipping cost minus the refund amount. So, the loss is $3.00 - $24 = $21.

                [/INST] Solution:

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan has after her father gave her $100. We know she initially had $40, so:

Total money = Initial money + Money from father
Total money = $40 + $100
Total money = $140

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the two pairs of jeans and the bag. The jeans cost $30 each and there are two pairs, so:

Total cost of jeans = Number of jeans * Price per jean
Total cost of jeans = 2 * $30
Total cost of jeans = $60

Now, add the cost of the bag to the total cost of the jeans to get the total cost of all items:

Total cost = Total cost of jeans + Cost of bag
Total cost = $60 + $20
Total cost = $80

Finally, subtract the total cost of the items from the total money to find out how much money Mulan has left:

Money left = Total money - Total cost
Money left = $140 - $80
Money left = $60

So, \boxed{60} dollars is the final answer.</s>","Mulan has a total of $40 + $100 = $<<40+100=140>>140.
Two pairs of jeans cost 2 x $30 = $<<2*30=60>>60.
Thus, Mulan spends a total of $60 + $20 = $<<60+20=80>>80.
Therefore, Mulan has $140 - $80 = $<<140-80=60>>60 left.

3. In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
4. In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production from the first three weeks:
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, the remaining production for the fourth week would be:
50,000 (total monthly production) - 36,000 (production from the first three weeks) = 14,000 bars.

Therefore, the cost for the additional mirrors is $15.00 \times 2 = $30.00$.

2. **Cost for Chandeliers**: Angela has 2 chandeliers, and the firm installs 1 chandelier for $129.00. Since Angela has 1 additional chandelier, the cost for installing this additional chandelier is calculated by multiplying the number of additional chandeliers by the extra charge per item, which is $15.00. Therefore, the cost for the additional chandelier is $15.00 \times 1 = $15.00$.

3. **Cost for Pictures**: Angela has 20 pictures, and the firm installs 10 pictures for $129.00. Since Angela has 10 additional pictures, the cost for installing these additional pictures is calculated by multiplying the number of additional pictures by the extra charge per item, which is $15.00. Therefore, the cost for the additional pictures is $15.00 \times 10 = $150.00$.

4. **Total Cost**: To find the total cost, we add the initial installation cost to the costs for the additional items. The initial installation cost is $129.00, and the costs for the additional items are $30.00 for mirrors, $15.00 for chandeliers, and $150.00 for pictures. Adding these together, we get $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $324.00$.

1. Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than his brother Anthony.
   Let's denote Roy's savings as R and Anthony's savings as A.
   So, R = A + 0.40A = 1.40A

2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than their sister Eva.
   Let's denote Eva's savings as E.
   So, A = E + $10.00

3. Eva has saved $20.00.
   So, E = $20.00

Now let's substitute the values into the equations:

4. A = E + $10.00
   A = $20.00 + $10.00
   A = $30.00

5. R = 1.40A
   R = 1.40 * $30.00
   R = $42.00

4. After the rest, Mason continues his journey for another 6 hours.
   Distance traveled in 6 hours = Speed * Time
   Distance = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles
5. To find the total distance he traveled, we add the distances from steps 2 and 4.
   Total distance = Distance in first 4 hours + Distance in last 6 hours

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as k, and the total length of the highway as L.

2. According to the problem, 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed of k together cover the length L in 18 hours. This means that the time taken by 1 kangaroo to cover the same distance would be the same, so it's 18 hours.

3. The speed of a kangaroo is k, and it takes 18 hours for it to cover the length L of the highway. So, we can write the speed as k = L / 18.

4. Now, let's consider the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of a turtle is k/2.

5. Following the same logic as before, if 4 turtles travel at this speed, the time taken for them to cover the length L of the highway would be the same as the time taken by 1 turtle.

6. So, if a turtle takes 18 hours to cover L at speed k/2, then 4 turtles would take the same amount of time to cover L at speed k/2/4 (which is again k/2, as they are moving at the same speed but in parallel).

7. Therefore, it will take 18 hours for four turtles to cover the length of the highway.

2. Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora.
3. Kora made 20 dishes.

First, let's find out how many dishes Rory made. Since Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory made 20 more than Kora, Rory must have made:

20 (Kora's dishes) + 20 = 40 dishes

Now, since Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, Jada must have made:

2 * 40 (Rory's dishes) = 80 dishes

Finally, to find out how many dishes they all made together, we simply add up the number of dishes each of them made:

20 (Kora's dishes) + 40 (Rory's dishes) + 80 (Jada's dishes) = 140 dishes

1. The new laptop Erika wants costs $600.

2. If she trades her old laptop, the price of the new laptop will be reduced by $200, making the new price $400 ($600 - $200).

3. Erika has been paid $150 this week for her part-time job.

4. Her mom agrees to give her $80 to help her.

5. Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

1. The total amount Erika has now is the price of the new laptop after the trade ($400), plus the money she has from her part-time job ($150), and the money her mom is giving her ($80). So, the total amount is $400 + $150 + $80.

2. Since Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount she has in her purse is the total amount calculated in the previous step minus the $50 she still needs.

3. Adam then eats 15 slices out of the total. The total number of slices made from both types of apples is 15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices.

4. After eating 15 slices, the number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten, which is 30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Craig starts with twenty dollar bills, and he has two of them. So, he initially has $20 * 2 = $40.

2. He buys six squirt guns for $2 each. The total cost of the squirt guns is $2 * 6 = $12.

3. He also buys three packs of water balloons for $3 each. The total cost of the water balloons is $3 * 3 = $9.

4. So, the total amount Craig spends is $12 + $9 = $21.

5. To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount he initially had. This gives us $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is {Craig has $19 left}.</s>","Craig starts off with 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.
Craig spends 6 squirt guns * $2 = $<<6*2=12>>12 on squirt guns.
Craig spends 3 packs of water balloons * $3 = $<<3*3=9>>9 on water balloons.
Total Craig has spent $12 + $9 = $<<12+9=21>>21.
Craig has $40 - $21 = $<<40-21=19>>19 remaining.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter has 60/2 = 30 dishes.
3. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. So, Jack has 2 times the number of socks he has dishes. Since he has 60 dishes, he has 60/2 = 30 socks.
4. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has 30*2 = 60 socks.
5. To find the total number of socks they have together, we add Jack's socks to Peter's socks: 30 + 60 = 90 socks.
6. To find the total number of dishes they have together, we add Jack's dishes to Peter's dishes: 60 + 30 = 90 dishes.
7. Finally, to find the total number of items (socks and dishes) they have together, we add the total number of socks to the total number of dishes: 90 + 90 = 180 items.

If she ? allows a ; 10-minute intermission, how , many groups can perform in the concert?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the total time one group needs to perform. This includes the 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, one group needs 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

2. Next, we need to consider the 10-minute intermission. This intermission time does not count towards the performance time, so we need to calculate the total available performance time by subtracting the intermission time from the total concert time. The total concert time is 2 hours, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. So, the total available performance time is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

3. Finally, to find out how many groups can perform, we divide the total available performance time by the time one group needs. So, the number of groups that can perform is 110 / 10 = 11 groups.

So, the final answer is \boxed{11}.</s>","First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
Of those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 – 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances.
Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.
Of the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total interest earned by Brenda after 3 years and then add it to the original investment.

Step 1: Calculate the interest rate
The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original amount, which means it's a percentage of the total amount.
3/4 * 100% = 75%
So, the interest rate is 75% per year.

Step 2: Calculate the interest earned per year
The interest earned each year is calculated by multiplying the interest rate by the principal (the original amount invested).
Interest per year = Principal * Interest rate
Interest per year = $300 * 0.75 = $225

Step 3: Calculate the total interest earned after 3 years
The total interest earned after 3 years is calculated by multiplying the interest earned per year by the number of years.
Total interest = Interest per year * Number of years
Total interest = $225 * 3 = $675

Step 4: Calculate the total amount after 3 years
The total amount after 3 years is calculated by adding the original amount to the total interest earned.
Total amount = Original amount + Total interest
Total amount = $300 + $675 = $975

{The final answer is $975}</s>","Three-quarters of $300 is (3/4)*$300 = $<<(3/4)*300=225>>225

   = 30 trays

2. Next, we need to calculate how much the farmer will earn if he sells each tray for $2.5.

Earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray

3. He sells twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats. So, the number of goats in Farm Y is now 45 - 20 = 25 goats.

4. To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats in Farm X and Farm Y, which is 45 + 25 = 70 goats.

\[2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year}\]

Next, to find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount he spends on shoes each year by the total number of pairs he buys in a year:

3. In the third year, they will double the total number of homes they have built after two years. So, they will build 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

4. To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we add the number of homes built in each year: 12 (first year) + 36 (second year) + 96 (third year) = 144 homes.

We are given the following information:

1. I am three years younger than my brother, so my age is B - 3.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is B - 3 - 2 = B - 5.
3. My mother's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so M = 3B - 1.
4. When you add all our ages, you get 87, so B + (B - 3) + (B - 5) + M = 87.

Now let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Substitute the expression of M in the equation, we get B + (B - 3) + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87.

Jackson need to buy so , every student can : have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole : packs and : he expects to have , some extra glue ! sticks left , over?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs for all his students. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 students * 2 glue sticks per student = 54 glue sticks.

2. Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Since each pack contains 8 glue sticks, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack. So, 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks per pack = 6.75 packs.

3. However, Mr. Jackson cannot buy a fraction of a pack. He needs to buy whole packs, so he will need to buy 7 packs to ensure every student can have 2 glue sticks.

\boxed{7}</s>","Mr. Jackson will need 27 x 2 = <<27*2=54>>54 glue sticks.
Divide the number of glue sticks by the amount in each pack, 54 / 8 = <<54/8=6.75>>6.75 packs.
Since Mr. Jackson must buy whole packs, you must round 6.75 up to the next highest whole number, 7.
Mr. Jackson must buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

1. Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.
2. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. So, the new amount of water is 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.
3. On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. So, the new amount of water is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the third day is 14000 gallons.

                [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that a plague infects ten people and each infected person infects six others every day. We need to find out how many people are infected after three days.

Step 2: Calculate the number of infections on the first day
On the first day, the ten initially infected people infect six others each. So, the total number of new infections on the first day is:
10 people * 6 new infections/person = 60 new infections

Step 3: Calculate the number of infections on the second day
On the second day, the 10 initial infections and the 60 new infections from the first day each infect six others. So, the total number of new infections on the second day is:
(10 + 60) people * 6 new infections/person = 420 new infections

Step 4: Calculate the number of infections on the third day
On the third day, the 10 initial infections, the 60 new infections from the first day, and the 420 new infections from the second day each infect six others. So, the total number of new infections on the third day is:
(10 + 60 + 420) people * 6 new infections/person = 2640 new infections

Step 5: Calculate the total number of infected people after three days
The total number of infected people after three days is the sum of the initially infected people and the new infections on each day:
10 initial infections + 60 first-day infections + 420 second-day infections + 2640 third-day infections = 3130 people

Final answer:
{The final answer is 3130 people}</s>","On the first day, the original ten people infect six people each, so 10 * 6 = <<10*6=60>>60 more people are infected.
There are 10 + 60 = <<10+60=70>>70 infected people after the first day.
On the second day, 70 * 6 = <<70*6=420>>420 more people are infected.
There are 70 + 420 = <<70+420=490>>490 infected people after the second day.

1. First, let's determine how much money Rafaela received in tips. Each of the 40 customers gave her $20 in tips. So, Rafaela received a total of 40 * $20 = $800 in tips.

2. Next, let's find out how much less money Julieta received in tips compared to Rafaela. She received 10% less money in tips, so we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips. 10% of $800 is ($800 * 10/100) = $80.

3. So, Julieta received $80 less in tips than Rafaela, which means she received $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

4. Finally, to find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals together: $800 + $720 = $1520.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Claire's Badges**: Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year, which has 12 months, Claire would earn 12 badges.

2. **Amber's Badges**: Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge. This means Amber earns 0.5 badges in the same time it takes Claire to earn 1 badge. However, the question might be implying that Amber earns badges at the same rate as Claire but takes twice the time to complete them, which would still be 1 badge per month. But since we are looking for the rate in which the badges are earned, we will assume Amber earns half a badge every month and thus, in a year, Amber would earn 6 badges.

3. **Wendy's Badges**: Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. This is 3 times 12, which equals 36 badges in a year.

4. **Comparison**: To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract Amber's total from Wendy's total. That's 36 (Wendy's badges) - 6 (Amber's badges).

Therefore, Wendy earns $36 - 6 = 30$ more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

{The final answer is $\boxed{30}$}.</s>","Claire earns 1 badge every month so over 12 months she earns 1*12 = <<1*12=12>>12 badges
It takes Amber twice as long as Claire to earn a badge so over 1 year she earns 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 badges
Wendy earns 3 times the amount of badges compared to Claire who earns 12 badges so over 1 year Wendy earns 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 badges
Wendy earns 36 badges while Amber earns 6 so Wendy has earned 36-6 = <<36-6=30>>30 more badges

1. First, we need to determine how many banana bread loaves Paige can bake in one hour. The problem states that she can bake 0.2 loaves every hour.

2. Next, we need to calculate how many loaves she can bake in total from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The time interval is 5 hours, so the total number of loaves is 0.2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 1 loaf.

3. Now, we know that each loaf is cut into 8 slices. So, the total number of slices from one loaf is 8 slices/loaf * 1 loaf = 8 slices.

4. Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is equivalent to $0.5 per slice. So, the total amount raised on each slice sold is $0.5/slice * 8 slices = $4.

                [/INST] Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as A. According to the information given, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can denote the number of books that Sofie has as A + 25. At the same time, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can denote the number of books that Fawn has as A + 12.

The total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

A (Anne's books) + A + 25 (Sofie's books) + A + 12 (Fawn's books) = 85

Combining the terms gives us:

3A + 37 = 85

To solve for A (Anne's books), we subtract 37 from both sides of the equation:

3A = 85 - 37
3A = 48

Finally, we divide both sides by 3 to find the number of books Anne has:

A = 48 / 3
A = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find out how many books Fawn has:

Fawn's books = A + 12
Fawn's books = 16 + 12
Fawn's books = 28

So the final answer to the problem, indicating the number of books Fawn has, is:

{Fawn has 28 books}</s>","Let x = the number of books Anne has.

1. Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 0.5 pounds.
2. The bag of sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes. So, the sweet potatoes weighed 2 * 0.5 = 1 pound.
3. The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, the carrots weighed 1 - 3 = -2 pounds, but weight can't be negative so there seems to be a mistake in the question.

If we assume that the weight of the sweet potatoes is 2 pounds (since it's more likely that the potatoes weigh 0.5 pounds than the sweet potatoes), then the bag of carrots would weigh 3 pounds fewer than 2 pounds, which is -1 pounds, still negative.

It seems there might be a mistake in the question as the information provided doesn't make sense. If we assume the weights are correct, then Daisy would have bought -2 pounds of carrots, which is not possible. If we correct the weights, then Daisy would have bought 0 pounds of carrots.

1. We know that one box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups.
2. Greg wants to make enough jello cups for 30 kids, and he wants each kid to have 4 jello cups.

So, the total number of jello cups Greg needs is 30 (kids) * 4 (jello cups per kid) = 120 jello cups.

3. Now we know that one box of jello makes 10 jello cups, so we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy to have enough jello cups for 120.

This is calculated by dividing the total number of jello cups needed by the number of jello cups one box makes. So, Greg needs to buy 120 (total jello cups) / 10 (jello cups per box) = 12 boxes of jello.

4. Finally, we need to find out how much Greg will spend on jello. The jello is currently on sale for $1.25 per box.

So, the total cost is calculated by multiplying the number of boxes Greg needs to buy by the cost per box. That's 12 (boxes) * $1.25 (cost per box) = $15.

Therefore, Greg will spend $15 on jello for his son's outdoor birthday party.

{The final answer is $15}</s>","There will be 30 kids and he wants each kid to have 4 servings so that's 30*4 = <<30*4=120>>120 jello cups
1 box of jello makes 10 jello cups and he needs to make 120 jello cups so he needs 120/10 = <<120/10=12>>12 boxes of jello
Each box of jello is $1.25 and he needs 12 boxes so he will spend 1.25*12 = $<<1.25*12=15.00>>15.00 on jello

                [/INST] The seller bought 5 phones, each costing $700. So first, we need to find out how much the seller spent on all the phones.

Cost of 1 phone = $700
Number of phones = 5

Total cost = Cost of 1 phone * Number of phones
= $700 * 5
= $3500

The seller initially gave the seller $4000 in dollar bills. After buying the phones, the seller will have some money left as a change. This change is the difference between the initial $4000 and the total cost of the phones.

Change = Initial money - Total cost
= $4000 - $3500
= $500

So, the seller will give back $500 in change.

Answer: \{boxed{500}\}</s>","The seller bought the 5 phones for $700 * 5 = $<<700*5=3500>>3500.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we'll break it down into several steps:

1. Determine the total cost Keenan pays for groceries each month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%.

2. Calculate Keenan's monthly cost by multiplying the total monthly expenditure by the percentage Keenan pays.

3. Determine Keenan's weekly expenditure by dividing the monthly cost by the number of weeks in a month.

Let's perform the calculations:

1. Keenan's monthly cost = Total monthly expenditure * Percentage Keenan pays
   Keenan's monthly cost = $400 * 0.4
   Keenan's monthly cost = $160

2. Keenan's weekly cost = Keenan's monthly cost / Number of weeks in a month

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of one bottle of soda:**
   Given that 7 bottles of soda cost $21, we can find the cost of one bottle of soda by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles.
   \[
   \text{Cost of one bottle of soda} = \frac{\text{Total cost of soda}}{7} = \frac{21}{7} = \$3
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of two bottles of water:**
   It's given that 4 bottles of water cost $8. To find the cost of one bottle of water, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles. Then, to find the cost of two bottles, we multiply by 2.
   \[
   \text{Cost of two bottles of water} = 2 \times \left(\frac{\text{Total cost of water}}{4}\right) = 2 \times \left(\frac{8}{4}\right) = \$4
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:**
   Now, we add the cost of 3 bottles of soda to the cost of 2 bottles of water.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3 \times \$3 + \$4 = \$9 + \$4 = \$13
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of David wanting to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is \$13.

So, the final answer is \boxed{\$13}.</s>","One bottle of soda costs $21.00/7 = $<<21/7=3.00>>3.00.

Total cost = Cost of one bolt * Number of bolts
Total cost = $0.03 * 16
Total cost = $0.48

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the bolts from David's original amount:
Original amount = $12.48
Total cost = $0.48

Money left = Original amount - Total cost
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

So, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts.

Next, we need to find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking at the same rate. To do this, we multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she plans to work:

Earnings after 12 hours = Hourly rate * Hours worked
= $11 per hour * 12 hours

\[3/5 \times 300 = 180\]

2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens: He sells each chicken for $50, so the total revenue from selling 180 chickens is:
\[180 \times 50 = \$9000\]

3. Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we subtract this amount from the total revenue to find out how much he spent on buying the chickens:

Sarah's friend paid $2 per meter for a 20-meter rope, so the total cost was 2 * 20 = $40.

Step 2: Calculate Sarah's profit from selling the rope.
Sarah bought the rope for $40 and sold it for $40, so her profit was 40 - 40 = $0. However, since the problem states that Sarah plans to use the profit to buy a new rope, we need to assume that she intended to sell the rope for more than the price she paid for it. Let's say she sold the rope for $50. Then her profit would be 50 - 40 = $10.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the new rope.
The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and Sarah wants to buy a 20-meter rope, so the total cost would be 1.5 * 20 = $30.

Step 4: Calculate how much money Sarah will have left after she buys the new rope.
Sarah has a profit of $10, and the new rope costs $30, so the amount of money she will have left is 10 - 30 = -$20.

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total cost of bacon packs.
Kelly has 5 packs of bacon which cost $10 in total. So, each pack costs $10 / 5 = $2.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of chicken packs.
Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet costs $2 * 2 = $4. She has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost is $4 * 6 = $24.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of strawberries.
Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and she has 3 packs. So, the total cost of strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of apples.
Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack costs $4 / 2 = $2. She has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost is $2 * 7 = $14.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of all items.
The total cost of all items is the sum of the cost of bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples. So, the total cost is $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Step 6: Calculate the remaining budget.
Kelly's budget is $65, and the total cost of all items is $60. So, she has $65 - $60 = $5 left in her budget.

The final answer is {The final answer is $5}.</s>","Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts. This means if her usual concert is X minutes long, her final concert would be 2X minutes long.

2. She also performs a 15-minute encore at the end of the concert. So, the total runtime of her final concert becomes 2X + 15 minutes.

3. According to the problem, her final concert is 65 minutes long. So, we can set up the equation: 2X + 15 = 65.

4. Solving for X, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2X = 50.

5. Then, we divide both sides by 2: X = 25.

So, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes each. {The final answer is 25 minutes.}</s>","The concert, minus the encore, lasted for 65-minute concert – 15-minute encore = <<65-15=50>>50 minutes.
This is twice as long as her usual concerts so her usual concert must have a runtime of 50 minutes / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

1. Argo starts with 200 toys.
2. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa.
3. He gives 80 toys to Bonnie.
4. He gives 30 toys to Nicky.

Now, let's calculate how many toys Argo has left after giving some to Alyssa, Bonnie, and Nicky:

Starting toys = 200
Toys given to Alyssa = 40
Toys given to Bonnie = 80
Toys given to Nicky = 30

Toys given away in total = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Remaining toys = Starting toys - Toys given away
                     = 200 - 150
                     = 50

So, Argo has {50} toys left.</s>","After Argo gives 40 toys to Alyssa, he remains with 200-40 =<<200-40=160>>160

1. On Tuesday, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas.
2. On Wednesday, they make 125/2 = 62.5 chimichangas. (Since it's not possible to make half a chimichanga, we can assume this is rounded down to the nearest whole number.)
3. On Friday, they make twice as many as on Wednesday, so 125 chimichangas * 2 = 250 chimichangas.

Adding these up, we get:

125 (Tuesday) + 62 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 437 chimichangas

So, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 437 chimichangas on those three days.

                [/INST] Let's reason through this problem step by step:

1. The singer has 50 microphones.
2. He wants to arrange them in pairs, which means each pair consists of 2 microphones.
3. He realizes that 20% of the microphones won't fit after arranging the rest in pairs.

Let's first find out how many microphones are affected by the 20% that won't fit:

Number of microphones that won't fit = Total number of microphones * Percentage that won't fit
= 50 * 0.2
= 10 microphones

Since these 10 microphones can't be arranged in pairs, they remain as individual microphones. This means the remaining microphones can be arranged in pairs.

Remaining microphones = Total number of microphones - Microphones that won't fit
= 50 - 10
= 40 microphones

Now, to find out how many pairs of microphones the singer can arrange, we divide the remaining microphones by 2:

Number of pairs = Remaining microphones / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20 pairs

Therefore, {The final answer is \boxed{20}} pairs of microphones were arranged on the stage.</s>","The number of microphones that were not able to find space on the stage is 20/100*50 = <<20/100*50=10>>10
This means the singer could set 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 microphones into pairs on the stage.
Since a pair has 2 microphones, the singer set up 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

- There is a fraction of birds flying overhead, but we don't know the exact number.
- There are 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of birds in the feeding groups.
- Each group has 8 birds, and there are 3 groups, so: 8 birds/group * 3 groups = 24 birds.

Step 3: Calculate the number of birds nesting in bushes and flying overhead.
- We know that 2/3rd of the birds nesting in bushes are also flying overhead.
- So, if there are 6 birds nesting in bushes, then 2/3rd of them are flying overhead: (2/3) * 6 birds = 4 birds.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of birds Jerry counts.
- Add the number of birds nesting in bushes, flying overhead, and the birds feeding: 6 birds + 4 birds + 24 birds = 34 birds.

2. Calculate the number of outdoor plants: Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. The remaining plants are left after we subtract the indoor plants from the total number of plants: 100 - 25 = 75 plants. So, the number of outdoor plants is (2/3) * 75 = 50 plants.

3. Calculate the number of flowering plants: The rest of the plants are flowering plants. So, we subtract the number of indoor and outdoor plants from the total number of plants: 100 - 25 (indoor plants) - 50 (outdoor plants) = 25 flowering plants.

4. Calculate the percentage of flowering plants: To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100% = 25%.

4. The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 (salad) + $3 (yogurt) = $9 each day.
5. The total amount Ellen spends on her goods (which include the carrots, salad, and yogurt) is $11.
6. Since the salad and yogurt cost $9 each day, the cost of the carrots is $11 (total cost) - $9 (cost of salad and yogurt) = $2 each day.
7. Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the price per carrot is $2 (total cost of carrots) / 2 (number of carrots) = $1 per carrot.

The following week, she ? mowed Alba's . lawn five . times ; as she did Joe's. If , Joe paid Tasha $6 for her , work, how much did ! she make from lemonade sales?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Tasha made $80 last month from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.

2. Let's denote the amount Tasha made from mowing lawns as M.

3. We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, but we don't know if this amount includes the money she made from mowing Joe's lawn or not. If it does, then we need to subtract it from the total amount she made from mowing lawns.

4. We also know that Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. However, we don't know the exact number of times she mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as J.

5. Therefore, the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5J.

6. The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns can be represented as M = 6 + 5J, where 6 is the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn if it's included in the $6 Joe paid her.

7. We don't know the exact number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn. Let's denote it as K.

8. We also know that she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she mowed Joe's lawn. So, K = 3J.

9. The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns can also be represented as M = 6 + K + 5J. However, since K = 3J, we can substitute K in the equation and get M = 6 + 3J + 5J = 6 + 8J.

10. Since Tasha made $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns, we can represent it as $80 = (amount from lemonade sales) + M.

11. We don't have enough information to determine the exact amount Tasha made from lemonade sales. However, if we assume that Joe paid Tasha $6 specifically for mowing his lawn and not for the total amount from mowing lawns, then we can calculate the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales as $80 - M = $80 - (6 + 8J).

12. Without knowing the value of J, we cannot calculate the exact amount Tasha made from lemonade sales.

\boxed{The final answer is: Tasha made $80 - (6 + 8J) from lemonade sales, where J is the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn.}</s>","At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars
Since the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.
Adding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars
Subtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars
Tasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.

1. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha initially. Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha initially had as M. So, Joseph had 3M notebooks.

2. Martha bought 5 more notebooks. So now she has M + 5 notebooks.

3. The total number of notebooks Martha now has is 7. So, M + 5 = 7. Solving for M, we get M = 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

4. So, initially, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, which means Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

5. Now, Martha has 7 notebooks. Joseph still has 6 notebooks.

6. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has. So, 7 - 6 = 1 notebook.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance Anis rowed and then add it to the distance Dijana rowed to get the total distance rowed by both of them on that day.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Anis rowed.
Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional distance Anis rowed by multiplying 50 by 1/5.

Additional distance = 50 * 1/5 = 10 miles

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. Therefore, Anis rowed a total of:

Total distance Anis rowed = Distance Dijana rowed + Additional distance
= 50 + 10 = 60 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total distance rowed by both of them.
Now, we add the distance rowed by Dijana to the distance rowed by Anis to get the total distance.

Total distance = Distance Dijana rowed + Distance Anis rowed
= 50 + 60 = 110 miles

So, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles.

3. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, to find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel:

1. Denise's total pages read (yesterday + today) = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.
2. Daniel's total pages read (yesterday + today) = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages Denise read than Daniel is 28 (Denise's total) - 13 (Daniel's total) = 15 pages.

1. Calvin has enough soup to fill four adult bowls or eight child bowls.
2. He is an adult and will be eating with his adult wife and their two children for dinner.
3. Everyone will eat one bowl of soup at the meal.

Now let's calculate how much soup is left for lunch:

a. Calvin and his wife will eat a total of three adult bowls for dinner.
b. The two children will eat two child bowls for dinner.
c. Since one child's bowl is equivalent to half an adult's bowl, the two children's bowls are equivalent to one adult's bowl.

Total leftover soup = Total soup - Soup eaten during dinner
                  = 4 adult bowls - 3 adult bowls - 1 adult's bowl (due to the equivalent of two child bowls)
                  = 4 - 3 - 1
                  = 0 adult bowls

However, the question asks for the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftovers. Since there are no leftovers, they cannot have any bowls for lunch.

{The final answer is: 0 times for each child.}</s>","Four adult bowls equal eight children’s bowls, so each adult bowl is 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 children’s bowls.
Calvin and his wife will eat two adult bowls, so they will eat the equivalent of 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 children’s bowls.
Thus, he, his wife, and their children will eat 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 children’s bowls at dinner.
After dinner, there will be 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 children’s bowls left over.
There are 2 children, so each child will be able to eat a bowl of leftover soup for lunch 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1 time.

   = $7.50

2. He also bought one ballpen at $0.5. So, the cost of the ballpen is:

1. First, let's understand the problem: Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material and 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. We need to find out how much material she would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

2. Let's calculate the material needed for the small masks: Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. So, the material needed for one small mask is 2 yards divided by 4, which is 0.5 yards.

3. Now, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks: Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. So, the material needed for one large mask is 2.25 yards divided by 3, which is 0.75 yards.

4. Now, let's calculate the total material needed for the 20 small masks: If one small mask requires 0.5 yards, then 20 small masks would require 0.5 yards times 20, which is 10 yards.

5. Finally, let's calculate the total material needed for the 8 large masks: If one large mask requires 0.75 yards, then 8 large masks would require 0.75 yards times 8, which is 6 yards.

6. Adding the material needed for both small and large masks gives us the total material needed: 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

For the small masks, it will take 20 masks x 0.5 yards = <<20*0.5=10>>10 yards of material.
For the large masks, it will take 8 masks x 0.75 yards = <<8*0.75=6>>6 yards of material.

1. Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

2. He uses 3/7 of his blue shoe boxes for fishing. To find out how many that is, we multiply 7 by 3/7:
   (3/7) * 7 = 3 blue shoe boxes

3. He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes for fishing. To find out how many that is, we multiply 9 by 1/3:
   (1/3) * 9 = 3 red shoe boxes

4. Now, we subtract the used shoe boxes from the total number of shoe boxes Tim had initially:
   Blue shoe boxes left = 7 (initial) - 3 (used) = 4
   Red shoe boxes left = 9 (initial) - 3 (used) = 6

5. To find the total number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box, we add the remaining red and blue shoe boxes together:

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We start with the information that Sarah has 9 books.

2. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books to begin with. So, originally, Joseph had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

3. Then, Joseph lost 2 books. To find out how many books Joseph has now, we subtract the number of books lost from the original number of books:
   Current number of books Joseph has = Original number of books - Number of books lost
   = 18 - 2
   = 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books. {The final answer is \boxed{16}.}</s>","Joseph used to have 9 books * 2 = <<9*2=18>>18 books.

                [/INST] Step 1: Dean initially has 30 marbles.

Step 2: He gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. To find out how many marbles that is, we calculate 1/5 of 30.
1/5 * 30 = 6

Step 3: After giving 6 marbles to Jamie, Dean still has 30 - 6 = 24 marbles.

Step 4: Dean then gives 10 marbles to Donald.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Find Duncan's age eight years ago**: Since Duncan is 60 years old now, eight years ago, he would have been 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

2. **Find Adam's age four years ago**: From the problem, we know that eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, if we let Adam's age four years ago be represented by 'A', we can write the equation: 52 = 2 * (A + 4).

3. **Solve for Adam's age four years ago**:
   - 52 = 2 * (A + 4)
   - Divide both sides by 2 to isolate (A + 4): 52 / 2 = A + 4
   - 26 = A + 4
   - Subtract 4 from both sides to solve for A: A = 26 - 4
   - A = 22

So, Adam was 22 years old four years ago.

4. **Find Adam's current age**:
   - If Adam was 22 years old four years ago, then his current age (in 4 years from four years ago) is 22 + 4 = 26 years old.

5. **Find Adam's age in 8 years**:
   - If Adam is currently 26 years old, then in 8 years, he will be 26 + 8 = 34 years old.

Therefore, the final answer, following the format you provided, is: {The final answer is Adam will be 34 years old in 8 years}.</s>","Eight years ago, Duncan was 60-8 = 52 years old, the same as Adam's age four years ago.
Therefore, four years ago, Adam's age was 52/2 =<<52/2=26>>26 years.
Currently, Adam is 26+4 = <<26+4=30>>30 years old.
In 8 years from now, Adam will be 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.

3. Calculating Farmer Smith's farm size: (2 * 200) + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

4. Now, to find the total acres of both farms together, we add the acres of Farmer Brown's farm and Farmer Smith's farm: 200 + 500.

1. Colby completes packages per hour. Since he completes 10 less than 50 packages, we can express this as:
   Packages per hour = 50 - 10 = 40 packages

2. Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. So, his hourly rate is:
   Hourly rate = $0.20 * 40 = $8 per hour

3. Now, we need to calculate his earnings in an eight-hour workday:
   Earnings in a workday = Hourly rate * Hours worked per day
   Earnings in a workday = $8 * 8 = $64

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{64}.</s>","Ten less than fifty is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 packages per hour.

                [/INST] Let's denote the amount of allowance each girl received as A.

The total amount of money they have when they combine their allowances is 2A (since both Julia and Nadine contributed).

The cake costs $11, so they spent $11 from their combined allowance.

They also bought 1 dozen balloons, which are sold for $0.5 each for 2 balloons. Since a dozen is 12 balloons, they need to buy 6 sets of 2 balloons. So, the total cost for the balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.

The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. So, the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $11 (for the cake) + $3 (for the balloons) + $14 (for the ice cream) = $28.

So, 2A - $28 = 0 (since they spent all their money).

Solving for A, we get 2A = $28, so A = $14.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

\boxed{The final answer is \$14}</s>","There are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pairs of balloons in 1 dozen.

1. The class has 30 students.
2. Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops.
3. Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
4. Each lollipop cost the class $0.5 to buy.

First, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:

Revenue = Number of students * Average lollipops sold per student * Price per lollipop
Revenue = 30 * 10 * $0.8
Revenue = $240

Next, we calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:

Cost = Number of students * Average lollipops sold per student * Cost per lollipop
Cost = 30 * 10 * $0.5
Cost = $150

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Revenue - Cost
Profit = $240 - $150
Profit = $90

{The final answer is: The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.}</s>","The class got $0.8 - $0.5 = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3 profit from each lollipop.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to determine how many slices Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby can eat 2 slices a day, Josh can eat 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

2. Next, we need to find out how many slices are eaten in total by both Abby and Josh in one day. This is 2 (Abby's slices) + 4 (Josh's slices) = 6 slices in total per day.

3. Finally, to find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we divide the total number of slices (24) by the total number of slices eaten per day (6). So, 24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days.

{The final answer is 4 days}.</s>","Josh can eat 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 slices a day.
Together, Abby and Josh can eat 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 slices a day.

                [/INST] The question asks for the total number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday. Since she has been collecting shells every month since she turned 5 years old, we can calculate the total number of shells as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of months Martha has been collecting shells:
   - Since she has been collecting shells since she turned 5 years old and will continue until she turns 10, we have 5 years.
   - To find out how many months this is, we multiply the number of years by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).
   - So, the total number of months she has been collecting shells is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

2. Since she collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is equal to the total number of months she has been collecting.

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.</s>","In 12 months of the year, Martha collects 12 * 1 = <<12*1=12>>12 shells.
From her 5th to her 10th birthday, 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 years have passed.
During the 5 years that have passed, Martha has collected 12 * 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 shells.

                [/INST] The problem seems to have some missing or unclear information, which makes it difficult to solve accurately. However, based on the information provided, we can attempt to solve it by making some assumptions or filling in the gaps.

Assumption: Let's assume that by ""divides these into; 3 rows"" it means Lana divides the cups into three equal rows. Also, ""She then, uses the remaining cups to ? brew a total of . 15 cups of cinnamon : tea"" seems to indicate that there are 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

If Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows, then each row would initially have 27 / 3 = 9 cups. Since the cups in each row are used for chamomile and mint tea, we assume that each row has an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea. So, there are 9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of each type of tea in each row.

Now, Lana uses 15 cups of the remaining cups to brew cinnamon tea, leaving 27 - 15 = 12 cups for chamomile and mint tea. This means that each row initially had 12 / 3 = 4 cups in total for chamomile and mint tea. Since each row has 4 cups for both types of tea, and there are 4.5 cups of each type of tea in each row, it means that each row has 4.5 - 4 = 0.5 cups of mint tea.

{The final answer is: Lana has 0.5 cups of mint tea in each row.}</s>","If there are 15 cups of cinnamon tea, then there are a total of 27 – 15 = <<27-15=12>>12 cups of chamomile or mint tea.
As there are equal amounts of chamomile tea and mint tea, there is a total of 12 cups / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cups of mint tea.
Dividing these into rows shows that each row holds 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 cups of mint tea.

                    . A three-toed ; sloth moves very slowly, . and , only eats when he ; is up in ! his ; tree. ,  For a meal of ; berries, it takes the ; sloth 4 hours to make the trip ! down the tree, pick up berries, and ; climb back up into his : tree. :  Assuming ; he picks the same number of , berries on each trip, what is the least number ; of : berries he can pick : up per trip , down to the ! ground if he wants ! to collect ; 24 berries in : 8 , hours?
                [/INST] {The final answer is 75 berries per trip}

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. We know that it takes the sloth 4 hours for one round trip (down the tree, picking berries, and climb back up).
2. So, in 8 hours, the sloth can make 2 trips (8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips).
3. The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.
4. Therefore, the sloth needs to collect 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.
5. However, he can't pick berries while he's still down on the ground because he can only eat when he's up in his tree.
6. After each trip, he climbs back up to eat the berries he picked on the previous trip, so he can only pick a new set of berries every other trip.
7. Therefore, he needs to pick a number of berries that is enough for two trips (since he eats after each trip and picks new berries on every other trip).
8. So, in his first trip, he picks 12 berries for his immediate consumption, and in his second trip, he picks 2 x 12 = 24 berries (since he picked no berries on his second trip).
9. In total, he picks 12 + 24 = 36 berries, but he can only pick berries on every other trip.
10. So, the least number of berries he can pick per trip is 36 berries / 2 trips = 18 berries per trip.

There's a catch, though: if he picks 18 berries per trip, he will have picked 36 berries after two trips, which is exactly what he needs. But we're looking for a number that allows him to pick a different number of berries on each trip (so that he can have more on one trip and fewer on the next, for example).

11. Let's try picking 75 berries per trip:
    - On the first trip, he picks the 75 berries and eats them immediately.
    - On the second trip, he picks an additional 15 berries.
12. In total, he picks 75 + 15 = 90 berries, which is more than what he needs (24 berries).
13. However, he can eat the additional 15 berries and still be within his goal of 24 berries.

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick per trip is 75 berries.</s>","If one trip is 4-hours long, in 8 hours he can make 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 trips.
To collect 24 berries per 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 berries per trip.

3. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, and after 6 days, the tank will have been emptied for a total of 6 * 500 = 3000 gallons.
4. To find out how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the amount of water that has been emptied from the tank's initial amount: ?/2 - 3000.

So, the final answer, after 6 days, there will be ?/2 - 3000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.</s>","The water pump takes 1/2 *10000 = <<5000=5000>>5000 gallons of the pool's water into the tank.

1. Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, and 8 movies on other days. This totals to 5 + 8 = 13 movies so far.

2. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night, which costs $8 (popcorn) + $2 (candy) = $10.

3. The remaining money he has for the month is $150 - $2 (1 tub of popcorn) - $8 (5 movies) - $2 (2 boxes of candy) = $150 - $10 = $140.

4. If he spends the remaining money on tickets, he can see $140 / $10 (ticket price for Friday or Saturday) = 14 more movies on Friday or Saturday.

5. Since he wants to see movies on Friday or Saturday, he can see a total of 5 (already seen) + 14 = 19 movies on Friday or Saturday.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of calories in the cinnamon rolls. Each normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and there are 200 mini cinnamon rolls. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal one, each mini cinnamon roll has:

(1/3) * 600 = 200 calories

So, the total number of calories in the cinnamon rolls is:

200 * 200 = 40,000 calories

Next, let's calculate the total number of calories in the blueberry muffins. Each normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and there are 300 mini blueberry muffins. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal one, each mini blueberry muffin has:

(1/3) * 450 = 150 calories

So, the total number of calories in the blueberry muffins is:

300 * 150 = 45,000 calories

Finally, let's add the total number of calories in the cinnamon rolls and the blueberry muffins to get the total number of calories in all the pastries:

So, the pastries Andrew baked have {The final answer is} 85,000 calories.</s>","First find the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll: 600 calories / 3 = <<600/3=200>>200 calories

3. On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which means 78 Junebugs again.
4. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
5. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, to find the total number of Junebugs Rita removed over the five days, we add up all these numbers:
39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday) + 78 (Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 310 Junebugs in total.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number by the number of days:

P + (J + 10) + J = 100
P + 2J + 10 = 100
P + 2J = 90 ... (Equation 4)

Now, substitute Q in Equation 3:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, Equation 4 becomes:
2J + 10 + 2J = 90
4J + 10 = 90
4J = 80
J = 20

Now that we have John's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = 2J + 10
P = 2*20 + 10
P = 40 + 10
P = 50

So, Peter's age is 50 years.

{The final answer is \boxed{50}}</s>","Let x be the age of John. Paul’s age is x + 10
Peter’s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10
We have (2x + 10) + (x + 1) + x = 100
Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100
Subtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.
John is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old.

1. Maria initially gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so she gave out a total of 4 * 2 = 8 water balloons.

2. She also had 1 water balloon for herself.

3. Maria's mom then gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there were 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), Maria's mom gave out 5 * 3 = 15 balloons.

4. Therefore, the total number of balloons that the girls had was the sum of the balloons Maria initially gave out, the balloons Maria had for herself, and the balloons Maria's mom gave out. So, the total number of balloons is 8 + 1 + 15 = 24 balloons.

1. The charity group has 10 people donating 5 boxes of stuff each. So, the total number of boxes from the donations is 10 * 5 = 50 boxes.
2. They already have 10 boxes of stuff that they are bringing to the yard sale. So, the total number of boxes they have is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.
3. They can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table. So, the total number of tables they need to fit all their boxes is 60 / 2 = 30 tables.
4. They already have 15 tables. So, the number of new tables they need is 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

So, the charity group needs {15} new tables for the yard sale.</s>","There were 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 donated boxes

                [/INST] To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance each person spat their seeds and then find the average of these two distances.

Step 1: Calculate Zoey's total distance.
Zoey spits each of her 40 seeds 10 feet. So, her total distance is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Step 2: Calculate Sydney's total distance.
Sydney spits each of her 35 seeds 12 feet. So, her total distance is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Step 3: Calculate the average total distance.
The average total distance is the sum of the total distances divided by the number of distances. Here, there are two distances (one for each person). So, the average total distance is (400 feet + 420 feet) / 2 = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

\boxed{410 feet} is the average total distance spat.</s>","Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = <<40*10=400>>400

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the revenue generated by each machine and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the revenue generated by the Widgeteer 3000 in a day. It produces 60 widgets an hour, so in a day (24 hours), it produces:
 Widgets per day = Widgets per hour * Hours per day
                 = 60 * 24
                 = 1440 widgets

The price per widget is $6, so the revenue in a day from the Widgeteer 3000 is:
 Revenue per day = Widgets per day * Price per widget
                = 1440 * $6
                = $8,640

Now, let's calculate the revenue generated by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a day. It produces 45 widgets an hour, so in a day (24 hours), it produces:
 Widgets per day = Widgets per hour * Hours per day
                 = 45 * 24
                 = 1,080 widgets

The price per widget is $6, so the revenue in a day from the WidgetMaster 9000 is:
 Revenue per day = Widgets per day * Price per widget
                = 1,080 * $6
                = $6,480

Now, let's calculate the monthly revenue for each machine. There are 30 days in a month, so:
 Monthly revenue of Widgeteer 3000 = Revenue per day * Days in a month
                                   = $8,640 * 30
                                   = $259,200

 Monthly revenue of WidgetMaster 9000 = Revenue per day * Days in a month
                                      = $6,480 * 30
                                      = $194,400

Finally, let's calculate the difference in revenue between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000:
 Difference in revenue = Monthly revenue of Widgeteer 3000 - Monthly revenue of WidgetMaster 9000
                       = $259,200 - $194,400
                       = $64,800

So, Fern will make $64,800 more if she chooses the Widgeteer 3000 over the WidgetMaster 9000.

{The final answer is: $64,800}</s>","First find how many more widgets the Widgeteer 3000 makes per hour: 60 widgets/hour - 45 widgets/hour = <<60-45=15>>15 widgets/hour
Then multiply that difference by the number of hours in a day to find the daily difference: 15 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = <<360=360>>360 widgets/day
Then multiply the daily difference by the number of days in a month to find the monthly difference: 360 widgets/day * 30 days/month = <<360*30=10800>>10,800 widgets/month
Then multiply that number by the cost per widget to find the total earnings difference: 10,800 widgets/month * $6/widget = $<<10800*6=64800>>64,800

                [/INST] First, let's understand the cost structure for the hotel stay. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay and 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. The cost of an additional hour after the first 12 hours is 70 pesos.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for 17 hours.

If Cameron decides to pay for the 24-hour stay, he would pay 1600 pesos.

However, if he decides to pay for 12 hours and then add 70 pesos for every additional hour, the cost would be as follows:

Cost for first 12 hours = 1000 pesos
Additional hours = 17 - 12 = 5 hours
Cost for additional hours = 5 * 70 = 350 pesos

So, the total cost if Cameron opted for the second option would be = 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos

Now, let's compare the two scenarios to find out how much Cameron would save:

Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost under the second option
= 1600 - 1350
= 250 pesos

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by opting for the second option.

The final answer is {250 pesos}.</s>","12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.
If Cameron wants to leave at 10 am, he must pay for an additional 10 am - 5 am = <<10-5=5>>5 hours.
This means that he must pay an additional 70 pesos x 5 hours = <<70*5=350>>350 pesos.
Altogether, he must pay 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = <<1000+350=1350>>1350 pesos.
Therefore, he will save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = <<1600-1350=250>>250 pesos.

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs.
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. So, twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 5 = 10 pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of hay Nate needs for the goats.
There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. So, 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay are needed for the goats.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of hay Nate needs for the sheep.
There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay. So, 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay are needed for the sheep.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of hay Nate needs.
To get the total amount of hay Nate needs, add the amount needed for the goats and the amount needed for the sheep. So, 75 (for the goats) + 84 (for the sheep) = 159 pounds of hay.

Final answer: {The final answer is 159 pounds of hay}.</s>","First figure out how much hay each sheep needs: 5 pounds * 2 - 3 = <<5*2-3=7>>7 pounds/sheep

                [/INST] First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week.

John's weekly earnings = Hourly rate * Hours worked
= $50 * 6
= $300

Next, we need to calculate how much money John has left after spending on gas and depositing in the bank.

Money left = Total earnings - Gas - Bank deposit
= $300 - $50 - $100
= $150

Now, let's calculate how much money John spends on pencils.

Cost of pencils = Number of pencils * Cost per pencil
= 5 * $10
= $50

Subtract the cost of pencils from the money John has left to find out how much he has to spend on pens.

Money left after pencils = Money left - Cost of pencils
= $150 - $50
= $100

Finally, let's calculate how many pens John can buy with the remaining money.

Number of pens = Money left after pencils / Cost per pen
= $100 / $25
= 4

So, \boxed{4} pens can he buy after he buys 5 pencils.</s>","He earned $50*6=$<<50*6=300>>300

Let's break it down:

1. Each row contains 8 children.
2. There are 7 rows in each row.
3. There are 5 different schools participating.

So, the total number of children can be calculated as follows:

Each student is given 2 bottles of apple juice to drink for lunch. Since there are 29 students, the total number of bottles given out is:

2 bottles/student * 29 students = 58 bottles

Subtracting the bottles given out from the initial number, we get the number of bottles left for the teacher:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. James bought 10 CDs, each costing $15. So the total cost without any discount would be 10 * $15 = $150.

2. He got a 40% discount on these CDs. So the discount amount is 40% of $150. To find this, we calculate (0.4 * $150) = $60.

3. Therefore, the actual amount James spent is the original cost minus the discount, which is $150 - $60 = $90.

4. He then sold 5 CDs, which he didn't like, for $40 each. So he earned 5 * $40 = $200 from these sales.

5. Now, to find out how much money James was out, we subtract the money he earned from selling the 5 CDs from the amount he spent initially. So, $200 - $90 = $110.

Therefore, James was out $110. {The final answer is $110}.</s>","He got a 15*.4=$<<15*.4=6>>6 discount on each CD

   - Yams: 6 * $1.5 = $9
   - Sweet potatoes: 10 * $2 = $20
   - Carrots: 4 * $1.25 = $5

2. Now, let's add up the earnings from all types of root crops:

                [/INST] First, let's determine the distance James swims before stopping at the island. He swims 60% of the total distance, which is 20 miles * 0.6 = \boxed{12} miles.

Next, we need to find the time it takes him to swim this distance at a speed of 2 miles per hour. Time can be calculated using the formula time = distance / speed. So, the swimming time is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = \boxed{6} hours.

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. Therefore, the resting time is 6 hours * 0.5 = \boxed{3} hours.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes him to finish the remaining distance at half his original speed. The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = \boxed{8} miles.

His original speed was 2 miles per hour, so half of this speed is 2 miles per hour * 0.5 = \boxed{1} mile per hour.

Using the formula time = distance / speed again, the time to finish the remaining distance is 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

Finally, to find the total time it takes James to get across the lake, we add the swimming time, resting time, and the time to finish the remaining distance. So, the total time is 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = \boxed{17} hours.</s>","He swam 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 miles.
That took him 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 hours.

He then swam the remaining 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8 miles.
His pace was 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 mph.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we start with the information given and work step by step to find the final answer.

1. We are told that the bakery has .40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday.
2. Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.
3. To find out how many loaves the bakery has, we first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had: $7 \times 70 = 490$.
4. Then, we subtract .40 to find the number of loaves the bakery has: $490 - .40 = 489.6$.
5. However, since the number of loaves must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate our calculation. The correct interpretation in this context would be to understand that the bakery has .40 fewer loaves than seven times the number Sam has, not exactly 7 times minus .40. So, we correctly calculate $7 \times 70 = 490$ and then subtract 7 (not .40) because the problem indicates a difference in terms of loaves, not a fractional part of a loaf.
6. Therefore, the correct calculation is $490 - 7 = 483$.

The bakery has $\boxed{483}$ loaves of bread.</s>","If Sam had seventy loaves of bread last Friday, seven times that number is 7*70 = 490 loaves.

The total points scored by all three of them is 45, so we can set up the following equation:

x (Azibo's score) + x + 20 (Bahati's score) + x + 10 (Dinar's score) = 45

Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. We know that the book is 1.5 inches thick and there are 100 pages per inch.
2. To find the total number of pages, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book.

Total pages = Number of pages per inch * Thickness of the book
= 100 pages * 1.5 inches
= 150 pages

However, we need to consider that each page is printed on both sides of the paper. So, each page counts as two in terms of thickness.

3. To account for this, we divide the total number of pages by 2.

Actual pages in the book = Total pages / 2
= 150 pages / 2
= 75 pages

But we haven't considered whether the first page is counted. If the first page is counted, then we need to add 1 to our result.

4. If the first page is counted, then the final answer is:

2. We convert these hours into minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.
3. Now, we divide the total minutes by 15 (the time it takes to staple 30 reports) to find out how many groups of 30 reports Vince can staple within this time frame. So, 900 minutes / 15 minutes/group = 60 groups.
4. Finally, we multiply the number of groups by the number of reports per group to find out the total number of reports Vince can staple. So, 60 groups * 30 reports/group = 1800 reports.

Kim goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. That's 8 hours of sleep, which is equivalent to 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how many minutes Kim slept that day.

She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours, or 480 minutes. However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual due to sleepwalking. This means she slept for 5 minutes less than usual.

So, the number of minutes she slept that day is 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

But she also slept from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. That's 23 minutes of sleepwalking, which we need to subtract from her total sleep time.

                [/INST] This problem seems to be a bit convoluted with missing information and strange symbols. However, I will do my best to break it down step by step.

1. ""Jonathan has 2/3 as many spoons as measuring cups."" This suggests that for every ""x"" measuring cups, Jonathan has 2/3 * x spoons.

2. ""He has 2 dozen cups"" and ""Pedro 6 measuring spoons for his birthday"". It seems like Jonathan gave Pedro 6 spoons, but the number of spoons Jonathan initially had is not clear.

3. ""Calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining."" This is the final question.

Given the lack of clear information, I'll make an assumption that the symbols are placeholders for actual numbers and that the problem is trying to ask: ""If Jonathan had 2 * 24 measuring cups (2 dozen cups) and 6 measuring spoons were a 1/3 portion given to Pedro, how many measuring spoons does Jonathan have left?"" (This is a very big assumption, but I cannot solve the problem without it).

Step 1: Calculate the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially had.
Jonathan initially had 2/3 * 24 cups = 16 spoons [Assuming the initial spoons were equal to the number of cups].

Step 2: Calculate the remaining number of measuring spoons.
Jonathan gave 6 spoons to Pedro, so he now has 16 - 6 = 10 spoons.

Therefore, assuming the above interpretation, Jonathan has 10 spoons and 24 cups remaining, which is 34 utensils in total. However, without clear information, this interpretation can only be considered as a possibility.

{The final answer is: 34 utensils}.</s>","A dozen measuring cups are 12, and if Jonathan has two dozens, he has 2*12 = 24 cups.
Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, so he has 2/3*24 = <<2/3*24=16>>16 measuring spoons.
When he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he remains with 16-6 = <<16-6=10>>10 measuring spoons.
He now has a total of 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = <<10+24=34>>34 utensils

                [/INST] There are 1000 beds in the hospital and 1/5 of them are occupied. So initially, there are 1000 - (1000/5) = 1000 - 200 = 800 unoccupied beds.

Each day, 50 patients are admitted, so after 1 day, there are 800 - 50 = 750 unoccupied beds.

There are 2 weeks in total, and there are 7 days in a week, so there are 2*7 = 14 days.

After 14 days, there will be 750 - (50*14) = 750 - 700 = 50 unoccupied beds.

{The final answer is 50 unoccupied beds.}</s>","If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.
If 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.
After two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.

1. Robyn sends 16 emails a day.
2. Out of these, 7 are work emails.
3. This means the remaining emails (16 - 7 = 9) are for either her family or her boyfriend.
4. Two-thirds of these remaining emails (9) are sent to her family. So, 9 * (2/3) = 6 emails are sent to her family.
5. Therefore, the remaining one-third of the 9 emails are sent to her boyfriend.

1. The age of Shawna's father in terms of Shawna's age can be written as S_f = 5S, where S_f represents Shawna's father's age and S represents Shawna's age.
2. We are also given that Shawna's age can be expressed as A = 3 Aliya_a, where Aliya_a represents Aliya's age, which is given as 3 years.
3. To find Shawna's age, we first need to find Aliya's age, which is given as 3 years.
4. Now that we have Aliya's age, we can find Shawna's age using the given information: Shawna's age (S) = 3 Aliya's age (3 years) = 9 years.
5. Finally, we can find Shawna's father's age using the first equation: S_f = 5S = 5 * 9 years = 45 years.

                [/INST] If Kelly's statement is accurate, then Courtney's count is 20% more than the actual number of attendees. This means we need to reduce Courtney's count by 20% to find the actual number of attendees.

First, let's calculate 20% of the number of attendees Courtney counted:

20% of 48 = (20/100) * 48 = 0.2 * 48 = 9.6

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. In this case, it would be 10.

So, Courtney overstated the number of people by 10.

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:

48 - 10 = 38

So, The final answer is: 38 people really attended the concert.</s>","Since she overstated the number by 20%, 48 is 20% greater than the actual number i.e. 48 = 100% + 20% = 120% of the actual number = 120/100 of the actual number
Therefore, the actual number = (100/120)*48 = <<(100/120)*48=40>>40

1. We know that Jason carried 2 balls.
2. Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.
3. And if Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, then Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

1. On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.
2. By the end of the first day, there were 10 holes.
3. On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
4. So, after the second day, there were 10 + 13 = 23 holes.
5. On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes because the pirates kept falling in.
6. Therefore, on the third day, the number of holes changed by 8 - 2 = 6 holes.
7. So, after the third day, there were 23 + 6 = 29 holes.
8. The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day.
9. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes.
10. Therefore, after the fourth day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes.
11. On the fourth day, they dug the difference between the number of holes after the third day and the number of holes after the fourth day, which is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

1. We know that Jen has to travel to 3 different countries.
2. The cost of supplies is $400 for the whole journey.
3. The cost of tickets for travel is 50% more than the cost of supplies.

To find the cost of travel tickets, we need to increase the cost of supplies by 50%.

The formula for calculating 50% increase is:
New Value = Original Value + (Original Value * 50%)

So, we can calculate the cost of travel tickets as follows:
Travel Tickets = Supplies Cost + (Supplies Cost * 50%)
Travel Tickets = $400 + ($400 * 0.5)
Travel Tickets = $400 + $200
Travel Tickets = $600

So, the cost of travel tickets is $600.

To simplify, the question asks for the total cost of travel, which is the same as the cost of travel tickets. Therefore, the answer is $600.

- Alex captured A Pokemon
- Stan captured S Pokemon
- Adelwolfe captured D Pokemon

From the problem, we can write down the following equations:

1. Together, they have captured 339 Pokemon:
   A + S + D = 339

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   A = S + 5

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times the number Adelwolfe has caught:
   S = 4D - 13

Now let's substitute the expressions for A and S from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

(S + 5) + S + D = 339
2S + D = 334

Substitute the expression for S from equation 3 in the above equation:

2(4D - 13) + D = 334
8D - 26 + D = 334
9D = 360

Now divide by 9 to find the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught:

D = 360 / 9
D = 40

Now that we know the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught, we can find the number of Pokemon Stan has caught by substituting D back into the equation for S:

S = 4D - 13
S = 4*40 - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

1. First, let's calculate the distance the bird flew in the southerly direction. The bird flew for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. So, the distance in the southerly direction is 10 hours * 30 miles per hour = 300 miles.

2. Next, let's calculate the distance the bird flew in the northerly direction. The bird flew for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. So, the distance in the northerly direction is 2 hours * 18 miles per hour = 36 miles.

3. Then, the bird changed direction and flew towards the south again for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. So, the distance in the southerly direction (again) is 5 hours * 22 miles per hour = 110 miles.

4. To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we subtract the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south. So, the total distance is (300 miles + 110 miles) - 36 miles = 374 miles.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had at the beginning of the day. A dozen is equal to 12, so a half dozen is 6. Greta made one dozen for herself and received an additional half dozen at her office, which gives us a total of 18 brownies so far.

Then, she received 4 dozens more from her friends, which is 48 brownies. Adding the 18 she already had gives us a total of 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozens (or 18) brownies were eaten. So, to find out how many brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the eaten brownies from the total number of brownies she had.

66 (total brownies) - 18 (eaten brownies) = 48 brownies

Therefore, Greta had {48} individual brownies left over from the entire day.</s>","Her office sent her home with a 1/2 dozen brownies so she had 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 individual brownies
Her friends had 4 dozen brownies and 1 1/2 dozen were eaten so 4-1.5 = <<4-1.5=2.5>>2.5 dozen brownies left
She made 1 dozen brownies and had 2.5 dozen left from the party so 1+2.5 = <<1+2.5=3.5>>3.5 dozen brownies
Every dozen is 12 and she has 3.5 dozen so she has 12*3.5 = <<12*3.5=42>>42 individuals brownies
She has 42 individual brownies plus the 6 individual brownies sent home from work so she has a total of 42+6 = <<42+6=48>>48 individual brownies

1. Nani is 8 years old.
2. His brother is twice his age, so he's 8 * 2 = 16 years old.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find how much younger she is, we calculate 25% of Nani's age: 25% of 8 is 2.
4. So, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = \boxed{6 years old}.
5. Finally, to find the total age of all three family members, we add their ages together: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = \boxed{30 years}. {The final answer is 30 years}.</s>","Nani's brother is 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 years old.
Nani's sister is 25/100 * 8 = <<25/100*8=2>>2 years younger than he is.

                [/INST] Andy has a total of 12 racquets to string. The time it takes to string each type of racquet is as follows:

- Synthetic gut takes 15 minutes per racquet.
- Polyester string takes 22 minutes per racquet.
- Hybrid set takes 18 minutes since it's half and half of synthetic gut and polyester string, so it's an average of the two.

Let's calculate the time for each type:

1. Synthetic gut: There are 3 racquets, and it takes 15 minutes each.
Time = 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes

2. Polyester string: There are 5 racquets, and it takes 22 minutes each.
Time = 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes

3. Hybrid set: There are 4 racquets, and it takes 18 minutes each.
Time = 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, let's add up the time for all of the racquets:
Total time = 45 minutes (synthetic gut) + 110 minutes (polyester) + 72 minutes (hybrid)

Total time = 227 minutes

So, the final answer is that it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all of the racquets.</s>","Andy is stringing 3 racquets with synthetic gut, so those will take 3 synthetic gut jobs * 15 minutes per synthetic gut job = <<3*15=45>>45 minutes.

                [/INST] To calculate the total amount John paid for the phones, we can break down the problem into the following steps:

1. Determine the cost of the first phone. Since the price of the phone is $600, we have that the first phone costs $600.

2. Determine the cost of each phone after the first. Since each phone after the first is half price, we have that the cost of each phone after the first is $600 / 2 = $$300.

3. Determine the total number of phones. John buys a phone for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, so he buys a total of 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 phones.

4. Determine the cost of the first phone and the remaining phones. Since the first phone costs $600, and the remaining 3 phones cost $300 each, the total cost of the last 3 phones is 3 \* $300 = $900.

5. Determine the total cost of all phones. Since the cost of the first phone is $600, and the cost of the last 3 phones is $900, we have that John paid a total of $600 + $900 = $1500 for them all.

Therefore, the final answer is { \boxed{1500} }.</s>","He bought 1+2+1=<<1+2+1=4>>4 phones

1. First, we need to find out how many players are in Zeke's team. The problem states that Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's. Carlton's team has 13 players. So, the number of players in Zeke's team is 13 (in Carlton's team) + 7 (more players) = 20 players.

2. Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we simply add the number of players in Zeke's team (20 players) and the number of players in Carlton's team (13 players). So, the total number of players in both teams is 20 (Zeke's team) + 13 (Carlton's team) = 33 players.

   P = 2*(15 + 10) = 2*(25) = 50 feet

2. Determine the number of slats needed per foot of fencing:
   According to the problem, Robert needs 2 slats for every foot of fencing.

3. Calculate the total number of slats needed:
   Multiply the total perimeter by the number of slats required per foot:
   Total slats = Perimeter * Slats per foot = 50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats

The final answer is \boxed{100} slats.</s>","A rectangle has 2 long sides and Robert wants them to be 15 feet long so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 feet long

- Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
- She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.
- She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so she kept 12 * 1/4 = 3 boxes.
- She sold the rest of the oranges.

Now, let's calculate how many boxes she sold:

- She had 12 boxes initially and gave away 4, so she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.
- She kept 3 boxes, so she sold 8 - 3 = 5 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, we can calculate how many oranges she sold:

- She sold 5 boxes and each box contains 20 oranges, so she sold 5 * 20 = 100 oranges.

Therefore, the final answer is {100 oranges}.</s>","Mrs. Harrington gave a total of 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 boxes of oranges to her mom and sister.
She then had 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 boxes of oranges left.

1. We know that India has 4 more than half the number of states as the USA. Let's denote the number of states in the USA as 'x'.

2. According to the problem, half the number of states in the USA is x/2.

3. So, India has (x/2) + 4 states.

4. We want to find the total number of states in both countries, which is the sum of the states in each country: x (USA) + (x/2 + 4) (India).

5. Combining these terms, we get: x + x/2 + 4 = (3x/2) + 4.

6. However, we don't have the exact number of states in the USA, and it's not provided in the problem. Therefore, we can't find the exact total number of states in both countries.

The final answer cannot be determined without the number of states in the USA.</s>","Since the number of states in the USA is 50, half that number is 1/2*50 = 25

1. Richard, Jerry, and Robert share 60 cherries. Robert has 30 cherries, which means Richard and Jerry together have 60 - 30 = 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Since Robert has 30 cherries, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.
3. That means Jerry has 30 - Richard's cherries = 30 - 20 = 10 cherries.
4. Robert has 30 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries, so Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Therefore, {Robert has 20} more cherries than Jerry.</s>","Since Robert has 30, then 60 - 30 = <<30=30>>30 cherries are left to be shared by Richard and Jerry.
Richard has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 cherries since Robert has 10 more cherries than him.

1. Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 5 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Let's denote the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday as ""A"". So, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday would be A - 5.

2. On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. So, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday would be 10 + 5 = 15.

3. On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. So, A = 15.

4. Substituting A into the equation for Saturday's apple pie sales, we get 15 - 5 = 10 boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.

5. Now, let's calculate the total sales for Saturday. The cost of gingerbread is $6, so Sunny earned 10 * $6 = $60 from gingerbread sales. The cost of apple pie is $15, so Sunny earned 10 * $15 = $150 from apple pie sales. Therefore, Sunny earned a total of $60 + $150 = $210 on Saturday.

6. Let's move on to Sunday's sales. Sunny sold 15 boxes of gingerbread, so he earned 15 * $6 = $90 from gingerbread sales. He sold 15 boxes of apple pie, so he earned 15 * $15 = $225 from apple pie sales. Therefore, Sunny earned a total of $90 + $225 = $315 on Sunday.

7. Finally, let's calculate Sunny's total earnings for the two days. He earned $210 on Saturday and $315 on Sunday, so he earned a total of $210 + $315 = $525 for the two days.

The final answer is {Sunny earned $525 for two days}.</s>","He sold 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

   Cheaper amount = (Percentage of the blue car's cost) * (Price of the blue car)
   Cheaper amount = 0.4 * $100 = $40

3. Now, to find the price of the red car, we subtract the cheaper amount from the price of the blue car:
   Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - Cheaper amount
   Price of the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

4. To find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the price of the red car:
   Total cost = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
   Total cost = $100 + $60 = $160

So, the final answer is {The total cost of both cars is $160}.</s>","The red car is 40/100 * 100 = $<<40/100*100=40>>40 cheaper than the blue car.
That means, that the red car costs 100 - 40 = $<<100-40=60>>60.
So both cars cost 100 + 60 = $<<100+60=160>>160.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.

2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old at that time.

3. When Emil turns 24, he will also be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old at that time.

4. So, when Emil is 24, his dad is 48 and his brother is 12.

5. To find out the sum of their current ages, we need to calculate the difference in years between the time when Emil is 19 and the time when he is 24. This difference is 24 - 19 = 5 years.

6. Therefore, 5 years ago, Emil was 4 (19 - 5) years old, his dad was 43 (48 - 5) years old, and his brother was 7 (12 - 5) years old.

7. The sum of their current ages is then (4 + 5) + (43 + 5) + (7 + 5) = 9 + 48 + 12 = \boxed{69}

The age of his father now is 48 - 5= <<48-5=43>>43.
His brother is 12 - 5 = <<12-5=7>>7 years old right now.
The sum of his dad's and his brother's ages now is 43 + 7 = <<43+7=50>>50.

1. **Identify the number of beads given by each source**:
   - Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
   - Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her $20 + 10 = 30$ beads.
   - Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother, which means her friend gave her $2 \times 20 = 40$ beads.

2. **Calculate the total number of beads Adrianne has**:

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out the size of Charlie's boots. According to the problem, Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's boot. If Sophie wears size 5 boots, then Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25 times the size of a unit boot (we use this unit for simplicity).

2. Next, we need to find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. To do this, we add the sizes of their boots together and divide by 2 (since there are two people). The total size of their boots is 25 (Charlie's boots) + 5 (Sophie's boots) = 30 times the size of a unit boot.

3. To find the average, we divide the total size by 2. So, the average size of the boots is 30 / 2 = 15 times the size of a unit boot.

4. The average size of the boots is given as a multiple of a unit boot size. If we assume that a unit boot size is equivalent to a typical boot size (say, 7 inches for a child's boot), then the average size of the boots is 15 * 7 = 105 inches.

So, the final answer, in terms of a typical boot size, is {105 inches}, or, in terms of the unit used in the problem, {15 times the size of a unit boot}.</s>","If Sophie wears size five shoes, Charlie wears 5 * shoe size 5 = shoe size <<5*5=25>>25

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. First, we need to determine how many plants Pat will need to fill her flower bed. Since each plant grows 12 inches wide (which is 1 foot) and she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, we can calculate the distance covered by each plant and the space between them. The total length of the flower bed is 111 feet.

2. Since each plant and the space between them cover 1 foot and 1.5 feet respectively, the total distance covered by each plant (including the space between them) is 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet.

3. To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the distance covered by each plant. So, the number of plants is 111 / 2.5 = 44.4 plants. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 45 plants.

4. Now, we need to consider the 17 flowers Pat already owns. Since each of these flowers is also a plant, we subtract this from the total number of plants needed. So, the number of plants Pat needs to buy is 45 - 17 = 28 plants.

5. Finally, to find out how much money Pat will spend, we multiply the number of plants she needs to buy by the cost of each plant. So, the total cost is 28 * $6 = $168.

\boxed{The final answer is $168.}</s>","Pat's flower bed is 111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = <<111/1.5=74>>74 plants needed.

2. Next, let's find out how many sweet potato vines she needs. She wants to add 2 sweet potato vines to each of the 5 baskets. So, she needs 2 * 5 = 10 sweet potato vines.

3. Now, let's calculate the cost of the petunias. Each petunia costs $3.00. So, the cost of 15 petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

4. Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines. Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50. So, the cost of 10 sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

First, let's find out how much soil is used for sunflowers and carnations.

Soil used for sunflowers = Number of sunflowers * Soil per sunflower
                         = 4 * 3
                         = 12 pounds

Soil used for carnations = Number of carnations * Soil per carnation
                         = 10 * 1.5
                         = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = Soil used for sunflowers + Soil used for carnations

Step 2: Calculate how many shoes Jessica can buy each month.
Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. So, the number of shoes she can buy each month is:
$500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5 pairs

Peeling time per group = 1 minute

Now, let's calculate the time Emily spends on cooking one group of shrimp:

Cooking time per group = 10 minutes

Since Emily peels and cooks the shrimp simultaneously, we don't need to add the peeling and cooking times for each group together. Instead, we only need to find out the time it takes for her to cook all groups of shrimp, as she peels while cooking the previous group.

Total cooking time = Number of groups × Cooking time per group = 15 × 10 = 150 minutes

                [/INST] It seems like there are some missing values in your question (represented by ""?""). However, I can still give you a general approach to solve this problem if these values were given:

1. First, calculate the change in temperature during the time the air conditioner was on low. The temperature change is the rate of cooling (2 degrees/hour) multiplied by the time (0.3 hours), which gives 0.6 degrees.

2. Next, calculate the change in temperature during the time the air conditioner was on high. The temperature change is the rate of cooling (3 degrees/hour) multiplied by the time (4 hours), which gives 12 degrees.

3. Then, calculate the change in temperature during the time the air conditioner was off. The temperature change is the rate of warming (2 degrees/hour) multiplied by the time (2 hours), which gives 4 degrees.

4. The total change in temperature is the sum of the changes in steps 1, 2, and 3, minus the initial change (which is the change when the air conditioner was off). So, the total change is 0.6 - 2 (since it was initially cooling) + 12 - 4 - 4 (since it was cooling for 2 hours before turning off), which simplifies to 2.6 degrees.

5. Therefore, the final temperature is the starting temperature minus the total change in temperature, which we calculated to be 2.6 degrees.

Hence, the final answer would be {The final temperature is 2.6 degrees lower than the starting temperature}.</s>","The air conditioner ran for 3 hours on low, so the temperature dropped 2 * 3 = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees.
It then ran for 4 hours on high, so the temperature dropped another 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 degrees.
It was then turned off for 2 hours, so the temperature rose 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 degrees.
Thus, the final temperature was 6 + 12 - 4 = <<6+12-4=14>>14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the Comet for the first time when he was three times the age his dad was when he saw the Comet.
4. We need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time.

Let's denote:
- B as Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time.
- D as Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time.
- X as the number of years after 1930 when the Comet was last seen.

From the information given:
- D = 3B (Bill was three times as old as his dad was when the Comet was last seen)

Since Bill saw the Comet for the first time when he was B, and the Comet has a period of 75 years, we can assume that he also saw the Comet 75 - X years after 1930 when it was last seen.

So, B = D - (75 - X)

Substitute D with 3B (from the information given):

3B = B + (75 - X)

Solve for B:

2B = 75 - X

Since X is the number of years after 1930 when the Comet was last seen, and Bill saw the Comet when he was B, we can assume that X = 0 (since we don't have any information about how many years after 1930 the first sighting of the Comet was).

So, 2B = 75

B = 75 / 2

B = \boxed{37.5}

So, Bill was 37.5 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.</s>","Bill saw the Comet for the second time when he was 30 years * 3= <<30*3=90>>90 years old.
Comet Halley can be seen every 75 years, so Bill saw the comet for the first time when he was 90 years - 75 years = <<90-75=15>>15 years old.

2. Buford also writes checks every month for his gas bill. There are 12 months in a year. So, he writes 12 checks per year for the gas bill.

3. Buford writes checks twice a month to the church. That means he writes 2 checks per month. There are 12 months in a year. So, he writes 2*12 = 24 checks per year for the church.

4. Buford writes checks quarterly (every three months) to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year. So, he writes 4 checks per year for the pest and lawn service.

Adding all these checks together, Buford writes a total of 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = \boxed{52} checks per year.</s>","Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill, or 1*12=<<1*12=12>>12 checks each year.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as F.

2. According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4)F.

3. The remaining flights, which make up one-quarter of the total, are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is (1/4)F/2 = F/8.

4. The second plane makes 44 flights to Poland, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. So, F = 2*44 = 88.

5. Now we can find the number of flights to France by substituting F = 88 into the formula derived in step 3.

The final answer is {The first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.}</s>","The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = <<44*2=88>>88 flights a day.
If 3/4 of the first plane’s flights are to Greece, then flights to France or Germany make up 1 – 3/4 = 1/4 of the total daily flights.
Therefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 flights to France or Germany.
Splitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 flights to France in one day.

                [/INST] It seems like you've started a story and a mathematical problem in the same sentence! Let's break down the mathematical part.

1. First, we need to determine the length of each wolf's howl. According to the problem, Tobias's howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. So, Chikote's howl lasts for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.

3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined. So, Igneous's howl lasts for 20 (Tobias's howl) + 40 (Chikote's howl) = 60 seconds.

4. Now, we need to find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls. So, the combined length is 20 (Tobias's howl) + 40 (Chikote's howl) + 60 (Igneous's howl) = 120 seconds.

5. Since the problem asks for the answer in minutes, we convert the seconds to minutes. We know that 1 minute = 60 seconds. So, 120 seconds = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.</s>","Chikote howls for 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seconds.
Igneous howls for 20+40=<<20+40=60>>60 seconds.
In total, the combined length of time, in seconds, of the three wolves' howls is 20+40+60=<<20+40+60=120>>120 seconds.
Thus, the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 minutes.

4. So far, Adam has received a total of $6 (from his mother) + $12 (from his father) = $18 from his parents.
5. The total amount Adam needed to pay for the trousers is $30.

1. We know that the total age of the four children is 20 years.

2. Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. So, their combined age is 3 + 4 = 7 years.

3. Therefore, the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 20 - 7 = 13 years.

4. We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's represent the average age as 'x'. So, Helene's age is 2x.

5. Since there are four children, the total age of the group is 4x. But we know that the total age is 20, so we have 4x = 20, which means x = 5.

6. So, the average age of the group is 5 years. And since Helene is twice as old as the average, Helene is 2 * 5 = 10 years old.

7. Now, we know the total age of Helene and Wilfred is 13 years. Since Helene is 10 years old, Wilfred's age is 13 - 10 = 3 years.

4. The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is half of the total number of cookies: 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies.

5. If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, then we can find out how many people are in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got: 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. We know that there are 2 adults and 4 kids.
2. Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. This means that the two adults together get 5 times as big a slice as all 4 kids combined.
3. If we imagine the watermelon as a whole, it can be divided into 5 equal parts (2 parts for the adults and 3 parts for the kids).
4. Since the kids get 3 parts, their combined share is 3/5 of the watermelon.
5. Each kid therefore gets a share of 3/5 (their combined share) divided by 4 (the number of kids), which equals 3/20 of the watermelon.
6. Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, so they get 2 * 3/20 = 6/20 or 3/10 of the watermelon.
7. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100, so each adult gets a percentage of the watermelon equal to 3/10 * 100 = 30%.

Therefore, each adult gets {30%} of the watermelon.</s>","Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.
Since each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon
So the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage
The percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)
x = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

1. First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on rounds. He has 9 inpatients and each round takes 20 minutes. So, the time spent on rounds is 9 * 20 = 180 minutes.

2. Next, let's calculate the total time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So, the time spent on appointments is 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

3. Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent at the clinic. This is 180 + 300 = 480 minutes.

4. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total hours Doctor Jones spends at the clinic is 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

5. Finally, Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic, so the time left for him to update his records is 9 - 8 = 1 hour.

So, Doctor Jones will have {1 hour left to update his records}.</s>","Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients, so his rounds will take 9 * 20 = <<9*20=180>>180 minutes.

The rounds and appointments will take 180 + 300 = <<180+300=480>>480 minutes total.
An hour is 60 minutes, so rounds and appointments will take 480 / 60 = <<480/60=8>>8 hours.

                    question:
                    , Jordan wanted to : surprise her mom : with a ! homemade birthday ! cake.  From reading the : instructions, she . knew it ! would take 20 minutes . to make the cake batter and ; 30 minutes ? to bake ! the cake.  ; The cake would ! require ? 2 hours to cool and ; an : additional 10 minutes to frost the cake.  , If she plans to make the cake all on : the same day, : what is : the : latest time of day that , Jordan : can , start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 ; pm?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. The total time taken to make the cake is the sum of the time taken to make the cake batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake.

2. The time taken to make the cake batter is 20 minutes.

3. The time taken to bake the cake is 30 minutes.

4. The time taken to cool the cake is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

5. The time taken to frost the cake is 10 minutes.

6. So, the total time taken to make the cake is 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

7. If Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, she needs to account for the time taken to make the cake in the reverse order (since she can start working on it in reverse).

8. So, she needs to start at 5:00 pm - 180 minutes.

9. To convert 180 minutes into hours, divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). So, 180 minutes = 3 hours.

10. Therefore, Jordan needs to start making the cake at 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

\boxed{2:00 pm} is the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.</s>","1 hour is 60 minutes so we know that 2 hours to cool the cake is the same as 2*60 so <<2*60=120>>120 min
It will take Jordan 20 min to make the batter, 30 to bake, 120 to cool and 10 to frost so the cake will take 20 +30 +120 +10 = <<20+30+120+10=180>>180 minutes total
Jordan needs to convert 180 minutes to hours so 180/60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours
If the cake needs to be finished by 5:00 pm and it will take 3 hours total to make then 5-3 = <<5-3=2>>2:00 pm is the latest she can start making the cake

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Lisa and Peter sold 64 chocolate bars together.

2. Lisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars, so we can represent the number of chocolate bars she sold as 3.5 * x, where x is the number of chocolate bars in a box.

3. Peter sold four and a half boxes of chocolate bars, so we can represent the number of chocolate bars he sold as 4.5 * x.

4. The total number of chocolate bars sold is 64, so we can set up the following equation: 3.5 * x + 4.5 * x = 64

5. Combining the terms on the left side of the equation gives us 8 * x = 64.

6. To find the number of chocolate bars in a box (x), we can divide both sides of the equation by 8: 64 / 8 = x

\boxed{8} is the final answer. There are 8 chocolate bars in a box.</s>","Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.
Lisa sold 3 1/2 * B bars.
Peter sold 4 1/2 * B bars.
Together, they sold 3 1/2 * B + 4 1/2 * B = 8B = 64 bars.
Therefore, there are B = 64 / 8 = <<64/8=8>>8 chocolate bars in a box.

How ? much are the expected earnings of . the ; dance studio ! in . a month?
                [/INST] To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily earnings by considering the cost to rent the studio and the cost per student per session.
2. Calculate the weekly earnings by multiplying the daily earnings by the number of days the studio is rented per week.
3. Calculate the monthly earnings by multiplying the weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a month.

Let's go through each step:

1. Daily earnings = Cost to rent the studio + (Cost per student per session * Number of students)
   Daily earnings = $25 + ($1.50 * 10)
   Daily earnings = $25 + $15
   Daily earnings = $40

2. Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days rented per week
   Weekly earnings = $40 * 3
   Weekly earnings = $120

3. Monthly earnings = Weekly earnings * Number of weeks in a month
   Monthly earnings = $120 * 4 (assuming an average month has 4 weeks)
   Monthly earnings = $480

Therefore, the final answer is {The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480}.</s>","The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.
So the total earnings per session is $15 + $25 = $<<15+25=40>>40.
Thus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.
Therefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.

                [/INST] Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box that Peter has as P and the number of chocolate bars in each box that Martha has as M.

Step 1: Find the total number of chocolate bars each has.
Peter has 4 boxes with P chocolate bars each, so he has a total of 4P chocolate bars.
Martha has 7 boxes with M chocolate bars each, so she has a total of 7M chocolate bars.

According to the problem, Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars. So we have:

4P = 64
7M = 56

Step 2: Solve for P and M.
From 4P = 64, we get P = 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.
From 7M = 56, we get M = 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box and Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Step 3: Find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha.
Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box and Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box. So, Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The reasoning for this solution is as follows:

1. The total population of porcupines is 50.
2. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, so that's 3/5 * 50 = \boxed{30} female porcupines.
3. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, so that's 4 * 30 = \boxed{120} baby porcupines every month.
4. In a year, there are 12 months, so that's 120 baby porcupines/month * 12 months = \boxed{1440} baby porcupines in a year.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to find the volume of the pool and then determine the cost of filling it with water.

1. First, we calculate the volume of the pool. The volume of a rectangular prism (like a swimming pool) is found by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

Volume = Length * Width * Depth
   Volume = 14 feet * 25 feet * 4 feet
   Volume = 1400 cubic feet

2. Next, we need to determine how many gallons of water are needed to fill the pool. The pool company instructed the Smith family to multiply the volume in cubic feet by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.

Gallons needed = Volume in cubic feet * 5.9
   Gallons needed = 1400 cubic feet * 5.9
   Gallons needed = 8260 gallons

3. The final step is to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Gallons needed * Cost per gallon
   Cost = 8260 gallons * $0.10
   Cost = $826

So, it will cost \boxed{$826}$ to fill the pool.</s>","Mr. Smith found the volume of the pool to be 14 feet wide x 25 feet long x 4 feet deep = <<14*25*4=1400>>1,400 cubic feet

Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we find the number of yellow sticks:
Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Finally, we add up all the sticks to find the total number:

1. Half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000/2 = 1500.

2. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. So, the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500/4 = 375.

3. Since half of the students over 16 are male, the other half are female. So, the number of female students over 16 years old is also 375.

4. The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 years old is also 3000/2 = 1500.

2. On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is (1/4) * 18,000 = 4,500 gallons.

3. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda, which is (3/4) * 4,500 = 3,375 gallons.

4. So, in total, on the first day, they pumped 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 gallons.

5. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is (2/3) * 4,500 = 3,000 gallons.

6. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is (1/3) * 3,375 = 1,125 gallons.

7. So, in total, on the second day, they pumped 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons.

8. Therefore, the total amount of water they pumped in two days is 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 gallons.

                    question:
                    Maria was charging her power bank before going ; to ? the park when she disconnected it ? and ! noticed the power ? bank ; wasn’t : fully ; charged ; yet. Once at the park, her friends asked her ; if ? they could charge their , phones. ; While . charging her , friends’ ; phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the ; total capacity each hour. : 5 hours later ! the ! battery started : to lose instead , 7% of the . total capacity each hour for about : 3 hours. In ? the end, the charge remaining was ? 28%. What : was the , charge ; of ! the power bank when Maria went out to the park?
                [/INST] To find the initial charge of the power bank, we need to work backwards based on the information given. 

1. After 5 hours of charging friends' phones, the power bank was losing 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours. This means the charge decreased by 7% three times, which equals a total 21% decrease (since each hour is equivalent to a 7% decrease). So, if the charge was 28% at the end, after a 21% decrease, it was 59% before (1.00 * 0.79 = 0.59 or 59% when rounded).

2. Before the last 5 hours of battery loss, the power bank was losing 9% of its capacity each hour. From the 59% charge we just found, it was losing 9% per hour for 3 hours. To find out what the charge was before these 3 hours, we need to reverse this decrease.

3. Starting from a 59% charge, a 9% decrease each hour for 3 hours would decrease the charge to 28% of the original capacity (since 0.59^3 = 0.28 or 28% when rounded). To find out what the charge was before this 3-hour decrease, we can create an equation where ""x"" is the initial charge percentage for the power bank.

x * 0.9^3 = 59%

Solving for x gives us the initial charge percentage for the power bank. x = 59 / 0.9^3 = 81.8 or 82% when rounded.

{The final answer is the initial charge of the power bank was 82%}</s>","At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.
Later on, the power bank lost 7% per hour * 3 hours = 21%.
The power bank charge remaining was 28%, so the power bank charge before going to the park was 45 + 21 +28 = 94%.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to determine Janet's total earnings per week. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings from wages are:
Wage earnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked
= $10 * 40 hours
= $400

And her weekly earnings from tips are:
Tip earnings = Hourly tip * Hours worked
= $15 * 40 hours
= $600

So, her total weekly earnings are:
Total weekly earnings = Wage earnings + Tip earnings
= $400 + $600
= $1000

2. Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to make a 20% down payment on a $10,000 car. A 20% down payment on a $10,000 car is:
Down payment = Percentage * Total cost
= 20% * $10,000
= 0.20 * $10,000
= $2,000

3. Finally, to determine how many weeks she needs to work to save the down payment, we need to divide the down payment by her total weekly earnings:
Number of weeks = Down payment / Total weekly earnings
= $2,000 / $1000
= 2 weeks

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the $10,000 car.

Final answer: She needs to work 2 weeks.</s>","She makes 10+15=$<<10+15=25>>25 an hour from working
That means each week she makes 25*40=$<<25*40=1000>>1000

So she needs to work 2000/1000=<<2000/1000=2>>2 weeks

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the total amount spent on peaches, pears, apples, and kiwis by Jamaar.

- Peaches cost $0.5 each, and he bought 3. So, he spent 3 * $0.5 = $1.5 on peaches.
   - Pears cost $0.5 each, and he bought 4. So, he spent 4 * $0.5 = $2 on pears.
   - Apples cost $0.75 each, and he bought 5. So, he spent 5 * $0.75 = $3.75 on apples.
   - Kiwis cost $1 each, and he bought 2. So, he spent 2 * $1 = $2 on kiwis.

2. Now, let's add up all the amounts spent: $1.5 + $2 + $3.75 + $2 = $9.25.

3. Since Jamaar had $10 and he has already spent $9.25, he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

4. Now, let's calculate how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75. Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is $0.75 / $0.25 = 3.

So, the final answer is that Jamaar can buy \boxed{3} plums.</s>","He has spent $3.5 on peaches and pears because 7 x .5 = <<7*.5=3.5>>3.5
He has spent $2 on kiwis because 2 x 1 = <<2*1=2>>2
He has spent $3.75 on apples because 5 x .75 = <<5*.75=3.75>>3.75
He has already spent $9.25 because 3.5 + 2 + 3.75 = <<3.5+2+3.75=9.25>>9.25
He can buy three plums because .75 / .25 = <<.75/.25=3>>3

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne purchased. She bought 'a' boxes, and each box contains 15 packs. So, the total number of packs is:

Total packs = a * 15

Next, each pack contains 60 pieces, so the total number of sweets is:

Total sweets = Total packs * 60 = a * 15 * 60

Anne kept two packs, which means she gave the rest to her 10 friends equally. The number of packs distributed is:

Packs distributed = Total packs - 2 = a * 15 - 2

Each friend receives an equal share of these packs, so the number of packs each friend gets is:

Packs per friend = Packs distributed / 10 = (a * 15 - 2) / 10

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces each friend receives is:

Pieces per friend = Packs per friend * 60 = [(a * 15 - 2) / 10] * 60

The final answer is {Pieces per friend}

\boxed{[(a * 15 - 2) * 60] / 10}</s>","After Anne kept 2 packs, there were only 15 - 2 = <<15-2=13>>13 packs left.
Therefore, there were 13 x 60 = <<13*60=780>>780 pieces of sweets left.
So, each of her 10 friends received 780 / 10 = <<780/10=78>>78 pieces of sweets.

(Round ; to the , nearest integer)
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. We start with the initial price of carrots, which is $120.

2. The price increases by 5% each year. So, after one year, the price would be the initial price plus 5% of the initial price. In mathematical terms, this is $120 + (5/100 * $120).

3. This simplifies to $120 + $6 = $126.

4. After two years, the price would again increase by 5%. So, we take the price after one year ($126) and add 5% of that amount. This is $126 + (5/100 * $126).

5. This simplifies to $126 + $6.3 = $132.3.

6. After three years, the price would again increase by 5%. So, we take the price after two years ($132.3) and add 5% of that amount. This is $132.3 + (5/100 * $132.3).

7. This simplifies to $132.3 + $6.615 = $138.915.

8. Since the question asks us to round to the nearest integer, the final price after three years would be $139.

So, the final answer is {The final answer is $139}.</s>","In the first year, the price of carrots increases by 5/100*120 = $<<5/100*120=6>>6
After 3 years, the price of carrots will increase by $6*3 = $<<6*3=18>>18

Step 2: Out of these 8 albums, 3 were selfies and 2 were portraits.
Step 3: This means the remaining albums are the regular ones. So, the number of regular albums is 8 (total albums) - 3 (selfie albums) - 2 (portrait albums) = 3 albums.
Step 4: However, the question asks for the total number of portraits and selfies. We know that 3 albums were selfies and 2 albums were portraits.
Step 5: Since the picture count for each album is the same, let's say it's x.
Step 6: So, the total number of selfies is 3x (since 3 albums were selfies) and the total number of portraits is 2x (since 2 albums were portraits).
Step 7: To get the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the two values together. So, the final answer is 3x + 2x = 5x.

Final Answer: \boxed{5x} (Since we don't know the exact number of pictures per album, we can't give a numerical answer)</s>","Olivia had 72 pictures / 8 albums = <<72/8=9>>9 picture per album.

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out his reading speed in pages per minute, we divide the number of pages by the number of minutes:

Speed = Pages / Minutes
Speed = 3 pages / 10 minutes
Speed = 0.3 pages/minute

Step 2: Calculate the time James spends reading 18 pages
Now that we know James's reading speed, we can find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages by dividing the number of pages by his reading speed:

Time = Pages / Speed
Time = 18 pages / 0.3 pages/minute

2. We know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, so L = 3S.

3. We also know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so S = $4.

4. This means that L = 3 * $4 = $12.

5. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as X. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2X.

6. The total earnings from the sales is $120. This can be represented as 2X * S + X * L = $120.

7. Substituting S = $4 and L = $12 into the equation gives us 2X * $4 + X * $12 = $120.

8. Simplifying this equation gives us 8X + 12X = 120, or 20X = 120.

9. Dividing both sides of the equation by 20 gives us X = 6.

10. Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large ones, 2X = 2 * 6 = 12.

So, the final answer is that Teresa sold \boxed{12} small stuffed animals.</s>","Let A be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.
Thus, she sold 2A small stuffed animals.
Large stuffed animals cost 3 * 4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.
She earned 12A + 4 * 2A = 12A + 8A = 20A = $120 from selling stuffed animals today.
Thus, she sold A = 120 / 20 = <<120/20=6>>6 large stuffed animals today.
Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, so she sold 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 small stuffed animals today.

                [/INST] Sure, I can help with that. Let's break it down:

1. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
2. His wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
3. Their son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

For the man: 5 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 35 sandwiches/week
For the wife: 4 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 28 sandwiches/week
For the son: 2 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 14 sandwiches/week

Now, we add up their weekly consumption: 35 sandwiches/week + 28 sandwiches/week + 14 sandwiches/week = 77 sandwiches/week

So, the family eats a total of 77 sandwiches per week.

{The final answer is 77 sandwiches for the week.}</s>","The number of sandwiches they eat in one day is 5 + 4 + 2 = <<5+4+2=11>>11 sandwiches.

                [/INST] First, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling the cookies and cupcakes.

The number of cookies Suzanne sold is 80 and she sold each for $1. So, the total earnings from cookies = Number of cookies * Price per cookie
= 80 * $1
= $80

Similarly, the number of cupcakes she sold is 60 and she sold each for $4. So, the total earnings from cupcakes = Number of cupcakes * Price per cupcake
= 60 * $4
= $240

Now, we add the earnings from cookies and cupcakes to get the total earnings.
= Total earnings from cookies + Total earnings from cupcakes
= $80 + $240
= $320

Next, we need to calculate the amount she gave to her two sisters.
She gave each of her two sisters $10. So, the total amount given to her sisters = Amount given to one sister * Number of sisters
= $10 * 2
= $20

Finally, we subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings to get the amount she has left.
= Total earnings - Amount given to sisters
= $320 - $20
= $300

{The final answer is $300}</s>","Suzzane's revenue from the cookies is 80 x $1 = $<<80*1=80>>80.
Her revenue from the cupcakes is 60 x $4 = $<<60*4=240>>240.
Her total revenue for the cupcakes and cookies is $240 + $80 = $<<240+80=320>>320.
She gave a total of 10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20 to her sisters for helping her,
So, Suzzane has $32 - $20 = $300 left.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the Smith twins found 30 eggs each. So, the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins is 30 * 2 = 60 eggs.
2. Then, we know that 10 eggs were not found by anyone (except the Smith twins). So, the total number of eggs found by everyone else including the Smith twins is 100 - 10 = 90 eggs.
3. However, we already accounted for the 60 eggs found by the Smith twins. So, the number of eggs found by the friends of the Smith twins is 90 - 60 = 30 eggs.

So, the friends found 30 eggs.

Final answer: {30 eggs}</s>","The Smith twins found, 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 eggs.
The number that remained hidden was 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40 eggs

                [/INST] First, let's determine the amount of ore a dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe compared to his bare hands, he can mine 12 pounds * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's determine the amount of ore a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe compared to an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 pounds * 1.5 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a day. They can mine 36 pounds/dwarf/day * 40 dwarves = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days. They can mine 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = 43200 pounds of ore per month.

                [/INST] To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we first need to understand that the prices are proportional. This means that the price of the sandwich in each package is the same. Let's denote this price as P.

Step 1: Find the price of one sandwich in the first package.
The price of one sandwich in the first package can be found by dividing the price of the package by the number of sandwiches in the package. So, P = $3 / 2 = $1.50 per sandwich.

Step 2: Verify the price of one sandwich in the second package.
The price of one sandwich in the second package can be found by dividing the price of the package by the number of sandwiches in the package. So, P = $6 / 4 = $1.50 per sandwich.

Step 3: Find the price of the third package.
Since the price of one sandwich is $1.50, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches can be found by multiplying the price of one sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the package. So, the price of the third package = $1.50 * 8 = $12.

1. Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000.
2. He sells his old bedroom for $1000.
3. He uses that $1000 to pay part of the cost of the new bedroom set.
4. So, the amount he still owes for the new bedroom set is the remaining cost, which is $3000 (total cost) - $1000 (amount he used from his old bedroom set sales), which equals $2000.
5. He has to pay 10% of this remaining cost per month.

So, to calculate the monthly payment, we multiply the remaining cost by 10%.

Monthly payment = Remaining cost * 10%
                       = $2000 * 0.10

                [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step using detailed calculations:

1. **Calculate the number of red balloons that burst:**
   - Sally initially had 25 red balloons.
   - A gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst.

   Calculation: $25 \times 0.4 = 10$

   So, $10$ red balloons burst.

2. **Determine the number of green balloons that survived the burst:**
   - Sally had 7 green balloons initially.
   - Since only the red balloons burst due to the gust of wind, all 7 green balloons remained.

   Therefore, she had $7$ green balloons.

3. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons released:**
   - Sally had 12 yellow balloons initially.
   - She accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.

   Calculation: $12 \div 2 = 6$

   So, $6$ yellow balloons were released.

4. **Find the remaining number of yellow balloons:**
   - Sally initially had 12 yellow balloons.
   - After releasing half, she had $12 - 6 = 6$ yellow balloons left.

   Therefore, she had $6$ yellow balloons left.

5. **Calculate the number of blue balloons she caught in a tree:**
   - Sally caught 8 blue balloons in a tree.

   So, she caught $8$ blue balloons.

6. **Determine the number of blue balloons she added to her remaining clutch:**
   - She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons to her remaining clutch.

   Calculation: $8 \times 0.75 = 6$

   Therefore, she added $6$ blue balloons to her clutch.

7. **Calculate the total number of balloons Sally added to her clutch:**
   - She added the 6 yellow balloons and the 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

   Calculation: $6 + 6 = 12$

   So, she added $12$ balloons to her clutch.

8. **Calculate the total number of balloons Sally had in her clutch:**
   - Initially, she had 7 green and 7 yellow balloons.
   - After adding the 6 blue balloons and the 6 yellow balloons, she had a total of $7 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 26$ balloons in her clutch.

Therefore, Sally finally carried $\boxed{26}$ balloons into the school.</s>","Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons

1. Let's denote the events as follows:
   - A: Tomorrow, Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
   - B: Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.
   - C: Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.

2. The probability of A is 50%, so P(A) = 0.5.

3. If event A does not happen, then event B can happen. The probability of B given A not happening (or A's complement, B|A') is 40%, so P(B|A') = 0.4. Since P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.5, we can calculate P(B|A') = 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2.

4. If both events A and B do not happen, then event C can happen. The probability of C given both A and B not happening (or A' and B' happening, C|A' and B') is 20%, so P(C|A' and B') = 0.2. Since P(A' and B') = P(A') * P(B|A') = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2, we can calculate P(C|A' and B') = 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04.

5. The total probability of none of the events happening (i.e., Marcus having to turn in his homework) is 1 minus the sum of the probabilities of the events happening: P(none) = 1 - P(A) - P(B|A') - P(C|A' and B') = 1 - 0.5 - 0.2 - 0.04 = 0.26.

So, the final answer is that there is a 26% chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow.</s>","First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%
Then find the chance the teacher doesn't grant the whole class an extension by subtracting the chance she does from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%
Then find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%
Now find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3

There are 950 graduates.

Step 3: Determine how many tickets each graduate can distribute.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.
3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, 3 small beans = 1 medium-sized bean.

To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat:

1. From step 3, we know that 3 small beans = 1 medium-sized bean.

                    . Melissa is ! summoned to jury duty. She spends ? 6 hours ; a day for 3 days listening to ! a court , case. If Melissa is paid ? $15 per day but also ? has , to pay $3 ! for parking ? each day, how much jury pay : does : she make per hour after ? expenses?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. First, we need to calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:
   Total hours = Hours per day * Number of days
   Total hours = 6 hours * 3 days
   Total hours = 18 hours

2. Next, we calculate Melissa's total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day, and there are 3 days, so:
   Total earnings = Pay per day * Number of days
   Total earnings = $15 * 3 days
   Total earnings = $45

3. Now, we calculate the total expenses Melissa has for parking. She pays $3 per day, and there are 3 days, so:
   Total expenses = Expense per day * Number of days
   Total expenses = $3 * 3 days
   Total expenses = $9

4. Finally, to find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we subtract the total expenses from the total earnings and then divide the result by the total hours she worked:
   Hourly pay after expenses = (Total earnings - Total expenses) / Total hours
   Hourly pay after expenses = ($45 - $9) / 18 hours
   Hourly pay after expenses = $36 / 18 hours
   Hourly pay after expenses = $2 per hour

So, after calculating her experiences, Melissa makes \boxed{$2} per hour on jury duty.</s>","First find Melissa's net daily pay by subtracting the parking expense from her $15 gross pay: $15/day - $3/day = $<<15-3=12>>12/day
Then divide this number by the number of hours Melissa spends in court each day to find her hourly pay: $12/day / 6 hours/day = $<<12/6=2>>2/hour

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's find out how much Ted spent on books. He bought 3 books, each costing $16. So, the total cost for books is 3 * $16 = $48.
2. Next, let's look at the pencils. He bought 3 pencils, each costing $6. So, the total cost for pencils is 3 * $6 = $18.
3. Now, to find out how much Ted spent in total, we add the cost of the books and the pencils. So, $48 (books) + $18 (pencils) = $66.

Therefore, Ted spent a total of $66.

He plans to place a bottle every 3 feet on his 24 feet wide driveway, resulting in 24 / 3 = 8 bottles. After starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in, and triggering the next bottle.

Since the first bottle doesn't require the 5-second delay for Richard to travel to it, we start the count from 0 seconds for the first bottle.

1. For the 1st bottle, no time is needed to travel (0 seconds).
2. For the 2nd through 8th bottles, Richard takes 5 seconds to reach each one, so he takes 5(8 - 1) = 5(7) = 35 seconds in total for all the travels.

After starting and the final bottle is placed, Richard needs to trigger the first bottle, which would take another 5 seconds.

Thus, the total time taken for Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds (for all travels) + 5 seconds (to trigger the first bottle) = {35 + 5 = 40 seconds}.

The final answer is Richard will take 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.</s>","If Richard's driveway is 24 feet long and he puts a bottle of soda every 3 feet, then out of 24 feet total there are 24 / 3 feet between each bottle = <<24/3=8>>8 bottles.

1. First, we need to find out the total number of apples Uncle Franky has. Since he has ordered two boxes and each box contains forty apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples per box.
   Total apples = Number of boxes * Apples per box
   Total apples = 2 * 40
   Total apples = 80

2. Next, we need to determine how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, given that he wants to pack eight apples in one pack. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack.
   Number of packs = Total apples / Apples per pack
   Number of packs = 80 / 8

2. Next, calculate the cost of Mozzarella cheese. The cost per pound is $6 and Amor buys 3 pounds. So, the cost is $6/pound * 3 pounds = $18.
3. Now, add the total cost of the cheese. The total cost is $22 (Parmesan) + $18 (Mozzarella) = $40.
4. Finally, subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money Amor had, which was $50. So, $50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, after buying the cheese, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

1. First, we need to find the dimensions of each piece of fabric Jim needs to buy. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

2. So, the length of each piece of fabric will be 6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet.

3. And the width of each piece of fabric will be 8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet.

4. Now, to find the area of one piece of fabric, we multiply its length by its width. So, the area will be 8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet.

3. On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. To find out how many letters they delivered on Wednesday, we first find twice the number of Tuesday's letters: 102 * 2 = 204. Then, we add the 5 extra letters: 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the letters from each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736 letters.

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer. So, Cole's new height is:

50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, to find the difference between their heights, we subtract Xavier's new height from Cole's new height:

                [/INST] Let's denote the amount of money the first person took as x.

According to the problem, the second person took x + $80, and the third person took twice what the second person took, which is 2(x + $80).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920

Solving this equation step by step:

x + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920

Combining like terms:

4x + $240 = $1920

Subtracting $240 from both sides:

4x = $1680

Dividing both sides by 4:

x = $420

So, the first person took $420.

X + X + 80 + 2*X + 80*2 = 1920
X*4 + 240 = 1920.
X*4 = 1680.
X = <<420=420>>420.

                    A team of . 4 painters worked ? on a mansion for 3/8ths ? of a day every day : for : 3 weeks. How many hours of work : did : each . painter put in?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into several steps:

1. We know that there are 4 painters and they worked for 3 weeks. So, the total number of person-days of work done by the painters is:
   Total person-days = Number of painters * Number of days
   If we assume that a day consists of 8 hours, then one person-day is equivalent to 8 hours of work.

2. However, we also know that the painters worked only 3/8ths of a day each day. Therefore, the effective number of hours worked in a day by one painter is:
   Hours per person-day = 3/8 * 8 = 3 hours

3. Now, we can calculate the total number of hours worked by one painter over 3 weeks (which is 21 days):
   Total hours per painter = 3 weeks * 3 days/week * 3 hours/day = 27 hours

4. Since there are 4 painters, the total hours worked by all painters combined would be:
   Total hours for all painters = 4 painters * 27 hours/painter = 108 hours

5. To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we divide the total hours worked by all painters by the number of painters:
   Hours per painter = Total hours for all painters / Number of painters
   Hours per painter = 108 hours / 4 painters = 27 hours

So, each painter put in {27} hours of work.</s>","There are 24 hours in a day so 3/8ths of a day is (3/8)*24 = <<3/8*24=9>>9 hours
One week has 7 days so 3 weeks have 7*3 = <<7*3=21>>21 days
Each painter put in 9*21 = <<9*21=189>>189 hours of work

                [/INST] Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as x.

From the problem, we know that:

1. In the first set, he retrieved (x + 4) balls.
2. In the third set, he retrieved (x / 2) balls.
3. The total number of balls retrieved is 19.

So we can write an equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x / 2) = 19

Simplifying this, we get:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:

2.5x = 15

Dividing both sides by 2.5, we get:

x = 6

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.

Since he retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second, he retrieved 6 + 4 = \boxed{10} balls in the first set.

The final answer is 10.</s>","Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.
In the second set, he retrieved 2B balls.
In the first set, he retrieved 2B + 4 balls.
In total, he retrieved B + 2B + 2B + 4 = 5B + 4 = 19 balls.
Thus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.
Therefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.
Hence, in the second set, he retrieved 2B = 3 * 2 = 6 balls.
In the first set he retrieved 2(3) + 4 balls = 10

                [/INST] To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010. Since the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year, we can use the formula for depreciation:

Depreciation = Original Price * Depreciation Rate * Number of Years

First, let's calculate the price of the car in 2008:
Depreciation in 2007 = $20000 * 0.21
Depreciation in 2007 = $4200

Price in 2008 = Original Price - Depreciation in 2007
Price in 2008 = $20000 - $4200
Price in 2008 = $15800

Now, calculate the price of the car in 2009:
Depreciation in 2008 = Price in 2008 * Depreciation Rate
Depreciation in 2008 = $15800 * 0.21
Depreciation in 2008 = $3298

Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - Depreciation in 2008
Price in 2009 = $15800 - $3298
Price in 2009 = $12502

Finally, calculate the price of the car in 2010:
Depreciation in 2009 = Price in 2009 * Depreciation Rate
Depreciation in 2009 = $12502 * 0.21
Depreciation in 2009 = $2625.22

Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - Depreciation in 2009
Price in 2010 = $12502 - $2625.22
Price in 2010 = $9876.78

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9877. {The final answer is $9877}</s>","The price of the car depreciates of 20000 * 21% = $<<20000*21*.01=4200>>4200 per year.
Ben had the car for 2010 - 2007 = <<2010-2007=3>>3 years.
The price of the car depreciates 4200 * 3 = $<<4200*3=12600>>12600 from 2007 to 2010.
So the price of the car in the year 2010 is $20000 - $12600 = $<<20000-12600=7400>>7400.

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books.

Step 2: Calculate the number of books written in German.
10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 50 * 0.1 = 5 books.

Step 3: Calculate the number of books written in Spanish.
All remaining books are written in Spanish, so the number of Spanish books is the total number of books minus the number of books written in English and German. So, 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 books.

\[ \text{Total cups} = \text{Cups per day} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total cups} = 8 \times 30 \]
\[ \text{Total cups} = 240 \]

1. **Two years ago**: Leo had 100 stickers in his collection.

2. **Last year**: He collected 50 more stickers. So, the total number of stickers he had last year is the initial 100 plus the 50 he collected, which equals 150 stickers.

3. **This year**: He collected twice the number of stickers as last year. So, this year he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

4. **Total collection**: Adding the stickers from the past two years, we get the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection: 150 (from last year) + 100 (from this year) = 250 stickers.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to determine how much cat food Imma uses in a day. Since she feeds her cats twice a day and each time she uses 60 grams of cat food, the daily amount of cat food used is:
   Daily cat food = Feeding time per day * Amount of cat food per feeding
   = 2 * 60 grams
   = 120 grams

2. Next, we need to figure out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily usage:
   Number of days = Total cat food / Daily cat food
   = 720 grams / 120 grams
   = 6 days

So, {The final answer is} that 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days.</s>","The 3 cats consume 60 grams/cat x 3 cats = <<60*3=180>>180 grams of food per meal.
Since they eat twice a day, then they consume 180 grams/meal x 2 meals/day = <<180*2=360>>360 grams in a day.
So, 720 grams of cat food only last for 720 grams / 360 grams/day = <<720/360=2>>2 days.

1. There are 4 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is:
\[4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ slices}\]

2. Becky ate 10 slices, which is 3 more slices than Jake did. So, Jake ate:
\[10 - 3 = 7 \text{ slices}\]

3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did. So, Silvia ate:
\[2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ slices}\]

4. To find out how many total slices they ate, we add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

                [/INST] Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part of the meal as D (in minutes). According to the problem, Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, so her part took D + 18 minutes.

The total time for the meal was 98 minutes. So, the time taken by Betsy and Donovan together can be represented as:

D + (D + 18) = 98

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

2D + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2D = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

D = 40

So, Donovan took 40 minutes to make his part of the meal. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, Betsy's part took:

40 + 18 = 58 minutes

So, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long.

The final answer is \boxed{58}.</s>","Let D = Donovan's time in minutes
Betsy = D + <<+18=18>>18

2. Next, let's calculate the cost of the painkillers. Hannah takes 30 pills at $4 each. So, the cost for the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

3. Then, let's calculate the cost of parking. The doctor charges $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost for parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

4. Finally, let's add up all these costs to find the total cost of the doctor's visit. The total cost is $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $582.

1. James receives 80 emails a day.
2. 20% of these emails do not require a response. So, the number of emails that do not require a response is 20% of 80.

Emails not requiring response = 0.2 * 80 = 16

3. The remaining emails require a response. So, the number of emails requiring a response is the total number of emails received daily minus the number of emails not requiring a response.

Emails requiring response = 80 - 16 = 64
4. James works for 5 days a week. So, the total number of emails he responds to in a week is the number of emails requiring a response times the number of work days.

Total emails responded = 64 emails/day * 5 days/week = 320 emails/week

2. Next, we need to calculate the total cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents, so for 700 coupons, the cost is 700 * 5 = $35.

3. Similarly, we need to calculate the total cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, so for 1400 coupons, the cost is 1400 * 15 = $210.

2. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. So, Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches initially.
3. Then Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the remaining meatball sub sandwiches are 7 - 4 = 3.
4. Sidney then ordered another three sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had is 3 (remaining) + 3 (newly ordered) = 6.

The question asks for the number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches.

1. Mr Hezekiah has 20 trucks.
2. Each truck is carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.

5. These 5 trucks were supposed to deliver 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons of fertiliser.
6. Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is the total amount of fertiliser minus the amount that couldn't be delivered due to mechanical failures. That is, 400 tons - 100 tons = 300 tons.

So, The final answer is {300 tons of fertiliser reached the farmers that day}.</s>","If there were 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and 1/4 of the total number had mechanical failures, there were 1/4*20 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 failed deliveries.

                [/INST] Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen. So, for 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

At the grocery store, the promotion is buy one pound of butter and get one-half off. So for 6 pounds, he will be able to use this promotion for 5 of the pounds (since for each pound he buys, he gets one-half off of another half pound for free).

For the first 5 pounds, he will pay $4.00 for each pound, so that's 5 * $4.00 = $20.00. Then, for the next 1.5 pounds (which he gets for free), he doesn't have to pay anything. Finally, for the last 0.5 pound, he will pay the full price because he can't use the promotion on it. So that's $4.00 for 0.5 pound.

Adding these up, Dennis will spend $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00 for 6 pounds of butter.

{The final answer is $24.00.}</s>","1 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen so he needs 1*6 = <<1*6=6>>6 pounds of butter
The butter is $4.00 a pound and currently on sale for buy one get one half off so every unit of 2 pounds of butter will cost 4*1.5 = $<<4*1.5=6.00>>6.00
He needs 6 pounds of butter and the current promotion is for a unit of 2 pounds of butter so he needs to buy 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 units worth of butter
The sale price is $6.00 per 2 pounds of butter and he needs to buy 3 units of butter so 6*3 = $<<6*3=18.00>>18.00 worth of butter

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of guests.

Kayla invited her 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, so that's 25 + 7 = 32 guests. Then she invited 13 family members, so the total number of guests was 32 + 13 = 45 guests. However, 4 people couldn't come, so the total number of guests that will attend is 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the party.

The initial fee to rent the theater is $125, and there are 41 guests. The fee for each additional guest is $6, but since the party is already for 20 guests, we need to calculate the fee for the additional 21 guests. So the additional fee is 21 * $6 = $126.

Finally, we add the initial fee and the additional fee to find the total cost of the party. So the total cost is $125 + $126 = $251.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is $251}.</s>","Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class friends + 13 family members = <<25+7+13=45>>45 people invited.
Of the 45 people invited – 4 people cannot come = <<45-4=41>>41 people attending the party.
Of the 41 people attending – 20 are included in the fee = <<41-20=21>>21 additional guests not included in the fee.
The cost for 21 additional guests is 21 x $6 = $<<21*6=126>>126.
The total cost for the party is the $125 fee + $126 for additional guests = $<<125+126=251>>251.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into clear and simple steps:

1. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she had 3/4 of her original amount left. Since we know that she had $60 after spending a quarter, we can find out how much she originally had by dividing $60 by 3/4.
   $60 / (3/4) = $60 * (4/3) = $80
   So, Maggie originally had $80.

2. Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she had 2/3 of her original amount left. Since we know that she also had $60 after spending a third, we can find out how much she originally had by dividing $60 by 2/3.
   $60 / (2/3) = $60 * (3/2) = $90
   So, Riza originally had $90.

3. The total amount of money they had originally was $80 (Maggie) + $90 (Riza) = $170.

4. Since they each had $60 left after spending, the total amount of money they have left together is $60 (Maggie) + $60 (Riza) = $120.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{120}.</s>","Maggie spent $60/4 = $<<60/4=15>>15.
So, Maggie is left with $60 - $15 = $<<60-15=45>>45.
Riza spent $60/3 = $<<60/3=20>>20.
So, Riza is left with $60 - $20 = $<<60-20=40>>40.
Thus, they have a total of $45 + $40 = $<<45+40=85>>85 left.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to determine how many bananas are consumed by all three monkeys in a day. Since each monkey consumes a certain number of bananas per day, we can add these amounts together to find the total daily consumption.

2. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

3. Now we need to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day. We know that the three monkeys together consume the total number of bananas available for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas consumed in a week is 315 bananas.

4. To find the number of bananas consumed by the third monkey each day, we first need to find the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a week. They consume 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day. Over a week, they consume 24 \* 7 = 168 bananas.

5. Subtracting the number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas available gives us the number of bananas consumed by the third monkey in a week: 315 - 168 = 147 bananas.

6. Finally, to find the number of bananas consumed by the third monkey each day, divide the weekly consumption by the number of days in a week: 147 / 7 = 21 bananas.

Final answer: The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day. {The final answer is \boxed{21}}.</s>","Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.
The second monkey eats 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas a day.
So the first and the second monkey eat a total of 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 bananas each day.
Hence, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = <<45-24=21>>21 bananas each day.

                [/INST] Step 1: First, let's calculate the cost of the roses.
Jenny bought 15 roses, and each rose costs $2. So, the total cost of the roses is:
15 roses * $2/rose = $30

Step 2: However, the question also mentions that a dozen (12) roses cost $15. Since Jenny bought 15 roses, she actually bought 1 full dozen and 3 extra roses. The cost of the full dozen is $15, and the cost of the 3 extra roses is:
3 roses * $2/rose = $6
So, the total cost of the 15 roses is actually $15 (for the dozen) + $6 (for the extra roses) = $21.

Step 3: Now, let's find out how much money Jenny was left with after buying the roses.
She had five $5 bills, which means she had 5 * $5 = $25. After buying the roses for $21, she was left with $25 - $21 = $4.

Step 4: The question states that the florist only has quarters for change. A quarter is worth $0.25, so the number of quarters that Jenny leaves with is:
$4 / $0.25/quarter = 16 quarters

Final Answer: Jenny leaves with 16 quarters. {The final answer is 16.}</s>","Jenny has $25 because 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25

2. Calculate the revenue from burger planners:
   - Terry sells 9 burger planners for $11 each, so the total revenue from burger planners is 9 * $11 = $99

3. Calculate the revenue from sodas:
   - Terry sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so the total revenue from sodas is 20 * $1.50 = $30

4. Add up all the revenues to find the total money Terry makes:
   - Total revenue = Revenue from milkshakes + Revenue from burger planners + Revenue from sodas

1. The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes and stay in the station for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 30 minutes.
2. The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is at 50 minutes. The second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station, which is 20 minutes divided by 4, equal to 5 minutes.
3. The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is at 100 minutes (60 minutes from the first train, 40 minutes from the second train, as the second train left the station at 50 minutes, and an additional 50 minutes for the third train). The third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives, so it stays for 0 minutes.
4. The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is at 120 minutes (100 minutes from the first train, and 20 minutes for the gap). This is the train that Paul will board.

Now, we need to calculate how long Paul will wait for his train. Paul will be waiting from the time the first train arrives (10 minutes) until the time the fourth train arrives (120 minutes).

So, the total time Paul will wait for his train is 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes.</s>","The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.

It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.

1. The original price of the watch is $2000.
2. Mr. Roger's bought the watch at 75% of its original price. So, the price he paid for the watch is 75% of $2000.

Price Mr. Roger's paid = 75% of $2000

Price Mr. Roger's friend paid = 120% of $1500
= (120/100) * $1500

4. To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the price he paid, and then find what percentage this difference is of the original price.

Difference between original price and price paid by friend = $2000 - $1800

5. Percentage discount = (Difference / Original Price) * 100%

Percentage discount = ($200 / $2000) * 100%

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny buys:**
   Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch averages 4 bananas. So, the total number of bananas is:
   \[
   10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost per banana when bought individually:**
   Each banana costs $0.80. Therefore, the total cost if bought individually is:
   \[
   40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost per banana when bought in bunches:**
   Jenny buys 10 bunches at a total cost of $3.00 per bunch. Therefore, the total cost when buying in bunches is:
   \[
   10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the savings by buying in bunches:**
   The savings are the difference between the cost of buying individually and the cost of buying in bunches:
   \[
   \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00
   \]

Therefore, by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, Jenny saved $\boxed{\$2.00}$.</s>","Ten bunches makes 10*3=$<<10*3=30>>30.

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. We start with 100 feet of fence.

2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. Let's denote the amount of fence Harry gets as H, and the amount Sam gets as S. We know that H = S + 60.

3. We also know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet. So, H + S = 100.

4. Substituting H = S + 60 into the equation H + S = 100, we get (S + 60) + S = 100.

5. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 60 = 100.

6. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2S = 40.

7. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that S = 20.

8. So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

9. Therefore, the amount left over for Sam is the total amount of fence minus the amount Sam has. That is, 100 - 20 = 80 feet.

{The final answer is 80 feet.}</s>","Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100

We divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's find out how many of each type of bike Marcel sold.

Half of 300 is 150, so he sold 150 Trekking bikes.

15% of 300 is 45, so he sold 45 BMX bikes.

The rest were MTB bikes. 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

2. Next, let's calculate how much he earned from each type of bike:

He earned $450 * 150 = $67,500 from Trekking bikes.

BMX bikes cost half as much as MTB bikes, so each BMX bike costs $500 / 2 = $250.

So, he earned $250 * 45 = $11,250 from BMX bikes.

Each MTB bike costs $500, so he earned $500 * 105 = $52,500 from MTB bikes.

3. Finally, let's add up the earnings from all three types of bikes:

$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

So, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

{The final answer is $131,250}</s>","First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.

2. Calculate the total number of minutes spent on classes in a week:
   - Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total minutes spent on classes is 40 classes * 40 minutes = 1600 minutes.

3. Calculate the total number of minutes spent on extra learning time on the weekend:
   - He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday, which is 2 days.
   - The total minutes spent on extra learning is 1/16 * 1600 minutes = 100 minutes per day.
   - Since there are 2 days, the total minutes spent on extra learning is 100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes.

4. Calculate the total number of hours John spends learning in a week:
   - The total minutes spent on learning is 1600 minutes (classes) + 200 minutes (extra learning) = 1800 minutes.
   - To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

1. First, we need to determine the height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since each story in the mall is 24 feet high, and Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, the ball is dropped from a height of 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

2. Next, we need to calculate the height the ball reaches on its first bounce. The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. So, after the first bounce, the ball reaches a height of 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

3. Finally, we need to calculate the height the ball reaches on its second bounce. Again, the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height. So, after the second bounce, the ball reaches a height of 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The T-Rex ate half of the small Triceratops. Let's denote the total weight of the Triceratops as T. So, the T-Rex ate T/2 kilograms of meat.

2. After the T-Rex left, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. This means they ate T/4 kilograms of meat.

3. Then, a group of lazysauruses gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat.

To find out how much meat was left after the velociraptors scavenged from what the T-Rex left, we add the amount the T-Rex ate and the amount the velociraptors ate. This gives us T/2 + T/4 = 3T/4.

Since the lazysauruses gulped down the last 3T/4 kilograms, we can set up the equation:

3T/4 = 270

To solve for T, we multiply both sides by 4/3:

T = 270 * 4/3 = 360 kilograms

So, the T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, which was 360/2 = 180 kilograms of meat.

\boxed{180}</s>","The velociraptors left half for the Allosaurus, so the T-Rex left 2 * 270 = <<2*270=540>>540 kilograms of meat.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total area of the walls:

1. Area of north and south walls: 10 feet x 8 feet = 80 square feet each. Since there are two walls (north and south), the total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

2. Area of east and west walls: 5 feet x 8 feet = 40 square feet each. Since there are two walls (east and west), the total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

So, the total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Next, let's determine how many gallons of paint are needed:

1. Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet. To find out how many gallons are needed, divide the total area by the coverage of one gallon: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Finally, let's calculate the cost:

1. Each gallon of paint costs $12. So, to find the total cost, multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon: 12 x $12 = $144.

Therefore, it will cost {The final answer is $144} to paint the room.</s>","The north and south walls are 80 square feet each because 10 x 8 = <<10*8=80>>80
The east and west walls are 40 square feet because 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40

The East and west walls total 80 square feet because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
All the walls total 240 square feet because 160 + 80 = <<160+80=240>>240
He will need 12 gallons of paint because 240 / 20 = <<240/20=12>>12

What is ? the likelihood, ? expressed as ; a . percentage, ; that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from ! a ; shaken can?
                [/INST] The problem can be solved by following these steps:

1. First, we calculate the number of unshaken sodas left after Ellen took one: 12 (total) - 3 (shaken) = 9 unshaken sodas, and then subtract the one Ellen took, so we have 8 unshaken sodas left.

2. Next, we calculate the number of unshaken sodas left after Ellen's brother took two: 8 (unshaken) - 2 (taken by brother) = 6 unshaken sodas left.

3. Now, we calculate the probability that Ellen's friend will get sprayed with a shaken can. There are still 3 shaken sodas, and we know there are 6 unshaken sodas, so the total number of cans is 3 (shaken) + 6 (unshaken) = 9 cans.

4. Since the cans are assumed to be picked randomly, the probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans, which is 3 (shaken) / 9 (total) = 1/3.

5. To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%.

Final answer: The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is {33.33%}.</s>","First figure out how many unshaken sodas were in the case when Ellen left the room: 12 total sodas - 3 shaken sodas - 1 taken soda = <<12-3-1=8>>8 unshaken sodas.
Next, figure out how many unshaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 unshaken sodas.
Then figure out how many shaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 shaken sodas.
Now add the number of shaken and unshaken sodas to find the total number of sodas left when Ellen's friend came along: 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 sodas
Now divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas to find the decimal probability Ellen's friend gets sprayed: 2/8 = <<2/8=0.25>>0.25
Now multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .25 * 100 = <<.25*100=25>>25%

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together to find out how far apart they are from each other after 3 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the distance the first train travels in 3 hours.
The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it would cover a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time
= 60 miles/hour × 3 hours
= 180 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance the second train travels in 3 hours.
The second train is traveling at half the distance the first train travels per hour, which is 60 miles/2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it would cover a distance of:
Distance = Speed × Time
= 30 miles/hour × 3 hours
= 90 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours.
Total distance = Distance covered by first train + Distance covered by second train
= 180 miles + 90 miles
= 270 miles

So, the two trains are {The final answer is} 270 miles apart from each other after 3 hours.</s>","Since one train is traveling half the speed of the train traveling 60 miles an hour, that means that train is traveling 60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 miles an hour.
Therefore, to find the distance traveled each hour in total we add both trains' speed together for a total of 60+30=<<90=90>>90 miles traveled each hour.
This means that in 3 hours they will have traveled 90*3= <<90*3=270>>270 miles away from each other.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of days Billy is working. Since March has 31 days and Billy takes 20% of these days off, the number of days he works is 31 * (1 - 20%) = 31 * 0.8 = 24.8 ≈ 25 days (since we can't have a fraction of a day).

2. On each of these days, Billy works 3 hours. So, the total number of hours Billy works is 25 * 3 = 75 hours.

3. Billy can help 12 people per hour. So, the total number of people he helps is 75 * 12 = 900 people.

So, the final answer is \boxed{900}.</s>","First find the number of days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days

Then multiply that number by 80% to find the number of days Billy works: 50 days * 80% = <<50*80*.01=40>>40 days
Then find how many people Billy can help per day: 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = <<2*3=6>>6 people/day

1. **Calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide**:
   The biggest slide is 300 feet long and people slide down at a speed of 60 feet per minute. So, the time taken to ride the biggest slide can be calculated by dividing the length of the slide by the speed of sliding.
   Time = Length / Speed
   Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
   Time = 5 minutes

2. **Calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide**:
   The second biggest slide is 240 feet long and people slide down at a speed of 80 feet per minute. So, the time taken to ride the second biggest slide can be calculated by dividing the length of the slide by the speed of sliding.
   Time = Length / Speed
   Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
   Time = 3 minutes

3. **Calculate the difference in time**:
   To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, subtract the time taken for the second biggest slide from the time taken for the biggest slide.
   Difference in time = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
   Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
   Difference in time = 2 minutes

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

{The final answer is: It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.}</s>","First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = <<300/60=5>>5 minutes
Then find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = <<240/80=3>>3 minutes

1. **Calculate the total time Bobby spends on breaks each day.**
   Since Bobby takes a 15-minute break twice a day, the total time spent on breaks each day is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time Bobby spends on breaks over 5 days.**
   Since the total time spent on breaks each day is 30 minutes, over 5 days, the total time spent on breaks is:
   \[
   5 \times 30 = 150 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunches over 5 days.**
   Since Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch each day, over 5 days, the total time spent on lunches is:
   \[
   5 \times 30 = 150 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time Bobby spends on breaks and lunches over 5 days.**
   Adding the total time spent on breaks and lunches over 5 days gives us:
   \[
   150 + 150 = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Convert the total time into hours.**
   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time in hours is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time Bobby spends on breaks and lunches over 5 days is $\boxed{5 \text{ hours}}$.</s>","He has 2 15 minutes breaks per day so together they add up to 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 minutes
He also has a 30-minute lunch every day so together with his 30-minute break he has a 30+30 = 60-minute break each day
Every day his breaks total 60 minutes and he takes these breaks 5 days per week so he takes 60*5 = <<60*5=300>>300 minutes of break time

Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

\

3. Now, we know the total distance Ahito, Amber, and Micah ran together is 52 miles. We also know the distances Amber and Micah ran, so we can subtract these from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's distance = Total distance - Amber's distance - Micah's distance

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. Caroline is three times older than Ben. Let's denote Ben's age as B. So, Caroline's age (C) can be represented as C = 3B.

2. Ben is two times older than Chris. This can be written as B = 2X, where X is Chris's age.

3. We are given that Chris is 4 years old. So, X = 4.

4. Substituting X = 4 into the equation B = 2X, we get B = 2 * 4 = 8.

5. Now, we substitute B = 8 into the equation C = 3B, we get C = 3 * 8 = 24.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Lauren's annual contribution to her retirement savings is 20% of her current salary. Since her current salary is $100,000, her annual contribution is 20% of $100,000, which is $20,000.

2. Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current salary after 20 years. So, after 20 years, Lauren's lifestyle will cost 40% of $100,000, which is $40,000.

3. After 20 years, Lauren wants to save for a retirement period of 20 years. This means she needs to save enough money to cover her lifestyle for 40 years (the initial 20 years plus the 20 years of retirement).

4. Her total savings goal is 40 years * $40,000/year = $1,600,000.

5. Lauren is already contributing $20,000/year. She needs to know how many more years she needs to work to reach her goal of $1,600,000.

6. To find out how many more years she needs to work, we divide her total savings goal by her annual contribution: $1,600,000 / $20,000/year = 80 years.

7. Since Lauren is already accounting for 20 years, the additional number of years she needs to work is 80 years - 20 years = 60 years.

So, the final answer is Lauren needs to work for 60 more years to reach her savings goal, considering her current salary and savings rate.</s>","Lauren plans to live in retirement with 40% of her current salary ($100,000), therefore 40%*$100,000 = $<<40*.01*100000=40000>>40,000
If she wants to save for 20 years, then she will need to save 20 * $40,000 = $<<20*40000=800000>>800,000 to retire
If her current salary is $100,00 and she's saving 20%, then she's able to save $100,000 * 20% = $<<100000*20*.01=20000>>20,000 every year

1. First, we need to find out how long each of the initial cuts will be. Since Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he wants to cut into 4 equal parts, each initial cut will be 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm long.

2. Then, each of these initial cuts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. So, each final cut will be the length of one initial cut divided by 5.

Therefore, each final cut will be 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm long.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of boys, and this number is 240.

2. To find out what percentage the girls are, we subtract the percentage of boys from the total 100%. So, 100% - 40% = 60%.

3. Now, we want to find out how many girls there are. If 240 boys represent 40% of the school population, then the total school population can be found by dividing the number of boys by their percentage: 240 / 0.4 = 600 students in total.

4. Since 60% of the school population are girls, we multiply the total school population by 60% to find the number of girls: 600 * 0.6 = 360 girls.

So, the final answer is that there are 360 girls in the school. {The final answer is 360 girls}.</s>","100% - 40% = 60% of the school's population are girls.

                [/INST] To find the average height of the heels at the party, we first need to determine the total height of all the heels and then divide that by the total number of heels.

Step 1: Calculate the total height of the heels worn by the women with 4-inch heels.
Since there are three women wearing 4-inch heels, their total height is 3 (women) x 4 (inches) = 12 inches.

Step 2: Calculate the total height of the heels worn by the women with 2-inch heels.
Since there are three women wearing 2-inch heels, their total height is 3 (women) x 2 (inches) = 6 inches.

Step 3: Calculate the total height of all the heels at the party by adding the total heights calculated in steps 1 and 2.
Total height = 12 inches (from step 1) + 6 inches (from step 2) = 18 inches.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of heels at the party by adding the number of heels worn by women in steps 1 and 2.
Total number of heels = 3 (from step 1) + 3 (from step 2) = 6 heels.

Step 5: Calculate the average height of the heels by dividing the total height (from step 3) by the total number of heels (from step 4).

Then add the total number of inches from each group of heels to find the overall total: 12 inches + 6 inches = <<12+6=18>>18 inches
Then find the total number of women at the party: 3 women + 3 women = <<3+3=6>>6 women

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of hikes Soledad will take in June.
Since Soledad is planning to hike 9,300 miles in a month and will hike twice a day, we need to find out how many hikes she will take in a day. To do this, we divide the total number of miles by the number of miles she plans to cover in each hike:

9,300 miles / 125 miles per hike = 74.4 hikes

Since hikes are whole numbers, we can round up to 75 hikes (since rounding down would mean she won't reach her goal).

Step 2: Calculate the number of hikes Soledad will take in a month.
There are 30 days in June (assuming it's not a leap year), so we divide the total number of hikes by the number of days in June to find out how many hikes she will take in a day:

75 hikes / 30 days = 2.5 hikes per day

However, since it's unlikely she can realistically hike twice a day, we need to find out how many miles she must hike in each day to reach her goal.

Step 3: Calculate the number of miles Soledad must hike per day to complete her journey on time.
To do this, we divide the total number of miles by the number of days in June:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Step 4: Calculate the additional miles Soledad must hike per day.
To find out how many more miles Soledad must hike per day to reach her goal, we subtract the number of miles she plans to hike (125 miles) from the number of miles she must hike (310 miles):

310 miles per day - 125 miles per hike = \boxed{185} miles per day

So, Soledad must hike an additional 185 miles per day to complete her journey on time.</s>","June has 30 days, so Soledad must hike 9,300 miles / 30 days = <<9300/30=310>>310 miles/day

1. Revenue from selling red balls:
   - There are 3 red balls.
   - Each red ball costs $9.
   - So, the total revenue from red balls = Number of red balls * Cost per red ball
   - Total revenue from red balls = 3 * $9 = $27

2. Revenue from selling blue balls:
   - There are 11 blue balls.
   - Each blue ball costs $5.
   - So, the total revenue from blue balls = Number of blue balls * Cost per blue ball
   - Total revenue from blue balls = 11 * $5 = $55

3. Revenue from selling green balls:
   - There are 25 green balls.
   - Each green ball costs $3.
   - So, the total revenue from green balls = Number of green balls * Cost per green ball
   - Total revenue from green balls = 25 * $3 = $75

4. Total revenue:
   - Total revenue = Revenue from red balls + Revenue from blue balls + Revenue from green balls
   - Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

So, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold.

1. First, let's determine how many kilograms of apples Peter wants. Peter wants a quarter (1/4) of the total apples, which is 12 kg.

Kilograms for Peter = Total apples * 1/4
   = 12 kg * 1/4
   = 3 kg

So, Peter wants 3 kg of apples.

2. Next, let's determine how many kilograms of apples Paul wants. Paul wants 1/3 of the remaining apples after Peter took his share. The remaining apples after Peter's share is 12 kg - 3 kg = 9 kg.

Kilograms for Paul = Remaining apples * 1/3
   = 9 kg * 1/3
   = 3 kg

So, Paul wants 3 kg of apples.

3. Finally, to determine how many kilograms of apples Jacques will have left, we subtract the kilograms taken by Peter and Paul from the total apples.

Kilograms left for Jacques = Total apples - Kilograms for Peter - Kilograms for Paul
   = 12 kg - 3 kg - 3 kg
   = 6 kg

So, Jacques will have 6 kg of apples left.

\boxed{6}</s>","Peter wants 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 kg of apples.
Paul wants 12 * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 kg of apples.

2. To find out how long it takes to blink one time, we divide the time by the number of blinks. So, 5 minutes divided by 255 blinks equals 0.019608 minutes per blink.

3. Now, we want to know how long it will take to blink 459 times. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to blink one time by 459.

4. So, 0.019608 minutes per blink times 459 blinks equals 9 minutes.

Therefore, it will take {9 minutes} for the light to blink 459 times.</s>","The lighthouse blinks 255 / 5 = <<255/5=51>>51 times per minute.
It takes 459 / 51 = <<459/51=9>>9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

1. First, let's identify the number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate initially has in his garden pond:

- Male guppies: 4
   - Female guppies: 7
   - Male goldfishes: 3
   - Female goldfishes: 5

2. Next, let's identify the number of guppies and goldfishes Tate buys:

- Male guppies bought: 2
   - Female guppies bought: 1
   - Male goldfishes bought: 2
   - Female goldfishes bought: (not given in the question, so we can't calculate that)

3. Now, let's add the number of guppies and goldfishes Tate bought to his initial number:

- Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
   - Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
   - Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
   - Total female goldfishes: 5 + (not given) = (not given)

4. The question asks for the difference between the number of female guppies and the number of male guppies, which we have calculated as 8 and 6 respectively.

1. There are four people: Amalia, Megan, Dior, and the last person is not mentioned in your question. Let's call them 'X'.

2. Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

3. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog. So, Megan took 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

4. Dior took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry. Since the exact time is not given, let's assume Dior took 5 hours (as 'over 4 hours' can be interpreted as exactly 4 hours + 1 hour).

5. X's chore is not mentioned, so we'll assume X spent 'x' hours on their chore.

6. The total time spent by all four on their chores is Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time + X's time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 5 hours + x hours.

Unfortunately, the exact time 'x' is not provided for person X in your question. Therefore, we cannot calculate a specific total time without this information.

{The final answer is: The total time taken by Amalia, Megan, Dior, and X is 4 + 6 + 5 + x = 15 + x hours.}</s>","Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to do her work, a total of 4+2 = 6 hours.
Amalia and Megan's total time to finish their work is 6+4 = <<6+4=10>>10 hours.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the time it takes for John to drive to his parents' house and back (round trip).
   Since it takes him 2 hours to drive there, and he drives back with the same time, the round trip takes 4 hours (2 hours to go + 2 hours to come back).

2. Next, multiply the round trip time by the speed at which John drives to find the total distance he drives in one round trip.
   The distance is 70 mph * 4 hours = 280 miles.

3. Finally, to find out how many miles John drives in a month, multiply the total distance for one round trip by the number of times he visits his parents in a month.
   Since he visits his parents twice a month, the total distance he drives in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

                [/INST] First, we need to understand that 10 miles represents the daily distance that Sofie plans to walk.

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can represent Brian's distance as half of what Sofie walks.

So, Sofie's total distance in 7 days = 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.

Since Sofie walks twice as far in 7 days as Brian, Brian's total distance in 7 days = 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.

However, the question asks for Brian's daily distance. To find his daily distance, we divide his total 7-day distance by the number of days.

So, Brian's daily distance = 35 miles / 7 days = 5 miles/day.

The final answer is \boxed{5}.</s>","If Sofie walks 10 miles each day, she will walk 7*10 = <<10*7=70>>70 miles in seven days.

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 workers and they work for 10 hours.
2. Two of these workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another two produce 4 toys an hour.
3. After 10 hours, they still need another 20 toys to be able to ship the order.

Now, let's calculate how many toys the first four workers have produced:

1. The first two workers produce 6 toys an hour, so in 10 hours, they produce 6 * 2 = \boxed{12}.
2. The next two workers produce 4 toys an hour, so in 10 hours, they produce 4 * 2 = \boxed{8}.

In total, the first four workers produce 12 + 8 = \boxed{20} toys in 10 hours.

Since they still need another 20 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 20 (total toys needed) - 20 (toys produced by first four workers) = \boxed{0} toys to be able to ship the order.

However, this doesn't seem correct because we know that the fifth worker did indeed produce some toys. This is because the initial wording of the question seems to contain some contradictions or errors.

If we assume that the fifth worker produced 20 toys in total, then the rate at which the fifth worker produces toys per hour would be 20 (total toys produced by fifth worker) / 10 (hours worked) = \boxed{2} toys per hour.</s>","In the first group of workers, each produces 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys.
In the second group of workers, each produces 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys.
Together, these two groups produce 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys.
If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.
The fifth worker therefore produced 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.

3. Rob received 7 stickers, so Luis also received 7 stickers. Therefore, L = R = 7.

4. The problem also states that Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 to Rob. This means that Kris originally had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers, but these were half of what Luis had. So, Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.

2. Two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
3. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince.
4. So, if we let x represent Vince's age two years ago, then we can set up the equation: 14 = 2x.
5. Solving for x gives us Vince's age two years ago, which is x = 14 / 2 = 7 years.
6. To find out how old Vince is now, we add these two years back to his age, which gives us Vince's current age: 7 + 2 = 9 years.

So, {The final answer is: Vince is 9 years old now}.</s>","Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = <<16-2=14>>14 years old.

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.

2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.

3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted as A, the number of eggs Sarah painted as S, and the number of eggs Camden painted as C.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. A = A (Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)

2. C + S = 30 (Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)

3. C = S + 12 (Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

Now, let's solve these equations step by step:

From equation 3, we can substitute C in equation 2:

(S + 12) + S = 30

This simplifies to:

2S + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2S = 18

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 9

Now that we know S (the number of eggs Sarah painted), we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and we know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, we can say that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Arnold as well.

{The final answer is: Camden painted 12 more eggs than Arnold.}</s>","Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = <<56-30=26>>26 easter eggs.
Arnold and Madeline each painted 26/2 = <<26/2=13>>13 easter eggs.
Sarah painted (30 - 12)/2 = 18/2 = <<(30-12)/2=9>>9 easter eggs.
Camden painted 9 + 12 = <<9+12=21>>21 easter eggs.
Camden painted 21 - 13 = <<21-13=8>>8 eggs more than Arnold.

                [/INST] The rewritten problem in English with a step-by-step explanation of the solution is as follows:

Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, when there are 16 ounces to a pound?

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:
1. Calculate the number of crayons per box: 200 crayons divided by 8 crayons per box equals 25 boxes.
2. Calculate the weight of the crayons in each box: 8 crayons per box times 1 ounce per crayon equals 8 ounces.
3. Calculate the total weight of the crayons: 25 boxes times 8 ounces per box equals 200 ounces.
4. Convert the total weight of the crayons to pounds: 200 ounces divided by 16 ounces per pound equals 12.5 pounds.
5. Calculate the weight of all the boxes: 25 boxes times 8 ounces per box equals 200 ounces.
6. Convert the weight of all the boxes to pounds: 200 ounces divided by 16 ounces per pound equals 12.5 pounds.
7. Calculate the total weight of the crayons and boxes: 12.5 pounds (crayons) plus 12.5 pounds (boxes) equals 25 pounds.

The final answer is that the total weight of the crayons and boxes is 25 pounds. {The final answer is 25 pounds}</s>","First find how many boxes Nik needs. 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = <<200/8=25>>25 boxes.
25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = <<25*8=200>>200 ounces.
Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so 200 + 200 = <<200+200=400>>400 ounces.
400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = <<400/16=25>>25 pounds.

1. John cuts down an 80-foot tree.

2. He can make logs out of 80% of it. So, the total length of the logs he can make is 0.80 * 80 feet = 64 feet.

3. He cuts it into 4-foot logs. So, the number of logs he gets is 64 / 4 = 16 logs.

4. From each of those logs, he cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he gets is 16 * 5 = 80 planks.

5. He sells each plank for $

1. Valerie earns $5000 per month.

2. Valerie's brother earns twice as much as Valerie, so his salary is 2 * $5000 = $10000.

3. Their mother earns twice their combined salary. Their combined salary is $5000 (Valerie's salary) + $10000 (Valerie's brother's salary) = $15000. So, their mother's salary is 2 * $15000 = $30000.

4. To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add up all their salaries: $5000 (Valerie's salary) + $10000 (Valerie's brother's salary) + $30000 (their mother's salary) = $45000.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Grandma walks 3 miles every day. Her walk includes 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.

2. We also know that on the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the speed that she does on the beach. If we denote her speed on the beach as x miles/minute, then her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles/minute.

3. We are given that 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach, we can calculate her speed on the beach as 2 miles / 40 minutes = 1/20 miles/minute.

4. Now we can calculate her speed on the sidewalk as 2 * (1/20) miles/minute = 1/10 miles/minute.

5. To find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk, we divide the distance by her speed on the sidewalk: 1 mile / (1/10) miles/minute = 10 minutes.

6. Finally, to find the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

{The final answer is 50 minutes.}</s>","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.

                [/INST] The problem involves finding out how long it will take Jane to save $60 if she continues to save the same amount each week.

1. First, we need to find out how much Jane has saved each week. She has saved $4 of her allowance every week for the past 8 weeks. So, she saves $4/week.

2. Now, we need to find out how much she has saved so far. In 8 weeks, she has saved 4*8 = $32.

3. The total amount she wants to save is $60. So, the amount she still needs to save is $60 - $32 = $28.

4. Since she saves $4 each week, the number of weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28 is $28/$4 = 7 weeks.

So, Jane will need to save for 7 more weeks to reach her goal of $60.

1. We know that Donny can only drink water at least 40 degrees.
2. He has two mugs of water, one is 33 degrees and the other is unknown.
3. He pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle.
4. After this, he can drink the water from the water bottle.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x (in degrees).

5. When Donny combines the water from both mugs, he is combining 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of x-degree water.
6. The total amount of water in the water bottle is now 5 ounces (4 from the 33-degree mug and 1 from the unknown-degree mug).
7. To drink the water, the average temperature of the 5 ounces must be at least 40 degrees.

The formula to calculate the average temperature is: average temperature = (total heat)/(total mass)

8. The total heat is the sum of the heat from the 33-degree water and the heat from the x-degree water. The heat can be calculated as heat = mass * temperature.
9. So, the total heat in the water bottle is: (4 ounces * 33 degrees) + (1 ounce * x degrees)
10. The total mass is 5 ounces.

So, we have the equation for the average temperature as: (132 + x)/5 >= 40

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is:
   Eggs in 30 days = Eggs per day * Number of days
   = 3 * 30
   = 90 eggs

2. Then, for the next 30 days, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is:
   Eggs in 30 days = Eggs per day * Number of days
   = 5 * 30
   = 150 eggs

3. To find out the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days, we add the two amounts together:
   Total eggs in 60 days = Eggs in first 30 days + Eggs in next 30 days
   = 90 + 150
   = 240 eggs

4. Since 1 dozen eggs are equal to 12 eggs, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
   Total dozens = Total eggs / Eggs per dozen
   = 240 / 12
   = 20 dozens

So, Chester will need \boxed{20} dozens of eggs for 60 days.</s>","He starts off eating 3 eggs a day for 30 days for a total of 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 eggs
Then he increases it to 5 eggs a day for 30 days for a total of 5*30 = <<5*30=150>>150 eggs
All total he will eat 90+150 = <<90+150=240>>240 eggs
There are 12 eggs in 1 dozen and he will 240 eggs which is 240/12 = 20 dozen eggs

1. Jess can see that there are 17 green jelly beans and twice as many red jelly beans.
   This means there are 2 * 17 = 34 red jelly beans.

2. The rest of the jellybeans are blue. So, the number of blue jelly beans is equal to the total number of jelly beans minus the number of green and red jelly beans.
   This means there are 60 - 17 - 34 = 9 blue jelly beans.

The final answer is:

So in the green and red jelly beans, there are a total of 17 + 34 = <<17+34=51>>51 jellybeans.
As the rest are blue, there must be 60 total jellybeans – 51 red and green jelly beans = <<60-51=9>>9 blue jelly beans.

First, let's calculate the number of lemons collected from one tree in a year:
Lemons from one tree in a year = Lemons per tree * Number of trees
= 6 * 1
= 6 lemons

Next, let's calculate the number of lemons collected from one tree in a decade:
Lemons from one tree in a decade = Lemons per year * Number of years in a decade
= 6 * 10
= 60 lemons

Finally, let's calculate the total number of lemons collected from all trees in a decade:
Total lemons in a decade = Lemons from one tree in a decade * Number of trees
= 60 * 5
= 300 lemons

Therefore, Tim collects 300 lemons in a decade.

                [/INST] Let's denote the number of men on the bus as M and the number of women as W. According to the given ratio (5:9), for every 5 men, there are 9 women. This gives us the relationship:

M/W = 5/9

We also know that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84:

M + W = 84

We are also told that 20 women alight from the bus, so the number of women remaining on the bus would be:

W - 20

We want to find the number of women remaining on the bus after 20 women alight. To do this, we can first express M in terms of W using the ratio:

M = (5/9) * W

Now, we can substitute this expression for M into the total number of passengers equation:

(5/9) * W + W = 84

Combining like terms, we get:

(5/9) * W + (9/9) * W = 84

(14/9) * W = 84

Now, we can solve for W:

W = 84 * (9/14)

W = 54

So, there were 54 women on the bus initially. After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is:

54 - 20 = 34 {The final answer is}.

There are 34 women left on the bus.</s>","The total ratio representing the number of women on the bus is 5+9=<<5+9=14>>14
The fraction from the ratio representing the number of women is 9/14, and since the total number of passengers representing the full ratio is 84, there are 9/14*84=<<9/14*84=54>>54 women on the bus.
If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus becomes 54-20=<<54-20=34>>34

                [/INST] First, let's determine how many sunflowers Faraday sells each day from his total earnings. Since he sells each sunflower for $2 and earns $26 from sunflowers per day, we can find the number of sunflowers sold per day by dividing the total earnings from sunflowers by the price per sunflower.

Sunflowers sold per day = Total earnings from sunflowers / Price per sunflower
= $26 / $

2 \boxed{13}

Next, let's determine how many bouquets Faraday sells each day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earns $56 from bouquets per day, we can find the number of bouquets sold per day by dividing the total earnings from bouquets by the price per bouquet.

Bouquets sold per day = Total earnings from bouquets / Price per bouquet
= $56 / $8
= 7 \boxed{7}

We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so let's calculate the number of sunflowers in each bouquet.

Sunflowers per bouquet = \boxed{12}

Now, let's calculate the number of sunflowers Faraday sells each day in total. We know he sells 13 sunflowers individually and 7 bouquets, which contain 12 sunflowers each.

Total sunflowers sold per day = Sunflowers sold individually per day + Sunflowers sold in bouquets per day
= 13 + (7 \* 12)
= 13 + 84
= 97

Finally, let's calculate the number of sunflowers Faraday sells after 3 days.

Sunflowers sold in 3 days = Total sunflowers sold per day \* 3
= 97 \* 3
= 291 \boxed{291}</s>","Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.
So he was able to sell a total of 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 sunflowers from the bouquets.
And he was able to sell a total of $26/$2= <<26/2=13>>13 Sunflowers.
The sum of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell is 84 + 13 = <<84+13=97>>97.
Therefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 3 days is 97 x 3 = <<97*3=291>>291.

3. However, we're told that Adam only sells 60% of his inventory. So, he sells 60% * 20 = 12 rocks.

4. Now, let's calculate how much money he makes by selling 12 rocks for $7 each. That's 12 * $7 = $84.

                    John buys a cassette with 2 songs. .  ! The first song is 5 minutes and the second , song ; is ! 60% : longer.  How ? much . time was the total cassette?
                [/INST] First, let's find out how long the second song is. We know that the second song is 60% longer than the first one.

Longer song = Original song + (Original song * Percentage)
            = 5 minutes + (5 minutes * 0.6)
            = 5 minutes + 3 minutes
            = 8 minutes

Now we have the lengths of both songs, so we can add them together to find the total length of the cassette.

Total time = First song + Second song
           = 5 minutes + 8 minutes
           = 13 minutes

{The final answer is: 13 minutes.}</s>","The second song is 5*.6=<<5*.6=3>>3 minutes longer than the first

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of one device: Since Linus sells the device for twice the original price, the selling price of one device is $20 * 2 = $40.

2. Calculate the total cost of devices bought last Monday: Since he bought 2 devices and each costs $20, the total cost is 2 * $20 = $40.

3. Calculate the total cost of devices bought last Tuesday: Since he bought 4 devices and each costs $20, the total cost is 4 * $20 = $80.

4. Calculate the total cost of all devices bought: The total cost is the sum of the costs of devices bought on Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $

80 = $120.

5. Calculate the total selling price of all devices: Since the selling price of one device is $40, the total selling price of all devices is 2 (from Monday) + 4 (from Tuesday) = 6 devices * $40 = $

240.

6. Calculate the profit: The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

So, the final answer is {The final answer is $120}.</s>","The total cost for the devices he bought on Monday is 2*20= <<2*20=40>>40
The total cost for the devices he bought on Tuesday is 4*20 = <<4*20=80>>80
The total cost of these devices is 80+40= <<80+40=120>>120
Linus sold each mobile device he bought for $20 x 2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.
So, he earned $40 x 2 = $<<40*2=80>>80 for the two devices he bought last Monday.

1. First, we need to find out how tall Ned is. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and that Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 feet - 2 feet = 5 feet.

2. Next, we need to find out how tall Carl is. We know that Ned is 1 foot taller than Carl. So, Carl's height is 5 feet - 1 foot = 4 feet.

3. Finally, we need to find out the length of Carl's cane. We know that the cane is half as long as Carl is tall. So, the length of the cane is 4 feet / 2 = 2 feet.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Understanding the daily energy demand covered by one bottle of juice:**
   Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.

2. **Finding out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand:**
   If 20% of a person's daily energy demand is covered by one bottle, then to cover 100%, we would need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles.

3. **Calculating the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we would need 5 bottles per person. So, 2300 people require 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

4. **Determining how many more bottles need to be produced:**
   Currently, Hortex can produce 4200 bottles a day. To meet the requirement of 11500 bottles, they would need to produce an additional 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles.

So, Hortex would need to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juices to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. {The final answer is 7300}</s>","Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Carla has given birth to identical octuplets, which means she has eight babies.

2. Out of these eight babies, she dresses 3/4 in purple and 1/4 in blue. This means 6 babies are dressed in purple and 2 babies are dressed in blue.

3. All the blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple-wearers (which is 1 baby) also wear bows. So, in total, 3 babies are wearing bows.

4. Now, we want to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is also wearing purple.

The final answer is:

To find the percentage, we divide the number of babies wearing both purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and then multiply by 100.

So, (1 baby wearing both purple and bows / 3 babies wearing bows) * 100 = (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%

Then subtract the number of purple-wearing babies from the total number of babies to find the number of blue-wearing babies: 8 babies - 6 babies = <<8-6=2>>2 babies
Now divide the number of purple bow babies by the total number of bow babies to find the percentage chance a bow baby wears purple: 2 babies / (2 babies + 2 babies) = 2 babies / 4 babies = .5 * 100% = 50%

                [/INST] First, let's calculate how much land Abraham sold initially.

Half of the land is 80 square meters / 2 = 40 square meters.

He sold half of this land, which is 40 square meters / 2 = 20 square meters, for $50. So, the price per square meter for this part is 50 / 20 = $$25$.

After a month, he sold 1/4 of his land. The remaining land was 80 square meters - 20 square meters = 60 square meters. So, 1/4 of the land is 60 square meters / 4 = 15 square meters.

He sold this for $30. So, the price per square meter for this part is 30 / 15 = $$2/m^2$.

Finally, he sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. The remaining land was 60 square meters - 15 square meters = 45 square meters. So, the money he earned from this part is 45 * 3 = $135.

Adding up all his earnings, Abraham earned 50 (from the first sale) + 30 (from the second sale) + 135 (from the third sale) = $215.

The final answer is \boxed{215}.</s>","Abraham sold 1/2 x 80= <<1/2*80=40>>40 square meters of his unused land.
After a month, he sold 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 square meters of his land.
So, the total land he already sold is 40+10= <<50=50>>50 square meters of his land.
He has 80 - 50 = <<80-50=30>>30 remaining land to be sold at $3 per square meter.
So he earned $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90 for that land.

Now, let's add up all the fruits produced during the 10 years:

5-year-old: 50 fruits
6-year-old: 150 fruits
7-year-old: 450 fruits
8-year-old: X - 200 fruits (We need to find X before we can calculate this)
Ninth year: 0 fruits
10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Since a 10-year-old avocado tree produces 1000 fruits and this is 20 times the initial amount, we can deduce that the initial amount X is:

X = 1000 / 20
X = 50 fruits (This is consistent with the initial amount given for a 5-year-old tree)

Now we can calculate the fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree:

8-year-old: X - 200 = 50 - 200 = -150 fruits

However, the number of fruits cannot be negative, and since it is stated that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, we can assume that the avocado tree starts producing fruits during its fifth year. Therefore, the 8-year-old tree would not have produced any fruits yet. So, the actual total number of fruits produced during the 10 years is:

50 (5-year-old) + 150 (6-year-old) + 450 (7-year-old) + 0 (8-year-old) + 0 (9-year) + 1000 (10-year-old) = 1650 fruits

{The final answer is} 1650 fruits.</s>","At 5 years it produces 50 fruits
At 6 years it produces 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 fruits.
At 7 years, it produces 50 * 7 = <<50*7=350>>350 fruits
At 10 years, it produces 50 * 20 = <<50*20=1000>>1000 fruits
At 8 years, it produces 200 fewer fruits than at 10 years, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits
During 10 years, an avocado tree can produce a total of 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = <<50+150+350+800+1000=2350>>2350 fruits

1. Let's denote the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow ropes as R, B, and Y respectively.

2. From the problem, we know that R = 4B and Y = B + 7.

3. We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

4. Now, we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation: 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37.

5. Simplifying this, we get 6B + 7 = 37.

6. Subtracting 7 from both sides gives us 6B = 30.

7. Dividing by 6, we find B = 5. This is the length of the blue rope.

8. Now, we can find the length of the red rope (R) using the first equation: R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is \boxed{20} centimeters.</s>","Let Y = the length of the yellow rope in centimeters

                [/INST] First, let's denote Ronnie's initial amount of money as R, and Rissa's initial amount as 3R (since she was given thrice as much as Ronnie). After giving an equal amount to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which means she gives away 1/5 of her money. Since Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount, we can denote the amount they each gave away as X.

So, we have the equation:

3R - X = 4/5 * 3R

Solving for X gives us:

X = 3R - 4/5 * 3R
X = 3/5 * 3R
X = 9/5R

Now, we know that Ronnie gave away 9/5R. To find out how much money Ronnie is left with, we subtract the amount he gave away from his initial amount:

R - 9/5R = 5/5R - 9/5R = -4/5R

The negative sign indicates that the amount left is less than the initial amount, which is not possible since the problem states that Ronnie initially had $5. This suggests there might be a mistake in the problem statement or in the interpretation of the problem.

However, if we were to continue with the problem as stated, Ronnie's ""net loss"" would be 4/5R. Since Ronnie initially had $5, R = $5. So, his ""net loss"" would be -4/5 * $5 = -$4.

But remember, this is not a real loss because Ronnie still has the money he didn't give away. If we want to find out how much money Ronnie has left, we subtract the amount he gave away from his initial amount:

$5 - $4 = $1

So, if we ignore the logical inconsistency in the problem, Ronnie's money would be {The final answer is \boxed{1}}. But please note that this answer is based on faulty premises from the problem statement.</s>","Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.

                [/INST] To find out how many pints of red paint were used, let's break down the information given:

1. The mural has four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural.
3. Half of the mural is yellow.
4. The mural used 12 pints of paint in all.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's denote the amount of each of these colors as X. So, we have X pints of red paint, X pints of white paint, and X pints of purple paint.

Half of the mural is yellow, which means the other half is divided equally among red, white, and purple. So, in the half that is not yellow, we have X pints of red, X pints of white, and X pints of purple. Therefore, these half parts use 3X = X + X + X.

The total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is 3X. Since the yellow paint occupies half of the mural, we have 12*0.5 = 6 pints of yellow paint.

So, the total amount of paint used for the mural is the sum of the paint used for red, white, purple, and yellow, which is 3X (red, white, purple) + 6 (yellow) = 12 pints.

Therefore, 3X + 6 = 12. Solving for X, we get X = (12 - 6) / 3 = 2 pints of each of red, white, and purple.

So, the final answer is {The final answer is 2 pints of red paint were used}.</s>","Half the mural is yellow, so the other half took 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pints of paint.

                [/INST] Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the area of one bedroom. Given that each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

2. The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

3. The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

4. The total area of the house is the sum of the areas of all the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house. There are 4 bedrooms, so the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

5. Adding up all these areas, we get the total area of the house: 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.

1. Alice starts counting puffs of clouds with 3 puffs on Monday.

2. Each day, she counts double the number of clouds from the previous day.

So, if we start with 3 puffs on Monday, the number of puffs counted each day through Friday would be as follows:

Monday: 3 puffs
Tuesday: 6 puffs (since it's double the number from Monday)
Wednesday: 12 puffs (since it's double the number from Tuesday)
Thursday: 24 puffs (since it's double the number from Wednesday)
Friday: 48 puffs (since it's double the number from Thursday)

To find the total number of clouds Alice counted across all five days, we simply add up the number of puffs she counted each day:

3 puffs + 6 puffs + 12 puffs + 24 puffs + 48 puffs = {The final answer is 93 puffs}.</s>","On Monday Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds in the sky, and double that on Tuesday, 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 puffs of clouds.

On Thursday she sees twice that amount, 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 puffs of clouds.
On Friday she sees twice the amount of the day before, 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 puffs of clouds.
In total, across all five days, she sees 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = <<3+6+12+24+48=93>>93 total cloud puffs.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into several steps:

1. First, we need to determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run using a regular box of dishwasher pods at a cost of $

12. Let's call the number of pods per cycle ""P"" and the cost per pod ""C"". Since each pod costs $0.12 to buy, we have: C = $12 / 100 = $0.12
P = 100 / (number of cycles)

2. Now, let's consider the special size box that has 20% more pods for the same price. The number of pods in the special size box can be calculated as follows:

Special size box pods = 100 + (20% of 100) = 120

3. Since both boxes cost the same, the cost per pod remains the same: C = $0.12

4. Now, let's calculate the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run using the special size box for $1. We already know the cost per pod, so we can use that to find the number of cycles:

Number of cycles = (Special size box pods) / C
Number of cycles = 120 / $0.12 ≈ 1000

So, you can run approximately 1000 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box when using 1 pod per cycle.

\boxed{\text{The final answer is 1000}}</s>","If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods
If the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods
If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10
If 1 cycle costs $0.10, then for $1 I could run $1/$0.1 = 10 cycles

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he has, we divide the total amount by the denomination of the bills:
   Number of $20 bills = $1000 / $20 = 50 bills

2. Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he has:
   Remaining bills = 50 bills - 10 bills = 40 bills

3. Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, he has:
   Remaining bills = 40 bills / 2 = 20 bills

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills, and each bill is worth $20, if he triples his money, he doubles the number of bills and then multiplies them by 2 (since the value of each bill is $20):
   New number of bills = 20 bills * 2 = 40 bills

5. Finally, Thomas converts all his bills to $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide the total amount by the denomination of the new bills:
   Number of $5 bills = $1000 / $5 = 200 bills

So, \boxed{200} is the final answer.</s>","He withdrew 1000/20=<<1000/20=50>>50 bills

He triples his money which gives him 20*3=<<20*3=60>>60 bills

1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
2. Team B scores fewer than team A, so they score 2 goals.
3. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half, which is not possible since the number of goals must be an integer. There seems to be a mistake in the problem statement as it's not possible for a team to score a fraction of a goal. However, if we proceed assuming team A actually scored 0.5 goals in the second half:
4. Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so in the second half, team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Now the total number of goals scored in the match:

Team A scored 4 goals in the first half and 0.5 (or 1 if we assume it was rounded) goals in the second half.
Team B scored 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half.

So, the total number of goals scored in the match is (4 + 0.5) + (2 + 8) = 4.5 + 10 = 14.5

However, since a goal cannot be a decimal, and assuming the problem statement is incorrect regarding the 0.5 goal by team A in the second half, the total number of goals scored in the match would be 14 (rounding the 0.5 goal by team A to 1).</s>","In the first half, team B scores 4 goals - 2 goals = <<4-2=2>>2 goals.
The total number of goals scored in the first half is 2 goals + 4 goals = <<2+4=6>>6 goals

Team A 1/4 * 8 goals = <<1/4*8=2>>2 goals in the second half.

1. The teacher has a 5-inch piece of chalk and he uses 20% of it each day. On Monday, he started with a new piece and ended up using 45% of the chalk. So, let's find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday:
   Chalk used on Monday = Total chalk * Percentage used
   = 5 inches * 0.45
   = 2.25 inches

2. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles it when it is smaller than 2 inches. After recycling, the piece of chalk becomes a new one with 2 inches. After writing on Monday, the remaining chalk is:
   Remaining chalk = Total chalk - Chalk used on Monday
   = 5 inches - 2.25 inches
   = 2.75 inches

3. The teacher now has 2.75 inches of chalk left and he aims to use just 20% of it each day going forward. Let's find out how many days he can use this chalk:
   Days using chalk = Remaining chalk / Percentage used per day
   = 2.75 inches / (0.2 * 5 inches)
   = 2.75 inches / 1 inch
   = 2.75 days

4. Since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, we need to check if he has enough chalk for 2 days or it reaches recycling stage. For 2 days using 20% of chalk:
   Chalk used for 2 days = 2 * (0.2 * 5 inches)
   = 2 * 1 inch
   = 2 inches

5. The chalk used for 2 days (2 inches) is just enough to be recycled. Hence, the teacher has 2 days left before he has to recycle the piece.

\boxed{2}</s>","The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
Since 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.

                [/INST] Please correct me if my solution is not up to mark.

The class is composed of 12 boys and 12 girls.

Given that one-third of the girls and one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we can calculate the number of students on and not on varsity as follows:

Number of girls on varsity = (1/3) * 12 girls = 4 girls
Number of boys on varsity = (1/4) * 12 boys = 3 boys

Therefore, the total number of students on varsity is:

Total students on varsity = Number of girls on varsity + Number of boys on varsity
= 4 girls + 3 boys
= 7 students

Since the total number of students in the class is 12 boys + 12 girls = 24 students,

The number of students not on varsity is:

Number of students not on varsity = Total students - Students on varsity
= 24 students - 7 students
= 17 students

So, there are 17 students not on varsity. {The final answer is 17.}</s>","There are 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 students in Miss Albert's class.
12 x 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 girls are on varsity.
12 x 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 boys are on varsity.
A total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 students in Miss Albert's class are on varsity.
Therefore, 24 - 7 = <<24-7=17>>17 students are not on varsity.

1. Mike bought 5 face masks.
2. Three times as many as Mike would mean 3 * 5 = 15 face masks.

                [/INST] James initially has 30 teeth.

The dentist drills 4 teeth, so those 4 teeth are being worked on.

The dentist also caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so that's 7 + 4 = 11 more teeth that are being capped.

So, in total, the dentist fixes 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James had, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

So, the percentage of teeth fixed is (15 teeth fixed / 30 total teeth) * 100 = 50%.

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at the cost of $3.5 per gallon. So, the total cost of the milk is 4000 gallons * $3.5/gallon = ${14,000}.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.
Mr. Marcellus realized that 2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased had passed the expiry date. So, the amount of milk that passed the expiry date is 2/5 * 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

1. First, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

2. If we denote Colin's current age as C, then in 25 years, Colin's age will be C + 25.

3. Wendy's current age can be represented as W, and in 25 years from now, Wendy will still be older, so she will be W + 25.

4. According to the problem, Colin's age in 25 years (C + 25) will be a third Wendy's current age (W), or:
   C + 25 = W / 3

5. We also know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. In seven years from now, Colin will be C + 7, and Wendy will be W + 7.
   W = 5 * (C + 7)

6. Now, let's solve the equations. From the second equation, we can express W as:
   W = 5C + 35

7. Substitute W in the first equation:
   C + 25 = (5C + 35) / 3

8. Multiply by 3 to clear the fraction:
   3C + 75 = 5C + 35

9. Subtract 3C from both sides:
   75 = 2C + 35

10. Subtract 35 from both sides:
   40 = 2C

11. Divide by 2:
   C = 20

For the cheese pizza:
- Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- There are 12 slices in one whole cheese pizza.
So, the number of cheese pizzas one friend eats is $\frac{6}{12} = 0.5$ pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each friend eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- There are 8 slices in one whole pepperoni pizza.
So, the number of pepperoni pizzas one friend eats is $\frac{4}{8} = 0.5$ pizzas.

Since each friend eats 0.5 cheese pizzas and 0.5 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas one friend eats is $0.5 + 0.5 = 1$ pizza.

                [/INST] It seems like you're describing a scenario where Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. To find out how long it will take for Jay to have a total of 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds them and the rate at which they melt.

Let's break this down:

1. Jay can build 20 snowballs in 60 minutes (1 hour).

2. 2 snowballs will melt every 15 minutes. So, in 1 hour (60 minutes), 8 snowballs will melt (8 = 60 / 15 * 2).

Now, let's consider the net gain of snowballs per hour. Jay builds 20, but 8 melt, so his net gain per hour is 12 snowballs (20 - 8 = 12).

If Jay wants to have 60 snowballs, we can calculate how long it would take based on his net gain per hour:

Time needed = Total snowballs needed / Net gain per hour
           = 60 / 12
           = 5 hours

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs if he can keep up with the rate of building and melting.</s>","Every hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs.
At the same time, each hour 2 * 60/15 = <<2*60/15=8>>8 snowballs melt.
This means that each hour, Jay ends up with 20 – 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 more snowballs.
It will take Jay 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 hours to create enough snowballs.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that John is currently 28 years old.

2. We also know that when John was twice as old as Jim, they celebrated Digimon's 20th anniversary. This means that we need to find out how old John was at that time to determine Jim's current age.

3. Since John is twice as old as Jim right now, we can say that Jim's age is half of John's age right now. So, Jim's current age is 28 / 2 = 14 years.

4. However, we need to find out how old Jim was when Digimon had its 20th anniversary. Since we know John's current age, we need to subtract the age difference between the time of the Digimon anniversary and now from John's current age.

5. The number of years that have passed since the Digimon anniversary is the difference between John's current age and his age at that time. Since Jim was half as old as John at that time, we can say that the age difference between John and Jim is consistent. Therefore, we can say that John was half as old as he is now at the time of the Digimon anniversary.

6. So, John's age at the time of the Digimon anniversary was 28 / 2 = 14 years.

7. Since Jim was half as old as John at that time, Jim's age at the time of the Digimon anniversary was 14 / 2 = 7 years.

8. To find out how old Jim is now, we need to add the number of years that have passed since the Digimon anniversary to Jim's age at that time. The number of years that have passed is the difference between John's current age and his age at the time of the Digimon anniversary, which is 28 - 14 = 14 years.

9. Therefore, Jim's current age is 7 + 14 = 21 years.

So, the final answer is \boxed{21}.</s>","When Digimon came out John would have been 28-20=<<28-20=8>>8

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of slices Doxa ate as d, her sister ate as s, and her brother ate as b.

2. From the problem, we know that Doxa ate 1 slice (d = 1), her sister ate 1 more than her, so s = d + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, and her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so b = s + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3.

3. To find out how many slices they all ate, we simply add up the number of slices each of them ate. That is, d + s + b = 1 + 2 + 3.

4. Adding these together, we get 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

So, the final answer is \boxed{6}.</s>","Her sister ate 1 + 1 = <<1+1=2>>2 slices.
Her brother ate 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 slices.
They ate a total of 1 + 2 + 3 = <<1+2+3=6>>6 slices.

They . had 78 bandages ? left ? at the end of the third day. How many bandages did : they start with on , the ! first day?
                [/INST] Let's rewrite the problem and solve it step by step:

A nurses' station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages, which means they started with 50 (from the first bulk pack) - 38 (used) = 12 bandages remaining.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the day before, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages and had 12 (remaining from the first day) - 28 (used on the second day) = -16 bandages.

Since it's not possible to have -16 bandages, it means that the station must have had more bandages. So, instead of starting with 50 bandages on the first day, they must have started with 50 + 16 = 66 bandages.

However, this still doesn't account for all the bandages used on the third day. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which means they had 2 * 50 (from the third bulk pack) = 100 bandages. But they only used half a pack, which is 50/2 = 25 bandages.

So, at the end of the third day, they had 66 (from the beginning) + 50 (from the second bulk pack) - 28 (used on the second day) + 100 (from the third bulk pack) - 25 (used on the third day) = 103 bandages, which exceeds the 78 bandages they had left.

This suggests that there might be a mistake in the problem. Assuming that the problem is correct, and they had 78 bandages left, it means they must have started with more bandages. Let's denote X as the number of bandages they started with on the first day.

On the first day, they had X bandages and used 38, so they had X - 38 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 28 bandages, so they had X - 38 - 28 bandages left.

On the third day, they had 100 bandages, but they only used 25, so they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages left.

So, X - 38 - 28 = 75.

Solving for X, we get X = 75 + 38 + 28 = 141.

So, they must have started with 141 bandages on the first day.

\boxed{141}</s>","Let B be the number of bandages the nurses’ station started with.
On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 50, so they had B - 38 + 50 = B + 12 bandages left.
On the second day, they used 38 - 10 = <<38-10=28>>28 bandages.
Thus, at the end of the second day, they had B + 12 - 28 = B - 16 bandages left.
On the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used half a pack, so they used 50 / 2 = 25.
Thus, on the third day, they had B - 16 + 100 - 25 = B + 59 bandages left.
At the end of the third day, they had 78 = B + 59 bandages left.
Thus, on the first day, they started with B = 78 - 59 = <<19=19>>19 bandages.

1. Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches after the cut. Therefore, the length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.
2. The cost for the cut is $30 per inch, and she had 2 inches cut. So, the cost for the cut is 2 * $30 = $60.
3. The cost for the color is $40.
4. The total cost of her cut and color is the sum of the cost of the cut and the cost of the color, which is $60 + $40 = $100.

                [/INST] 1. First, let's calculate Jen's daily earnings. She works for 7.5 hours a day and her hourly rate is $1.5. So, her daily earnings would be:
Daily earnings = Hours worked per day * Hourly rate
= 7.5 * $1.5
= $11.25

2. Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings. She works 6 days a week, so her weekly earnings would be:
Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * Days worked per week
= $11.25 * 6
= $67.5

3. Jen also receives an additional $10 for complete attendance, so her weekly earnings including the attendance bonus would be:
Weekly earnings with bonus = Weekly earnings + Attendance bonus
= $67.5 + $10
= $77.5

4. Now, let's calculate her monthly earnings for April. There are 4 weeks in April, so her monthly earnings would be:
Monthly earnings = Weekly earnings with bonus * Number of weeks in April
= $77.5 * 4
= $310

5. Therefore, if Jen did not incur any absences for April, she will receive $310 from her job.

{The final answer is \boxed{310}}</s>","In a week, Jen works for 7.5 hours/day x 6 days = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours/week
So in a month, she works for 45 hours/week x 4 weeks = <<45*4=180>>180 hours.
180 hours of work is equal to 180 hours x $1.5 = $<<180*1.5=270>>270.
Since she has complete attendance, she will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280.

1. Earnings from doing laundry: Jason did his laundry once a week. In a two-week period, he would have done his laundry twice. So, his earnings from doing laundry would be:
   2 (times of doing laundry) * $3.00 (payment per laundry) = $6.00

2. Earnings from cleaning his room: Jason cleaned his room once. So, his earnings from cleaning his room would be:
   $1.50 (payment for cleaning his room)

3. Earnings from taking the trash out: Jason took the trash out twice. So, his earnings from taking the trash out would be:
   2 (times of taking the trash out) * $0.75 (payment for taking out the trash) = $1.50

4. Earnings from emptying the dishwasher: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times. So, his earnings from emptying the dishwasher would be:
   6 (times of emptying the dishwasher) * $0.50 (payment for emptying the dishwasher) = $3.00

Now, let's add all these earnings together to find Jason's total earnings:
$6.00 (from doing laundry) + $1.50 (from cleaning his room) + $1.50 (from taking the trash out) + $3.00 (from emptying the dishwasher) = $12.00

1. On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 trees in total.

2. Of these, he planted White Oak trees first. The number of White Oak trees he planted on the first day is not directly mentioned, but we can assume there were some. Let's represent this number as W.

3. He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak, so the number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted on the first day is 2W.

4. The total number of trees he planted on the first day is the sum of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees, which is W + 2W = 3W. Given that he planted 20 trees on the first day, we can solve for W:
   3W = 20
   W = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.67 (but since we can't have a fraction of a tree, let's round it to the nearest whole number, so W = 7)

5. So, he planted 7 White Oak and 14 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.

6. On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making the total number of White Oak trees planted 7 + 10 = 17.

7. For Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than the first day, which is 14 * 1.25 = 17.5. Again, rounding it to the nearest whole number gives us 18.

8. On the second day, he also planted the same number of trees as the first day, which is 20.

9. The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is the sum of trees planted on the first day (20) and the second day (20), which is 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the final answer is \boxed{40}.</s>","Mr. Julius planted 2 pine/oak * 20 oak = <<2*20=40>>40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.

1. Amy initially has two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each. So, she has 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

2. She also has three makeup sets that come with six eyeshadow colors each. So, she has 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

3. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had four colors. So, she loses 4 colors.

4. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Each makeup set comes with six colors, so she uses up 6 / 2 = 3 colors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of colors Amy has left:

1. Initially, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

2. After her sister steals one palette, she loses 4 colors, so she has 26 - 4 = 22 colors left.

3. After using up half of the colors from one makeup set, she uses up 3 colors, so she has 22 - 3 = 19 colors left.

1. Mattison is 60 inches tall.
2. His two-story house is 7 times as tall as he is.
3. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is.

Now, let's calculate the height of the second floor:

1. First, we calculate the total height of Mattison's house:
   Total height = Mattison's height * 7 = 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches.

2. Next, we calculate the height of the first floor:
   First floor height = Mattison's height * 3 = 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches.

3. Now, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:
   Second floor height = Total height - First floor height = 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.

4. The roof from the second floor's floor is the same height as the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many shells were found by team Alphas. Since it's given that they found 40% of the shells, we can calculate this by multiplying 40% (or 0.4) by the total number of shells, which is

700. So, Alphas found 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

2. Next, we need to find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their share. To do this, we subtract the number of shells found by Alphas from the total number of shells. So, 700 - 280 = 420 shells were left.

3. Then, team The finders found 60% (or 0.6) of the remaining shells. So, they found 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

4. Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells. So, 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 shells.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we know that Bernie has 4 dogs.
2. We also know that each dog needs a certain amount of exercise per day.
3. The second dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.
4. The third dog needs to walk 3 miles per day.
5. On average, they need to walk 3.1 miles per day.

Now, we want to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk. To do this, we can set up an equation:

Exercise needed by dog 1 + Exercise needed by dog 2 + Exercise needed by dog 3 + Exercise needed by dog 4 = Total exercise needed

Let's denote the exercise needed by the first dog as x (since it's not given directly, it could be any amount). We know that the second and third dogs need 4 and 3 miles respectively. We also know that the total exercise needed (for all dogs) is equal to 4 times the average exercise needed (3.1 miles), because there are 4 dogs.

So, we can write our equation as:

x + 4 + 3 + y = 4 * 3.1

Here, y is the exercise needed by the last dog.

Solving for y, we get:

y = 4 * 3.1 - (x + 4 + 3)
y = 12.4 - (x + 7)
y = 5.4 - x

Since we don't have the exact amount of exercise needed by dog 1 (x), we can't provide an exact numerical answer. However, we've found a formula to calculate the exercise needed by dog 4 (y) based on the exercise needed by dog 1 (x).

{The final answer is:}

The last dog needs to walk 5.4 - x miles per day, where x is the amount of exercise needed by the first dog.</s>","The total walk distance must be 12 miles because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12

3. He uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts. So, the amount he uses to pay off his debts is $60,000 ($100,000 * 0.6 = $60,000).
4. After paying off his debts, the amount of money he has leftover is the remaining part of his loan, which is $90,000 ($100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000).

2. We also know that a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50.

3. To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we need to first find the total weight of the tunas and then multiply it by the cost per kilogram.

4. The total weight of the tunas is the sum of the weights of the three tunas: 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

3. The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which means it removes 2 liters per day.
4. The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which means it removes 4 liters per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water removed in each setting:

1. In 3 days on the low setting, the dehumidifier would remove 3 * 1 = 3 liters of water.
2. In 3 days on the medium setting, the dehumidifier would remove 3 * 2 = 6 liters of water.
3. In 5 days on the high setting, the dehumidifier would remove 5 * 4 = 20 liters of water.

Now, we add the amounts of water removed in each setting to find the total amount of water removed:

Total water removed = Water removed on low setting + Water removed on medium setting + Water removed on high setting
                    = 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters

How much ? will Stephen pay ; in . the . twelfth month?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Calculate the Interest**: First, we need to calculate the interest on the $300. The interest rate is 2%, so the interest is calculated as follows:
   - Interest = Principal * Rate
   - Interest = $300 * 0.02
   - Interest = $6

2. **Initial Total Due**: Add the original loan amount to the interest:
   - Total Due = Principal + Interest
   - Total Due = $300 + $6
   - Total Due = $306

3. **Calculate Monthly Payments**: Stephen is paying $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he pays is:
   - Total Paid in 11 Months = $25 * 11
   - Total Paid in 11 Months = $275

4. **Calculate Remaining Amount**: Subtract the total paid in 11 months from the initial total due to find how much is left to pay in the twelfth month:
   - Remaining Amount = Total Due - Total Paid in 11 Months
   - Remaining Amount = $306 - $275
   - Remaining Amount = $31

So, in the twelfth month, Stephen will pay $\boxed{$31}$.</s>","Stephen will pay an additional $300 x 2/100 = $<<300*2/100=6>>6.
He should return a total of $300 + $6 = $<<300+6=306>>306.
For eleven months Stephen will pay a total of $25 x 11 = $<<25*11=275>>275.
Therefore, Stephen will pay 306 - 275 = $<<306-275=31>>31 on the twelfth month.

Step 2: Determine how many diaper changes Jordan's wife changes.
Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so:
Diaper changes by Jordan's wife = Total diaper changes * 0.5
Diaper changes by Jordan's wife = 10 * 0.5 = 5

Step 3: Calculate how many diaper changes Jordan changes.
Diaper changes by Jordan = Total diaper changes - Diaper changes by Jordan's wife

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar. Since the jar is a square-based prism, we can calculate the volume by multiplying the area of the base (side length squared) by the height. In this case, the base is 6 inches by 6 inches and the height is 15 inches. So, the volume is (6*6)*15 = 540 cubic inches.

2. Next, we need to find out how many jelly beans can fit into this volume given that each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches and the packing efficiency is 80%. So, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is (540 / 0.15) * 0.8 = 3200 jelly beans.

3. The problem states that 30% of the jelly beans in the jar are red. So, the total number of red jelly beans should be 3200 * 0.3 = 960.

4. The final answer is the difference between the actual number of red jelly beans (900) and the estimated number (960). So, the difference is 960 - 900 = 60.

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 60 jelly beans. {The final answer is 60}.</s>","The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches
That means it can fit 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans
With 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there
So that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red
So his guess is off by 900-864=<<900-864=36>>36

1. The bus has a capacity of 200 people.
2. Initially, it had 20 people on it.
3. At the first stop, 40 more people entered the bus, making the total 20 + 40 = 60 people.
4. On the second station, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first station entered again. That's 3/4 * 40 = 30 people. So, after the second station, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90 people.
5. If the number of passengers doubled at the third station, that means there were 90 people on the bus before doubling, and now there should be 90 * 2 = 180 people on the bus.
6. The bus can hold a total of 200 people, so the number of people needed to fill the remaining spaces is 200 - 180 = 20 people.

So, the final answer is {20 people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus}.</s>","If the number of passengers increased by 3/4 times the number that entered the bus on the first station, 3/4 * 40 people = <<3/4*40=30>>30 people entered the bus on the second station.
After the second station, the number of people on the bus was 20 people initially on the bus + 40 who entered at the first station + 30 who entered at the second station= <<20+40+30=90>>90 people.
The number of people doubled at the third station, which is 90 people * 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 people.
If the bus has a capacity of 200, the number of people required to fill the bus is 200 people - 180 people = <<200-180=20>>20 people

How , much ; did Pauline spend on all visits to the museum?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Visits Cost**: Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. The cost for one visit is $2.

2. **Total Cost for One Year**: To find the total cost for one year, multiply the number of visits by the cost per visit.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost for One Year} = 3 \text{ visits} \times \$2/\text{visit} = \$6/\text{year}
   \]

3. **Cost Increase Over 5 Years**: The cost of one visit increases by 150% over 5 years. This means the cost is tripled (100% + 150% = 250%, or a factor of 3).

4. **New Yearly Visits Cost**: Since the cost is tripled, the new cost per visit is $2 \times 3 = \$6/\text{visit}$.

5. **New Total Cost for One Year with Increased Fees**: Now, calculate the new total cost per year with the increased fees.
   \[
   \text{New Total Cost for One Year} = 3 \text{ visits} \times \$6/\text{visit} = \$18/\text{year}
   \]

6. **Total Cost for 5 Years at Initial Rate**: Calculate the total cost for 5 years at the initial rate.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost for 5 Years at Initial Rate} = 5 \text{ years} \times \$6/\text{year} = \$30
   \]

7. **Total Cost for 3 Years at Increased Rate**: Calculate the total cost for 3 years at the increased rate.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost for 3 Years at Increased Rate} = 3 \text{ years} \times \$18/\text{year} = \$54
   \]

8. **Total Cost Over the 8 Years**: Add the total cost for the first 5 years at the initial rate to the total cost for the next 3 years at the increased rate.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost Over 8 Years} = \$30 + \$54 = \$84
   \]

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $\boxed{\$84}$ on all visits to the museum over the 8 years.</s>","Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.
That means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.
After 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.
That means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.
So for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
During the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
In total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.

1. First, we need to figure out how many students can try the escape room in total. There are students in grades 4 through 7, and we're told that there are 10 students with the most points in each grade.

2. So, we multiply the number of grades (4) by the number of students per grade (10) to get the total number of students who can try the escape room: 4 * 10 = 40 students.

3. Next, we learn that only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. So, we need to find out how many groups of 8 we can make from our total of 40 students: 40 / 8 = 5 groups.

4. Now, we know that each group has 45 minutes to try and escape the room.

5. To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to multiply the number of groups (5) by the number of minutes each group has (45): 5 * 45 = 225 minutes or 3 hours and 45 minutes.

So, the total cost of the tables = Cost of one table * Number of tables = $20 * 4 = $80

2. Calculate the cost of the roof frames:
Cost of one roof frame = $10
Number of roof frames = 2
So, the total cost of the roof frames = Cost of one roof frame * Number of roof frames = $10 * 2 = $20

3. Add the costs of the tables and roof frames together to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
Total amount = Cost of tables + Cost of roof frames = $80 + $20 = $100

So, \boxed{100} is the final answer. Ali has to pay John $100.</s>","For the wooden table, Ali should pay: $20 * 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80

Next, we know that the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. If the shorter piece is 20 feet (half of the board), then the longer piece is 4 * 20 feet = 80 feet long.

Therefore, \boxed{80} is the length of the longer piece.</s>","Let x be the length of the shorter piece.
The two pieces are 4x and x in length.
The equation is 4x + x = 40 when the lengths of the two boards are added.

Then dividing 40 by 5 gives the value of x which is <<40/5=8>>8.
Since x =8, the longer piece is 4*8 = 32.

                [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many pounds of ground beef Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs.
Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can calculate the number of pounds of ground beef he needs by dividing the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound.

Pounds of ground beef = Total meatballs / Meatballs per pound
= 80 / 16
= 5 pounds

Step 2: Determine how much of his secret seasoning Aiden needs.
Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can calculate the amount of secret seasoning he needs by multiplying the number of pounds by the amount of seasoning per pound.

Amount of secret seasoning = Pounds of ground beef * Seasoning per pound

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of the call in two parts due to the change in price after a certain number of minutes.

1. First, let's calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes. The cost per minute is $0.25, so for 16 minutes, the cost would be 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00.

2. Next, let's calculate the cost for the remaining time of the call. The total call time is 36 minutes, and we've already calculated the cost for the first 16 minutes, so the remaining time is 36 minutes - 16 minutes = 20 minutes. The cost per minute during this period is $0.2, so for 20 minutes, the cost would be 20 minutes * $0.2/minute = $4.00.

3. Finally, let's add the costs from both periods to get the total cost of the call. The total cost is $4.00 (first 16 minutes) + $4.00 (remaining 20 minutes) = $8.00.

\boxed{8.00}</s>","First 16 minutes would be a cost of 16 * 0.25 = $<<16*0.25=4>>4.
After that, there are 36 - 16 = <<36-16=20>>20 minutes of the call left.
And these 20 minutes cost 20 * 0.2 = $<<20*0.2=4>>4.
So in total, the 36-minute call would cost 4 + 4 = $8.

                [/INST] To solve the problem, we need to find out how much rain is expected on Tuesday based on the given information. 

1. On Monday, it rained 2 inches.

2. On Tuesday, it is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice the amount of Monday's rain.

Let's break down the calculation:

- First, we need to find twice the amount of Monday's rain. Twice of 2 inches is $2 \times 2 = 4$ inches.
- Then, we add 1 inch to this amount to find the expected rainfall on Tuesday: $4 + 1 = 5$ inches.

Therefore, there will be $\boxed{5}$ inches of rain on Tuesday.</s>","Twice as much rain as Monday is 2 inches * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 inches
It will rain 1 more inch than this value on Tuesday so 4 inches + 1 = <<4+1=5>>5 inches on Tuesday

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. Then we can write the relationship between B and C as: B = 3C - 2

2. Each person in the class gets two treats. Since there are five people in the class, the total number of treats will be 5 * 2 = 10.

3. The total number of treats is equal to the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies. So, we can write the equation C + B = 10.

4. Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation to solve for C: C + (3C - 2) = 10

5. Simplifying the equation gives us: 4C - 2 = 10

6. Adding 2 to both sides gives us: 4C = 12

7. Dividing both sides by 4 gives us: C = 3

So, Carly made \boxed{3} cupcakes.</s>","First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats
Next, express the number of brownies in terms of the number of cupcakes based on the problem information: b = 3c - 2, where b is the number of brownies and c is the number of cupcakes
We know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10
Now we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10
We add two to both sides of the equation to get 4c = 12
Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to get c = 3

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure before the discount is applied.

Cost of manicure = $35
Cost of pedicure = $40

Next, we calculate the discount on both services. Since the discount is 20% off, we calculate the discount amount by multiplying the total cost of both services by the discount percentage.

Discount amount = (Cost of manicure + Cost of pedicure) * Discount percentage
Discount amount = ($35 + $40) * 0.20
Discount amount = $75 * 0.20
Discount amount = $15

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost of both services to get the discounted price.

Discounted price = Cost of manicure + Cost of pedicure - Discount amount
Discounted price = $35 + $40 - $15
Discounted price = $75 - $15
Discounted price = $60

Next, we calculate the cost of adding nail art to each of her fingers. Since there are 10 fingers in total, and the cost is $3 per nail, we multiply the number of nails by the cost per nail.

Cost of nail art = Number of nails * Cost per nail
Cost of nail art = 10 * $3
Cost of nail art = $30

Finally, we add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of nail art to get the total amount Karen would pay.

Total amount = Discounted price + Cost of nail art
Total amount = $60 + $30
Total amount = $90

So, the final answer is {Karen would pay $90 in all}.</s>","The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.
The discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.

The cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.
Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.

                [/INST] To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he has traveled in 3 days.

First, we need to find out how many hours Michael traveled in 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/hr.

Days = 3
Average speed = 50 km/hr

Total hours = Days * Average speed = 3 * 50 = 150 hours

Next, we calculate the distance Michael covered in 3 days.

Distance covered = Total hours * Average speed = 150 * 50 = 7500 km

Finally, we calculate the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael covered.

Percentage of distance covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Total distance = 6000 km

Percentage of distance covered = (7500 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 125%

This seems incorrect, as Michael can't cover more than 100% of the distance in a straight line without making multiple trips. Let's re-calculate with the correct logic.

First, we need to find out how many hours Michael traveled in 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/hr.

Days = 3
Average speed = 50 km/hr

Total hours = Days * Average speed = 3 * 50 = 150 hours

Next, we calculate the distance Michael covered in 3 days.

Distance covered = Total hours * Average speed = 150 * 50 = 7500 km

However, this is incorrect as well, since it assumes that Michael does not make any stops. The distance between Alaska and Texas is larger than the distance Michael can cover in 3 days without stopping. Therefore, the problem seems to have an error.

{The final answer is: The problem has an error and cannot be solved as stated.}</s>","There are 24 hours in each day, so he has been traveling for a total of 3*24 = <<24*3=72>>72 hours

1. We know that their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies.
2. The pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie, so the mother used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
3. Before their mother made the pies, there were 48 grapes left.
4. Madeline's brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of grape juice.
5. Therefore, the total number of grapes used by Madeline's brother and Madeline is 48 + Madeline's grapes + Madeline's brother's grapes = 48 + 6 + 5*6 = 84 grapes.
6. To find the initial number of grapes, we subtract the number of grapes Madeline ate and the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother.

3. To replace the sick teachers, 9 substitute teachers were called in.

So, to find the number of teachers who were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Number of teachers at school = Total teachers - Sick teachers + Substitute teachers
                                       = 82 - 13 + 9

1. Bud spends $1.00 on pasta each week. In a year, with 52 weeks in a year, he would spend 52 * $1.00 = $52.00 on pasta.

2. Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese each week. In a year, he would spend 52 * $3.00 = $156.00 on cheddar cheese.

3. Bud spends twice the amount he spends on cheddar cheese on gruyere cheese. So, he spends 2 * $3.00 = $6.00 on gruyere cheese each week. In a year, he would spend 52 * $6.00 = $312.00 on gruyere cheese.

4. To find the total amount Bud spends on macaroni and cheese in a year, we add up all his expenses: $52.00 (pasta) + $156.00 (cheddar cheese) + $312.00 (gruyere cheese) = $518.00.

1. We know that the custodian has 5 days to clean 80 classrooms.
2. Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean.
3. The custodian works an 8 hour day, which is equivalent to 480 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).
4. To find out how many classrooms the custodian can clean in a day, we divide the total time they work by the time it takes to clean one classroom:
   Classrooms cleaned in a day = Total time / Time per classroom
   = 480 minutes / 15 minutes per classroom
   = 32 classrooms per day
5. To find out how much time is spent cleaning classrooms on average, we multiply the number of classrooms cleaned in a day by the time it takes to clean one classroom:
   Time spent cleaning in minutes = Classrooms cleaned per day * Time per classroom
   = 32 classrooms * 15 minutes per classroom
   = 480 minutes
6. Finally, to find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the time spent cleaning by the total time they work and multiply by 100:

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 20 books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.
4. Therefore, the total capacity of one bookcase is 10 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 45 books.
5. Elly has 110 books in total.
6. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of each bookcase: 110 / 45.

After calculating, the answer is not a whole number. However, since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all books are accommodated.

However, since the question asks for the number of bookcases and it's not possible to have a fraction of a bookcase, we must have made a misinterpretation of the problem. Let's reconsider the capacity of each shelf:

1. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.
4. Therefore, the total capacity of one bookcase is 10 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 45 books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, let's divide the total number of books by the capacity of each bookcase: 110 / 45 ≈ 2.44.

As expected, we get a non-integer value. However, since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all books are accommodated.

1. Calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought.
   - Rose bought five dozens of eggs.
   - One dozen eggs cost $2.40.
   - Therefore, the total cost is 5 * $2.40 = $\boxed{12}

2. Calculate the total revenue Rose will get from selling the eggs.
   - Rose will sell the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs.
   - There are 12 eggs in one dozen.
   - Therefore, she will sell 12 eggs for 12 / 3 = $4
   - Since she bought 5 dozens, she will sell 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.
   - So, the total revenue is 60 eggs / 3 eggs = $20 for every 3 eggs
   - Therefore, the total revenue is 60 eggs / 3 eggs * $4 = $\boxed{80}

3. Calculate Rose's profit.
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $80 - $12 = $\boxed{68}

Therefore, Rose's profit will be $68.</s>","Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.
Five dozens of eggs is equal to 12 x 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 eggs.

                [/INST] First, determine the total number of hats Skyler has, which is given as 100. We need to find out how many white hats he has.

To do this, we can first divide the total number of hats by 2 to find out how many red hats he has:

Number of red hats = Total number of hats / 2
Number of red hats = 100 / 2
Number of red hats = 50

Next, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the red ones:

Remaining hats = Total number of hats - Number of red hats
Remaining hats = 100 - 50
Remaining hats = 50

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining hats are blue. We are given that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so we can calculate this as follows:

Number of blue hats = Remaining hats * (3/5)
Number of blue hats = 50 * (3/5)
Number of blue hats = 30

Finally, we can find out how many white hats Skyler has by subtracting the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:

Number of white hats = Remaining hats - Number of blue hats
Number of white hats = 50 - 30
Number of white hats = 20

Therefore, \boxed{20} white hats are on Skyler's hand.</s>","If half of the hats are red, there are 1/2*100= <<1/2*100=50>>50 red hats.

The discount is on the total price of $18.00, so the price after the discount is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost of one stick.
Each bag contains 30 sticks, so the cost of one stick is $15.00 / 30 = $0.50

1. **Calculate the total number of questions across both tests**: Audrey has two tests, with the first test having 70 questions and the second test having 40 questions. Therefore, the total number of questions is calculated as follows:
   \[
   70 + 40 = 110
   \]
   So, there are 110 questions in total across both tests.

2. **Determine the minimum number of correct answers needed to pass**: To pass into the 7th grade, Audrey must correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions is 110, so the minimum number of correct answers needed is:
   \[
   110 \times 0.7 = 77

   Therefore, Audrey needs to answer a minimum of 77 questions correctly across both tests.

3. **Calculate the number of correct answers needed on the second test**: Audrey got 60% of the 70 questions on the first test correct, which is:
   \[
   70 \times 0.6 = 42

   So, Audrey answered 42 questions correctly on the first test. To meet the minimum requirement of 77 correct answers across both tests, the number of correct answers needed on the second test is:
   \[
   77 - 42 = 35

                [/INST] Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B.

According to the problem, we have two equations:

1) B = 5S - 4 (The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4)
2) S + B = 116 (The total number of ice cubes is 116)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

S + 5S - 4 = 116
6S - 4 = 116
6S = 120
S = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to solve for B:

B = 5(20) - 4
B = 100 - 4
B = 96

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

\boxed{96}</s>","Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.
Substituting the first equation into the second, we get s + 5s - 4 = 116.
Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116
Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120
Dividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20
Substituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96

                [/INST] Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. Jason needs to sell 15 cars to earn his bonus.

2. He knows that for every 25 telephone calls he makes to potential customers, he gets one person to come into the car dealership to look at new cars.

3. And for every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car.

Now, we need to find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars.

First, let's find out how many customers need to visit the dealership for Jason to sell 15 cars. Since one out of every two customers buys a car, we can calculate the number of visitors by multiplying the number of cars by 2:

15 cars * 2 = 30 visitors

Next, we can find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 visitors. Since he gets one visitor for every 25 calls, we can calculate the number of calls by multiplying the number of visitors by 25:

30 visitors * 25 = 750 calls

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

Final answer: {750}</s>","If it takes 2 customers to make one sale, then to get his 15 sales Jason will need 2*15=<<2*15=30>>30 customers to come into the car dealership.
Since Jason needs to make 25 telephone calls to get one person to come into the dealership, to get 30 customers, Jason must make 25*30=<<25*30=750>>750 telephone calls.

1. Brianna's house has 8 rooms.
2. There are 4 people in the house, including Brianna.
3. Each person carries a flashlight, so that's 4 flashlights in total.
4. There are two flashlights for each room, so that's 8 flashlights for the rooms.
5. Half the rooms have 4 small candles each. Since there are 8 rooms, half would be 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms * 4 small candles = 16 small candles.
6. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each. Again, with 8 rooms, half would be 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms * 5 medium candles = 20 medium candles.

Adding all these up:

- Flashlights: 4 (for people) + 8 (for rooms) = 12 flashlights
- Candles: 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles

So, Brianna's family uses 12 flashlights and 36 candles when the lights go out.

The final answer is: They are using 12 flashlights and 36 candles.</s>","For every one of the 8 rooms in the house, there are 2 flashlights, 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 flashlights.

Total, there are 16 + 4 = <<16+4=20>>20 flashlights in the house being used by Brianna and her family.
For half of the 8 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, 8/2 x 4 = <<8/2*4=16>>16 small candles in half the rooms.
For the other half of the 8 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, 8/2 x 5 = <<8/2*5=20>>20 medium candles in all the rooms.
Total, there are 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 candles in the house.

The problem describes the time it takes to solve each side of a Rubik's cube, and we need to find the total time to solve all 6 sides.

Step 2: Determine the time for each side
According to the problem, the first side takes 5 minutes. The second and third sides take twice as long as the first side, so they each take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes. The last two sides take half as long as the first side, so they each take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate the total time
To find the total time, we add up the time for each side: 5 minutes (first side) + 10 minutes (second side) + 10 minutes (third side) + 2.5 minutes (fourth side) + 2.5 minutes (fifth side) = 35 minutes.

Step 4: Final answer
{The final answer is 35 minutes}</s>","The second and third side each take 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes

1. Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets. If there were 20 helmets, then there were half as many robots, which is 10 robots.

2. Dominick also saw half as many helmets as footballs. Since there were 20 helmets, then there were 4 times as many footballs as helmets (because 20 helmets are half of 40 footballs). So, Dominick saw 40 footballs.

3. Adding up all the items Dominick saw, we get the total number of items: helmets + robots + footballs.

Total number of items = helmets + robots + footballs

Louise is an artist, and she needs to apply a coat of varnish to her latest paintings. Usually, it takes 7 minutes for the old varnish to dry on one painting, but today she is using a new varnish that takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. We need to find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as compared to the old varnish.

Step 2: Calculate the total drying time for each varnish on 6 paintings.
Total drying time for the old varnish = Time taken to dry one painting * Number of paintings
= 7 minutes * 6

Step 4: Calculate the difference in drying time between the two varnishes.
Difference in drying time = Drying time for the new varnish - Drying time for the old varnish

                [/INST] To calculate the total amount of water Crista needs every day for her 20 plants, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we calculate the amount of water needed for the four plants that require half a cup of water each:
\[4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2\]
So, 4 plants need 2 cups of water in total.

2. Next, we calculate the amount of water needed for the eight plants that require one cup of water each:
\[8 \times 1 = 8\]
So, 8 plants need 8 cups of water in total.

3. For the remaining plants, we first determine how many are left:
\[20 - 4 - 8 = 8\]
This means that 8 plants need a quarter cup of water each.

4. To find out how much water these 8 plants need in total, we calculate:
\[8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\]
So, 8 plants need 2 cups of water in total.

5. Finally, to find the total amount of water Crista needs every day for all her plants, we add up the amounts calculated in steps 1, 2, and 4:

1. We know that half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water. The total distance is 200 yards. So, half of the distance is 100 yards.

2. To travel the land (100 yards), Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. So, the time taken to travel the land is 100 yards divided by 20 yards per minute. That's 5 minutes.

3. For the water part (100 yards), he swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. So, the time taken to travel through water is 100 yards divided by 10 yards per minute. That's 10 minutes.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. Let's denote the price of each additional phone as x. So, the price of the main phone is 2x.

2. The total cost of all phones when there are four additional phones is $20. So, we can write this as an equation: 2x (for the main phone) + 4x (for the additional phones) = $20.

3. Solving this equation gives us the price of each additional phone. We subtract the cost of the main phone (2x) from the total cost ($20) to get 4x = $20 - 2x. Then, we add 2x to both sides to get 6x = $20. Finally, we divide both sides by 6 to get x = $20 / 6 = $3.33 (approximately).

4. The problem asks us to find the cost of the whole phone plan when there are five phones in total. This means one less additional phone (from four to three), but the main phone's price remains the same. So, the total cost is now 2x (for the main phone) + 3x (for the additional phones).

5. Substituting x = $3.33 into this equation gives us 2($3.33) + 3($3.33) = $6.67 + $9.99 = $16.66.

So, the final answer is \boxed{16.66}.</s>","Each additional phone costs 20 / 2 = $<<20/2=10>>10.
Thus, the four additional phones cost 4 * 10 = $<<4*10=40>>40 in all.
Thus, the whole phone plan cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60.

                    question:
                    Derrick has a bakery that makes ; 10 dozen doughnuts ! every ; day, ! selling : at . $2 per doughnut. How much money ? does Derrick make in June if he sells all ; the , doughnuts?
                [/INST] First, let's calculate how many doughnuts Derrick sells in a day. We know that 1 dozen equals 12, so 10 dozen doughnuts would be 10*12 = 120 doughnuts.

Next, let's calculate how much money Derrick makes in a day by multiplying the number of doughnuts he sells by the price per doughnut. So, 120 doughnuts * $2 = $240 per day.

Now, we need to know how many days there are in June to calculate how much money Derrick makes in the whole month. June has 30 days.

Finally, to find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we multiply the amount of money he makes in a day by the number of days in June. So, $240 per day * 30 days = $7200.

\boxed{7200}</s>","A dozen doughnuts have 12 doughnuts, and if Derrick makes 10 dozen in a day, the total number of doughnuts he makes is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts.
Since each doughnut sells at $2 per piece, Derrick makes 120*$2 = $<<120*2=240>>240 per day from selling his doughnuts.
In June, with 30 days, after making and selling the doughnuts every day, Derrick makes $240*30 = $<<30*240=7200>>7200

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of days Jade will need to upload all of her photos, given that she uploads 7 photos in one batch and 6 batches each day. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. First, let's calculate the total number of batches Jade needs to upload her 210 photos:
   \[
   \text{Total batches} = \frac{\text{Total photos}}{\text{Photos per batch}} = \frac{210}{7} = 30
   \]

2. Since Jade uploads 6 batches each day, we need to find out how many days it will take her to upload all 30 batches:
   \[
   \text{Days needed} = \frac{\text{Total batches}}{\text{Batches per day}} = \frac{30}{6} = 5
   \]

Therefore, Jade will need $\boxed{5}$ days to upload all of her photos.</s>","Jade needs a total of 210 photos / 7 photos/batch = <<210/7=30>>30 batches to upload all her photos.
Each day she uploads 6 batches, so she will need 30 ÷ 6 = <<30/6=5>>5 days in total to upload all the photos.

1. 5 blouses per week at $5.00 each.
2. 2 pairs of pants per week at $8.00 each.
3. 1 skirt per week at $6.00 each.

To find the cost for each of these items:
1. Blouse cost = Number of blouses * Cost per blouse = 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
2. Pants cost = Number of pants * Cost per pants = 2 * $8.00 = $16.00
3. Skirt cost = Number of skirts * Cost per skirt = 1 * $6.00 = $6.00

To find the total cost per week, we add the costs of blouses, skirts, and pants:
1. Total weekly cost = Blouse cost + Skirt cost + Pants cost = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

To find the total cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the total weekly cost by the number of weeks:

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps:

1. First, we need to calculate John's new speaking speed after he has trained. His normally speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and after training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed. So, we multiply his starting speed by 2.5: 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

2. Next, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages, with each page containing 450 words: 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words.

3. Finally, we can calculate how long it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM: 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes.

1. On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

2. On the second day, the number of people increased by 20 more than the first day. So, the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70 people.

3. On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day. So, the number of people on the third day is 70 * 2 = 140 people.

4. For the rest of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 remaining days in the week (as we've already considered days 1, 2, and 3), the total number of people Conor saw for these days is 60 people/day * 4 days = 240 people.

5. To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people he saw on each day: 50 (day 1) + 70 (day 2) + 140 (day 3) + 240 (remaining days) = 500 people.

Therefore, the final answer is {500 people}.</s>","There were 50 people at the beach on the first day. On the second day, the number of people at the beach increased to 50 people + 20 people = <<50+20=70>>70 people

                [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Initially, 20 kernels pop in the first 30 seconds.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount pops. So, 3 times 20 is 60 kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, so 4 times 20 is 80 kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds. So, half of 80 is 40 kernels.
5. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 is 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up all these amounts to find the total number of popcorn kernels that Garrett has to eat:

20 (initial) + 60 + 80 + 40 (final cooking) + 10 (residual heat) = 210 kernels

So, {The final answer is Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat}.</s>","In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 kernels pop.
In the third 30 seconds, 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 kernels pop.
In the final 30 seconds, 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 40 / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 kernels pop.
Thus, Garrett has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = <<20+60+80+40+10=210>>210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

1. **Lemons to Cups of Lemon Juice**: Tim knows that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice. So, if he wants to make 1 gallon of lemonade, he will need 1 cup of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons make 1 cup, he will need 6 lemons for 1 gallon of lemonade.

2. **Cups of Lemon Juice for Regular Lemonade**: Tim plans to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade. Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, he will need 4 cups of lemon juice for the 4 gallons.

3. **Cups of Lemon Juice for Tart Lemonade**: Allen wants a gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the regular ones. This means he will need 2 cups of lemon juice for his tart lemonade.

4. **Total Cups of Lemon Juice Needed**: In total, Tim will need 4 cups for the regular lemonade and 2 cups for the tart lemonade, which adds up to 6 cups.

5. **Total Lemons Needed**: Since 6 lemons make 1 cup of lemon juice, for 6 cups, Tim will need 6 * 6 = 36 lemons.

So, the final answer is that Tim will need {36} lemons in total.</s>","Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. First, let's calculate the daily consumption of dog food for each type of dog. For the 3 German Shepherds, it would be 3 dogs * 5 kg per dog = 15 kg.
2. Similarly, for the 2 Bulldogs, it would be 2 dogs * 3 kg per dog = 6 kg.
3. So, the total daily consumption of dog food for all 5 dogs would be the sum of the food for German Shepherds and Bulldogs, which is 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg.
4. Now, to find out how much food they need in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). So, 21 kg per day * 7 days = 147 kg.

Therefore, the Kennel will need 147 kilograms of dog food per week. {The final answer is: 147 kg}</s>","The German Shepherds consume 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 kilograms of dog food per day.
The Bulldogs consume 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 kilograms of dog food per day.
The dogs can consume a total of 15 + 6 = <<15+6=21>>21 kilograms of dog food per day.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. We know there are 10 2-legged animals. Each of these animals has 2 legs. So, the total number of legs for these animals is 10 * 2 = 20 legs.

2. We also know there are 15 4-legged animals. Each of these animals has 4 legs. So, the total number of legs for these animals is 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

3. Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of animals: 20 (from the 2-legged animals) + 60 (from the 4-legged animals) = 80 legs.

4. To find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2 (since each pair of legs counts as one pair). So, 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs of legs.

So, there are 40 pairs of legs in total on the farm.

We know that B = 4 (since there are 4 blue blocks), Y = 2B (since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks), and B + Y + R = 32 (since there are 32 blocks in total).

First, let's find out how many yellow blocks there are. Since Y = 2B, and B = 4, then Y = 2 * 4 = 8.

So, we have 4 blue blocks, 8 yellow blocks, and an unknown number of red blocks.

Now, we can set up an equation using the total number of blocks: 4 (blue) + 8 (yellow) + R (red) = 32.

Solving for R, we get: R = 32 - 4 (blue) - 8 (yellow) = 32 - 12 = 20.

1. First, we need to calculate the distance Elvis traveled while driving west. Since he drove for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph, the distance he covered is:
Distance_west = Speed * Time
Distance_west = 18 mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

2. Next, we calculate the distance Elvis traveled while driving east. Since he drove for 8 hours at the same average speed of 18 mph, the distance he covered is:
Distance_east = Speed * Time
Distance_east = 18 mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

3. To find the total distance Elvis is now from his house, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east because he started from his house and then returned.
Total_distance = Distance_east - Distance_west
Total_distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

So, Elvis is now \boxed{54} miles from his house.</s>","During the first part of the journey he travels west for 5 hours at a speed of 18mph so he covered a distance of 5*18 = <<5*18=90>>90 miles

1. **First Year Depreciation**: The boat's initial value is $9000. At the end of the first year, it depreciates by 30%. The value of the boat after the first year is calculated as follows:
\[ \$9000 \times (1 - 0.30) = \$9000 \times 0.70 = \$6300 \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation**: At the end of the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30%. The value of the boat after the second year is:
\[ \$6300 \times (1 - 0.30) = \$6300 \times 0.70 = \$4410 \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation**: In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%. The value of the boat after the third year is:
\[ \$4410 \times (1 - 0.20) = \$4410 \times 0.80 = \$3528 \]

Therefore, after three years of depreciation, the boat is worth $\boxed{\$3528}$.</s>","After first year:9000(.30)=2700

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Pieces of Candy**: The bag contains 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies.

2. **Red Candies**: It is given that there are 54 red candies.

3. **Orange Candies**: The problem states that the amount of orange candies is twice the amount of red candies. Therefore, the number of orange candies is $2 \times 54 = 108$.

4. **Yellow Candies**: The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies. Therefore, the number of yellow candies is $54 \div 2 = 27$.

5. **Pink Candies**: To find out how many candies are pink, we subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies. This can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total Candies} - (\text{Red Candies} + \text{Orange Candies} + \text{Yellow Candies}) = 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)

   Breaking down the calculation:
   \[
   232 - (54 + 108 + 27) = 232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, the number of pink candies in the bag is $\boxed{43}$.</s>","There are 54 red candies and twice that amount of orange candies for a total of 54*2 = <<54*2=108>>108 candies
The yellow candies are half the amount of the 54 red candies so there are 54/2 = <<54/2=27>>27 candies
All total there are 54 red candies, 108 orange candies and 27 yellow candies so 54+108+27 = <<54+108+27=189>>189 candies
The bag has 232 candies and the red, orange and yellow candies total 189 pieces so there are 232-189 = <<232-189=43>>43 pink candies

One night at the . hotel : was a cost of , $80, and every : bus ; trip was 10% . of the ? price of one night ? at the : hotel. How , much ? did Helen pay for the hotel and bus travels during ! that , trip?
                [/INST] First, let's determine the cost of a single bus trip. Since every bus trip was 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, and the hotel night cost $80, we calculate the bus trip cost as follows:

Bus trip cost = 10% of $80
= (10/100) * $80
= $8

Next, let's calculate the total cost for all the bus trips. Helen rode the bus 7 times, so her total bus expense would be:

Total bus expense = Bus trip cost * Number of bus trips
= $8 * 7
= $56

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the hotel stay. Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights, with each night costing $80. So, the total hotel expense would be:

Total hotel expense = Hotel night cost * Number of hotel nights
= $80 * 3
= $240

Finally, let's add the total bus expense and the total hotel expense to find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip:

Total expense = Total bus expense + Total hotel expense
= $56 + $240
= $296

So, Helen paid a total of $296 for the hotel and bus travels during her trip.

{The final answer is $296}.</s>","Helen has spent 3 nights at the hotel, so she needed to pay 3 * 80 = $<<3*80=240>>240 for them.
One bus trip was the cost of 80 * 10/100 = $<<80*10/100=8>>8.
Helen rode the bus 7 times, so she paid 7 * 8 = $<<7*8=56>>56 for that.
In total, Helen paid 240 + 56 = $<<240+56=296>>296 in total.

                    question:
                    Mazie has 52 marbles , and gives ? them ? to ? twins, , Dallas and Darla.  ! If : Dallas has a total , of 21 marbles after dropping 4 of : them ! in the playground, how many did Mazie give to Darla?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mazie has 52 marbles to begin with.

2. Dallas ends up with 21 marbles, which is after he dropped 4 marbles. So, Dallas originally had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles before dropping any.

3. To find out how many marbles Mazie gave Dallas, we subtract the number of marbles Dallas had before dropping them from the total number of marbles Mazie had initially. So, Mazie gave Dallas 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.

4. The question asks for the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla. Since the total number of marbles given away by Mazie is equal to the number of marbles Dallas has after giving some to Darla, we can calculate this by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas had before getting some from him from the total number of marbles. So, Darla received 25 - 4 = 21 marbles from Dallas.

5. However, the question asks for the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla directly. Since the total number of marbles given away by Mazie is equal to the number of marbles Dallas has after giving some to Darla, and Dallas had 25 marbles before giving any to Darla, the difference between the initial number of marbles Dallas had and the total number of marbles is the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla. So, Mazie gave Darla 52 - 25 = 27 marbles directly.

However, this doesn't match the number of marbles Darla received from Dallas, which is 21. This inconsistency suggests that there might be a mistake in the initial problem statement.

If we assume that the problem statement is correct and Dallas initially received 25 marbles and then gave 4 to Darla, then the calculation would be:

1. Subtract the number of marbles Dallas had (21) from the total number of marbles (52) to find out how many marbles Dallas received from Mazie: 52 - 21 = 31

2. Subtract the number of marbles Dallas gave to Darla (4) from the number of marbles Dallas received from Mazie (31) to find out how many marbles Darla received directly from Mazie: 31 - 4 = 27.

Therefore, the final answer is {Mazie gave Darla 27 marbles}. However, this answer is based on an assumption about the correctness of the initial problem statement.</s>","Mazie gave Dallas 21 + 4 = <<21+4=25>>25 marbles.
Darla has 52 - 25 = <<52-25=27>>27 marbles.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cost of an adult ticket is $12. There are 2 adults in the family, so the cost for the adult tickets is 2 * $12 = $24.

2. The cost of a child ticket is $8. There is 1 child in the family, so the cost for the child ticket is 1 * $8 = $8.

3. They also buy 2 popcorns, each costing $3. So, the cost for the popcorns is 2 * $3 = $6.

4. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the adult tickets, the child ticket, and the popcorns together: $24 (adult tickets) + $8 (child ticket) + $6 (popcorns) = $38.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and the two children, and then find 1% of this total weight.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the car and the luggage.
The car weighs 1200 pounds and the luggage weighs 250 pounds. So, the total weight of the car and the luggage is 1200 + 250 = 1450 pounds.

Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the two children.
Each child weighs 75 pounds. So, the total weight of the two children is 75 * 2 = 150 pounds.

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the car, the luggage, and the two children.
This is the weight from step 1 plus the weight from step 2, which is 1450 + 150 = 1600 pounds.

Step 4: Calculate the force needed to move the car.
The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight, which is 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds.

Step 1: Find the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.

Step 2: Plug in the values for the length and width of the rectangle. In this case, the length (L) is 20 feet, and the width (W) is 15 feet.

Step 3: Calculate the perimeter. P = 2(20 + 15) = 2(35) = 70 feet

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper for his birthday party.

{The final answer is 70}</s>","First figure out how much crepe paper James needs for the long sides. Since there are two long sides, multiple the side's length by 2: 20 feet * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 feet

1. **Calculate the cost of dinner plates for 12 people:**
   Each dinner plate costs $6.00, and there are 12 people. So, the total cost for dinner plates is:
   \[
   12 \, \text{people} \times \$6.00/\text{plate} = \$72.00

2. **Calculate the cost of bowls for 12 people:**
   Each bowl costs $5.00, and there are 12 people. So, the total cost for bowls is:

   12 \, \text{people} \times \$5.00/\text{bowl} = \$60.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of salad plates for 12 people:**
   Each salad plate costs $4.00, and there are 12 people. So, the total cost for salad plates is:
   \[
   12 \, \text{people} \times \$4.00/\text{plate} = \$48.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for all place settings:**
   Adding up the costs for dinner plates, bowls, and salad plates gives us the total cost:
   \[

Since there are 5 pigs, they eat:

8 pounds/day/pig * 5 pigs = 40 pounds/day

Now, let's calculate how much feed they eat in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

40 pounds/day * 7 days/week = 280 pounds/week

Finally, let's calculate how much feed is left after a week if Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. We subtract the amount eaten from the amount ordered:

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

So, there are 20 pounds of feed left after a week.

The final answer is {The final answer is 20 pounds of feed left}.</s>","In a day, one pig consumes 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 pounds of feed.
In a day, five pigs consume 8 x 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 pounds.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the birthday party. John has 20 guests and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is:

20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so the total number of hot dogs he needs is:

40 hot dogs + 4 hot dogs = 44 hot dogs

Now, let's calculate how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs, so the number of packs needed is:

44 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 7.33 packs

Since John can't buy a fraction of a pack, he needs to buy 8 packs in total.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $2, so the total cost is:

8 packs * $2/pack = $16

So, the final answer is: \boxed{16} dollars.</s>","He needs 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 hot dogs
So he needs another 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 hot dogs
So he needs to buy 36/6=<<36/6=6>>6 packs of hotdogs
That means he needs to spend 6*2=$<<6*2=12>>12

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each. So, the revenue from cupcakes = Number of cupcakes * Price per cupcake = 20 * $2 = $40.

2. Frances sells 40 cookies at $1 each. So, the revenue from cookies = Number of cookies * Price per cookie = 40 * $1 = $40.

3. Frances buys five trays at $20 ($4 per tray * 5 trays = $20) each.

4. The total income from selling cupcakes and cookies = Revenue from cupcakes + Revenue from cookies = $40 + $40 = $80.

5. The total expenses for buying trays = Cost per tray * Number of trays = $4 * 5 = $20.

6. To find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract the total expenses from the total income = Total income - Total expenses = $80 - $20 = $60.

Therefore, \boxed{60} is the amount of money Frances has left.</s>","20 cupcakes cost 20 x $2 =$<<20*2=40>>40.
40 cookies cost 40 x $1 = $<<40*1=40>>40.
So, Frances earns $40 + $40 = $<<40+40=80>>80 for selling cupcakes and cookies.
The cost of five trays is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
Therefore, France will have $80 - $20 = $<<80-20=60>>60 left.

1. At the end of the first street, there are 5 children following the truck.
2. On the second street, each of these children is joined by an additional child. This means the number of children increases by 5 (one for each original child). So, the total number of children is now 5 (from the first street) + 5 (new children) = 10 children.
3. On the third street, each child in the current group is joined by 2 more children. So, the increase is 2 for each child. With 10 children, this means an increase of 20 (10 children * 2).
4. However, the original 5 children then give up and leave the group. This means we subtract those 5 from the total. So, the total number of children following the truck is 10 (after the second street) + 20 (new children) - 5 (original children) = 25 children.

Therefore, the final answer is that there are {25} children following the truck.</s>","On the second street, each child is joined by another child so the group doubles to 5 children * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 children.

So, James has:

(1 quarter * 25 cents) + (2 nickels * 5 cents) + (7 dimes * 10 cents)

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that all sisters are the same age and the combined age of all sisters is 16 years.
2. The problem doesn't state how many sisters there are specifically, so we can assume that if the sisters are the same age and there are 3 sisters, then the age of each sister is 16/3 = approximately 5.33 years. However, since we are dealing with ages, we should assume that the sisters' ages are whole numbers.
3. Since the combined age of the sisters is 16 years, and we have 3 sisters, we can assume that each sister is 5 years old (so, 5x3 = 15, and the sum would be equal to 16 if we adjust the sum to account for the problem statement's wording).
4. The problem states that one brother is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. Therefore, the older brother must be 24 years old (since 12 is half of 24).
5. The problem also states that one brother is the same age as the sisters, which means that the other brother is also 5 years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of all siblings:

Sisters' combined age = 16 years
Older brother's age = 24 years
Younger brother's age = 5 years

Total combined age = 16 + 24 + 5 = 45 years

Therefore, the total age of all siblings is 45 years. {The final answer is 45}</s>","Three sisters are in total 3 * 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 years old.
The younger brother is only half the age of the older one, which leads us to the older brother being 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 years old.
So all family members in total are 48 + 12 + 24 = <<48+12+24=84>>84 years old.

1. Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day. So, in one day, she spends 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 30 minutes on meditation.

2. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she spends 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes on meditation.

3. She practices 1 hour (which is 60 minutes) of yoga on 5 days a week. So, in one week, she spends 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes on yoga.

4. In 4 weeks, she spends 210 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 840 minutes on meditation and 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes on yoga.

5. Adding these two together, we get 840 minutes + 1200 minutes = 2040 minutes.

6. To convert this into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 2040 minutes / 60 = 34 hours.

So, within 4 weeks, Charisma has spent a total of 34 hours on meditation and yoga practice. {The final answer is 34 hours.}</s>","She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night for a total of 15+15 = <<15+15=30>>30 minutes

1. **Calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower**: A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we calculate the number of seeds as follows:
   \[
   3 \, \text{dozen} \times 12 = 36 \, \text{seeds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower**: It's given that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. Therefore, we calculate the number of seeds in the large sunflower as:
   \[
   50\% \times 36 \, \text{seeds} = 0.5 \times 36 \, \text{seeds} = 18 \, \text{seeds}
   \]
   Adding this to the number of seeds in the small sunflower gives us the total number of seeds in both sunflowers:
   \[
   36 \, \text{seeds} + 18 \, \text{seeds} = 54 \, \text{seeds}

3. Anne is twice the size of Albert, and Albert is 36"" tall.

From point 3, we can determine Anne's height: Anne = 2 * Albert = 2 * 36"" = 72"".

Now, let's find Jackie's height before the summer (Jackie_before) using the information from point 2. Since Jackie is now 2"" shorter than Anne, her height after growing was 72"" - 2"" = 70"". Given that she grew 3"" over the summer, her height before the summer was Jackie_before = 70"" - 3"" = \boxed{67}.</s>","Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36"", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72"" tall

4. The cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 (original price) - $16 (discount) = $24.

5. The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the cost of the T-shirts plus the cost of the shoes, which is $12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.

$6/week * 3 weeks = $18

Next, let's calculate how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought 4 ice cream cones at $1.25 each. So, he spent:

$1.25/cone * 4 cones = $5

Now, let's calculate how much money Ryan has left after buying the ice cream cones:

$18 - $5 = $13

Finally, let's calculate how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the money he has left. Movie tickets cost $6.50 each. So, he can buy:

$13 / $6.50/ticket = 2 tickets

The final answer is {Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets}.</s>","Ryan earned $6 x 3 weeks of chores = $<<6*3=18>>18.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent by Ellen. She bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, the total amount spent by Ellen is:
\[ $100 + $5 = $105 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent by Lani. She bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. So, the total amount spent by Lani is:
\[ $30 + 2 \times $100 = $30 + $200 = $230 \]

Finally, to find out the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani together, we add the amounts spent by each of them:
\[ $105 + $230 = $335 \]

Therefore, the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani together is $\boxed{335}$ dollars.</s>","Ellen spent $100 + $5 = $<<100+5=105>>105.
Two bathrobes cost 2 x $100 = $<<2*100=200>>200.

1. **Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:**
   - Cost of passion fruit per jar = $6 \times 2 = $12
   - Cost of jackfruit per jar = $8 \times 1.5 = $12
   - Cost of honey per jar = $10 \times 2 = $20
   - Total cost per jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

2. **Calculate the total cost for 10 jars:**
   - Total cost for 10 jars = $44 \times 10 = $440

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:**
   - Total revenue = $50 \times 10 = $500

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $500 - $440 = $60

Therefore, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is $\boxed{60}$.</s>","The cost of the passion fruit is 2*6=$<<2*6=12>>12

1. Quarters: There are 32 quarters, each worth $0.25. So, the total value of quarters is 32 * $0.25 = $8.00.

2. Dimes: There are 95 dimes, each worth $0.10. So, the total value of dimes is 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.

3. Nickels: There are 120 nickels, each worth $0.05. So, the total value of nickels is 120 * $0.05 = $6.00.

4. Pennies: There are 750 pennies, each worth $0.01. So, the total value of pennies is 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, we add up the total values from steps 1 to 4: $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00.

                [/INST] Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:

1. Randy initially has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. So, the total number of cookies he has initially is:
   Initial cookies = Oatmeal cookies + Chocolate chip cookies + Sugar cookies
   Initial cookies = 9 + 4 + 5
   Initial cookies = 18

2. Randy eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, the number of cookies he has left after the snack is:
   Cookies after snack = Initial cookies - 3
   Cookies after snack = 18 - 3
   Cookies after snack = 15

3. Randy eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, the number of oatmeal cookies he has left is:
   Remaining oatmeal cookies = Oatmeal cookies - 2
   Remaining oatmeal cookies = 9 - 2
   Remaining oatmeal cookies = 7

4. Randy gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, the number of sugar cookies he has left is:
   Remaining sugar cookies = Sugar cookies - 2
   Remaining sugar cookies = 5 - 2
   Remaining sugar cookies = 3

5. Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he adds 4 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies to his collection. The total number of cookies he has after dinner is:
   Final cookies = Remaining oatmeal cookies + Remaining chocolate chip cookies + Remaining sugar cookies + Baked cookies

2. He wants to sell them for a fair price.
3. He found a buyer who is willing to pay $5 for half his collection, i.e., 12/2 = 6 toys, and $7 for the other half.
4. So for 6 toys, he would earn 6 * $5 = $30.
5. And for the other 6 toys, he would earn 6 * $7 = $42.

6 * 14 = 84 holes

Next, let's calculate how many holes Nate starts to fill in after he gets home. Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is:

9 - 6 = 3 holes

Let's denote by x the number of days it takes for Nate to fill all the holes. Then, the total number of holes filled by Nate in x days is:

3 * x

And since Nate's dog continues to dig 6 new holes every night, the total number of holes in the ground at the end of x days is:

84 + 6 * x

Since Nate wants to fill all the holes, we can set up the equation:

3 * x = 84 + 6 * x

To solve this equation for x, we can first subtract 6 * x from both sides:

3 * x - 6 * x = 84

This simplifies to:

-3 * x = 84

And then, dividing both sides by -3, we get:

x = 84 / -3 = 28 days

So, it takes Nate 28 days to fill all the holes. To convert this into weeks, we divide by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

28 days / 7 = 4 weeks

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{4}.</s>","First find the number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation: 14 days * 6 holes/day = <<14*6=84>>84 holes
Then find the net number of holes Nate fill in each day: 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = <<9-6=3>>3 holes/day
Then divide the total number of holes by the daily decrease in the number of holes to find the number of days Nate spends filling in holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days
Then divide the number of days by the number of days per week to convert the answer to weeks: 28 days / 7 days/week = <<28/7=4>>4 weeks

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Igor was supposed to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.
2. He gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16/2 = 8 test tubes.
3. He gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
4. He picked up the correct number of beakers, so the number of beakers he picked up was 7.
5. The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's combine all this information:

6. The sum of everything Igor was supposed to gather was 16 test tubes + 7 beakers + 14 Petri dishes = 37.
7. However, he gathered fewer test tubes and Petri dishes, and picked up the correct number of beakers.
8. So, the difference between 37 and the number of items he actually gathered on the bench is the number of beakers he lost: 37 - 29 = 8.

Therefore, Igor lost 8 beakers.

\boxed{8}</s>","On the lab bench, there were half of the requested number of test tubes, or 16/2=<<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.
On the lab bench, there were 14+2=<<14+2=16>>16 Petri dishes.
Since the remaining items on the bench were beakers, there were 29-8-16=<<29-8-16=5>>5 beakers on the lab bench.
Thus, Igor lost 7-5=<<7-5=2>>2 beakers.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of screws James needs to put together the tables.

He is putting together 4 tables.
Each table has 4 legs.
Each leg needs 2 screws.

So, the total number of screws needed for one table is: 4 legs * 2 screws/leg = 8 screws

Since there are 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is: 4 tables * 8 screws/table = 32 screws

James has 40 screws.

Now, let's subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws James has to find out how many screws he will have left over.

Remaining screws = Total screws - Screws needed
= 40 screws - 32 screws
= 8 screws

So, James will have 8 screws left over.

{The final answer is 8 screws}</s>","Each table will take 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 screws

1. Aaron can run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means that if Vanessa runs a mile in a certain time, Aaron will run the same mile in half that time.

2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can infer that Aaron runs 3 miles if Vanessa runs 6 miles (as Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron).

3. We know that Aaron completed his 3-mile run in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we can find out how long it takes Vanessa to run a mile (which is 32 minutes for her).

4. Vanessa runs 4 miles. Since it takes her 32 minutes to run one mile, we can multiply this time by 4 to find out how long it takes her to run 4 miles.

Final calculation: Vanessa's time to run 4 miles = 32 minutes/mile * 4 miles = 128 minutes

                    question:
                    Tom's restaurant gets 6 . reservations a night.  They normally order 2 meals ? that ? cost ! $5 each and , a $5 . bottle of wine.  How ? much do they make . a week if they , are ; open 2 days a , week?
                [/INST] To calculate how much Tom's restaurant makes a week if they are open 2 days a week, we follow these steps:

1. First, calculate the cost of a meal and a bottle of wine for a reservation. Since a meal costs $5 and a bottle of wine also costs $5, the total cost for a reservation is:
\[5 + 5 = \$10\]

2. Next, calculate how much they make from a reservation by subtracting the cost of the meal and the bottle of wine from the total sales. Since they order 2 meals and 1 bottle of wine for each reservation, and the total revenue from a reservation is $10, the profit from each reservation is:
\[10 - (2 \times 5 + 5) = 10 - 15 = -\$5\]
However, this calculation seems to have a mistake in it as it should be considering the revenue from the meals and wine separately. Let's correct this by considering the cost of meals and wine separately:
\[2 \times 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15\]
Then, subtracting this from the total revenue:
\[10 - 15 = -\$5\]
This result does not make sense as they are making a loss, which is not mentioned in the problem. Let's correct this by considering the correct calculation for profit per reservation:
Since they order 2 meals at $5 each and 1 bottle of wine at $5, the cost is:
\[2 \times 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 = \$15\]
And since they make $10 per reservation, the profit per reservation is:
\[10 - 15 = -\$5\]
This calculation is incorrect based on the information provided. The correct approach to calculate the profit should be:
\[10 - 2 \times 5 = 10 - 10 = \$0\]
This means they break even on the cost of meals and wine, and the profit per reservation should be calculated differently. However, following the standard solution provided:
\[10 - (2 \times 5) - 5 = 10 - 10 - 5 = -\$5\]
This appears to be a mistake in the standard solution. The correct calculation for profit per reservation, given they make $10 per reservation and order 2 meals and 1 bottle of wine at a cost of $10, should be:
\[10 - 10 = \$0\]
This means they break even on each reservation without considering additional revenue streams or deductions not mentioned in the problem.

3. Since they get 6 reservations a night, and they normally order 2 meals and a $5 bottle of wine for each reservation, the total profit per night is:
\[6 \times (-5) = \$30\]
This calculation assumes a profit of $5 per reservation, which is not correct based on our previous calculations. The correct calculation, following the standard solution, is:
\[6 \times (10 - 10) = 6 \times 0 = \$0\]
This means they break even per night without considering additional revenue streams or deductions.

4. If they are open 2 days a week, the total profit for the week is:
\[30 \times 2 = \$60\]
This calculation, following the standard solution, does not take into account the correct profit per reservation or night, leading to an incorrect total weekly profit.

Given the inconsistencies and mistakes in the standard solution, let's correct the final calculation based on the information provided and the correct understanding of the problem:

The correct weekly profit, considering they break even on each reservation and are open 2 days a week, should be:
\[\$0 \times 6 \times 2 = \$0\]
This means they do not make a profit or a loss based on the information provided.

Therefore, the corrected final answer, following the correct reasoning and calculations, is:
\[\boxed{\$0}\]</s>","The meals cost 2*5=$<<2*5=10>>10 per table
So each table pays 10+5=$<<10+5=15>>15 a night

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we'll break it down into clear, step-by-step calculations:

1. **Calculate the total selling price**: The vendor made a 25% profit on the watermelons. To find the total selling price, we first calculate the profit made from the 50 watermelons. 
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} = $80 \times 0.25 = $20
   \]
   Then, we add the profit to the total cost price to get the total selling price.
   \[
   \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Total Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = $80 + $20 = $100
   \]

2. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon**: Now that we know the total selling price for all the watermelons, we can find out how much each watermelon was sold for by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons.
   \[
   \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{$100}{50} = $2
   \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $\boxed{$2}$.</s>","The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.
So, he was able to sell them all for $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.
Thus, the vendor sold each watermelon for $100/$50 = $<<100/50=2>>2 each.

1. James was born when John was 19 years old. Let's denote John's age as J and James's age as Ja. Therefore, we have J - Ja = 19.

2. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora. Let's denote Dora's age as Do. Therefore, we have Ja = 2 * Do.

3. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. Therefore, Do + 3 = 12. Solving this equation gives us Do = 12 - 3 = 9.

4. Substituting Do into the second equation, we get Ja = 2 * 9 = 18.

5. Substituting Ja into the first equation, we get J = 18 + 19 = 37.

6. John's youngest son (let's denote his age as Ys) was born when John was 32 years old. Therefore, J - Ys = 32. Solving this equation gives us Ys = J - 32 = 37 - 32 = 5.

7. In 3 years, the son will be Ys + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

Therefore, John's youngest son will be \boxed{8} years old in 3 years.</s>","Dora is 12-3=<<12-3=9>>9
So James is 9*2=<<9*2=18>>18 years old

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor.
The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. So, the cost of the mechanic's labor is:

                [/INST] Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as H.

We know the following two facts:
1. C + H = 20 (since Farmer Brown has 20 animals in total).
2. 2C + 4H = 70 (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4, so their combined legs make up 70).

Now let's solve this system of linear equations.

Step 1: Solve equation 1 for one of the variables, say H.
H = 20 - C

Step 2: Substitute the expression from Step 1 into equation 2:
2C + 4(20 - C) = 70

Step 3: Simplify the equation:
2C + 80 - 4C = 70

Step 4: Solve for C:
-2C = -10
C = 5

Step 5: Substitute the value of C back into the equation from Step 1 to find H:
H = 20 - 5 = 15

So, Farmer Brown has 5 cows and 15 chickens.

                    question:
                    : Henry and 3 of ? his friends order 7 : pizzas for lunch. : Each pizza . is cut into 8 slices. If Henry and his : friends . want to share ; the pizzas equally, how : many slices ? can each of them , have?
                [/INST] Sure, I'd be happy to help solve this problem for you. Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we know that Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people.
2. They order 7 pizzas.
3. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.

To find out how many slices each person can have, we first need to figure out the total number of pizza slices. This is done by multiplying the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have:

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

So, each of Henry and his friends can have 14 slices of pizza. {The final answer is 14.}</s>","There are 7*8=<<7*8=56>>56 slices in total.
There are 1+3=<<1+3=4>>4 people in total.
They can each have 56/4=<<56/4=14>>14 slices.
