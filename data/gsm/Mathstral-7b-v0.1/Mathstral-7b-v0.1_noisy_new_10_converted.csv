                    question:
                    Janet’s ducks ; lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes ? muffins for her friends every day with four. ? She sells ! the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day ? at the farmers' market?
                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast every morning.
She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning, so:
Eggs eaten for breakfast = 3 eggs

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs Janet uses for baking every day.
For baking, she uses 4 eggs per muffin, and we don't know how many muffins she makes, so let's denote the number of muffins she makes as 'm'.
Eggs used for baking = 4eggs/muffin * m muffins

Step 3: Calculate the number of eggs Janet has left for selling.
Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. After eating and baking, she sells the remainder at the farmers' market:
Remaining eggs = Total eggs - Eggs eaten for breakfast - Eggs used for baking
Remaining eggs = 16eggs/day - 3eggs - 4eggs/muffin * m muffins

Step 4: Calculate the money Janet makes by selling the remaining eggs at the farmers' market every day.
She sells every remaining egg for $2. So, the daily income from the farmers' market is:
Income = Remaining eggs * Price per egg
Income = (16eggs/day - 3eggs - 4eggs/muffin * m muffins) * $2

The final answer is the income Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, which is a function of the number of muffins she makes (m). Since we don't know the number of muffins, the final answer is not a numerical value. We can represent it as an expression:

\boxed{(16 - 3 - 4m) * $2}</s>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

                    A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that , much white fiber.  How many bolts ; in total does it take?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. It also requires half the amount of blue fiber in white fiber. Since we know that the blue fiber requirement is 2 bolts, half of that would be 1 bolt.
3. To find the total number of bolts needed, we simply add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber together.

So, 2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts

Therefore, {The final answer is 3 bolts}.</s>","It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric

                    question:
                    Josh decides to try flipping a ; house.  ! He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in ; $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out Josh's total investment in the house. This includes the purchase price ($80,000) and the cost of repairs ($50,000). If we add these two together, we get $130,000.

2. Next, we need to understand that the value of the house increased by 150%. This means that the original value of the house was increased by a total that is 150% of its original value. In other words, the original value of the house was multiplied by (1 + 1.5) = 2.5.

3. However, we need to subtract the original value of the house from the final value because the increase in value is given in terms of the original value, not the increased value.

4. So, if the original value of the house was $X, the final value would be 2.5X. But we know that the original value was X dollars less than the final value, so X = Final Value - Original Value = 2.5X - X.

5. Solving for X, we get X = 1.5X. Dividing both sides by 1.5 (since X cannot be zero), we get X = 60,000.

6. Now, we need to find out the profit Josh made. This is the final value of the house minus Josh's total investment. The final value of the house is 2.5X (from step 5) which is 2.5 * 60,000 = 150,000. So, the profit is 150,000 - 130,000 = 20,000.

So, the final answer is:

{The final answer is, Josh made a profit of $20,000.}</s>","The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000

                    James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.  He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters ; does he run , a week?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to find out how many meters James runs in a week. We know that he runs 60 meters each sprint and he does 3 sprints 3 times a week.

First, let's calculate how many meters he runs in one set of 3 sprints.

Meters in 1 set of 3 sprints = Meters per sprint * Number of sprints
= 60 meters * 3
= 180 meters

Now, since he does this 3 times a week, we can find out how many meters he runs in a week by multiplying the meters in one set of 3 sprints by the number of times he does it in a week.

Meters per week = Meters in 1 set of 3 sprints * Number of times per week
= 180 meters * 3
= 540 meters

So, the total meters James runs in a week is \boxed{540}.</s>","He sprints 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 times

How many cups of feed does she need to ; give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock ! is 20 chickens?
                [/INST] First, let's understand the problem:
Wendi feeds her chickens three times a day, each time giving them three meals. In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. We need to find out how many cups of feed she needs to give in the final meal of the day.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the first two meals:
Morning feed = 15 cups
Afternoon feed = 25 cups
Total feed in the first two meals = Morning feed + Afternoon feed = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Now, since Wendi gives three meals a day, the total amount of feed given in a day is three times the amount given in the first meal:
Total feed in a day = 3 * Total feed in the first meal = 3 * 40 cups = 120 cups

Finally, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give in the final meal of the day, subtract the total amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed given in a day:
Feed in the final meal = Total feed in a day - Total feed in the first two meals = 120 cups - 40 cups = 80 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 80 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

{The final answer is 80 cups}</s>","If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.

                [/INST] Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. Out of these, every second glass costs only 60% of the price of a normal glass.

For the first 8 glasses, the cost will be calculated as normal price, which is $5 each.
For the second 8 glasses (every second glass), the cost will be calculated as 60% of $5.

So, the cost for the first 8 glasses is 8 * $5 = $40.
The cost for the second 8 glasses is 8 * ($5 * 0.6) = $24.

Therefore, the total cost for all 16 glasses is $40 + $24 = $64.

{The final answer is $64}</s>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep. This is given in the question.

2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

4. Now, to find out how many sheep they have together, we simply add up the number of sheep each city has: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260 sheep.

So, the final answer to the question is {the three cities have a total of 260 sheep}.</s>","If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep

To download a 200 GB file at a speed of 2 GB/minute, it would take:
Time = Total size / Speed
Time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to download the file after the restart.
Since Carla has to restart the download from the beginning after the Windows restart, she has to download the entire 200 GB file again. The total time taken for the download after the restart is also 100 minutes.

Step 3: Add the time taken during the Windows restart to the total download time.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the distance John traveled before turning around.
John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. So, the distance he covers is 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.

Step 2: Calculate the distance John traveled after turning around.
First, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.
Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph, covering a distance of 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.
Finally, he drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at a speed of 80 mph, covering a distance of 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.
So, the total distance he covers after turning around is 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

Step 3: Calculate the distance from home at the end of those 4 hours.
Since he has already traveled 180 miles before turning around, and he traveled 135 miles after turning around, the distance from home at the end of those 4 hours is the difference between these two distances, which is 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

So, the final answer is: John is 45 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.</s>","When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home

Overtime pay rate = Regular hourly rate * Overtime rate
Overtime pay rate = $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour

Now, let's calculate her overtime pay for the remaining hours she worked (which is 5 hours).

Overtime earnings = Overtime pay rate * Hours of overtime
Overtime earnings = $12 * 5 = $60

Finally, let's add her earnings for the first 40 hours and her overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week.

                [/INST] To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the annual net profit and find out when it becomes positive.

1. **Calculate the revenue per year**: The tree grows 7 lemons each year, and each lemon is sold for $1.

5. Therefore, the total revenue per year is $7 \times $1.5 = $\boxed{\$10.5}$.

2. **Calculate the cost per year**: It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree.

3. **Calculate the net profit per year**: The net profit per year is the revenue minus the cost. So, the net profit per year is $\$10.5 - $3 = $\boxed{\$7.5}$.

4. **Determine the number of years to start earning**: Carlos spent $90 to plant the tree. Since he starts earning $7.5 per year after the first year, we need to find out how many years it will take for the total earnings to match the cost of planting the tree. This can be calculated using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Net profit per year}} + 1
   \]

5. **Substitute the values into the formula**:

   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} + 1 = 12 + 1 = \boxed{13}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 13 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.</s>","He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5
He earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5
It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13

1. She sold a third at the green house, so she has 2/3V left.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has 2/3V - 2 vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has (1/2)(2/3V - 2) vacuum cleaners left.
4. We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up an equation:

(1/2)(2/3V - 2) = 5

5. Solving this equation for V gives us:

V/3 - 1 = 5
V/3 = 6
V = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the number of students enrolled in each type of dance. 

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

Now, 55% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. The remaining students after contemporary dance is enrolled would be:
20 - 4 = 16 students

So, the number of students enrolled in jazz dance would be:
16 * 0.55 = 8.8 ≈ 9 students (since we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll round this to the nearest whole number)

Now, the rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. After subtracting the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students after contemporary dance, we have:
16 - 9 = 7 students

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, divide the number of hip-hop students by the total number of students in the class and multiply by 100:
(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the final answer is {35% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance}.</s>","There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.
So, 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 students are enrolled in either jazz or hip-hop dance.
There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
This is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.

If the merchant is looking to maximize profit at the end of this month by making a choice, how much profit would this be?
                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the merchant has a choice between two purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000.

2. According to the merchant's financial advisor, the jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%, while the electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2% within the same month.

3. To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the option that will yield the highest return.

4. Let's calculate the potential returns for each option:
   - For the jewelry worth $5,000, a 2.5% increase would result in a profit of $125 ($5,000 x 0.025).
   - For the electronic gadgets worth $8,000, a 1.2% increase would result in a profit of $96 ($8,000 x 0.012).

5. Comparing the profits, it's clear that choosing the electronic gadgets would yield a higher profit of $96 versus the jewelry's profit of $125. However, the question asks for the difference in profit between the two options, not the individual profits.

6. Therefore, the difference in profit between the two options is $96 - $125 = -$29.

However, there's a mistake in the problem statement. The merchant wants to maximize profit, but the calculations based on the given expectations show that the jewelry would yield a higher profit. Therefore, the merchant should choose the jewelry, not the electronic gadgets.

So, the final answer is that the merchant should choose the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125.</s>","If he purchases jewelry, he will make a profit of 2.5% which is $5000*(2.5/100) = $<<5000*(2.5/100)=125>>125

Here's the reasoning:

1. On the first day, both trains travel westward for 80 miles.
2. This means that in two days, they'll have traveled a combined total of 80 miles x 2 trains = 160 miles.
3. On the second day, both trains travel northward for 150 miles each.
4. Adding the distances covered on both days, we get: 160 miles (second day) + 160 miles (first day westward) = 320 miles.
5. Since there are two trains, we divide this total distance by 2 to find the distance covered by each train: 320 miles ÷ 2 = 230 miles.

So, each train covers a distance of 230 miles over the two days.</s>","On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to find out how much time Marissa has spent walking so far. She walked 4 miles in 1 hour and then 2 miles in another hour. So, she has already spent 2 hours walking.

2. The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time. In this case, if Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail, the time it would take her to walk the entire trail at this average speed would be 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

3. However, she has already spent 2 hours, so she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.

4. The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance she has already walked, which is 12 miles - 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) = 6 miles.

5. Therefore, to achieve her desired average speed, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, which means her speed needs to be 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. First, we need to find out how much of the 10 liters of orange drink is water. Since it's two-thirds water, we multiply 10 liters by 2/3 to get 6.67 liters of water.

2. Next, we need to find out how much of the 15 liters of pineapple drink is water. Since it's three-fifths water, we multiply 15 liters by 3/5 to get 9 liters of water.

3. After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, we have 9 liters of orange drink remaining. Since 6.67 liters of that was water, we subtract 1 liter (the amount spilled) and get 8.67 liters of orange drink left, of which 5.67 liters is water (because 8.67 * 2/3 = 5.67).

4. Now, we add the remaining 9 liters of orange drink (which is not all water) to the 15 liters of pineapple drink that was not spilled. This gives us 24 liters of mixed drink.

5. The total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink. That's 5.67 liters from the orange drink and 9 liters from the pineapple drink, for a total of 14.67 liters.

So, the final answer is that there is 14.67 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of mixed drink.</s>","There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.

                [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so let's denote Raymond's birth year as R and Samantha's birth year as S. We know that R = S - 6.

2. Samantha is currently 31 years old, so she was born in the year 2000 if we consider the current year to be 2021 (this is just an assumption to help us with the calculation). So, S = 2000.

3. Using this information, we can find out that Raymond was born in 1994 (R = S - 6 = 2000 - 6 = 1994).

4. Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old, so his son was born in 1994 - 23 = 1971.

5. Now, we want to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since the current year is 2021, we can calculate this by subtracting the son's birth year from the current year: 2021 - 1971 = 50.

Therefore, {The final answer is}, Raymond's son was born 50 years ago.</s>","When Raymond's son was born Samantha was 23 - 6 = <<23-6=17>>17 years old.

                    question:
                    Kyle bought last year's best-selling book ! for $19.50. This is with a ! 25% discount from the original price. What was the original price of the book?
                [/INST] To find the original price of the book, we start with the equation that represents the relationship between the discounted price, the percentage of the discount, and the original price. The equation is:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 - \frac{\text{Discount Rate}}{100}) \]

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 with a $25\%$ discount, we can substitute these values into the equation:

\[ 19.50 = \text{Original Price} \times (1 - \frac{25}{100}) \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 19.50 = \text{Original Price} \times 0.75 \]

To find the original price, we divide both sides of the equation by $0.75$:

\[ \text{Original Price} = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Calculating the division:

\[ \text{Original Price} = 26 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $\boxed{26}$.</s>","Let X be the original price of the book. The discounted price is X - X*25% = $19.50.
Combining like terms, we get .75X = $19.50
Dividing both sides by .75, we get X = $26.

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the cost of the items we know the quantity of.
   - Chicken meal: $12
   - Milk: 5 packs * $3/pack = $15
   - Apples: 4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6

2. Now, let's add up the cost of these items:
   - Total cost = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

3. Marie paid a total of $50. So, the cost of the pizza boxes is:
   - Cost of pizza boxes = Total paid - Total cost of known items = $50 - $33 = $17

4. Each box of pizza costs $8.50. So, the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered is:
   - Number of pizza boxes = Cost of pizza boxes / Cost per pizza box = $17 / $8.50/box = 2 boxes

Therefore, {Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza}.</s>","Five packs of milk cost $3 x 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
Four apples cost $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.5*4=6>>6.
The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $<<12+15+6=33>>33.
Thus, the boxes of pizza cost $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.
Therefore, Marie ordered $17/$8.50 = <<17/8.5=2>>2 boxes of pizza.

1. Henry's total bike trip was 60 miles.
2. He made his first stop after the 20-mile mark.

To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to calculate how many miles there are from the 20-mile mark (first stop) to the 15-mile-to-go mark (second stop).

First, let's determine how many miles are left when there are 15 miles before the end of the trip:
60 miles (total distance) - 15 miles (remaining distance to the end) = 45 miles

Henry's first stop was at the 20-mile mark, so to find the distance between the first and second stops, we subtract the 20 miles of the first leg from the remaining 45 miles:
45 miles (remaining distance after the first stop) - 20 miles (distance to the first stop) = 25 miles

2. The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.
3. Together, the two pairs of heels cost $33 + $66 = $99.
4. We are told that the boots cost $5 more than the total cost of the two pairs of heels. So, the boots cost $99 + $5 = $104.

D/A = 7/11

We are also given that their total age now is 162, so we can write:

D + A = 162

Now, we can use the first equation to express D in terms of A:

D = (7/11)A

Substitute this expression into the second equation:

(7/11)A + A = 162

Combine the terms:

(18/11)A = 162

Now, solve for A:

A = 162 * (11/18)
A = 99

Now that we know Allen's current age is 99, we can calculate his age 10 years from now:

1. First, we calculate the number of points Mike scored in the second 20 minutes. Since he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes, we need to find 25% of 4 points and then add it to the 4 points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

2. To find 25% of 4 points, we calculate $4 \times 0.25 = 1$ point.

3. Then, we add this to his score in the first 20 minutes: $4 + 1 = 5$ points.

4. Now, we need to find the total points he scored in both 20-minute intervals. Since he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes and 5 points in the second 20 minutes, we add these together: $4 + 5 = 9$ points.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller, manageable steps:

1. **Determine the cost of one yogurt**: Since Terry buys 4 yogurts for $5.00, the cost of one yogurt can be calculated by dividing the total price by the number of yogurts. This gives us:
   \[

He had $5 left, so before buying the video games, he had $195 (from selling his Lego sets) + $5 = $200. This means he had $200 - $160 = $40 before buying the video games.
3. Since he only had $40 to spend on video games and spent the whole amount, he must have used the money he had from selling his Lego sets to buy the video games and have none left. Therefore, he still has the same number of Lego sets he started with.

                    . John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs.  ? How fast does he ! run?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.
2. He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs.

First, let's calculate the total hours John runs in a week.

If he runs 3 hours the first day, then he runs half of that, which is 1.5 hours, for the other two days. So, his weekly running time is:

3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours

Now, let's calculate his speed. To do this, we need to know how far he runs in those 6 hours. Since he runs 60 miles in a week, we can calculate his speed as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time

In this case, the distance is 60 miles and the time is 6 hours. So,

Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

{The final answer is 10 miles per hour.}</s>","He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.
He runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.
So for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.
So in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.
So he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.

                    question:
                    Dana can run ? at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 , miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours ; if : she spends one-third of . the time running : and two-thirds of the time walking?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. First, we know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate that is half as fast as she can run. So, the speed at which she can run is twice the speed at which she can skip, which is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

2. Next, we know that she can run four times faster than she can walk. So, the speed at which she can walk is the speed at which she can run divided by four, which is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

3. The problem states that she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking. So, if she is walking for two-thirds of the time, she is running for one-third of the time.

4. Therefore, the time she spends running is (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours, and the time she spends walking is (2/3) * 6 hours = 4 hours.

5. Now, we can calculate how many miles she can run and walk in six hours. The distance is equal to the speed multiplied by the time. So, the distance she can run in 2 hours is 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles, and the distance she can walk in 4 hours is 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

6. The total distance she can travel in six hours is the sum of the distance she can run and the distance she can walk, which is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

Final Answer: Dana can travel \boxed{18} miles in six hours.</s>","If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

                [/INST] The bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, and there are 5 servings in a 300g bag. First, we need to find out how many calories are in a 300g bag.

Calories in 300g bag = Calories per serving * Number of servings
= 250 calories * 5
= 1250 calories

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume to reach your daily calorie target of 2000.

Calories left = Daily calorie target - Calories consumed
= 2000 calories - 1800 calories
= 200 calories

Then, we need to find out how many grams of chips you can eat. Since each gram of chips has 7 calories (assuming an average of 4 calories/g fat, 4 calories/g protein, and 7 calories/g carbohydrate), we can calculate the number of grams you can eat by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per gram.

Grams of chips = Calories left / Calories per gram
= 200 calories / 7 calories/g

We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams

1. First, we need to determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from a pound, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax for 20 candles.

2. Next, we calculate the total cost of the materials. The cost of the beeswax is $10.00 per pound, so for 2 pounds, it's $20.00. The cost of the wicks isn't specified, but typically, they cost about $0.20 per wick. For 20 candles, that's $4.00. So, the total cost of materials is $20.00 (beeswax) + $4.00 (wicks) = $24.00.

3. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so for 20 candles, he makes $40.00.

4. To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost of materials from the total revenue. So, $40.00 (revenue) - $24.00 (cost) = $16.00.

2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5 articles * 2/5 = 2 articles. Each of these articles also takes 4 hours, so the total time spent on Tuesday is 2 articles * 4 hours/article = 8 hours.

3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday is 2 articles * 2 = 4 articles. The total time spent on Wednesday is 4 articles * 4 hours/article = 16 hours.

4. To find the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days, we add up the time spent on each day: 20 hours (Monday) + 8 hours (Tuesday) + 16 hours (Wednesday) = 44 hours.

1. First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. If the price of each blue tie is $40, and he spent $200 on blue ties, then the number of blue ties he bought is $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.

2. Next, since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

3. Now, we need to find out the cost of each red tie. We know that a red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie. If a blue tie costs $40, then a red tie costs $40 + 0.5 * $40 = $60.

4. Finally, to find out how much John spent on red ties, we multiply the cost of each red tie by the number of red ties he bought: $60 * 10 = $600.

5. To find the total amount John spent on ties, we add what he spent on blue ties and red ties: $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800.

                    question:
                    Lloyd has an ? egg farm. His chickens produce 252 eggs per day and he sells them for ? $2 per dozen. How much does Lloyd make on eggs per week?
                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Lloyd sells in a day.
Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen and there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to find out how many dozens he sells. To do this, divide the total number of eggs by 12:

252 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 21 dozens

Step 2: Calculate Lloyd's daily earnings from egg sales.
Now, that we know Lloyd sells 21 dozens of eggs per day, and he sells each dozen for $2, we can calculate his daily earnings by multiplying the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

21 dozens * $2/dozen = $42

Step 3: Calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales.
To find Lloyd's weekly earnings, we need to know how many days he works in a week. Typically, a week consists of 7 days, so we can assume that's the case here:

$42/day * 7 days/week = $294

The final answer is:
{The final answer is \boxed{294} dollars}</s>","In a week, Lloyd's egg farm produces 252 x 7 = <<252*7=1764>>1764 eggs.
There are 1764/12 = <<1764/12=147>>147 dozens of eggs produced in a week.
So, Lloyd makes 147 x $2 = $<<147*2=294>>294 on eggs.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance Tom travels and the time it takes him to travel back.

First, we know that Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour for a duration of 3 hours, from 1 PM to 4 PM.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, Tom travels back at a rate of 6 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom \boxed{5} hours to get back.</s>","He was travelling at full speed for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours

                [/INST] First, we need to find the total weight of the comic books that Uriah removes. We know that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books. So,

Weight of comic books removed = Number of comic books * Weight of each comic book
= 30 * 1/4
= 7.5 pounds

Next, we need to find the total weight of the toys that Uriah needs to remove to take away 15 pounds from the book and bag. We know that he needs to remove 15 pounds, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds with the comic books. So,

Weight of toys to be removed = Total weight to be removed - Weight of comic books removed
= 15 - 7.5
= 7.5 pounds

Finally, we need to find the number of toys Uriah needs to remove. We know that each toy weighs 1/2 pound, and the total weight of the toys that need to be removed is 7.5 pounds. So,

Number of toys to be removed = Weight of toys to be removed / Weight of each toy
= 7.5 / 1/2
= 15

So, Uriah needs to remove \boxed{15} toys to reduce the weight of his book and bag by 15 pounds.</s>","30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5

How much more revenue ; did the mechanic earn on the day with ! higher revenue?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the revenue generated from repairing truck tires. The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and repairs 6 truck tires on Thursday. So, the revenue from truck tires is:
   Revenue from truck tires = Price per truck tire * Number of truck tires
   = $60 * 6
   = $360

2. Next, we calculate the revenue from car tires. On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 4 car tires at a rate of $40 per tire. So, the revenue from car tires on Thursday is:
   Revenue from car tires (Thursday) = Price per car tire * Number of car tires
   = $40 * 4
   = $160

3. On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires. The revenue from car tires on Friday is:
   Revenue from car tires (Friday) = Price per car tire * Number of car tires
   = $40 * 12
   = $480

4. Now, we add up all the revenues to find the total revenue for both days:
   Total revenue = Revenue from truck tires on Thursday + Revenue from car tires on Thursday + Revenue from car tires on Friday
   = $360 + $160 + $480
   = $1000

5. The question asks for the difference in revenue between the days. However, it doesn't specify which day is the day with higher revenue. To find the difference, we need to compare the revenue from each day.

6. The revenue from Thursday is $360 (truck tires) + $160 (car tires) = $520.
   The revenue from Friday is $480 (car tires).

7. The difference in revenue is:
   Difference = Revenue from Friday - Revenue from Thursday
   = $480 - $520
   = -$40

8. However, this result is negative, which means the mechanic earned less on Friday than on Thursday. The final answer is that the mechanic earned $160 more on Thursday than on Friday.

{The final answer is: The mechanic earned $160 more on Thursday than on Friday.}</s>","On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.
On Friday the mechanic charged a total of 12*40 = $<<12*40=480>>480.
Thus, on Thursday, the day with higher revenue, the mechanic had 520-480 = $<<520-480=40>>40 more revenue than on Friday.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. The Doubtfire sisters have adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter.
2. Their mother informs them that their first cat, Patchy, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. So, Patchy's kittens would be 3 times 7, which equals 21.
3. The other cat, Trixie, has had 12 kittens.
4. To find out the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we add the adopted kittens, Patchy's kittens, and Trixie's kittens.

So, the final calculation would be: 7 (adopted kittens) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40 kittens.

Therefore, {The final answer is The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens.}</s>","Patchy has just had 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 kittens

Let's denote the original price of the groceries as X. The 25% fee on this amount would be 0.25X. So, the total amount Stephen was charged for the groceries including the 25% fee would be X + 0.25X.

The total amount Stephen was charged for the groceries including the 25% fee was $40.00. So, we have the equation:

X + 0.25X = 40

Solving for X, we get:

X = 40 / 1.25
X = 32

So, the original price of the groceries was $32.00.

Next, let's add the $3.00 delivery fee and the $4.00 tip to the original price of the groceries to get the final price.

Final price = Original price + Delivery fee + Tip
Final price = $32.00 + $3.00 + $4.00
Final price = $39.00

If the streaming company charged her the initial ! amount . for the first half of the year and then charged her 10% less money on the other half of the year, calculate the total ; amount she , had paid for the streaming service by the end of ! the year.
                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to understand that the first half of the year and the second half of the year each have 6 months.

2. So, Aleena paid the full amount, which is $140, for each of the first 6 months. That's a total of 6 * $140 = $840.

3. For the last 6 months, she paid 10% less. We calculate 10% of $140, which is $14. So, she paid $140 - $14 = $126 for each of these months.

4. In total, she paid $126 * 6 = $756 for the last 6 months.

5. Adding the amounts she paid in both halves of the year, we get $840 + $756 = $1596.

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is \boxed{1596}.</s>","A year has twelve months, so a half of the year is 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 months,
For the first six months, the streaming service charged her a total of 6*140 = $<<6*140=840>>840
For the next half of the year, the streaming service company charged her 10/100*140 = $<<10/100*140=14>>14 less
She paid $140-$14 = $<<140-14=126>>126 each month for the remaining half of the year,
In total, she paid 126*6 = $<<126*6=756>>756 for the other half of the year for the streaming service.
The total amount of money she paid at the end of the year is $840+$756 = $<<840+756=1596>>1596

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Sophia has already traveled 100 miles on 4 gallons of gas. This means she can travel 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.

2. The owner's manual says that her car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas.

3. If Sophia can travel 25 miles per gallon, and her tank holds 12 gallons, then on a single tank of gas, she can drive 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles.

So, the final answer is that Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.</s>","To find miles per gallon divide 100 miles / 4 gallons = <<100/4=25>>25 miles per gallon

1. First, let's determine how many hours Jim spends watching TV and reading in one day.
   - He watches TV for 2 hours.
   - He reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour.
   - So, in one day, he spends 2 hours (TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours.

2. Next, we need to figure out how many hours he spends on these activities in one week.
   - Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours/week.

3. Finally, we'll calculate how many hours he spends on these activities in 4 weeks.
   - 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

So, Jim spends {36 hours} on TV and reading in 4 weeks.</s>","He reads for 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 hour a night

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the number of people in the girls' and boys' basketball teams for one school. Since each team has 5 players, the total number of players for one school is 5 (girls) + 5 (boys) = 10 players.

Since there are four schools, the total number of players from all schools is 10 players/school * 4 schools = 40 players.

Next, let's calculate the number of coaches. Since each school has sent a coach for each team, each school has sent 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team). Therefore, the total number of coaches from all schools is 2 coaches/school * 4 schools = 8 coaches.

Finally, let's add the total number of players and coaches to find the total number of people sent by all schools. The total number of people is 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{48}.</s>","Each school has sent 1 girls’ basketball team + 1 boys’ basketball team = <<1+1=2>>2 teams.
So each school has sent 2 teams * 5 players per team = <<2*5=10>>10 players.
They have also each sent 2 teams * 1 coach per team = <<2*1=2>>2 coaches.
In total, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = <<10+2=12>>12 people.
Therefore, the schools have sent a total of 12 people per school * 4 schools = <<12*4=48>>48 people.

Step 3: Identify the number of emeralds
There were twice the number of emeralds than rubies, so we multiply the number of rubies by 2.
140 * 2 = 280 emeralds

Step 4: Add all the gems together
To find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together.

                [/INST] Solution:

1. Calculate the total number of students in a day:
   - During the weekdays, Judy teaches 5 classes a day, with 15 students in each class, which gives us $5 \times 15 = 75$ students.
   - On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes, with 15 students in each class, which gives us $8 \times 15 = 120$ students.

2. Calculate the total number of classes in a week:
   - On the weekdays, she teaches $5$ classes a day for $5$ days, which gives us $5 \times 5 = 25$ classes.
   - On Saturday, she teaches $8$ classes.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.

Total cost before interest = Number of cell phones * Cost per cell phone
Total cost before interest = 5 * $150
Total cost before interest = $750

Next, let's calculate the total interest.

Total interest = Total cost before interest * Interest rate
Total interest = $750 * 2%
Total interest = $15

Now, we add the total interest to the total cost before interest to get the total cost after interest.

Total cost after interest = Total cost before interest + Total interest
Total cost after interest = $750 + $15
Total cost after interest = $765

Finally, we divide the total cost after interest by the number of months to get the amount Shiela will pay each month.

Payment per month = Total cost after interest / Number of months
Payment per month = $765 / 3
Payment per month = $255

{The final answer is \boxed{255}}.</s>","A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.

1. First, we need to round each of Artie's flower prices to the nearest dollar. Marigolds are $2.74, which rounds to $3.00, petunias are $1.87, which rounds to $2.00, and begonias are $2.12, which also rounds to $2.00.

2. Next, we calculate how much Artie makes from each type of flower. For marigolds, he sells 12 pots at $3.00 each, so that's 12 * $3.00 = $36.00. For petunias, he sells 9 pots at $2.00 each, so that's 9 * $2.00 = $18.00. For begonias, he sells 17 pots at $2.00 each, so that's 17 * $2.00 = $34.00.

3. Finally, we add up the amounts from each type of flower to find out how much Artie makes in total. That's $36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00.

Let's denote the square footage of the top level as S_top, the square footage of the second level as S_sec, the square footage of the third level as S_thr, and the square footage of the fourth level as S_fou. We know that S_top = 16 square units.

Since each level has half the square footage as the level below it, we can write:
S_sec = 1/2 * S_top = 1/2 * 16 = 8 square units
S_thr = 1/2 * S_sec = 1/2 * 8 = 4 square units
S_fou = 1/2 * S_thr = 1/2 * 4 = 2 square units

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels to find the average:

Average (S) = (S_top + S_sec + S_thr + S_fou) / 4
Average (S) = (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4
Average (S) = 30 / 4

                    question:
                    Cecilia just bought a new puppy. According : to her veterinarian, she has to feed . the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for : the first 180 days. Then she has to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for : the rest of its life. If ; one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many ! bags of dog , food will Cecilia use in the first year?
                [/INST] Cecilia's new puppy will need to be fed dog food in two different ways:

1. For the first 180 days, Cecilia will need to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day. So, the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days can be calculated as follows:
   Dog food for first 180 days = Daily food (for the first 180 days) x Number of days
   = 1 cup/day x 180 days
   = 180 cups

2. After 180 days, the puppy will start receiving 2 cups of dog food every day. We know that there are 365 days in a year. So, the number of days the puppy will receive 2 cups of dog food every day in the first year is:
   Dog food for the rest of the year = Total days in a year - Days with 1 cup food
   = 365 days - 180 days
   = 185 days
   Now, to find out how much dog food is needed for these 185 days, we perform the following calculation:
   Dog food for the rest of the year = Daily food (for the rest of the year) x Number of days
   = 2 cups/day x 185 days
   = 370 cups

Now, we can find out the total amount of dog food needed in the first year by adding the dog food needed for the first 180 days and the dog food needed for the rest of the year:
   Total dog food for the first year = Dog food for first 180 days + Dog food for the rest of the year
   = 180 cups + 370 cups
   = 550 cups

Finally, we need to determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need, given that one bag contains 110 cups:
   Number of bags = Total dog food for the first year / Dog food per bag
   = 550 cups / 110 cups/bag
   = 5 bags

Therefore, {Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year}.</s>","The number of cups of dog food given for the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = <<180*1=180>>180 cups
The number of days left in the year is 365 - 180 = <<365-180=185>>185
The number of cups of dog food given for the rest of the first year is 185 * 2 = <<185*2=370>>370 cups
The total number of cups given in the first year is 180 + 370 = <<180+370=550>>550 cups
The number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = <<550/110=5>>5 bags

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. We know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

2. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, if we denote the amount of laundry David does as D, then Sarah does 4D pounds of laundry.

3. We already have the equation for Sarah's laundry from step

2. So, 4D = 400 pounds.

4. To solve for D, we divide both sides of the equation by 4. So, D =

400. This means David does 100 pounds of laundry.

5. Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, if we denote the amount of laundry Raymond does as R, then R = 1/2 * Sarah's laundry.

6. So, R = 1/2 * 400 = 200 pounds.

7. Finally, we need to find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. So, the difference is R - D = 200 - 100.

The final answer is \boxed{100}.</s>","If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does 1/2*400 = 200 pounds of laundry.
Sara also does 4 times as much laundry as David, meaning David does 400/4 = <<400/4=100>>100 pounds of laundry.
The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200-100 = <<200-100=100>>100 pounds

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's think step by step:

1. First, we need to determine the number of packages for each price option when purchasing 18 flowers.
   - For the $2.50 option, Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3. To find out how many packages he would need, we divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers in each package: 18 / 3 = 6 packages.
   - For the $1 option, Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 2. To find out how many packages he would need, we divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers in each package: 18 / 2 = 9 packages.

2. Next, let's calculate the total cost for each option:
   - For the $2.50 option, the cost would be the number of packages * the cost per package: 6 * $2.50 = $15
   - For the $1 option, the cost would be the number of packages * the cost per package: 9 * $1 = $9

3. Finally, we can find the savings by subtracting the lower cost option from the higher cost option: $15 - $9 = $6

So, Vincent saves $\boxed{$6}$ by buying 18 flowers at the better price.</s>","Find how many packages of 3 would be needed which is 18 ÷ 3 = <<18/3=6>>6.

Find how many packages of 2 would be needed which is 18 ÷ 2 = <<18/2=9>>9.
The cost of using packages of 2 is 9 × $1 = $<<9*1=9>>9.
Vincent would save $15 - $9 = $<<15-9=6>>6.

1. The cost of the grooming before the discount is $100.

2. John gets a 30% discount. To find the amount of the discount, we calculate 30% of $100.

The calculation is: (30/100) * $100 = $30.

3. Now, to find the final cost after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the original cost.

The calculation is: $100 - $30 = $70.

So, the final answer is: \boxed{70}.</s>","The groomer gave a 100*.3=$<<100*.3=30>>30 discount

1. The two girls each got 1/6 of the total 24 liters of water. So, together they got 2*(1/6)*24 = 8 liters.

2. Then, a boy got 6 liters.

3. So, the total amount of water that the two girls and the boy got is 8 + 6 = 14 liters.

4. Therefore, the amount of water left is the total amount of water (24 liters) minus the amount of water that the two girls and the boy got (14 liters).

The final answer is, $\boxed{10}$ liters.</s>","Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.
So the two girls got a total of 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 liters.

1. First, we calculate the total number of roses by multiplying the number of rose bushes by the number of roses in each bush. This gives us:
Total Roses = Number of Rose Bushes * Roses per Bush
Total Roses = 3 * 25
Total Roses = 75

2. Next, we calculate the total number of thorns by multiplying the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose. This gives us:

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of games they lost as L.
2. According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won can be represented as W = L + 8.
3. The total number of games played is 22, so we have L (lost games) + W (won games) + D (draw games) = 22. Since there were no draws mentioned, D = 0.
4. Now we substitute W from step 2 into our equation: L + (L + 8) + 0 = 22.
5. Simplifying this gives us 2L + 8 = 22.
6. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us 2L = 14.
7. Dividing by 2, we get L = 7.
8. Substituting L = 7 into the equation W = L + 8, we get W = 7 + 8 = 15.

So, the football team won {The final answer is 15} games.</s>","Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.

2. Company policy: 10% salary increase every year after five years of service.

Now let's calculate Sylvie's annual salaries for the next three years:

Year 1:
Salary before increase = Initial salary = $600
Salary increase = 10% of initial salary = 0.10 * $600 = $60
New salary = Salary before increase + Salary increase = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Salary before increase = Previous salary = $660
Salary increase = 10% of previous salary = 0.10 * $660 = $66
New salary = Salary before increase + Salary increase = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Salary before increase = Previous salary = $726
Salary increase = 10% of previous salary = 0.10 * $726 = $72.6
New salary = Salary before increase + Salary increase = $726 + $72.6 = $798.6

                [/INST] First, we need to calculate how much potato salad each child will eat. Since a child eats half as much as an adult, and an adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, a child will eat:
    10 lbs (adult portion) / 2 = 5 lbs (child portion)

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the children. There are 5 children, and each child eats 5 lbs of potato salad, so:
    5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs (for children)

Then, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults. There are 20 adults, and each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, so:
    20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs (for adults)

Finally, to find out how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we add the amount needed for the children and the amount needed for the adults:
    25 lbs (for children) + 200 lbs (for adults) = 225 lbs

Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to have enough to feed everyone. Therefore:
The final answer is {225}.</s>","Half of 10 pounds is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 pounds.

To feed 5 dinosaur children, he will need 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25 pounds of potato salad.

1. We know that Cindy has four pets.

2. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. So, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. So, Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets.

4. To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has. So, the total number of pets is 4 (Cindy's pets) + 6 (Marcia's pets) + 18 (Jan's pets) = 28 pets.

1. Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
2. Lee used to be able to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, which means Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles was 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.
3. Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find his improved speed, we need to calculate the 10% increase on his original time, which is 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds.
4. Therefore, Gerald's new time after improving his diet is his original time minus the 10% decrease, which is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

So, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in \boxed{36} seconds with his improved diet.</s>","If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles, then Gerald initially would run the 400-meter hurdles in 38+2=<<38+2=40>>40 seconds.

                [/INST] Let's denote the number of rabbits as R, the number of dogs as D, and the number of cats as C. We are given the following information:

1. The number of rabbits is equal to the number of dogs and cats combined minus twelve. This can be written as: R = D + C - 12

2. There are two cats for every dog. This can be written as: C = 2D

3. The number of dogs is 60. This can be written as: D = 60

Now let's solve this step by step:

Step 1: Substitute the value of D and the expression for C into the first equation:
R = D + C - 12
R = 60 + 2D - 12

Step 2: Substitute the value of D into the equation:
R = 60 + 2*60 - 12
R = 60 + 120 - 12
R = 60 + 108
R = 168

Step 3: Now we have the number of rabbits. We can calculate the total number of pets by adding the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total pets = R + D + C
Total pets = 168 + 60 + 2*60
Total pets = 168 + 60 + 120
Total pets = 348

So, the final answer is:

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to find out how many boys and girls there are in Grade 5. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the total number of students by 2/5.

Number of boys = Total students * 2/5
   = 200 * 2/5
   = 80

2. Since the rest of the students are girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students to find out how many girls there are.

Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
   = 200 - 80
   = 120

3. Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, we calculate the number of girls in the girl scout by multiplying the total number of girls by 2/3.

Number of girls in girl scout = Number of girls * 2/3
   = 120 * 2/3
   = 80

4. Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in girl scout = Number of girls - Number of girls in girl scout
   = 120 - 80

So, the final answer is {40}.</s>","There are 200 x 2/5 = <<200*2/5=80>>80 boys in Grade 5.

                [/INST] Let's break this down:

1. First, we need to figure out the initial volume of the tomatoes. Since Freda loses half their volume after cooking, the 32 ounces of sauce were half of the initial volume.

2. So, the initial volume of the tomatoes was 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

3. Next, we need to figure out how many 16-ounce cans Freda used. Since each can contains 16 ounces, the number of cans is the initial volume divided by the volume per can, which is 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

4. Finally, we know that each can contains three tomatoes. So, the number of tomatoes used is the number of cans multiplied by the number of tomatoes per can, which is 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{12}.</s>","Tomatoes lose half their volume when made into sauce, so Freda started with 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces of tomatoes.

Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway. Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, and 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit to avoid the traffic jam. We need to find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

Step 2: Analyze the total number of cars
After 30 minutes, all the cars (except the 5 that took an exit) have passed through the traffic jam. Since we know that 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes, we can determine the total number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes
Total cars that drove through (excluding the 5 that took an exit): 30 (initial cars) - 5 (took an exit) = 25 cars

Total cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes: 25 cars (from Step 3) - 20 cars (from the last 15 minutes) = 5 cars

Final answer:
The final answer is \boxed{5}.</s>","The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.

2. Mary received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. So, after receiving these plants, her total number of potted plants becomes:
   Total potted plants = Initial potted plants + New potted plants = 80 plants + 18 plants = 98 plants

3. Next day, Mary will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family. That means she will give away 40 plants (1 plant per ledge). So, the total number of potted plants she will have after giving some away is:

                [/INST] Sure, I'd be happy to help with this problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate how many glasses of water John drinks during the weekdays. He has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which makes 3 glasses per meal. Since he does this every weekday, that's 3 glasses times 5 days, which equals 15 glasses.

2. On the weekends, John has a soda with dinner instead of water. So, on weekends, he still drinks 3 glasses of water with breakfast and lunch, but he doesn't drink water with dinner. That's 3 glasses times 2 days, which equals 6 glasses.

3. Therefore, in a week, John drinks a total of 15 (weekdays) + 6 (weekends) = 21 glasses of water.

So, the final answer is that John drinks 21 glasses of water in a week.</s>","John has 4 glasses of water a day on each of the 5 weekdays, for 4*5= <<4*5=20>>20 glasses.

                [/INST] To find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to calculate the total number of ""covering"" actions that are needed, then multiply that by the time it takes for each action.

First, let's determine how many 3-mile segments are in the city. To do this, we divide the total length of the city by the length of each segment:

Segments = Total length / Length per segment
         = 42 miles / 3 miles
         = 14 segments

Now that we know there are 14 segments, we can calculate the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city. We multiply the number of segments by the time it takes for each segment:

Total time = Number of segments * Time per segment
           = 14 segments * 10 minutes
           = 140 minutes

So, it will take \boxed{140} minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.</s>","The city will be covered in 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 intervals of 10 minutes.

1. First, we need to find out how many pieces Poppy placed on the board. Since she placed a quarter of the pieces, we can calculate the number of pieces as follows: 1000/4 = 250 pieces.

2. After Poppy placed her pieces, we subtract that number from the total number of pieces to get the number of pieces left. So, 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces.

3. Then, her mom placed a third of the remaining pieces. So, we calculate a third of what was left: 750/3 = 250 pieces.

4. Finally, we subtract the number of pieces her mom placed from the number of pieces left after Poppy placed her pieces. So, 750 - 250 = 500 pieces.

So, {The final answer is 500 pieces}. This is the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed on the board.</s>","Poppy has placed 1000 pieces / 4 = <<1000/4=250>>250 pieces.

Her mom therefore places 750 / 3 = <<750/3=250>>250 pieces.
This leaves a total of 750 – 250 = <<750-250=500>>500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to understand that the thickness of the walls doesn't affect the inner volume. So, we can ignore it for now.

2. The volume of a box can be calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. In this case, the dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.

3. So, the volume of one box would be 5 * 6 * 4 = 120 cubic inches.

4. Since John has 3 such boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes would be 3 * 120 = 360 cubic inches.

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 360 cubic inches. {The final answer is 360 cubic inches}</s>","The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
So each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width

1. Frankie watched TV after he finishes his homework every night.

2. He watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show on Monday and Tuesday. So, that's 2 hours.

3. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's denote the number of these episodes as x.

4. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. So, that's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.

5. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes. So, that's 2 hours.

6. In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Now, let's set up an equation to solve for x:

2 (Monday and Tuesday) + x*0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7

Solving for x:

2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

                [/INST] Let's think through this situation step by step:

1. Henry wants to make ""twice as many as"" the number of cookies he made last year. Let's represent the number of cookies he made last year as C. So, he sets out to make 2C cookies this year.

2. However, he ends up making 15 more cookies than he planned, which means he actually made (2C + 15) cookies.

3. He then drops 5 cookies while putting them out to cool, so he now has (2C + 15 - 5) cookies.

4. We know that after all of these steps, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

2C + 15 - 5 = 110

5. Simplifying the equation, we get:

2C + 10 = 110

6. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:

2C = 100

7. Finally, dividing both sides by 2, we find the value of C:

So, {The final answer is: 50}.</s>","Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.
He had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.
Therefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into clear steps:

1. First, we calculate the total cost of buying 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon.
   Cost = Price per gallon * Number of gallons
   = $3.00/gallon * 10 gallons
   = $30.00

2. Next, we calculate the total cashback given by the app company.
   Cashback = Cashback per gallon * Number of gallons
   = $0.20/gallon * 10 gallons
   = $2.00

3. Finally, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final amount to be paid with cashback rewards.
   Final cost = Total cost - Total cashback
   = $30.00 - $2.00
   = $28.00

Therefore, after the cashback rewards, someone who buys 10 gallons of gas will have to pay {The final answer is} $28.00.</s>","Gas is $3.00 a gallon and they buy 10 gallons of gas so that's 3*10 = $<<3*10=30.00>>30.00

Beatrice's roll-ups were 24 rolls long and 2 roll-ups wide, so the total number of roll-ups Beatrice had is 24 * 2 = 48 roll-ups.

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had.

Marcell's roll-ups were 14 rolls long and 3 roll-ups wide, so the total number of roll-ups Marcell had is 14 * 3 = 42 roll-ups.

Now, let's add the total number of roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice had to find the total number of roll-ups they had together.

Total roll-ups = 48 (Beatrice's roll-ups) + 42 (Marcell's roll-ups) = 90 roll-ups.

To find the average number of roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 (since there are 2 people).

1. First, let's calculate the total distance Julia needs to row. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so:

Total distance = Distance per second * Time to reach shore
               = 20 feet / 16 seconds * 64 seconds
               = 80 feet

2. Next, let's calculate the total amount of water Julia's boat takes in. The boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, so:

Total water intake = (Total distance / 10 feet) * 2 liters
                   = (80 feet / 10 feet) * 2 liters
                   = 16 liters

So, the final answer is:

1. There are 4 teachers in the classroom.

2. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.

3. In each lesson, the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times.

                       = 6

Now that we know a single teacher cleans the whiteboard 6 times in a day, we can calculate the total number of cleans for all teachers:

Total cleans = Cleanings per teacher * Number of teachers
             = 6 * 4

                    , Sasha notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few . months after she bought ? some lumber. Since she has leftovers, she decides to sell them. ? She has leftover ten 2 : x 4 ! x ? 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?
                [/INST] First, let's calculate how much Sasha got the lumber for.

For the 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards, she paid $10 each, so in total, she paid 10 * $10 = $100.

For the 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards, she paid $16 each, so in total, she paid 5 * $16 = $80.

So, Sasha got all the lumber for a total of $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, it's said that the prices for lumber have gone up by 50% in the last few months. So, we need to calculate the original price of the lumber.

The current price of the lumber is $180. After a 50% increase, this means the original price was 100/150 * $180 = $120.

Sasha sold the lumber for $180, and the lumber was worth $120 originally. So, she made a profit of $180 - $120 = $60.

{The final answer is $60}.</s>","She bought the 2 x 4s for $100 because 10 x 10 = 100
She bought the 4 x 4s for 80 because 5 x 16 = 80
She paid $180 for the lumber because 100 + 80 = <<100+80=180>>180
The same number now sells for $270 because 180 x 1.5 = <<180*1.5=270>>270
She made $90 in profit because 270 - 180 = <<270-180=90>>90

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and then find out how many parts are represented by the teaspoons of sugar.

1. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:

13. The total parts in this ratio are 7 (for sugar) + 13 (for water) = 20 parts.

2. We are given that the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons. We need to find out how many of the 20 parts this represents.

3. To do this, we divide the total teaspoons of sugar by the number of parts for sugar: 120 teaspoons ÷ 7 parts/teaspoon = 17.14 parts.

4. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a part in this context, we need to round this to the nearest whole number. Since 17.14 is closer to 17 than to 18, we round down to 17 parts.

5. Therefore, Katy used 17 parts of the sugar ratio, which corresponds to 17 × 5 = 85 teaspoons of sugar (since 5 teaspoons is the size of one part in this problem).

So, the final answer is: Katy used {85} teaspoonfuls of sugar.</s>","The total ratio representing the ingredients she used to make the coffee is 7+13 = <<7+13=20>>20

                [/INST] First, we need to calculate the total number of shoes John bought. Since he bought 2 pairs for each of his 3 children, we multiply the number of pairs by the number of children:

Total shoes = Pairs per child * Number of children
                  = 2 * 3
                  = 6

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of these shoes. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we multiply the cost per pair by the total number of shoes:

Total cost = Cost per pair * Total shoes
                 = $60 * 6
                 = $360

The officer counted 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. So the total number of vehicles cleared on the first day is:
2 containers * 5 vehicles per container = 10 vehicles

Step 2: Determine the number of vehicles that were cleared on the second day.
The total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Subtracting the number of vehicles cleared on the first day gives:
30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Step 3: Calculate the number of containers that were imported on the second day.
Assuming all the containers contain 5 vehicles, the number of containers can be calculated by dividing the number of vehicles by the number of vehicles per container:

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago.

2. Four years ago, Adrien's salary was $40000.

3. Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. So, his new salary is $40000 + ($40000 * 0.40) = $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

4. Adrien's salary is now $56000, which is 30% more than Lylah's salary at the time. So, to find Lylah's salary, we need to subtract that 30% increase from Adrien's current salary.

5. Lylah's salary four years ago was $40000 / (1 + 0.30) = $40000 / 1.30 = $30769.23 (approximately).

6. Four years later, if Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, we need to find their new salaries.

7. Adrien's salary is $56000, as calculated earlier.

8. Lylah's salary four years ago was $30769.

23. If her salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's original salary (30%), her new salary is $30769.23 + ($30769.23 * 0.30) = $30769.23 + $9230.77 = $40000.

9. Now, we can calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later.

10. Adrien was earning $56000, and Lylah was earning $40000.

11. So, the total salary they were receiving four years later is $56000 + $40000 = $96000.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{96000}.</s>","Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.
In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000
After receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200
In total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
- Morisette's total fruits = 5 (apples) + 8 (oranges) = 13 fruits
- Kael's total fruits = 10 (apples) + 4 (oranges) = 14 fruits

Next, let's find out how many hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday. She slept 2 hours less than Monday each day, so:

Tuesday's sleep hours = Monday's sleep hours - 2
= 8 - 2
= 6 hours

Wednesday's sleep hours = Tuesday's sleep hours - 2
= 6 - 2
= 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours Sadie slept for these two days:

Total sleep hours for Tuesday and Wednesday = Tuesday's sleep hours + Wednesday's sleep hours

For the rest of the week, Sadie slept 1 hour more than those two days. Since there are 5 days in a week, and she has already accounted for three days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), this means she had 2 days left (Thursday and Friday):

Sleep hours for the remaining two days = Sleep hours for Tuesday and Wednesday + 2
= 10 + 1*2

Finally, let's find the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week:

Total sleep hours for the week = Sleep hours on Monday + Sleep hours for Tuesday and Wednesday + Sleep hours for the remaining two days

1. First, let's calculate how many miles Rosie runs in the first 3 hours. She runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, so after 3 hours, she would have run:

Distance = Speed * Time
   Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
   Distance = 30 miles

2. After the first 3 hours, Rosie's speed decreases to 5 miles per hour. She has 4 hours left to run after the first 3 hours (7 hours total minus the 3 initial hours), so in those 4 hours, she will run:

Distance = Speed * Time
   Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
   Distance = 20 miles

3. To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the distances from both parts of her journey:

Total Distance = Distance in first 3 hours + Distance in last 4 hours

1. Julia is preparing for a dinner party and needs spoons for serving stew.
2. She notices she is out of plastic spoons and buys a new package.
3. Her husband also buys a new package of spoons and gives them to Julia.
4. Julia uses three spoons to sample her stew.
5. Later, she has a total of 12 spoons.

We know that Julia used three spoons for tasting her stew, and she ended up with 12 spoons. This means that the spoons from both packages (one from Julia and one from her husband) and the 3 spoons she used equal 12 spoons. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'.

So, we have the equation: x (spoons in Julia's package) + (5 spoons from her husband's package) - 3 (spoons used for tasting) = 12.

Solving this equation gives us: x + 5 - 3 = 12 => x = 12 + 3 - 5 => x = 10.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we know that Lily made 50 friends. This is given in the problem.

2. Next, we're told that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. So, we add 20 to the number of friends Lily made. That's 50 + 20.

3. The total number of friends Amy and Lily have together is then the sum of the number of friends each of them has. So, we add the number of friends Lily has (which is 50) to the number of friends Amy has (which we calculated to be 70).

Let's do the calculations:

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
= 50 + 20
= 70

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
= 70 + 50
= 120

So, the final answer is {120}. Lily and Amy have a total of 120 friends together.</s>","If Lily made 50 friends, Amy made 50+20 =<<50+20=70>>70 friends.
Together, they made 70+50 = <<70+50=120>>120 friends at the new school.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we know that each pepper costs $15.

2. A watermelon costs three times the price of a pepper. So, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $\boxed{45}.

3. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs. So, the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $\boxed{40}.

4. Dillon wants to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.

5. Therefore, the total cost for the watermelons is 4 * $45 = $\boxed{180}.

6. The total cost for the peppers is 20 * $15 = $\boxed{300}.

7. The total cost for the oranges is 10 * $40 = $\boxed{400}.

8. Finally, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 (watermelons) + $300 (peppers) + $400 (oranges) = $\boxed{880}.

So, Dillon will spend a total of $880.</s>","A watermelon costs three times what pepper costs, which is 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
An orange price is 45 - 5= $<<45-5=40>>40.

He also purchases peppers at a total price of 20 * 15 = $<<20*15=300>>300.
The oranges cost him a total of 10 * 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.

                [/INST] First, we need to calculate the total amount of time spent on patients in a day.

The total number of patients seen in a day is 500.
Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, so the total time spent on patients is:
Total time = Number of patients * Time per patient
Total time = 500 * 24 minutes
Total time = 12000 minutes

Now, we need to convert this time into hours, as the charges are given in an hourly basis. We know that:
1 hour = 60 minutes
So,
Total hours = Total time / 60
Total hours = 12000 minutes / 60
Total hours = 200 hours

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for the hospital and the total receipt from patients.

The doctors charge $150 an hour. So, the total cost for the hospital is:
Total cost = Total hours * Cost per hour
Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour
Total cost = $30000

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour. So, the total receipt from patients is:
Total receipt = Total hours * Receipt per hour
Total receipt = 200 hours * $200/hour
Total receipt = $40000

Finally, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total receipt:

Profit = Total receipt - Total cost
Profit = $40000 - $30000
Profit = $10000

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10000 per day from these visits.

{The final answer is: $10000}</s>","The hospital sees patients for 500*24=<<500*24=12000>>12000 minutes a day
That means they see patients for 12000/60=<<12000/60=200>>200 hours a day
They profit 200-150=$<<200-150=50>>50 per hour
So they make a profit of 200 hours * $50/hour = $<<200*50=10000>>10000 a day from patient visits

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we will follow the steps given in the question and break it down further:

1. **Initial Number of Elves**: Nissa hires 60 elves.

2. **First Wave of Quits**: A third of the elves quit after some children vomit on them. To find out how many this is, we calculate a third of the total number of elves:
   \[
   \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ elves quit}
   \]

3. **Remaining Elves After First Quits**: After 20 elves quit, we subtract this number from the initial number to find out how many are left:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ elves remain}
   \]

4. **Second Wave of Quits**: Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kidding kick their shins. We subtract this number from the remaining elves to find the final number:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30 \text{ elves remain}
   \]

Therefore, after the two waves of elves quitting, there are $\boxed{30}$ elves left.</s>","First, divide the starting number of elves by 3 to find out how many quit after being vomited on, which is 60 elves / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 elves.
Then subtract that number from the starting number of elves to find out how many are left: 60 elves - 20 elves = <<60-20=40>>40 elves.
Then subtract the number of elves who quit after being kicked to find the total number who left: 40 elves - 10 elves = <<40-10=30>>30 elves.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many times Fred and Pam rode the luge. The problem states that they both rode the luge ""2 times each,"" but it's missing the number after the word ""luge"" and ""times."" Let's denote the number of times they rode the luge as ""x.""

2. The cost of each ride is 6 tickets. So, the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred on the roller coaster is (2+4)*6 = 6*6 = 36 tickets.

3. Since Fred rode the luge twice, the total number of tickets used by him on the luge is 2x*6. Similarly, since Pam rode the luge twice, the total number of tickets used by her on the luge is 2x*6.

4. Therefore, the total number of tickets used by both of them for all the rides is 36 + 2x*6 + 2x*6 = 36 + 12x.

5. However, the problem doesn't provide enough information to find the exact number of tickets used. We only know that Fred rode the luge twice and Pam rode it the same number of times as Fred. But we don't know the exact number of times they rode the luge (x).

So, without the exact number of times they rode the luge, we can't find the final answer. The final answer depends on the value of x. If we denote the final answer as A, then \boxed{A = 36 + 12x}.</s>","The total times that they ride the roller coaster is 2+4=<<2+4=6>>6 times.
The total times that they ride the luge is 2+2=<<2+2=4>>4 times.

Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday, so he walked 4 + 24 = 28 miles on Monday and Tuesday combined.

Step 3: Calculate the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday.

If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and : 6 hours to complete ! the second one, how many questions did he leave incomplete?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we will break it down into several steps to calculate how many questions Mark completed and how many he left incomplete on both tests.

1. **Calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the first test:**
   Mark completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. He had 8 hours to complete the test, which consisted of 75 questions. To find out how many questions he completed, we multiply the rate by the time:
   \[
   \text{Questions completed on the first test} = 8 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 40 \text{ questions}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the second test:**
   For the second test, which consisted of 100 questions, Mark also completed them at a rate of 5 questions per hour. He had 6 hours to complete the test. Using the same calculation method:
   \[
   \text{Questions completed on the second test} = 6 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 30 \text{ questions}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of questions Mark completed on both tests:**
   To find out the total number of questions Mark completed, we add the questions completed on the first test to the questions completed on the second test:
   \[
   \text{Total questions completed} = 40 \text{ questions} + 30 \text{ questions} = 70 \text{ questions}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of questions Mark left incomplete:**
   To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we subtract the total number of questions he completed from the total number of questions on both tests:
   \[
   \text{Questions left incomplete} = (75 \text{ questions} + 100 \text{ questions}) - 70 \text{ questions} = 175 \text{ questions} - 70 \text{ questions} = 105 \text{ questions}

                [/INST] To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. We know that there are 20 cars in total, and 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is 20 - 12 - 4 = 4.

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100. So, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is (4/20)*100 = 20%.

The final answer is {20%}.</s>","12 + 4 = <<12+4=16>>16 cars are either automatic or manual.
So, 20 - 16 = <<20-16=4>>4 cars are semi-automatic.
Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 4/20 x 100% = 20%.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are 700 bees in total.

2. We are told that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. Let's denote the number of baby bees as B and the number of worker bees as W. So, W = 2B.

3. We are also told that there are twice as many babies as queens. Let's denote the number of queens as Q. So, B = 2Q.

4. From step 2 and step 3, we can say that W = 4Q (since W = 2B and B = 2Q).

5. We know that the total number of bees is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens. So, 700 = W + B + Q.

6. Substituting W = 4Q and B = 2Q into the equation, we get 700 = 4Q + 2Q + Q.

7. Simplifying this, we get 700 = 7Q.

8. So, Q = 100.

9. Substituting Q = 100 into W = 4Q, we get W = 400.

So, the final answer is that there are 400 worker bees. {The final answer is 400 worker bees}.</s>","Let x represent the number of queens

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to calculate how much time Jordan spends playing video games in a week. We know he plays for 2 hours every day, so over 7 days, that would be:
   Time_spent = 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours

2. Next, we need to calculate how much money Jordan would make if he were working during his video game time instead of playing. We know he earns $10 an hour at his job, so over 14 hours, he would make:
   Money_earned = $10/hour * 14 hours = $140

Therefore, the final answer is: {Jordan would earn $140}.</s>","Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day x 7 days in a week = <<2*7=14>>14 hours a week.

                [/INST] Firstly, we calculate the total cost of all items excluding tax. The cost of milk is $2, eggs are $3, light bulbs are $3, cups are $3, and roach traps are $4. So the total cost before tax is:

\[2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = \$16\]

Since the tax applies only to nonfood items, we identify the nonfood items in the list. These are light bulbs ($3), cups ($3), and roach traps ($4). So the cost of nonfood items before tax is:

\[3 + 3 + 4 = \$10\]

The tax rate is 10%, so the tax on the nonfood items is:

\[10\% \times 10 = \$1\]

Adding this tax to the total cost before tax gives us the final total cost:

\[16 + 1 = \$17\]

Therefore, the final answer to the total cost, including tax, is \{The final answer is $17\}.</s>","The foodstuff cost 2+3=$<<2+3=5>>5

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total expenses for cleaning each client's home.
Each client's home needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The cost of each bottle of bleach is $2, and the cost of a pack of cloths is $5. Therefore, the total cost for cleaning each client's home is 2*$2 + $5 = $9.

Step 2: Calculate the total expenses for all clients, both current and potential.
Kim already has 3 clients, and he is confident enough to include another 5 potential clients in his calculations. Therefore, the total number of clients is 3 + 5 = 8. Since each client's home costs $9 to clean, the total expenses for all clients are 8*$9 = $72.

Step 3: Determine the profit.
Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses. Kim expects to make $92 each week, and his total expenses are $72. Therefore, the profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

The final answer is {The final answer is $20}.</s>","Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.
Each week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.
Each week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.
The bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.
The packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we follow these steps:

1. First, we calculate the total number of pineapples on John's field. Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare and John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples is:
\[10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 = 1000 \text{ pineapples}\]

2. Next, we determine how many times John can harvest his pineapples within a year. Since he can harvest every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year, the number of harvests per year is:
\[12 \text{ months} / 3 = 4 \text{ harvests per year}\]

3. Finally, to find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests per year:

1. First, let's find out how many pieces were in the second box. It had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one. So, it had 500 * 3 = 1500 pieces.

2. Next, let's find out how many pieces were in the third box. It had 1/4 the number of pieces as the 500 piece one. So, it had 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

3. Now, let's add up all the pieces from the three boxes to find out how many blocks Johnny picked up. So, the total number of pieces is 500 (from the first box) + 1500 (from the second box) + 125 (from the third box) = 2125 pieces.

So, the final answer is {Johnny picked up 2125 blocks}.</s>","The first set had 500 pieces, and the second set had 3 times as many as the first set, so the second set has 500*3=<<500*3=1500>>1500 pieces

   - Unicycle: $1 \times 2 = 2$ tires
   Adding these together, we get the total number of tires: $10 + 9 + 2 = 21$ tires.

2. **Calculate the total earnings**: Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of tires by the cost per tire:

                    question:
                    Dave : bought a large pack ? of french , fries , and ate fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the pack out of his hand. When the seagull landed, he gobbled ? down half ? the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Then three pigeons , bullied him away ! from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries. Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?
                [/INST] Let's work through this step by step:

1. We know that after a seagull ate half of what Dave ate, there were still fries left. Let's denote the total number of fries Dave ate as F. So, after the seagull ate, there were F/2 fries left.

2. Then, three pigeons ate three fries each, so they ate 3*3 = 9 fries.

3. After the pigeons ate, there were F/2 - 9 fries left.

4. Then, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. After the raccoon ate, two thirds of F/2 - 9 were left, which is (2/3)(F/2 - 9).

5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off one fry. So, the remaining fries are (2/3)(F/2 - 9) - 1.

6. We know that after the ants carried off one fry, there were five left. So, (2/3)(F/2 - 9) - 1 = 5.

7. Now we solve this equation for F. Multiplying both sides by 3/2 to get rid of the fraction, we get F/2 - 9 = 15.

8. Adding 9 to both sides, we get F/2 = 24. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get F = 48.

9. Since Dave ate fourteen fries, there were 48 - 14 = 34 fries left when Dave bought the pack.

However, the question asks for the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it, which is the original number of fries, not the number of fries left. So, the final answer is 48 fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

Final Answer: \boxed{48}</s>","Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.
The 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.
The ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.
The raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.
Thus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.

1. Calculate the total number of classes Kimo has in a week.
   - On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day. So, $3 \times 3 = 9$ classes on these days.
   - On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day. So, $2 \times 2 = 4$ classes on these days.
   - Therefore, the total number of classes in a week is $9 + 4 = 13$ classes.

2. Calculate the total number of classes in one semester.
   - Since there are 16 weeks in one semester, the total number of classes in one semester is $16 \times 13 = 208$ classes.

3. Calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester.
   - On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, each class is 1 hour long. So, $1 \times 9 = 9$ hours are spent on these days.
   - On Tuesdays and Thursdays, each class is 2 hours long. So, $2 \times 4 = 8$ hours are spent on these days.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is $9 + 8 = 17$ hours per week.
   - Since there are 16 weeks in one semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is $17 \times 16 = 272$ hours.

1. Convert the length of the baguettes into inches:
Each baguette is two feet long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

2. Calculate the total length of all the rolls in inches:
There are 300 rolls, each 4 inches long, so the total length of the rolls is 300 * 4 = 1200 inches.

3. Calculate the total length of all the chocolate croissants in inches:
There are 120 chocolate croissants, each 6 inches long, so the total length of the chocolate croissants is 120 * 6 = 720 inches.

4. Calculate the total length of all the baguettes in inches:
There are 60 baguettes, each 24 inches long, so the total length of the baguettes is 60 * 24 = 1440 inches.

5. Add the total lengths of the rolls, chocolate croissants, and baguettes:
The combined length of all the baked goods is 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate how many bananas the zookeeper needs to feed all the apes (monkeys, gorillas, and baboons) every month.
   - For monkeys, he needs 200 bananas.
   - For gorillas, he needs 400 bananas.
   - For baboons, he needs 100 bananas.
   - So, in total, he needs 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas per month.

2. Next, we need to calculate how many bananas he needs for 2 months.
   - If he needs 700 bananas per month, for 2 months, he would need 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the distance Blake runs.
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a football field that is 100 yards long. Each time he runs back and forth, he covers a distance of 200 yards (100 yards to the other end and 100 yards back). So, the total distance Blake runs is 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

Step 2: Calculate the distance Kelly runs initially.
Kelly runs back and forth once, covering a distance of 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance she runs each time she does this is 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back). So, the total distance Kelly runs initially is 200 + 34 * 80 = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Step 3: Calculate the distance Kelly runs after she decides not to run next to Blake.
After Blake and Kelly decide not to run next to each other, Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance she runs each time she does this is 80 yards. So, the total distance Kelly runs after she decides not to run next to Blake is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards.

Step 4: Compare the distances run by Blake and Kelly to find the winner.
Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2920 yards initially. Blake runs further. However, if we compare the distances run after they decide not to run next to each other, Kelly runs 2720 yards and Blake still runs 3000 yards. So, Blake wins the contest.

Step 5: Calculate the difference in the distances run by the winner and the loser.
The difference in the distances run by Blake and Kelly is 3000 - 2920 = \boxed{80} yards.</s>","Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200

5. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so she caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.
6. Locsin caught 6 * 5 = 30 sea horses, 5 starfish, and 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish, which totals to 30 + 5 + 5 = 40 fish.

                [/INST] This problem can be solved using a step-by-step approach to calculate the increased price of the bag of marbles each time the price increases by 20% of its original price, twice a year.

Given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, within a year (which is 12 months), the price would increase twice (every six months).

Step 1: Calculate the increase in the price after each year.

After the first six months (which is half a year), the price will increase to 1.2 times its original price.

Step 2: Calculate the increase in the price after 12 months (which is a full year).

The price after 12 months will be increased by an additional 20% from the price after 6 months.

So, the price after 12 months will be: 1.2 (from the first half of the year) * 1.2 (from the second half of the year) = 1.44 times the original price.

Step 3: Calculate the price after 6 years (since 36 months is 3 years).

We continue the same kind of calculation for 6 years.

The price after 18 months will be 1.2 times the price after 12 months = 1.2 * 1.44 = 1.728 times the original price.

The price after 36 months will be 1.2 times the price after 18 months = 1.2 * 1.728 = 2.0736 times the original price.

Hence, the price of the bag of marble after 36 months will be 2.0736 times the original price, which is $41.472 (since 2.0736 * $20 = $41.472).

Final answer: The bag of marbles will cost \boxed{41.472} after 36 months.</s>","When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we know that one action figure costs $5.
2. The problem states that three action figures and one red car cost $4. But from step 1, we know that three action figures cost $15 (3 * $5). This means that one red car costs $4 - $15 = -$11. But since it's not possible for a car to cost a negative amount, there seems to be a mistake in the problem.
3. If we assume that the problem meant ""the doll is worth as much as the three action figures and the red car combined,"" we can calculate the cost of the doll as follows: $15 (from the three action figures) + $5 (from the red car) = $20.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of eggs Sandra needs to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, the total number of eggs needed is calculated as follows:

- Total eggs needed = Number of flans $\times$ Eggs per flan
- Total eggs needed = $15 \times 3$
- Total eggs needed = $45$ eggs

Next, we determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get enough eggs. Since she receives a basket of 9 eggs each time she babysits, the number of times she needs to babysit is found by dividing the total eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting:

- Number of babysittings = Total eggs needed $\div$ Eggs per babysitting
- Number of babysittings = $45 \div 9$
- Number of babysittings = $5$

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit $\boxed{5}$ times to get enough eggs for making 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraiser.</s>","Sandra needs a total of 15 x 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 eggs.

                [/INST] Let's denote Seth's current age as 's' and Brooke's current age as 'b'.

Step 1: Seth is twice as old as Brooke.
This can be represented as the equation: s = 2b

Step 2: In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.
This can be represented as the equation: (s + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Step 3: Substitute the first equation into the second equation.
Replacing 's' in the second equation with '2b' from the first equation, we get: (2b + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Step 4: Simplify and solve for 'b'.
Simplifying the equation, we get: 3b + 4 = 28. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives: 3b = 24. Dividing both sides by 3 gives: b = 8.

Step 5: Substitute 'b' back into the first equation to find 's'.
Substituting 'b' back into the equation s = 2b, we get: s = 2 * 8 = 16.

The final answer is:
\boxed{16}</s>","To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.
Then we add all the values together, 3x + 4 = 28.
And we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 – 4.
Then we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.
We find that x = <<8=8>>8, or Brooke’s age is 8.
Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.

1. First, let's calculate the total distance he walks during the weekdays. Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the distance he walks during the weekdays is:

Weekday distance = Distance per weekday * Number of weekdays
Weekday distance = 20 miles/day * 5 days
Weekday distance = 100 miles

2. Next, let's calculate the total distance he walks during the weekends. Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the distance he walks during the weekends is:

Weekend distance = Distance per weekend day * Number of weekend days
Weekend distance = 10 miles/day * 2 days
Weekend distance = 20 miles

3. Finally, let's add the total distance he walks during the weekdays and weekends to find the total distance he walks in a week:

Total distance = Weekday distance + Weekend distance
Total distance = 100 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 120 miles

1. First, we need to determine the cost of making one gallon of lemonade. They spend $3 on labor, $1 on lemons, and $2 on sugar, so the cost of one gallon is $3 + $1 + $2 = $6.

2. Next, let's find out how much revenue they get from selling one gallon of lemonade. Since they sell 20 glasses per gallon and each glass costs $0.50, they make 20 * $0.50 = $10 from selling one gallon.

3. Now we can calculate their profit per gallon. They make $10 from selling one gallon and it costs them $6 to make it, so their profit per gallon is $10 - $6 = $4.

4. They made a total profit of $25. To find out how many gallons they sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per gallon. So they sold $25 / $4 = 6.25 gallons. Since they can't sell a fraction of a gallon, we'll round this number down to 6 gallons.

1. Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent. So, he spends 6000 * 1/4 = $1500 on rent.

2. He then spends 1/3 of his remaining salary on car fuel. So, he spends (6000 - 1500) * 1/3 = $1500 on car fuel.

                [/INST] First, let's denote the number of crabs Monic has as M and the number of crabs Rani has as R.

According to the problem, Bo has 40 crabs.

The problem states that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so we can write that as:
M = Bo - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36

The problem also states that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so we can write that as:
R = M + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46

Finally, we want to find the total number of crabs all three have together. That's just the sum of the number of crabs each person has, so we can write that as:
Total = Bo + M + R = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122

First, let's determine the number of white carnations. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the following equation:

5 \* WC = 200

Here, WC represents the number of white carnations. Now, let's solve for WC:

WC = 200 / 5
WC = 40

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can determine the number of red roses by multiplying the number of white carnations by 4:

Red roses = 4 \* WC
= 4 \* 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred needs to deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to satisfy Sandra's order.

\boxed{160} red roses must be delivered by 5 pm.</s>","Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies / 5 = <<200/5=40>>40 white carnations.

                [/INST] First, we need to calculate the total time each team will take to complete their relay.

Step 1: Calculate the total time for the well-rounded team.
Each runner on the well-rounded team runs a 400-meter leg in 55 seconds. As there are four runners, the total time for this team is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

Step 2: Calculate the total time for the less-well-rounded team.
The first runner takes 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the times are 60, 57, 54, and 51 seconds. The total time for this team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Step 3: Calculate the difference in time between the two teams.
The well-rounded team takes 220 seconds and the less-well-rounded team takes 222 seconds. So, the faster team wins by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

{The final answer is 2}.</s>","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row, and then compare these probabilities.

1. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3:
There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6).
So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

2. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6).
So, the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6.
And if Jerry rolls an even number on the first roll, the probability of rolling another even number is also 3/6.
Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4 or 25%.

3. Comparing the probabilities:
The difference in probability is 50% (probability of rolling a number greater than 3) - 25% (probability of rolling two even numbers in a row) = 25%.

So, the final answer, expressed as a percentage, is The final answer is \boxed{25\%}.</s>","There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.

                [/INST] Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step:

1. Russell distributes straw among small rodents (rats and hamsters) and rabbits.
2. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, with each rat getting 6 pieces of straw.
3. There are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster getting 5 pieces of straw.
4. In a pen of rabbits, 20 pieces of straw are distributed.
5. A total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents.

First, let's find out how many straws are left for the rats after distributing straw to hamsters and rabbits:

Straw distributed to hamsters:

10 cages * 5 straws/hamster * 40 straws (total hamsters) = 200 straws

Straw distributed to rabbits:

20 straws (total straws for rabbits)

Now, let's subtract the straws given to hamsters and rabbits from the total 160 straws distributed to small rodents:

160 straws - 20 straws (hamsters) - 20 straws (rabbits) = 120 straws (rats)

Now, let's find out how many rats are in each cage:

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can divide the total number of rats by 3 to find out how many rats are in each cage:

120 rats / 3 cages = 40 rats per cage

So, there are 40 rats in each cage.

{The final answer is: 40 rats per cage.}</s>","In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Mandy needs to pay back to Benedict, including the interest.

1. First, let's calculate the monthly interest. The monthly interest rate is 2%, so we need to calculate 2% of the principal amount ($100) each month.
   Monthly interest = Principal amount * Monthly interest rate / 100
   Monthly interest = $100 * 2 / 100 = $2

2. Next, we need to calculate the total interest for 3 months.
   Total interest = Monthly interest * Number of months
   Total interest = $2 * 3 = $6

3. Finally, we add the total interest to the principal amount to find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict.
   Total amount = Principal amount + Total interest
   Total amount = $100 + $6 = $106

So, {The final answer is} Mandy should give Benedict $106.</s>","The monthly interest is $100 x 2/100 = $<<100*2/100=2>>2.

3. The trader sells each bag for $30, so the profit per bag is $30 - $22 = $8.

4. The total profit is given as $400. To find out how many bags the trader sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag: $400 / $8 = 50 bags.

                    Three friends : spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. They also went on 2 different rides which costs $33 for each ride. If they agreed to split all the ; costs evenly, how much . did ; each of : them pay?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on tickets**: The friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets.

2. **Determine the amount spent on food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, the amount spent on food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent on rides**: They went on 2 rides, each costing $33. Therefore, the total cost for rides is $33 * 2 = $66.

4. **Find the total amount spent**: Adding the amounts spent on tickets, food, and rides gives us the total amount spent: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

5. **Divide the total amount by the number of friends to find out how much each friend paid**: There are 3 friends, so each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

Therefore, each friend paid $\boxed{34}.$</s>","They spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $<<20.25-4.5=15.75>>15.75 on food.
They spent $33 x 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66 for the rides.
They spent a total of $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.
So each of them paid $102/3 = $<<102/3=34>>34.

                [/INST] First, we need to determine how many peaches John collects per hour. We know that he collects 2 peaches per minute, so in an hour (which has 60 minutes), he would collect:

2 peaches/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 120 peaches/hour

Next, we need to determine how many peaches John collects in 3 hours. We can do this by multiplying the number of peaches he collects per hour by the number of hours:

120 peaches/hour * 3 hours = 360 peaches

1. The flock consists of 10 ducks, and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects each week. So, the total amount of insects needed per week for the flock is: 10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck = 35 pounds/week

Next, let's find out how many pounds of insects are needed per day:

2. We know there are 7 days in a week, so to find out how many pounds of insects are needed per day, we divide the total amount of insects needed per week by 7: 35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the final answer is:

                [/INST] First, let's figure out how many trees Tom plants and chops down each year.

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year.

The net increase in trees per year is therefore:
10 trees (planted) - 2 trees (chopped down) = 8 trees

Next, we'll calculate how many trees Tom has after 10 years without considering the 30% that die.

Total trees after 10 years = Initial number of trees + (Net increase in trees per year * Number of years)
= 50 trees + (8 trees/year * 10 years)
= 50 trees + 80 trees
= 130 trees

Now, we'll account for the 30% of trees that die after 10 years.

Trees after accounting for death = Total trees after 10 years * (1 - Fraction of trees that die)
= 130 trees * (1 - 0.3)
= 130 trees * 0.7
= 91 trees

So, Tom has {91} trees left after 10 years, accounting for the trees that die.</s>","He gets 10-2=<<10-2=8>>8 new trees a year
After 10 years he has 8*10=<<8*10=80>>80 new trees

1. Initially, there are 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard.

2. On Saturday morning, the neighbors take back one third of the flamingos. One third of 18 is 6. So, they take back 6 flamingos.

3. This leaves 18 - 6 = 12 flamingos still out on Sue's front yard.

4. They paint these 12 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard.

5. On Sunday morning, they add another 18 pink flamingos, making the total number of pink flamingos out 12 (from Saturday) + 18 (from Sunday) = 30.

6. So, at noon on Sunday, there are 30 pink flamingos and 12 white flamingos out on Sue's front yard.

The final answer is \boxed{30 - 12 = 18}. At noon on Sunday, there are 18 more pink plastic flamingos out than white plastic flamingos.</s>","On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many crayons Violetta can buy with her $20. We know that one crayon costs $2. So, we divide the total amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. This gives us:

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost per crayon
   = $20 / $2
   = 10 crayons

2. Violetta wants crayons in 5 different colors. Since she is buying 10 crayons, we need to find out if this will give her at least one crayon in each color.

To do this, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of colors. If the result is at least 1, then she will have at least one crayon in each color.

Number of colors in each crayon = Total crayons / Number of colors
   = 10 / 5
   = 2

Since the result is 2, this means Violetta will have at least 2 crayons in each color.

3. Now, we need to find out how much change she will get. To do this, we multiply the number of crayons she bought by the cost of one crayon, and then subtract this from the total amount of money she has.

Change = Total money - (Number of crayons * Cost per crayon)
   = $20 - (10 * $2)
   = $20 - $20
   = $0

Therefore, Violetta will get no change.

{The final answer is: No change.}</s>","Violetta is going to pay 5 * 2 = $<<5*2=10>>10 for the crayons she wants.

1. We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. We also know that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30.

2. So, the cost of a pen is equal to the cost of a pencil plus the cost of an eraser, which is $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

3. Now, we want to find out how much 8 pens will cost.

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. In the first month, she collected three times that number. So, she collected 20 * 3 = 60 cards.
3. Now, she has 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) = 80 cards.
4. In the second month, she collected 20! fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. Since '!' usually denotes factorial, and the context doesn't seem to fit here, we'll assume it's a typo and interpret it as '20 less'. So, she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards in the second month.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, we divide this number by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 publishers = 500 sentences per publisher

2. Next, we calculate how much Mark makes from Publisher A. Since Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, and he edits 500 sentences for them, we multiply these numbers.

5 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 250 cents

3. Now, we need to find out how much Publisher B pays per sentence. We know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:

2 * 5 cents/sentence = 10 cents/sentence

4. Finally, we calculate how much Mark makes from Publisher B. Since he edits 500 sentences for them, and they pay him 10 cents per sentence, we multiply these numbers.

10 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 500 cents

5. To find out how much Mark makes in a week from both publishers, we add the amounts from Publisher A and Publisher B.

250 cents (from Publisher A) + 500 cents (from Publisher B) = 750 cents

So, Mark makes 750 cents in a week, in cents. {The final answer is 750 cents}.</s>","Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we follow these steps:

1. First, we calculate the total grapes produced by Josie's farm per year. Since each of the 10 acres produces 5 tons of grapes per year, the total grapes produced is:
\[10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons per acre} = 50 \text{ tons}\]

2. Next, we determine how many barrels of wine can be produced from the grapes. Given that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, the total barrels of wine produced is:
\[50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels per ton} = 100 \text{ barrels}\]

Therefore, the final answer, indicating the number of barrels of wine produced by Josie's farm per year, is:
\[\boxed{100}\]</s>","If each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, then her ten-acre farm produces 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 tons of grapes per year.

1. For the sandwiches, Carl ate one sandwich every day for 7 days. Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese. So, for the sandwiches, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese.

2. For the omelets, Carl ate them for 3 days. Each omelet used one more slice of cheese than the sandwiches, so each omelet used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese. For the omelets, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese.

3. For the macaroni and cheese dish, Carl used 8 slices of cheese.

4. To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we add the numbers from each part: 14 (for the sandwiches) + 9 (for the omelets) + 8 (for the macaroni and cheese dish) = 31 slices of cheese.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
   The sum of the scores is calculated by adding all the scores together:
   Sum = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

2. Subtract the lowest score from the sum.
   Brinley is allowed to remove the lowest score from the average. Here, the lowest score is 71.
   So, the new sum is 438 - 71 = 367

3. Calculate the desired new average.
   Brinley wants to have an average of 93 after removing the lowest score. So, the sum of the remaining scores should be equal to the total points she needs to achieve this average, which is calculated by multiplying the desired average by the number of scores (6 in this case).
   Desired sum = 93 * 6 = 558

4. Calculate the score Brinley needs on the sixth test.
   To find out the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, subtract the sum of the first five scores (without the lowest one) from the desired sum.
   Score needed = Desired sum - New sum = 558 - 367 = 191

So, the final answer is {Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93}.</s>","First, identify the lowest score, which is 71, and remove it.
Since Brinley wants a score of 93, we know her total score needs to be 93 (average) * 5 (tests) = <<93*5=465>>465 points
So far, Brinley has earned 89 + 92 +100 + 86 = <<89+92+100+86=367>>367 points
The final test must be 465 - 367 = <<465-367=98>>98 points.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. This means the cost of twenty dozen cups is equal to the cost of half a dozen plates minus $1200.

2. We also know that the selling price of each plate is $6000. Half a dozen plates would cost 6 * $6000 = $36000.

3. So, according to step 1, the cost of twenty dozen cups is equal to $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

4. Now, we need to find the total cost of buying each cup. Since there are 24 cups in twenty dozen, we divide the total cost by the number of cups.

Final calculation: $34800 / 24 = $1450.

\boxed{1450} is the total cost of buying each cup.</s>","Since a dozen has 12 items, half a dozen plates are 12/2 = <<6=6>>6
Half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each cost 6*$6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000
Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800
Since a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.
If the twenty dozen cups cost $34800, each cup costs $34800/240=$<<34800/240=145>>145

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and the two pairs of shoes.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost is:

Cost of jacket + Cost of two pairs of shoes
= $30 + $20*2
= $30 + $40
= $70

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting in one session.

She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits them 4 times. So, the total money she earns from babysitting is:

Money earned from babysitting = $5 * 4
= $20

Now, let's calculate how much more money Sara needs after she starts babysitting.

She started with $10 saved and now she has an additional $20 from babysitting. So, she has:

Total money after babysitting = $10 + $20
= $30

But she still needs $70 to buy the jacket and the two pairs of shoes. So, the additional money she needs is:

Additional money needed = $70 - $30
= $40

Finally, let's calculate how many times she must mow the lawn to earn this additional $40.

Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. So, the number of times she must mow the lawn is:

Number of times she must mow the lawn = $40 / $4
= 10

Therefore, {The final answer is} Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.</s>","Both pairs of shoes will cost a total of 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.

Sara has earned 4 * $5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 from babysitting.
Between her savings and the babysitting, Sara has already saved $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=30>>30.
Sara needs to earn an additional $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 from mowing the lawn to afford her clothes.

1. Let's use algebra to solve this. Let X be the number of red chickens Jerry has, and (X + 2) will be the number of white chickens.

2. The total number of eggs produced by red chickens each day is 3X (since each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day).

3. The total number of eggs produced by white chickens each day is 5(X + 2) (since each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day).

4. According to the problem, Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. So, 3X + 5(X + 2) = 42.

5. Simplifying the equation gives us: 3X + 5X + 10 = 42.

6. Combining like terms results in 8X + 10 = 42.

7. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us 8X = 32.

8. Dividing both sides by 8 gives us X = 4.

So, the answer to the question is: Jerry has 4 red chickens.</s>","First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4

= 2 * (1.5 miles + 6 miles)
= 2 * 7.5 miles
= 15 miles

Now, we know that Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his walking speed.

Time spent walking = Total distance / Walking speed

                    question:
                    Jerry has two pools, both with leaks emptying them . out at 4 gallons/minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water ? as the small pool. Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How ? much water does the small pool ; have : now?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as S gallons and the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago as B gallons. According to the problem, at that time, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write this as B = 2S.

2. Now, let's consider the changes that have occurred since then. The big pool and the small pool both have leaks emptying them at 4 gallons/minute. Therefore, in 4 minutes, both pools have lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

3. So, the amount of water in the small pool now is S - 16 gallons and the amount of water in the big pool now is B - 16 gallons.

4. According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can write this as B - 16 = 4(S - 16).

5. Now we have a system of two equations:
   B = 2S
   B - 16 = 4(S - 16)

6. Substitute B = 2S into the second equation: 2S - 16 = 4(S - 16).

7. Solve for S: 2S - 16 = 4S - 64, which simplifies to 2S = 48, so S = 24.

8. So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Now, it has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons of water left.

\boxed{8} gallons of water does the small pool have now.</s>","First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons
Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out the total cost of the items Lori wants to buy. This is the cost of the shoes plus the cost of the belt.
   Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt = $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

2. Next, we need to know how much money Lori earns for each hour she works. This is given as her hourly wage.
   Hourly wage = $8.00

3. Now, we can find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn enough money to buy the items. This is the total cost divided by her hourly wage.
   Hours needed = Total cost / Hourly wage = $352.00 / $8.00/hour = 44 hours

So, the final answer is that Lori will have to work for 44 hours to be able to buy the items she wants. {The final answer is 44 hours}.</s>","She wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320.00 and a belt for $32.00 for a total of 320+32 = $<<320+32=352.00>>352.00

                [/INST] First, we need to understand the total amount that Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised an additional 10% of the amount. So, the additional amount is 10/100 * $2000 = $200.

Therefore, the total amount Janeth promised to return is $2000 (the initial borrowed amount) + $200 (the additional amount) = $2200.

Next, we need to calculate how much Janeth will have paid over the 12 months. She is paying $165 a month, so over 12 months, she will have paid $165 * 12 = $1980.

Finally, to find out Janeth's remaining balance, we subtract the amount she has paid from the total amount she promised to return. So, $2200 (the total amount returned) - $1980 (the amount paid) = $220.

{The final answer is $220}.</s>","Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.
So she is going to pay off a total of $2000 + $200 = $<<2000+200=2200>>2200.
Janeth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.
Hence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.

                    Chad ordered a build-your-own ! burrito for lunch.  The base burrito is $6.50.  He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for , $1.00 and 2 sauces for $0.25 each.  , He decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00 which will add chips . and a drink.  ; He has a ! gift card for $5.00 that he uses at check out.  How much does he , still owe?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the cost of the burrito without any extra items. The base burrito costs $6.50.

2. Next, we add the extra meat. This costs $2.00, so the total cost so far is $6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50.

3. Then, we add the extra cheese. This costs $1.00, so the total cost is now $8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50.

4. We also add avocado, which costs $1.00, so the total cost becomes $9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50.

5. Chad decides to add 2 sauces. Each sauce costs $0.25, so the total cost for the sauces is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. The new total cost is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00.

6. Then, Chad upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00. This includes chips and a drink. Now, the total cost is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

7. Finally, Chad uses a $5.00 gift card at checkout. So, the amount he still owes is $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

So, the final answer is \boxed{9}.</s>","He orders 2 sauces at $0.25 each so 2*.25 = $<<2*.25=0.50>>0.50 for sauce
He orders extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00 and $0.50 for sauce for a total of 2+1+1+.50 = $<<2+1+1+.5=4.50>>4.50 in extras
His burrito cost $6.50 and he adds $4.50 in extras and upgrades his meal for $3.00 so now he owes, 6.50+4.50+3 = $<<6.50+4.50+3=14.00>>14.00
He has a $5.00 gift card and his current bill is $14.00 so he will owe 14-5 = $<<14-5=9.00>>9.00

Next, let's calculate how many pieces they can add together per minute. Kalinda can add 4 pieces and her mom can add 2 pieces, so together they can add 6 pieces per minute.

Now, let's calculate how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360 piece puzzle. Since they can add 6 pieces per minute, it will take them 360 / 6 = 60 minutes to complete the puzzle.

Finally, let's convert these minutes into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them 60 / 60 = 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

                [/INST] First, let's find out how many baby watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

The number of baby watermelons ready for harvest after two months = Total number of baby watermelons * Percentage ready for harvest
= 120 * 0.3
= 36

So, after two months, 36 baby watermelons were ready for harvest.

After Ashlyn took these 36 baby watermelons, the remaining number of baby watermelons is

Remaining baby watermelons = Total number of baby watermelons - Baby watermelons ready for harvest
= 120 - 36
= 84

Then, Ashlyn came back two weeks later and found that 3/4 of the remaining baby watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of baby watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks is

Baby watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks = Remaining baby watermelons * Fraction ready for harvest
= 84 * (3/4)
= 63

So, after two weeks, there are 63 baby watermelons ready for harvest.

Now, the number of baby watermelons not ready for harvest after two weeks is

Baby watermelons not ready for harvest = Remaining baby watermelons - Baby watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks
= 84 - 63

                [/INST] To calculate the total cost Mark pays for the fleet of 12 cars, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost before tax and registration:** Each car is sold for $20,000, and Mark buys 12 of them. So, the initial cost is:
   \[
   \$20,000 \times 12 = \$240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax:** Mark pays a 10% tax on the cars. The tax amount on the total cost before tax is:
   \[
   \$240,000 \times 0.1 = \$24,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the registration fee:** Mark also pays a $1,000 registration fee for each car. For 12 cars, this adds up to:
   \[
   \$1,000 \times 12 = \$12,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:** To find the total cost Mark pays, we add the cost before tax, the tax, and the registration fee:
   \[
   \$240,000 + \$24,000 + \$12,000 = \$276,000

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $\boxed{\$276,000}$.</s>","The cars cost 20000*12=$<<20000*12=240000>>240,000

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of tomatoes Steve eats per day:** Given that Steve eats twice as many tomatoes as his girlfriend, and he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we can calculate the number of tomatoes his girlfriend eats per day as follows:
   \[
   \text{Tomatoes eaten by girlfriend per day} = \frac{\text{Tomatoes eaten by Steve per day}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]
   Therefore, Steve eats $3$ more tomatoes per day than his girlfriend, and in total, they eat $6 + 3 = 9$ tomatoes per day.

2. **Convert weekly tomato consumption to per day:** Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we need to find out how many tomatoes are needed per day to calculate the number of vines required. There are 7 days in a week, so the daily consumption would be:
   \[
   \text{Daily tomato consumption} = \frac{\text{Weekly tomato consumption}}{7} = \frac{9}{7} \approx 1.29
   \]
   However, since a vine can only produce an integer number of tomatoes per day, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is $2$ tomatoes per vine per day.

3. **Calculate the number of vines required:** Finally, to find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total daily tomato consumption by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per day:
   \[
   \text{Number of vines} = \frac{\text{Total daily tomato consumption}}{\text{Tomatoes per vine per day}} = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
   \]
   Since Steve can't have half a vine, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means Steve needs $5$ vines to meet his daily tomato consumption needs.

Therefore, the final answer, encapsulated as requested, is $\boxed{5}$.</s>","His girlfriend eats 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 tomatoes per day
So together they eat 6+3=<<6+3=9>>9 tomatoes a day
That means they eat 9*7=<<9*7=63>>63 tomatoes a day

                [/INST] John needs to order at least 2 pizzas to ensure his 20 friends get 4 slices each.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Each pizza has 8 portions.
2. John wants each of his 20 friends to have 4 slices. This means he needs a total of 20 friends * 4 slices/friend = 80 slices.
3. Since each pizza has 8 portions, we can divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza to find the number of pizzas needed. So, 80 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas.
4. However, since pizzas are only sold in whole pizzas, and each pizza has 8 portions, John cannot order 10.5 pizzas (5/8 of a pizza would not be enough for 5 friends).
5. Therefore, John must order at least 2 pizzas. This may not be enough to ensure each friend gets 4 slices, but it's the minimum he can order.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.

2. He uses the ink from these 25 pens to make new ones.

3. To make one new pen, he needs the ink from 5 empty pens.

4. So, the ink from 25 pens can be used to make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

5. Since he started with 25 pens, he now has 25 - 5 = 20 pens left.

6. He then uses these 20 pens to make new ones.

7. To make one new pen, he needs the ink from 5 empty pens.

8. So, the ink from 20 pens can be used to make 20 / 5 = 4 new pens.

9. Since he started with 20 pens, he now has 20 - 4 = 16 pens left.

10. He then uses these 16 pens to make new ones.

11. To make one new pen, he needs the ink from 5 empty pens.

12. So, the ink from 16 pens can be used to make 16 / 5 = 3 new pens.

13. Since he started with 16 pens, he now has 16 - 3 = 13 pens left.

14. He then uses these 13 pens to make new ones.

15. To make one new pen, he needs the ink from 5 empty pens.

16. So, the ink from 13 pens can be used to make 13 / 5 = 2 new pens.

17. Since he started with 13 pens, he now has 13 - 2 = 11 pens left.

18. He then uses these 11 pens to make new ones.

19. To make one new pen, he needs the ink from 5 empty pens.

20. So, the ink from 11 pens can be used to make 11 / 5 = 2 new pens.

21. Since he started with 11 pens, he now has 11 - 2 = 9 pens left.

22. He then uses these 9 pens to make new ones.

23. To make one new pen, he needs the ink from 5 empty pens.

24. So, the ink from 9 pens can be used to make 9 / 5 = 1 new pen.

25. Since he started with 9 pens, he now has 9 - 1 = 8 pens left.

26. He then uses these 8 pens to make new ones.

27. To make one new pen, he needs the ink from 5 empty pens.

28. However, he only has 8 pens left, which is not enough to make a new pen.

                [/INST] First, let's find out Joan's age. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, and Jessa is 20 years old, we add 5 to Jessa's age to find Joan's age.

Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 years old

Now, let's find out Mary's age. Since Mary is two years younger than Joan, and Joan is 25 years old, we subtract 2 from Joan's age to find Mary's age.

Mary's age = Joan's age - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 years old

Finally, let's find the sum of the ages of the three girls. We add together the ages of Jessa, Joan, and Mary.

Sum of the ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 years old

So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68 years old.

If after a meeting ; 30% of the ; students went out of the building through exit A, 3/5 of the remaining went out . through exit B, and the rest went out through exit ; C, calculate the number of , students who went out through exit C.
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 1000 students in the hall.

2. 30% of these students go out through exit A. That's 30/100 * 1000 = 300 students.

3. Now, there are 1000 - 300 = 700 students left in the hall.

4. 3/5 of these remaining students leave through exit B. That's 3/5 * 700 = 420 students.

5. Now, there are 700 - 420 = 280 students left in the hall.

6. These remaining students all go out through exit C.

So, the final answer is that {280 students went out through exit C}.</s>","The number of students who went out through exit A is 30/100%1000 = 300 students.
The number of students who didn't use exit A is 1000-300 = <<1000-300=700>>700
3/5 of the students used exit B, a total of 3/5*700 = <<3/5*700=420>>420 students.
If 420 of the remaining students who didn't use exit A used exit B, the number who used exit C is 700-420 = 280 students.

                [/INST] Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. First, we know that John has 54 candies and Robert has half the number of candies John has. So, Robert has 54/2 = 27 candies.

2. Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

3. Finally, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has. So, John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James.

Therefore, \boxed{21} is the answer.</s>","Robert has 54/2 = <<54/2=27>>27 candies.

Step 1: Dolly has two books, and she reads both of her own books and Pandora's book. So, Dolly reads 3 books (2 of her own + 1 from Pandora).

Step 2: Pandora has one book, but she also reads Dolly's two books. So, Pandora reads 3 books (1 of her own + 2 from Dolly).

Step 3: To find out how many books they read collectively, we add the number of books Dolly reads and the number of books Pandora reads.

Final Answer:
Therefore, Dolly and Pandora read a total of 6 books collectively (3 from Dolly + 3 from Pandora).

{The final answer is 6 books.}</s>","There are 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 books in total.

1. Mike is currently pen pals with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is currently writing to 3 people.

2. Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, which are 5 pages long. So, each person sends 2 * 5 = 10 pages a week.

3. Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 10 pages a week for each of the 3 people. Therefore, he writes a total of 3 * 10 = 30 pages a week.

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes Jason uses for his daily calls with his boss. Since he has a 15-minute call with his boss every day and there are 30 days in the month, the total number of minutes he spends on these calls is:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Step 2: Subtract the total number of minutes Jason uses for his calls with his boss from the total number of minutes he has for the month. Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month, so the number of minutes he has left after these calls is:

1000 minutes - 450 minutes = 550 minutes

Step 3: Subtract the number of extra minutes Jason has used from the number of minutes he has left after his calls with his boss. Jason has had 300 extra minutes of call this month, so the number of minutes he has left after all his calls is:

1. Griffin originally had 24 fries and Kyle took 5, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
2. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 5 * 2 = 10 fries.
3. After Billy took his fries, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
4. Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
5. After Ginger gave her fries and Colby took his, Griffin had 27 fries.
6. So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin to make him have 27 fries after everyone's actions must be 27 - 19 = 8.

1. First, let's calculate the cost of makeup for one day. If the makeup artist charges $250 an hour and it takes 6 hours to do the makeup, then the cost for one day is:
   250 * 6 = $1500

2. Now, let's calculate the cost of makeup for one week. Since the makeup needs to be done 4 times a week, the cost for one week is:
   1500 * 4 = $6000

3. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost for the makeup during the filming is:
   6000 * 5 = $30,000

4. After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. So, the discount amount is:
   30000 * 10/100 = $3000

5. Therefore, the total amount Jean pays after the discount is:

1. First, we calculate how many cookies Sue ate on Monday. Since she ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, and her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

2. Next, we calculate how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday. Since she ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, and her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

3. Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days. This would be 20 (from Monday) + 26 (from Tuesday) = 46 cookies.

4. Then, let's calculate the total number of cookies Sue's sister ate over the two days. This would be 5 (from Monday) + 13 (from Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

5. We then subtract the total number of cookies Sue's sister ate from the total number of cookies Sue ate to find the difference. This would be 46 (Sue's total) - 18 (sister's total) = 28 cookies.

6. Finally, since each cookie has 200 calories, we multiply the difference in the number of cookies by 200 to find the difference in calories. This would be 28 (difference in cookies) * 200 (calories per cookie) = 5600 calories.

1. First, we need to find out the total number of boys and girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60 students.

2. Therefore, there are 60 * 0.5 = 30 boys and 30 girls in the school.

3. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

4. Subtracting the number of girls in the first and second classes from the total number of girls in the school, we find that the third class has 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

                    Bill starts ? on the 3rd floor. He rides the , elevator up to the floor that's equal to 4 : times his starting floor plus 6. What floor is Bill on now?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the starting floor**: Bill starts on the 3rd floor.

2. **Calculate the target floor**: The problem states that Bill rides the elevator up to the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6. So, we calculate this as follows:
   - 4 times the starting floor (3) is 4 * 3 = 12.
   - Then, add 6 to this result: 12 + 6 = 18.

3. **Determine Bill's new floor**: Since Bill started on the 3rd floor and the calculation gives us a result of 18, it means he did not end up on a floor above the 3rd floor within the range of a typical elevator in a building (which usually doesn't have floors above 12 or so). This seems to be an error in the problem as given.

However, if we were to consider the first three digits of the result (as it's common in some contexts to consider this in problems involving real-life scenarios), then Bill would be on the 18th floor.

But, based on the standard interpretation of the problem, we have a logical issue. If the starting floor is 3 and the target is 4 times the starting floor plus 6, the target floor should be a number that can be represented as '3' times something plus 6, which is not possible since the starting point is not 3 times something. So, I would suggest revisiting the problem statement to ensure it's accurate and clear.

Final answer: {The problem seems to have a logical issue as the starting floor cannot be interpreted as ""4 times the starting floor plus 6"".}</s>","First multiply Bill's starting floor number by 4: 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12

                [/INST] To determine how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

1. Pennies (1 cent each):
   - He has 100 pennies.
   - Therefore, the total value from pennies is 100 * $0.01 = $1.00.

2. Nickels (5 cents each):
   - He has 40 nickels.
   - Therefore, the total value from nickels is 40 * $0.05 = $2.00.

3. Dimes (10 cents each):
   - He has 20 dimes.
   - Therefore, the total value from dimes is 20 * $0.10 = $2.00.

4. Dollar coins (1 dollar each):
   - He has 40 dollar coins.
   - Therefore, the total value from dollar coins is 40 * $1.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's sum up the total value from all types of coins:

Total value = Value from pennies + Value from nickels + Value from dimes + Value from dollar coins
Total value = $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00
Total value = $45.00

So, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank.

The final answer is {Brody has $45.00}.</s>","Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.
Since nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.
Since a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.
So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the weight of the entire redwood tree before the termites ate into it. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, and the tree is 200 feet tall, there are 20 sections (200 feet / 10 feet per section).
The total weight of the tree is therefore 20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds.

Next, we need to account for the weight lost due to termites. They ate 30% of the tree, so we calculate 30% of 8000 pounds.
30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds.

Finally, we subtract the weight lost from the original weight to find the current weight of the tree.
Current weight = original weight - weight lost = 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

                [/INST] To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of bananas Jamal has**: 
   Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can calculate the number of bananas Jamal has by subtracting 4 from the number of apples Andrea has. 
   \[
   \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Andrea's apples} - 4 = 52 - 4 = 48
   \]

2. **Calculate Andrea's bananas**: 
   Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, we divide the number of bananas Jamal has by 2 to find out how many bananas Andrea has.
   \[
   \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]

3. **Find the total number of fruits**: 
   Now, we add the number of apples and bananas Andrea has to the number of apples and bananas Jamal has to get the total number of fruits.
   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = (\text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas}) + (\text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas})
   \]
   Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.
   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = (52 + 24) + (44 + 48) = 76 + 92 = 168

Therefore, the total number of fruits is $\boxed{168}$.</s>","Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal has 52-8 = <<52-8=44>>44 apples.
The total number of apples is 44+52 = <<44+52=96>>96
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which totals 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
There are a total of 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 bananas.

Total cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies.

Since two cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies.

Cups of flour needed = Total cookies / Cookies per cup of flour

1. **Carmen's Amount**: Carmen has $100.

2. **Samantha's Amount**: Let's denote Carmen's amount as $C$. According to the problem, Samantha has $25 more than Carmen. Therefore, Samantha's amount can be represented as $C + 25$. Since we know Carmen's amount is $100$, we can substitute $C$ with $100$ to find Samantha's amount:
   \[
   \text{Samantha's amount} = C + 25 = 100 + 25 = 125

5. Finally, to find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price. This would be $412,500 - $400,000 = $12,500.

So, the total price of the house is $12,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.</s>","The brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17500.

The total price of the house is $350 000 + $17500 + $42000 = $409 500.
So, it is $409 500 - $400 000 = $<<409500-400000=9500>>9500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan ; amount of the house, how much is . Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?
                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the transfer fees
Mr. Tan paid transfer fees that are 3% of the selling price. The selling price is $400,000. So, the transfer fees amount to:
Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

Step 2: Calculate the brokerage fee
Mr. Tan also paid a brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price. So, the brokerage fee amount to:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

Step 3: Calculate the total costs
Mr. Tan paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. So, the total costs are:
Total costs = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
Total costs = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

Step 4: Calculate the net proceeds
Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house will be the selling price minus the total costs. So, the net proceeds are:
Net proceeds = Selling price - Total costs
Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000

The final answer is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000.</s>","Mr. Tan paid $400 000 x 3/100 = $12 000 for the transfer fees.
He paid $400 000 x 5/100 = $20 000 for the brokerage fee.
So, Mr. Tan paid a total of $12 000 + $20 000 + $250 000 = $282 000 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.
Hence, Mr. Tan's net proceeds is $400 000 - $282 000 = $118 000.

                [/INST] Step 1: Find out how long it takes to heat the oil up to 400 degrees.
Since it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil up to 300 degrees, and it takes 40% longer to heat it up to 400 degrees, we calculate the time difference as 20 minutes * 40% = 8 minutes.
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil up to 400 degrees.

Step 2: Find out how long it takes to cook the chicken.
Since it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to warm up the oil, and we found out in

Step 1 that it takes 28 minutes to warm up the oil, we subtract 5 minutes from 28 minutes.
So, it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

Step 3: Find out the total time passed from starting the oil to having cooked chicken.
Since it takes 28 minutes to heat the oil up to 400 degrees (from

The whole sweater is an ? 1800-stitch project. How many stitches does each sleeve take?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many stitches are in the collar. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches and the collar takes a tenth of that number. So, the number of stitches in the collar is 900/10 = 90 stitches.

2. Next, we find the number of stitches in the rosette. It takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 90*2 = 180 stitches.

3. Now we know the stitches for the body, the collar, and the rosette. Add those up: 900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170 stitches.

4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. If we take away the stitches we've already accounted for, we get 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches left for the sleeves.

5. Since the sweater has two sleeves and they are of equal length, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to get the number of stitches per sleeve. So, 630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

{The final answer is} 315 stitches per sleeve.</s>","The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.
The rosette takes 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 stitches.
The body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = <<900+90+180=1170>>1170 stitches.
Thus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.
Thus, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = <<630/2=315>>315 stitches.

1. Carly started with 80 cards.
2. 2/5 of the cards had the letter A on them. To find out how many cards had the letter A, we multiply the total number of cards by 2/5:

6. 5/8 of the rest of the cards had the letter C on them. To find out how many cards had the letter C, we multiply the remaining number of cards by 5/8:
   (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards with C.

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to dig all the large holes.
Matthew has to dig 15 large holes, and each large hole takes 10 minutes to dig. So, the total time for digging large holes is 15 * 10 = 150 minutes.

Step 4: Add the total times for digging small holes and large holes to find the total time.
The total time is 90 minutes (for small holes) + 150 minutes (for large holes) = 240 minutes.

Step 5: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is equal to 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

{The final answer is: It will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.}</s>","It takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and he needs to dig 30 small holes so it will take 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 minutes
It takes 10 minutes to dig a large hole and he needs to dig 15 large holes so it will take him 15*10 = <<10*15=150>>150 minutes
It will take 90 minutes to dig the small holes and 150 minutes to dig the large holes for a total of 90+150 = <<90+150=240>>240 minutes
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour and he needs to dig for 240 minutes so that's 240/60 = <<240/60=4>>4 hours

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we will first establish the given information:
1. Mico and Marco's combined ages equal 20.

Next, let's create two variables for their different ages. Let Mico's age be represented as m and Marco's age as x.

From the information provided, we can write the following equation:
m + x = 20

Now, we need to find the sum of their ages in 10 years. After 10 years, Mico will be m + 10, and Marco will be x + 10. So, we can write the following equation:
m + 10 + x + 10 = m + x + 20

Since the sum of their ages after a decade is equal to their current combined age plus 20 (10 years for each person), the answer is simply the original sum of their ages, which is 20.

{The final answer is 20}</s>","There will be an additional 10 (for Mico) + 10 9for Marco) = <<10+10=20>>20 to Mico and Marco's current sum of ages in 10 years.

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's denote Sam's age as S. According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's age is 6S.

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can write the equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

3. Now, let's solve this equation:
   - First, distribute the 3 on the right side of the equation: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.
   - Then, subtract 3S from both sides: 3S + 9 = 27.
   - After that, subtract 9 from both sides: 3S = 18.
   - Finally, divide both sides by 3: S = 6.

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

\boxed{6}</s>","Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.
In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
We simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.
Now we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

2. Next, we need to find out the total number of spots among all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so that's 40 * 70 = 2800 spots in total.

3. Similarly, we need to find out the total number of spots among all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so that's 60 * 35 = 2100 spots in total.

4. Now, we add the total number of spots from both cobras and mambas to find the combined total number of spots: 2800 (from cobras) + 2100 (from mambas) = 4900 spots.

   \(12 + 3 + 12 \times 2 = 12 + 3 + 24 = 39\)

2. Next, we need to determine how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:
   \(39 \div 3 = 13\)

3. Finally, we calculate the cost of the pizzas. Since each pizza costs $15, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza:
   \(13 \times $15 = $195\)

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of segments in a necklace and then determine how many of those segments are filled with sterling silver beads.

1. First, let's find out how many segments there are in a necklace. A necklace has one more segment than the number of gemstones. So, for 8 gemstones, there would be 8 + 1 = 9 segments.

2. Each segment is filled either with a topaz gemstone or a sterling silver bead. Since we know the length of each topaz gemstone and the total length of the necklace, we can find out how many gemstones are used. Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, so for a 25-inch necklace, Katerina would use 25 / 1 = 25 gemstones. However, this is more than the 8 gemstones she actually uses, which means she repeats some segments. So, there are 25 / 1 = 25 / 8 = 3.125 cycles of gemstone and bead segments, and since we can't have a fraction of a cycle, this means there are 3 complete cycles and a partial cycle.

3. In each cycle, there is 1 segment filled with a gemstone and 2 segments filled with a bead (since there are two spaces between gemstones that are filled with beads). So, in 3 complete cycles, there would be 3 * 2 = 6 segments filled with beads.

4. The partial cycle will also have 2 segments filled with beads (since there are two spaces between gemstones that are filled with beads, and regardless of how many gemstones are in the partial cycle, there will always be two spaces between them).

5. Therefore, the total number of segments filled with beads is 6 (from the complete cycles) + 2 (from the partial cycle) = 8.

6. Since each bead is one-quarter of an inch long, and there are 8 segments filled with beads, the total length of the beads used is 8 * 0.25 = 2 inches.

7. However, we need to find out how many beads are used, not their total length. Since each bead is one-quarter of an inch long, the number of beads used is the total length of the beads divided by the length of each bead. So, the number of beads used is 2 / 0.25 = 8.

\boxed{8} beads are used per necklace.</s>","8 topaz gemstones, at 1 inch per gemstone, contribute a total of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 inches to each necklace.

1. In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. So, the total number of stories they wrote in the first week is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories.

2. In the second week, the family decided that each of them should double the number of stories they wrote in the first week. This means Alani wrote 2 * 20 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 2 * 40 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 2 * 60 = 120 stories in the second week.

3. The total number of stories they wrote in the second week is 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories.

4. To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the total number of stories they wrote in the first week to the total number of stories they wrote in the second week. This gives us 120 + 240 = 360 stories.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of stars in the first two rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.

For the 8-star rows, there are 2 rows, so 2 * 8 = 16 stars.
For the 6-star rows, there are 2 rows, so 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

The total number of stars in these rows is 16 + 12 = 28 stars.

The total number of stars in the 76-star flag is 76 stars.

To find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows, we subtract the number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars.

So, 76 - 28 = 48 stars.

Now, to find out how many 5-star rows there are, we divide the number of stars in these rows by the number of stars in each 5-star row.

So, 48 / 5 = 9.6. But since we can't have a fraction of a row, this means there must be 9 rows of 5 stars and 1 row with 3 stars (since 48 modulo 5 equals 3).

But the question specifies that the rest are 5-star rows, so we disregard the 1 row with 3 stars.

Therefore, there are 9 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. So, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Next, we need to find out how long the car in the fast lane traveled to cover 480 miles. Time = Distance / Speed. So, the time the car in the fast lane took is 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

Since the cars in both lanes were traveling for the same amount of time, the car in the slow lane also took 8 hours to cover the same distance.

Finally, to calculate the distance the car in the slow lane covered, we multiply its speed by the time it traveled. So, the distance is 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles.

Together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. How many medals have been given out for counting?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ali has won 22 medals for counting super fast. These are the medals he has won.

2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali. This means Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

3. Together, they have 10 times less medals than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means they have 1/10 of the total medals given out.

4. So, if we let X represent the total number of medals given out for counting, we can set up the equation: 1/10 * X = 22 (Ali's medals) + 17 (Izzy's medals)

5. Simplifying the equation gives us: 1/10 * X = 39

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults.
Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of chocolate bars.
Subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find the remaining number of chocolate bars. So, 40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars.

Step 4: Calculate the number of chocolate bars each child gets.
There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. So, each child gets 16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars.

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.
2. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
3. Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

After 3 rounds:
- Mike: 21 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 42 points

In the fourth round, each player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike will get an extra point because he has more than 20 points.
- Jim will not get an extra point because he has exactly 20 points (18 + 2).
- Tony will get an extra point because he has more than 20 points.

After the fourth round:
- Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
- Jim: 18 + 0 = 18 points
- Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Now, let's add up the total points after the fourth round:

On the second day, he did 100+20 = 120 pushups,
since he did ten fewer squats, he did 50-10 = 40 squats,
and he doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so he did 20*2 = 40 presses.

Now, let's find out the total count of activities he did on the first day:
The total count on the first day is 100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 presses = 170 activities.

And on the second day, it's 120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 presses = 200 activities.

To find out the total count of activities he did in the two days, we need to add the total counts on the first and the second days:

                [/INST] To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members who each consume 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily rice consumption:**
   Each member consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 5 members, the total consumption per meal is:
   \[
   5 \times 0.2 \, \text{kg} = 1 \, \text{kg}
   \]
   Since they eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is:
   \[
   2 \times 1 \, \text{kg} = 2 \, \text{kg}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly rice consumption:**
   To find out how much rice is consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week (7 days):
   \[
   2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{kg/week}
   \]

3. **Determine how long the rice will last:**
   Now we compare the total weekly consumption with the available rice:
   \[
   \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}
   \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last the household 3 weeks.



To determine the area in square meters of the region enclosed by the ellipse, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the equation of the ellipse:**
   The given equation of the ellipse is:
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{y^2}{16} = 1
   \]
   This is the standard form of an ellipse equation where the semi-major axis \( a = 4 \) and the semi-minor axis \( b = 2 \).

2. **Calculate the area of the ellipse:**
   The area \( A \) of an ellipse is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \pi \times a \times b
   \]
   Substituting the values of \( a \) and \( b \):
   \[
   A = \pi \times 4 \times 2 = 8\pi
   \]

Therefore, the area of the region enclosed by the ellipse is \(\boxed{8\pi \, \text{square meters}}\).</s>","Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.
So, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = <<0.4*5=2>>2 kg of rice per day.
In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.
Thus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.

1. Calculate the number of crates Sam sold on each day:
   - On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
   - On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
   - On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
   - Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

2. Add the number of crates sold on each day to find the total number of crates sold during the week:
   - Total crates sold = 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) + 20 (weekend)
   - Total crates sold = 65 crates

3. Compare the total number of crates sold to the weekly target to find out how many crates Sam was off from his target:
   - Weekly target = 120 crates
   - Crates sold = 65 crates
   - Crates off target = Weekly target - Crates sold
   - Crates off target = 120 crates - 65 crates
   - Crates off target = 55 crates

So, Sam was off from his target by 55 crates.

                [/INST] Let's break it down step by step:

1. Carmen starts bidding at $200.
2. The bids increase by $50 each time.
3. There are 3 other people, so there are 4 bids (including Carmen's) after which she wins.

So, the progression of bids is as follows:

- First bid: $200 (Carmen's initial bid)
- Second bid: $200 + $50 = $250 (another person's bid)
- Third bid: $250 + $50 = $300 (Carmen's second bid)
- Four bid: $300 + $50 = $350 (another person's bid)
- Fifth and final bid: $350 + $50 = $400 (Carmen's winning bid)

Now, to find the total amount Carmen spent, we add up all her bids:

- Initial bid: $200
- Second bid: $300
- Winning bid: $400

The total amount Carmen spent is $200 + $300 + $400 = $900.

\boxed{900}</s>","3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a year. He goes to work 5 days a week, 50 weeks a year, and his work is 30 miles away. Since he has to go there and back each day, he drives 60 miles a day (30 miles each way * 2 = 60 miles). So, in a week, he drives 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. Over 50 weeks, he drives 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

2. Next, we calculate the cost of the miles driven. He gets charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven in a year is 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000/year.

3. Now, let's calculate the bonus he gives to his driver. He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so his total bonus for a year is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

4. Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the driver's bonus to find out how much John pays a year for driving. So, the total cost is $30,000/year (mileage cost) + $1,800/year (bonus) = $31,800/year.

So, the final answer is that John pays $31,800 a year for driving.</s>","He has to travel 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 miles per day

                    A simple folding newspaper or tabloid can be made by folding a piece of ; paper vertically and unfolding. Then, say, page 1 is printed ; on the left back, page 2 is printed on the left front, and . then, perhaps page 32 is printed on ! the right back, ; and page 31 is printed on the right front. How many pieces of paper would be used ; in a 32-page tabloid?
                [/INST] {The final answer is} 16 pieces of paper.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. We start with a single piece of paper.

2. When we fold it vertically, it becomes two pages (one on the left side and one on the right side, with the fold in the middle).

3. To create a 32-page tabloid, we need to fold the paper 5 times (since 2^5 = 32).

4. With each fold, we double the number of pages, but we also double the number of pieces of paper used.

5. After the first fold, we've used 2 pieces of paper.

6. After the second fold, we've used 4 pieces of paper.

7. After the third fold, we've used 8 pieces of paper.

8. After the fourth fold, we've used 16 pieces of paper.

9. After the fifth fold, we've used 16 pieces of paper in total, which gives us 32 pages (16 pairs of pages, each pair being one page on the left and one on the right of the fold).

So, \boxed{16} pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid.</s>","Each piece prints 4 pages.
Then 32/4=<<32/4=8>>8 pieces of paper would be used.

What's the total amount ! of money she earned in the second year?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Elise sells each book for $20.
2. In the second year, she sold twice as many books as she did in the current year. Since she sold 45 books in the current year, she must have sold 90 books in the second year.
3. The total number of books sold over the three years is the sum of the books sold in each year plus the unsold books. So, if we add the 45 books sold in the current year, the 90 books sold in the second year, and the 50 books unsold, we get a total of 185 books.

Now, to find the total amount of money she earned in the second year, we need to calculate the total earnings from the books sold in the second year:

Total earnings in the second year = Number of books sold in the second year * Price per book
                                   = 90 books * $20/book
                                   = $1800

So, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \boxed{1800}.</s>","If her sales in the current year are 45, she sold 45*2 = <<45*2=90>>90 books in the first year.
The total number of books sold in the first and current year is 90+45 = <<90+45=135>>135.
The total number of books sold in the second year is 250 of the original number of books - 135 sold books - 50 unsold books = <<250-135-50=65>>65 books.
If each book sells at 20$, then she earned 20*65 = $<<20*65=1300>>1300 in the second year

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week. So, first, let's calculate how many hours he works in a week:
   10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

2. He earns $10 per hour. So, let's calculate his weekly earnings from his hourly wage:
   $10/hour * 50 hours/week = $500/week

3. He gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Adding this to his weekly earnings:
   $500/week + $300/week = $800/week

4. Now, let's calculate how many weeks are in April. April has 30 days, and since a week is 7 days, that's approximately:
   30 days / 7 days/week ≈ 4.29 weeks
   Since we can't have a fraction of a week in this context, we'll round down to 4 weeks.

5. Finally, let's calculate his earnings for April:
   $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

So, the final answer is:
{The final answer is $3200}</s>","In a day, Watson makes 10 * 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100
If he works five days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 5 * 4= <<5*4=20>>20 days.
Since he makes $100 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 20 * 100= $<<20*100=2000>>2000.
He also got a 300 * 4 = $<<300*4=1200>>1200 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of April.
At the end of April, he earned 2000 +1200 = $<<2000+1200=3200>>3200.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to understand that if John beats 80% of the people he arm wrestles, it means he loses to 20% of them.
2. To find out how many people he lost to, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of people he arm wrestled, which is 20.
3. We do this by multiplying the total number of people by 20% (or 0.20 in decimal form).

So, the calculation is:
20 (total people) * 0.20 (20% in decimal form) = 4

Therefore, John lost to 4 people {The final answer is 4}.</s>","He beats 20*.8=<<20*.8=16>>16 people

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of these loaves are sold in the morning. So, the loaves sold in the morning = (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.
3. This means 60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left from the morning sales.
4. Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the loaves sold in the afternoon = (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in a single week, Joey loses 8 / 4 = 2 pounds.

Step 2: Determine how much weight Sandy needs to lose in one week to lose the same amount of weight in 4 weeks.
Since Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does but needs 4 weeks to do so, Sandy needs to lose 2 pounds per week (the same amount Joey loses in a single week).

Step 3: Determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

After fifteen days, ! how many new limbs will Helena’s serum : cause a person to grow if they ! drink it?
                [/INST] First, let's understand the pattern of growth:
1. After three days, a person will grow one extra arm.
2. After five days, a person will grow one extra leg.

To find out how many new limbs will be grown after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many cycles of growth (three days for arms and five days for legs) can be completed within fifteen days:

15 days ÷ 3 days/cycle (for arms) = 5 cycles
15 days ÷ 5 days/cycle (for legs) = 3 cycles

Since a cycle is counted every time the person grows an arm and a leg, whichever cycle count is higher will determine the final count. In this case, it's the arm cycle count, so we have 5 cycles.

Therefore, during these 5 cycles:

1. The person will grow 5 extra arms (since there is one arm growth per cycle).
2. The person will grow 5 extra legs (since there is one leg growth per cycle).

Finally, to find the total number of new limbs grown, add the number of extra arms and legs: 5 (arms) + 5 (legs) = 10 new limbs.

{The final answer is 10 new limbs}</s>","At one new arm every 3 days, after 15 days, a person who drank Helena’s serum would grow 15 / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 extra arms.
At one new leg every 5 days, after 15 days, the person would grow 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 extra legs.
In all, someone who drank Helena’s serum would grow 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 new limbs after 15 days.

6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the suitcases. He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so the total cost for the suitcases is:

3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, let's find out the cost of the flight ticket. The ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times the cost would be:

5 * $100 = $500

So, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total amount Theo has spent so far:

$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for this trip, so the total amount he has for the trip is:

$6000 (total budget) - $1950 (spent) - $2000 (saved) = $2050

However, Theo has already spent $1950, so the amount left for gifts is:

4. In total, the family consumes 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

5. To find out how many eggs they consume in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

Step 1: Six years ago, Cera was younger than she is now. She is now 46 years old, so six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. So, C = 40.

Step 2: Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, N - 6 = 0.5 * C. Since C = 40, N - 6 = 0.5 * 40 = 20. Therefore, N = 20 + 6 = 26. So, now Noah is 26 years old.

Step 3: Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age. So, the population P six years ago was P = 3000 * (N - 6). Since N = 26, P = 3000 * (26 - 6) = 3000 * 20 = 60000.

Step 4: The population of Chile has doubled every six years for the last sixty years. Since Noah and Cera are both alive now, it means that we are looking at a time period of sixty years. In sixty years, the population doubles three times (since 60 / 6 = 10, and 10 is an even number). So, the population now is 60000 * 2^3 = 60000 * 8 = 480000.

                    : A football team has ! 105 members.  There are twice as many players on the offense as ! there is on the defense. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.  ; How many players are on the defense?
                [/INST] Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is 2D. The problem also states that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is 0.5D.

Now, we know that the total number of players on the team is 105. So we can set up the following equation:

D + 2D + 0.5D = 105

Combining like terms, we get 3.5D = 105.

Now, to find the number of players on the defense, we need to solve for D. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.5:

D = 105 / 3.5

D = 30

So, the final answer is:

{The final answer is 30 players on the defense.}</s>","Let x represent the number of players on the defense

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited to her party.

Number of people from 2 families with 6 people = 2 * 6 = 12 people
Number of people from 3 families with 4 people = 3 * 4 = 12 people

Total invitation = 12 + 12 = 24 people

Next, let's calculate the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and their commitments.

Number of people who couldn't come due to illness = 8 people
Number of people with previous commitments = 1/4 * 8 = 2 people

Total people who won't be able to attend due to illness/commitments = 8 + 2 = 10 people

Finally, let's calculate the number of people who will attend Martha's party.

Total people to attend = Total invitation - Total people who won't be able to attend = 24 - 10 = 14 people

{The final answer is: 14 people show up for Martha's party}</s>","First find the total number of people from 6-person families: 2 families * 6 people/family = <<2*6=12>>12 people

Add those two numbers to find the total number of people Martha invited: 12 people + 12 people = <<12+12=24>>24 people
Then find the number of people who couldn't come because they were sick: 8 people / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 people

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.

2. Solomon added these to a store that already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store now is 20 + 50 = 70 marbles.

3. Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. So, the number of marbles given by his father is (2/5) * 20 = 8 marbles.

4. Now, let's add the marbles his father gave him to the total number of marbles in the store. This gives us 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

5. Each marble weighs 2kg. So, the total weight of the marbles is 78 * 2 = 156kg.

Therefore, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is {156kg}.</s>","After buying twenty marbles from his friend Johanna, Solomon had 20+50 = <<20+50=70>>70 marbles.

In this case, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the height (or depth) is 5 feet. So, the volume of the pool is 6 feet * 4 feet * 5 feet = 120 cubic feet.

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. So, the total cost is the volume of the pool multiplied by the cost per cubic foot. That is, the cost is 120 cubic feet * $.1/cubic foot = $12.

So, the final answer is that it costs $12 to fill the pool. {The final answer is $12}.</s>","The pool has a base of 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24 square feet

1. The classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys. Since there are 30 boys, there are 3 * 30 = 90 girls.

2. The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. Since there are 30 boys, there are 30 / 10 = 3 nongendered children.

3. To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together. That is, 90 (girls) + 30 (boys) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123.

The final answer is {123 children}.</s>","The classroom has 3 * 30 boys = <<3*30=90>>90 girls.

1. Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

2. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 people.

3. This means that 10 people left the party.

4. Since 22 men stayed at the party, it means that 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party.

5. Therefore, the remaining people that left the party must be women. Since 3 men left, the remaining people that left are 10 - 3 = 7 women.

So, the final answer is that 7 women are left at the party.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. First, find out how many pencils Jam has:
   Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils which give a total of 26 pencils.

2. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as x.
   So, 3x + 2 = 26 (since there are 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils)

3. Solve for x:
   3x = 26 - 2
   3x = 24
   x = 24 / 3
   x = 8
   So, Jam has 8 pencils in each box.

4. Now, find out the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have:
   Jam has 3 boxes * 8 pencils/box + 2 loose pencils = 24 + 2 = 26 pencils.
   Meg has 46 pencils.
   Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

5. Now, find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils:

Any added liquid also , weakens the coffee. How many milliliters weaker is Shannon’s iced coffee when , it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds , 15 milliliters , of cream?
                [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the variables involved.
Shannon's iced coffee becomes weaker as she adds ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. She wants to know how much weaker her coffee will be when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream.

Step 2: Calculate how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
To find the number of ice cubes needed, we divide the total temperature difference by the temperature difference each ice cube causes:
Number of ice cubes = Total temperature difference / Temperature difference per ice cube
= 65 degrees / 13 degrees
≈ 5 ice cubes

Step 3: Calculate how much weaker the coffee becomes due to the ice cubes.
Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so for 5 ice cubes:
Weaker due to ice cubes = Number of ice cubes * Weakness per ice cube
= 5 * 12 milliliters
= 60 milliliters

Step 4: Adjust the coffee's volume due to the added cream.
Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream to the coffee. Since the coffee becomes weaker when liquid is added, we need to subtract this amount from the coffee's volume.
Adjusted coffee volume = Coffee volume - Cream volume
= 60 milliliters (total initial coffee volume) - 15 milliliters (cream)
= 45 milliliters

Step 5: Calculate the relative weakness of the adjusted coffee volume.
Since the coffee becomes weaker as its volume increases, we need to find the ratio of the adjusted coffee volume to the total initial coffee volume:
Relative weakness = Adjusted coffee volume / Total initial coffee volume
= 45 milliliters / 60 milliliters
= 3/4

Step 6: Convert the relative weakness to a percentage to find the final answer.
Percentage = Relative weakness * 100%
= (3/4) * 100%
= 75%

So, Shannon's iced coffee is 25% (since 100% - 75% = 25%) weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream.

{The final answer is} \boxed{25}</s>","Shannon’s iced coffee has 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes in it.

1. First, we need to find the number of junior programmers. We know that they make up 2/5 of the total employees, and the total number of employees is 100. So, the number of junior programmers is (2/5)*100 = 40.

2. Next, we calculate the monthly salary of a junior programmer. It's given as $2000.

3. Now, let's find the monthly salary of a senior programmer. We know that they are paid $400 more than junior programmers. So, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

4. The total number of senior programmers would be the total number of programmers minus the number of junior programmers. So, there are 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

5. Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all senior programmers. It would be 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

6. Similarly, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all junior programmers. It would be 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

7. Finally, to find the total amount of money the company pays to all programmers, we add the total amount paid to both junior and senior programmers. So, the total amount is $144,000 + $80,000 = $224,000.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so we subtract 2 from the total: 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
3. He gives 14 out to his friends, so we subtract 14 from the total: 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends, so we multiply the number he gave by 2 and add it to his current total: 8 * 2 + 8 = 24 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so we subtract 3 from the total: 24 - 3 = 21 lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so we subtract 2 from the total: 21 - 2 = 19 lollipops.

Therefore, Oscar ends up with 19 lollipops.

The final answer is {19 lollipops}.</s>","He has 24 lollipops, eats 2 and passes 14 out to his friends so that’s 24-2-14 = <<24-2-14=8>>8 lollipops are left

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. The phone is currently at 60% capacity, meaning it has 40% more to charge.
2. The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point every 3 minutes.
3. To find out how long it will take to charge the remaining 40%, we multiply the time it takes to charge one percentage point by 40.
4. So, 3 minutes * 40 = 120 minutes.
5. To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?
                [/INST] First, let's calculate Nick's after-tax income for Job A:

1. Calculate gross income for Job A:
   $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000

2. Calculate net income for Job A after a 20% tax rate:
   $30,000 * (1 - 0.2) = $24,000

Now, let's calculate Nick's after-tax income for Job B:

1. Calculate gross income for Job B:
   We don't have information about hourly wage, but we know annual gross income is $42,000.

2. Deduct property tax from gross income:
   $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

3. Calculate net income for Job B after a 10% tax rate:
   $36,000 * (1 - 0.1) = $32,400

Finally, compare the net incomes of both jobs to determine which job Nick makes more money:

Since $32,400 > $24,000, Nick makes more money with Job B.

Now let's find the difference between the two net incomes:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

So, Nick makes $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A.

{The final answer is: \boxed{8,400}}</s>","First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000
Next, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000
Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400
Now subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total cost of Furniture United's offer.
The total cost of Furniture United's offer is the sum of the advance payment and the total of the monthly installments. The total of the monthly installments is the installment amount multiplied by the number of installments. So, the total cost of Furniture United's offer is $1,350 + ($350 * 6).

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer.
The total cost of Cozy Homes' offer is the sum of the advance payment and the total of the monthly installments. The total of the monthly installments is the installment amount multiplied by the number of installments. So, the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer is $1,100 + ($250 * 9).

Step 3: Calculate the cost difference between the two offers.
The cost difference is the difference between the total cost of Furniture United's offer and the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer. So, the cost difference is ($1,350 + ($350 * 6)) - ($1,100 + ($250 * 9)).

Final Step: Calculate the cost difference.
The cost difference is ($1,350 + $2,100) - ($1,100 + $2,250) = $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

1. Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar to make a batch of suckers. Therefore, to make 8 batches of suckers, he will need:
   Sugar for suckers = Sugars per batch * Batches
   = 30 ounces * 8
   = 240 ounces

2. Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar to make a batch of fudge. Since he needs to make 1 batch of fudge, he will need:
   Sugar for fudge = Sugars per batch * Batches
   = 70 ounces * 1
   = 70 ounces

3. To find out the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we add the sugar required for suckers and fudge:
   Total sugar needed = Sugar for suckers + Sugar for fudge

Total cost = Number of shares * Costper share
                 = 8 * $8
                 = $64

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%:

New price = Old price * (1 + Percentage increase)
                 = $8 * (1 + 0.50)
                 = $8 * 1.5
                 = $12

So, the total value of 8 shares after the first year is:

Total value after first year = Number of shares * New price
                                        = 8 * $12
                                        = $96

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%:

New price = Old price * (1 - Percentage decrease)
                 = $12 * (1 - 0.25)
                 = $12 * 0.75
                 = $9

However, since Maria is still holding the shares and the number of shares hasn't changed, the total value after the second year is still based on the new price per share:

Total value after second year = Number of shares * New price
                                          = 8 * $9

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem:

1. The class of 200 students is split into 3 groups.
2. Two of these groups have an equal number of students. Let's call this number ""x"".
3. The smallest group has 10 less students than each of the other groups. So, the number of students in this group is ""x - 10"".

The equation to represent this scenario would be:

x (number of students in the two larger groups) + x (number of students in the other larger group, since they're equal) + x - 10 (number of students in the smallest group) = 200 (total number of students)

This simplifies to 3x - 10 = 200.

4. Solving for x, we add 10 to both sides of the equation to get 3x = 210.
5. Then, we divide both sides by 3 to get x = 70.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total.

2. He has twice as many chickens as cows.
   Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as H (for chickens, as we like to call them for simplicity). According to the problem, we have the equation: H = 2C.

3. The total number of animals is 60, so we have another equation: H + C = 60.

4. Now, we can use the first equation to substitute H in the second equation. So, 2C + C = 60 becomes 3C = 60.

5. Solving for C, we get C = 60 / 3 = 20. So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows.

6. Now, we can find out how many chickens he has. Using the first equation, H = 2 * 20 = 40. So, he has 40 chickens.

                [/INST] Step 1: Identify the weights of each animal based on the given information.
- A pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
- A blue beetle weighs the same as a pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- A green toad weighs the same as a pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- A yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than a pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- A red bird weighs 20 pounds less than a pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Step 2: Add the weight of each animal together to find the total weight of the animals.
Total weight of animals = weight of pink frog + weight of blue beetle + weight of green toad + weight of yellow snake + weight of red bird
Total weight of animals = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

Step 3: Add the weight of the container to the total weight of the animals to find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal.
Total weight = total weight of animals + weight of container
Total weight = 240 + 20 = 260 pounds

The final answer is:

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters. To find out how much more that is, we calculate 1/5 of 5000.

More meters = 5000 * (1/5)

2. Now, we add this to the original distance Tyson runs to find out the new daily distance.

New daily distance = Original distance + More meters

3. To find the total distance covered in a month (June), we multiply the new daily distance by the number of days in June (30 days).

Total distance in June = New daily distance * 30

Let's calculate:

More meters = 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 meters

New daily distance = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters

Total distance in June = 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters

So, the final answer is:

   - Number of tractors sold per day: 10

   - Total daily earnings from tractors: $10 \times 100 = \$1000$

   - The original daily earnings (from tractors): $\$1000$

The increase is $\$100$, and this is relative to the original daily earnings of $\$1000$. To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Original Amount}}\right) \times 100\% \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{\$100}{\$1000}\right) \times 100\% = 0.1 \times 100\% = 10\% \]

                    question:
                    John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched : 3 , different shows ; which were 2 hours each.  This was 30% of ? the time he spent.  He spent , 40% of his time sightseeing.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Boating and Swimming Time**: John spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. So, the time he spends swimming is 6/2 = 3 hours.

2. **Watching Shows**: He watches 3 different shows, each 2 hours long. So, the total time he spends watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

3. **Total Time for Boating, Swimming, and Watching Shows**: Adding up the time spent on these activities gives us 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

4. **Percentage of Time for Watching Shows**: These 15 hours are said to be 30% of the total time he spent on his vacation.

5. **Total Vacation Time**: To find out the total time he spent on his vacation, we can set up the equation 30% * Total Time = 15 hours. Solving for the Total Time gives us Total Time = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

6. **Time Spent Sightseeing**: John spends 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time he spends sightseeing is 40% * 50 hours = 20 hours.

Therefore, John spends 20 hours sightseeing. {The final answer is 20 hours}.</s>","He spent 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours swimming
He spent 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 hours watching shows
So he spent 6+3+6=<<6+3+6=15>>15 hours on these activities
That means he spent 15/.3=<<15/.3=50>>50 hours on activities
So he spent 50*.4=<<50*.4=20>>20 hours sightseeing

                [/INST] Annabelle needs to save $400 for the phone. She already has $80 in her savings. First, let's calculate how much Annabelle earns from her first job.

1. Annabelle earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours. So, she earns:
   Earnings from first job = Hourly wage * Hours worked
   Earnings from first job = $10/hour * 20 hours
   Earnings from first job = $200

Next, let's calculate how much Annabelle earns from her second job.

2. Annabelle earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours. So, she earns:
   Earnings from second job = Hourly wage * Hours worked
   Earnings from second job = $5/hour * 15 hours
   Earnings from second job = $75

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from both jobs and add it to her existing savings.

3. Total earnings = Earnings from first job + Earnings from second job + Existing savings
   Total earnings = $200 + $75 + $80
   Total earnings = $355

Finally, let's calculate how much more money Annabelle still needs to save to buy the phone.

4. Money still needed = Total cost of phone - Total earnings
   Money still needed = $400 - $355
   Money still needed = $45

So, Annabelle still needs to save $45 to buy the phone.

{The final answer is $45}</s>","Subtracting Annabelle’s initial savings shows that she still needs to save $400 – $80 = $<<400-80=320>>320.
From her first job, she earns $10 * 20 hours = $<<10*20=200>>200.
From her second job, she earns $5 * 15 hours = $<<5*15=75>>75.
She therefore still needs to save $320 – $200 – $75 = $<<320-200-75=45>>45.

                [/INST] Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.
2. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree. So, its height is 6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet.
3. The tallest tree's height is twice the combined heights of the two shorter trees. So, first, let's add the heights of the two shorter trees: 6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet.
4. Now, the height of the tallest tree would be twice this total: 17 feet * 2 = 34 feet.

Therefore, the tallest tree is {34 feet} tall.</s>","The height of the second tree is 6 + 5 = <<6+5=11>>11 feet.

The cost of 6 toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The cost of 5 teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
So, the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears is $12 + $5 = $17.

Step 2: Add the extra money given by Dean's mother.
Dean initially had $28, and his mother gave him an extra $10.
So, Dean has $28 + $10 = $38 now.

Step 3: Calculate how much money Dean has left after buying the toys.
Dean spent $17 on toys and had $38 before buying the toys.
So, Dean has $38 - $17 = $21 left.

The answer is: \boxed{21}.</s>","The cost of the toy cars is 6 cars × $2/car = $<<6*2=12>>12.

The Go-karts cost . $10 a ride. How many friends : can she invite?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total cost of Morgan's birthday party for her friends. This includes the cost of mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-kart rides.

1. The cost of a round of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 each, so for all of them, it would be $5 * number_of_friends.

2. The cost of arcade tokens for Morgan and her friends is $5 each, so for all of them, it would be $5 * number_of_friends.

3. The cost of go-kart rides for Morgan and her friends is $10 each for two rides, so for all of them, it would be $10 * 2 * number_of_friends.

The total cost for one person would be the sum of these three costs: 5 + 5 + 10 * 2 = $25 + 5 * number_of_friends.

Since Morgan has a $90 budget, we can set up the equation: $90 = $25 + 5 * number_of_friends.

Solving this equation for number_of_friends, we get:

number_of_friends = ($90 - $25) / 5 = $65 / 5 = \boxed{13}.

So, Morgan can invite 13 friends to her birthday party.</s>","The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into clear, step-by-step calculations:

1. **Calculate the total amount Marisa spends on lollipops each day:**
   - The cost of one lollipop is $0.25.
   - She buys 4 lollipops each day.
   - Therefore, the total amount spent on lollipops each day is $0.25 \times 4 = \$1.00$.

2. **Calculate the amount Marisa saves each day:**
   - Marisa earns $5 every day.
   - After spending $1.00 on lollipops, she saves the difference.
   - Therefore, the amount she saves each day is $5.00 - \$1.00 = \$4.00$.

3. **Calculate the total amount saved over 5 days:**
   - She saves $4.00 each day.
   - Over 5 days, the total amount saved is $4.00 \times 5 = \$20.00$.

Therefore, Marisa puts $\boxed{\$20.00}$ in her piggy bank after saving for 5 days.</s>","If each lollipop costs 25 cents, 4 lollipops cost 4 * 25 cents = <<4*25=100>>100 cents

                [/INST] First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05, so he spent:
40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2

This means he took half his change from buying candy and spent it on gumballs. Therefore, he spent $2 from his change, and since he received the change from buying candy, he must have spent $2 on candy before buying gumballs.

Since he spent $2 on candy and the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can determine how many pounds of candy he bought:
$2 / $1.5/pound = 1.33 pounds

However, since he can't buy a fraction of a pound of candy, we'll round down to the nearest whole pound. So, Billy bought 1 pound of candy.

{The final answer is \boxed{1}}</s>","He spent $2 on gumballs because 40 x .05 = <<40*.05=2>>2

Step 1: According to the problem, Carver is 5 years older than twice his son's age. This can be written as:
C = 2S + 5

Step 2: We also know that Carver is 45 years old, so:
45 = 2S + 5

Step 3: Now, we can solve for S by subtracting 5 from both sides and then dividing by 2:
45 - 5 = 2S
40 = 2S
S = 40 / 2
S = 20

So, Carver's son is 20 years old.

{The final answer is \boxed{20}}</s>","Let x be the age of Carver's son.
Since Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, then 45=(2*x)-5.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the previous two trips, which is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

So, the train travels a total of 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles in one trip between the cities.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, it travels a total of 300 * 3 = 900 miles a day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total miles it can travel before needing service by the miles it travels in a day:

18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = \boxed{20} days.</s>","It takes 100+75=<<100+75=175>>175 miles for the first two legs of the trip

1. First, calculate the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. Since it takes the average amount of stuffing between the first two kinds of beds (8 pounds for a Rottweiler bed and 2 pounds for a chihuahua bed), we can find the average by adding the amounts together and dividing by 2. So, (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds of stuffing for a collie bed.

2. Next, calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. Multiply the amount of stuffing needed for one chihuahua bed (2 pounds) by 4, and the amount of stuffing needed for one collie bed (5 pounds) by 3. So, 2 * 4 + 5 * 3 = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we need to calculate the time it took him to drive to his friend's house. The time can be calculated using the formula Time = Distance / Speed. So, the time it took him to drive to his friend's house is (210 miles) / (70 mph) = 3 hours.

After reaching his friend's house, John takes a route home that is 240 miles, but he drives at 80 mph. So, the time it took him to drive home is (240 miles) / (80 mph) = 3 hours.

Finally, we add the time it took him to drive to his friend's house and the time it took him to drive home to get the total time for the trip. So, the total time for the trip is (3 hours + 3 hours) = 6 hours.

2. We are also told that there are twice '?' the number of boys in the park.

3. To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to add the number of girls and the number of boys.

4. Since the number of boys is twice the number represented by '?', we can express the number of boys as 2 * '?'.

5. Now, we can write an equation for the total number of kids in the park: Total kids = Number of girls + Number of boys = 6 + 2 * '?'

6. However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of '?'.

So, even though we have expressed the total number of kids in terms of '?', we cannot provide a numerical answer without more information. {The final answer is: Total kids = 6 + 2 * '?'}</s>","There are 6 girls x 2 boys/girl = <<6*2=12>>12 boys in the park.

2. The number of shoplifters is four times that number minus 5. So, the number of shoplifters = 4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. So, the number of people involved in violence = 3 * 7 = 21.

4. The total number of people kicked out from Walmart is 50.

5. We have already counted the number of people who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence. Therefore, the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons is the total number minus the sum of the three categories we have counted: 50 - 3 (mask-less) - 7 (shoplifters) - 21 (violence) = 19.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

1. First, we understand that Erin now has three times more points than Sara. This means if we denote Erin's points as E and Sara's points as S, then E = 3S.

2. We know that Sara scored 8 points, so S = 8.

3. Substitute S into the first equation, we get E = 3*8 = 24. This means Erin now has 24 points.

4. Now, if we know that Erin scored 14 points more than she had before, we can denote her initial points as 'x'. So, Erin's current points (24) is equal to her initial points (x) plus 14.

5. Therefore, 24 = x + 14. Solving for x, we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation, x = 24 - 14 = 10.

How much ? will be spent on the senior gifts?
                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of officers among the seniors.
The number of officers is 1/4 of the total number of seniors, which is 44. So, the number of officers is 44/4 = 11.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the picture frames for all seniors.
Each picture frame costs $20 and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44*$20 = $880.

Step 3: Calculate the additional cost of etching the logo on each picture frame.
The logo etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of each picture frame, which is $20. So, the additional cost is 20/100 * $20 = $4. The total additional cost for all 44 picture frames is 44*$4 = $176.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the picture frames including the additional cost of etching the logo.
The total cost is the cost of the picture frames plus the additional cost of etching the logo, which is $880 + $176 = $1056.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the pins for the two seniors who will receive them.
Each pin costs $5 and there are 2 pins. So, the total cost of the pins is 2*$5 = $10.

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the cords for the 11 officers.
Each cord costs $12 and there are 11 officers. So, the total cost of the cords is 11*$12 = $132.

Step 7: Calculate the total cost of all the senior gifts.
The total cost is the cost of the picture frames, the pins, and the cords, which is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

1. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. On Saturday, they sold double the number sold on Friday, which is 14 * 2 = 28 pairs of tennis shoes.
3. On Sunday, they sold half the amount sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
4. Six people returned their pairs of shoes because they didn't fit. So, we need to subtract these from the total sales.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shoes sold by the end of the sale:

Total shoes sold = Shoes sold on Friday + Shoes sold on Saturday + Shoes sold on Sunday - Shoes returned
Total shoes sold = 14 + 28 + 14 - 6
Total shoes sold = 56 - 6

First, we know she had a 1-hour practice on Tuesdays.

Then, she had a 2-hour practice on Thursdays.

On Saturdays, her dance practice was twice as long as her Tuesday's night class, which was 1 hour. So, her Saturday practice was 2 * 1 = \boxed{2} hours.

Now, we add up all these hours to find her total weekly dance practice:

Total weekly dance practice = Tuesday's practice + Thursday's practice + Saturday's practice

If they returned the faulty pieces of equipment to . the ! seller, calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment.
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment bought. However, the value of each piece isn't provided, so we can't calculate the total number of pieces. But since we're only asked for the amount of money spent on functioning pieces, we don't actually need to know the total number of pieces.

2. Next, we need to determine the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. These represent 40% of the total value of $400000. To find this amount, we calculate 40% of $400000:
   Faulty value = (Percentage / 100) * Total value
   Faulty value = (40 / 100) * $400000
   Faulty value = 0.4 * $400000
   Faulty value = $160000

3. Finally, to find the value of the functioning pieces of equipment, we subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total value:
   Functioning value = Total value - Faulty value
   Functioning value = $400000 - $160000
   Functioning value = $240000

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240000. {The final answer is $240000}.</s>","If 40% worth of the pieces of equipment bought were faulty and were returned, the amount of money they were bought for is 40/100*$400000 = $<<40/100*400000=160000>>160000
Since the faulty pieces of equipment were worth $400000, the functioning equipment was worth $400000-$160000 = $<<400000-160000=240000>>240000

1. First, we need to determine how many sheep contribute 1 kg of milk and how many contribute 2 kg. Since Mary gets milk from half of her sheep for 1 kg and the other half for 2 kg, we need to divide the total number of sheep, 30, by 2. So, 30/2 = 15. This means Mary gets 1 kg of milk from 15 sheep and 2 kg from the other 15 sheep.

2. Next, we calculate the total amount of milk Mary gets from the first half of her sheep. This is 1 kg per sheep * 15 sheep = 15 kg.

3. Then, we calculate the total amount of milk Mary gets from the second half of her sheep. This is 2 kg per sheep * 15 sheep = 30 kg.

4. Finally, we add the milk from both halves to find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day. This is 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

                [/INST] To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, first we need to calculate the total amount she has to repay after five months. Since she has to pay an equal amount every month, the total amount she has to repay will be the sum of the monthly payments.

Let's denote the monthly payment by 'P'.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount she has to repay.
Since she has to repay the borrowed amount and additionally pay the interest for five months, we can write the total amount as:

Total amount = Borrowed amount + (Interest rate * Borrowed amount)

Given: Borrowed amount = $3,650
Interest rate = 10% = 0.10

Total amount = $3,650 + (0.10 * $3,650)
Total amount = $3,650 + $365
Total amount = $3,650 + $365
Total amount = $4,015

Step 2: Calculate the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months

Monthly payment = $4,015 / 5
Monthly payment = $803

{The final answer is: \boxed{\text{803}}}</s>","Karan's interest is $3,650 × 0.1 = $<<3650*0.1=365>>365.
In total Karan has to pay $3650 + $365 = $<<3650+365=4015>>4015.

1. First, we need to calculate the distance Cho hiked. To do this, we multiply his speed by the time he hiked.
   Distance_Cho = Speed_Cho * Time_Cho
   = 14 km/hour * 8 hours
   = 112 kilometers

2. Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked. We do this in the same way:
   Distance_Chloe = Speed_Chloe * Time_Chloe
   = 9 km/hour * 5 hours
   = 45 kilometers

3. Finally, to find out how much farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:
   Difference = Distance_Cho - Distance_Chloe

                [/INST] Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Axel has 50 silver pesos, and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means Anna has 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos.

2. Axel has 80 gold pesos, and Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

3. To find the total number of pesos they have together, we add the silver and gold pesos they each have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos + 80 gold pesos = 130 pesos.
Anna has 100 silver pesos + 120 gold pesos = 220 pesos.

Together, Axel and Anna have 130 pesos + 220 pesos = 350 pesos.

If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how , much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the ! lemonade stand?
                [/INST] To calculate the profit Millie will make per hour from her lemonade stand, we need to go through these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cups Millie can make:**
   Millie can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups she can make is:
   \[
   3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue Millie makes from selling all the lemonade:**
   Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 36 cups of lemonade is:
   \[
   36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of making the lemonade:**
   The cost to make the lemonade is given as $18.

4. **Calculate the profit per hour:**
   Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. Therefore, the profit per hour is the total revenue from selling 36 cups minus the cost, divided by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. The number of hours to sell all the lemonade is:
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Therefore, the profit per hour is:
   \[
   \frac{\$36 - \$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2/\text{hour}
   \]

The final answer is that Millie will make a profit of $\boxed{\$2}$ per hour running her lemonade stand.</s>","She has enough supplies to make 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 cups of lemonade.
She sells all of the lemonade for 36 * $1 = $<<36*1=36>>36.

                    Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 ! of his land ; and had 12.8 hectares left. How much land did he have at first?
                [/INST] To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation where the initial amount of land is represented by ""x"". According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 (or 60%) of his land, which means he was left with 12.8 hectares. This can be represented as:

x - (3/5)x = 12.8

Now, let's solve for x step by step:

1. Simplify the left side of the equation:

x - (3/5)x = (2/5)x

2. Divide both sides of the equation by (2/5) to isolate x:

((2/5)x) / (2/5) = 12.8 / (2/5)

3. Multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (2/5), which is (5/2):

x = 12.8 * (5/2)

4. Multiply the numbers on the right side:

x = 32

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.}</s>","Mr. Ruther is left with 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.
Since 2/5 is equal to 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 is equal to 12.8/2 = <<12.8/2=6.4>>6.4 hectares.
Hence, Mr. Ruther had 6.4 x 5 = <<6.4*5=32>>32 hectares of land at first.

Since it is stated that the choir has 52 members and 50% of the members are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as $52/2 = 26$ boys. Therefore, there are also 26 girls in the choir because the rest of the members are girls.

2. The choir plans to perform with just its female members. Since there are 26 girls in the choir, we might initially think that 26 people will be singing in the performance.

3. However, the performance is affected by an unexpected event. Half of the people performing cannot make it to the show because their bus breaks down. This means that only half of the planned performers will actually sing.

4. To find out how many people will actually sing, we need to calculate half of the original number of girls who were planned to perform. Since there are 26 girls, half of this number is $26/2 = 13$ girls.

5. The situation changes when the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. This increases the number of people singing in the performance by 3.

6. Finally, to find the total number of people who sang in the performance, we add the number of girls who could perform to the number of teachers who decided to sing: $13 + 3 = 16$.

Therefore, the final number of people who sang in the performance is $\boxed{16}$.</s>","The 50 person choir is 50% female, so if the performance is just women there will be 52/2=26 people performing.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, meaning for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. To find out how many popsicles each person has, we need to find the common multiple of 5 and 6 in the ratio that equals the total number of popsicles, which is 165.

We can find the common multiple in the ratio that equals 165 by dividing 165 by the sum of the ratio (5+6=11) and then multiplying the result by 5 (for Betty's popsicles) or 6 (for Sam's popsicles).

165 divided by 11 equals 15.
Multiply 15 by 5 to find the number of popsicles Betty has: 15 * 5 = 75.
Multiply 15 by 6 to find the number of popsicles Sam has: 15 * 6 = 90.

Now, to find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total cost of Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus with the given discount:

Netflix cost = $10
Hulu and Disney Plus cost each = $10

Discount for bundling = 20%

So, the total cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after discount = Normal cost * (1 - discount)
= $20 * (1 - 0.2)
= $20 * 0.8
= $16

Now, the total cost for Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus = Netflix cost + (Discounted Hulu and Disney Plus cost)
= $10 + $16
= $26

Therefore, the amount saved by cancelling his $60 cable package is = (Original cable cost) - (Total cost for Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus)
= $60 - $26
= $34

The final answer is \boxed{34}.</s>","Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20
By bundling he saves 20*.2=$<<20*.2=4>>4
So in total it cost 20-4=$<<20-4=16>>16
So he pays 16+10=$<<16+10=26>>26 for streaming
That means he saves 60-26=$<<60-26=34>>34 a month

                    Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes ! editing it. : What percentage of her total work time did she spend editing?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to understand that Carol spends 4 hours writing the song. We'll convert this into minutes because the other times are given in minutes. We know that 1 hour = 60 minutes, so 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.
2. Next, she spends half that time recording the song. Half of 240 minutes is 240 / 2 = 120 minutes.
3. The total time spent on writing and recording is 240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) = 360 minutes.
4. Now, we know she spends 90 minutes editing the song.
5. To find the percentage of the total work time spent on editing, we use the formula: (Time spent on editing / Total time spent) * 100%.
6. Substituting our values into the formula gives us: (90 / 360) * 100% = 25%.

So, Carol spends 25% of her total work time editing the song. {The final answer is 25%}.</s>","First find how long Carol spent writing the song in minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<4*60=240>>240 minutes
Then find how long she spent recording the song: 240 minutes / 2 = <<240/2=120>>120 minutes
Then add up all her work time to find the total work time: 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = <<240+120+90=450>>450 ​minutes
Then divide her editing time by her total work time and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 90 minutes / 450 minutes * 100% = 20%

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she gave out a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.
She received 17 cards from her family and friends.

Step 3: Calculate the final number of cards Erica has.
To get the final number of cards, we add the number of cards she received to the number of cards she had at the beginning and subtract the number of cards she gave out:

For flour:
Mark normally uses 3 cups for a single batch, so for a quadruple batch, he will need 3 cups \* 4 = 12 cups of flour.

For milk:
Mark normally uses 1 cup for a single batch, so for a quadruple batch, he will need 1 cup \* 4 = 4 cups of milk.

For flour:
Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so Mark will need 12 cups / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

For milk:
Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need 4 cups / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

Finally, we can determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark will need to buy.

1. First, we need to calculate the amount of energy used by the air conditioner every day. Since it uses 900 watts of energy per hour, and Mel uses it for 8 hours a day, the daily energy consumption is:
   Daily energy consumption = AC power * Hours used per day
   = 900 watts * 8 hours
   = 7200 watts or 7.2 kilowatts (since 1 kilowatt equals 1000 watts)

2. Next, we need to find out how much energy is saved when Mel reduces the usage time by 5 hours. The reduced energy consumption per day is:
   Reduced energy consumption = AC power * (Hours used per day - Reduction in hours)
   = 900 watts * (8 hours - 5 hours)
   = 900 watts * 3 hours
   = 2700 watts or 2.7 kilowatts

3. Now, to find out how much energy is saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saving by 30:
   Total energy saved in 30 days = Daily energy saving * Number of days
   = 2.7 kilowatts * 30 days
   = 81 kilowatts

So, the final answer is that Mel will save {81 kilowatts} of electric energy in 30 days.</s>","An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.

So, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.
That is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.
Hence, in 30 days he will have 2.7 x 30 = <<2.7*30=81>>81 kilowatts of electric energy saved.

\[ \text{Total meat} = \text{Number of sandwiches} \times \text{Meat per sandwich} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total cheese} = \text{Number of sandwiches} \times \text{Cheese per sandwich} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:
- The cost of the meat is calculated by multiplying the weight of the meat by the cost per pound:
\[ \text{Cost of meat} = \text{Total meat} \times \text{Cost per pound of meat} = 5 \times 7 = \$35 \]
- Similarly, the cost of the cheese is calculated by multiplying the weight of the cheese by the cost per pound:
\[ \text{Cost of cheese} = \text{Total cheese} \times \text{Cost per pound of cheese} = 5 \times 3 = \$15 \]

Finally, we find the total cost by adding the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of meat} + \text{Cost of cheese} = \$35 + \$15 = \$50 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people is $\boxed{\$50}$.</s>","Each sandwich serves 4 people and he had 20 people in total to make food for so 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 sandwiches
1 pound of meat cost $7.00 per sandwich and he had to make 5 so 7*5 = $<<7*5=35.00>>35.00 for meat
1 pound of cheese cost $3.00 per sandwich and he had to make 5 so 3*5 = $<<3*5=15.00>>15.00 for cheese
When you add the meat and cheese together, he would spend 35+15 = $<<35+15=50.00>>50.00

                [/INST] To think step by step through this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has a total of 40 cannolis in his house. This means he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns in his house.

2. Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. This means he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis in total.

3. Allan has 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he has now. Since he has 100 cannolis now (step 2), this means he has 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

4. The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is therefore 60 corns + 100 cannolis = \boxed{160}.</s>","Before buying any corn and cannoli, Allan had twice as much corn as cannoli, which is 40 cannoli * 2 corn/cannoli = <<40*2=80>>80 corns
The total number of corns and cannolis that Allan had before is 80 corn + 40 corn = <<80+40=120>>120 corn
When he bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, he bought 60 corn - 40 corn = <<60-40=20>>20 corns
In total, he bought 20 corns + 60 cannolis = <<20+60=80>>80 items
After the purchases, Allan has 120 items + 80 items = <<120+80=200>>200 total corns and cannolis combined.

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. Elliott wants to take 10,000 steps a day.

2. He has already walked half of his daily goal to and from school, which accounts for 10,000/2 = 5,000 steps.

3. He also walked 1,000 steps with his friend.

So far, Elliott has taken 5,000 (school walks) + 1,000 (with friend) = 6,000 steps.

4. Elliott realized after his jog that he only had 2,000 steps left to take to reach his daily goal.

This means he must have taken 10,000 (daily goal) - 2,000 (remaining steps) = 8,000 steps during his jog and other activities before the jog.

5. However, we want to find out how many steps he took during his jog specifically.

Since Elliott had already taken 6,000 steps before his jog and had 2,000 steps left after, he took 8,000 (steps taken before and after jog) - 6,000 (steps taken before jog) = 2,000 steps during his jog.

So, \boxed{2000} steps were taken during Elliott's jog.</s>","Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
   Total words = Pages * Words per page
   = 45 * 200
   = 9000 words

2. Next, we'll calculate how long it will take Toby to read the book:
   Time to read = Total words / Reading rate
   = 9000 / 300
   = 30 minutes

3. Finally, we'll calculate how many minutes early Toby will be:
   Early time = Total time before leaving - (Time to read + Time to get to the airport)

Since 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June, we need to find out 1/4 of the total employees hired in May.
Number of expired employees = Total employees in May * 1/4
Number of expired employees = 40 * 1/4 = 10

Step 2: Calculate the number of employees remaining in June.
To find the number of employees remaining in June, subtract the number of expired employees from the total employees in May.
Number of remaining employees = Total employees in May - Number of expired employees
Number of remaining employees = 40 - 10 = 30

Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid in May.
In May, there were 40 employees, each working 40 hours a week and earning $15 per hour.
Total amount paid in May = Number of employees * Hours worked per week * Hourly rate
Total amount paid in May = 40 * 40 * $15 = $24,000

Step 4: Calculate the total amount paid in June.
In June, there were 30 employees, each working 40 hours a week and earning $15 per hour.
Total amount paid in June = Number of employees * Hours worked per week * Hourly rate
Total amount paid in June = 30 * 40 * $15 = $18,000

Step 5: Calculate the total amount paid in the two months.
Total amount paid in two months = Total amount paid in May + Total amount paid in June
Total amount paid in two months = $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

{The final answer is: $42,000}</s>","When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.

Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.

2. Taffy costs $3 for 1 pound, but with the offer of ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" the second pound costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50. So, 2 pounds of taffy cost $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

3. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

4. The 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

5. In total, Sally spent $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1.00 (magnets) = $7.00.

6. Now, subtract the total amount Sally spent from the initial amount her parents gave her: $10 - $7 = $3.

We know that 2,500 candles smell like wet dog and 50,000 candles are made in total. So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is equal to the number of candles that smell like wet dog times the probability that a candle smells like wet dog and explodes, which is 1%.

1. First, let's establish the information given:
   - Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
   - Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
   - Let's assume Joanne gathers 'x' apples from the average trees.
   - Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples as Joanne from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
   - Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
   - The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500.

2. We can set up an equation to represent the total number of apples gathered by both sisters:
   - Joanne's apples + Sister's apples = Total apples
   - 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) + 60 (Joanne's sister, tallest) + 45 (Joanne's sister, shortest) = 500

3. Simplifying this equation gives us:
   - 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500
   - 150 + x = 500

4. Solving for 'x' gives us:
   - x = 500 - 150
   - x = 350

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

\boxed{350}</s>","Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.

                    question:
                    A herd consists of camels and . dromedaries. There are 180 heads and 304 bumps. How many dromedaries are there if camels , have two humps each and , dromedaries have one hump each?
                [/INST] Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

From the problem, we know two things:

1. The total number of heads (which is the total number of animals) is 180. So, we have the equation:
   C + D = 180

2. The total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each, we can write the second equation as:
   2C + D = 304

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of C and D.

First, let's isolate D in the first equation:
   D = 180 - C

Then, substitute D in the second equation:
   2C + (180 - C) = 304

Solve for C:
   C = 124

Now, substitute C back into the first equation to find D:
   D = 180 - 124

So, D = 56

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is {56}.</s>","Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance for the first 4 days is 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers.

2. Over the next two days, he traveled only 30% of the distance he did in the first four days. So, the total distance for these two days is 30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 kilometers.

3. After this, there was one day when he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for this day is 0 kilometers.

4. During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day. So, the total distance for the second week is 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers.

5. Now, let's add up all these distances to find the total distance Tom traveled during his trip: 800 km (first four days) + 240 km (next two days) + 0 km (one day of rest) + 2100 km (second week) = 3140 kilometers.

So, {The final answer is 3140 kilometers}.</s>","In the first four days, Tom made 4 * 200 = <<4*200=800>>800 kilometers.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day, which means 7 * 300 = <<7*300=2100>>2100 kilometers during the whole week.
During his whole trip, Tom made 800 + 240 + 2100 = <<800+240+2100=3140>>3140 kilometers.

How many feet must Oliver climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out the difference in elevation between Stanley's and Oliver's positions. Stanley is at 10,000 feet and Oliver is at 3,000 feet.

2. The difference in elevation is calculated by subtracting the lower elevation from the higher one. In this case, it would be 10,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 7,000 feet.

3. Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet to a ledge below. This means that the comb is now at an elevation 4,000 feet below where Stanley was standing.

4. To find out how far Oliver needs to climb to reach the comb, we compare the comb's elevation to Oliver's. Since Oliver is lower than the comb's new elevation, we can find the distance by subtracting Oliver's elevation from the comb's new elevation.

5. The comb's new elevation is 10,000 feet (Stanley's original elevation) - 4,000 feet (the distance the comb fell) = 6,000 feet.

6. So, to reach the comb, Oliver needs to climb 6,000 feet - 3,000 feet (his own elevation) = 3,000 feet.

Therefore, {Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb}.</s>","The elevation of Stanley's comb was 10,000 - 4,000 = <<10000-4000=6000>>6,000 feet.

1. Mr. Josue received $4000 from the first bank.
2. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. So, from the second bank, he received 2 * $4000 = $8000.
3. Adding the amount from the two banks, we get $4000 + $8000 = $12000.
4. He initially had $5000 in capital. Adding the capital he received from the two banks, we get $5000 + $12000 = $17000.

                [/INST] Let's solve this step by step:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came, each carrying away 5 cats. So, the number of cats carried away is 4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats.
3. After these boats took their cats, there were 50 - 20 = 30 cats left on the rock.
4. Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran away. So, the number of cats that ran away is 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.
5. After 18 cats ran away, there were 30 - 18 = 12 cats left on the rock.
6. Now, a mouse appeared and they all scared and no cats were left on the rock.

So, the final answer is that there were \boxed{0} cats left on the rock after the mouse appeared.</s>","When four boats carried away 5 cats each, the total number of cats that left the rock is 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cats.

Later 3/5 of the remaining cats left the rock and ran after a mouse, a total of 3/5*30 = <<3/5*30=18>>18 cats.

2. For the next 8 months (a total of 14 months), Bill pays $12/month. So the cost for this phase is 14*$12 = $<<14*12=168>>168.

3. For the remaining 4 months (a total of 18 months), Bill pays $14/month. However, this phase does not exist in the given data, so we ignore it.

Now, let's add up all the costs:

Total cost = Cost for first phase + Cost for second phase

If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the ; tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's denote the cost of the jogger jeans as J and the cost of the tattered jeans as T. We know that T = $28.

2. We are told that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so J = T - $6 = $28 - $6 = $22.

3. Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of that from the jogger jeans. So, he saved $6 * 1/3 = $2 from the jogger jeans.

4. Therefore, he must have saved the remaining $6 - $2 = $4 from the tattered jeans.

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:

5. Let's denote the additional cost of the jogger jeans as X. So, J = T + X, and we know J = $22 and T = $28.

6. Substituting J and T into the equation gives us $22 = $28 + X.

7. Solving for X gives us X = $22 - $28 = -$6.

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans cost than the tattered jeans, and we have found that the jogger jeans cost $6 less. This seems to be a contradiction, but it could be possible if the total savings of $6 doesn't apply to the original prices of the jeans, but rather to the price after the discounts.

If we assume that the total savings of $6 applies to the discounted prices, then the original prices would be $6 more expensive than the discounted prices, and the jogger jeans would indeed be more expensive than the tattered jeans by the difference in their discounts.

In this case, the tattered jeans received a discount of $4 (from $28 to $24), and the jogger jeans received a discount of $2 (from $22 to $20). So, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 - $2 = $2 more than the tattered jeans.

However, if we assume that the total savings of $6 applies to the original prices, then the jogger jeans would have been $6 more expensive than the discounted price, which would make them $6 - $2 = $4 more expensive than the tattered jeans.

So, depending on the interpretation of the problem, the final answer could be either \boxed{2} or \boxed{4}.</s>","Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.
The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.
Cole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28
Hence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.
Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.

                    Kenny is selling his Pokemon cards to buy a , ticket to an amusement park, : which costs $100. He has a collection of cards and plans to sell them for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of them and gets , to go to the amusement ; park with ; $50 in spending cash. How many cards did he start with?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards. This means that the total number of cards he has is three times the number he keeps.

2. This also implies that the number of cards he sells is two times the number he keeps (since the total minus the kept cards equals the sold cards).

3. Let's denote the number of cards he sells as 2x and the number of cards he keeps as x.

4. Each card is sold for $

1.5. So the total amount he earns from selling cards is 1.5 * 2x = 3x.

5. The cost of the amusement park ticket is $100. After paying for the ticket, he has $

50. This means he also received $50 from selling cards. Hence, we can set up the equation 3x - 100 = 50.

6. Solving for x, we get 3x = 150, so x =

50. This means Kenny kept 50 cards and sold 2 * 50 = 100 cards.

7. Since Kenny had three times as many cards as he kept, the total number of cards he started with is 3 * 50 = 150.

{The final answer is \boxed{150}}.</s>","He made $150 selling the cards because 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150
He sold 100 cards because 150 / 1.5 = <<150/1.5=100>>100
The cards he sold were 2/3 of his collection because 1 - (1/3) = 2/3
He started with 150 cards because 100 / (2/3) = <<100/(2/3)=150>>150

How many guests did not get a second hotdog?
                [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of hotdogs prepared.
Since half of the guests were to have two hotdogs each, this means that the caterer prepared for 36 guests * (1 hotdog + 2 hotdogs) = 72 hotdogs.

Step 2: Determine how many guests got a second hotdog.
Since 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog, there were 40 guests - the original 36 guests = 4 extra guests who only ate one hotdog.

Step 3: Determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog.
Since 72 hotdogs were prepared and 40 guests ate a second hotdog, this means that 36 guests * 2 hotdogs - 4 extra guests * 1 hotdog = 72 - 4 = 68 hotdogs were eaten.

3. Indra's sister's name has 4 more letters in it than half of Indra's name.
4. So, the sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Combining both lengths, we can find out the total number of letters in both names:

The cost of the set of pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the set of mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the five utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

So, before the discount, her order costs $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

The discount is 20% off.

To calculate the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by the discount rate:
$165.00 * 20% = $165.00 * 0.20 = $33.00

So, the discount amount is $33.00.

Now, to find the final cost of the order, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost before discount:

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's find out how much money George had initially. If he had 1% left after spending $5, then 99% of his money was spent. Since 99% of his money is $5, we can set up the equation: 0.99 * Initial amount = $5. Solving for the initial amount, we get Initial amount = $5 / 0.99 ≈ $5.05.

2. Next, let's find out how much money George spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs $0.40. So, he spent 3 * $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

3. Now, let's find out how much money George spent on candy bars. He started with $5.05 and spent $1.20 on chips, so he spent $5.05 - $1.20 = $3.85 on candy bars.

4. Finally, let's find out how many candy bars George bought. Each candy bar costs $0.75. So, the number of candy bars he bought is the total amount he spent on them divided by the cost of each candy bar: $3.85 / $0.75 = 5.13.

2. Next, we need to find out how many lollipops each friend received. Since Ray shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends, we divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends.

Lollipops per friend = Number of lollipops shared / Number of friends
= 20 / 4

4. The total cost for the onions and the beef broth is $12.00 (8 pounds of onions + 4 pounds of beef broth = $12.00).

5. This soup serves 6 people. To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings.

                [/INST] Sure, I'd be happy to help with this problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find the width of the room. We know that the area of a rectangle is given by the formula Area = Length * Width. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width: Width = Area / Length.

2. Substitute the given values into the formula: Width = 360 sq ft / 3 yd.

3. However, we need to convert the yards to feet because our Area is given in square feet. We know that 1 yard = 3 feet. So, 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

4. Now, substitute the converted value back into the formula: Width = 360 sq ft / 9 ft = 40 ft.

5. Next, we find the perimeter of the room. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).

6. Substitute the known values into the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (3 ft + 40 ft).

7. Calculate the perimeter: Perimeter = 2 * 43 ft = 86 ft.

So, the perimeter of Billie's bedroom is 86 feet. {The final answer is 86 feet}.</s>","The length of the room is 3 yards * (3 feet / 1 yard) = <<3*(3/1)=9>>9 feet.
The width of the room is 360 square feet / 9 feet = <<360/9=40>>40 feet.
The room's perimeter is 2(40+9) = 98

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each pack of beads contains 20 pieces of beads.

2. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. So, she bought a total of 1*20 (red beads) + 2*20 (clear beads) = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

3. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. So, she bought a total of 3*20 (blue beads) + 4*20 (red beads) = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

4. To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has. So, 140 (Margareth's beads) - 60 (Elizabeth's beads) = 80 beads.

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. {The final answer is 80}.</s>","Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs.
So Elizabeth bought 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 pieces of beads.

So Margareth bought 7 x 20 = <<7*20=140>>140 pieces of beads.
Therefore, Margareth bought 140 - 60 = <<140-60=80>>80 more beads than Elizabeth.

Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the temperature increase during baking is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Step 2: Calculate the temperature after baking.
The initial temperature is 40 degrees. After baking, the house's temperature increases by 15 degrees. So, the temperature after baking is:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Step 3: Calculate the temperature drop when Marcus opens a window.
Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, the temperature drop when the window is open is:
30 minutes / 10 minutes/degree = 3 degrees

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step, and we'll use hours as the unit of measurement for time.

1. Convert Jon's swim, bike, and run times to hours.
   - Swim: 40 minutes = 40/60 = 0.6667 hours (approximately)
   - Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 1 + 20/60 = 1.3333 hours
   - Run: 50 minutes = 50/60 = 0.8333 hours

2. Calculate Jon's total time in hours.
   - Total time = 0.6667 (Swim) + 1.3333 (Bike) + 0.8333 (Run) = 2.8333 hours

3. Calculate James's swim and bike times.
   - James's swim time: 10% faster than Jon's swim time, which is 0.6667 hours.
     - 10% of 0.6667 hours = 0.1 * 0.6667 = 0.06667 hours
     - James's swim time = 0.6667 - 0.06667 = 0.6 hours (approximately)
   - James's bike time: 5 minutes longer than Jon's bike time.
     - 5 minutes = 5/60 = 0.08333 hours
     - James's bike time = 1.3333 + 0.08333 = 1.41663 hours

4. Calculate James's total time for the swim and bike.
   - Total time (Swim + Bike) = 0.6 + 1.41663 = 2.01663 hours

5. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, and we know Jon's total time, we can find James's total time.
   - Jon's total time in minutes is 2.8333 hours * 60 = 169.98 minutes, which we can round to 170 minutes for simplicity.
   - James's total time is 10 minutes less than Jon's total time = 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.

6. Convert James's total time to hours.
   - 160 minutes = 160/60 = 2.6667 hours

7. Calculate James's run time in hours by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time.
   - James's run time = 2.6667 - 2.01663 = 0.65007 hours

8. Convert James's run time to minutes to find the final answer.
   - James's run time in minutes = 0.65007 * 60 = 39.004 minutes, which we can round to 39 minutes.

{The final answer is: James took 39 minutes to run his part of the triathlon.}</s>","Jon did the bike ride in 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes
So his total time was 40+80+50=<<40+80+50=170>>170 minutes
James finished the swim 40*.1=<<40*.1=4>>4 minutes faster
So he finished the swim in 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 minutes
He finished the bike ride in 80+5=<<80+5=85>>85 minutes
James' total time was 170+10=<<170+10=180>>180
So it took him 180-85-36=<<180-85-36=59>>59 minutes to do the run

1. First, we need to convert Movie C's length into minutes. We know that 1 hour = 60 minutes. So,

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

2. Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So,

Movie B = Movie C + 5 = 75 minutes + 5 = 80 minutes

3. Finally, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. So,

Movie A = Movie B / 4 = 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

                [/INST] First, we need to determine how many miles the horse will run in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Time in hours = Time in minutes / 60
              = 30 / 60
              = 0.5 hours

Distance = Speed * Time
         = 32 * 0.5
         = 16 miles

Now, we need to determine how many bails of hay the horse will consume for running 16 miles.

For every mile, the horse consumes 1/2 a bail.
So, for 16 miles, the horse will consume:
16 * (1/2)
= 8 bails

The cost of one bail of hay is $3.
So, the total cost for 8 bails is:
8 * $3
= $24

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so he has:
6 * $5
= $30

After buying the hay, the amount of money Michael has left is:
$30 - $24
= $6

\boxed{The final answer is 6}</s>","The horse runs 16 miles because 32 x (30/60) = <<32*(30/60)=16>>16
The horse needs to eat 8 bails of hay because 16 x .5 = <<16*.5=8>>8
The hay will cost $24 because 8 x $3 = <<8*3=24>>24

Rozanne uses 43 eggs in her eggnog.

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggnog glasses that can be made from the total number of eggs.
If each glass needs 5 eggs, then the number of glasses that can be made from 43 eggs is 43 / 5 = 8.6 glasses. Since we can't have a fraction of a glass, we round down to get 8 glasses.

Step 3: Calculate the number of trays that can hold the total number of glasses.
If each tray holds 5 glasses, then the number of trays that can hold 8 glasses is 8 / 5 = 1.6 trays. Since we can't have a fraction of a tray, we round down to get 1 tray.

The final answer is \boxed{1}.</s>","As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.

1. Price of the case of sneakers = $576
2. He bought a case of 48 sneakers.

So, Price per sneaker = Total price / Number of sneakers
= 576 / 48
= $12

Next, let's calculate the revenue the salesman made from selling the first 17 sneakers.

1. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each.

So, Revenue from first 17 sneakers = Price per sneaker * Number of sneakers
= 20 * 17
= $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue the salesman made from selling the rest of the sneakers.

1. He sold the rest of the sneakers to a department store for $25 each.
2. He had 48 sneakers in total and sold 17 already.

So, Number of sneakers sold to the department store = Total number of sneakers - Number of sneakers sold already
= 48 - 17
= 31

Then, Revenue from the rest of the sneakers = Price per sneaker * Number of sneakers
= 25 * 31
= $775

Now, let's calculate the total revenue the salesman made.

1. Total revenue = Revenue from first 17 sneakers + Revenue from the rest of the sneakers
= 340 + 775
= $1115

Finally, let's calculate the salesman's profit.

1. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

1. We know that the super ticket costs $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an additional $1. That means the total cost of one popcorn and one soda with the super ticket is $21.

2. We also know that the movie ticket costs $12, and the soda costs $3.

3. The question states that you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2. This means that the cost of one popcorn is equal to $12 (the cost of the movie ticket) minus $2 (the savings), which equals $10.

4. However, we also know that the super ticket includes one popcorn and one soda for an additional $1. Since the super ticket costs $20, the popcorn must cost $20 - $1 = $19 - $1 (the cost of the soda) = $18 minus the cost of the soda.

                [/INST] To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to first calculate the total distance traveled and then divide it by the total time taken.

1. Calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
   Distance = Speed * Time
   Distance_1 = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles

2. Calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
   Distance_2 = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles

3. Add the distances to find the total distance:
   Total Distance = Distance_1 + Distance_2 = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

4. Add the times to find the total time:
   Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

5. Calculate the average speed:
   Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours

The final answer is: \boxed{50} mph.</s>","The car drives 60*2=<<60*2=120>>120 miles for 2 hours.

                [/INST] Step 1: Jenna initially has 8 sapphires, and each sapphire is worth $800. So, the value of the sapphires she has can be calculated as follows:
Initial value of sapphires = Number of sapphires * Value of each sapphire
= 8 * $800
= $6400

Step 2: Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires that she trades can be calculated as follows:
Value of traded sapphires = Number of traded sapphires * Value of each sapphire
= 3 * $800
= $2400

Step 3: Since Jenna received 2 rubies in return for the 3 sapphires she traded, we need to calculate the value of these 2 rubies. Each ruby is worth $1200, so the total value of the 2 rubies can be calculated as follows:
Value of rubies = Number of rubies * Value of each ruby
= 2 * $1200
= $2400

Step 4: Now, we add the value of the initial sapphires, the value of the traded sapphires, and the value of the rubies to find the total value of all Jenna's jewels:
Total value = Initial value of sapphires + Value of traded sapphires + Value of rubies
= $6400 + $2400 - $2400 + $2400 (we subtract the value of the traded sapphires because they were traded away and then add the value of the rubies that were gained)
= $6400 + $2400
= $8800

So, the final answer is:
{The final answer is \boxed{8800}}.</s>","First find the total number of sapphires Jenna still has: 8 sapphires - 3 sapphires = <<8-3=5>>5 sapphires

Then find the total value of the rubies: 2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $<<2*1200=2400>>2400
Then amount this to the cost of the sapphires to find the total value of her jewelry: $2400 + $4000 = $<<2400+4000=6400>>6400

1. Each person eats 4 apples a day. So, in 30 days, Marin eats $4 \times 30 = 120$ apples.

2. Similarly, Nancy eats $4 \times 30 = 120$ apples in 30 days.

3. To find the total number of apples eaten by both, we add Marin's and Nancy's consumption: $120 + 120 = 240$ apples.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the volume of each raised bed. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of each raised bed) is given by the formula: Volume = length * width * height.

For one raised bed:
Volume = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet

Bob has 10 raised beds, so the total volume of soil needed is:
Total volume = Volume of one bed * number of beds = 32 cubic feet * 10 = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet = 160 bags

Finally, to find the cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920

                [/INST] Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many green cards there are in the set. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, and there are 15 red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 \times \frac{160}{100} = 24 \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many yellow cards there are. Given that the number of yellow cards equals the sum of the number of red and green cards, we can calculate this as:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 24 + 15 = 39 \]

3. Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add up the numbers of red, green, and yellow cards:
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 24 + 15 + 39 = 78 \]

The final answer is \boxed{78}.</s>","There are 60/100 * 15 = <<60/100*15=9>>9 more green cards than red cards.

                [/INST] The farmer needs to transport a total of 23 trips.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed.
   - Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes = 2 pounds
   - Four 12-pound bags of carrots = 48 pounds
   - Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay = 3150 pounds
   - Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats = 1300 pounds

2. Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:
   - Total weight = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) = 4500 pounds

3. The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, so we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity = 4500 / 2250 = 2

4. However, since the total weight is slightly more than double the truck capacity, the farmer will need to make an additional trip:
   - Number of trips = 2 + 1 = 3

5. But there's an error in the problem statement. The problem seems to imply that the farmer buys forty-two 75-pound bales of hay, but then it states ""hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pounds bales."" This suggests that he actually buys forty-two 75-pound bales of some other ingredient. If we assume that the hay is indeed the main ingredient and there's a mistake in the problem, then the total weight calculation should be:
   - Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes = 2 pounds
   - Four 12-pound bags of carrots = 48 pounds
   - Eighty-two 75-pound bales of hay = 6150 pounds
   - Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats = 1300 pounds
   - Total weight = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 6150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) = 7500 pounds

6. Since the truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we divide the total weight by the truck capacity:
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity = 7500 / 2250 = 3.33 (rounded up to 4)

7. So, after accounting for the mistake in the problem and rounding up, the farmer needs to make 4 trips to transport all the feed.

8. But the question asks for the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, so we need to consider whether these 4 trips are enough to deliver all the feed or not. Since we rounded up in step 7, it's possible that the 4 trips are more than enough. To find out for sure, we can add up the weight of the feed for each type of ingredient:
   - Sugar cubes: 2 pounds per trip, so 2 trips are enough
   - Carrots: 48 pounds per trip, so 1 trip is enough
   - Hay: 6150 pounds / 4 trips = 1537.5 pounds per trip, so 4 trips are enough (rounded down to 3 trips)
   - Oats: 1300 pounds / 4 trips = 325 pounds per trip, so 4 trips are enough

9. Adding up the number of trips for each ingredient:
   - Total trips = 2 (sugar cubes) + 1 (carrots) + 3 (hay) + 4 (oats) = 10 trips

10. However, we made an error in step 6. We should not have rounded up, since the total weight is actually less than double the truck capacity. Therefore, the correct number of trips is:
    - Total trips = 2 (sugar cubes) + 1 (carrots) + 3 (hay) + 4 (oats) =","The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.
He is buying 4 * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 pounds of carrots.
He is buying 42 * 75 = <<42*75=3150>>3150 pounds of hay bales.
He is buying 20 * 65 = <<20*65=1300>>1300 pounds of oat sacks.
The weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = <<2+48+3150+1300=4500>>4500 pounds.
Thus, the farmer needs 4500 / 2250 = <<4500/2250=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.

1. First, let's calculate the total cents earned from aluminum cans in a week. Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, the total cents from aluminum cans in a week is 3 * 2 = \boxed{6} cents.

2. Next, let's calculate the total cents earned from plastic bottles in a week. Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, the total cents from plastic bottles in a week is 5 * 3 = \boxed{15} cents.

3. Now, let's calculate the total cents earned from recycling in a week. This is the sum of the cents earned from aluminum cans and plastic bottles. So, the total cents from recycling in a week is 6 + 15 = \boxed{21} cents.

4. Finally, let's calculate the total cents earned from recycling in a four-week month. We multiply the total cents earned in a week by the number of weeks in a month. So, the total cents from recycling in a month is 21 * 4 = \boxed{84} cents.

                [/INST] Let's break this down:

1. First, we need to understand that Ashley wants to give a tip that is equal to 1/5 of the amount she ordered. But the question doesn't provide the amount she ordered. So, let's denote the amount she ordered as 'x'.

2. The tip amount, therefore, would be (1/5)x.

3. Now, Ashley has to pay $15 for the delivery. So, the total amount she should give the delivery man (including the tip) would be the sum of the delivery cost and the tip amount.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Start with the most basic piece of laundry, which is a sheet. Each room has two sheets. So, for 80 rooms, the total number of sheets is:

   Total sheets = Number of rooms * Sheets per room
   = 80 rooms * 2 sheets
   = 160 sheets

2. Next, we have pillow cases. The problem states that there are twice as many pillow cases as sheets. So, for 80 rooms, the total number of pillow cases is:

   Total pillow cases = Total sheets * 2
   = 160 sheets * 2
   = 320 pillow cases

3. Then, we have towels. The problem states that there are twice as many towels as pillow cases. So, for 80 rooms, the total number of towels is:

   Total towels = Total pillow cases * 2
   = 320 pillow cases * 2
   = 640 towels

4. Finally, we have comforters. Each room has one comforter, so for 80 rooms, the total number of comforters is:

   Total comforters = Number of rooms

5. Adding all these up will give us the total number of pieces of laundry:

   Total laundry = Total sheets + Total pillow cases + Total towels + Total comforters

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since there are 2 shoes in a pair, he gets 5*2 = 10 shoes on Monday.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes. So, he gets 15*2 = 30 shoes on Wednesday.
4. On Friday, he gains another 30 pairs of shoes. So, he gets 30*2 = 60 shoes on Friday.
5. Adding up all these shoes, from Monday to Friday, we have 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 100 shoes.
6. We add these 100 shoes to his initial 200 shoes, so he has 200 + 100 = 300 shoes by the end of Friday.
7. But on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes left.
8. Therefore, on Sunday, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes.

1. First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet because the shark's length is given in feet. We know that 1 foot equals 12 inches. So, 6 inches is equal to 6/12 or 0.5 feet.
2. Then, we need to add the length of the two remoras together to find their combined length. The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot.
3. Now, we need to find what percentage of the shark's body length this combined length of the remoras represents. The shark's body length is 10 feet. So, the percentage is (combined length of remoras / shark's body length) * 100 = (1 / 10) * 100 = 10%.

Final Answer: The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. {The final answer is 10%}</s>","First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<6*2=12>>12 inches

1. First, we convert the time given (240 minutes) into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide 240 by 60.

240 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

2. Next, we convert the hours into days. Since Jason walks 4 days a week, we divide the hours by 4.

4 hours ÷ 4 days/week = 1 hour/day

3. Finally, we calculate how long he has to spend walking each day. Since he has three weeks to prepare for the track team, we multiply the number of days (4) by the number of weeks (3).

3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days

4. Therefore, we divide the total hours he needs to walk (4) by the number of days (12).

4 hours ÷ 12 days = 0.33 hours/day

5. To convert this back into minutes, we multiply by 60.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that there are 9 kids allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

2. Since 3 kids are allergic to both, we subtract these from the total number of kids allergic to each individual allergen to avoid double-counting. So, there are actually 9 - 3 = 6 kids allergic to only dairy and 6 - 3 = 3 kids allergic to only peanuts.

3. However, we are told that there are also kids allergic to neither dairy nor peanuts. The total number of kids in the class is 32. So, the number of kids allergic to at least one of the two allergens (either dairy, peanuts, or both) is 32 - (number of kids allergic to nothing).

4. We know the number of kids allergic to dairy (6) or peanuts (3) individually, and 3 are allergic to both. Therefore, the number of kids allergic to at least one allergen is 6 (dairy only) + 3 (peanuts only) + 3 (both) = 12.

5. So, the number of kids allergic to nothing is the total number of kids minus the number of kids allergic to at least one allergen, which is 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{20}.</s>","First subtract the number of kids who are allergic to each item from the total number of kids: 32 kids - 6 kids - 9 kids = <<32-6-9=17>>17 kids
Then add the number of kids who were double-counted because they're allergic to both things: 17 kids + 3 kids = <<17+3=20>>20 kids

                [/INST] To calculate the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of the plane tickets**: Since the plane tickets cost $5000 each and Tom is buying tickets for two, the total cost for plane tickets is calculated as:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000
   \]
   So, the cost for the plane tickets is $\boxed{10000}$.

2. **Calculate the normal daily cost of the hotel**: The normal price per day for the hotel is $1500. If they are staying for 3 days, the cost without the 20% increase would be:
   \[
   3 \times 1500 = 4500
   \]
   So, the cost for the hotel without the increase is $\boxed{4500}$.

3. **Calculate the increase in hotel cost due to its being 20% more expensive**: The increase in cost due to the hotel being 20% more expensive is calculated as:
   \[
   4500 \times 0.2 = 900
   \]
   So, the increase in the hotel cost is $\boxed{900}$.

4. **Calculate the total hotel cost**: To find the total cost of the hotel, we add the increase to the normal cost:
   \[
   4500 + 900 = 5400
   \]
   So, the total cost for the hotel is $\boxed{5400}$.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the trip**: Finally, we add the cost of the plane tickets to the total cost of the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
   \[
   10000 + 5400 = 15400
   \]
   Therefore, the total cost of the trip is $\boxed{15400}$.</s>","The hotel room is 1500*.2=$<<1500*.2=300>>300 more expensive per night than normal

Step 1: Calculate the weight of the 2010 penny.
The weight of the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.
So, the weight of the 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of the 1959 penny
= (3/4) * 48 grains
= 36 grains

Next, we need to find the combined weight of the two pennies.

Step 2: Calculate the combined weight of the two pennies.
The combined weight of the two pennies = Weight of the 1959 penny + Weight of the 2010 penny

Now, let's calculate how many songs they can still add to their players:

Gabriel's additional songs = Total capacity - Gabriel's current songs
= 100 - 20
= 80 songs

Luri's additional songs = Total capacity - Luri's current songs
= 100 - 60

Finally, we'll find the difference between the number of songs they can still add:

Difference = Gabriel's additional songs - Luri's additional songs

1. First, we need to calculate how many pounds of oats each horse consumes per day. Since each horse can consume five pounds of oats per meal and Uncle Ben feeds them twice a day, that means each horse consumes 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

2. Next, we need to calculate how many pounds of oats all four horses consume per day. Since each horse consumes 10 pounds/day, four horses would consume 10 pounds/day/horse * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

3. Now, we need to find out how many pounds of oats Uncle Ben will need for five days. Since all four horses consume 40 pounds of oats per day, over five days they will consume 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

                [/INST] The problem states that Sally buys one small pizza for $8 and one family-size pizza that costs 3 times as much as the small pizza. We are asked to find the total amount she spends.

Step 1: Find the cost of the family-size pizza.
The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza. So, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.
Cost of family-size pizza = Cost of small pizza * 3
Cost of family-size pizza = $8 * 3 = $24

Step 2: Find the total amount Sally spends.
Total cost = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total cost = $8 + $24 = $32

So, Sally spends a total of $32.

The final answer is {32}.</s>","The cost of the family-size pizza is 3 x $8 = $<<3*8=24>>24.

                    : Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost , $4.00 a pack.  They are currently : on sale for buy one get one free.  She also has a $2.00 coupon.  How much will each individual razor cost, in cents, after the , discount if she buys , 2 packs of razors?
                [/INST] First, let's calculate the discount on each pack of razors due to the sale. Since it's buy one get one free, for every pack bought, Heather will get another one for free. This means she will only pay for one pack out of every two.

The cost of one pack is $4.00, but with the coupon, she can reduce this by $2.00. So, the cost of each pack after the coupon is:

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since Heather is getting one free with each paid pack, she is essentially paying for two razors for the price of one.

So, the cost of two razors is $2.00.

To find the cost per razor, we divide the cost of two razors by 2:

$2.00 / 2 = $1.00

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $1.00 to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:

$1.00 * 100 = 100 cents

So, the cost of each individual razor after the discount is 100 cents.

{The final answer is: 100 cents}</s>","Buy one get one free means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 and she has a $2.00 coupon, so the razors will cost her $4-$2 = $2.00
Each pack has 4 razors and she buys 2 packs for a total of 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 razors
The razors cost $2.00 and she bought 8 so that means each razor costs $2.00/8 = $<<2/8=0.25>>0.25 each

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to understand that in a human pyramid, the height is determined by the height of the tallest person on top, as the other people are standing on their shoulders. In this case, the shortest cheerleader is at the top.

Step 1: Determine the height of the shortest cheerleader.
The question states that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. Since the 10th cheerleader is the shortest, the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

Step 2: Convert the height from inches to feet.
There are 12 inches in a foot. So, 60 inches is 60 / 12 = 5 feet.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\boxed{5}</s>","All but one cheerleader is 64"" tall and these cheerleaders make up the bottom 3 layers of the pyramid. So, when standing on top of each other, they are 64*3 = <<64*3=192>>192"" tall

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to calculate the total cost of the morning rides. Since Paul is driving in the morning twice a day, and he did that for 14 days, the total number of morning rides is 2 (morning rides per day) * 14 (days) = 28 rides.

2. The cost of each morning ride is $6. So, the total cost of all morning rides is 28 (morning rides) * $6 (cost per ride) = $168.

3. Next, we calculate the total cost of the afternoon rides. Paul is also driving in the afternoon twice a day, so he had 28 afternoon rides over 14 days as well.

4. The cost of each afternoon ride is $2. So, the total cost of all afternoon rides is 28 (afternoon rides) * $2 (cost per ride) = $56.

5. Finally, to find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we add the total cost of the morning rides and the total cost of the afternoon rides. That is, $168 (total cost of morning rides) + $56 (total cost of afternoon rides) = $224.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so the total number of oranges Brianne brought is 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of oranges they both have.
The total number of oranges they both have is 50 (from Ashley) + 70 (from Brianne) = 120 oranges.

                [/INST] Let's reason through this problem step by step:

1. Let x be the number of guests. At the first venue, the cost is $200 + $5x (since the flat fee is $200 and each guest's food costs $5).

2. At the second venue, the cost is $25x (since the cost is $25 per person).

3. To find when the two costs are equal, we set up the equation: $200 + $5x = $25x.

4. Solving for x, we get $200 + $5x = $25x => $200 = $20x => x = 10.

5. Therefore, the two venues are equal in cost when there are 10 guests.

{The final answer is \boxed{10}}</s>","The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.

Step 1: From the problem, we know that L + D + B = 43.

Step 2: We also know that Lily found 7 more insects than David, so L = D + 7.

Step 3: Then, we know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so D = B/2.

Step 4: Now we can substitute L = D + 7 and D = B/2 into the first equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Step 5: Replace D with B/2 in the equation: (B/2 + 7) + B/2 + B = 43.

Step 6: Simplify the equation: B/2 + B/2 + B + 7 = 43, which simplifies to B + 7 = 43.

Step 7: Solve for B: B = 43 - 7 = 36.

Step 8: Since D = B/2, then D = 36/2 = 18.

                [/INST] First, let's determine the cost per stick for each type of wood.

For the 2 x 4 piece of wood:
Cost = $4
Number of sticks = 200
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 = $0.02/stick

For the 2 x 8 piece of wood:
Cost = $6
Number of sticks = 400
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 = $0.015/stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood has a lower cost per stick, it is cheaper.

Now, let's determine how many sticks Frederick can make if he buys only 2 x 8 pieces of wood with his $24 budget.

Number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood = $24 / $6 = 4 pieces
Total number of sticks = 400 sticks/piece * 4 pieces = 1600 sticks

Therefore, if Frederick buys the cheapest lumber, he can make a maximum of \boxed{1600} popsicle sticks.</s>","He can buy six 2 x 4's because 24 / 4 = <<24/4=6>>6
He can make 1200 sticks with this wood because 6 x 200 = <<6*200=1200>>1200
He can buy four 2 x 8's because 24 / 6 = <<24/6=4>>4
He can make 1600 sticks from this because 4 x 400 = <<4*400=1600>>1600
He can make 1600 sticks if he buys the cheapest lumber because 1600 > 1200

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we follow these steps:

1. First, we calculate the total number of legs that need snowshoes. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is calculated as:
\[6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 24 \text{ legs}\]

2. Next, we need to determine how many pairs of snowshoes Mario needs to buy. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs needed is:
\[24 \text{ legs} \div 2 \text{ legs/pair} = 12 \text{ pairs}\]

3. Finally, to find the total cost, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair. Given that each pair costs $\$12.00$, the total cost is:
\[12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00/\text{pair} = \$144.00\]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $\boxed{\$144.00}$.</s>","Dogs have 4 legs and a pair is 2 legs so each dog has 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 pair of legs
There are 6 dogs and they each have 2 pair of legs so they have 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 pair of legs
The snowshoes cost $12 per pair and he needs to buy 12 pairs so he will spend 12*12 = $<<12*12=144>>144 on snowshoes

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total cost of bus trips per week.
Janet takes two bus trips each day for five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips in a week is:
2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of bus trips with the current arrangement.
If each bus trip costs her $2.20, then the total cost of bus trips per week with the current arrangement is:
Total cost = Number of trips * Cost per trip
Total cost = 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week

Step 3: Calculate the savings from a weekly bus pass.
If Janet were to buy a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save the difference between the total cost of bus trips with the current arrangement and the cost of a weekly bus pass. So, the savings would be:
Savings = Total cost - Cost of a weekly bus pass
Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, {Janet would save $2.00 per week by buying a weekly bus pass.}</s>","First find the total number of trips Janet takes during the week: 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = <<2*5=10>>10 trips/week

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. So, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. So, the farm has (1/2) * 20 = 10 sheep.
5. Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on the farm. The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
6. Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on the zoo. The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.
7. To find the total number of animals combined, we add the number of animals on the farm and the zoo. So, the total number of animals is 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120 animals.

The final answer is:

                [/INST] Let's start by setting up some equations to represent the information given.

Let's say Sophia bought x onions and y potatoes. Rose bought 4 times as many onions as Sophia, so Rose bought 4x onions, and since Rose also bought 4 times as many potatoes as Sophia, Rose bought 4y potatoes.

The problem states that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so we can set up two equations based on this information:

4x = 12 (equation 1)
4y = 4 (equation 2)

From equation 1, we can solve for x:
x = 12 / 4
x = 3

From equation 2, we can solve for y:
y = 4 / 4
y = 1

So Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
3 onions + 1 potato = \boxed{4}</s>","The number of onions Sophia bought is 12 / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 onions.

If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) ; does he need each day to reach his goal?
                [/INST] First, we need to find out how many days there are between Andy's deadline (July 19th) and his starting point (December 31st). We subtract the day of the week and the month of each date to find the difference in days.

December 31st is on a Thursday. July 19th is on a Wednesday. Since July has 31 days and there are 7 days in a week, the number of days between these two dates can be calculated as follows:

Days in July up to 19th: 31
Remaining days in July: 13
Total days from July to December without considering any day of the week difference: 31 + 13 = 44

Since both dates share the same day of the week, we don't need to add any extra days.

So, there are 44 days between December 31st and July 19th.

Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound. Therefore, his total calorie deficit goal can be calculated as follows:

Total calorie deficit goal = Weight loss goal * Calories burned per pound
                                       = 30 lbs * 3500 calories/pound
                                       = 105,000 calories

To maintain a consistent calorie deficit over the 44 days, Andy needs to establish a daily calorie deficit target. This can be calculated by dividing the total calorie deficit goal by the number of days:

Daily calorie deficit target = Total calorie deficit goal / Number of days
                                          = 105,000 calories / 44 days
                                          = 2386.36 calories/day

There would, however, be an exception to this if Andy's birthday occurs on a rest day (like a Saturday or Sunday) since he wouldn't be able to achieve this target on that day.

To summarize, Andy needs to maintain a net calorie deficit of approximately 2386.36 calories per day for 44 days in order to reach his goal, barring any exceptions related to weekends.

The final answer is Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 2386.36 calories to reach his weight loss goal by his birthday.</s>","January, March, and May have 31 days, February has 28, and April and June have 30, and Andy's birthday is on the 19th day of July. So there are 3 * 31 days + 28 + 2 * 30 days + 19 days = 93 days + 28 + 60 days + 19 days = <<3*31+28+2*30+19=200>>200 days until Andy's birthday.
He wants to lose 30 lbs. At 3500 calories per pound, this is 30 * 3500 = <<30*3500=105000>>105,000 calories total,
To reach his goal, he will have to burn 105,000 calories / 200 days = <<105000/200=525>>525 calories per day more than he consumes.

1. Julie initially had $500.

2. She spent 20% of it on clothes. To find out how much she spent on clothes, we calculate 20% of $500.
   - 20% of $500 = (20/100) * $500 = $100

3. After buying clothes, Julie had $500 - $100 = $400 left.

4. Then, Julie spent 25% of the remaining money ($400) on CDs. To find out how much she spent on CDs, we calculate 25% of $400.
   - 25% of $400 = (25/100) * $400 = $100

5. After buying CDs, Julie had $400 - $100 = $300 left.

1. We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. Let's denote the cost of the house as H and the cost of the lot as L.
3. From the problem, we know that the house costs three times as much as the lot, which we can write as H = 3L.
4. We also know that the total cost is $120,000, which we can write as H + L = $120,000.
5. Now, we can substitute H from the first equation into the second equation to get 3L + L = $120,000.
6. This simplifies to 4L = $120,000.
7. Solving for L, we find that L = $30,000.
8. Now, we can substitute L back into the first equation to find the cost of the house. So, H = 3L = 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.

So, the final answer is \boxed{90,000}.</s>","Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.

Total cost = Cost of one pack * Number of packs
Total cost = $4 * 8 = $32

Next, let's calculate the total revenue Tara earned from selling the bags.

Selling price of one bag = $8
Number of bags sold = Total number of bags bought = Number of packs * Bags per pack
Number of bags sold = 8 * 5 = 40

Total revenue = Selling price of one bag * Number of bags sold
Total revenue = $8 * 40 = $320

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

Total amount of money Ali has = $40 + $120 = $160

Next, Ali gives his sister half of the total amount of money.

Amount given to sister = Total amount of money / 2
Amount given to sister = $160 / 2 = $80

Now, let's calculate the amount of money remaining after giving money to his sister.

Remaining amount after giving to sister = Total amount of money - Amount given to sister
Remaining amount after giving to sister = $160 - $80 = $80

Finally, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner.

Amount used for dinner = (3/5) * Remaining amount after giving to sister
Amount used for dinner = (3/5) * $80 = $48

Amount of money left after buying dinner = Remaining amount after giving to sister - Amount used for dinner
Amount of money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

{The final answer is $32}</s>","Four $10 bills have a value of 4*$10 =$<<4*10=40>>40
The six $20 bills also are worth 6*$20 = $<<6*20=120>>120
Ali has $40+$120 = $<<40+120=160>>160
When he gives his sister half of the money, he remains with the other half, which totals 1/2*$160 = $<<1/2*160=80>>80
He then spends 3/5*$80 = $<<3/5*80=48>>48 on dinner.
The total amount of money that Ali has now is $80-$48 = $<<80-48=32>>32

1. For each grandchild, Martha can make one hat, one ; scarf, one sweater, one pair of mittens, and one pair of socks.

2. It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a hat, so for all three grandchildren, she needs 2 skeins/hat * 3 hats = 6 skeins.

3. It takes 4 skeins of wool to make a scarf, so for all three grandchildren, she needs 4 skeins/scarf * 3 scarves = 12 skeins.

4. It takes 12 skeins of wool to make a sweater, so for all three grandchildren, she needs 12 skeins/sweater * 3 sweaters = 36 skeins.

5. It takes 1 skein of wool to make a pair of mittens, so for all three grandchildren, she needs 1 skein/pair of mittens * 3 pairs of mittens = 3 skeins.

6. It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a pair of socks, so for all three grandchildren, she needs 2 skeins/pair of socks * 3 pairs of socks = 6 skeins.

So, adding up all the skeins needed for each piece of clothing:

6 (for hat) + 12 (for scarf) + 36 (for sweater) + 3 (for mittens) + 6 (for socks) = \boxed{63} skeins of wool.</s>","A full outfit for each child will require 2 skeins per hat + 4 skeins per scarf + 12 skeins per sweater + 1 skein per pair of mittens + 2 skeins per pair of socks = <<2+4+12+1+2=21>>21 skeins of wool.
So to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3 * 21 = <<3*21=63>>63 skeins of wool.

1. First, we need to determine how many rows each color of tulip can form. For red tulips, Jackson can fit 6 in a row. So, if he has 36 red tulips, the number of rows he can make is the total number of tulips divided by the number he can fit in a row. So, for red tulips, that's 36 divided by 6, which equals 6 rows.

2. Similarly, for blue tulips, Jackson can fit 8 in a row. So, if he has 24 blue tulips, the number of rows he can make is the total number of tulips divided by the number he can fit in a row. So, for blue tulips, that's 24 divided by 8, which equals 3 rows.

3. If Jackson is planting all these tulips in the ground, then the total number of rows of flowers he will plant is the sum of the rows of red tulips and the rows of blue tulips. So, 6 rows of red tulips plus 3 rows of blue tulips equals 9 rows.

So, the final answer is {The final answer is 9}.</s>","First, divide the number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row: 36 / 6 = <<36/6=6>>6 rows.

1. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 cup of raisins.
2. Heather bought a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins.

To find out how many batches Heather can make, we divide the total amount of raisins by the amount needed for one batch:

Number of batches = Total raisins / Raisins per batch

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate Ada's daily electricity consumption before adding the new device. This is given as 12 kilowatts per hour.

Step 2: To find out how much Ada spends on electricity each day, multiply her daily consumption by the cost per kilowatt hour. This is 12 kilowatts per hour * $1.50 per kilowatt hour = $18 per day.

Step 3: To find out how much Ada spends on electricity each week, multiply her daily cost by the number of days in a week. This is $18 per day * 7 days = $126 per week.

Step 4: Calculate Ada's new daily electricity consumption after adding the new device. This is her original consumption plus the new device's consumption. This is 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Step 5: To find out how much Ada spends on electricity each day with the new device, multiply her new daily consumption by the cost per kilowatt hour. This is 14 kilowatts per hour * $1.50 per kilowatt hour = $21 per day.

Step 6: To find out how much Ada spends on electricity each week with the new device, multiply her new daily cost by the number of days in a week. This is $21 per day * 7 days = $147 per week.

Step 7: Calculate the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device. This is her new weekly cost minus her old weekly cost. This is $147 per week - $126 per week = $21 more per week.

So, the final answer is {Answer: $21}.</s>","Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.

                [/INST] Let's break it down:

1. First, we need to understand that if one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it means they could paint a whole house in 10 days (since two halves make a whole).

2. Next, we consider that 5 people are working together. Each person's work is added to the total work done. So, if one person can do the job in 10 days, 5 people would do the job in less time.

3. To find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint the whole house, we divide the number of people by the time it takes for one person to complete the job. This is based on the assumption that they work at the same rate and independently.

4. So, 10 days (for one person) divided by 5 (the number of people) equals 2 days.

5. Since we are asked for the time in hours, and we know that there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the time in days by 24.

So, 2 days times 24 hours equals 48 hours.

1. Ophelia has 5 fewer chairs than sofas. Since she has 20 sofas, she has 20 - 5 = 15 chairs.
2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 15 = 45 chairs.
3. Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, Jenna has 45 - 2 = 43 sofas.

Now, to find the total number of sofas and chairs they have, we add up Ophelia's and Jenna's sofas and chairs:

Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 43 = 63
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 15 + 45 = 60

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs they have is 63 (sofas) + 60 (chairs) = \boxed{123}</s>","If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.

1. Josh works out for 4 hours every week, except for some weeks where he works out more.
2. For two consecutive weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each.
3. For another week, he worked out for 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total hours he worked out in these weeks:

For the two weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each, that's 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours.
For the week where he worked out for 6 hours, that's 1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours.

Adding these to the total gives us:

10 hours (for the two weeks) + 6 hours (for the one week) = 16 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours he would have worked out in the other weeks if he had followed his usual routine:

For the weeks where he didn't increase his hours, he worked out for 4 hours each week. He did this for 8 weeks - 3 weeks (where his hours increased) = 5 weeks.
So, he worked out for 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours in these weeks.

Finally, let's add the hours he worked out with extra effort to the hours he worked out with his usual routine:

16 hours (extra effort) + 20 hours (usual routine) = 36 hours.

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 36 hours. {The final answer is 36 hours}</s>","For 2 weeks, he spent 5 hours each for a total of 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 hours

                    question:
                    48 people are riding a bus. On the first stop, ? 8 passengers get off, and , 5 times as many people as : the number who got off from the ! bus get into the bus. On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on. How many passengers , are riding the bus after the second stop?
                [/INST] The problem requires us to calculate the number of passengers on the bus after two stops. We are given that on the first stop, 8 passengers get off and 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on. Then, on the second stop, 21 passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on than the number who got off in the first stop. We can break down the problem into several steps:

Step 1: Find the number of passengers getting on in the first stop:
Since 5 times as many passengers as those who got off get on in the first stop, we can calculate the number of passengers getting on as:
5 \* 8 = 40 passengers

Step 2: Find the total number of passengers getting on or off in the first stop:
The total number of passengers getting on or off in the first stop is the sum of the passengers getting off and the passengers getting on, which is:
8 (passengers getting off) + 40 (passengers getting on) = 48 passengers

Step 3: Find the final number of passengers on the bus after the first stop:
Since 48 passengers got on or off in the first stop and there were initially 48 passengers on the bus, the final number of passengers on the bus after the first stop is:
48 (initial passengers) - 48 (passengers getting off or on in the first stop) = 0 passengers

Step 4: Find the number of passengers getting on in the second stop:
Since 3 times fewer passengers get on in the second stop than the number who got off in the first stop, we can calculate the number of passengers getting on as:
(8 / 3) = 2⅔ ≈ 2 passengers (rounded to the nearest whole number)

Step 5: Find the total number of passengers getting on or off in the second stop:
The total number of passengers getting on or off in the second stop is the sum of the passengers getting off and the passengers getting on, which is:
21 (passengers getting off) + 2 (passengers getting on) = 23 passengers

Step 6: Find the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop:
Since 23 passengers got on or off in the second stop and there were initially 0 passengers on the bus after the first stop, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:
0 (initial passengers) - 23 (passengers getting off or on in the second stop) = -23 passengers

However, it is impossible to have a negative number of passengers on a bus. This is due to the rounding we did in

Step 4, as the actual number of passengers getting on in the second stop is (8/3) = 2.67, which means at least 3 passengers got on in the second stop. Therefore, we need to adjust our answer:

Final answer: {The final answer is 1 passenger on the bus after the second stop.}

Note: The final answer is 1 passenger, not 0. This discrepancy is due to the approximation we made in Step 4.</s>","At the first stop, 5 * 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 passengers get on the bus.
After the first stop the bus has ( 48 - 8 ) + 40 = <<48-8+40=80>>80 passengers.
At the second stop, 21 / 3 = <<21/3=7>>7 passengers get on the bus.
After the second stop there are ( 80 - 21 ) + 7 = <<80-21+7=66>>66 passengers.

                [/INST] First, let's determine the age of Jame and his cousin now.

Jame will be 27 in 5 years, so his age now is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.

At that time, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age, so his cousin's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 - 5 = 55 years.

Since this is the cousin's age in 8 years, we subtract 8 to find his age now: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we find the age difference between Jame and his cousin: 47 (cousin's age) - 22 (Jame's age) = 25 years.

Answer: The age difference between Jame and his cousin is \boxed{25 years}.</s>","James is 27-5=<<27-5=22>>22 years old
In 8 years he will be 22+8=<<22+8=30>>30 years old

So his cousin is 55-8=<<55-8=47>>47 years old now
So there is a 47-22=<<47-22=25>>25 year gap

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Find the cost of the printer**: Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer. Since the computer cost $1,100, the cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer**: The computer cost $1,100 and the printer cost $700, so together they cost $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

3. **Determine the total cost of the two monitors**: The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,800, and the total cost of all items (computer, 2 monitors, and printer) is $2,400. So, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

4. **Find the cost of one monitor**: Since the total cost of the two monitors is $600, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $\boxed{300}$ dollars.</s>","He paid 1100-400=<<1100-400=700>>700 for the printer.

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the group was divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. Since there were 20 kids in total, this means there were 10 girls and 10 boys.

2. Each boy brought back 60 seashells. So, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 60 * 10 = 600 seashells.

3. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, each girl brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

4. Since there were 10 girls, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is 300 * 10 = 3000 seashells.

5. The total number of seashells brought by both groups is 600 + 3000 = 3600 seashells.

6. The question asks for the number of seashells brought by each girl, which we calculated in step 3.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{300} seashells per girl.</s>","When they divided, each group had 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 students.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6 years

2. Now that we know Alyana's age, we can find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we add 2 to Alyana's age (6 years).

4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add up the thickness of all four books to find the total thickness:

Total thickness = Thickness of first book + Thickness of second book + Thickness of third book + Thickness of fourth book

1. The total cost of the dinner is $50.

2. We need to calculate the tip amount first, which is 20% of the total cost.

3. To calculate the tip, we can multiply the total cost by the percentage of the tip. This can be written as: Tip = Total Cost * Percentage of Tip

4. In this case, the percentage of tip is 20%, which is equivalent to 0.20 in decimal form.

5. So, Tip = $50 * 0.20 = $10

6. Now, we need to add the tip to the total cost to get the amount the husband needs to pay.

7. Therefore, the final amount the husband needs to pay is: Total Cost + Tip = $50 + $10 = $60

\boxed{60}</s>","If the total bill is $50, the total tip of 20% would be $50*20% = $<<50*20*.01=10>>10

3. After adding another $10 on a following day, his total becomes $11 + $10 = $21.

4. He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

5. After saving some more, he's able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. To find out how much more he saved, we subtract the amount he had from the tripled amount: $13 x 3 = $39. The difference between $39 and $13 is the amount he saved, which is $39 - $13 = $26.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Elvis saves in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, let's denote the amount he saves in the first half as x.

1. Elvis's total monthly saving target is $1125. We know that in the first half of the month, he saves x dollars per day.
2. In the second half of the month, he saves twice as much, so 2x dollars per day.
3. Since the month has two halves (30 days in each half), the total savings for the month would be: x*(30) + 2x*(30) = $1125
4. Simplifying this equation gives: 30x + 60x = 1125
5. Further simplifying gives: 90x = 1125
6. Finally, we find x by dividing both sides by 90: x = 1125 / 90

Now let's calculate x:
x = $1125 / 90 ≈ $12.50

So, Elvis needs to save approximately $12.50 per day in the first half of the month. In the second half of the month, he needs to save twice as much, so:

Second half daily saving = $12.50 * 2 = $25

The final answer is that Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the second half of the month.</s>","Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y

For apples, the cost is 3 (number of apples) * $1.50 (price per apple) = $4.50
For oranges, the cost is 5 (number of oranges) * $0.80 (price per orange) = $4.00
For peaches, the cost is 6 (number of peaches) * $0.75 (price per peach) = $4.50

Now, let's add up the costs to find the total cost of all the fruits:

Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50
Total cost = $13.00

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is the amount she gave minus the total cost:

Change = Amount given - Total cost
Change = $20 - $13.00

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate how much Jairus gets for each task. He gets $0.8 per task.

2. Next, let's calculate how much Jenny gets for each task. She gets $0.5 per task.

3. Now, let's calculate how much they each get for 20 tasks. Jairus gets 20 * $0.8 = $16. Jenny gets 20 * $0.5 = $10.

4. Finally, let's calculate how much more Jairus gets than Jenny. This is $16 - $10 = $6.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables based on the information given:

- Let $x$ represent the amount of money that Brad gets.
- Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we can express Jeff's amount as $4x$.

Given that the total amount of money to be divided is $100$ dollars, we can set up the equation:

\[x + 4x = 100\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[5x = 100\]

To find the value of $x$, we divide both sides of the equation by $5$:

\[x = \frac{100}{5}\]

\[x = 20\]

Now that we know $x = 20$, we can find out how much Jeff gets by substituting $x$ back into the expression for Jeff's amount:

\[Jeff = 4x = 4 \times 20 = 80\]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80$ dollars.

So, the final answer is {Jeff gets $\boxed{80}$ dollars}.</s>","Brad gets 100/5=<<100/5=20>>20 dollars.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem into clear and logical steps:

1. First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. The alphabet has 26 letters. So, 26 letters * 2 (since she writes it twice) = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of it once. Half of 26 letters is 13 letters. So, 13 letters.

3. The total number of letters she has written so far is 52 (from step 1) + 13 (from step 2) = 65 letters.

4. Elise then re-writes everything she has already written, which is 65 letters.

5. The total number of letters she has written is 65 (from step 3) + 65 (from step 4) = 130 letters.

Therefore, the final answer is {130 letters}.</s>","Elise has written the alphabet twice which is a total of 26 * 2 = <<26*2=52>>52 letters.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.

2. In the second round, these 3 families each call 3 other families, so there are 3*3 = 9 calls in total, which notifies 9 new families.

3. In the third round, these 9 families each call 3 other families, so there are 9*3 = 27 calls in total, which notifies 27 new families.

First, let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. We know that Mark lost 10 pounds per month.
2. Given that he was unwell for 3 months, this means he lost 10 * 3 = 30 pounds over this period.
3. His final weight was 70 pounds.

1. We know that James's play set has 80 toys.

2. Jonathan wants to make a play set five times larger than James's, so the total number of toys in the larger play set would be 80 * 5 = 400 toys.

3. However, Jonathan only needs 2 more toys than he currently has to make this larger play set.

4. Therefore, let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as ""x"". Then, x + 2 = 400 (since he needs to add 2 more toys to have 400 in total).

Next, we apply the 10% discount to this total cost. The discount amount is 10% * ${} = $.

So, the total cost after the discount is the total cost before the discount minus the discount amount:

1. **Initial Commission Calculation:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, which exceeds the base commission threshold of $1000.
   - For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission.
   - Calculation: $1000 \times \frac{30}{100} = $300.

2. **Additional Commission for Sales Over $1000:**
   - For the amount exceeding $1000, which is $1500 ($2500 - $1000), she earns an additional 10% commission.
   - Calculation: $1500 \times \frac{10}{100} = $150.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - To find the total commission Antonella earned, we add the initial commission to the additional commission.
   - Calculation: $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, the total amount of money Antonella earned from her sales is $\boxed{450}$.</s>","Since Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, she got the first 30% commission, which is 30/100*$1000 = $<<30/100*1000=300>>300

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Cold Day Speed**: Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. This means his speed on a cold day is 1 mile per 16 minutes, or equivalently, 1/16 miles per minute.

2. **Warm Day Speed**: On a warm day, Ray swims the same distance (1 mile) in 2 minutes more than twice as long. So, the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a warm day is 2*(16 minutes) + 2 minutes = 34 minutes. Therefore, his speed on a warm day is 1 mile per 34 minutes, or equivalently, 1/34 miles per minute.

3. **Comparison of Speeds**: To compare the speeds, we can calculate the ratio of the warm day speed to the cold day speed. This gives us (1/34) / (1/16) = 16/34 = 8/17.

4. **Time to Swim 3 Miles**: To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we first need to calculate how long it takes him to swim 3 miles on each type of day.

   - On a cold day, at a speed of 1/16 mile per minute, it takes him 3 miles * 16 minutes/mile = 48 minutes.

   - On a warm day, at a speed of 1/34 mile per minute, it takes him 3 miles * 34 minutes/mile = 102 minutes.

5. **Difference in Time**: The difference in time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day is 102 minutes - 48 minutes = 54 minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day. {The final answer is 54 minutes}.</s>","Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. We have a total of 21 buttons in the bag.

2. Seven of these buttons have two holes each. So, to find the total number of holes in these buttons, we multiply the number of such buttons by the number of holes per button. That is, 7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes.

3. The rest of the buttons, which is 21 total buttons - 7 buttons with two holes = 14 buttons, each have four holes. So, to find the total number of holes in these buttons, we multiply the number of such buttons by the number of holes per button. That is, 14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes.

4. To find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we add the number of holes from the two different types of buttons. That is, 14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes.

So, the final answer is \boxed{70}.</s>","There were 21 - 7 = <<21-7=14>>14 buttons with four holes.

1. Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.
2. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's, so we calculate Zack's locker size by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2:
   Zack's locker = Timothy's locker / 2
   Zack's locker = 24 cubic inches / 2
   Zack's locker = 12 cubic inches

Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake ? to the daily ! recommendation of 4 cups. By how many cups must Juan ; reduce his daily coffee intake?
                [/INST] In order to solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks. Juan's doctor has told him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. We need to find out by how many cups Juan's coffee intake needs to be reduced.

Step 1: Determine Octavia's daily coffee intake.
Since Octavia drinks half the ! daily recommended cups of coffee, we don't actually need to know the exact number of cups she drinks. We only know that it's half the recommended amount, but this value will cancel out later in the problem.

Step 2: Determine Juan's daily coffee intake.
Given that Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the recommended amount, Juan drinks 10 times half of the recommended amount. This simplifies to 5 times the recommended amount of coffee.

Step 3: Reduce Juan's intake to the recommended amount.
Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his intake to the recommended 4 cups. So, we need to determine by how many cups this reduction amounts to.

Since Juan's current intake is 5 times the recommended amount, his current intake is 5 times 4 cups, which equals 20 cups of coffee.

Step 4: Find the difference between Juan's current and recommended intake.
To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, subtract the recommended amount (4 cups) from his current intake (20 cups):

20 cups - 4 cups = 16 cups

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \boxed{16} cups.</s>","Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups
Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which translates to 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups
Subtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan’s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups
Juan must therefore reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups

                [/INST] To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of hamsters:
3 cages of hamsters, each having 10 hamsters.
So, the total number of hamsters = Number of cages * Number of hamsters per cage
= 3 * 10
= 30

Next, let's calculate the number of guinea pigs:
3 cages of guinea pigs, each having 5 guinea pigs.
So, the total number of guinea pigs = Number of cages * Number of guinea pigs per cage
= 3 * 5
= 15

Finally, to find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together:
Total number of rodents = Number of hamsters + Number of guinea pigs

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much Susan weighs. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, and Mark weighs 150 pounds, we can calculate Susan's weight as follows:
   Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds = 150 pounds - 20 pounds = 130 pounds

2. Next, we need to find out how much Bob weighs. Since Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, we can calculate Bob's weight as follows:
   Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight = 2 * 130 pounds = 260 pounds

3. Now, to find the average weight of the three friends, we add up all their weights and divide by the number of friends. So, the calculation would be:
   Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 = (150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds) / 3 = 540 pounds / 3

4. Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is:
   Average weight = 180 pounds

So, the final answer is {180 pounds}.</s>","Susan weighs 150 pounds - 20 pounds = <<150-20=130>>130 pounds.

                [/INST] Step 1: Determine the initial angle of the sun from the ground.
The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees from the ground. So, initially, the sun is also 32 degrees from the ground.

Step 2: Calculate the total upward angle the sun will have after 10 hours.
The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. So, after 10 hours, the sun will have moved:
upward movement = rate * time
= 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours
= 50 degrees

Step 3: Calculate the final angle of the sun from the ground.
Since the sun moves straight upward, we simply add the upward movement to the initial angle:
final angle = initial angle + upward movement
= 32 degrees + 50 degrees
= 82 degrees

So, after 10 hours, the sun will be at an angle of 82 degrees from the ground.

                [/INST] First, let's determine how many candles James needs to buy for each son.

For the 12-year-old son, we assume that James wants to buy one candle for each year of his son's age, so he needs 12 candles.
For the 4-year-younger son, James needs 4 candles (one for each year of his age).

In total, James needs 12 + 4 = 16 candles.

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of candles James needs to buy to get at least 16 candles. Since each pack contains 5 candles, we can calculate how many packs are needed by dividing the total number of candles by the number of candles in each pack: 16 / 5 = 3.2. Since James can't buy a fraction of a pack, he needs to buy 4 packs to have enough candles.

Lastly, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of packs by the cost of each pack: 4 * $3 = $12.

{The final answer is: James spends $12 on candles.}</s>","His younger son is 12-4=<<12-4=8>>8 years old

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the total reading time in the first week:**
   - Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
   - There are 7 nights in a week.
   - Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is $15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes}$.

2. **Calculate the total reading time in the second week:**
   - The problem states that in the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.
   - Given that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes it took her to read 100 pages.
   - The time taken to read 100 pages is $\frac{100 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages/1.5 minutes}} = 50 \times 1.5 = 75 \text{ minutes}$.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages read in both weeks:**
   - In the first week, the number of pages Judy could have read (based on her reading time) is $\frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/2 pages}} = 70 \text{ pages}$.
   - Therefore, in two weeks, the total number of pages Judy read is $70 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 170 \text{ pages}$.

Hence, the final answer is $\boxed{170 \text{ pages}}$.</s>","Every night, Judy reads 15 minutes/1.5 minutes = <<15/1.5=10>>10 sets of 2 pages.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step.

1. First, let's determine how old Shiloh will be in 7 years. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so in 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

2. We know that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we represent Shiloh's nephew's current age as N, in 7 years, his age will be N + 7.

3. According to the problem, Shiloh's age in 7 years (51) will be three times the nephew's age in 7 years. So, we can write this as 51 = 3 * (N + 7).

4. Solving this equation for N gives us the nephew's current age. First, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get N + 7 = 51 / 3, which simplifies to N + 7 = 17.

5. Then, subtract 7 from both sides of the equation to get N = 17 - 7 = 10.

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old. There are no units in the problem, so the final answer is an age, not a quantity with any units.

For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which , cost ? $2 each. How many total action figures will he have by the end of the : week?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to determine how much money Peter spends each day on wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday. Since he has $70 and spends an equal amount each day, he spends $70/4 = $17.50 each day on wooden action figures.

2. Since wooden action figures cost $5 each, Peter buys 17.50/5 = 3.5 wooden action figures per day. However, since he can't buy half an action figure, we'll assume he buys 3 wooden action figures per day for 4 days, which totals to 3 * 4 = 12 wooden action figures.

3. For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. Since he has already spent $17.50 per day for 4 days, he has $70 - 17.50*4 = $20 left for plastic action figures.

4. With the remaining $20, Peter can buy 20/2 = 10 plastic action figures.

5. By the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 12 wooden action figures + 10 plastic action figures = 22 action figures.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{22}.</s>","There are 7 days in a week so if he wishes to spend an equal amount of $70 each day that would be $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10
For four days (Sunday through Wednesday) he will spend 4*$10 = $<<4*10=40>>40
He will spend $40 on wooden action figures of $5 each which gives $40/$5 = <<40/5=8>>8 wooden action figures
For the remaining 3 days he will spend 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30
He will spend $30 on plastic action figures of $2 each which gives $30/$2 = <<30/2=15>>15 plastic action figures
Altogether, he will have 8+15 = <<8+15=23>>23 action figures.

1. **Spaying Cost**: It's given that the spaying cost is $200.

2. **Vaccine Cost**: The cost of one vaccine is $20, and since she needs 3 vaccines, we calculate the total vaccine cost as follows:
   \[
   3 \times \$20 = \$60
   \]

3. **Broken Vases Cost**: The cost of one vase is $12, and since the kitten broke 4 vases, we calculate the total cost of the broken vases as follows:
   \[
   4 \times \$12 = \$48
   \]

4. **Total Cost**: Now, we add up all the costs to find the total cost so far:
   \[
   \$200 + \$60 + \$48 = \$308

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses. So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:

20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses

Next, we need to determine how many roses Ford needs to supply to meet the demand of the flower shops over a month. Since a month typically has 4 weeks, we multiply the total weekly demand by 4:

65 (weekly demand) * 4 = 260 roses per month

Now, we need to determine how many roses Ford grows every week and then multiply that by 4 to find out how many roses he grows in a month:

40 (roses grown per week) * 4 = 160 roses per month

Finally, we subtract the number of roses Ford grows in a month from the total number of roses he needs to supply to the flower shops per month to find out how many roses he lacks:

260 (total roses needed) - 160 (roses grown) = 100 roses

{The final answer is that Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.}</s>","The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.
The second flower shop needs 15 x 4= <<15*4=60>>60 roses every month.

So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
The total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160
Therefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.

1. First, we need to determine how many months are in 2 years. We know that a year has 12 months, so 2 years would have 2 * 12 = 24 months.

2. Next, we need to figure out how much money Katina will withdraw in total throughout these 24 months. She withdraws $100 every month, so over 24 months, she would withdraw 24 * $100 = $2400.

3. Now, we subtract the total amount of money withdrawn from her initial savings to find out how much money will be left in the account. That would be $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, there would be $600 remaining in Katina's savings account.

2. The cost for different cheeses and condiments is $30.00 for every 10 sandwiches. So, the total cost to make 10 sandwiches is $3.00 (for bread) + $30.00 (for cheeses and condiments) = $33.00.

3. The food truck sells each sandwich for $7.00. So, for 10 sandwiches, they make $7.00 * 10 = $70.00.

4. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total costs. So, the net profit is $70.00 (revenue) - $33.00 (cost) = $37.00.

Area = 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet

Next, let's calculate the cost of the new carpet. The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, and the padding is $2 per square foot. So, the total cost of the new carpet and padding is $12 + $2 = $14 per square foot.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, and the cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot. So, the total cost of removing and installing the carpet is $34 - $4 = $30 per square foot.

So, the total cost of replacing the carpet for Michael is:

Total cost = cost of new carpet and padding + cost of installing and removing the carpet

Total cost = $14/square foot * 216 square feet + $30/square foot * 216 square feet = $3168 + $6480 = $9648

3. This new number is then divided by 5. 30 divided by 5 is 6.

4. Next, this resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 25. The starting value minus 25 is 20 - 25 = -5. Multiplying 6 by -5 gives us -30.

                [/INST] Sure, I can help with that.

Step 1: Calculate the percentage by which the oven is off.
The oven is set to 450 degrees but the actual temperature is 468 degrees. So, the temperature difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.
This is a difference of 18 degrees from a base temperature of 450 degrees. To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the base temperature and multiply by 100%.
So, the percentage difference is (18/450)*100% = 4%.

Step 2: Calculate the actual temperature that 520 degrees should correspond to.
Since the oven is off by 4%, we can say that the oven is displaying 96% of the actual temperature. So, to find the actual temperature, we divide the displayed temperature by 0.96 (which is equivalent to 100% - 4%).
So, the actual temperature that 520 degrees should correspond to is 520 / 0.96 = 541.67 degrees.

Final Step: Find the temperature Maggie should set her oven at.
Since the oven is showing 96% of the actual temperature, we multiply the actual temperature by 0.96 to find out what temperature Maggie should set her oven at.
So, the temperature Maggie should set her oven at is 541.67 * 0.96 = 520 degrees.

{The final answer is} Maggie should set her oven at 520 degrees. This might seem counterintuitive at first, but remember that this is the temperature the dish should be cooked at when the oven is showing 96% of the actual temperature.</s>","The oven off by 18 degrees because 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18

Therefore X + .04X = 520

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the value of Juan's house. Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, so we need to find 30% of $76,000.

Step 1: Calculate 30% of Herb's house value.
30% of $76,000 = 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800

Step 2: Subtract this amount from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value.
Juan's house value = Herb's house value - 30% of Herb's house value = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Step 3: Add the values of both houses to find their combined value.
Combined value = Herb's house value + Juan's house value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

{The final answer is The combined value of Herb's and Juan's houses is $\boxed{129,200}}.</s>","Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, meaning Juan's house is 30/100*$76000= $<<30/100*76000=22800>>22800 less expensive than Herb's house.
Juan's house is worth $76000-$22800 = $<<76000-22800=53200>>53200
The combined total value of Juan's and Herb's house is $76000+$53200 = $<<76000+53200=129200>>129200

                [/INST] Let's solve this step by step:

1. Judy brought a dozen cups. Since a dozen is 12, Judy brought 12 cups.

2. She brought twice as many dishes as cups. So, she brought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

3. The total number of utensils Judy brought is 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils.

4. Her friend brought 40 cups.

5. Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy. So, her friend brought 24 dishes + 20 more = 44 dishes.

6. The total number of utensils her friend brought is 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils.

7. To find the total number of utensils brought by both, we add the utensils Judy brought to the utensils her friend brought. So, the total number of utensils is 36 utensils + 84 utensils = 120 utensils.

\boxed{120} is the final answer.</s>","Judy brought a dozen cups, which is <<12=12>>12.
Judy's number of plates was twice as many as cups which totals 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24
All the utensils brought by Judy is 24 dishes+12 cups = <<24+12=36>>36
Her friend brought 24+ 20 = <<24+20=44>>44 dishes.
The total number of utensils brought by Judy's friend is 44 dishes+40 cups = <<44+40=84>>84
When they combined their utensils, they brought together 84+36 = <<84+36=120>>120

                    question:
                    90 single use contacts come in 1 box and will last Pete 45 ! days.  Each box is $100.00 and currently ! 10% off.  If he buys 2 boxes of contact, how much will each pair , of contacts cost?
                [/INST] Firstly, let's find out the cost of each pair of contacts when buying one box.

Cost of one box = $100.00
Since there is 10% off the price, the new price will be:
New price = Original price - (Original price * Discount rate)
New price = 100 - (100 * 0.1)
New price = 100 - 10
New price = $90.00

Now, find out the cost of one pair of contacts when one box contains 90 pairs of contacts:
Cost of one pair of contacts = New price / Number of pairs in one box
Cost of one pair of contacts = 90 / 90
Cost of one pair of contacts = $1.00

Now let's see how much two boxes will cost.
Cost of two boxes = Cost of one box * 2
Cost of two boxes = 100 * 2
Cost of two boxes = $200.00

The discount is still applicable, so the new cost of two boxes after the 10% discount is:
New cost of two boxes = Original cost of two boxes - (Original cost of two boxes * Discount rate)
New cost of two boxes = 200 - (200 * 0.1)
New cost of two boxes = 200 - 20
New cost of two boxes = $180.00

Since two boxes contain 180 pairs of contacts, the cost per pair of contacts for two boxes would be:
Cost per pair for two boxes = New cost of two boxes / Number of pairs in two boxes
Cost per pair for two boxes = 180 / 180
Cost per pair for two boxes = $1.00

Therefore, each pair of contacts will cost Pete \boxed{ $1.00 } when buying two boxes.</s>","Each box of contacts is $100.00 with 10% off so that's 100*.10 = $<<100*.10=10.00>>10.00 off
So the box was $100.00 and he has $10.00 off so each box will cost 100-10 = $<<100-10=90.00>>90.00
He buys 2 boxes and each box costs $90.00 so that's 2*90= $<<2*90=180.00>>180.00
1 box of contacts has 90 contacts and he buys 2 boxes so that's 90*2 = <<90*2=180>>180 contacts
He needs 1 contact for each eye and he has 180 contacts so that's 180/2 = <<180/2=90>>90 pairs of contacts
He spent $180.00 to have 90 pairs of contacts so each pair of contacts costs 180/90 = $<<180/90=2.00>>2.00 a pair

Now, let's calculate the total hours John worked: John worked 4 hours on Saturday and 3 hours on Sunday, so John worked a total of 4 + 3 = \boxed{7} hours.

Since both John and Jill earned $10 an hour, Jill earned 3 * $10 = \boxed{$30}, and John earned 7 * $10 = \boxed{$70}.

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday so 3*1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours
John worked 4 hours + 3 hours for 7 hours
John worked 7 hours at $10/hour so he made 7*10 = $<<7*10=70>>70

                [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step: 

1. We know that there are a total of 4,500 jelly beans in the jar, which consists of red, blue, and green jelly beans.
2. Let x represent the number of blue jelly beans in the jar. According to the information on the note, there are 99x red jelly beans and 1.01x green jelly beans.
3. To find the value of x, we can use the total number of jelly beans equation: x (blue) + 99x (red) + 1.01x (green) = 4,500.
4. Simplifying the equation, we get 201x = 4,500, so x = 4,500 / 201 ≈ 22.39. Since we can't have a fraction of a jelly bean, let's round x to 22.
5. Now that we have the number of blue jelly beans (x), we can calculate the number of red and green jelly beans:
   - Red jelly beans = 99x = 99 * 22 = 2,178
   - Green jelly beans = 1.01x = 1.01 * 22 ≈ 22.42, rounded to 22 for simplicity.
6. To find the difference between green and red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 22 (green) - 2,178 (red) = -2,156.

Since the question asks for the difference in a positive value, the final answer is | -2,156 | = 2,156.

Now that we have the initial typing speed (47 WPM), the typing speed after the first increase (52 WPM), and the final typing speed (57 WPM), we can calculate the average typing speed.

The average is calculated by adding all the typing speeds together and then dividing by the number of measurements (in this case, 3).

Average typing speed = (47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM) / 3

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to grow taller than Mark's window.

1. The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet.
2. Each day, the beanstalk doubles its height.
3. The window is 20 feet off the ground.

We want to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet.

Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

{The final answer is} 3 days.</s>","To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet
To find its height after two days, multiply the height after one day by 2: 8 feet * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 feet
To find its height after three days, multiply the height after two days by 2: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. This is taller than the window, so it took three days for the beanstalk to pass the window.

                [/INST] First, let's determine how many grams of mushrooms John eats in a week. Since mushrooms weigh 100 grams per cup, and John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, he eats 2 cups of mushrooms every day.

Next, let's calculate how many grams of protein he gets from mushrooms each day. Since there are 3 grams of protein in 100 grams of mushrooms, and John eats 200 grams of mushrooms each day, he gets 6 grams of protein from mushrooms each day.

Now, let's figure out how many grams of protein he gets from mushrooms in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, John gets 6 grams of protein from mushrooms for 7 days, which equals 42 grams of protein.

Therefore, John gets \boxed{42} grams of protein from mushrooms each week.</s>","He eats 200/100=<<200/100=2>>2 cups per day

                    Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. How old will Jerry be in . 3 years?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

Step 1: Determine Jerry's current age.
We know that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This means that 5 years ago, Jerry was half his current age. If we denote Jerry's current age as J, then 5 years ago he was J/2.

Step 2: Find Jerry's age 5 years ago.
To find Jerry's age 5 years ago, we need to consider that he will be twice this age in 3 years. This means that this age (J/2) is 3 years less than 2 * (J/2). So we have:
J/2 = 2 * (J/2) - 3
Solving for J/2, we get:
J/2 = 3
So, Jerry's age 5 years ago was 3.

Step 3: Find Jerry's current age.
Since Jerry was 3 years old 5 years ago, his current age is 3 + 5 = 8.

Step 4: Find Jerry's age in 3 years.
Jerry will be 8 + 3 = 11 years old in 3 years.

So, the final answer is \boxed{11}.</s>","We know that Jerry's Age/2 = Jerry's Age - 5
Therefore Jerry's Age = 2 Jerry's age - 10
Therefore -Jerry's Age = - 10
Therefore Jerry's Age = <<10=10>>10
In three years Jerry will be 13 because 10 + 3 = <<10+3=13>>13

Each implant costs $2000 and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the crown.
The feature costs an extra $500.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the dental work.
This is the total cost of the implants plus the cost of the crown: $4000 + $500 = $4500.

Step 4: Calculate the remaining cost.
Subtract the deposit from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Step 5: Calculate How many hours he needs to work.
He makes $15 per hour and needs to work for the remaining amount plus his deposit, so the number of hours is $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.

6x = 180

Next, we solve for x:

x = 180 / 6
x = 30

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. Now, let's find the third angle, which is the largest angle:

2. **Next Two Hours Calculation:**
   - Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup.
   - Earnings per hour = Number of cups sold per hour × Price per cup
   - Earnings per hour = 10 cups/hour × $0.60/cup = $6/hour
   - Total earnings for the next two hours = Earnings per hour × Number of hours
   - Total earnings for the next two hours = $6/hour × 2 hours = $12

3. **Total Earnings Calculation:**
   - Total earnings for 6 hours = Earnings from the first four hours + Earnings from the next two hours

                [/INST] First, let's find out how many rotations Jeremy's car tires go through in a month. We know that every 2 miles the car drives, the tires rotate 725 times. So, if Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the number of rotations is:

Rotations in a month = (Miles driven per month / Miles per rotation) * Rotations per mile
= (400 / 2) * 725
= 20 * 725
= 14500 rotations

Next, let's find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced. We know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. So, the number of years before replacement is:

Years before replacement = Total rotations / Rotations per month
= 10,440,000 / 14500
= 720 months
= 60 months
= 5 years

Therefore, Jeremy's car tires will last for {5} years before they need to be replaced.</s>","Jeremy drives 400/2=<<400/2=200>>200 segments of 2 miles
That means each month the car undergoes 200*725=<<200*725=145000>>145,000 rotations
So the tire can last for 10,440,000/145,000=<<10440000/145000=72>>72 months
That means the tires will last 72/12=<<72/12=6>>6 years

                [/INST] 1. First, we need to find the total number of washes Jackie will get from the jumbo bottle of shampoo if she uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle is supposed to give 120 washes with 2 pumps, using 1 pump per wash would give us half of that number. So, we divide 120 by 2.
   Total washes = 120 / 2 = 60 washes

2. Next, we need to find the cost of each pump. The bottle costs $24.00 for 120 washes with 2 pumps. So, we divide the total cost by the total number of pump-washes. Since each use is 1 pump, the total pump-washes is also the total washes.
   Cost per pump-wash = Total cost / Total pump-washes = $24.00 / (120 * 2) = $0.10/pump-wash

3. Finally, to find the cost in cents, we multiply the cost by 100 because 1 dollar equals 100 cents.
   Cost per pump in cents = Cost per pump-wash * 100 = $0.10 * 100 = 10 cents

So, \boxed{10} cents is the cost for each pump-wash.</s>","2 pumps will give you 120 washes so if she only uses 1 pump per wash she doubles the number of washes so she now has 120*2 = <<120*2=240>>240 washes

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35. So, the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

2. Next, we need to calculate the discount Joe will get from the 30% off sale. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 30% (or 0.30 in decimal form). So, the discount is $60 * 0.30 = $18.

3. Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Joe needs to pay. This is $60 - $18 = $42.

4. Finally, we subtract the amount Joe has to pay from the $50 he initially had. This is $50 - $42 = $8.

So, the final answer is \boxed{8}. Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.</s>","The price of the two clothing items totals 35 + 25 = <<35+25=60>>60 dollars before discount.

1/4 * 7 = 7/4 = 1.75 dozen

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of butter are needed to make 1.75 dozen croissants. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, so we multiply 1/4 by 1.75 to get the total pounds of butter needed:

1/4 * 1.75 = 1.75/4 = 0.4375 pounds

So, Juan will need 0.4375 pounds of butter to make 1.75 dozen croissants.

                [/INST] First, we need to understand that the cost of repaving a street depends on its length. The cost per meter is given as $194.

Now, let's calculate the cost for Monica's street:
Cost for Monica's street = Length of Monica's street * Cost per meter
                                 = 150 meters * $194/meter
                                 = $28,100

Next, let's calculate the cost for Lewis' street:
Cost for Lewis' street = Length of Lewis' street * Cost per meter
                                   = 490 meters * $194/meter
                                   = $94,460

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the cost for the initial 5 months and then calculate the additional funding required for the additional 5 months.

1. The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000.

2. The research ended up taking 10 times longer than initially planned, so the additional 5 months amount to 5 * 10 = 50 months.

3. Every month after the first 5 took 50% more funding per month. This means the monthly funding after the first 5 months is $100,000 * 1.5.

4. The additional funding required for the 50 months is $100,000 * 1.5 * 50.

5. To find the total cost of the research, we add the initial funding to the additional funding.

2. Now, we need to determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the 750kg of meat from Bill's bull. To do this, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day. So, the number of days is 750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days.

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull. {The final answer is 5 days}.</s>","In a day Bill sells 15 * 10 = <<15*10=150>>150kg of meat.

                [/INST] Sure, let's calculate this step by step:

1. First, we need to figure out how many hours John spent in physical therapy each week. He went twice a week for 2 hours at a time, so:

Hours per week = Times per week * Hours per time
    = 2 * 2
    = 4 hours

2. Next, we need to find out the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy over the 6 weeks:

Total hours = Hours per week * Total weeks
    = 4 * 6
    = 24 hours

3. Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the physical therapy. The cost is $125 per hour, so:

Total cost = Total hours * Cost per hour
    = 24 * $125

1. Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece every 2 hours during school, which lasts 8 hours. So, he chews 8/2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, adding 2 more pieces to the total he's chewed.
4. So far, Jim has chewed 4 (school) + 1 (home) + 1 (dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.
5. He starts with 20 pieces and has chewed 6, leaving him with 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum.
6. Jim then gives half of his remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14/2 = 7 pieces of gum.
7. After giving gum to his sister, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

{The final answer is 7 pieces of gum}.</s>","Jim goes to school for 8 hours, so if he chews 1 stick of gum every 2 hours that means he chews 8/2= <<8/2=4>>4 sticks of gum
Jim chews 1 stick on the way home, plus 2 sticks after dinner for a total of 1+1=2 sticks of gum
His sister asks for half his remaining gum. Jim started with 20 and has chewed 6, so he has 20-6=<<20-6=14>>14 sticks left
This means Jim gives her 14/2=<<14/2=7>>7 sticks of gum

So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old.

Step 2: Determine Charmaine's age 4 years from now.
Since Charmaine is currently 4 years old, we add 4 to her current age to find out how old she will be 4 years from now.
4 + 4 = 8
Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

                [/INST] To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. Since 1 Mb has 1000 kb, we divide her speed by 1000.

Internet speed in Mb per second = Internet speed in kb per second / 1000
= 20 kb per second / 1000
= 0.02 Mb per second

Then we convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. Since there are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 minutes * 60 seconds), we multiply her speed by 3600.

                [/INST] Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. The tow truck towed 10 cars for each of the first three days. So, for the first three days, it towed a total of 10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars.

2. For the remaining days of the week, there are 4 days left in the week (7 days in a week - 3 days = 4 days). The truck towed 4 fewer cars each day for these days. So, it towed 10 cars - 4 cars * 4 days = 20 fewer cars.

3. The total number of cars towed in the remaining days of the week is then 20 cars/day * 4 days = 80 cars.

4. Adding the cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days gives us the total number of cars towed that week: 30 cars + 80 cars = 110 cars.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is 110 cars}.</s>","On the first three days, towing ten cars a day, the tow truck pulled 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 cars.
It pulled four fewer cars each day, which is 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 cars on the remaining days.
If it pulled ten cars for three days and four less on the remaining days, then it pulled for 7-3 = 4 days, four cars less each day.

                [/INST] First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet since the roller coaster's height requirement is given in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

Adam's height in feet = Adam's height in inches / 12
= 40 inches / 12
= 3.33 feet (rounded to two decimal places)

Next, we need to find out how much Adam needs to grow to reach the minimum height requirement of 4 feet:

Height needed to reach = Roller coaster's minimum height - Current height
= 4 feet - 3.33 feet
= 0.67 feet (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, we know that Adam grows at a rate of 2 inches a year. To find out how many inches this is in feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

Adam's annual growth in feet = Adam's annual growth in inches / 12
= 2 inches / 12
= 0.17 feet (rounded to two decimal places)

Finally, we can calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow enough to ride the roller coaster:

Years needed = Height needed to reach / Adam's annual growth in feet

1. First, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars James sold. Since he sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, the total cost is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

2. Next, we need to calculate how much the car company paid for these cars. The company paid 30% of the price, so they paid 0.30 * $250,000 = $75,000 for the cars.

3. Now, we can calculate James's profits. His profits are the total cost of the cars minus what the company paid for them, which is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

4. Finally, we need to calculate James's commission. James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500.

                [/INST] The problem is asking for the total price of three jewels: a diamond, a gold, and a silver in a jeweler's store. We know the following:

1. The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell.
2. The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell.
3. The price of a diamond Jewell is $2000.

Let's find the price of the jewels step by step:

1. Since the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell, and a diamond Jewell is $2000, the price of a gold Jewell is:

Price of Gold Jewell = (4/5) * Price of Diamond Jewell
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

2. The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell, so the price of a silver Jewell is:

Price of Silver Jewell = Price of Gold Jewell - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

3. The total price for all three jewels is:

Total Price = Price of Diamond Jewell + Price of Gold Jewell + Price of Silver Jewell
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

Therefore, the total price for all three jewels is $4800.

{The final answer is: $4800}</s>","If a diamond Jewellcosts $2000, the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5*$2000 = $1600
Silver costs $400 less than gold Jewell, which means a silver Jewell costs $1600-$400 = $1200
The price of the three jewels combined is $1200+$1600+$2000 = $<<1200+1600+2000=4800>>4800

Next, let's determine the number of rose stamps Max bought. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so:

Rose stamps = Truck stamps - 9

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to find out how far ahead Bob is per hour. Since Tom is driving at 70 mph and Bob is driving at 55 mph, the difference in their speeds is 70 - 55 = 15 mph. This means that every hour, Tom gets 15 miles closer to Bob.

2. Second, we need to determine how long it will take Tom to cover the 75-mile gap. We can do this by dividing the distance by the speed at which Tom is closing the gap, which we found to be 15 mph in step 1.

So, time = distance / speed = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

{The final answer is: 5 hours}</s>","Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour to Bob's 55 miles per hour, meaning Tom is gaining at a rate of 70 mph - 55 mph = <<70-55=15>>15 mph.

1. We know that Manny's classes cost $60 in total.

2. We also know that the cost per class is more than $10.

3. Let's denote the cost per class as x. So, the total cost can be represented as 10x (since there are 10 classes).

4. We know that 10x equals $60. So, x equals $6.

5. Now, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the total cost per class becomes more than $10.

6. If Manny misses one class, the total cost per remaining class would be 60 / 9 (since he's paying for 9 classes now).

7. If Manny misses two classes, the total cost per remaining class would be 60 / 8.

8. If Manny misses three classes, the total cost per remaining class would be 60 / 7.

9. We continue this until we find a situation where the cost per class is more than $10.

10. When Manny misses four classes, the total cost per remaining class becomes 60 / 6, which is $10. But we want it to be more than $10.

1. We know that Jewel processes 50 customers a day.
2. Since Julie is twice as fast, she processes 2 times 50 customers a day, which is 100 customers a day.
3. Both of them work all 7 days of the week.

Now, let's calculate the total weekly production for each of them:

1. Jewel's weekly production is her daily production multiplied by the number of days worked: 50 customers/day * 7 days = 350 customers/week.
2. Julie's weekly production is her daily production multiplied by the number of days worked: 100 customers/day * 7 days = 700 customers/week.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of one apple and one orange first, and then calculate the cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

1. The cost of one apple is calculated by dividing the total cost of the apples by the number of apples. So, $5.20 divided by 4 equals $1.30 per apple.

2. Similarly, the cost of one orange is calculated by dividing the total cost of the oranges by the number of oranges. So, $3.30 divided by 3 equals $1.10 per orange.

3. Now, to calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges, multiply the cost of one apple by 5, and the cost of one orange by 5. This gives us $6.50 for 5 apples and $5.50 for 5 oranges.

4. Finally, add the cost of the apples and oranges together to get the total cost. So, $6.50 plus $5.50 equals $12.00.

Therefore, Clyde will pay \boxed{$12.00} for 5 apples and 5 oranges.</s>","Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.

                [/INST] First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole Bob wants to dig. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

Volume = length × width × height

In this case, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the height (or depth) is 3 feet. So, the volume of the hole is:

Volume = 6 feet × 4 feet × 3 feet = 72 cubic feet

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to dig this volume of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. So, the time it takes to dig the hole will be proportional to the volume of the earth he needs to move.

Time = Volume × Time per cubic foot

In this case, the volume is 72 cubic feet and the time it takes to move one cubic foot is 3 seconds. So, the total time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

Time = 72 cubic feet × 3 seconds/cubic foot = 216 seconds

Therefore, the final answer is:

                [/INST] First, we need to find the cost of the dress pants. Since they cost 1/5 the price of the suits, we can set up the equation: Dress Pants Cost = (1/5) * Suit Cost

The Suit Cost is $750, so: Dress Pants Cost = (1/5) * $750 = $150

Next, we need to find the total cost of the shirts. We know there are 3 shirts for each suit, and James bought 10 suits, so there are 3 * 10 = 30 shirts.

The cost of the shirts is $60 each, so the total cost for the shirts is $60 * 30 = $1800

Now we can calculate the total cost. James bought 10 suits at $750 each, 10 dress pants at $150 each, and 30 dress shirts at $60 each.

The total cost is therefore: Cost = (10 * $750) + (10 * $150) + (30 * $60) = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800

1. We know that Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is currently half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

                    A bag : of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. How much flour (in ; kilograms) ? was in three bags in total, before it was divided into portions?
                [/INST] First, we need to determine the amount of flour in one bag before it was divided into portions.

1 kg = 1000 g
1 kg = 1000/1000 = 1 portion
1 portion = 2 kg

So, one bag contains 2 portions.

Now, let's find out how much flour was in a bag before it was divided.

Flour in one bag = Portions per bag * Flour per portion
= 2 portions * 2 kg
= 4 kg

Since there were three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by three.

Total flour = Flour per bag * Number of bags
= 4 kg * 3
= 12 kg

Therefore, there was \boxed{12} kilograms of flour in the three bags before they were divided into portions.</s>","A bag of flour has 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 kilograms.

Next, let's calculate how many miles Stanley biked. We do this in the same way as before.
Stanley's distance = speed * time
= 10 miles per hour * 2.5 hours
= 25 miles

Finally, to find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we add their distances together.
Total distance = Alisa's distance + Stanley's distance

                [/INST] Sure, I can help break down this problem for you. We'll solve it step by step.

1. **Identify the time taken to dig through soil:** Bill can dig at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil. He has to dig through 24 feet of soil. So, the time taken to dig through soil is: Time = Distance/Speed = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

2. **Identify the time taken to dig through clay:** Bill can dig at half the speed through clay. So, his speed through clay is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He has to dig through 8 feet of clay. So, the time taken to dig through clay is: Time = Distance/Speed = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

3. **Calculate the total time taken to dig the well:** The total time taken is the sum of the time taken to dig through soil and clay. So, the total time taken is: Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, the final answer to your question is that it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.</s>","First find how fast Bill can dig through clay: 4 feet/hour / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 feet/hour

Then find how long he spends digging through soil in total: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = <<24/4=6>>6 hours
Then add the time he spends digging through soil and clay to find the total digging time: 4 hours + 6 hours = <<4+6=10>>10 hours

So, the total number of people is 1 (himself) + 1 (his teacher) + 25 (his classmates) = 27 people.

Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Howie will buy for each person. Since he decided to get one of each flavor for everyone, this means 2 cupcakes per person.

Therefore, the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy is the total number of people multiplied by the number of cupcakes per person. That is, 27 people * 2 cupcakes/person = 54 cupcakes.

1. **Initial likes calculation:**
   Fishio initially got 2000 likes on her selfie.

2. **Increase in likes after 1 week:**
   The number of likes increased to 70 times the initial number of likes three weeks later. First, we find the likes after this increase:
   \[ \text{Likes after increase} = 2000 \times 70 = 140,000 \]

3. **New likes calculation:**
   Fishio received 20,000 more likes after these 3 weeks. To find the total likes, we add these new likes to the post-increase likes number:
   \[ \text{Total likes} = 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000 \]

Thus, the final number of Instagram likes after considering Fishio's increases and additional new likes is:

\[ \boxed{160,000} \]

                [/INST] On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. With the $2 voucher, the total cost before the voucher was 20 * $20 = $400. After applying the $2 voucher, the total cost became $400 - $2 = $398.

The next day, the price per pomegranate increased to $30. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates, so the total cost before the discount was 20 * $30 = $600. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so Sheila paid 10% less.

Calculating the 10% loss on Sheila's purchase, we get $600 * 0.10 = $60. Therefore, Sheila paid $600 - $60 = $540 for her pomegranates.

Now, we want to find the difference between the final prices paid on the two days. Clara paid $398 on Tuesday, and Sheila paid $540 on Wednesday.

Calculate the total amount she made in two months if in ! the second ; month her sales were 3/4 of the total . sales of the first month.
                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let $x$ represent the earnings from red hats in a month. According to the problem, the earnings from green hats are twice as much as the earnings from red hats. Therefore, the earnings from green hats in a month can be represented as $2x$.

2. The total earnings in a month are the sum of the earnings from red and green hats. So, the total earnings in a month are $x + 2x = 3x$.

3. In the second month, Ariadne's sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the earnings in the second month are $\frac{3}{4} \times 3x = \frac{9}{4}x$.

4. To find the total earnings in two months, we add the earnings of the first month to the earnings of the second month. This gives us $3x + \frac{9}{4}x = \frac{12}{4}x + \frac{9}{4}x = \frac{21}{4}x$.

5. We know that the earnings from red hats in a month are $400. Therefore, $x = 400$.

6. Substituting $x = 400$ into the expression $\frac{21}{4}x$, we get $\frac{21}{4} \times 400 = 2100$.

Therefore, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is $\boxed{2100}$ dollars.</s>","Since the total sales of red hats were half that of green hats in the first month, she made 2*$400=$<<2*400=800>>800 from green hats.

2. But we know that he gets 1 hour free. So, the total number of hours he paid for is 4 hours (total time) minus 1 hour (free time) equals 3 hours.

3. The first hour costs $15. The next two hours cost twice as much as the first hour because each hour after that is twice the cost. So, each of these two hours costs $15 * 2 = $30.

4. To find the total cost, we add up the cost of each hour. So, $15 (for the first hour) + $30 (for the second hour) + $30 (for the third hour) equals $75.

2. Her weekly wage should be $300, but some amount has been withheld.

3. Now, her bank account holds $420.

4. Since she hasn't received any other money into her bank account this week, the difference between the current amount in her account and her initial amount is the withheld amount.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the number of deviled egg halves Lori will need for all her guests. Since each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves and she has 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

Total deviled egg halves = Number of guests * Deviled egg halves per guest
                        = 16 * 3
                        = 48 deviled egg halves

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs Lori will need to make these 48 deviled egg halves. Since one egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the total number of whole eggs needed is:

Total whole eggs = Total deviled egg halves / Eggs per deviled egg half
               = 48 / 2
               = 24 whole eggs

Finally, a dozen eggs is equal to 12 eggs. So, the number of dozens of eggs Lori will need is:

Dozens of eggs = Total whole eggs / Eggs per dozen
              = 24 / 12
              = 2 dozens

{The final answer is \boxed{2}}</s>","She is inviting 16 guests that will eat 3 deviled egg halves each so she needs 16*3 =<<16*3=48>>48 halves

                [/INST] To carefully break down the costs and find the total expenditure James incurred for the first year, we start by calculating the yearly cost of the hanger. Since he pays $5000 a month to rent the hanger, over a year, this amounts to:
\[5000 \, \text{dollars/month} \times 12 \, \text{months} = 60000 \, \text{dollars}\]

Next, we calculate the yearly cost of fuel. Given that he spends twice as much on fuel as he does on the hanger, the cost for fuel is:
\[2 \times 60000 \, \text{dollars} = 120000 \, \text{dollars}\]

Adding these two expenses gives us the total annual maintenance cost:
\[60000 \, \text{dollars} + 120000 \, \text{dollars} = 180000 \, \text{dollars}\]

Finally, to find the total cost for the first year, including the initial cost of the plane, we add the initial plane cost to the annual maintenance costs:
\[150000 \, \text{dollars} + 180000 \, \text{dollars} = 330000 \, \text{dollars}\]

Therefore, the total cost for James to buy and maintain the plane for the first year is \(\boxed{330000}\) dollars.</s>","The fuel cost 5000*2=$<<5000*2=10000>>10000 per month

So he spends 12*15000=$<<12*15000=180000>>180,000 a year
That means the total cost was 150,000+180,000=$<<150000+180000=330000>>330,000

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we will break down the information and the steps needed to find the answer.

1. The problem states that it took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Since it took her 30 minutes to cook rice, it took her 30 + 20 = \boxed{50} minutes to cook pork.

2. It also states that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the time taken to cook beans is half of the sum of the time taken to cook rice and pork. Therefore, the time taken to cook beans is (30 + 50) / 2 = \boxed{40} minutes.

3. To find the total time taken to cook all the food, we add the time taken to cook each food item. So, the total time taken is 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = \boxed{120} minutes.

Therefore, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food.</s>","If rice took thirty minutes to cook, pork took 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the cost of each mixture separately.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts), the cost would be:
Cost of 1/2 pound almonds = 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5

So, the total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts), the cost would be:
Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5

So, the total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, to find out how much more it costs for the first mixture than the second mixture, we subtract the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture:

Difference = $10 - $7 = $3.

{The final answer is \boxed{3}.}</s>","One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
One-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.
A one-third pound of walnuts costs $15/3 = $<<15/3=5>>5.
So, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $5 + $5 = $10.
And 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $2 + $5 = $7.
Therefore, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $10 - $7 = $3 more than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

                [/INST] Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

Step 1: We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2. So the total number of legs can be represented as:
             4S + 2G = 70

Step 2: We also know that each animal has one head. So the total number of heads can be represented as:
             S + G = 20

Step 3: Now we can solve this system of equations. First, let's express G from the second equation:
             G = 20 - S

Step 4: Then substitute G into the first equation:
             4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Step 5: Simplify and solve for S:
             4S + 40 - 2S = 70
            2S = 30
            S = 15

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

{The final answer is 15 sheep.}</s>","Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.
Therefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.
The animals have 2g + 4s = 70 legs.

2g + 80 - 4g = 70.
2g = 10.
There are therefore 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 geese.
There are 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 sheep remaining on the farm.

The total cost of all the candies is the cost of the candies of type A plus the cost of the candies of type B, which is $3.5 + $7.5 = $11.00.

Adam paid the cashier $15.00. The change he gets back is the amount he paid minus the total cost of the candies, which is $15.00 - $11.00 = $4.00.

1. We know that Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. So, the total number of good days is 12.

2. Out of the first 24 days, the first eight were good, the next eight were bad, and the last eight were neutral. So, in the first 24 days, there were 8 good days.

3. In the next three days, two were good, so the total number of good days after 27 days is 8 (from the first 24 days) + 2 (from the next three days) = 10.

4. After 27 days, there are 30-27 = 3 days left in the month. Since every day's mood is either good or neutral, and there are no bad days left, all the remaining days must be good or neutral.

5. Since two of the last three days were good, Christina has 10 (from the first 27 days) + 2 (from the last three days) = 12 good days in total for the month.

                [/INST] Step 1: Convert the height of the bamboo from feet to inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 20 feet is equal to 20*12 = 240 inches.

Current height = 240 inches
Target height = 600 inches
Growth rate = 30 inches/day

Step 2: Calculate the total growth needed to reach the target height.
Total growth needed = Target height - Current height
Total growth needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Calculate the number of days needed to reach the target height.
Number of days = Total growth needed / Growth rate
Number of days = 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is \boxed{12}.</s>","Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so he needs an additional 8 toys for these new dogs.
3. After buying these additional toys, James goes back to see that there are twice as many new dogs as when he left. This means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs since he left, so he needs an additional 16 toys for these new dogs.

- He bought 8 additional toys for the initial 8 more dogs.
- He bought 16 more toys for the 16 new dogs.
- He doesn't need 3 toys for the 3 dogs that left.

1. First, we need to find out how much money Dylan invested. Since he invested 2/5 of the total amount, we need to find 2/5 of $1200.

Investment by Dylan = (2/5) * $1200 = $480

2. Next, we need to find out how much money is left after Dylan's investment. We do this by subtracting Dylan's investment from the total amount.

Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment
   = $1200 - $480
   = $720

3. Now, we need to find out how much money Frances invested. She invested 2/3 of the remaining amount.

Investment by Frances = (2/3) * Remaining amount
   = (2/3) * $720

4. Finally, we can find out how much money Skyler invested by subtracting the investments of Dylan and Frances from the total amount.

Investment by Skyler = Total amount - (Investment by Dylan + Investment by Frances)

Step 2: Next, calculate the number of signatures Carol and Jennifer will need to collect in the remaining weeks to reach their goal.
Carol has 20 signatures, Jennifer has 44 signatures, and they want to reach 100 signatures between them. So, the number of additional signatures they need to collect is:

100 (total goal) - 20 (Carol's current signatures) - 44 (Jennifer's current signatures) = 36 signatures

Step 3: Now, divide the number of additional signatures needed by the number of remaining weeks to determine how many signatures the sisters need to collect per week to reach their goal.

36 signatures / 3 weeks = 12 signatures per week

Step 4: Since Carol and Jennifer are collecting signatures together, divide the number of signatures needed per week by 2 to determine how many signatures each sister needs to collect per week.

12 signatures / 2 sisters = 6 signatures per sister per week

1. We know that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max has. Since Katarina has 68 cookies, this means:
   Max's cookies = Katarina's cookies + 5

1. First, let's denote the original length of the dress as x.

2. Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extended length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

3. She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress, so the total length becomes 1.5x + 20.

4. According to the problem, the final design is 140cm long. So, we can set up an equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

5. To solve for x, first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation: 1.5x = 120.

6. Then, divide both sides by 1.5 to find x: x = 120 / 1.5 = 80.

So, the original dress was 80cm long. {The final answer is: 80 cm}.</s>","Without the lace trim, the dress is 140cm full length – 20cm lace trim = <<140-20=120>>120cm.

                [/INST] First, we need to convert both mowing times into minutes. Chris can mow his entire lawn in 40 minutes in ""rabbit"" mode, so in ""turtle"" mode, it takes him one hour, which is 60 minutes.

If Chris uses ""turtle"" mode for half of the lawn and ""rabbit"" mode for the other half, we can calculate the time it takes for each half separately and then add them together.

For the ""turtle"" mode half:
60 minutes (for the whole lawn) / 2 = 30 minutes for half the lawn

For the ""rabbit"" mode half:
40 minutes (for the whole lawn) / 2 = 20 minutes for half the lawn

Now, we add the times for both halves:
30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes

{The final answer is:} \boxed{50}</s>","He spends 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 minutes in turtle mode
He spends 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 minutes in rabbit mode
He took 30+20=<<30+20=50>>50 minutes to mow the lawn.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to determine the total time it takes for John and Jack to get to the fire station. According to the problem, it takes them 6 minutes to get to the library and 13 minutes to get from the library to the fire station. So, the total time is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

2. The total amount of time they have to get to school is 30 minutes.

3. To find out how much longer they have to get to school, we subtract the time it takes them to get to the fire station from the total time they have. So, 30 - 19 = 11 minutes.

So, the final answer is {John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late}.</s>","John and Jack arrive at the library with 30 - 6 = <<30-6=24>>24 minutes left to reach the fire station.

1. For the apples, she buys 1 kilo at $4 per kilo, so the cost is 1 * $4 = $4.
2. For the bananas, she buys 2 kilos at $2 per kilo, so the cost is 2 * $2 = $4.
3. For the oranges, she buys 2 kilos at $3 per kilo, so the cost is 2 * $3 = $6.

Finally, to get the total cost, we add up the cost of each type of fruit:

Total cost = Cost for apples + Cost for bananas + Cost for oranges = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14

The final answer is {The total cost is $14}.</s>","1 kilo of apples costs $<<1*4=4>>4.

                [/INST] Let's tackle this problem step-by-step:

1. **Establish Variables**: Assume each twin is 'T' years old, and each triplet is 'R' years old.

2. **Formulate the Ages of the Twin and Triplet Pairs**: One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. Thus, their ages will be T and (T-7) respectively.

3. **Set up the Total Age Sum**: The total age sum of the twin and triplet groups is 44. Therefore, we can say that:
   \[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

4. **Express the Age of One Twin**: The question asks for one twin's age, so we need to relate 'R' to 'T'. If the above formula was in terms of one of the triplets rather than the age we want we could rewrite our formula to:
   \[ 2T + 3(T - 7) = 44 \]

5. **Solve for 'T'**: Solve the equation as follows:
   \[ 2T + 3(T - 7) = 44 \]
   \[ 2T + 3T - 21 = 44 \]
   \[ 5T - 21 = 44 \]
   \[ 5T = 44 + 21 \]
   \[ 5T = 65 \]
   \[ T = \frac{65}{5} \]
   \[ T = 13 \]

The final calculation gives us that one twin must be **13 years old**.

{The final answer is the age of one twin is 13 years}.</s>","Let T = age of triplet
Twin's age = T + <<+7=7>>7
Twin's combined age = 2 * (T + 7)

                [/INST] 1. First, let's find out how much Manolo spent on one candy. He bought four candies and spent $3.20 in total. So, the cost of one candy is $3.20 / 4 = $0.80.
2. Now, let's calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost for 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.
3. Next, let's calculate the cost of 10 candies. Since one candy costs $0.80, the cost for 10 candies is 10 * $0.80 = $8.00.
4. Finally, to find the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we add the cost of lollipops and candies: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00.

Therefore, the final answer is: \boxed{The total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00}.</s>","Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.

                [/INST] First, let's determine how many coins Neil has been saving per month. According to the question, Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins than Rong. Since Rong has been saving 20 coins per month, we can calculate Neil's savings as follows:

Neil's savings per month = Rong's savings per month * (1 + 2/5)
= 20 coins * (5/5 + 2/5)
= 20 coins * (7/5)
= 28 coins

Now, to find out how many coins they have saved fifteen months after they started, we need to calculate the total amount of coins each of them has saved after 10 years (or 120 months).

Total coins saved by Rong after 10 years = Rong's savings per month * 120 months
= 20 coins * 120 months
= 2400 coins

Total coins saved by Neil after 10 years = Neil's savings per month * 120 months
= 28 coins * 120 months
= 3360 coins

Finally, to find out how many coins they have together after 10 years, we simply add their individual savings:

Total coins saved by both after 10 years = Rong's total savings + Neil's total savings
= 2400 coins + 3360 coins
= 5760 coins

So, \boxed{5760} is the total number of coins they have saved ten years after they started saving.</s>","Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong, a total of 2/5*20 = <<2/5*20=8>>8 more coins.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines**: John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20. So, the total cost for vaccines is:
\[2 \times 20 = \$40\]

2. **Calculate the cost of the heartworm check**: The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Since the total bill is the sum of the cost of vaccines and the heartworm check, we can represent the total bill as \(V + H\), where \(V\) is the cost of vaccines and \(H\) is the cost of the heartworm check. Therefore, we can write:
\[H = 0.6 \times (V + H)\]
\[H = 0.6 \times (\$40 + H)\]
\[0.4H = \$24\]
\[H = \$60\]

3. **Calculate the total cost**: Now, we add the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check to find the total cost:
\[\$40 + \$60 = \$100\]

4. **Calculate how much John leaves with**: John brought $125 with him. If the total cost is $100, then the amount he leaves with is:
\[\$125 - \$100 = \$25\]

Therefore, John leaves with $\boxed{\$25}$.</s>","The vaccines cost 40 because 2 x 20 = <<2*20=40>>40

How many points is the class : missing to ? go ; on the trip if the minimum threshold is : 400 points?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points) = 50 + (0.3 * 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points = Betty's points - 30 = 65 - 30 = 35 points.
4. Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta's points = Tom's points + (3 * Tom's points) = 35 + (3 * 35) = 35 + 105 = 140 points.
5. Now, let's add up the points collected by Adam, Betty, Tom, and Marta: 50 + 65 + 35 + 140 = 290 points.
6. The minimum threshold for going on the trip is 400 points. So, the class is missing 400 - 290 = 110 points to go on the trip.

Final answer: \boxed{110}</s>","Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.

1. First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account, so:
   Retirement contribution = Paycheck * 50%
   = $2400.00 * 0.50
   = $1200.00

2. Next, let's calculate her car payment. She uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment, so:
   Car payment = Paycheck * 20%
   = $2400.00 * 0.20
   = $480.00

3. Now, let's calculate how much money she has left after funding her retirement and paying for her car. This is the amount she has left to spend:
   Money left to spend = Paycheck - (Retirement contribution + Car payment)
   = $2400.00 - ($1200.00 + $480.00)
   = $2400.00 - $1680.00
   = $720.00

So, the final answer is:

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many pencils are currently in the box. According to the question, the box originally holds 20 pencils and 4 are missing. So, the number of pencils currently in the box is 20 - 4 = 16 pencils.

2. Now, we want to find out how many pairs of 2 pencils can be made from the 16 pencils. To do this, we need to divide the number of pencils by the number of pencils in each pair and then round down to the nearest whole number (since we can't have a fraction of a pair).

So, the number of pairs of pencils is 16 / 2 = 8 pairs.

1. The city has 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, the total number of fireworks in the city is 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks.

Next, let's calculate how many fireworks Hannah will see from her house.
2. Hannah will see 40% of the city's fireworks. So, the number of fireworks Hannah will see from her house is 40% of 300, which is 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

Now, let's calculate how many fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard.
3. Hannah will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Number of People**: Aiden and his 12 friends, plus the 7 new friends they met up with. So, the total number of people is $12 + 7 + 1 = 20$ people.

2. **Total Number of Seats**: Since each person requires a seat, and there are 20 people, there are $20$ seats in total.

3. **Total Drinks and Snacks per Seat**: Each seat has room for 2 drinks and 3 snacks. Therefore, for 20 seats, the total number of drinks and snacks is $2 \times 20 = 40$ drinks and $3 \times 20 = 60$ snacks.

4. **Total Items (Drinks + Snacks)**: Adding the total number of drinks and snacks together gives us $40 + 60 = 100$ items in total.

5. **Cost per Item**: Both drinks and snacks cost $2 each. So, the cost for each item is $2$.

6. **Total Cost**: Multiplying the total number of items by the cost per item gives us the total cost. That is, $100 \times 2 = 200$ dollars.

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to determine how much Gordy's truck can carry. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which can carry 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:
   Gordy's truck capacity = Gissela's truck capacity + 800 pounds
   = 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds
   = 4,800 pounds

2. Next, we know that when Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can carry 11,600 pounds of gravel. So, to find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:
   Gary's truck capacity = Total capacity - (Gissela's truck capacity + Gordy's truck capacity)
   = 11,600 pounds - (4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds)
   = 11,600 pounds - 8,800 pounds

3. The total number of dumplings eaten by males is therefore 8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings.

4. The total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings.

5. The total number of dumplings eaten by everyone is 32 dumplings (from males) + 18 dumplings (from females) = 50 dumplings.

6. Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked all 50 dumplings.

                [/INST] First, let's understand the relationship between the cat's speed and the turtle's speed. The cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. This means if the cat runs at 15 feet/second, the turtle's speed would be 1/5th of that, because the cat is 5 times faster.

Step 1: Cat's speed = 15 feet/second

Step 2: Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5 = 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second

Now, we know the turtle's speed per second, but we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds.

Step 3: Distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds = Turtle's speed * Time = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds

Final Step: The turtle can crawl = 120 feet in 40 seconds.

2. Next, we're told that 80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes. This means that the remaining 20% of the water they use is for non-industrial purposes. This is because percentages are relative, so 100% - 80% = 20%.

3. Now, we want to find out what percent of the river's total water this non-industrial use represents. Since 20% of the city's water use is for non-industrial purposes and the city uses 40% of the total river water, we multiply these two percentages together: 40% * 20% = 8%.

So, the final answer is that Colorado City uses {8%} of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.</s>","First find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes: 100% - 80% = 20%

1. Each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50.

2. Erin has $6.00.

3. For every 2 scoops bought, she gets 1 scoop free.

4. So, with $6.00, she can buy 2 + 1 = 3 scoops, with two of them being paid and one being the free one.

5. However, since one scoop is free, the cost for those 3 scoops would be for 2 paid scoops, which is $1.50 * 2 = $3.

6. Now, Erin has $3 left, which she can use to buy more ice cream.

7. With the remaining $3.00, she can buy 2 more scoops, as there's a deal that for every 2 scoops bought, she gets 1 scoop free.

8. Again, since one scoop is free, the cost for those 2 scoops would be $1.50 * 1 = $1.50.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate how much candy each person eats in a week.

For Ginger: She eats 4 pieces a day, so in a week (7 days), she eats 4 * 7 = 28 pieces.

For Amy: She eats 3 pieces a day, so in a week, she eats 3 * 7 = 21 pieces.

They each start with 100 pieces, so after a week, Ginger has 100 - 28 = 72 pieces left, and Amy has 100 - 21 = 79 pieces left.

Now, let's calculate how much candy each person eats in two weeks.

For Ginger: In two weeks, she eats 28 (first week) + 28 (second week) = 56 pieces. So, she has 72 - 56 = 16 pieces left.

For Amy: In two weeks, she eats 21 (first week) + 21 (second week) = 42 pieces. So, she has 79 - 42 = 37 pieces left.

1. Calculate the cost of picking:
   James has to pay $20 to go picking and then an additional $1.5 per pound.
   He picked 30 pounds of blueberries.
   So, the total cost of picking = $20 (going to the location) + $1.5 * 30 (for each pound) = $20 + $45 = $65.

2. Calculate the cost of buying:
   The cost of buying blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound.
   James picked 30 pounds, so the cost of buying = $2.5 * 30 = $75.

3. Find out how much James saved:
   James saved = Total cost of buying - Total cost of picking = $75 - $65 = $10.

                    question:

If she dances a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised during only 2 of those minutes, what would be the combined total number of times , that she taps both of her feet?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to determine the number of taps each foot makes independently. When Helga has her arms down:
   - Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute.
   - Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
   - Combined, they tap 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

2. Next, we need to consider the time with her arms raised. When Helga has her arms up, both feet tap at 200 taps per minute.

3. Now, let's calculate the total number of taps for each scenario:
   - With arms down for 3 minutes (since she raises her arms for 2 minutes during the 5-minute dance), she makes 550 taps per minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.
   - With arms raised for 2 minutes, she makes 200 taps per minute * 2 minutes = 400 taps.

4. Finally, we add the taps from both scenarios to find the combined total number of taps for the entire dance: 1650 taps + 400 taps = 2050 taps.

{The final answer is 2050 taps.}</s>","During the 5 minutes of dancing, 2 minutes were performed with hands raised and 5-2=3 minutes were performed without hands raised.
With hands not raised, her right foot tapped 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 times.
With hands not raised, her left foot tapped 3*250=<<3*250=750>>750 times.
With hands raised, her right foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.
With hands raised, her left foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.
Thus, in total, she tapped 900+750+400+400=<<900+750+400+400=2450>>2450 times

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the cost of the three buckets of asphalt.
The cost of one bucket is $25, so the cost of three buckets is 3 * $25 = $75.

Next, let's consider the potential damage to Ron's car if the pothole isn't fixed. The potential damage is $450.

Ron will also have to pay a fine of $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself.

Now, let's compare the cost of fixing the pothole and the potential damage to Ron's car.

The total cost of fixing the pothole is the cost of the asphalt and the fine, which is $75 + $120 = $195.

If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, the cost could be as high as $450 due to potential damage to his car.

Therefore, by fixing the pothole, Ron saves $450 - $195 = $255.

So, the final answer is \boxed{255}.</s>","First find the total cost of the asphalt by multiplying the number of buckets by the cost per bucket: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $<<3*25=75>>75
Now subtract the cost of the asphalt and the fine from the cost of the damage Ron avoids: $450 - $75 - $120 = $<<450-75-120=255>>255

The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs.

Step 2: Calculate the number of normal chairs that were sent for repair.
20 % of the normal chairs were sent for repair, so we need to find 20 % of 170.
20% of 170 = (20/100) * 170 = 34

Step 3: Calculate the total number of chairs that were sent for repair.
34 normal chairs + 13 baby chairs = 47 chairs

Step 4: Calculate the remaining number of chairs.
Total number of chairs at the restaurant = 170 normal chairs + 23 baby chairs = 193 chairs
Number of chairs sent for repair = 47 chairs
So, the remaining number of chairs = Total number of chairs - Number of chairs sent for repair
= 193 chairs - 47 chairs = 146 chairs

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. Each person ordered one pizza, and each pizza has 12 slices.
2. So, in total, there are 5 pizzas, and that means 5 x 12 = 60 slices of pizza.

Bryce and his first two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, so:
1. Each of these three people had 12 slices, so 2/3 of 12 slices is (2/3) x 12 = 8 slices.
2. Since there are three of them, that's 3 x 8 = 24 slices eaten.

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas:
1. Each of these two people had 12 slices, so 3/4 of 12 slices is (3/4) x 12 = 9 slices.
2. Since there are two of them, that's 2 x 9 = 18 slices eaten.

Now, let's add up how many slices were eaten in total:
1. The first three friends ate 24 slices, and the last two friends ate 18 slices.
2. So, in total, 24 + 18 = 42 slices were eaten.

Finally, let's find out how many slices were left:
1. There were 60 slices in total, and 42 slices were eaten.
2. So, 60 - 42 = 18 slices were left.

So, the final answer is \boxed{18} slices were left.</s>","Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.
Of the 60 total slices of pizza, the friends ate 42, and 60 slices – 42 slices = <<60-42=18>>18 slices of pizza were left.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we start by calculating how long it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. Given that the dog can eat the same number of sausages in \(2/3\) the amount of time the cat takes, we can set up the calculation as follows:

- The cat takes \(30\) minutes to eat the sausages.
- The dog takes \(2/3\) of the time the cat takes, which is \(2/3 \times 30\) minutes.

Performing the calculation:
\[2/3 \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}\]

Now, we have the time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages:
- The cat takes \(30\) minutes.
- The dog takes \(20\) minutes.

To find the average time they take to eat the sausages, we add the times together and divide by the number of animals (which is 2 in this case):
\[\frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is $\boxed{25}$ minutes.</s>","If the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes 2/3*30 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 minutes.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Convert Topher's shoe length to inches:**
   Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, we can convert 8 feet to inches as follows:
   - 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
   Adding the 4 inches to this gives us:
   - 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

2. **Set up the equation:**
   The problem states that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. So, if we denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as b (in inches), we can write the equation as:
   - 100 inches = 9b + 10

3. **Solve for b:**
   Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:
   - 90 inches = 9b
   Dividing both sides by 9 gives us:
   - b = 10 inches

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. Therefore, the final answer is:

{The length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.}</s>","Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.
Subtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90
Solving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10

If there are 64 students' cars with four windows each and 32 teachers' cars with two windows : each, how many windows does Hannah smash?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we will break it down into smaller, manageable steps.

First, let's calculate the total number of windows on the students' cars:
- Each student car has 4 windows.
- There are 64 student cars.
So, the total number of windows on student cars is $4 \times 64 = 256$ windows.

Next, we calculate the total number of windows on the teachers' cars:
- Each teacher car has 2 windows.
- There are 32 teacher cars.
So, the total number of windows on teacher cars is $2 \times 32 = 64$ windows.

Now, we find out how many windows Hannah smashed on the students' cars:
- She smashed a quarter of the students' car windows.
- There are 256 windows on the students' cars.
So, the number of windows she smashed on students' cars is $256 \times \frac{1}{4} = 64$ windows.

Then, we calculate how many windows Hannah smashed on the teacher's cars:
- She smashed three-quarters of the teachers' car windows.
- There are 64 windows on the teacher cars.
So, the number of windows she smashed on teacher cars is $64 \times \frac{3}{4} = 48$ windows.

Finally, we add the windows smashed on both types of cars to find the total number of windows Hannah smashed:
- On students' cars, she smashed 64 windows.
- On teachers' cars, she smashed 48 windows.
So, the total number of windows she smashed is $64 + 48 = 112$ windows.

1. First, we need to determine how many pieces of gum Parker chews in 30 days. Since he chews 4 pieces a day, we multiply 4 (pieces of gum) by 30 (days), which equals 120 pieces of gum in total.

2. Next, we need to figure out how many packs of gum this equates to. We know that each pack contains 15 pieces of gum. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we divide the total number of pieces of gum by the number of pieces in each pack.

1. Multiply the number of kids by the number of smores each kid wants. This will be the total number of smores needed for the kids:
   9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores

2. Add this to the total number of smores needed for the adults. We know that each adult wants 1 smore, and there are 6 adults:
   18 smores + 6 adults * 1 smore/adult = 18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores

3. Now, each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores. So, let's find out how many sleeves are needed to make enough smores for everyone:
   24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

4. But, there are 3 sleeves in a box. So, the number of boxes needed will be the number of sleeves needed divided by the number of sleeves in a box:

                    Dora's father's age is eight more . than twice Dora's age. If Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, and Dora is 15 years old, calculate the total combined age of Dora, her , father, and ; her mother.
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that Dora is 15 years old.

2. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate Dora's father's age:
   Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
   Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 years old.

3. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we calculate Dora's mother's age:
   Mother's age = Father's age - 4
   Mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years old.

4. Now, we want to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. So, we add up their ages:
   Total age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
   Total age = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years old.

So, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years old.</s>","If Dora's age is 15, her father, with eight more than twice Dora's age, is eight more than 15*2 = <<15*2=30>>30 years.
This means Dora's father is 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.
Together, Dora and her father have a total age of 38+15 =<<38+15=53>>53.
Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, meaning Dora's mother is 38-4 = 34 years old.
Altogether, Dora's family has a total age of 53+34 = <<53+34=87>>87 years.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Candidate A got 20% of the votes. If there were 100 voters, then candidate A got 20/100 * 100 = 20 votes.

2. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. So, candidate B got 20 votes + (50% of 20 votes) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

3. The total votes are divided among the three candidates. So, the votes candidate C got are the total votes minus the votes of candidates A and B.

4. Candidate C got = Total votes - (Votes of candidate A + Votes of candidate B) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 votes.

Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples. So, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Step 2: Determine how many apples Beck has after receiving 10 apples from Boris.
Beck initially has 77 apples, and receives 10 more from Boris. So, Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

Step 3: Determine how many apples fewer Beck has than Boris now.
Boris still has 100 apples, and Beck now has 87 apples. So, Beck has 100 - 87 = 13 apples fewer than Boris now.

Final answer: \boxed{13}</s>","Boris has 100 apples, but gives 10 away, so now he has 100 apples - 10 apples = <<100-10=90>>90 apples.
Beck has 23 fewer than Boris at the start, so he started with 100 - 23 = <<100-23=77>>77 apples.
However, since he gets 10 from Boris, he now has 77 apples + 10 apples = <<77+10=87>>87 apples.

If he makes 3 giant cubes, 7 medium cubes, and ; 8 small cubes, how many ounces of , water does he have left?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we will calculate the amount of water used for each type of ice cube and then subtract the total amount of water used from the initial 32 ounces to find out how much water Peter has left.

1. For the giant cubes:
Peter makes 3 giant cubes, and each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. So, the total amount of water used for giant cubes is:
3 (giant cubes) * 4 (ounces per cube) = 12 ounces

2. For the medium cubes:
Peter makes 7 medium cubes, and each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. So, the total amount of water used for medium cubes is:
7 (medium cubes) * 2 (ounces per cube) = 14 ounces

3. For the small cubes:
Peter makes 8 small cubes, and each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water. So, the total amount of water used for small cubes is:
8 (small cubes) * 1/2 (ounce per cube) = 4 ounces

Now, add up the total amount of water used for all types of ice cubes:
12 (for giant cubes) + 14 (for medium cubes) + 4 (for small cubes) = 30 ounces

Finally, subtract the total amount of water used from the initial 32 ounces to find out how much water Peter has left:
32 (initial ounces) - 30 (total ounces used) = 2 ounces

   - A gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar.
   - A gallon jar costs $5.

2. **Finding the Cost of a Half-Gallon Jar**:
   - Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar and a gallon jar costs $5, a half-gallon jar costs $5 - $2 = $3.

3. **Calculating the Total Cost**:
   - The cost of 10 gallon jars is 10 * $5 = $50.
   - The cost of 16 half-gallon jars is 16 * $3 = $48.

These 35 students like either to play video games or music.

According to the information given, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who prefer playing basketball:

2 * 5 students (basketball) = 10 students (music)

So, there are 10 students who like to play music. This means the rest of the 35 students must like to play video games:

35 students - 10 students (music) = 25 students

1. We know that there are 2 classes and the total number of students in both classes is 80.

2. Since each class has the same number of students, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2.
   Number of students in each class = Total number of students / Number of classes
   = 80 / 2
   = 40 students

3. We are also told that each class has 40% girls. This means that the remaining students in each class must be boys, as the total percentage must add up to 100%.
   Since 40% of the students are girls, 60% must be boys.

4. To find the number of boys in each class, we can calculate 60% of the number of students in each class.
   Number of boys in each class = 60% of number of students in each class
   = 0.6 * 40
   = 24 boys

So, the final answer is:

   - Mark bought 3 packs of cards, with each pack costing $1800.
   - Therefore, the total cost is $3 \times 1800 = \$5400$.

2. **Calculate the total value of the cards Mark sold:**
   - Mark sold 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000.
   - Additionally, there were 30 more cards, each worth an average of $50.
   - The total value of these 30 cards is $30 \times 50 = \$1500$.
   - Adding the value of the first two cards, the total value becomes $1500 + 4000 + 1000 = \$6500$.

3. **Calculate the profit Mark made:**
   - Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total value of the cards sold.
   - Therefore, the profit Mark made is $6500 - 5400 = \$1100$.

Thus, the final answer, encapsulated as requested, is $\boxed{\$1100}$.</s>","The cheaper cards are worth a total of 30*50=$<<30*50=1500>>1500
So all the cards together are worth 1500+4000+1000=$<<1500+4000+1000=6500>>6500
The cost for the cards was 1800*3=$<<1800*3=5400>>5400
So he made a profit of 6500-5400=$<<6500-5400=1100>>1100

The first . amusement park has a $26 fee for each adult and a $12 fee for each child; while the ; second , amusement park has a $14 fee for each adult and $10 for each child. If . there ? are 2 adults and 2 children in their family, how much will they be able to save ? if they choose the second amusement park over the first?
                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park. We have 2 adults and 2 children. So, the cost for the first amusement park will be:

Cost for the first amusement park = (Cost for an adult * Number of adults) + (Cost for a child * Number of children)
= ($26 * 2) + ($12 * 2)
= $52 + $24
= $76

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park. Again, we have 2 adults and 2 children. So, the cost for the second amusement park will be:

Cost for the second amusement park = (Cost for an adult * Number of adults) + (Cost for a child * Number of children)
= ($14 * 2) + ($10 * 2)
= $28 + $20
= $48

Now, let's calculate the difference in cost between the two amusement parks to find out how much they can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first:

Difference in cost = Cost for the first amusement park - Cost for the second amusement park
= $76 - $48
= $28

But we want to know how much they can save, not just the difference in cost. Since Jake's family would be spending less money by choosing the second amusement park, the amount they can save is also $28.

{The final answer is} $28.</s>","The two adults pay $26 x 2 = $<<26*2=52>>52 for the first amusement park.
While the two children's tickets cost $12 x 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24 for the first amusement park.
So, they will pay a total of $52 + $24 = $<<52+24=76>>76 for the first amusement park.
The two adults pay $14 x 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28 for the second amusement park.
While the two children's tickets for the second amusement park cost $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.
So, they will pay a total of $28 + $20 = $<<28+20=48>>48 for the second amusement park.
Thus, they will save $76 - $48 = $<<76-48=28>>28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.

                [/INST] To calculate the weekly savings, we follow these steps:

1. **Daily Savings Calculation**: The tomato vendor used to buy tomatoes at $0.5

75. With the new vendor, the price is $0.40. The daily savings can be calculated as the difference in price per tomato.
   \[
   \text{Daily savings per tomato} = 0.575 - 0.40 = 0.175
   \]

2. **Weekly Savings Calculation**: To find out the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings per tomato by the number of tomatoes sold daily and then by the number of days in a week.
   \[
   \text{Weekly savings} = 0.175 \times 500 \times 7 = 595

                [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We know that Sean has 56 marbles.
2. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.
3. We also know that Sean has half as many marbles as Carl, but since we already know Sean has 56 marbles, this information is redundant.
4. Now, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, Cal must have twice as many marbles as Sean. So, Cal has 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.
5. Finally, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their individual amounts of marbles together. So, Carl has 224 marbles and Cal has 112 marbles.
6. Therefore, Carl and Cal have a combined total of 224 + 112 = 336 marbles.

                [/INST] To find out how many chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented each day for two weeks (4 weeks) and then multiply that by two.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays.
There are 5 weekdays in a week, so in 4 weeks, there will be 5 * 4 = 20 weekdays.
Chairs rented during weekdays = Number of chairs rented per weekday * Number of weekdays
= 60 * 20
= 1200 chairs

Step 2: Calculate the number of chairs rented during weekends.
There are 2 weekend days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there will be 2 * 4 = 8 weekend days.
Chairs rented during weekends = Number of chairs rented per weekend day * Number of weekend days
= 100 * 8
= 800 chairs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months.
Total chairs rented = Chairs rented during weekdays + Chairs rented during weekends
= 1200 + 800
= 2000 chairs

Since there are two 4-week months, Candy will be able to rent out 2 * 2000 = 4000 chairs in total.

Final answer: \boxed{4000}</s>","During weekdays, a total of 60 x 5 = <<60*5=300>>300 chairs are rented.
During the weekends, a total of 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200 chairs are rented.
In a week, 300 + 200 = <<300+200=500>>500 chairs are rented.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, 500 x 4 = <<500*4=2000>>2000 chairs are rented in a month.
Thus, a total of 2000 x 2 = <<2000*2=4000>>4000 chairs are rented in two months.

1.Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas hidden under a fern branch.
2.When Gunther wasn’t looking, Arnold, the chimpanzee, stole half of the bananas. So, (48/2)=24 bananas were stolen by Arnold.
3.Remaining bananas in Gunther’s pile are, 48 - 24 = 24 bananas.
4.The next day, Gunther added another 25 bananas to his pile. So, 24(remaining)+25(new bananas) = 49 bananas in the pile.
5.Later that evening, Arnold stole another 12 of the bananas. So, 49 - 12 = 37 bananas remained in the pile.
6.On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile. So, 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

The final answer is: \boxed{43}.</s>","Half of 48 bananas is 48/2=<<48/2=24>>24 bananas.

Starting with the remaining 24 bananas, adding 25 bananas to the pile brings the total to 24+25=<<24+25=49>>49 bananas.
Arnold's second act of thievery resulted in 49-12=<<49-12=37>>37 bananas remaining.
Gunther adds another 6 bananas, resulting in the final number of 37+6=<<37+6=43>>43 bananas.

1. Jenna has 4 roommates. This means there are 5 people in total who have to share the electricity bill.

2. The total electricity bill is $100 per month.

3. To find out how much each person has to pay per month, we divide the total bill by the number of people:
   Monthly payment per person = Total bill / Number of people
   Monthly payment per person = $100 / 5
   Monthly payment per person = $20

4. To find out how much each person has to pay per year, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months in a year:
   Yearly payment per person = Monthly payment per person * Number of months in a year
   Yearly payment per person = $20 * 12
   Yearly payment per person = $240

Therefore, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity. {The final answer is: $240}</s>","There are 12 months in a year, so the total electricity for the year will cost 100*12 =$<<100*12=1200>>1200.

1. Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded for large buttons = 90% of 30 = 0.9 * 30 = 27
   - Since each large button is worth three small stickers, the number of large buttons Lorraine gets = 27 / 3 = 9

3. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and the rest for small buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded for large buttons = 50% of 40 = 0.5 * 40 = 20
   - Number of large stickers traded for small buttons = 40 - 20 = 20
   - Since each large sticker is worth one large button, the number of large buttons Lorraine gets from trading large stickers = 20

1. We know that there are 33 people on the council.
2. The question states that the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x.
3. Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation would be 2x, according to the problem.
4. Since there are only two sides to the vote (in favor and against), and all votes must be either in favor or against, we can say that the total number of votes on the council must equal the sum of the votes in favor plus the votes against. In other words, 33 = x + 2x.
5. Combining like terms, we get 33 = 3x.
6. Solving for x, we find that x = 11. This means there were 11 votes against the new regulation.
7. Substituting x back into the equation for the votes in favor, we get 2x = 2 * 11 = 22.

The final answer is that there were 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.</s>","Let V be the number of votes against the new regulation.
There were twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation, so V + 2V = 3V = 33.
Thus, there were V = 33 / 3 = <<33/3=11>>11 votes against the new regulation.
Therefore, there were 2V = 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

   So, the number of students needing size M = number of students needing size S - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18 students.
4. Half as many students need size large (L) as size medium
   So, the number of students needing size L = (number of students needing size M) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9 students.
5. Six more students need size extra-large (XL) than size large
   So, the number of students needing size XL = number of students needing size L + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15 students.

Now, let's add up all the students to find out how many shirts Krissa ordered:

Total students = students needing XS + students needing S + students needing M + students needing L + students needing XL
               = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15
               = 75 students.

So, Krissa ordered \boxed{75} shirts.</s>","Krissa ordered 11 x 2 = <<11*2=22>>22 size small.

                [/INST] The first step is to calculate the discount amount. Since the bag has a 5% discount, we can multiply the original price by 5% (or 0.05) to find the discount amount.
$140 * 0.05 = $7

The second step is to subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price.
$140 - $7 = $133

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into clear, step-by-step calculations:

1. First, we need to find the total number of songs in the 20 playlists. Since each playlist has 300 songs, we multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist:
   Total songs = Number of playlists * Songs per playlist
   Total songs = 20 * 300
   Total songs = 6000

2. Next, we need to calculate the total duration of these songs. Each song is 10 hours long, so we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song:
   Total duration = Total songs * Length of each song
   Total duration = 6000 * 10
   Total duration = 60000 hours

So, the total duration of the 20 playlists is 60,000 hours.

The final answer is {60,000 hours}.</s>","Since each playlist has 300 songs, the total number of songs in the 20 playlists is 20*300= <<20*300=6000>>6000.

1. We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win the race. To find out how many people that is, we calculate 20/100 * 50 = 10 people.

2. Next, we need to find out how many people are left after taking out the 10 people who think horse #2 will win. So, 50 - 10 = 40 people remain.

3. Now, we know that 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win the race. To find out how many people that is, we calculate 60/100 * 40 = 24 people.

4. After taking out the 24 people who think horse #7 will win, we are left with 40 - 24 = 16 people. These are the people who think horse #12 will win the race.

2. That means there are 3 * 6 = 18 Pomeranian puppies in total.
3. We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. So, the total number of Jana's puppies is 1.5 times the number of Pomeranian puppies (since two thirds of Jana's puppies is equal to the number of Pomeranian puppies).

3. The third house needs double the amount needed by the first house. So, the third house needs 2x cases of shingles.

4. The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can set up an equation: x + 2x + 2x = 250.

5. Solving this equation gives us x = 50. So, the first house needs 50 cases of shingles.

                    Tatiana is ; deciding how much of her weekend ! she wants to spend , playing soccer. She has 7 hours ? on Saturday and 5 hours on ! Sunday. She is dividing her time between soccer, video games, and reading. If she reads for 3 hours and plays video games . for 1/3 of the remaining time, what percentage of her weekend does she spend playing soccer?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much time Tatiana spends playing soccer out of her total weekend time.

First, let's calculate her total weekend time:
7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Then, let's calculate how much time she spends on video games. She reads for 3 hours, so the time left for video games and soccer is:
12 hours (total) - 3 hours (reading) = 9 hours

She spends 1/3 of this time on video games:
1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

So, the time left for soccer is:
9 hours (video games + soccer) - 3 hours (video games) = 6 hours

Now, we calculate the percentage of the weekend she spends playing soccer:
(6 hours (soccer) / 12 hours (total)) * 100% = 50%

So, the final answer is:
\boxed{50\%}</s>","She has 12 hours for her activities because 7 + 5 = <<7+5=12>>12
After reading, she has 9 hours left because 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9
She spends 3 hours playing video games because 9 x (1/3) = <<9*(1/3)=3>>3
After video games she has 6 hours left for soccer because 9 - 3 = <<6=6>>6
The proportion of time spend on soccer is .5 because 6 / 12 = <<6/12=.5>>.5
The percentage of time spent on soccer is 50 because .5 x 100 = <<50=50>>50

1. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. So, Anthony gave away 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils to Brandon.

2. This leaves Anthony with 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

3. Then, Anthony gave 3/5 of these 25 pencils to Charlie. So, Anthony gave away 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils to Charlie.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Jack to travel to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

1. First, let's calculate the time it takes Jack to travel to the museum. The formula for time is distance / speed. So, the time it takes to drive to the museum is 150 miles / 75 mph.

2. This simplifies to 150/75 = 2 hours. So, it takes Jack 2 hours to drive to the museum.

3. Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, the total time he is away from home before going back home is 6 hours (spent at the museum) + 2 hours (to drive to the museum).

4. This simplifies to 6 + 2 = 8 hours.

5. Finally, we need to add the time it takes Jack to drive back home. Since the distance is the same (150 miles) and he drives at the same speed (75 mph), it will take him another 2 hours to drive back home.

6. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is 8 hours (spent at the museum and driving to the museum) + 2 hours (driving back home).

7. This simplifies to 8 + 2 = 10 hours.

So, Jack is gone from home for \boxed{10} hours.</s>","He drove a total of 150+150=<<150+150=300>>300 miles

1. Calculate the total number of wheels Henry will need for the cars. He needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels for the cars is 4 * 57 = 228 wheels.

2. Calculate the total number of wheels Henry will need for the motorcycles. He needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels for the motorcycles is 2 * 73 = 146 wheels.

3. Calculate the total number of wheels Henry will need in total. This is the sum of the number of wheels he needs for the cars and the motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels Henry will need is 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

4. Calculate the number of wheels left after assembly. Henry starts with a box containing 650 wheels. He uses 374 wheels to assemble the toys. So, the number of wheels left is 650 - 374 = 276 wheels.

Final answer: \boxed{276}</s>","The total number of wheels needed for all the cars is 57 cars x 4 wheels/car = <<57*4=228>>228 wheels

The problem is asking for the price of a laptop after a 20% discount. The initial price of the laptop is $1000.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of the discount in dollars.
To calculate the amount of the discount, we need to find 20% of $1000.
20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Step 3: Calculate the price of the laptop after the discount.
To find the price of the laptop after the discount, we subtract the amount of the discount from the initial price.
Price after the discount = Initial price - Amount of the discount
Price after the discount = $1000 - $200 = $800

The final answer is:

                [/INST] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. Mike has 600 movies.
2. A third of the movies are in various series, so:
   600 / 3 = 200 movies in series.

3. Mike can get those movies in series for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie.
   So, if a normal movie costs $10, then he will pay:
   $6 for each series (200 movies in series).

4. The remaining movies are not in series, so:
   600 - 200 = 400 normal movies.

5. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so:
   $400 * 40% = 160 older movies.

6. Those older movies cost $5 each, so the cost for the older movies is:
   160 * $5 = $800.

7. The rest of the normal movies (400 - 160 = 240 movies) are regular priced at $10 each, so the cost for the regular movies is:
   240 * $10 = $2400.

8. Adding up the costs for the series, older movies, and regular movies, the final cost is:
   ($6 / movie in series * 200 movies in series) + $800 (older movies) + $2400 (regular movies)
   = $1200 + $800 + $2400

1. Peaches: Winston picked 6 pounds at a cost of $2.00 per pound. Therefore, the cost for peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00/pound = $12.00.

2. Plums: Winston picked 8 pounds at a cost of $1.00 per pound. Therefore, the cost for plums is 8 pounds * $1.00/pound = $8.00.

3. Apricots: Winston picked 6 pounds at a cost of $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the cost for apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00/pound = $18.00.

Now, we add up the costs for each type of fruit to find the total cost:

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the time spent driving and hiking separately.
The family spent 6 hours on their journey, so for the hike:
Time spent hiking = Total time - Time spent driving
Time spent hiking = 6 hours - Time spent driving

Step 2: Calculate the driving time.
They drove an average of 50 miles per hour, and it took 1.5 hours to hike at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive. So, their driving time can be calculated as follows:
Time spent driving = (Distance driven / Driving speed) + Time spent hiking

Step 3: Calculate the hike speed.
Half of their driving speed is:
Half of driving speed = Driving speed / 2
Half of driving speed = 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour

Their hike speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed:
Hike speed = Half of driving speed - 5 miles per hour
Hike speed = 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour

Step 4: Calculate the distance of the hike.
Distance of the hike = Hike speed * Time spent hiking
Distance of the hike = 20 miles per hour * 1.5 hours

Step 5: Calculate the distance driven.
Distance driven = Driving speed * Time spent driving

Step 6: Calculate the total distance (distance driven + distance of the hike).
Total distance = Distance driven + Distance of the hike

The final answer is {The final answer is the total distance, which you need to calculate following steps 2 to 6}.</s>","Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.

If Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 : more berries, but finishes the level 4 ? seconds , slower, what ! is the difference between their two scores?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. Let's denote Ava's score as A and Emma's score as E. We know that:

A = 10 \* (Enemies Ava jumped on) + 0.5 \* (Berry Ava collected) + 30 \* (Time Ava left on)

2. Similarly, Emma's score E can be represented as:

E = 10 \* (Enemies Emma jumped on) + 0.5 \* (Berry Emma collected) + 30 \* (Time Emma left on)

3. According to the problem, Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, collects 3 more berries, but finishes 30 seconds slower. So we can write:

Enemies Ava jumped on = Enemies Emma jumped on + 8

Berry Ava collected = Berry Emma collected + 3

Time Ava left on = Time Emma left on - 30

4. Now, we substitute these expressions into the score equations:

A = 10 \* (Enemies Emma jumped on + 8) + 0.5 \* (Berry Emma collected + 3) + 30 \* (Time Emma left on - 30)

E = 10 \* (Enemies Emma jumped on) + 0.5 \* (Berry Emma collected) + 30 \* Time Emma left on

5. Simplify the equations:

A = 10Enemies Emma jumped on + 80 + 0.5Berry Emma collected + 1.5 + 30Time Emma left on - 900

E = 10Enemies Emma jumped on + 0.5Berry Emma collected + 30Time Emma left on

6. Now, to find the difference between their scores, subtract E from A:

Difference = A - E

Difference = (10Enemies Emma jumped on + 80 + 0.5Berry Emma collected + 1.5 + 30Time Emma left on - 900) - (10Enemies Emma jumped on + 0.5Berry Emma collected + 30Time Emma left on)

7. Simplify further:

Difference = 80 - 900 + 1.5

Difference = -818.5

8. Since it's not possible to have a negative score, we take the absolute difference:

Difference = |-818.5| = 818.5

So, the difference between their two scores is 818.5 points.

The final answer is {818.5}.</s>","For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.
For collecting berries, Emma earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 fewer points than Ava.

1. First, we calculate the number of rides Chase and Rider do on their usual days. They ride thrice a day for 5 days, so that's 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. So, that's 2 * 3 rides = 6 rides each of those days. Since there are two such days, that's 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. Adding the rides from the usual days and the days they ride twice, we get 15 rides (usual days) + 12 rides (twice days) = 27 rides.

4. Since there are 7 days in a week, this 27 rides is the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white.

2. Bob bought 17 fish from a mixed tank, which contains both orange and white fish. We don't know the exact number of orange and white fish in the mixed tank, but we do know that the total number of fish he bought was

17. When he added these 17 fish to his pond, he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish.

3. Let's denote the number of orange fish bought from the mixed tank as x and the number of white fish bought as 17 - x.

4. After adding these new fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish becomes (3 + x) and the total number of white fish becomes (4 + 17 - x) = (21 - x).

5. According to the problem, the total number of orange fish is now twice the total number of white fish. So, we can write the equation: (3 + x) = 2 * (21 - x).

6. Solving this equation gives us: 3 + x = 42 - 2x. Rearranging terms, we get: 3x = 42 - 3. Therefore, x = 13.

7. So, Bob bought 13 orange fish from the mixed tank. This means he bought (17 - 13) = 4 white fish from the mixed tank.

\boxed{4}</s>","Bob started with 7 fish and bought seventeen, so he had 7 + 17 = <<7+17=24>>24 fish.
Let x = the number of white fish.
Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so 2*x + x = 24 fish
3*x = 24
x = 24/3 = <<24/3=8>>8 white fish.
Bob started with 4 white fish, so he bought 8 - 4 = 4 white fish at the store.

                    Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG (miles per gallon). If the : current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, how much ? money is Andy's car consuming per week if : he only uses his car to go to work from ? Monday to Friday and the one-way distance between his home . and office is 5 miles?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we'll break it down into smaller, manageable steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance traveled per week**: Andy travels to work and back every day, so the distance for one-way travel is 5 miles. For a round trip (to and from work), the distance is 5 miles \* 2 = 10 miles. Since he works from Monday to Friday, the total distance traveled in a week is 10 miles/day \* 5 days = 50 miles.

2. **Calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week**: Given that Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 MPG, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed by dividing the total distance traveled by the car's fuel efficiency. So, the fuel consumed per week is 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.

3. **Calculate the total cost of fuel per week**: The current price of regular gas is $3/gallon. Therefore, the total cost of fuel per week is the amount of fuel consumed multiplied by the price per gallon, which is 5 gallons \* $3/gallon = $15.

So, the final answer, encapsulating it as requested, is \boxed{15}.</s>","Between Monday to Friday there are 5 days
If the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles the total round trip distance Andy drives daily is 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 miles
That means he drives a total of 10 miles * 5 days = <<10*5=50>>50 miles per week
If his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, then his car is consuming a total of 50 miles / 10 MPG = <<50/10=5>>5 gallons of gas each week
Given that each gallon of gas costs $3, then his car is consuming 5 * $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 worth of gas each week

                [/INST] First, let's convert the amount of money Carrie has into cents for easier calculation.

Twenties are worth 20 dollars each, and we have 10 of them, so that's 10 * 20 = 200 dollars.
Quarters are worth 25 cents each, and we have 140 of them, so that's 140 * 25 = 3500 cents.

Now, let's convert the dollars Carrie has into cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, and she has 200 dollars, so she has 200 * 100 = 20000 cents.

The total amount of money Carrie has is 3500 cents (quarters) + 20000 cents (twenties) = 23500 cents.

Carrie spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties. So let's calculate how many dollars of twenties she spent.

3/5 of 200 dollars is (3/5) * 200 = 120 dollars.

So, the amount of money Carrie spent is equivalent to the amount of quarters she had (because she spent all of them and used part of the twenties) plus the 120 dollars she spent from the twenties.

In cents, this is 140 * 25 (quarters) + 120 * 100 (dollars) = 3500 + 12000 = 15500 cents.

So, the final answer is {The total amount of money she paid for the lunch is 15500 cents}.</s>","Since she spent all the quarters, she paid her lunch partly by quarters totaling 140*$0.25 = $<<140*0.25=35>>35
She also used 3/5*10 = <<3/5*10=6>>6 of the twenties to pay for the lunch.
The total amount of the twenties that she used is 6*$20 = $<<6*20=120>>120
She spent $120+$35 = $<<120+35=155>>155 on the lunch.

22 tomatoes/plant * 5 plants = 110 tomatoes

2. Calculate the number of eggplants:
Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants and Ricardo has planted 8 eggplant plants. So, the total number of eggplants is:

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the fraction of sales that are OLED TVs and then multiply this by the total number of TVs sold.

1. The fraction of sales that are OLED TVs can be calculated by subtracting the fractions of sales that are smart TVs and analog TVs from 1 (since the fractions must add up to 1).

Fraction of OLED TVs = 1 - (Fraction of smart TVs + Fraction of analog TVs)
   = 1 - (1/4 + 1/8)
   = 1 - (2/8 + 1/8)
   = 1 - 3/8
   = 5/8

2. Now, we can calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying the total number of TVs sold by the fraction of OLED TVs.

Number of OLED TVs = Total TVs sold * Fraction of OLED TVs
   = 40 * 5/8
   = 25

So, Samwell's store was able to sell \boxed{25} OLED TVs.</s>","Samwell was able to sell 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 Smart TVs.

1. First, we need to calculate the temperature difference between the night and the day. If it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and the day's temperature was 45 degrees, then the night's temperature would be45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

2. Next, we need to calculate the temperature difference between the night's temperature and the freezing point of the pipes, which is 32 degrees. So, the temperature difference is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

3. Now, we need to find out how many degrees per wood log does Carson need to heat the house by to prevent the pipes from freezing. Since every log of wood he burns heats the house up by 5 degrees, we divide the temperature difference by the degrees each log raises the temperature: 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs.

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing. {The final answer is \boxed{4}}</s>","First find the night-time temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees

                    A company's HR hires 20 new employees every month to add to its ; total : workforce. . If the company's initial employee number is 200, and each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, calculate the total amount of money the company . pays to its employees after three months?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. The company initially has 200 employees.
2. Each month, they hire 20 new employees. After three months, the number of new employees hired is 20 * 3 = 60 employees.
3. So, the total number of employees after three months is the initial employees (200) plus the new employees (60) = 260 employees.
4. Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month.
5. Therefore, after three months, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees is the number of employees (260) times the monthly salary ($4000) times the number of months (3).

The calculation is as follows:
Total amount = Number of employees * Monthly salary * Number of months
= 260 * $4000 * 3
= $3,120,000

However, I can't put a dollar sign in a box like you requested, but the final answer is:

{The final answer is $3,120,000}</s>","If each month the company hire 20 new employees, the total number of employees in the company in the first month is 200 employees + 20 employees = <<200+20=220>>220 employees
If each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money paid by the employee to its workers in the first month is 220 employees * $4000/employee = $<<220*4000=880000>>880000
In the second month, 20 more workers are hired, bringing the total number of employees to 220 employees + 20 employees = 240 employees
The company pays a total of 240 employees * $4000/employee = $<<240*4000=960000>>960000 in wages for its employees in the second month.
When an additional 20 workers are hired in the third month, the total number of workers become 240 employees + 20 employees = <<240+20=260>>260 employees
In total, the company 260 employees * $4000/employee = $<<260*4000=1040000>>1040000 in wages on the third month.
The total amount of money the company pays to all its employees in the three months is $1040000 + $960000 + $880000 = <<1040000+960000+880000=2880000>>2880000

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time for each song and then add them together.

1. First, let's calculate the total time for ""Deck the Halls"". Since it's 150 seconds long and they plan to sing it twice, the total time for this song is 150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds.

2. Next, we calculate the total time for ""Jingle Bells"". Since it's 240 seconds long and they plan to sing it once, the total time for this song is 240 seconds * 1 = 240 seconds.

3. Finally, we add the total times for both songs to get the total caroling time. So, 300 seconds (Deck the Halls) + 240 seconds (Jingle Bells) = 540 seconds.

\boxed{540} seconds is the total caroling time.</s>","First find the total time the choir spends singing ""Deck the Halls"": 2 * 150 seconds = <<2*150=300>>300 seconds

Next, we calculate Billy's hourly wage after 2 months, when he received a raise of $0.50 per hour. That's $10.50 per hour.

Then, we calculate Billy's hourly wage on his first anniversary at work, when he received a raise of $1.00 per hour. That's $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Sally's starting salary. It's stated that her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10.50 per hour.

Since they both work 20 hours, we can calculate their earnings:

Billy's earnings = $11.50 * 20 = $230
Sally's earnings = $10.50 * 20 = $210

Finally, we calculate how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, by subtracting Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings:

Difference = $230 - $210 = $20

So, the final answer is that Billy will earn $20 more than Sally. {The final answer is $20}.</s>","Billy has a salary of $10+0.50+$1.00=$<<10+0.5+1=11.50>>11.50 per hour.
Sally is paid $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, for a total of $10+$0.50=$<<10+0.5=10.50>>10.50 per hour.
If Billy works 20 hours, he will be paid 20*$11.50=$<<20*11.5=230>>230
If Sally works 20 hours, she will be paid 20*$10.50=$<<20*10.50=210>>210.
Thus, if both work 20 hours, Billy will be paid $230-$210=$20 more.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of trees planted by students.
There are 40 classes and each class has 25 students. Therefore, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000 students.
Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000 trees.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of trees planted by teachers.
Each class has 3 teachers, so the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120 teachers.
Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240 trees.

Step 3: Add the total number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the final total.
The total number of trees planted is 1000 (from students) + 240 (from teachers) = 1240 trees.

With one tree planted per student, 1000 * 1 = <<1000*1=1000>>1000 trees are planted per student.
With 2 trees planted per teacher, 120 * 2 = <<120*2=240>>240 trees are planted per teacher.
Adding the trees planted by teachers and students, 1000 + 240 = <<1000+240=1240>>1240 trees will have been planted at the end of the campaign.

Total stuffed animals = Number of puppies + Number of koalas + Number of zebras + Number of frogs
= 3 + 5 + 2 + 4
= 14

Next, we need to determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy so that they make up 30% of her total collection.

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats that Bubbles needs to buy as x.

So, the equation can be written as:
x / (14 + x) = 1/3

To solve this equation, we first multiply both sides by (14 + x):

x = (14 + x) / 3

Then, we multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the denominator:

3x = 14 + x

Next, we subtract x from both sides:

2x = 14

Finally, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:

x = 7

So, Bubbles needs to buy 7 stuffed goats to make them 30% of her total collection.

Final Answer: \boxed{7}</s>","Let x = the number of stuffed goats.
The current number of stuffed animals are (puppies + koalas + zebras + frogs) or 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = <<3+5+2+4=14>>14 stuffed animals total.

                [/INST] Let's break this down:

1. Kris is playing for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since a week has 7 days, 2 weeks would be 2 x 7 = 14 days. So, Kris plays for 0.5 hours/day x 14 days = 7 hours in the first two weeks.

2. Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. That's 2 hours/day x 7 days = 14 hours in the third week.

3. So far, Kris has played for 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

4. The achievement requires a total of 30 hours. So, Kris still needs to play 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours to earn the achievement.

{The final answer is: 9 hours}</s>","Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.
So playing for half an hour every day means Kris will have played for 0.5 hours * 14 days = <<0.5*14=7>>7 hours.
Playing for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.

2. The second car is traveling at an average speed of 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will cover a distance of 70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles.

3. Since the second car started later and is moving faster, it is initially closer to the first car at the start. After the second car has passed the first car, the distance between them is the difference in the distance they have both traveled.

4. The distance between the two cars after 2 hours is the difference in the distances they have covered, which is 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles.

Finally, to find out how much James paid, we add the premium to the total cost without premium.

Total cost with premium = Total cost without premium + Premium
                                         = $900 + $270

3. The number of square inches Milo can cover with the glass chips he has is the total number of chips divided by the number of chips needed per square inch. So, he can cover 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

4. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. The number of square inches in a rectangle is the length times the height. So, we can represent the total area of the mosaic as L * 3, where L is the length of the mosaic in inches.

5. We know that the total area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, so we can set up the equation 12 = L * 3.

6. Solving for L, we get L = 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

Therefore, the final answer is {Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long}.</s>","Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.
With those, he can make 144 / 12 = <<144/12=12>>12 square inches of mosaic.
Thus, Milo can make his 3 inch tall mosaic 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students who drank 1.5 quarts.
The number of students is 4, and each drank 1.5 quarts. So, the total amount of tea drank by them is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students who drank 2 quarts.
The number of students is 16, and each drank 2 quarts. So, the total amount of tea drank by them is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of tea drank by all the students.
This is the sum of the amount of tea drank by the students in Step 1 and Step 2. So, the total amount of tea drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party.
We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left after all the students drank their share. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning was the sum of the amount of tea left and the amount of tea drank by all the students. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning is 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

Step 5: Convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons.
We know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. So, the total amount of tea in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is \boxed{12}.</s>","4 students drank 1.5 quarts = 4 * 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6 quarts
16 students drank 2 quarts = 16 * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 quarts
Students drank 6 + 32 quarts = <<6+32=38>>38 quarts
Students + tea left = 38 + 10 quarts = <<38+10=48>>48 quarts
48 quarts = 12 gallons

How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?
                [/INST] First, let's understand the problem. Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then ordered 100 more, making a total of 200 candies. He sold 150 of these.

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies ordered.

Total candies ordered = 200
Candies sold = 150

Remaining candies to be sold = Total candies ordered - Candies sold
= 200 - 150
= 50

However, Dale is only selling butterscotch candies. Since he had 100 butterscotch candies to start with (from his initial order), and he sold 150 butterscotch candies, this means he must have sold all 100 and then ordered 50 more to be able to sell 150.

So, Dale still needs to sell all of his remaining candies (in the subsequent order), which is 50 candies.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell \boxed{50} butterscotch candies.</s>","Dale starts off selling 100 butterscotch candies that he ordered, but ends up selling 150, 100 - 150 = <<100-150=-50>>-50 candies.

1. We start with 10 students on campus at the beginning of the year.

2. At the end of each month, the number of students doubles. So, at the end of January, the number of students would be 10 * 2 = 20 students.

3. At the end of February, the number of students would double again, so we have 20 * 2 = 40 students.

4. At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so we have 40 * 2 = 80 students.

5. At the end of April, the number of students would again double, so we have 80 * 2 = 160 students.

6. At the end of May, the number of students doubles once more, so we have 160 * 2 = 320 students.

7. The question asks for the number of additional students that have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

1. **Determine total branches climbed**: Felix made $105 in a week. If he charges $0.25 per branch, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total earnings by the charge per branch.
   \[
   \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Charge per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420
   \]

2. **Calculate branches climbed per day**: Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches climbed by 7 to find out how many branches Felix climbs each day on average.
   \[
   \text{Branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps given and calculate the number of petals for each set of flowers and then subtract the ones that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each set of flowers:

1. Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   Total petals = Number of flowers * Petals per flower
   Total petals = 3 * 5 = 15 petals

2. Rose picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   Total petals = Number of flowers * Petals per flower
   Total petals = 4 * 6 = 24 petals

3. Rose picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   Total petals = Number of flowers * Petals per flower
   Total petals = 5 * 4 = 20 petals

4. Rose picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   Total petals = Number of flowers * Petals per flower
   Total petals = 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up all these petals to find out how many petals there are in total before any are lost:
Total petals = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Next, Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so we need to calculate how many petals those flowers have:

1. Rose drops 1 flower with 5 petals: 5 petals

2. Rose drops 1 flower with 6 petals: 6 petals

3. Rose drops 1 flower with 4 petals: 4 petals

4. Rose drops 1 flower with 7 petals: 7 petals

Total petals dropped = 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals

Finally, we need to subtract the petals that were dropped from the total number of petals to find out how many petals are in the vase:
Total petals in the vase = Total petals - Total petals dropped
Total petals in the vase = 101 - 22 = 79 petals

So, {The final answer is}: 79 petals are on the flowers in the vase.</s>","Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.
Finally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.
Rose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.
But the wind blows 5+6+4+7=<<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals worth of flowers away.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean together. Each S'more uses one marshmallow, and they each made 9 S'mores, so they used a total of 9 + 9 = <<9+9=18>>18 marshmallows.

Next, let's add the 3 marshmallows they dropped on the ground to the 18 they used, giving us a total of 18 + 3 = <<18+3=21>>21 marshmallows that were either eaten or dropped.

Finally, we subtract this total from the original number of marshmallows to find out how many are left. So, 35 - 21 = <<35-21=14>>14 marshmallows are left.

Since John and DeSean are each responsible for half the remaining marshmallows (since the question implies they're splitting the marshmallows fairly), each kid gets half of 14, which is 7.

Therefore, each kid can have 7 more S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final answer is {The final answer is 7 S'mores for each kid}.</s>","They used up 21 marshmallows because 9 plus 9 plus 3 equals <<9+9+3=21>>21.

1. Jack plays for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
2. One friend plays for half as long as Jack, which is 10 minutes (20 / 2) for 1 quarter.
3. The second friend is worse than the first friend and plays for half as long as the first friend, which is 5 minutes (10 / 2) for 1 quarter.
4. The third friend is significantly better and plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 30 minutes (20 x 1.5) for 1 quarter.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them spends in one 4-hour playing session:

1. Jack's money spent = 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour / 20 minutes/game = 12 games
   Total money spent by Jack = 12 games * 1 quarter/game = 12 quarters

2. First friend's money spent = 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour / 10 minutes/game = 24 games
   Total money spent by the first friend = 24 games * 1 quarter/game = 24 quarters

3. Second friend's money spent = 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour / 5 minutes/game = 48 games
   Total money spent by the second friend = 48 games * 1 quarter/game = 48 quarters

4. Third friend's money spent = 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour / 30 minutes/game = 8 games
   Total money spent by the third friend = 8 games * 1 quarter/game = 8 quarters

Now, let's add up the money spent by all four of them:

Total money spent by all = 12 quarters (Jack) + 24 quarters (first friend) + 48 quarters (second friend) + 8 quarters (third friend)
Total money spent by all = 92 quarters

Since 4 quarters make 1 dollar, we divide the total number of quarters by 4 to get the total money in dollars:

Total money in dollars = 92 quarters / 4 quarters/dollar = 23 dollars

{The final answer is 23 dollars}</s>","Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour

                [/INST] Let's break this down:

1. We know that the salt scrub is made up of salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar.
2. Tanya makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. This means that the total weight of the salt scrub is 10 ounces.
3. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and therefore fragrance) as ""x"" and the amount of salt (and therefore sugar) as ""y"".
4. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. This means the amount of oil is 2x and the amount of salt is y. Also, since the salt is the same as the sugar, y is also the amount of sugar.
5. We also know that the total weight is 10 ounces. So, we have the equation: 2x + x + y + y = 10
6. Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x + 2y = 10
7. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, y = x. Substituting y for x in the equation, we get: 3x + 2x = 10, which simplifies to 5x = 10.
8. Solving for x, we find that x = 2.
9. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt. Since y (which is also the amount of salt) is 2, we find that the amount of oil is 2*2 = 4.

So, Tanya uses \boxed{4} ounces of oil.</s>","Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.
Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.
She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.
In all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.

   - So, the total cost for the goats is $500 \times 3 = $1500.

2. **Calculate the cost of the cows:**
   - Each cow costs $1500.
   - John buys 2 cows.
   - So, the total cost for the cows is $1500 \times 2 = $3000.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of goats and cows.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe initially has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe then sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 cars is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. After selling 8 cars, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left.

4. Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold. So he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

5. After giving away 16 cars, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars remaining.

So, the final answer is Joe remains with 16 cars.</s>","If Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has 2*20 = 40 cars.
He then sells 20/100*40=<<20/100*40=8>>8 cars from his car collection.
After selling 8 cars, Joe remains with 40-8=<<40-8=32>>32 cars.
Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother, a total of 2*8=<<2*8=16>>16 cars.
The number of cars that Joe has remaining after giving 16 cars to his mother is 32-16=<<32-16=16>>16

1. First, we need to calculate the total time Sandy walked on the first day. Since she walked for 8 hours, we convert this into minutes. We know that 1 hour equals 60 minutes, so:
   Total time on the first day = 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

2. Next, we calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day. She walked half as many hours as on the first day, so:
   Time on the second day = 480 minutes / 2 = 240 minutes

3. Finally, we add the time from both days to find the total time Sandy walked:
   Total time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day = 480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

So, the final answer is: {The final answer is 720 minutes.}</s>","If she walked half as many hours on the second day as the first day, she walked for 1/2*8 = <<8*1/2=4>>4 hours on the second day.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to find out how many tasks John does in a day. Since he does 30 cycles of work each day and each cycle consists of 5 different tasks, he does:
   Tasks in a day = Cycles per day * Tasks per cycle
   = 30 cycles * 5 tasks
   = 150 tasks

2. Next, we need to calculate how much he earns in a day. Since each task pays $1.20, his daily earnings would be:
   Earnings per day = Tasks per day * Earnings per task
   = 150 tasks * $1.20
   = $180

3. Finally, to find out how much he earns in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week:
   Weekly earnings = Earnings per day * Days per week
   = $180 * 7 days

1. First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages, and each package contains 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins.

2. Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages, and each package contains 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins.

3. Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food Kimberly bought than dog food, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food. So, 88 tins of cat food - 36 tins of dog food = 52 tins.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.</s>","The number of cat food tins that Kimberley has bought is 8 × 11 = <<8*11=88>>88.

                [/INST] Let's denote the number of cards that Becca has as B, Smendrick has as S, and PJ has as P. We know the following:

1. B = S + 12 (Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick)

2. S = 3P (Smendrick has three times the number of cards PJ has)

3. B + S + P = 341 (The total number of cards is 341)

Now, we can substitute the expressions for B and S from equations 1 and 2 into equation 3 to solve for P:

(S + 12) + S + P = 341

Since S = 3P, we can rewrite this as:

(3P + 12) + 3P + P = 341

Combining terms, we get:

7P + 12 = 341

Now, we can solve for P by subtracting 12 from both sides and then dividing by 7:

P = (341 - 12) / 7
P = 329 / 7
P = 47

Now, we know that PJ has 47 cards. Since Smendrick has three times the number of cards PJ has, Smendrick has:

S = 3 * 47
S = 141

However, the question asks for the number of cards Becca has, so we need to find B. Since Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick:

B = S + 12
B = 141 + 12
B = 153

Milly will receive 75% of the purchase price back:
\[ 75\% \times \$32 = 0.75 \times \$32 = 24 \]
Therefore, the net amount Milly will lose is:
\[ \$2.00 - \$24 = -\$22 \]

                [/INST] This problem tests our critical thinking and reasoning skills.

First, let us understand the monthly chocolate production Boris has. We are told that Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

Let's define the production of the first week, the second week, and the third week in terms of the given information.

First week: Boris produces 8,000 bars.

Second week: Boris produces half as much as the first week. So he produces 8000 * 0.5 = 4,000 bars.

Third week: Boris produces three times as much as the first week. So he produces 8000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now let's calculate the total chocolate bars Boris produced in the first three weeks: 8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, the remaining amount he needs to produce in the fourth week is:

Remaining amount = Total monthly production - Total production till now
= 50,000 - 36,000
= 14,000 bars

So, in the fourth week, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate.

{The final answer is: 14,000}</s>","In the second week, Boris produces 8,000/2 = <<8000/2=4000>>4,000 bars of chocolate.

1. **TikTok Videos**: Britany records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week. The total time spent on recording videos is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total time for TikTok videos} = 18 \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Writing Songs**: She spends 2 hours a week writing songs. To convert this into minutes, we use the conversion that 1 hour = 60 minutes:
   \[
   \text{Total time for writing songs} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Doing Makeup**: She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup. The total time spent on makeup is:
   \[
   \text{Total time for makeup} = 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total Weekly Time**: To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a week, we add up the time spent on each activity:
   \[

Then find how long Britany spending doing her makeup in a week: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes/week
Then add the time she spends on videos and song-writing to find the total time she spends on TikTok in a week: 72 minutes/week + 90 minutes/week + 120 minutes/week = <<72+90+120=282>>282 minutes/week
Then multiply the time spent per week by the number of weeks per month to find the total time spent per month: 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = <<282*4=1128>>1128 minutes/month

                [/INST] To determine the total cost for Angela's installation, we break down the cost into several components:

1. **Cost of Additional Mirrors and Chandeliers:**
   Angela has 6 mirrors and 2 chandeliers, and the firm offers to install additional items for an extra $15.00 per item. The cost for these additional items can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \$15.00 \times (6 + 2) = \$15.00 \times 8 = \$120.00
   \]

2. **Cost of Additional Pictures:**
   Angela also has 20 pictures that need to be installed. With the additional charge of $15.00 per picture, the cost for these can be calculated as:
   \[
   \$15.00 \times 20 = \$300.00
   \]

3. **Total Additional Cost:**
   Adding the costs for the additional mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures gives us the total additional cost:
   \[
   \$300.00 + \$120.00 = \$420.00
   \]

4. **Base Installation Cost:**
   The base installation cost, which includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, is given as:
   \[
   \$129.00

                [/INST] Let's start by determining how much Anthony has saved. We know that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00. Therefore, Anthony has saved:

$20.00 (Eva's savings) + $10.00 = \boxed{$30.00}$

Now, we need to find out how much Roy has saved. We know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much 40% is of Anthony's savings, we can calculate:

$30.00 (Anthony's savings) * 0.40 = \boxed{$12.00}$

So, Roy has saved $12.00 more than Anthony. Therefore, Roy's total savings is:

$30.00 (Anthony's savings) + $12.00 (Additional savings) = \boxed{$42.00}$

{The final answer is $42.00}

So, Roy has saved a total of $42.00.</s>","Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva who has $20.00 so he has 10+20 = $<<10+20=30.00>>30.00

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. So, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 inch = 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches high.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. So, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches high.

Therefore, the final answer is that Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high, which is equivalent to 40 feet high.</s>","If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.
Since Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4*1=<<4*1=4>>4 feet.
And since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami. then Naruto can lift a mountain 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 feet.

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the distance Mason traveled in the first part of his journey.
The distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. Here, the speed is 8 km/h and the time is 4 hours. So, the distance is 8 * 4 = 32 kilometers.

Step 2: Calculate the distance Mason traveled in the second part of his journey.
The distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. Here, the speed is still 8 km/h and the time is now 6 hours. So, the distance is 8 * 6 = 48 kilometers.

Step 3: Add the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance.
That is, 32 + 48 = 80 kilometers.

So, the final answer is \boxed{80}.</s>","If Mason travels for 8 miles in one hour, in four hours, he traveled for 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 miles.
After his rest, Mason traveled for another 6 hours, and since he was traveling at 8 miles per hour, he had traveled for 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 miles after the six hours.

                [/INST] Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to understand that the speed of the kangaroos does not matter because they are traveling at the same speed. So, we can't determine how many hours it will take for the four turtles if we don't know how long it takes for 3 kangaroos to cross the highway.

2. The problem provides us with a total time of 18 hours for 3 kangaroos to cross the highway. This total time is divided among the 3 kangaroos. So, each kangaroo takes approximately 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours to cross the highway.

3. Now, let's think about the speed of the turtles. They are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos. If a kangaroo can cross the highway in 6 hours, then a turtle (who is at half the speed) will take twice as long, which is 6 hours * 2 = 12 hours.

4. Finally, let's find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the highway. Since one turtle takes 12 hours, 4 turtles will take the same amount of time because they are also traveling at the same speed, so the answer remains 12 hours.

Therefore, the final answer is {12 hours}.</s>","If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed, a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, one kangaroo takes 18/3= <<18/3=6>>6 hours to cross the highway.
A turtle traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo will take 2*6 = <<2*6=12>>12 hours to cross the highway.
Four turtles will take a total of 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 hours to travel across the highway.

1. We know that Kora made 20 clay dishes.
2. The problem states that Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora. So, Rory made 20 dishes (Kora's amount) + 20 dishes = 40 dishes.
3. The problem also states that Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory. So, Jada made 2 * 40 dishes (Rory's amount) = 80 dishes.
4. To find out the total number of clay dishes they all made together, we add up Jada's, Rory's, and Kora's amounts: 80 dishes (Jada) + 40 dishes (Rory) + 20 dishes (Kora) = 140 dishes.

Therefore, the final answer is {140 clay dishes}.</s>","If Kora made 20 clay dishes, Rory made 20 clay dishes + 20 clay dishes = <<20+20=40>>40 clay dishes.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in the old one. The price of the new laptop is reduced by $200 when trading in the old one. So, the price Erika needs to pay is $600 - $200 = $400.

Next, let's calculate Erika's total savings. She has been paid $150 this week for her part-time job, and her mom agrees to give her $80. So, Erika has $150 + $80 = $230 in cash.

Finally, Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. So, the total amount of money Erika has is $230 + $50 = $280.

Therefore, \boxed{280} is the amount of money Erika has in her purse.</s>","Selling the old laptop reduced the cost of the new laptop to $600 – $200 = $<<600-200=400>>400 dollars.

Step 2: Determine how much more milk production the farmer needs to reach his target of 25 liters.
The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day, but his current production is only 15 liters. So, the additional milk production needed is:
25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters

Step 3: Determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce the additional milk.
Each cow can produce 5 liters of milk a day. So, to produce 10 liters a day, the farmer needs:

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. We start with the total length of each glue stick. Since a single glue stick is 12 millimeters long, we can assume that all three glue sticks were initially 12 millimeters each.

2. Next, we subtract the used portions from each stick:
   - The first stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used, meaning 12 - (5/6 * 12) = 12 - 10 = 2 millimeters not used.
   - The second stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used, meaning 12 - (1/3 * 12) = 12 - 4 = 8 millimeters not used.
   - The third stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used, meaning 12 - (1/2 * 12) = 12 - 6 = 6 millimeters not used.

3. Finally, we add up the lengths of the unused portions to get the total length of the glue sticks that are not used:
   - 2 millimeters (from the first stick) + 8 millimeters (from the second stick) + 6 millimeters (from the third stick) = 16 millimeters.

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters. {The final answer is: 16}</s>","The first glue stick has 12 x 1/6 = <<12*1/6=2>>2 millimeters left.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on squirt guns**: Craig buys six squirt guns at $2 each. The total cost for the squirt guns is calculated as follows:
   \[
   6 \times \$2 = \$12
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount spent on water balloons**: Craig buys three packs of water balloons at $3 each. The total cost for the water balloons is calculated as follows:
   \[
   3 \times \$3 = \$9
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent**: To find out how much Craig spent in total, we add the amount spent on squirt guns to the amount spent on water balloons:
   \[
   \$12 + \$9 = \$21
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount Craig had**: Craig originally had two twenty-dollar bills. The total amount he had is calculated as follows:
   \[
   2 \times \$20 = \$40
   \]

5. **Calculate the amount Craig has left**: To find out how much money Craig has left after his purchases, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount he had:
   \[
   \$40 - \$21 = \$19
   \]

Therefore, Craig has $\boxed{\$19}$ left after his purchases.</s>","Craig starts off with 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.
Craig spends 6 squirt guns * $2 = $<<6*2=12>>12 on squirt guns.
Craig spends 3 packs of water balloons * $3 = $<<3*3=9>>9 on water balloons.
Total Craig has spent $12 + $9 = $<<12+9=21>>21.
Craig has $40 - $21 = $<<40-21=19>>19 remaining.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of socks Jack has**:
   Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store. Given that Jack collected 60 dishes, we can determine the number of socks Jack has by dividing the number of dishes by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{\text{Number of dishes Jack has}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

2. **Determine the number of socks Peter has**:
   Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Since Jack has 30 socks, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying Jack's number of socks by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times \text{Number of socks Jack has} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of socks they have together**:
   To find the total number of socks they have together, we add the number of socks Jack has to the number of socks Peter has:
   \[
   \text{Total number of socks} = \text{Number of socks Jack has} + \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 30 + 60 = 90
   \]

4. **Determine the total number of dishes they have together**:
   Since we only know the number of dishes Jack has, and Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, we can determine the total number of dishes by adding the number of dishes Jack has to the number of dishes Peter has, which is half of Jack's number of dishes:
   \[
   \text{Total number of dishes} = \text{Number of dishes Jack has} + \frac{\text{Number of dishes Jack has}}{2} = 60 + \frac{60}{2} = 60 + 30 = 90
   \]

5. **Determine the total number of socks and dishes they have together**:
   To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the total number of socks to the total number of dishes:
   \[
   \text{Total number of socks and dishes} = \text{Total number of socks} + \text{Total number of dishes} = 90 + 90 = 180
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{180}

In total, he has 30+60 = <<30+60=90>>90 socks and dishes.
Peter has twice as many socks as jack which totals 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 socks.
He also has half times as many dishes as Jack which is 1/2*60 = 30 dishes.
In total, he has 60+30 = <<60+30=90>>90 socks and dishes.

                [/INST] Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that there are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students are good at English only.
4. The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

Since there are 20 students in total, the number of students who are good at both math and English is the remaining number after subtracting the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at English only.

So, the number of students who are good at both math and English is:

1. 20 (total students) - 5 (good at math only) - 8 (good at English only) = 7 (good at both math and English)

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math (both math only and both math and English), we add the students who are good at math only to the students who are good at both math and English:

2. 5 (good at math only) + 7 (good at both math and English) = 12 (good at math)

If she allows a 10-minute intermission, how many groups can perform in the concert?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage.
2. Each group performs for 6 minutes.
3. Each group takes 2 minutes to exit the stage.
4. There is a 10-minute intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time for a group to perform, including their setup and teardown:

Total time per group = Setup time + Performance time + Teardown time
= 2 minutes + 6 minutes + 2 minutes
= 10 minutes

Now, let's calculate how many groups can perform in 2 hours (120 minutes):

Number of groups = Total concert time / Time per group
= 120 minutes - 10-minute intermission / 10 minutes per group
= (120 - 10) minutes / 10 minutes
= 110 minutes / 10 minutes
= 11 groups

However, since the concert is scheduled for 2 hours (120 minutes), and the last group will perform at the end of the 2 hours, we don't need to account for the intermission when calculating the number of groups.

{The final answer is: 11}</s>","First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
Of those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 – 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances.
Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.
Of the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.

2. Since the interest is simple, it means the interest earned each year is not considered for the next year's interest.
3. We need to find the total amount Brenda has after 3 years.
4. The total amount will be the initial investment plus the total interest earned over 3 years.
5. The total interest earned over 3 years = 3 * $225 (since she earns $225 per year) = $675.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's determine the number of white shirts with collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, and there are 40 white shirts in total, then there are 40/2 = 20 white shirts with collars.

2. Since there are 40 white shirts in total and 20 have collars, then the number of white shirts without collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

3. According to the question, 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. Since we don't know how many of the floral shirts have no buttons, let's denote this number as X.

4. The total number of floral shirts is 50. So, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is X = 50 - 20 = 30.

5. Now, we can compare the number of white shirts with no collars (20) to the number of floral shirts with no buttons (30).

So, the number of more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars is 30 - 20 = 10.

1. First, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 2 by 12.

Number of shoes in a year = Pairs of shoes per month * Months in a year

                    question:
                    I am three years younger than my . brother, and I am 2 years ; older than my sister. My mom's age is one less than three . times my brother's age. When you add ! all our ages, you get 87. How old am I?
                [/INST] Let's use variables to represent the ages of each person:
Brother's age = B
Your age = Y
Sister's age = S
Mom's age = M

We know that:

1. (Y = B - 3)

2. (S = Y - 2)

3. (M = 3B - 1)

4. (Y + B + S + M = 87)

Now, substitute the equations from 1 and 2 into equation 4:

(Y + B + (Y - 2) + (3B - 1)) = 87
This simplifies to:
2Y + 4B = 89

Now, substitute Y from equation 1 into this equation:

2(B - 3) + 4B = 89
This simplifies to:
4B + 2B - 6 = 89
So, 6B = 95
B = 95 / 6 ≈ 15.83
But this value is not reasonable since ages should be whole numbers.

Let's double-check our calculations:

6B = 95
B = 95 / 6
B = 15.83333... (which is not a whole number, so our calculations must be incorrect)

After reviewing the problem and equations, it seems there was a mistake in step 3:

3. (M = 3B)

So, we get:

4. (Y + B + S + M = 87)
4. (Y + B + (Y - 2) + 3B) = 87
4. (2Y + 4B - 2) = 87
4. (2Y + 4B) = 89
4. (6B) = 89
4. B = 89 / 6 ≈ 14.83333... (which is not a whole number, so our calculations must be incorrect)

Now let's try to solve the problem by testing different possible ages for the brother (B):

1. If B = 14, then Y = B - 3 = 11, S = Y - 2 = 9, M = 3B = 42, and Y + B + S + M = 11 + 14 + 9 + 42 = 76 (not equal to 87)

2. If B = 15, then Y = B - 3 = 12, S = Y - 2 = 10, M = 3B = 45, and Y + B + S + M = 12 + 15 + 10 + 45 = 82 (not equal to 87)

3. If B = 16, then Y = B - 3 = 13, S = Y - 2 = 11, M = 3B = 48, and Y + B + S + M = 13 + 16 + 11 + 48 = 88 (not equal to 87)

It seems that there is a mistake in the problem statement or in the interpretation of the question. Please double-check the information and provide corrected values or additional context to help solve this problem.</s>","Let X be my age. My brother is X + 3 years old. My sister is X - 2 years old.
My mom is (X + 3) * 3 - 1 years old.
The sum of our ages is X + (X+3) + (X-2) + [(X+3)*3 - 1] = 87 years old.
Multiplying through the parentheses and combining like terms, you get X*6 + 9 = 87 years old.
Subtracting nine from both sides and dividing both sides by 6, you get X = 13 years old.

How many packs will ; Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he . can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

2. Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks, so we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks in each pack. This gives us 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.

3. However, Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs. Since he needs 6.75 packs, he will have to buy 7 packs to have enough glue sticks for his students.

4. Finally, we need to determine how many extra glue sticks Mr. Jackson will have. He will buy 7 packs, which contain 8 glue sticks each, for a total of 7 packs * 8 glue sticks/pack = 56 glue sticks. But he only needs 54 glue sticks. So, he will have 56 - 54 = 2 extra glue sticks.

So, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks, and he will have 2 extra glue sticks. {The final answer is: 7 packs of glue sticks and 2 extra glue sticks.}</s>","Mr. Jackson will need 27 x 2 = <<27*2=54>>54 glue sticks.
Divide the number of glue sticks by the amount in each pack, 54 / 8 = <<54/8=6.75>>6.75 packs.
Since Mr. Jackson must buy whole packs, you must round 6.75 up to the next highest whole number, 7.
Mr. Jackson must buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

1. The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. After one day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. So, the new amount of water is 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons.

3. On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. So, the new amount of water is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Since the volume of water increased by 6000 gallons on the third day, we add this to the amount of water after the first day of heavy rain, which resulted in 8000 gallons.

On day 2, these 60 people are now infected. Each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of people infected on day 3 is 6 * 60 = 360.

Now, we add the initial 10 infected people to the 360 from day 3. So, the total number of infected people is 10 + 360 = 370.

Therefore, the final answer is {370}.</s>","On the first day, the original ten people infect six people each, so 10 * 6 = <<10*6=60>>60 more people are infected.
There are 10 + 60 = <<10+60=70>>70 infected people after the first day.
On the second day, 70 * 6 = <<70*6=420>>420 more people are infected.

1. First, we calculate the amount Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the 40 customers gave her a $20 tip, the total amount she received is:
\[40 \times \$20 = \$800\]

2. Next, we need to find out how much Julieta received. It's given that she received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we calculate:
\[10\% \times \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80\]

3. To find Julieta's total tips, we subtract the amount that represents 10% less from Rafaela's total:
\[\$800 - \$80 = \$720\]

4. Finally, to find the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received altogether, we add their individual totals:
\[\$800 + \$720 = \$1520\]

Therefore, the total amount of tips Julieta and Rafaela received altogether is $\boxed{\$1520}$.</s>","The total amount of money that Rafaela received as tips from the forty customers is 40*$20 = $<<40*20=800>>800

1. First, we need to determine how many loaves of banana bread Paige can bake. Since she bakes every 4 hours, and she bakes from 1:00 PM - 6:00 PM, she will bake 4 times. Paige can bake 3 loaves each time, so in total, she bakes 3*4 = 12 loaves.

2. Next, we need to determine how many slices she can cut from these loaves. Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so from 12 loaves, she gets 12*8 = 96 slices.

1. We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S. Therefore, the number of gold coins would be S + 30.

2. We are given that if she had 70 gold coins, the question would have made more sense. But in this case, we have to assume that the number of gold coins she actually has is also 70 (since the number of gold coins in her hypothetical scenario is given as 70). So, S + 30 = 70.

3. Solving this equation for S, we get S = 70 - 30 = 40. So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

4. Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins together. That is, 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) = 110 coins.

1. **Calculate the number of burritos eaten by the students:** Since each of the 50 students was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos eaten by the students is calculated by multiplying the number of students by the number of burritos each student was given. This gives us:
   \[

   \]

3. **Determine the leftover burritos:** Since there were 600 burritos ordered and 520 were distributed (eaten by the students and Mr. George), the number of leftover burritos is found by subtracting the total number distributed from the total number ordered. This gives us:
   \[
   \text{Leftover burritos} = 600 - 520 = 80

   So, they have 10 green cars.

3. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so we multiply the number of green cars by 3 to find the number of blue cars:

   So, they have 30 blue cars.

4. We are given the total number of cars at the rink, which is

75. We already know the number of red, green, and blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

                [/INST] Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F. According to the problem, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has F - 12 books. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has (F - 12) + 25 books, which simplifies to F + 13 books.

The total number of books they have together is 85, so we can set up the following equation:

Fawn's books + Anne's books + Sofie's books = 85
F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Now, let's solve for F:

F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85
3F + 1 = 85
3F = 85 - 1

30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Next, we need to find out how many box of jello he needs to make 120 jello cups. Since one box makes 10 jello cups, he needs:

120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Now, we know the price of one box of jello is $1.25. So, to find out how much he will spend on jello, we multiply the number of boxes by the price per box:

12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. The cost of each phone is $700, so the total cost is $700 * 5 = $3500.

2. Next, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount of money the seller gave to the cashier. The seller gave $4000 in dollar bills, so we subtract the total cost of the phones: $4000 - $3500 = $500.

3. Therefore, the seller will give $500 back in change.

1. First, let's calculate how much Madeline pays per month. She pays 60% of the total $400, which is 0.6 * $400 = $240.

2. Since Madeline and Keenan share the cost equally, Keenan also pays $240 per month.

3. Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. There are four weeks in a month, so we divide the monthly amount he pays by the number of weeks: $240 / 4 = $60.

So, Keenan spends $60 per week.

                [/INST] Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, which is (2/5)*60 = 24 pieces.

2. On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So in total, after the second day, he has eaten 24 + 10 = 34 pieces.

3. On the third day, he ate the remaining pieces, which is 7/13 of the 60 pieces (since he ate 2/5 + 1/6 of the pizza on the first two days, leaving 15/13 of the pizza). So, he ate (7/13)*60 = 30 pieces on the third day.

4. Therefore, he has eaten a total of 34 (from the first and second day) + 30 (from the third day) = 64 pieces so far. But since he could not eat more than 60 pieces (as the pizza only had 60 pieces), there seems to be a mistake in the calculation.

Looking back at the calculation, it seems that the mistake was in the third step. The remaining pizza after the first two days is not 15/13 of the pizza, but 1 - (2/5 + 1/6) = 7/30 of the pizza. So, the correct calculation for the third day is (7/13)*(7/30)*60 = 14 pieces.

So, the correct answer is that Tobias has eaten 34 (from the first and second day) + 14 (from the third day) = 48 pieces of the pizza.

Final answer: {The pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is 48.}</s>","On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5*60 = <<2/5*60=24>>24 pieces of the pizza.
On the second day, Tobias ate 10 more pieces of the pizza, totaling 24+10 = <<24+10=34>>34 pieces
The number of pieces of pizza remaining is 60-34 = <<60-34=26>>26
On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13*26 = <<7/13*26=14>>14 pieces of pizza.

1. Cost of one bottle of soda:
   - Total cost of soda for 7 bottles = $21.00
   - Cost of one bottle of soda = Total cost of soda / Number of soda bottles = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00/bottle

2. Cost of one bottle of water:
   - Total cost of water for 4 bottles = $8.00
   - Cost of one bottle of water = Total cost of water / Number of water bottles = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00/bottle

3. Cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
   - Cost of 3 bottles of soda = Cost of one bottle of soda * Number of soda bottles = $3.00 * 3 = $9.00
   - Cost of 2 bottles of water = Cost of one bottle of water * Number of water bottles = $2.00 * 2 = $4.00

We know that Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. So, her hourly rate can be calculated as follows:

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours = $11 per hour

Now that we know Ella earns $11 per hour for walking dogs, we can calculate how much she would earn after 12 hours of dog walking:

The total amount Sarah will earn from selling the rope is 20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah's new rope will cost.

3. The store charges $1.5 for each meter.
4. Sarah needs 20 meters of rope.

So, the total cost for the new rope is 20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Finally, we find out how much money Sarah will have left after buying the new rope.

5. Sarah has earned $40 from selling the rope.
6. She spends $30 on the new rope.

So, the amount of money Sarah has left is $40 - $30 = $10

{The final answer is, Sarah will have $10 left over after she buys the new rope.}</s>","Her friend pays her $40 for the rope because 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40

1. In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, currently, Melanie's age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

2. We want to find the number of years T when Melanie's age will be thrice her current age, which is

3M.

3. Therefore, we can write the equation: M + T = 3M.

If , Kelly’s budget is $65 then how ! much ? money, in dollars, does she have left , in her budget?
                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of one pack of bacon.
Since 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10/5 = $2.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of one pack of chicken.
Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of one pack of chicken is 2*$2 = $4.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of 6 packs of chicken.
The cost of 6 packs of chicken is 6*$4 = $24.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of 3 packs of strawberries.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3*$4 = $12.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of 7 packs of apples.
The cost of one pack of strawberries is $4, so the cost of one pack of apples (half the price of a pack of strawberries) is $4/2 = $2. Therefore, the cost of 7 packs of apples is 7*$2 = $14.

Step 6: Calculate the total cost of all items in Kelly's cart.
The total cost of all items in Kelly's cart is the sum of the costs of the bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples. This is $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Step 7: Calculate the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget.
Kelly's budget is $65, so the amount of money she has left after grocery shopping is $65 - $60 = $5.

The final answer is \boxed{5}.</s>","Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.

Step 2: The final concert also includes a 15-minute encore, so its total length is 2x + 15 minutes.

Step 3: We know that the total length of the final concert is 65 minutes, so 2x + 15 = 65.

Step 4: To find the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to solve for x. Subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation gives 2x = 50.

Step 5: Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find x. So, x = 25.

**Step-by-step Solution**:
1. **Calculate the number of chimichangas made on Friday**:
   Since they make twice as many chimichangas on Friday as they do on Tuesday or Wednesday, we calculate this as:
   \[
   125 \times 2 = 250
   \]
   So, they make 250 chimichangas on Friday.

2. **Sum the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday**:
   We add the numbers of chimichangas made on each of these days:
   \[
   125 + 125 + 250 = 500

1. **Determine the number of microphones that will fit on the stage:**

The singer has a total of 50 microphones. However, 20% of these won't find any space to fit in. To find out how many that is, we calculate 20% of 50:
\[20\% \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10\]
So, 10 microphones won't fit on the stage.

2. **Calculate the number of microphones that will fit:**

Since 10 microphones won't fit, the number of microphones that will fit on the stage is:
\[50 - 10 = 40\]

3. **Pair the remaining microphones:**

The singer wants to arrange these 40 microphones in pairs. To find out how many pairs he can make, we divide the number of fitting microphones by 2:
\[40 \div 2 = 20\]

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

So, the final answer is:
\[\boxed{20}\]</s>","The number of microphones that were not able to find space on the stage is 20/100*50 = <<20/100*50=10>>10
This means the singer could set 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 microphones into pairs on the stage.
Since a pair has 2 microphones, the singer set up 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

1. First, we need to understand that Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes. This is a simple count, so no calculations needed here.

2. Jerry sees 2/3rd of the number of birds nesting in the bushes flying overhead. Since there are six birds nesting in the bushes, 2/3rd of this would be (2/3)*6 = 4 birds.

3. Jerry also sees 3 groups of eight birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds in this case, we multiply the number of groups (3) by the number of birds in each group (8). This gives us (3)*(8) = 24 birds.

Now, let's add up all the birds Jerry counted:

- Birds nesting in the bushes: 6
- Birds flying overhead: 4
- Birds feeding: 24

Adding these up gives us a total of 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 birds.

1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
2. We also know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. So, if we divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11, we'll find the speed of a thingamabob.
   Speed of a thingamabob = Speed of a whatchamacallit / 11
   = 121 meters per second / 11
   = 11 meters per second

3. Now, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. So, to find the speed of a whirligig, we can multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5.
   Speed of a whirligig = Speed of a thingamabob * 5

1. Let's denote the price of a carrot as C.

2. The price of a yogurt is half the price of a salad, which is $6, so a yogurt costs $3.

3. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day, so her daily expenditure is 2C + $6 + $3.

4. We know that in total, Ellen pays $11 for all her goods every day.

5. So, we can set up the equation 2C + $6 + $3 = $11.

6. Solving this equation for C gives us C = $11 - $6 - $3 / 2 = $1.50.

The final answer is \boxed{1.50}.</s>","Ellen's yogurt cost is half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.

                    question:
                    Last month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The first week, , she mowed Kamala's : lawn thrice as : many times as she did Joe's. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as ? she did Joe's. , If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, how much did she make from lemonade sales?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn in the first week as J.
2. According to the problem, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's. So, the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn in the first week is 3J.
3. In the following week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. So, the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn in the second week is 5J.
4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work on both lawns in that week (since the problem doesn't specify how much she was paid for each lawn).
5. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is $6.

Now, let's find out how much Tasha made from selling lemonade:

6. Tasha's total earnings last month were $80, and she earned $6 from mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from selling lemonade is $80 - $6 = $74.

Final answer: {The final answer is $\boxed{74}$}.</s>","At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars
Since the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.
Adding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars
Subtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars
Tasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

                [/INST] To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total hours John rents his car out in a month.**
   Since John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, the total hours he rents his car out can be calculated as:
   \[
   10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate John's total earnings from renting out his car.**
   Given that John gets paid $25 an hour for each rental, his total earnings for the month can be calculated by multiplying his hourly rate by the total hours he rents his car out:
   \[
   30 \times 25 = \$750
   \]

3. **Calculate John's profit.**
   To find out how much profit John makes, we subtract his car payment from his total earnings:
   \[
   750 - 500 = \$250
   \]

Therefore, the profit John makes on his car is $\boxed{\$250}$.</s>","He rents his car 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 hour a month
So he makes 25*30=$<<25*30=750>>750 a month
That means he has a profit of 750-500=$<<750-500=250>>250 a month

1. Joseph has 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Let's say Martha has M notebooks, so Joseph has 3M notebooks.
2. Martha then buys 0.5 more notebooks, making her total 7 notebooks. This means her original number of notebooks (M) was 7 - 0.5 = 6.5 notebooks.
3. So, Joseph had 3 * 6.5 = 19.5 notebooks.
4. Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 19.5 notebooks.
5. To find out how many more notebooks Joseph has than Martha, we subtract Martha's notebooks from Joseph's. That is, 19.5 - 7 = 12.5 notebooks.

So, the final answer is {Joseph has 12.5 notebooks more than Martha}.</s>","Since she bought 5 more to have 7, she originally had 7-5 = <<7-5=2>>2 notebooks

1. Dijana rowed 50 miles.
2. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To calculate this, we first find 1/5 of the distance Dijana rowed: 50 miles * (1/5) = 10 miles.
3. Then, we add this additional distance to the distance Dijana rowed to find out how many miles Anis rowed: 50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles.
4. To find the total distance the two of them rowed on that day, we add the distances they rowed individually: 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles.

The final answer is: The two of them rowed a total of 110 miles on that day. {The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$ miles}.</s>","Anis rowed for 1/5 * 50 = <<1/5*50=10>>10 more miles than Dijana.

3. Daniel did not read any pages today.

4. To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we add up all the pages Denise read (both yesterday and today) and subtract the total pages Daniel read yesterday.

So, Denise read 15 pages yesterday and 18 pages today, which is a total of 15 + 18 = 33 pages. Daniel read 13 pages yesterday.

1. Calvin has 2 bowls of soup, which are enough to fill four adult bowls. This means that 1 adults' bowl is equivalent to 0.5 bowls of soup.

2. Calvin, his adult wife, and their two children will be eating together for lunch. This means that there are 4 people in total.

3. If each person eats one bowl at a meal, then 4 bowls of soup are needed for the lunch.

4. Calvin has 2 bowls of soup for lunch, which are enough for 4 adults. Since each adult is equivalent to 0.5 bowls of soup, the total amount of soup is 4 adults * 0.5 = 2 bowls, which matches Calvin's amount.

5. Since the amount of soup is just enough for lunch, there won't be any leftover soup. Therefore, the children will not be able to have any more bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

\boxed{The final answer is: The children will not be able to have any more bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.}</s>","Four adult bowls equal eight children’s bowls, so each adult bowl is 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 children’s bowls.
Calvin and his wife will eat two adult bowls, so they will eat the equivalent of 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 children’s bowls.
Thus, he, his wife, and their children will eat 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 children’s bowls at dinner.
After dinner, there will be 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 children’s bowls left over.

First, let's find out how much material Jo needs for making a single small mask. She can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. So, for one small mask, she would need:

2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards

Now, let's find out how much material Jo needs for making a single large mask. She can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. So, for one large mask, she would need:

2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards

Now, we can calculate how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks:

0.5 yards/mask * 20 masks = 10 yards

And how much material Jo needs to make 8 large masks:

0.75 yards/mask * 8 masks = 6 yards

Finally, to find out how much material Jo needs in total, we add the amounts needed for small and large masks:

10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class.

{The final answer is 16 yards.}</s>","It takes 2 yards of material / 4 small masks = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 yards of material per mask.

For the small masks, it will take 20 masks x 0.5 yards = <<20*0.5=10>>10 yards of material.
For the large masks, it will take 8 masks x 0.75 yards = <<8*0.75=6>>6 yards of material.

                [/INST] First, let's find out how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Since Jamie gets 1/5 of the marbles, we calculate 1/5 of 30.
1/5 * 30 = 6

Now, we know that Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie and 10 marbles to Donald. So, we need to find out how many marbles are left for Dean.
To do this, we subtract the number of marbles given to Jamie and Donald from the total number of marbles Dean had initially.

30 (total marbles) - 6 (marbles for Jamie) - 10 (marbles for Donald) = 14

\boxed{14} marbles are left for Dean.</s>","Dean gives 30 x 1/5 = <<30*1/5=6>>6 marbles to Jamie.
He gives a total of 6 + 10 = <<6+10=16>>16 marbles in all.

                [/INST] Let's solve this step by step:

1. Eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.
2. At that time, Adam was half of that, which is 52 / 2 = 26 years old.
3. So, Adam was 26 years old four years ago.
4. Now, 8 years from now, Adam will be 26 + 4 + 8 = 38 years old.

The final answer is {Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years}.</s>","Eight years ago, Duncan was 60-8 = 52 years old, the same as Adam's age four years ago.
Therefore, four years ago, Adam's age was 52/2 =<<52/2=26>>26 years.
Currently, Adam is 26+4 = <<26+4=30>>30 years old.
In 8 years from now, Adam will be 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.

1. Calculate the area of Farmer Smith's farm:
   - First, we know that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.
   - Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the area of Farmer Brown's farm. So, we calculate twice the area of Farmer Brown's farm, which is 2 * 200 = 400 acres.
   - Then, we add 100 acres to get the total area of Farmer Smith's farm, which is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

2. Calculate the total area of both farms together:
   - We add the area of Farmer Brown's farm (200 acres) to the area of Farmer Smith's farm (500 acres).

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour

Next, we need to calculate how much money he earns in a typical eight-hour workday. He earns $0.20 for every package he completes, so in eight hours, he earns:

$0.20 * 40 packages/hour * 8 hours = $64

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how long it takes John to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle. Since it takes him 4 times as long as a normal Sudoku, which takes 45 minutes, the time taken for an extreme Sudoku is 4 * 45 = 180 minutes.

2. Next, we need to convert this time into half hours, as John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. We know that 1 hour = 2 half hours, so 180 minutes = 180 / 2 = 90 half hours.

3. Finally, since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, the number of bottles he drinks in 90 half hours is simply 90.

So, the final answer is {The final answer is 90 bottles}.</s>","He drinks a bottle of water every 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 minutes

Step 1: We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. So, the total number of pieces of bologna he threw at the red balloons is 2R and at the yellow balloons is 3Y.

Step 2: We also know that he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. So, we can write the equation:

2R + 3Y = 58

Step 3: We know that there are 20 red balloons, so R = 20. Substitute R in the equation:

2*20 + 3Y = 58
40 + 3Y = 58

Step 4: Solve for Y:

3Y = 58 - 40

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost for 1 dozen balloons is 6 balloons * $0.5/2 balloons = $1.5.
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.
4. The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $11 + $1.5 + $14 = $26.5.
5. Since Julia and Nadine decided to combine their allowances to afford all these items, and they bought equal shares, we can assume they split the total cost equally.

1. First, we need to find out how many lollipops were sold in total. Since each student sold 10 lollipops and there were 30 students, the total number of lollipops sold is:
   Total lollipops = Students * Lollipops per student
   = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student
   = 300 lollipops

2. Next, we need to find out how much money was made from selling these lollipops. Each lollipop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

3. Now, we need to find out how much money was spent on buying the lollipops. Each lollipop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:
   Total cost = Total lollipops * Cost per lollipop
   = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop

4. The profit is then the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. So, the profit is:

3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. His collection of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets Larry has, we add up the number of each type of pet:

$10 - 0.5 = 9.5$
years

Since she collects one shell per month, we can calculate the total number of shells she will have collected by the end of her 10th year by multiplying the number of years by 12 (the number of months in a year):
$9.5 \times 12 = 114$
shells

\boxed{114}</s>","In 12 months of the year, Martha collects 12 * 1 = <<12*1=12>>12 shells.
From her 5th to her 10th birthday, 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 years have passed.
During the 5 years that have passed, Martha has collected 12 * 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 shells.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups of tea.

2. **Chamomile and mint tea**: She divides these into 3 rows, and in each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea. This means that in each row, half of the tea cups are chamomile and half are mint.

3. **Cinnamon tea**: After arranging the chamomile and mint tea, she uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

Now, let's calculate the number of cups of mint tea in each row:

1. **Total cups of chamomile and mint tea**: Since she has 27 cups of tea in total and she brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, she has 27 - 15 = 12 cups left for chamomile and mint tea.

2. **Cups of mint tea in each row**: Since the chamomile and mint tea are divided equally into 3 rows, we divide the remaining cups by 3. So, she has (12 / 3) = 4 cups of mint tea in each row.

{The final answer is \boxed{4}} cups of mint tea in each row.</s>","If there are 15 cups of cinnamon tea, then there are a total of 27 – 15 = <<27-15=12>>12 cups of chamomile or mint tea.
As there are equal amounts of chamomile tea and mint tea, there is a total of 12 cups / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cups of mint tea.
Dividing these into rows shows that each row holds 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 cups of mint tea.

1. **Calculate the time spent per trip**: The sloth spends 4 hours for a single trip down the tree, picking berries, and climbing back up.

2. **Determine the number of trips in 8 hours**: 
   - Total time available = 8 hours.
   - Time per trip = 4 hours.
   - Number of trips = Total time / Time per trip = \( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \).

3. **Calculate the least number of berries per trip**: 
   - Total berries needed = 24.
   - Number of trips = 2.
   - Berries per trip = Total berries / Number of trips = \( \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \).

1. The pool initially contains 10,000 gallons of water.
2. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10,000 = 5,000 \) gallons of water.
3. They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden.
4. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.

To find out how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to calculate the total amount of water used over 6 days and subtract it from the initial amount in the tank.

Total water used over 6 days = 500 gallons/day × 6 days = 3,000 gallons

Remaining water in the tank after 6 days = Initial water in the tank - Total water used

Popcorn: 2 tubs * $8 = $16
Candy: 4 boxes * $2 = $8
Total: $16 + $8 = $24

Now, we subtract this amount from his monthly budget.

$150 - $24 = $126

Next, let's find out how much more he can spend on movie tickets. He has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday and 8 movies on other days. That's a total of 5 + 8 = 13 movies.

Now, let's calculate how much money he has spent on these 13 movies.

First 5 movies (Frid or Saturday): $10 * 5 = $50
Next 8 movies (Other days): $7 * 8 = $56
Total spent on movies: $50 + $56 = $106

Now, let's subtract this amount from the remaining amount he has for movies.

$126 - $106 = $20

Since tickets cost $10 on Fridays and Saturdays, he can see exactly 2 more movies this weekend.

1. On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so that's 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
3. On Wednesday, she also removed the same amount as on Tuesday, so that's another 78 Junebugs.
4. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
5. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we add all these up to find the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:

39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday) + 78 (Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 310 Junebugs

The total number of days is 5.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem:

1. First, we calculate the distance the bus traveled. Speed is equal to distance divided by time, so we rearrange this to find distance (distance = speed * time). The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so:

Distance_bus = Speed_bus * Time_bus
    = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
    = 300 miles

2. Next, we calculate the distance the car traveled. Again, using the formula distance = speed * time:

Distance_car = Speed_car * Time_car
    = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
    = 240 miles

3. Finally, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

Difference = Distance_bus - Distance_car
    = 300 miles - 240 miles
    = 60 miles

So, the bus traveled 60 miles more than the car. {The final answer is 60 miles}.</s>","The bus traveled 60 miles per hour * 5 hours = <<60*5=300>>300 miles.

1. First, let's identify the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls. She had:
   - Building blocks: 31
   - Stuffed animals: 8

   So, the total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is 31 + 8 + 9 = 48.

2. Then, after buying the tube of bouncy balls, her total number of toys became 62.

To find out how many bouncy balls are in the tube, we can subtract the total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys after buying them:

62 (total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls) - 48 (total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls) = 14.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1) P + A + J = 100
2) A = J + 10
3) P = A + J

We need to find P.

First, let's express A and P in terms of J using the second and third equations:
A = J + 10
P = A + J = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10

Now substitute these expressions into the first equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
3J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
3J = 80

Divide both sides by 3:
J = 80 / 3 ≈ 26.67

But the age must be a whole number, so let's re-check our calculations.

From 3J = 80, we should have rounded down J to 26 (since 26.67 is not a possible age).

Then, A = J + 10 = 26 + 10 = 36

And P = A + J = 36 + 26 = 62

So, the age of Peter is {62}.</s>","Let x be the age of John. Paul’s age is x + 10
Peter’s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10
We have (2x + 10) + (x + 1) + x = 100
Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100
Subtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.

Each table can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff, so on their 15 existing tables, they can fit 15 * 2 = 30 boxes.

Step 3: Determine how many additional boxes they can fit on their existing tables.
They have 20 boxes in total and can fit 30 boxes on their existing tables, so they don't need any new tables to fit their boxes.

                [/INST] To find the average total distance spit by both Zoey and Sydney, we follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Zoey spits. Since she has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet, the total distance she spits is:
\[40 \times 10 = 400\, \text{feet}\]

2. Calculate the total distance Sydney spits. She has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet, so the total distance she spits is:
\[35 \times 12 = 420\, \text{feet}\]

3. To find the average total distance spit by both, we add the distances together and divide by 2 (since there are 2 participants):
\[\frac{400 + 420}{2} = \frac{820}{2} = 410\, \text{feet}\]

Therefore, the average total distance spit by Zoey and Sydney is \(\boxed{410}\) feet.</s>","Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = <<40*10=400>>400
Sydney spits a total distance of 420 feet because 35 x 12 = <<35*12=420>>420
This totals to 820 feet because 400 + 420 = <<400+420=820>>820
The average total distance is 410 because 820 / 2 = <<820/2=410>>410

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can produce in a month. We know a month has 30 days and both machines run 24 hours a day.

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets/month
   WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets/month

2. Next, let's calculate how much money Fern will make from each machine. We know each widget sells for $6.

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
   WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

3. Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

Difference: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 than from the WidgetMaster 9000.</s>","First find how many more widgets the Widgeteer 3000 makes per hour: 60 widgets/hour - 45 widgets/hour = <<60-45=15>>15 widgets/hour
Then multiply that difference by the number of hours in a day to find the daily difference: 15 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = <<360=360>>360 widgets/day
Then multiply the daily difference by the number of days in a month to find the monthly difference: 360 widgets/day * 30 days/month = <<360*30=10800>>10,800 widgets/month

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the cost of Cameron's stay under the 24-hour option:

Cost for 12-hour stay = 1000 pesos
Cost for an additional 12 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next day) = 12 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 840 pesos

Total cost for a 24-hour stay = 1000 pesos + 840 pesos = 1840 pesos

Now, let's calculate the cost of Cameron's stay under the option he decided to go with:

Cost for 12-hour stay = 1000 pesos
Additional cost for staying from 5 pm to 10 am the next day = 12 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 840 pesos

Total cost for Cameron's stay under this option = 1000 pesos + 840 pesos = 1840 pesos

Since both options result in the same total cost of 1840 pesos, Cameron would not save any money.

{The final answer is: Cameron would not save any money.}</s>","12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.
If Cameron wants to leave at 10 am, he must pay for an additional 10 am - 5 am = <<10-5=5>>5 hours.
This means that he must pay an additional 70 pesos x 5 hours = <<70*5=350>>350 pesos.
Altogether, he must pay 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = <<1000+350=1350>>1350 pesos.
Therefore, he will save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = <<1600-1350=250>>250 pesos.

                [/INST] The problem can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Calculate the total hay needed for the goats:
Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Therefore, for 15 goats, Nate needs 5 * 15 = 75 pounds of hay.

2. Calculate the hay needed for one sheep:
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, the amount of hay needed for one sheep is 2 * 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

3. Calculate the total hay needed for the sheep:
Since there are 12 sheep and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay, Nate needs 7 * 12 = 84 pounds of hay for the sheep.

4. Calculate the total hay needed:
Nate needs 75 pounds for the goats and 84 pounds for the sheep. Therefore, the total amount of hay Nate needs is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

{The final answer is: 159 pounds}</s>","First figure out how much hay each sheep needs: 5 pounds * 2 - 3 = <<5*2-3=7>>7 pounds/sheep
Now figure out how much hay total the sheep need: 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = <<7*12=84>>84 pounds
Now figure out how much hay total the goats need: 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = <<5*15=75>>75 pounds
Now add the two amounts of hay to find the total: 84 pounds + 75 pounds = <<84+75=159>>159 pounds

1. First, let's calculate how much John earned in a week. He earns $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are $50 * 6 = $300.

2. Next, we need to account for John's expenses. He spends $50 on gas and wants to deposit $100 in the bank. So, his total expenses are $50 + $100 = $150.

3. Subtracting his expenses from his total earnings, we find out how much money he has left. That's $300 - $150 = $150.

4. Now, let's calculate the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he wants to buy 5 of them. So, the total cost of the pencils is $10 * 5 = $50.

5. Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the money he has left, we find out how much money he has left to spend on pens. That's $150 - $50 = $100.

6. Finally, let's calculate how many pens he can buy. Each pen costs $25 and he has $100 left. So, the number of pens he can buy is $100 / $25 = 4.

                [/INST] Let's start by calculating the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled.

Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:
20 words * 15 letters/word = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled 50 more letters than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:
300 letters + 50 letters = 350 letters

Now, let's calculate the total number of letters both Craig and his brother have spelled after the ten rounds.

                  = $150

Next, let's calculate the amount of the discount:

Discount = Total cost * Discount rate

3. After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, so he rests for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

4. James still has to swim the remaining 40% of the lake, which is 0.4 * 20 = 8 miles.

5. James is now going at half his usual speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

6. At this reduced speed, it takes him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours to swim the remaining distance.

7. The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the time spent swimming, resting, and swimming again. This is 6 hours (first swim) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (second swim) = 17 hours.

8. Therefore, the final answer is {17 hours}.</s>","He swam 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 miles.
That took him 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 hours.
So he rested 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours.
He then swam the remaining 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8 miles.
His pace was 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 mph.
So it took him 8/1=<<8/1=8>>8 hours.
So in total, he took 6+3+8=<<6+3+8=17>>17 hours.

                [/INST] To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculating the commission from the New York Times:**
   - The cost of each copy of the New York Times is $5.
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Therefore, the commission per copy from the New York Times is calculated as $5 \times 0.10 = \$0.5$.
   - Since he sells 6 copies, the total commission from the New York Times is $0.5 \times 6 = \$3$.

2. **Calculating the commission from the Wall Street Journal:**
   - The cost of each copy of the Wall Street Journal is $15.
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Therefore, the commission per copy from the Wall Street Journal is calculated as $15 \times 0.08 = \$1.2$.
   - Since he sells 10 copies, the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is $1.2 \times 10 = \$12$.

3. **Calculating the total commission:**
   - The total commission Cayley earns is the sum of the commissions from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.
   - Therefore, the total commission is $3 + 12 = \$15$.

Hence, the final answer, encapsulated as requested, is $\boxed{\$15}$.</s>","He gets a commission of 10% on each copy of the New York Times so for 6 copies he will get 6*$5*(10/100) = $<<6*5*(10/100)=3>>3

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. So, Marcus's age is 26 years - 5 years = 21 years.
3. Marcus is half of Leo’s age. This means Leo's age is twice Marcus's age. So, Leo's age is 21 years * 2 = 42 years.

                [/INST] Let's denote the number of points Azibo scored as A. According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's points can be represented as A + 20. Dinar scored 10 fewer points than Bahati, so Dinar's points are (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10.

The total points scored by the team is 45. So, we can write the equation as follows:

A (Azibo's points) + (A + 20) (Bahati's points) + (A + 10) (Dinar's points) = 45 (Total team points)

Solving this equation:

A + A + 20 + A + 10 = 45

1. We start with the fact that the book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch.
2. Each piece of paper is printed on both sides. So, each ""page"" in this context refers to two actual printed pages (one on each side of the paper).
3. The book is 1.5 inches thick. So, if we have 100 pages of printed paper in 1 inch, then for 1.5 inches, we would have 1.5 times 100 pages on one side of the paper, which is 150 pages.
4. However, since each page accounts for two sides (front and back), we need to multiply this number by 2.

The final step would be to multiply 150 pages by 2, which gives us 300 pages.

Therefore, the book contains 300 pages. {The final answer is: 300 pages}.</s>","There are 1.5*100=<<1.5*100=150>>150 pieces of paper.

Also, that day she woke up . 5 minutes earlier than usual . to go to the bathroom. How ; many ! minutes did she sleep on , her bed that day?
                [/INST] To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sleep time for that day**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is a duration of 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total sleep time as follows: $8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}$.

2. **Determine the time Kim woke up that day**: It is given that Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual. Therefore, her waking time that day was $6:00 - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55$ a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim spent sleepwalking**: The sleepwalking episode lasted from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. The duration of this period is $2:38 - 2:15 = 23 \text{ minutes}$.

4. **Calculate the time Kim did not sleep on her bed**: Since Kim woke up early and spent some time sleepwalking, the time she did not sleep on her bed is the sum of the early wake-up time and the sleepwalking time. The early wake-up time is $6:00 - 5:55 = 5 \text{ minutes}$, so the total time she did not sleep on her bed is $23 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes}$.

5. **Determine how long Kim slept on her bed**: To find out how long Kim slept on her bed, subtract the time she did not sleep on her bed (28 minutes) from the total sleep time (480 minutes). This calculation is as follows: $480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes}$.

Therefore, the final answer, encapsulated as requested, is $\boxed{452}$ minutes.</s>","Out of 24 hours in a day, 10 pm represents 22 hours.

                [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of measuring cups.
Jonathan has two dozen cups. A dozen is equal to 12, so two dozen would be 24.
{The number of measuring cups Jonathan has = 24}

Step 2: Determine the number of measuring spoons.
Jonathan has ! 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, the number of measuring spoons is 2/3 of the number of measuring cups.
{Number of measuring spoons = (2/3) * Number of measuring cups = (2/3) * 24 = 16}

Step 3: Determine the number of remaining measuring spoons after giving 6 to Pedro.
Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of remaining measuring spoons is the original number minus 6.
{Remaining measuring spoons = Original number - Given spoons = 16 - 6 = 10}

Step 4: Calculate the total number of utensils.
Total number of utensils is the sum of the number of measuring cups and the number of remaining measuring spoons.
{Total number of utensils = Number of measuring cups + Remaining measuring spoons = 24 + 10 = 34}

Final answer: {The final answer is \boxed{34}}</s>","A dozen measuring cups are 12, and if Jonathan has two dozens, he has 2*12 = 24 cups.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, let's find out how many beds are occupied initially. If 1/5 of the hospital's bed capacity is occupied, then:

Occupied beds = Total beds * (1/5)
   = 1000 * (1/5)
   = 200 beds

2. Now, let's calculate how many beds are newly occupied each day due to the coronavirus outbreak. This is given as 50 beds per day.

3. Over 2 weeks, the number of new admissions will be:

New admissions in 2 weeks = Daily admissions * Number of days in 2 weeks
   = 50 * 14
   = 700 beds

4. Adding these new admissions to the initially occupied beds, we find the total number of beds that would be occupied after 2 weeks:

Total occupied beds = Initially occupied beds + New admissions
   = 200 + 700
   = 900 beds

5. Finally, to find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

Unoccupied beds = Total beds - Total occupied beds
   = 1000 - 900
   = 100 beds

So, the final answer is {100}.</s>","If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.
If 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.
After two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.

3. This means that the remaining emails, which are 16 - 7 = 9 emails, are either to her family or her boyfriend.

4. We are told that two-thirds of the remaining 9 emails are to her family. So, the number of emails sent to family is (2/3)*9 = 6 emails.

3. First, let's calculate 20% of the reported number (48): 20% of 48 = (20/100) * 48 = 9.6.
4. Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we round this number to the nearest whole number. In this case, it's still 9.
5. Now, subtract this error from the reported number: 48 - 9 = 39.

Therefore, the final answer is: \boxed{39}.</s>","Since she overstated the number by 20%, 48 is 20% greater than the actual number i.e. 48 = 100% + 20% = 120% of the actual number = 120/100 of the actual number
Therefore, the actual number = (100/120)*48 = <<(100/120)*48=40>>40

                [/INST] The problem states that Jason carried 2 basketballs. According to the information given, Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.

Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as J.

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, we can write Jason's number of balls as 2J.

Jason carried 2 balls, so we have 2J = 2, which means J = 2/2 = 1.

So, Jeffrey carried 1 basketball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, we can write Jordan's number of balls as 2 * Jason's number of balls. But since we know Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Adding up the number of balls each boy carried, we get:

Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls = Total balls
4 + 2 + 1 = Total balls

Therefore, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is {The final answer is \boxed{7}}.</s>","Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 balls.
Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 ball.

                [/INST] Let's break down the information given:

1. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.
2. They dug 13 holes on the second day.
3. They dug 8 holes on the third day, but stopped after making two holes.
4. The total number of holes by the end of the first day was 10.
5. By the third day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.

From the information given, we can infer that the total number of holes dug by the end of the second day was 10 (from the first day) + 13 (from the second day) = 23 holes.

This means that the pirates dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes on the third day before stopping (since they stopped after digging two holes).

The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day was 23 (from the first two days) + 6 (from the beginning of the third day) = 29 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day, the total number of holes by the end of the third day should be 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

This means that the pirates dug 40 - 29 = 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure. {The final answer is 11}.</s>","Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.
The island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.

After filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.
When they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.
Thus, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes on the fourth day.

                [/INST] To find the total cost of travel, we first need to understand that the cost of travel is 50% more than the cost of supplies. This means that the cost of travel is 1.5 times the cost of supplies.

Step 1: Find the cost of supplies
The cost of supplies is given as $400.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of travel
The cost of travel is 1.5 times the cost of supplies. So, we multiply the cost of supplies by 1.5 to find the cost of travel.
Cost of travel = Cost of supplies * 1.5
Cost of travel = $400 * 1.5
Cost of travel = $600

So, the total cost of travel is $600.

                [/INST] Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Stan as S, by Adelwolfe as A, and by Alex as X.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1) S + A + X = 339 (Total number of Pokemon caught)

2) X = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)

3) S = 4A - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)

Now, let's solve these equations step by step:

From equation 2, we can express X in terms of S: X = S + 5

Substitute X in equation 1 with S + 5:

S + A + (S + 5) = 339

2S + A + 5 = 339

2S + A = 334

Now, substitute A in equation 3 with (334 - 2S) / 4:

S = 4((334 - 2S) / 4) - 13

4S = 334 - 2S

6S = 334

S = 334 / 6

S = 55.67 (Since the number of Pokemon must be a whole number, there seems to be a mistake in the given data)

However, if we assume that the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is a whole number, we can adjust the data slightly. For example, if we change the total number of Pokemon caught to 336 instead of 339, then:

S = 336 / 6

S = 56

And the final answer is \boxed{56}. But please note that this answer is based on the assumption of a slight adjustment in the given data.</s>","Let x represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught

2. Next, we need to find out how many episodes there are in total. According to the problem, there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the total number of episodes is half of 20, which is 10.

3. Finally, to find out how long John will spend watching all the episodes, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode. So, the total time spent is 10 (episodes) * 20 (minutes/episode) = 200 minutes.

1. **Brownies Greta Made for Herself:** Greta made 1 batch of brownies, which is not specified in the problem. However, since the other quantities are given in dozens, we can assume she also made a dozen for herself.

2. **Brownies From Office:** Greta received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 1/2 a dozen equals $12 \div 2 = 6$ brownies.

3. **Brownies From Friends:** Greta's friends brought 4 dozen brownies to her party. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 4 dozen equals $4 \times 12 = 48$ brownies.

4. **Total Brownies Before Party:** Adding up the brownies Greta made for herself, the ones from the office, and the ones from her friends, we get a total of $12 + 6 + 48 = 66$ brownies.

5. **Brownies Eaten During the Party:** During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1/2 dozen equals 6, 1 1/2 dozen equals $6 \times 3 = 18$ brownies.

6. **Brownies Left Over:** To find out how many brownies Greta has left over, we subtract the brownies eaten during the party from the total number of brownies she had. This gives us $66 - 18 = 48$ brownies.

Therefore, Greta has $\boxed{48}$ brownies left over from the entire day.</s>","Her office sent her home with a 1/2 dozen brownies so she had 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 individual brownies

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Andy will spend on each type of restringing and then add them up.

1. First, let's calculate the time spent on synthetic gut strings. Andy has 3 racquets to restring with synthetic gut, and it takes him 15 minutes for each. So, the total time spent on synthetic gut strings is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

2. Next, let's calculate the time spent on polyester strings. Andy has 5 racquets to restring with polyester string, and it takes him 22 minutes for each. So, the total time spent on polyester strings is 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

3. Now, let's calculate the time spent on hybrid sets. Andy has 4 racquets to restring with hybrid sets. For each hybrid set, half of the time is taken for synthetic gut strings and half for polyester strings. So, the total time for each hybrid set is 15 + 22 = 37 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on hybrid sets is 4 * 37 = 148 minutes.

4. Finally, let's add up all these times to get the total time Andy spends on all the racquets. Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 148 minutes = 303 minutes.

First phone cost = $600

Next, let's calculate the price for each of the three kids' phones, which are half price after the first:

Kid's phone price = $600 / 2 = $300

Since there are two kids, the cost for their phones would be:

Total kid's phone cost = 2 \* $300 = $600

Now, let's add the cost of John's phone to the total cost of the kids' phones:

Total cost for 4 phones = First phone cost + Total kid's phone cost
Total cost for 4 phones = $600 + $600 = $1200

Total cost for 5 phones = $1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid \boxed{1800} dollars for the phones.</s>","He bought 1+2+1=<<1+2+1=4>>4 phones

                [/INST] Sure, let's break it down:

1. We start with the information that Carlton's team has 13 players.
2. The problem states that Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's. So, Zeke's team has 13 players + 7 players = 20 players.
3. To find out the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players in each team together. That is, 13 players (Carlton's team) + 20 players (Zeke's team) = 33 players.

So, {The final answer is 33 players}.</s>","If Carlton's team has 13 players, Zeke's team has 7 players + 13 players = 20 players.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total length of the fencing that Robert needs to build. Since the fence is rectangular, we need to consider both the length and the width.

Length of the fence = Perimeter of the rectangle = 2*(length + width)

= 2*(15 feet + 10 feet)
= 2*(25 feet)
= 50 feet

Now, since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we can calculate the total number of wood slats required as follows:

Total wood slats = Wood slats per foot * Total length of the fence

= 2 slats * 50 feet
= 100 slats

So, Robert will need {100} wood slats to build his fence.</s>","A rectangle has 2 long sides and Robert wants them to be 15 feet long so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 feet long
A rectangle has 2 short sides and Robert wants them to be 10 feet wide so 2*10= <<2*10=20>>20 feet wide
Together, he will need 30 feet and 20 feet of fencing so 30+20 = <<30+20=50>>50 feet of fencing
He needs 2 wooden slats per 1 foot of fencing and he is building 50 feet of fencing so he needs 50*2 = <<2*50=100>>100 wooden slats

                [/INST] Here's how you can reason through this problem:

1. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
2. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.
3. This means she has 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.
4. She kept 1/4 of the oranges in these 8 boxes, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 boxes.
5. Therefore, she sold the other 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.
6. Each box contains 20 oranges, so she sold 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

So, {The final answer is} Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.</s>","Mrs. Harrington gave a total of 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 boxes of oranges to her mom and sister.
She then had 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 boxes of oranges left.
She kept 8 x 1/4 = <<8*1/4=2>>2 boxes of oranges.
So, she had 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 boxes of oranges to be sold.
Hence, Mrs. Harrington sold 6 boxes x 20 oranges = <<6*20=120>>120 oranges.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to understand that the number of states in India is 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Let's denote the number of states in the USA as x. Then, the number of states in India would be 0.5x + 4.

2. The number of states in India and the USA combined is the sum of the number of states in India and the number of states in the USA. So, the total number of states is x + (0.5x + 4).

3. Simplifying the expression gives us (1.5x + 4). However, we don't know the exact number of states in the USA (x). But we can say that the total number of states is 1.5 times the number of states in the USA, plus 4.

4. Without the exact number of states in the USA, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. But we can express the total number of states as a function of the number of states in the USA.

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 1.5 times the number of states in the USA, plus 4. {The final answer is 1.5x + 4, where x is the number of states in the USA.}</s>","Since the number of states in the USA is 50, half that number is 1/2*50 = 25
Since there are 4 more than half the number of states in the USA in India, there are 25+4 = <<4+25=29>>29 states in India.
Together, the two countries have 50+29 = <<50+29=79>>79 states.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the books**: Tyler wants to buy three items: a dictionary, a dinosaur book, and a children's cookbook. The costs of these items are $18, $13, and $8, respectively. To find the total cost, we add these amounts together:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$18 + \$13 + \$8 = \$39
   \]

2. **Determine the additional amount needed**: Tyler has saved $14 from his allowance. To find out how much more money he needs to afford the books, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost of the books:
   \[
   \text{Additional amount needed} = \$39 - \$14 = \$25
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of hours Tyler needs to work**: Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to afford the additional amount, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly earnings:
   \[
   \text{Hours needed} = \frac{\$25}{\$5 \text{ per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work $\boxed{5}$ hours to afford his books.</s>","Tyler wants to purchase books that cost $18 + $13 + $8 = $<<18+13+8=39>>39.
Tyler needs $39 and currently has $14, so he needs to earn $39 - $14 = $<<39-14=25>>25.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Richard has 10 cherries less than Robert, so Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60, and we have accounted for 30 + 20 = 50 cherries.
4. The remaining cherries belong to Jerry, so Jerry has 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.
5. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has: 30 - 10.

The final answer is \boxed{20} cherries more.

So, Robert has 20 cherries more than Jerry.</s>","Since Robert has 30, then 60 - 30 = <<30=30>>30 cherries are left to be shared by Richard and Jerry.
Richard has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 cherries since Robert has 10 more cherries than him.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. The cost of gingerbread is $6 per box. So, the total earnings from gingerbread on Saturday is 10 boxes * $6/box = $60.

2. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. So, he sold 10 boxes + 5 boxes = 15 boxes of gingerbread. The total earnings from gingerbread on Sunday is 15 boxes * $6/box = $90.

3. The total earnings from gingerbread for the two days is $60 (Saturday) + $90 (Sunday) = $150.

4. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. He sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday. So, he sold 15 boxes - 4 boxes = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

5. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. The cost of apple pie is $15 per box. So, the total earnings from apple pie on Sunday is 15 boxes * $15/box = $225.

6. The total earnings from apple pie for the two days is $11 * $15 (Saturday) + $225 (Sunday) = $165 + $225 = $390.

7. The total earnings for Sunny for the two days is the sum of earnings from gingerbread and apple pie, which is $150 (gingerbread) + $390 (apple pie) = $540.

However, the question seems to be asking for the final answer in a specific format. If we follow the format used in the problem (using a placeholder like ""a"" and ""!""), we can express the total earnings as ""Sunny earned !540 for two days"".

Therefore, the final answer is Sunny earned !540 for two days.</s>","He sold 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total hours Pamela will be outside:**
   Pamela will be outside for 4 hours a day. Over 8 days, the total hours she will be outside is calculated by multiplying the number of days by the hours per day.
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount of sunscreen needed:**
   Since Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour, the total amount of sunscreen needed for the entire vacation can be found by multiplying the total hours by the amount of sunscreen used per hour.
   \[
   \text{Total sunscreen needed} = 32 \times 1 = 32 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sunscreen bottles needed:**
   Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles Pamela needs to pack, divide the total sunscreen needed by the amount in each bottle.
   \[
   \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \text{ bottles}
   \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack $\boxed{4}$ bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.</s>","She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days so that's 4*8 = <<4*8=32>>32 hours

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we first need to find the price of the red car. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we can calculate the price of the red car by taking 40% off the price of the blue car.

Let's denote the price of the red car as R.

We know that the price of the blue car (B) is $100, and the red car (R) is 40% cheaper than the blue car. So, we can write this relationship as:

R = B - 0.4 * B

Substitute B with $100:

R = $100 - 0.4 * $100
R = $60

Now that we know the price of the red car, we can calculate the total cost of both cars:

Total cost = Price of red car + Price of blue car
Total cost = $60 + $100

\boxed{Total cost = $160}</s>","The red car is 40/100 * 100 = $<<40/100*100=40>>40 cheaper than the blue car.
That means, that the red car costs 100 - 40 = $<<100-40=60>>60.
So both cars cost 100 + 60 = $<<100+60=160>>160.

2. At that time, he will be half the age of his dad. So, his dad's age will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

3. At the same time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother. So, his brother's age will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

4. Now, we need to calculate the sum of their current ages. However, we don't have their current ages directly. We only know their ages in 5 years.

5. But we can find their current ages. Emil's dad will be 48 - 5 = 43 years old now, and Emil's brother will be 12 - 5 = 7 years old now.

6. Finally, to find the sum of their ages now, we add Emil's dad's current age (43) and Emil's brother's current age (7). So, the sum is 43 + 7 = 50.

20% of 30 students = (20/100) * 30 = 6 students

Step 2: Calculate the remaining students after excluding football players.
Remaining students = Total students - Football players = 30 - 6 = 24 students

Step 3: Calculate the number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band.
25% of 24 students = (25/100) * 24 = 6 students

Each flowering plant ; costs $6 at the store, !  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower . bed?
                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total width of the flower bed.

Since Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet between every plant and her flowers grow 12 inches wide (which is 1 foot), the total width for each plant and the space between them will be 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.

Now, let's calculate how many plants Pat can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length by the width for each plant and the space between them:

Number of plants = Total length / Width per plant and space
= 111 feet / 2.5 feet
= 44.4 plants

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can only fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Now, let's calculate how many more plants Pat needs to buy:

Additional plants needed = Total plants needed - Owned plants
= 44 plants - 17 plants
= 27 plants

Finally, let's calculate how much money Pat will spend on these additional plants:

Cost = Cost per plant * Number of plants
= $6 * 27
= $162

{The final answer is \boxed{162}}.</s>","Pat's flower bed is 111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = <<111/1.5=74>>74 plants needed.
Pat needs to buy 74 plants - 17 plants = <<74-17=57>>57 plants needed to purchase.
Pat will spend 57 plants * $6 = $<<57*6=342>>342.

1. Determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since he eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, divide the number of pretzels Edgar eats by 2:

Edgar's brother's daily consumption = Pretzels per day / 2
= 18 pretzels / 2
= 9 pretzels

2. Next, calculate how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week by multiplying his daily consumption by 7:

Pretzels in a week = Daily consumption * Weeks

Step 1: Find out how long it takes Emily to peel one shrimp.
Emily can peel 6 shrimp in a minute, so it takes her 1/6 minutes to peel one shrimp.

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to peel all 90 shrimp.
It takes Emily 90 * (1/6) = 15 minutes to peel all 90 shrimp.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. First, let's calculate how much the temperature changed due to the air conditioner.
2. For 3 hours, the air conditioner was on low, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, in 3 hours, it would have cooled the room by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.
3. For the next 4 hours, the air conditioner was on high, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, in 4 hours, it would have cooled the room by 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.
4. The air conditioner was then turned off for 2 hours, but the room would have warmed up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner. So, the temperature would have increased by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.
5. Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature: The room was cooled by 6 + 12 = 18 degrees, but it warmed up by 4 degrees. So, the final temperature is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.</s>","The air conditioner ran for 3 hours on low, so the temperature dropped 2 * 3 = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees.

                [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many years passed between the first and the second sight of the Comet.
Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw the Comet twice (75 years apart), it means that 75 years have passed between the two sightings.

Step 2: Determine Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time.
According to the question, Bill was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time, and 75 years have passed since then, Bill's dad was 30 + 75 = 105 years old when Bill saw the Comet for the second time. At that time, Bill was three times younger, so his age was 105 / 3 = 35 years.

Step 3: Calculate Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time.
Since 75 years have passed between the first and the second sight of the Comet, and Bill was 35 years old during the second sight, he must have been 35 - 75 = -40 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time. However, since age can't be negative, this means that Bill wasn't born yet when his dad saw the Comet for the first time.

Therefore, the question seems to have an error, as it's mathematically impossible for Bill to have seen Comet Halley before his father did.

{The final answer is \boxed{N/A}, due to the error in the question.}</s>","Bill saw the Comet for the second time when he was 30 years * 3= <<30*3=90>>90 years old.

1. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means that the remaining 1/4 of its flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.

2. Since the first plane's flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights it takes to each country is the same.

3. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips in total.

4. Since three-quarters of the first plane's trips are to Greece, that means 1/4 of its trips are to either France or Germany.

5. Therefore, the number of trips to either France or Germany is 88 / 4 = 22.

6. But we know that the first plane takes an equal number of trips to France and Germany. So, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 trips to each country.

\boxed{11}</s>","The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = <<44*2=88>>88 flights a day.
If 3/4 of the first plane’s flights are to Greece, then flights to France or Germany make up 1 – 3/4 = 1/4 of the total daily flights.
Therefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 flights to France or Germany.
Splitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 flights to France in one day.

                [/INST] Let's solve this step by step:

1. The combined length of Tobias' and Chikote's howls can be calculated as follows:
   - Tobias' howls last 20 seconds each.
   - Chikote's howls last twice as long as Tobias' howls, so they last 2 * 20 = 40 seconds each.
   - Since they howl one after the other, the combined length of their howls is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

2. Now, we need to compare this combined length to Tobias' and Chikote's combined length to find the duration of Igneous' howls. Given that Igneous' howls last as long as the other two wolves combined, Igneous' howls also last 60 seconds.

3. Finally, to express the combined length of time in minutes, we convert seconds to minutes:
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Therefore, the combined length of time in minutes is (60 + 60) / 60 = 120 / 60 = \boxed{2} minutes.</s>","Chikote howls for 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seconds.
Igneous howls for 20+40=<<20+40=60>>60 seconds.
In total, the combined length of time, in seconds, of the three wolves' howls is 20+40+60=<<20+40+60=120>>120 seconds.
Thus, the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 minutes.

1. Adam bought trousers costing $30.
2. His mother gave him $6.
3. His father gave him twice as much as his mother did, which means his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, let's calculate how much money Adam received in total from his parents:
$6 (from his mother) + $12 (from his father) = $18

The cost of the trousers is $30, and Adam received $18 from his parents. Therefore, we can calculate how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings:

$30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (money received from parents) = $12

The final answer is:

                [/INST] First, let's find the average age of the group. The total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children in the group.

Average age of the group = Total age / Number of children

Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so her age is:

Helene's age = Average age * 2

= 10 years

Now, let's find the combined age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene:

Combined age = Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age
= 3 + 4 + 10
= 17 years

Since the total age of the children is 20, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the combined age of the other children from the total age:

Wilfred's age = Total age - Combined age

1. We start by calculating the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception. Since each of the 100 guests brought a plate of .15 of cookies, the total number of cookies is 100 guests * .15 cookies/guest = 15 cookies.

2. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1/2 * 15 cookies = 7.5 cookies.

3. Each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. So, the number of people in the church is 7.5 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 0.5 people.

                [/INST] Let's first understand that the total watermelon is to be divided among 6 individuals (2 adults and 4 kids). The problem states that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

Let's denote the slice size for each kid as 'k'. Therefore, the slice size for each adult would be '2k'.

Now, the total number of slices for all the kids would be 4k, and the total number of slices for the adults would be 2*2k = 4k.

So, the total number of slices for all the members of the family is 4k (for kids) + 4k (for adults) = 8k.

We want to find out the percentage of the total watermelon that each adult gets. The adult gets a slice of size 2k.

The percentage can be calculated as: (Size of adult's slice / Total size of watermelon) * 100%

Substituting the values, we get: (2k / 8k) * 100% = 25%

So, each adult gets 25% of the total watermelon.

{The final answer is 25%}</s>","Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.
Since each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon
So the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage
The percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)
x = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

                [/INST] Based on your request, I will break down the problem into smaller steps to understand how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records.

1. First, we need to calculate the total time Doctor Jones needs for rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and spends 20 minutes on each, the total time for rounds will be:
Total time for rounds = Number of inpatients * Time spent on each = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes = 180 minutes

2. Next, we calculate the total time for appointments. Doctor Jones has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes, so:
Total time for appointments = Number of appointments * Time per appointment = 10 appointments * 30 minutes = 300 minutes

3. Now we need to convert these minutes into hours since Doctor Jones has 9 hours available. We do this by dividing the total minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
Time for rounds in hours = 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours
Time for appointments in hours = 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

4. Adding these times together gives us the total time Doctor Jones will spend on rounds and appointments:
Total time spent = Time for rounds + Time for appointments = 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

5. Finally, we subtract this total time spent from Doctor Jones's available time to find out how much time he has left for updating his records:
Time left = Doctor Jones's time - Total time spent = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

{The final answer is: Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.}</s>","Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients, so his rounds will take 9 * 20 = <<9*20=180>>180 minutes.
He has ten appointments, which will take 10 * 30 = <<10*30=300>>300 minutes.
The rounds and appointments will take 180 + 300 = <<180+300=480>>480 minutes total.
An hour is 60 minutes, so rounds and appointments will take 480 / 60 = <<480/60=8>>8 hours.
Doctor Jones will have 9 - 8 = <<9-8=1>>1 hour left to update his records.

The total time needed to make the cake includes the time to make the batter, the time to bake the cake, the time to cool the cake, and the time to frost the cake.

Total time = Time to make batter + Time to bake the cake + Time to cool the cake + Time to frost the cake
= 20 minutes + 30 minutes + 2 hours + 10 minutes

Step 3: Subtract the total time needed to make the cake from the desired serving time.
Desired serving time = 5:00 pm
Total time needed = 3 hours

Step 4: Determine the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake.
The latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

Let x be the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Lisa sold 3.5x chocolate bars.

Peter sold 4.5x chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Now, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:

8x = 64

Next, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 64 / 8

x = 8

So, each box contains 8 chocolate bars.

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total cost of renting the studio for a month.
The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so the studio is rented 3*4 = 12 days in a month. At $25 per session, the total cost of renting the studio for a month is 25*12 = $300.

Step 2: Calculate the total income from student fees for a month.
There are 10 students, and each student pays $1.50 per session. The studio is rented 3 days a week, so each student pays 1.50*3 = $4.50 per week. In a month, each student pays 4.50*4 = $18. With 10 students, the total income from student fees is 10*18 = $180.

Step 3: Calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio for a month.
The expected earnings are the total income from student fees minus the total cost of renting the studio. So, the expected earnings of the dance studio for a month is 180 - 300 = -$120.

1. Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and the total number of chocolate bars he has is 64. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number by the number of boxes:
   64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box (Peter's box).

2. Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and the total number of chocolate bars she has is 56. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number by the number of boxes:
   56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box (Martha's box).

3. To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number of chocolate bars in Peter's box:

The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. So, the total number of female porcupines is (3/5)*50 = 30.

Step 2: Calculate the number of babies each female porcupine gives birth to in a year.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, in a year (which has 12 months), each female porcupine gives birth to 4*12 = 48 babies.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of baby porcupines in the park after a year.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 48 babies in a year. So, the total number of baby porcupines in the park after a year is 48*30 = 1440.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of porcupines in the park after a year.
The total number of porcupines in the park after a year is the total number of female porcupines (which is 30) plus the total number of baby porcupines (which is 1440). So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is 30 + 1440 = 1470.

How much will it cost to fill the pool?
                [/INST] Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular pool is length × width × depth. In this case, that's 25 feet (length) × 14 feet (width) × 4 feet (depth).

Volume = 25 × 14 × 4 = 1400 cubic feet

2. Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons because the cost is given in gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons. So, we multiply the volume in cubic feet by 7.48 to get the volume in gallons.

Volume in gallons = 1400 × 7.48 = 10472 gallons

3. Now, we need to calculate how many gallons of water they need to fill the pool. According to the problem, this is found by multiplying the volume of the pool by 0.59.

Gallons needed = 10472 × 0.59 = 6214.28 gallons

4. Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons needed by the cost per gallon.

Cost = 6214.28 × $0.10 = $621.428

So, the final answer is that it will cost $621.428 to fill the pool.

{The final answer is $621.428}</s>","Mr. Smith found the volume of the pool to be 14 feet wide x 25 feet long x 4 feet deep = <<14*25*4=1400>>1,400 cubic feet
He followed the pool company instructions and found his pool required 1,400 x 5.9 = <<1400*5.9=8260>>8,260 gallons of water.
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 x 8,260 gallons = $<<0.10*8260=826>>826.

                [/INST] **Step 1:** Determine the number of blue sticks.
The problem states there are 9 red sticks and 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is:
\[ 9 + 5 = 14 \] (Since we add 5 to the number of red sticks)

**Step 2:** Calculate the number of yellow sticks.
The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore:
\[ 14 - 3 = 11 \] (Subtracting 3 from the number of blue sticks)

**Step 3:** Concluding the total number of sticks.
Now, to find the total number of sticks, sum the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:
\[ 9 (\text{Red}) + 14 (\text{Blue}) + 11 (\text{Yellow}) \]
\[ 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

Distance_Matteo = 220 miles

For Shandy:
Distance_Shandy = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance_Shandy = 450 miles

Now, subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled to find the difference.

Difference = Distance_Shandy - Distance_Matteo
Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles

1. Initially, we know that the school enrolls 3000 students.

2. Half of these students are over 16 years old, so there are 3000/2 = 1500 students over 16.

3. One-fourth of the students over 16 are male, so there are 1500/4 = 375 male students over 16.

4. Consequently, there are 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16.

5. The remaining half of the students are under 16, which is 3000 - 1500 = 1500 students.

6. Half of the students under 16 are male, so there are 1500/2 = 750 male students under

16. This implies there are 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16.

7. To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over and under 16, which is 1125 + 750 = 1875.

3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey. So, Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps in one hour.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn. So, Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps in one hour.
5. Now, we want to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. So, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5 laps.

                [/INST] {The final answer is:} Maria's power bank was charged to approximately 66% when she went out to the park.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. First, let's consider the rate at which the power bank was losing charge. For the first 5 hours, it was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour. So, the total charge lost during this period was `5 * 9% = 45%`.

2. Then, for the next 3 hours, it was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, the total charge lost during this period was `3 * 7% = 21%`.

3. Therefore, the power bank lost a total of `45% + 21% = 66%` of its total capacity over the entire 8 hours (5 hours at 9% loss + 3 hours at 7% loss).

4. Finally, we know that Maria ended up with 28% charge remaining. Since we've calculated that she lost 66% of the total capacity, we can find the initial charge by adding the charge lost to the remaining charge. That is, `28% + 66% = 94%`.

So, Maria's power bank was charged to approximately 94% (or 66% remaining) when she went out to the park.</s>","At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.
Later on, the power bank lost 7% per hour * 3 hours = 21%.
The power bank charge remaining was 28%, so the power bank charge before going to the park was 45 + 21 +28 = 94%.

1. First, we need to determine how much money Janet makes per week. She earns $10/hour from wages and $15/hour from tips, so that's a total of $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

2. She works 40 hours a week, so she makes 40 hours/week * $25/hour = $1000 per week.

3. The car costs $10000 and she wants to save up 20% for a down payment. So, she needs to save 20% * $10000 = $2000.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

First, let's convert the prices to the same unit. For simplicity, let's express all in the same currency and in cents.

Peaches cost $0.5 each, pears cost $0.5 each, apples cost $0.75 each, kiwis cost $1 each, and plums cost $0.25 each.

Jamaar has $10, which is equivalent to 1000 cents.

He has already purchased 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples. Let's calculate the total cost of these fruits:

Cost of peaches = Price of peach * Number of peaches = $0.5 * 3 = $1.5 = 150 cents
Cost of pears = Price of pear * Number of pears = $0.5 * 4 = $2 = 200 cents
Cost of apples = Price of apple * Number of apples = $0.75 * 5 = $3.75 = 375 cents
Cost of kiwis = Price of kiwi * Number of kiwis = $1 * 2 = $2 = 200 cents

Total cost of these fruits = 150 + 200 + 375 + 200 = 925 cents

Remaining money = Total money - Total cost = 1000 - 925 = 775 cents

Now, let's calculate how many plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining money:

Number of plums = Remaining money / Price of plum = 775 / 0.25 = 3100

However, this is not a realistic answer as Jamaar cannot buy 3100 plums with only $10. The mistake is that we divided the cents instead of the dollars. Let's correct this:

Number of plums = Remaining money / Price of plum = 7.75 / 0.25 = 31

So, Jamaar can buy 31 plums with the remaining money.

{The final answer is: 31 plums}</s>","He has spent $3.5 on peaches and pears because 7 x .5 = <<7*.5=3.5>>3.5
He has spent $2 on kiwis because 2 x 1 = <<2*1=2>>2

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of sweets Anne purchased.
The total number of sweets is the number of packs times the number of sweets in each pack. 
Total sweets = packs * sweets per pack
Total sweets = 15 * 60
Total sweets = 900

Step 2: Calculate the number of sweets Anne kept.
Anne kept 2 packs, so the number of sweets she kept is:
Sweets Anne kept = packs * sweets per pack
Sweets Anne kept = 2 * 60
Sweets Anne kept = 120

Step 3: Calculate the number of sweets Anne gave to her friends.
Subtract the number of sweets Anne kept from the total number of sweets to find out how many she gave to her friends:
Sweets given to friends = Total sweets - Sweets Anne kept
Sweets given to friends = 900 - 120
Sweets given to friends = 780

Step 4: Calculate the number of sweets each of Anne's friends received.
Anne had 10 friends, so the number of sweets each friend received is:
Sweets per friend = Sweets given to friends / number of friends
Sweets per friend = 780 / 10
Sweets per friend = 78

The final answer is that each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

\boxed{78}</s>","After Anne kept 2 packs, there were only 15 - 2 = <<15-2=13>>13 packs left.

(Round to the nearest integer)
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we will calculate the price of the carrots after each year and then apply the 5% increase to find the price for the next year. We will proceed for three years:

1. After the first year, the carrots' price increases by 5% of the original price ($120). To find the increased price, follow these steps:
a. Calculate 5% of $120 by multiplying the amount by the percentage (expressed as a decimal): $120 * 0.05 = $6.
b. Add the calculated increase to the original price: $120 + $6 = $126.
So, the price after the first year is $126.

2. After the second year, the carrots' price increases again by 5%. This time, the 5% increase is applied to the new price ($126):
a. Calculate 5% of $126 by multiplying the amount by the percentage (expressed as a decimal): $126 * 0.05 = $6.30.
b. Add the calculated increase to the current price: $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.
So, the price after the second year is $132.30.

3. After the third year, we apply the 5% increase to the price from the second year ($132.30):
a. Calculate 5% of $132.30 by multiplying the amount by the percentage (expressed as a decimal): $132.30 * 0.05 = $6.615.
b. Add the calculated increase to the current price: $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.
Since the price rounded to the nearest integer for each year, we will round this value to the nearest integer: $138.915 ≈ $139.

                [/INST] First, we need to find out how many portraits and selfies are in each album. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into each album, we can divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find out how many pictures are in each album.

Total number of pictures = 72
Number of albums = 8

Pictures in each album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums
Pictures in each album = 72 / 8
Pictures in each album = 9

Next, we need to find out how many portraits and selfies are in the portraits albums and selfies albums. Since there are 2 portrait albums and each album has 9 pictures, there are 2 * 9 = 18 portraits.

Similarly, since there are 3 selfie albums and each album has 9 pictures, there are 3 * 9 = 27 selfies.

Finally, we can add the number of portraits and selfies together to find out how many portraits and selfies Olivia had in total.

Portraits = 18
Selfies = 27

Total portraits and selfies = Portraits + Selfies
Total portraits and selfies = 18 + 27
Total portraits and selfies = 45

                [/INST] To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine the rate at which he reads and then apply that rate to the number of pages he actually reads before going to sleep.

1. First, let's find out how many minutes it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing the total time by the number of pages:

Time per page = Total time / Number of pages
= 10 minutes / 3 pages
= 3.33 minutes/page

2. Now that we know it takes James approximately 3.33 minutes to read one page, we can calculate how long he spends reading 18 pages:

Total reading time = Time per page * Number of pages
= 3.33 minutes/page * 18 pages
= 59.94 minutes

So, James spends approximately 60 minutes (59.94 minutes rounded up to the nearest whole minute) reading his book before he goes to bed.

In ! the afternoon ; twice as many people checked in as those who opted for ; a late checkout.  7 more people checked in after dinner was served.  How many guests does the hotel now have?
                [/INST] Firstly, we need to determine how many guests have checked in in the afternoon, which is twice the number of guests who elected for a late checkout. So, 15 guests who elected for a late checkout means 15 * 2 = 30 guests checked in in the afternoon.

Now, if 24 guests elected an early checkout, then these guests are no longer present in the hotel. Similarly, the 15 guests who elected for a late checkout will only join the remaining 100 guests after their check-in times. Hence, these 15 guests are also not present at this point.

The net addition to the hotel guests in the afternoon is thus 30 (from the weekend guests), and 7 more people checked in after dinner was served.

Therefore, the total number of guests now in the hotel = 100 (initial number) - 24 (early checkouts) + 30 (weekend check-ins) + 7 (people who checked in after dinner).

Final number of guests: 100 - 24 + 30 + 7 = 103.

Final answer: {The final answer is 103}.

Please remember that this calculation assumed that guests who elected for an early checkout left the hotel immediately and did not wait for their designated time.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem into steps to find out how many points Aries is sure to get:

1. First, we need to determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions.
   - Easy questions: 40% of 60 items = 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions
   - Average and difficult questions: Since they are equally divided, they make up the remaining 60% of the quiz. That's 0.6 * 60 = 36 questions, split equally between average and difficult.

2. Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct.
   - Correct easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions

3. Aries gets half of the average and difficult questions correct.
   - Half of the average questions: 18 questions (since they are half of the 36 average and difficult questions)
   - Half of the difficult questions: Also 18 questions

4. Now we add up the questions Aries is sure to get correctly:
   - Easy questions: 18
   - Average questions: 18
   - Difficult questions: 18
   - Total correct questions: 18 + 18 + 18 = 54 questions

Since each question is worth 1 point, the total number of points Aries is sure to get is equal to the number of questions she is sure to answer correctly.

{The final answer is} 54 points.</s>","The average and difficult questions comprises 100% - 40% = 60% of the quiz.

There are a total of 60 questions x 60/100 = <<60*60/100=36>>36 average and difficult questions.
If Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, then this means she is sure of her 24 questions x 75/100 = <<24*75/100=18>>18 points.
From the average and difficult questions, she is sure to get half of it correctly so that is 36 questions / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 points.

                [/INST] Let's reason through this step by step:

Step 1: Define the variables. Let's call the number of large stuffed animals that Teresa sold L and the number of small stuffed animals that she sold S.

Step 2: Establish the given information. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write the equation S = 2L.

Step 3: We also know that Teresa earned $120 from her sales. Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, we can say that the total revenue from the small stuffed animals is 4S.

Step 4: Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the revenue from each large stuffed animal is 3*4 = $12.

Step 5: Therefore, the total revenue from both small and large stuffed animals is 4S + 12L = $120.

Step 6: Now, substitute the equation S = 2L into the revenue equation to get 4(2L) + 12L = 120.

Step 7: Simplify the equation to get 8L + 12L = 120, which further simplifies to 20L = 120.

Step 8: Solve for L: L = 120 / 20 = 6.

Step 9: Substitute L = 6 into the equation S = 2L, which gives us S = 2*6 = 12.

The final answer is that Teresa sold \boxed{12} small stuffed animals.</s>","Let A be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.

1. First, we need to find out how much ore a dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe. So, with an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

2. Next, we need to find out how much more ore a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe compared to an iron pickaxe. Since a steel pickaxe allows a dwarf to mine 50% more than an iron pickaxe, we can calculate this by taking 50% of 24 (the amount mined with an iron pickaxe), which is 24 * 0.5 = 12 pounds more. So, with a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

3. Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in a day. Multiply the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe by the number of dwarves: 36 pounds * 40 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

4. To find out how much ore these 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, multiply the daily amount by the number of days in the month: 1440 pounds/day * 30 = 43,200 pounds of ore.

Let's denote the cost of the third package as X.

Step 1: Understand the proportionality between the sizes and their costs.
- The first package has 2 sandwiches and costs $3.
- The second package has 4 sandwiches and costs $6.

This means that the cost increases by $3 when going from 2 sandwiches to 4 sandwiches, which indicates that each sandwich adds $1.5 to the cost.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the third package.
- The third package has 8 sandwiches.
- Each sandwich adds $1.5 to the cost.

Suddenly, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst.  The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  But as she neared the school grounds, she ! found , 8 blue balloons caught in a tree, and she added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, which she carried ; into the school. ?  ? What number of . balloons did : she finally carry into the school?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sally starts with 25 red balloons.

2. A gust of wind causes 40% of the red balloons to burst. We calculate 40% of 25:
   25 * 40/100 = 10
   So, 10 red balloons burst.

3. Now, Sally has 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

4. She also has 7 green balloons and 12 yellow balloons.

5. Sally accidentally releases half of the yellow balloons. We calculate half of 12:
   12 / 2 = 6
   So, she loses 6 yellow balloons.

6. Now, Sally has 6 yellow balloons left.

7. She finds 8 blue balloons, but only adds 75% of them to her clutch. We calculate 75% of 8:
   8 * 75/100 = 6
   So, she adds 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

8. Now, let's add up all the balloons Sally has:
   15 red balloons + 7 green balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 34

Therefore, \boxed{34} is the final answer.</s>","Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons

                    question:
                    Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.

Even if the whole class doesn't get an . extension, there's a 20% . chance Marcus can . convince the teacher , his dog ate his assignment and : get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to consider all the possible scenarios where Marcus will not have to turn in his homework and then calculate the probability of these scenarios occurring. Finally, we will subtract this probability from 100% to find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework.

1. Scenario 1: The substitute teacher is present. This has a 50% chance of happening. If the substitute teacher is present, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework because the substitute teacher will not collect the homework.

2. Scenario 2: The normal teacher is present, but she gives everyone an extension. This has a 40% chance that the normal teacher will be present, and a 40% chance that she will give everyone an extension. The probability of both these events happening is their product, which is 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16 (or 16%).

3. Scenario 3: The normal teacher is present, does not give everyone an extension, but Marcus still manages to convince the teacher that his dog ate his assignment. If the normal teacher is present and does not give everyone an extension, the probability of this is 0.6 * 0.6 (0.4 probability that she does not give an extension and 0.6 probability that Marcus tries to convince her), which is 0.36 (or 36%). However, Marcus can only convince the teacher in 20% of these cases. So, the probability of Marcus convincing the teacher is 0.36 * 0.2 = 0.072 (or 7.2%).

The probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework is the sum of these probabilities: 0.5 (Scenario 1) + 0.16 (Scenario 2) + 0.072 (Scenario 3) = 0.732.

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 1 - 0.732 = 0.268 (or 26.8%).

Final answer: {26.8%}</s>","First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%
Then find the chance the teacher doesn't grant the whole class an extension by subtracting the chance she does from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%
Then find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%
Now find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3
Now multiply that probability by the probability Marcus can't get a personal extension to find the probability he actually has to turn in his homework: .3 * .8 = <<.3*.8=.24>>.24

                [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of seats available for the graduation.
The Fine Arts Center can hold 6000 people, but since it's a graduation, we need to account for seats taken by graduates and faculty.

Step 2: Subtract the number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total number of seats.
There are 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty. So, the remaining seats would be 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats.

Step 3: Divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.
Since the problem doesn't specify the number of graduates, we can only say that each graduate would receive a certain number of tickets if the tickets are split equally. Without this information, we can't provide a specific number for the tickets each graduate would receive.

Final answer: It's not possible to provide a specific number of tickets each graduate would receive without knowing the total number of graduates. {The final answer is: Cannot be determined with the given information.}</s>","Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates

1. We know that Grandpa loves to eat jelly beans, and he needs 75 large jelly beans to fill him up.

2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large ones. So, if we let M represent the number of medium-sized beans, we have M = 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, if we let S represent the number of small beans, we have S = 3 * M / 1 = 3 * 150 = 450 small beans.

So, \boxed{450} small beans can Grandpa eat.</s>","If Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, then eating 75 large beans is the same as eating 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 medium-sized jelly beans.

Step 2: Calculate Melissa's total earnings before expenses.
Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are:
$15 × 3 days = $45

Step 3: Calculate Melissa's total parking costs.
Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so her total parking costs are:
$3 × 3 days = $9

Step 4: Calculate Melissa's total jury pay after expenses.
Melissa's total earnings minus her total parking costs is:
$45 - $9 = $36

Step 5: Calculate Melissa's jury pay per hour after expenses.
Melissa's total jury pay after expenses divided by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty is:

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of soda bottles Richard will place along the driveway and then determine the total time it will take him to set off all the soda fountains.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of soda bottles.
Richard wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet of the 24 feet wide driveway. To find out how many bottles he will place, we divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

So, Richard will place 8 bottles of soda along the driveway.

Step 2: Calculate the total time to set off all the soda fountains.
After starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in the process. Since there are 8 bottles, we multiply the time it takes to move between each bottle by the total number of bottles minus one (since the first bottle doesn't require a move to reach it):

(8 bottles - 1) * 5 seconds/bottle = 7 bottles * 5 seconds/bottle = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard a total of 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is {35}.</s>","If Richard's driveway is 24 feet long and he puts a bottle of soda every 3 feet, then out of 24 feet total there are 24 / 3 feet between each bottle = <<24/3=8>>8 bottles.

   = 80 apples

2. Next, we need to figure out how many packs Uncle Franky can make with eight apples in one pack. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in one pack:
   Number of packs = Total apples / Apples per pack
   = 80 / 8
   = 10 packs

So, Uncle Franky can make {10} packs of apples with eight apples in one pack using the two boxes of apples.</s>","There are 2 x 40 = <<2*40=80>>80 apples in two boxes.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate how much money Jim lost while he was in school. This is simply the amount of money he would have earned if he had continued his old job for the same period of time.

Money lost from not working = Annual salary before college * Number of years in school
Money lost from not working = $25,000/year * 4 years
Money lost from not working = $100,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim took out.

Total loans = Loans per year * Number of years in school
Total loans = $50,000/year * 4 years
Total loans = $200,000

Jim received a tripling of his income after college, so his new salary would be:

New annual salary = Annual salary before college * 3
New annual salary = $25,000/year * 3
New annual salary = $75,000/year

Now, we need to calculate how long it would take Jim to earn the equivalent of the loans and the money lost from not working. This would be the sum of the total loans and the money lost, divided by Jim's new annual salary.

Total equivalent = Total loans + Money lost from not working
Total equivalent = $200,000 + $100,000
Total equivalent = $300,000

Time to earn equivalent = Total equivalent / New annual salary
Time to earn equivalent = $300,000 / $75,000/year
Time to earn equivalent = 4 years

So, {the final answer is} it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to his loans and the money he lost from not working while in school.</s>","His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year

1. First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric Jim needs. The problem states that he needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the king-sized bed.

2. The king-sized bed measures 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. So, to find the dimensions of one piece of fabric, we add 2 feet to each dimension:
   - Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
   - Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

3. Now, we have the dimensions of one piece of fabric (8 feet by 10 feet), but we need two identical pieces. So, we need to calculate the area of one piece and then double it.

4. The area of one piece of fabric can be calculated by multiplying its length and width:
   - Area of one piece: 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

5. Since Jim needs two identical pieces of fabric, we double the area of one piece to find the total area he needs:
   - Total area: 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy {160 square feet} of fabric.</s>","First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet

Then find the square footage of each piece of fabric by multiplying its length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet
Then double that amount since Jim needs two pieces of fabric: 80 square feet/piece * 2 pieces = <<80*2=160>>160 square feet

                    Molly is catering a birthday party for her ! sister and invited ! 16 people. 10 people want . the chicken salad which is $6.50 per person and 6 people want the pasta salad at $6 per person. What ! is the total amount Molly will pay for the catering?
                [/INST] First, we need to calculate the total cost for the chicken salad. There are 10 people who want the chicken salad, and it costs $6.50 per person. So we multiply the number of people by the cost per person to get the total cost for the chicken salad:
\begin{align\*}
10 \cdot \$6.50 = \boxed{\$65}
\end{align\*}

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for the pasta salad. There are 6 people who want the pasta salad, and it costs $6 per person. So we multiply the number of people by the cost per person to get the total cost for the pasta salad:
\begin{align\*}
6 \cdot \$6 = \boxed{\$36}
\end{align\*}

Finally, we need to add the total cost for the chicken salad and the total cost for the pasta salad to get the total amount Molly will pay for the catering:
\begin{align\*}
\$65 + \$36 = \boxed{\$101}
\end{align\*}

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{101}$.</s>","Multiply the number of people who want chicken salad by the cost per person, so the cost is 10 x $6.50 = $<<10*6.5=65>>65.
Multiply the amount of people who want pasta salad by the cost per person, so the cost is 6 x $6.00 = $<<6*6=36>>36.
The total cost of chicken salad and pasta salad is $65 + $36 = $<<65+36=101>>101.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Race Loss**: Johnny's dad lost $5 in the first race.

2. **Second Race Win**: He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, if he lost $5 in the first race, twice this amount is $10, and $1 more than this is $11. So, he won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race Loss**: He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, 1.5 times this amount is $16.5. So, he lost $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost and won:

- Total lost: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total won: $11 (second race)

The net loss is then $21.5 (total lost) - $11 (total won) = $10.5.

To find the average loss per race, we divide the net loss by the number of races (which is 3):

Average loss = ($10.5 / 3) = $3.5

So, Johnny's dad lost an average of $3.5 per race that day.

{The final answer is: $3.5 per race on average.}</s>","On the second race he won $11 because 1+ 5 x 2 = <<1+5*2=11>>11
On the third race he lost $15 because 10 x 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15
He lost a total of $20 on the first and third races because 15 + 5 = <<15+5=20>>20

He lost $9 that day because 11 - 20 = <<11-20=-9>>-9
He lost an average of $3 per race because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3

1. We start with the number of cities in each country. According to the question, there are 5 cities in each country.
2. Next, we know that each city has 1000 people. So, the population in one country would be the number of cities times the population in each city. That's 5 cities * 1000 people = 5000 people.
3. Now, we have 26 countries in South America. So, the total population of South America would be the number of countries times the population in each country. That's 26 countries * 5000 people = 130,000 people.

So, the final answer is {There are 130,000 people in South America}.</s>","Since each country has 5 cities, then in all the 26 countries, there are 26*5 = <<26*5=130>>130 cities.

                [/INST] To find the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now, we first need to convert both their heights to the same units. Since Xavier's height is given in feet and Cole's height is given in inches, we'll convert Xavier's height to inches.

1. Convert Xavier's height to inches:
   Xavier's original height = 4 feet
   Since 1 foot = 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches = 4 * 12 = 48 inches

2. Calculate Cole's new height:
   Cole's original height = 50 inches
   Cole grew by 2 inches over the summer, so his new height = 50 + 2 = 52 inches

3. Calculate Xavier's new height:
   Xavier's original height in inches = 48 inches
   Xavier grew by 3 inches over the summer, so his new height = 48 + 3 = 51 inches

4. Calculate the difference between Cole and Xavier’s new heights:

                [/INST] Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

2. According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first, so the amount the second person took is x + $80.

3. The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount the third person took is 2 * (x + $80).

4. The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + $80) + 2 * (x + $80) = $1920.

5. Simplifying the equation gives: 4x + $160 = $1920.

6. Subtracting $160 from both sides gives: 4x = $1760.

7. Dividing both sides by 4 gives: x = $440.

8. So, the first person took $440.

Therefore, the share of the first one is \boxed{$440}.</s>","Let X be the amount of what the first took.
The second took X+<<+80=80>>80.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, let's find out how many days the painters worked. We know that they worked for 3 weeks, and there are 7 days in a week. So, the total number of days worked is 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

2. Next, we need to find out how many ""days"" they worked each day, since they worked for 3/8ths of a day. So, the number of ""days"" they worked each day is 3/8ths of 1 day = 3/8 days.

3. Now, let's find out how many ""days"" they worked in total. This is the product of the number of days they worked each day and the total number of days they worked. So, the total number of ""days"" they worked is 21 days * 3/8 days/day = 63/8 days.

4. Finally, to find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to know how many hours are in a day. Assuming a day has 24 hours, then each painter worked 63/8 days * 24 hours/day = 189 hours.

5. Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked. So, each painter worked 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours.

So, {The final answer is} 47.25 hours of work for each painter.</s>","There are 24 hours in a day so 3/8ths of a day is (3/8)*24 = <<3/8*24=9>>9 hours

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step. We use a lot of reasoning to get the answer.

1. Let's denote the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set as ""x"".
2. In the first set, Rory retrieved ""x+4"" balls.
3. In the third set, Rory retrieved half of what he retrieved in the second set, so ""x/2"" balls.
4. The total number of balls Rory retrieved is ""x + x/2 + x + 4"" (from the first, second, and third sets respectively, plus the extra 4 from the first set).
5. We know that the total number of balls Rory retrieved is 19, so we set up the equation ""x + x/2 + x + 4 = 19"".
6. Combining the x terms gives us ""3.5x + 4 = 19"".
7. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us ""3.5x = 15"".
8. Dividing by 3.5 gives us ""x = 4.28."" Since we can't have 0.28 of a tennis ball, this suggests there was a mis-match in the formulation or a mistake. So, we have to reassess.
9. Looking back, we see that we added the x in the second set twice. The correct calculation would be ""2x + x/2 + x + 4"" or ""3.5x + 4 = 19"".
10. Recalculating ""x"" using the amended equation ""3x/2 + 4 = 19"" gives us ""x = 4.
11. Finally, the number of balls Rory retrieved in the first set is ""x + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8"".

Therefore, {The final answer is Rory retrieved 8 tennis balls in the first set of the match}.</s>","Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.
In the second set, he retrieved 2B balls.

Thus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.
Therefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.
Hence, in the second set, he retrieved 2B = 3 * 2 = 6 balls.

We are given that Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007, and it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. We need to find the price of the car in 2010.

Step 2: Calculate the annual depreciation price
First, we need to find the annual depreciation price. It's better to express this as a decimal, which would be 0.21.

Step 3: Calculate the price of the car after one year (2008)
To find the price of the car in 2008, subtract the annual depreciation from the original price:
\begin{align*}
\text{Price in 2008} &= \text{Original price} - \text{Annual depreciation} \times \text{Original price} \\
&= 20000 - 0.21 \times 20000 \\
&= 20000 - 4200 \\
&= 15800

Step 4: Calculate the price of the car after subsequent years
To find the price of the car in 2009 and 2010, repeat

Step 3 for each year:
\begin{align*}
\text{Price in 2009} &= 15800 - 0.21 \times 15800 \\
&= 15800 - 3318 \\
&= 12482
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\text{Price in 2010} &= 12482 - 0.21 \times 12482 \\
&= 12482 - 2624.22 \\
&= 9857.78
\end{align*}

Step 5: Find the final answer
The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9857.78.

Final answer: {The final answer is \boxed{9857.78}}</s>","The price of the car depreciates of 20000 * 21% = $<<20000*21*.01=4200>>4200 per year.

The price of the car depreciates 4200 * 3 = $<<4200*3=12600>>12600 from 2007 to 2010.
So the price of the car in the year 2010 is $20000 - $12600 = $<<20000-12600=7400>>7400.

Step 3: Additionally, 10% of the 50 books are written in German, which means there are 5 German books (since 10% of 50 is 5).

Step 4: Now, we need to find out how many Spanish books there are. The English and German books together make up 25 + 5 = 30 books.

Step 5: Since there are 50 books total, this means that the remaining books must be written in Spanish.

Step 6: Therefore, there are 50 - 30 = 20 Spanish books.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the cost of the running shorts. The tank top cost $10, and the shorts cost $5 more than the top. So, the shorts cost $10 + $5 = $15.

2. Next, let's calculate the cost of the tennis shoes. The shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. So, the shoes cost $48 / 2 = $24.

3. Now, let's calculate the cost of the athletic socks. The socks cost $8, but Alison had a coupon for $2 off. So, the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

4. Finally, let's add up the cost of all the items to find out how much Alison spent in total. So, she spent $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55 on athletic gear.

The final answer is: Alison spent $55 on athletic gear.</s>","The shorts were $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $5 + $10 = $<<5+10=15>>15.
Her tennis shoes were half the original $68 price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
With her coupon, the socks were $8 - $2 = $<<8-2=6>>6.
The shirt, shorts, shoes, and socks together cost $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $<<10+15+24+6=55>>55.

1. Calculate the number of tiles needed: Since each tile has an area of 1 square foot, and the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet, you will need 200 tiles to cover the entire floor.

2. Calculate the total cost: The cost of each tile is $12, and you need 200 tiles. So, the total cost would be 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is {The total cost will be $2400}.</s>","The total area of a square tile is length * width or 1*1 = <<1*1=1>>1 SqFt
If the kitchen has a total area of 200 SqFt then my kitchen needs 200/1 = <<200/1=200>>200 square tiles

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. The normal cost of the insurance is $120 a month.
2. However, due to the accident, the cost is 60% more than normal. To find out how much more this is, we calculate 60% of $120. This is done by multiplying $120 by 60/100 (since 60% is 60 out of 100). So, the extra cost is $120 * 60/100 = $72.
3. Therefore, the new cost of the insurance after the accident is the original cost plus the extra cost, which is $120 + $72 = $192 a month.
4. Finally, to find out how much James pays a year, we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year, which is 12. So, the annual cost is $192 * 12 = $2304.

So, {The final answer is $2304}.</s>","The insurance is 120*.6=$<<120*.6=72>>72 per month more expensive than normal

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps and calculate the number of loads Greg does per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.

1. First, let's calculate the number of loads Greg does per week for the twin sheets. He puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds, and his laundry machine allows him to wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time. So, he does 4 / 2 = 2 loads of twin sheets per week.

2. Next, let's calculate the number of loads Greg does per week for the king size sheets. He puts clean sheets on 1 king size bed, and his laundry machine allows him to wash 1 king size set of sheets at a time. So, he does 1 / 1 = 1 load of king size sheets per week.

3. Now, let's add these together to find the total number of loads per week. Greg does 2 loads of twin sheets + 1 load of king size sheets = 3 loads of laundry per week.

4. Finally, let's calculate the number of loads Greg does in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does 3 loads per week * 52 weeks = 156 loads of laundry in a year.

So, \boxed{156} is the final answer.</s>","He has to wash 4 twin size sheet sets each week and the machine will only let him do 2 sets at a time so he has to do 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 loads of twin size sheets

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much cat food Imma uses in a day to feed her 3 cats. Since she feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams each time, we calculate the daily consumption as follows:

Daily consumption = Amount of food per meal * Number of meals
   = 60 grams * 2
   = 120 grams

2. Next, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

Number of days = Total cat food / Daily consumption
   = 720 grams / 120 grams
   = 6 days

Therefore, the final answer is {The 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days}.</s>","The 3 cats consume 60 grams/cat x 3 cats = <<60*3=180>>180 grams of food per meal.
Since they eat twice a day, then they consume 180 grams/meal x 2 meals/day = <<180*2=360>>360 grams in a day.
So, 720 grams of cat food only last for 720 grams / 360 grams/day = <<720/360=2>>2 days.

Now, we know that Becky ate 10 slices. According to the problem, Jake ate 3 less slices than Becky, so Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so she ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add up the slices that each person ate: 10 (Becky's slices) + 7 (Jake's slices) + 14 (Silvia's slices).

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. We know that the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes.
2. We also know that Betsy's part of the meal took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. Let's denote the time taken by Donovan as 'D' and the time taken by Betsy as 'B'.
3. So, we can say that B = D + 18.
4. The total time is the sum of Betsy's and Donovan's times, so we can write this as D + B = 98.
5. We can substitute B from the first equation into the second equation: D + (D + 18) = 98.
6. Solving this gives us 2D + 18 = 98, and then 2D = 80, and finally D = 40.
7. Now that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's part using the first equation: B = 40 + 18.

First, let's calculate the cost of the doctor's visit. The doctor charges $300 per hour. Since it's a 30-minute visit, we need to divide this by 2 to get the cost:

Cost of visit = $300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150

Next, let's calculate the cost of the painkillers. The doctor charges $4 per pill. For 30 pills, the cost would be:

Cost of painkillers = $4/pill * 30 pills = $120

Finally, let's calculate the cost of parking. The doctor charges $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost would be:

Cost of parking = $6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Now, let's add up all these costs to find the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of visit + Cost of painkillers + Cost of parking
= $150 + $120 + $12 = $382

1. **Calculate the number of emails James gets each day**: James receives 80 emails per day.

2. **Determine the percentage of emails that require a response**: If 20% of the emails don't require a response, then 80% of the emails do require a response. To find out how many emails that is per day, we calculate:

   80\% \times 80 = 0.8 \times 80 = 64 \text{ emails}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of emails James responds to in a week**: Since he responds to 64 emails each day, over a 5-day work week, the total number of emails he responds to is:
   \[
   64 \text{ emails/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 320 \text{ emails}

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the total score John got from the first 3 tests. Since each test is out of 100, and we don't know the individual scores, but we know the average, we can assume that the average of these 3 tests is 100. So, the total score from the first 3 tests would be 3 * 100 = 300.

2. Next, we add the score from the 4th test, which is 80, to the total score from the first 3 tests. So, 300 + 80 = 380.

                [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. That means they ate 20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas.
2. This leaves 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left from the glee club's order.
3. The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 20 * 2 = 40 pizzas.
4. The football team ate 80% of their pizzas, which is 40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas.
5. This leaves 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left from the football team's order.

Now, to find out how many pizzas are left in total, we add the remaining pizzas from the glee club and the football team: 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas.

So, {The final answer is} 14 pizzas are left.</s>","First find the percentage of pizzas left from the glee club: 100% - 70% = 30%
Then multiply that percentage by the number of pizzas the glee club ordered to find the number of pizzas left: 30% * 20 pizzas = <<30*.01*20=6>>6 pizzas
Then multiply the number of pizzas the glee club ordered by 2 to find the number the football team ordered: 20 pizzas * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 pizzas
Then find the percentage of pizzas left from the football team: 100% - 80% = 20%
Then multiply that percentage by the number of pizzas the football team ordered to find the number of pizzas left: 20% * 40 pizzas = <<20*.01*40=8>>8 pizzas
Then add the number of pizzas left from each group to find the total number left: 8 pizzas + 6 pizzas = <<8+6=14>>14 pizzas

                [/INST] First, we need to find out how many big coupons Anthony wants to send out. He wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he has 700 small coupons. So, he wants to send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of sending out the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents, and he's sending out 700 of them. So, the total cost for the small coupons is 700 * 5 = 3500 cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the total cost for the small coupons in dollars is 3500 / 100 = 35 dollars.

Then, we need to calculate the cost of sending out the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, and he's sending out 1400 of them. So, the total cost for the big coupons is 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the total cost for the big coupons in dollars is 21000 / 100 = 210 dollars.

Finally, we need to add the cost of sending out the small coupons and the big coupons to find the total cost of postage. The total cost of postage is 35 dollars + 210 dollars = 245 dollars.

So, the final answer is \boxed{245}.</s>","First find the total cost of the small coupons: 700 coupons * $0.05/coupon = $<<700*0.05=35>>35

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total amount of fertiliser that was originally planned to be delivered by all the trucks:

Total fertiliser = Number of trucks * Fertiliser per truck
= 20 trucks * 20 tons/truck
= 400 tons

Next, let's calculate the number of trucks that had mechanical failures:

Failed trucks = Total trucks * Fraction of failed trucks
= 20 trucks * 1/4
= 5 trucks

This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

Successful trucks = Total trucks - Failed trucks
= 20 trucks - 5 trucks
= 15 trucks

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers:

Total fertiliser delivered = Successful trucks * Fertiliser per truck
= 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck

If the ! butter costs $4.00 a pound, how much will it cost him to purchase , 6 pounds ? of butter?
                [/INST] Step 1: Determine the amount of butter Dennis needs.
Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants and uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. So, he needs 6 * 1 = 6 pounds of butter.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of butter without any promotion.
The cost of 1 pound of butter is $4.00. So, the cost of 6 pounds of butter would be 6 * $4.00 = $24.00.

Step 3: Apply the promotion.
Under the promotion, for every pound of butter bought, Dennis gets half off on the next pound. So, for every two pounds of butter, Dennis pays $4.00. Therefore, Dennis pays for 6/2 = 3 sets of two pounds of butter.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of butter with the promotion.

Kayla invited her 25 classmates, 7 other girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. So, the total number of guests invited is:
25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class girls) + 13 (family members) = 45 guests

Step 2: Subtract the number of guests who could not come.
Only 4 people said they could not come, so the total number of guests who will attend is:
45 (total guests) - 4 (could not come) = 41 guests

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since 20 guests are covered by the initial $125, we only need to calculate the cost for the 21 additional guests:
21 (additional guests) * $6 (cost per additional guest) = $126

Step 1: Calculate the daily banana consumption of the first monkey.
The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

Step 2: Calculate the daily banana consumption of the second monkey.
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey. So, the second monkey eats 10 (bananas eaten by the first monkey) + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Step 3: Calculate the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys each day.
Total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys each day = 10 (bananas eaten by the first monkey) + 14 (bananas eaten by the second monkey) = 24 bananas.

Step 4: Calculate the total bananas available each day.
Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. There are 7 days in a week. So, the total bananas available each day = 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas.

Step 5: Calculate the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day.
The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day. So, the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day = Total bananas available each day - Total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys each day = 45 bananas - 24 bananas = 21 bananas.

{The final answer is} The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.</s>","Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. This means the first train leaves at 30 minutes (10 minutes arrival + 20 minutes stay).

2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (half an hour). So, it arrives at 60 minutes (30 minutes + 30 minutes). The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 5 minutes (1/4 of 20 minutes). Therefore, the second train leaves at 65 minutes (60 minutes arrival + 5 minutes stay).

3. The third train arrives 65 minutes after the second train leaves, but it leaves immediately when it arrives. This means the third train arrives and leaves at the same time, 65 minutes after the second train.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (which is the same time the third train arrived and left), so the fourth train arrives at 85 minutes (65 minutes + 20 minutes).

Therefore, Paul will wait for his train for 85 minutes.

{The final answer is: 85 minutes}</s>","The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.
So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:
10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks

Step 2: Calculate the remaining number of toothpicks Melanie needs to collect.
The blueprint requires 200 toothpicks, and Melanie has already collected 120 toothpicks. So, the remaining number of toothpicks she needs is:
200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks

Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks.
Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. So, the number of weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks is:
80 / 10 = 8 weeks

So, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks. \boxed{8}</s>","Melanie has already saved 10 toothpicks x 12 weeks = <<10*12=120>>120 toothpicks.

1. The original price of the watch is not given, but we'll call it O.

2. Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so he paid 0.75 * O.

3. He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for, so his friend paid 1.2 * (0.75 * O) = 0.9 * O.

4. The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price is (O - 0.9 * O) / O * 100%.

5. Simplifying this expression gives us (1 - 0.9) * O / O * 100% = 0.1 * 100% = 10%.

\boxed{10}% discount was obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price.</s>","Mr. Roger bought the perfume at $2000 x 75/100 = $<<2000*75/100=1500>>1500.

So, Mr. Roger's friend paid $2000 - $1800 = $<<2000-1800=200>>200 less than the original price.
So, his friend got $200/$2000 x 100% = <<200/2000*100=10>>10% discount.

1. We know that every second, a bubbling spring ! creates a new jellyfish.

2. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. So, in one hour, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds.

3. In one hour, each spring would create 3600 jellyfish.

4. Now, if there are 5 springs all working at the same rate, they would create 5 * 3600 = 18,000 jellyfish in one hour.

5. In 4 hours, 5 springs would create 4 * 18,000 = 72,000 jellyfish.

So, the final answer is {72,000 jellyfish}.</s>","Since an hour has 3600 seconds, if every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, it will create 4*3600 = <<4*3600=14400>>14400 jellyfish in four hours.

                [/INST] First, we need to calculate the total distance James walked. Since he walked halfway to the store and then walked back home, he walked the distance from the halfway point to the store, then the distance from the halfway point to his home, and finally the distance from his home to the halfway point to the store again. This is a total of 3 times the distance from the halfway point to the store.

The halfway point to the store is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.

So, James walked 3 times 2 miles = 6 miles.

Next, we need to calculate the time it took James to walk this distance. He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, so we divide the total distance he walked by his walking speed to get the total time.

Total time = Total distance / Speed = 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.

So, it took James 1.5 hours to walk to the store.

1. First, let's find out how many bananas Jenny is buying in total. If she buys 10 bunches and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas, then she buys 10 * 4 = 40 bananas in total.

2. Next, let's calculate how much it would cost her to buy these bananas individually. If each banana costs $0.80, then 40 bananas would cost 40 * $0.80 = $32.

3. Now, let's calculate how much it would cost for her to buy these bananas in bunches. If each bunch costs $3.00 and she buys 10 bunches, then it would cost her 10 * $3.00 = $30.

4. Finally, let's find out how much money she saved by buying the bananas in bunches. If it costs her $32 to buy the bananas individually and $30 to buy them in bunches, then she saved $32 - $30 = $2.

                [/INST] Here's how we can break it down:

1. We know that the total length of the fences is 100 feet.
2. The question states Harry's fencing is 60 feet more than Sam's. So, let's denote the number of feet Sam gets as X. This means Harry will get X+60 feet.
3. Since the fences have to add up to 100 feet, we can set up the equation: X + (X+60) = 100
4. Simplifying this equation: 2X + 60 = 100
5. Subtracting 60 from both sides: 2X = 40
6. Dividing both sides by 2 to solve for X: X = 20

Therefore, the final answer is that Sam has 20 feet of fencing. {The final answer is 20 feet}.</s>","Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold.

- There are 300 bikes in total, and half of them are Trekking bikes, so Marcel sold 300/2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

- 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes, so Marcel sold 300*0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

- The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes, so Marcel sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

2. Next, we need to calculate the price of each type of bike.

- The price of one MTB bike is $500.

- The price of one BMX bike is half the price of an MTB bike, so it's 500/2 = $250.

- The price of one Trekking bike is $450.

3. Finally, we can calculate Marcel's earnings from selling bikes.

- Marcel earned 105*$500 = $52,500 from selling MTB bikes.

- Marcel earned 45*$250 = $11,250 from selling BMX bikes.

- Marcel earned 150*$450 = $67,500 from selling Trekking bikes.

- In total, Marcel earned $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

{The final answer is \boxed{131,250}}</s>","First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.

1. The farmer makes 5 bales of hay every hour.

2. The truck picks up 3 bales of hay every hour.

3. They both work for a 6-hour day.

4. To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the net number of bales of hay made and then subtract the total number of bales picked up.

Let's calculate the net number of bales of hay made:

Net bales made per hour = Bales made by farmer per hour - Bales picked up per hour
= 5 - 3
= 2 bales

Since they work for 6 hours, the total net bales made in a day would be:

Total net bales made = Net bales made per hour * Hours worked
= 2 * 6
= 12 bales

So, after 6 hours, 12 bales of hay are made net. The number of bales picked up in a day would be:

Bales picked up = Bales picked up per hour * Hours worked
= 3 * 6
= 18 bales

Since the truck picks up bales, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the total net bales made to find out how many bales are left in the field:

Bales left in the field = Total net bales made - Bales picked up
= 12 - 18
= -6 bales

However, since it's not possible to have negative bales in the field, it means that all the bales made by the farmer were picked up by the truck. Therefore, the number of bales left in the field is zero.

{The final answer is: 0 bales}</s>","The farmer makes 5*6= <<5*6=30>>30 bales of hay.

1. **Determine the total number of classes John has per day**: John has 6 periods in a normal day, plus 2 extra classes. So, the total number of classes he takes per day is:
\[6 + 2 = 8\]

2. **Calculate the total number of classes per week**: Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total number of classes he takes per week is:
\[8 \times 5 = 40\]

3. **Find the total number of minutes John spends in class per week**: Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total number of minutes he spends in class per week is:
\[40 \times 40 = 1600\]

4. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in extra learning time on weekends**: John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. Therefore, the total number of minutes he spends on extra learning time on weekends is:
\[1/16 \times 1600 \times 2 = 200\]

5. **Find the total number of minutes John spends learning per week**: Adding the minutes spent in class to the minutes spent on extra learning time gives us:
\[1600 + 200 = 1800\]

6. **Convert the total minutes per week into hours**: Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total number of hours John spends learning per week is:
\[1800 / 60 = 30\]

Therefore, John spends $\boxed{30}$ hours learning per week.</s>","He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day

                    Nathan has a bouncy ball that bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. If ? he drops it ! from the third-floor balcony ? in the mall, where each story is 24 feet high, how high does the ball go on ! its second bounce?
                [/INST] The question involves understanding the concept of bouncing height and determining the height after multiple bounces. Here's how to solve it step by step:

1. **Determine the total height from which the ball is dropped**: Nathan is on the third-floor balcony, with each story being 24 feet high. Therefore, the total height is:
   - Total height = Height of one story * Number of stories
   - Total height = 24 feet * 3
   - Total height = 72 feet

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce**: After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3rds of its original height. So, the height after the first bounce is:
   - First bounce height = Total height * 2/3
   - First bounce height = 72 feet * 2/3
   - First bounce height = 48 feet

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce**: After the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3rds of the height it reached on the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
   - Second bounce height = First bounce height * 2/3
   - Second bounce height = 48 feet * 2/3
   - Second bounce height = 32 feet

So, after the second bounce, the ball reaches a height of 32 feet. {The final answer is 32 feet.}</s>","First find the total height from which Nathan drops the ball: 24 feet/story * 3 stories = <<24*3=72>>72 feet
Then multiply that number by 2/3rds to find the height of the ball after one bounce: 72 feet * 2/3 = <<72*2/3=48>>48 feet
Then multiply that number by 2/3rds to find the height of the ball after two bounces: 48 feet * 2/3 = <<48*2/3=32>>32 feet

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag.

Total bags = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200 bags

2. Next, we need to calculate the total earnings. Since each bag is sold for $5, we can do this by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag.

Total earnings = Number of bags * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

So, the final answer is {The orchard earned $1000}.</s>","There were 2000/10 = <<2000/10=200>>200 bags of apples sold.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. This means that there is still half of the triceratops left.
2. Then, the pack of velociraptors ate half of what was left. This means that there is now one quarter of the original triceratops left.
3. The Allosaurus ate the remaining 270 kilograms of meat. This means that the remaining one quarter of the triceratops was 270 kilograms.
4. To find out how many kilograms the original triceratops weighed, we need to find out how many times 270 kilograms is one quarter of the triceratops. In other words, we multiply 270 kilograms by 4.

The calculation is as follows:

270 * 4 = 1080 kilograms

                [/INST] First, we need to calculate the total area of all the walls that Tony is painting.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall is 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall is 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

So, the total area of all the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are needed to cover this area. Since each gallon covers 20 square feet, we divide the total area by the coverage of one gallon:

240 / 20 = 12 gallons

Finally, to find the total cost of the paint, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:

12 * $12 = $144

{The final answer is the cost to paint the room, so \boxed{144}}.</s>","The north and south walls are 80 square feet each because 10 x 8 = <<10*8=80>>80
The east and west walls are 40 square feet because 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40

The East and west walls total 80 square feet because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
All the walls total 240 square feet because 160 + 80 = <<160+80=240>>240
He will need 12 gallons of paint because 240 / 20 = <<240/20=12>>12

                [/INST] Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda if any of the 3 shaken sodas are taken.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed from a shaken soda.
    - There are 4 sodas left (3 shaken and 1 unshaken) when Ellen's friend arrives.
    - The chance that Ellen's friend gets sprayed from the first shaken soda is 3/4.
    - If the first soda is shaken, there is 1 shaken soda left and 3 total sodas. The probability of getting sprayed is then 3/5.
    - If the first soda is not shaken, there are 3 shaken sodas and 3 total sodas left. The probability of getting sprayed is 3/3 or 1, meaning it's certain she gets sprayed.

Step 2: Calculate the probability of Ellen's friend's second try being shaken.
    - The probability that Ellen's friend picks the shaken soda is 3/4.
    - If the shaken soda is picked, the probability of it being shaken is 1, since it's already shaken.
    - If the unshaken soda is picked, the probability of it being shaken is 0, since it's not shaken.

Step 3: Calculate the probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed from the second try.
    - The combined probability of getting sprayed from the first and second tries is (3/4) * ((3/5) * (3/4) + (1/5) * 0) = 3/10.

So, the final answer is:

Then figure out how many shaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 shaken sodas.
Now add the number of shaken and unshaken sodas to find the total number of sodas left when Ellen's friend came along: 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 sodas
Now divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas to find the decimal probability Ellen's friend gets sprayed: 2/8 = <<2/8=0.25>>0.25

Step 2: The speed of the second train (?) is half of the first train's speed, which is 60/2 = 30 miles per hour.

Step 3: After 3 hours, the distance covered by the first train (!) would be its speed (60 miles per hour) multiplied by the time (3 hours), which equals 60*3 = 180 miles.

Step 4: Similarly, the distance covered by the second train (?) after 3 hours would be its speed (30 miles per hour) multiplied by the time (3 hours), which equals 30*3 = 90 miles.

Step 5: Since they are moving in opposite directions, the total distance between them would be the sum of the distances they individually covered in 3 hours.

Step 6: Therefore, the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

1. **Calculate the number of days Billy works in March**: March has 31 days. If Billy takes 20% of the days off, the number of days he works in March is $31 - 0.2 \times 31$.
   \[
   31 - 0.2 \times 31 = 31 - 6.2 = 24.8
   \]
   Since Billy cannot work a fraction of a day, we round this to 25 days.

2. **Calculate the number of days Billy works in March and April**: There are 31 days in March and 19 days in April, but since Billy works part-time, we need to consider the overlap. He works 25 days in March and continues in April, so we count all 19 days of April.
   \[
   25 + 19 = 44
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of people Billy helps**: Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the total number of people he helps per day is $2 \times 3 = 6$. Over the 44 days, he helps a total of $6 \times 44$.

1. First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch each day. He takes a 30-minute lunch, so after 5 days, he would have spent 30 minutes * 5 = 150 minutes on lunch.

2. Next, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on breaks each day. He takes two 15-minute breaks, so that's 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes per day on breaks.

3. After 5 days, Bobby would have taken 30 minutes * 5 = 150 minutes on breaks as well.

4. Now, let's add the total time spent on lunch and breaks over 5 days: 150 minutes (lunch) + 150 minutes (breaks) = 300 minutes.

5. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total minutes to hours: 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

He also has a 30-minute lunch every day so together with his 30-minute break he has a 30+30 = 60-minute break each day
Every day his breaks total 60 minutes and he takes these breaks 5 days per week so he takes 60*5 = <<60*5=300>>300 minutes of break time

1. Amber ran 8 miles.
2. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. So, Micah ran = 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.
3. The total distance run by Amber and Micah = 8 (Amber) + 28 (Micah) = 36 miles.
4. Since Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles, the distance Ahito ran = Total distance - Amber's distance - Micah's distance = 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

So, Ahito ran \boxed{16} miles.</s>","Amber ran <<8=8>>8 miles.

What is the new balance on her credit card?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate Sheila's new credit card balance step by step, taking into account her initial charge, the returned item, and her subsequent purchases.

1. **Initial Charge:**
   Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.

2. **Returned Item:**
   She returned an item that cost $15.00. This reduces her credit card balance.
   \[
   \text{New Balance after Return} = \$85.00 - \$15.00 = \$70.00
   \]

3. **Frying Pan Purchase:**
   The frying pan was on sale for 20% off of its original price of $20.00. The discount can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Discount on Frying Pan} = 20\% \times \$20.00 = 0.20 \times \$20.00 = \$4.00
   \]
   Therefore, the price Sheila paid for the frying pan after the discount is:
   \[
   \text{Price after Discount} = \$20.00 - \$4.00 = \$16.00
   \]

4. **Set of Towels Purchase:**
   The set of towels was on sale for 10% off of its original price of $30.00. The discount can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Discount on Towels} = 10\% \times \$30.00 = 0.10 \times \$30.00 = \$3.00
   \]
   Therefore, the price Sheila paid for the towels after the discount is:
   \[
   \text{Price after Discount} = \$30.00 - \$3.00 = \$27.00
   \]

5. **New Credit Card Balance:**
   Adding the prices of the frying pan and the towels to her balance after the return, we get:
   \[
   \text{New Balance} = \$70.00 + \$16.00 + \$27.00 = \$113.00
   \]

Therefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $\boxed{113}$.</s>","She charged $85.00 on her card and just returned a $15.00 purchase so right now, her credit card has 85-15 = $<<85-15=70.00>>70.00 balance

The frying pan costs $20.00 and the discount price is $4.00 so the new price is 20-4=$<<20-4=16.00>>16.00
The towel set is 10% off of $30.00 so .10*30 = $<<10*.01*30=3.00>>3.00
The towel set costs $30.00 and the discount price is $3.00 so the new price is 30-3= $<<30-3=27.00>>27.00
Her new purchases total 16+27 = $$<<16+27=43.00>>43.00
After the return, her card balance was $70.00 and she just added $43.00 in purchases so her new balance is 70+43 = $<<70+43=113.00>>113.00

1. The problem states that a fifth of the jellyfish are large and a third of these large jellyfish change color when UV light is turned on.

2. The number of jellyfish that change color under UV light is given as 6, which are the large jellyfish that change from green to blue.

3. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, we can find out how many large jellyfish there are by multiplying 6 by 3. This gives us 18 large jellyfish.

4. However, these 18 jellyfish only make up a fifth of the total number of jellyfish in the tank. Therefore, to find the total number of jellyfish, we multiply 18 by 5.

The calculation would be:

Total jellyfish = Large jellyfish * 5
= 18 * 5
= 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual savings**: Lauren saves 20% of her salary every paycheck. Her current salary is $100,000. Therefore, her annual savings can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 20\% \times \$100,000 = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount needed for retirement**: Lauren aims to save enough to live off 40% of her current annual salary for 20 years. The total amount needed can be calculated by:
   \[
   \text{Total amount needed} = 20 \times 40\% \times \$100,000 = 20 \times 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$800,000

3. **Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work**: To find out how many more years Lauren needs to work to reach her retirement goal, we divide the total amount needed by her annual savings:
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for $\boxed{40}$ more years to save enough for her retirement plan.</s>","Lauren plans to live in retirement with 40% of her current salary ($100,000), therefore 40%*$100,000 = $<<40*.01*100000=40000>>40,000
If she wants to save for 20 years, then she will need to save 20 * $40,000 = $<<20*40000=800000>>800,000 to retire
If her current salary is $100,00 and she's saving 20%, then she's able to save $100,000 * 20% = $<<100000*20*.01=20000>>20,000 every year

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of parts Marty initially wants to cut it into (4 parts). This gives us the length of each initial part:

   100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

2. Next, each of these 25 cm parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. So, we divide the length of each initial part (25 cm) by the number of parts each initial part needs to be divided into (5 parts):

   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

Therefore, {The final answer is 5 cm}.</s>","The 100-centimeter ribbon is cut into 4 equal parts in pieces of 100 / 4 = <<100/4=25>>25 cm

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out what 40% of the total school population is equal to, which is the number of boys. According to the problem, the number of boys is 240.

2. Next, we need to understand that if 40% of the school population are boys, then the rest of the school population must be girls. Since 100% - 40% = 60%, this means that 60% of the school population are girls.

3. Now, we know that 60% of the school population corresponds to the number of girls. But we don't know the total school population yet. We can find it by setting up a proportion, since we know that 40% (or 0.4) of the total school population equals 240 boys.

So, 0.4 * Total School Population = 240

4. To find the total school population, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:
   
   Total School Population = 240 / 0.4

5. Now that we know the total school population, we can calculate the number of girls by finding 60% of the total school population:
   
   Number of Girls = 0.6 * Total School Population

Let's calculate the number of girls step by step:

Total School Population = 240 / 0.4 = 600

Number of Girls = 0.6 * 600 = 360

Thus, the final answer is \boxed{360}.</s>","100% - 40% = 60% of the school's population are girls.
Since 40% is equal to 240 students, then 1% is equal to 240/40 = <<240/40=6>>6 students.
Hence, there are 60 x 6 = <<60*6=360>>360 girls.

3. The total cost before the coupon is $19 (for the pots) + $26 (for the soil) = $45.
4. She used a coupon for $7 off, so she subtracts $7 from the total cost.

The total height of all the women in 4-inch heels is (3W + 12) inches, because three women have 4-inch heels and three women have 2-inch heels.

The total height of all the women in 2-inch heels is (3W + 6) inches, because three women have 2-inch heels.

The total height of all the women in heels is (3W + 12 + 3W + 6) = 6W + 18 inches.

Total miles to hike = 9,300 miles (given)

Next, let's calculate how many miles she will hike each day if she follows the current plan of walking twice a day:

Miles hiked each day (current plan) = 125 miles per walk * 2 walks per day
= 250 miles per day

Now, let's calculate how many days there are in June:

Days in June = 30 days (since June has 30 days)

Then, let's calculate how many miles she will hike in total during June:

Total miles in June (current plan) = Miles hiked each day (current plan) * Days in June
= 250 miles per day * 30 days
= 7500 miles

This is less than the total miles she wants to hike (9,300 miles), so she needs to hike more each day to reach her goal:

Increased miles hiked each day = Total miles to hike / Days in June
= 9,300 miles / 30 days
= 310 miles per day

Finally, let's calculate how many more miles Soledad needs to hike per day:

Additional miles hiked each day = Increased miles hiked each day - Miles hiked each day (current plan)
= 310 miles per day - 250 miles per day
= 60 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

                [/INST] First, let's find out how much Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought:

Pierre bought 1/4 of the apples, so he bought (12 kg * 1/4) = 3 kg.
Paul wanted 1/3 of the apples, so he bought (12 kg * 1/3) = 4 kg.
Jacques bought the remaining apples. Since Pierre and Paul bought a combined total of (3 kg + 4 kg) = 7 kg, Jacques bought (12 kg - 7 kg) = 5 kg.

Now, let's find out how many kilograms James will have left:

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought a combined total of (3 kg + 4 kg + 5 kg) = 12 kg, and all of the apples were already accounted for, James must have bought the same amount of apples as Pierre, which is 3 kg. However, since James is typically a nickname for Jacques, it seems there may be a mistake in the question. Assuming James is a different person, we can say:

\boxed{James will have 3 kg left.}</s>","Peter wants 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 kg of apples.
Paul wants 12 * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 kg of apples.

First, Raymond starts with $21.

Then, he saves another $11, so his total savings at this point are $21 + $11 = $32.

Next, he spends $5 on a comic book. So, his money now is $32 - $5 = $27.

Finally, he spends $19 on a puzzle. So, the money left with him is $27 - $19 = $8.

1. Anna has a budget of $16 and has already spent $4. This means she has $16 - $4 = $12 left to spend on books.
2. She has $2 left after buying 2 books, so the total cost of the 2 books is $12 - $2 = $10.
3. Since both books cost the same amount, we divide the total cost by the number of books to find the cost of each book: $10 / 2 = $5.

Therefore, each book cost $5. {The final answer is $5}.</s>","Anna had already spent some money, so she started the day with $16 – $4 = $<<16-4=12>>12.

1. We start with 50 students last year.
2. The enrollment increased by 20%. To find out by how many students the enrollment increased, we calculate 20% of 50.
   - 20% of 50 is calculated as (20/100) * 50 = 10.
3. So, 10 students were added to the enrollment.
4. To find out the total number of students this year, we add the increase to the original number of students.

1. We know that Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
2. Megan's chore of walking the dog took her 2 hours longer than Amalia's. So, Megan's chore took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
3. Dior's chore of doing laundry took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia's. Let's assume that Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours (but this is a ""well over"" scenario, so in reality, it could be more).

Now, to find the total time they all took to do their chores altogether, we add up the time each person took:

4 hours (Amalia) + 6 hours (Megan) + 8 hours (Dior) = 18 hours

So, the final answer is: {The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.}.</s>","Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to do her work, a total of 4+2 = 6 hours.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break down this problem:

1. First, we need to calculate the distance John drives in one trip to his parents. He drives at a speed of 70 mph for 2 hours. So, the distance he covers in one trip is:
   Distance = Speed * Time
   Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
   Distance = 140 miles

2. Since it's a round trip, we need to double this distance to account for the return trip. So, the total distance he drives for one visit is:
   2 * 140 miles = 280 miles

3. John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:
   Total distance = Distance per visit * Number of visits
   Total distance = 280 miles * 2 visits
   Total distance = 560 miles

So, the final answer is:

                [/INST] To solve the problem, we follow these steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between Sofie's and Brian's distances**: We are told that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let's denote the distance Brian walks in 7 days as $D_B$. Therefore, the distance Sofie walks in 7 days is $2D_B$.

2. **Calculate Sofie's daily distance**: Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, the total distance Sofie walks is $10 \times 7 = 70$ miles. Since this is twice the distance Brian walks, we have $2D_B = 70$ miles.

3. **Solve for Brian's total distance in 7 days**: Given that $2D_B = 70$ miles, we can find Brian's total distance by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. This gives us $D_B = \frac{70}{2} = 35$ miles.

4. **Conclude with the final answer**: The total distance Brian will walk in seven days is $\boxed{35}$ miles. {The final answer is 35 miles}.</s>","If Sofie walks 10 miles each day, she will walk 7*10 = <<10*7=70>>70 miles in seven days.

1. First, let's calculate how many toys the first two workers can produce in a 10-hour shift: 6 toys/hour * 10 hours * 2 workers = 120 toys.
2. Next, let's calculate how many toys the next two workers can produce in a 10-hour shift: 4 toys/hour * 10 hours * 2 workers = 80 toys.
3. So far, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in a 10-hour shift is: 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.
4. However, at the end of their shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order. This means that the total number of toys needed in a 10-hour shift is: 400 toys (the total order) - 20 toys (still needed) = 380 toys.
5. Therefore, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys in a 10-hour shift: 380 toys (total needed in 10 hours) - 200 toys (produced by first four workers) = 180 toys.
6. Finally, to find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to divide the number of toys produced by the length of the shift: 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour.

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour. {The final answer is \boxed{18} toys/hour}</s>","In the first group of workers, each produces 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys.
In the second group of workers, each produces 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys.
Together, these two groups produce 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys.
If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.
The fifth worker therefore produced 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.

1. Let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as S.

2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, Luis received S/2 stickers.

3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, which means he used (S/2)/2 = S/4 stickers.

4. This means Luis had S/2 - S/4 = S/4 stickers left.

5. Luis gave these remaining stickers to Kris.

6. Kris kept 9 of these stickers. So, Kris had 9 + the number of stickers Rob had = 9 + 7 (since Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob).

7. Therefore, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

8. This means Luis had 16 stickers initially before he gave some to Kris.

9. Since Luis used S/4 stickers, he must have had 16 - S/4 stickers before he used some.

10. This means S/2 = 16 - S/4 (since Luis received S/2 stickers from Seth).

1. First, let's find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. If the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, and the average car can go 120 miles per hour, then the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = Speed of average car * 5
= 120 miles per hour * 5
= 600 miles per hour

2. Next, let's find the speed of the fastest car. If the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, then the speed of the fastest car is:

Speed of fastest car = Speed of 2nd fastest car * 1.25
= 600 miles per hour * 1.25
= 750 miles per hour

So, the final answer is:

{The final answer is 750 miles per hour.}</s>","The 2nd fastest car can go 600 MPH because 5 x 120 = <<5*120=600>>600
The faster car can go 750 MPH because 1.25 x 600 = <<1.25*600=750>>750

                    question:
                    Liam is 16 years old , now. Two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince. How ? old is Vince now?
                [/INST] Let's denote Vince's age now as V.

Step 1:
Two years ago, Liam was younger than he is now. Specifically, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Step 2:
At the same time, Vince was 2 years older than he is now. So, Vince was V + 2 years old two years ago.

Step 3:
According to the problem, Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age at that time. So, we can write this relationship as:

14 = 2 * (V + 2)

Step 4:
Now, let's solve for V:

Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get:

7 = V + 2

Subtract 2 from both sides to get:

9 = V

Step 5:
So, Vince is currently 9 years old.

\boxed{9}</s>","Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = <<16-2=14>>14 years old.
Vince's age two years ago was 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 years old because Liam's age is twice his.
So Vince age now is 7 + 2 = <<7+2=9>>9 years old.

                    question:
                    Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted ; 56 easter eggs. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Camden and Sarah painted , a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. How many more eggs ; did : Camden paint than Arnold?
                [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted as A, and the number of eggs Camden and Sarah painted as C and S respectively.

Step 2: From the problem, we know that A + A (since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs) + C + S = 56 (total number of eggs painted), and C + S = 30 (total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah).

Step 3: Also, from the problem, we know that C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah).

Step 4: Now, we can substitute C from step 3 into the equation in step 2. So, we get A + A + S + 12 + S = 56, which simplifies to 2A + 2S + 12 = 56.

Step 5: We also know that C + S = 30, which can be rewritten as S + 12 + S = 30 (substituting C from step 3), and this simplifies to 2S + 12 = 30.

Step 6: Solving for S in step 5, we get S = 9.

Step 7: Substituting S = 9 into the equation in step 4, we get 2A + 2*9 + 12 = 56, which simplifies to 2A + 45 = 56.

Step 8: Solving for A in step 7, we get A = 56 - 45 / 2 = 56 - 22.5 = 33.5. But since we can't have half an egg, there seems to be a mistake in the problem.

Step 9: Let's assume the total number of eggs is 58 instead of 56. Then we get C = S + 12 = S + 12 = 30 - S, which simplifies to S = 9, as before. And A = 58 - 2*(30 - 9) = 58 - 32 = 26.

Step 10: The question asks how many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold. So, the difference is C - A = (S + 12) - A = 9 + 12 - 26 = 3.

Step 11: Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{3}.</s>","Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = <<56-30=26>>26 easter eggs.
Arnold and Madeline each painted 26/2 = <<26/2=13>>13 easter eggs.
Sarah painted (30 - 12)/2 = 18/2 = <<(30-12)/2=9>>9 easter eggs.
Camden painted 9 + 12 = <<9+12=21>>21 easter eggs.
Camden painted 21 - 13 = <<21-13=8>>8 eggs more than Arnold.

If he puts all of his crayons into ; boxes, what . is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, when there are 16 ounces to a pound?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into clear, step-by-step calculations:

1. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**
   Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to separate them into groups of 8 crayons each. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box:
   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/box}} = 25 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so to find the total weight of all the crayons, we multiply the number of crayons by the weight of each crayon:
   \[
   200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces, so to find the total weight of all the boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the weight of each box:
   \[
   25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight in pounds:**
   Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight of the crayons and the boxes by 16 to find the weight in pounds:
   \[
   (200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces}) \div 16 \text{ ounces/pound} = 25 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, when there are 16 ounces to a pound, is $\boxed{25}$ pounds.</s>","First find how many boxes Nik needs. 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = <<200/8=25>>25 boxes.
25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = <<25*8=200>>200 ounces.
Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so 200 + 200 = <<200+200=400>>400 ounces.
400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = <<400/16=25>>25 pounds.

                [/INST] First, we need to find out how many logs John can make from the tree. He can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree, so:
Logs = 80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

He cuts each log into 4-foot logs, so:
Number of logs = 64 feet / 4 feet/log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so:
Total number of planks = 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so:
Total earnings = 80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is {he makes $96}.</s>","He can use 80*.8=<<80*.8=64>>64 feet of the tree.

1. Valerie earns $5000 per month.
2. Valerie's brother earns twice as much as she does.

Step 1: Calculate Valerie's brother's salary
Valerie bro's salary = Valerie's salary * 2
                         = $5000 * 2
                         = $10000

3. Their mother earns twice their combined salary.

Step 2: Calculate the mother's salary
Combined salary of Valerie and her brother = $5000 (Valerie's) + $10000 (brother's)
                                                            = $15000

                         = $30000

Finally, let's find the total amount of money they all earn together.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money earned by all three.
Total amount = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary + Mother's salary
                     = $5000 + $10000 + $30000

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk in her 3-mile walk.
2. We also know that Grandma spends 40 minutes of her walk on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach, we can calculate her walking speed on the beach: speed = distance / time = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.
3. We are told that Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. So, her walking speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.05 miles per minute = 0.1 miles per minute.
4. We now know how long it takes Grandma to walk the entire 3 miles. The time it takes Grandma to walk the 2 miles on the beach is 40 minutes (which we were given), and the time it takes Grandma to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.
5. Therefore, the total time it takes Grandma to walk the entire 3 miles is 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Final answer: {The final answer is 50 minutes}.</s>","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels before the discount.
The cost of one pack is $10.00, so the cost of 4 packs would be:
$10.00 * 4 = $40.00

Step 2: Calculate the discount on the total cost.
The discount is 10% of $40.00, which is:
$40.00 * 10% = $4.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost after the discount.
Subtract the discount from the original cost:
$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Step 4: Calculate the cost of each single bagel.
Each pack contains 9 bagels, so the cost of each bagel in one pack would be:
$10.00 / 9 = $1.11 (rounded to two decimal places)

But since Russell is getting a discount, we need to divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels in 4 packs. The total number of bagels in 4 packs is:
9 * 4 = 36 bagels

So, the cost of each single bagel after the discount would be:
$36.00 / 36 = $1.00

{The final answer is each single bagel will cost $1.00}</s>","He orders 4 packs of bagels and each pack costs $10.00 so that's 4*10 = $<<4*10=40.00>>40.00
He orders 4 packs at $40.00 and receives a 10% discount so his discount is 40*.10 = $4.00
The bagels cost $40.00 and he has a $4.00 discount making his total 40-4 = $<<40-4=36.00>>36.00
Each pack of bagels has 9 bagels per pack and he orders 4 packs so that's 9*4 = <<9*4=36>>36 bagels
His order total was $36.00 and there are 36 bagels so each bagel costs 36/36 = $<<36/36=1.00>>1.00

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. Therefore, Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Step 2: Determine the number of potatoes needed to make one scoop of mashed potatoes
It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be written as:
(6 - 3) potatoes = (3 - 1) scoops
3 potatoes = 2 scoops
Therefore, 1.5 potatoes = 1 scoop

Step 3: Determine the number of potatoes Gomer ate
Since Gomer ate 18 scoops, and each scoop requires 1.5 potatoes, Gomer ate 18 * 1.5 = 27 potatoes.

The final answer is {27}</s>","5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes is 23-5=<<23-5=18>>18 scoops of mashed potatoes.
3 less than 6 potatoes is 6-3=<<6-3=3>>3 potatoes.

1. **First 30 days:** Chester eats 3 eggs per day. So, for 30 days, the total number of eggs eaten is:
\[30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ eggs}\]

2. **Next 30 days:** After increasing his consumption, Chester eats 5 eggs per day. So, for the next 30 days, the total number of eggs eaten is:
\[30 \times 5 = 150 \text{ eggs}\]

3. **Total eggs eaten:** To find out how many eggs Chester eats in total over the 60 days, we add the eggs eaten in the first 30 days to the eggs eaten in the next 30 days:
\[90 + 150 = 240 \text{ eggs}\]

4. **Converting eggs to dozens:** Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[240 \div 12 = 20 \text{ dozens}\]

Therefore, the total number of dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days is $\boxed{20}$.</s>","He starts off eating 3 eggs a day for 30 days for a total of 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 eggs

If there are a total of 60 jelly beans in total, how many blue jellybeans are there?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to find out the number of blue jelly beans. We know that there are 17 green jelly beans and twice as many red jelly beans. Let's calculate the number of red jelly beans first.

Red jelly beans = 2 * Green jelly beans
               = 2 * 17
               = 34

Now, we know the total number of jelly beans (green, red, and blue) is 60. So, we can calculate the number of blue jelly beans by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total.

Blue jelly beans = Total jelly beans - (Green jelly beans + Red jelly beans)
                 = 60 - (17 + 34)
                 = 60 - 51

1. First, we need to calculate how many lemons Tim collects from one tree in a year. According to the problem, Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree in a year. So, if he has 5 trees, the calculation would be:

Lemons from one tree in a year = Number of trees * Lemons per tree
= 5 trees * 6 lemons/tree
= 30 lemons

2. Next, we need to calculate how many lemons Tim collects in a decade (10 years) from all his trees. We do this by multiplying the number of lemons he collects in a year by 10:

Lemons in a decade = Lemons from one tree in a year * Number of years
= 30 lemons * 10 years
= 300 lemons

So, Tim collects a total of 300 lemons in a decade.

Therefore, {The final answer is: 300}.</s>","He gets 5*6=<<5*6=30>>30 lemons per year

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we start by understanding the ratio of men to women on the bus, which is given as 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of passengers on the bus is 84.

First, we find the total parts in the ratio by adding the parts for men and women:
\[5 + 9 = 14\]

This means the total ratio of passengers is divided into 14 parts. Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total number of passengers by the total number of parts:
\[84 \div 14 = 6\]

This means each part represents 6 passengers. Since there are 9 parts for women, the total number of women on the bus before any alight is:
\[9 \times 6 = 54\]

Given that 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women who have remained on the bus is $\boxed{34}$.</s>","The total ratio representing the number of women on the bus is 5+9=<<5+9=14>>14
The fraction from the ratio representing the number of women is 9/14, and since the total number of passengers representing the full ratio is 84, there are 9/14*84=<<9/14*84=54>>54 women on the bus.

Faraday earned $26 from the sunflower and $56 from the bouquet per day, and ! if each bouquet ! has 12 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Faraday able to sell after 3 days?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller, manageable steps:

1. **Determine the number of sunflowers sold per day**:
   - We know that Faraday sells each sunflower for $2 and earns $26 from selling sunflowers daily. Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day can be calculated by dividing the total earnings from sunflowers by the price per sunflower.
   \[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from sunflowers}}{\text{Price per sunflower}} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

2. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers and bouquets sold per day**:
   - We are given that Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets daily, and each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. The price of each bouquet is $8.
   - First, let's find out how many bouquets are sold daily:
     \[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets}}{\text{Price per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]
   - Since each bouquet consists of 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets sold per day is:
     \[ \text{Total sunflowers in bouquets} = \text{Number of bouquets} \times \text{Sunflowers per bouquet} = 7 \times 12 = 84 \]
   - Adding the sunflowers sold individually to the total from bouquets gives us the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
     \[ \text{Total sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Sunflowers sold individually} + \text{Sunflowers in bouquets} = 13 + 84 = 97 \]

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days**:
   - To find out how many sunflowers Faraday is able to sell in 3 days, we multiply the daily total by 3:
     \[ \text{Total sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

Therefore, Faraday is able to sell a total of $\boxed{291}$ sunflowers after 3 days.</s>","Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.

                [/INST] To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of winning for each ticket.

Step 1: Mark's first lottery ticket has a 20% chance of winning. To express this as a decimal, we divide by 100. So the probability of winning for the first ticket is 0.20.

Step 2: The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first one. So its probability of winning is 0.20 * 3 = 0.60 or 60%.

Step 3: To find the probability that both tickets are winners, multiply the probabilities: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

Step 4: To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Final answer: {The probability that both tickets are winners is 12%}.</s>","First triple 20% to find the second ticket's chance of winning: .2 * 3 = <<.2*3=.6>>.6

                [/INST] First, let's find out how many seashells Carlos collected. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than Carlos, we can express this as:

Carlos' seashells = Jim's seashells - 5 = 27 - 5 = 22

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, we can express Carrey's seashells as:

Carrey's seashells = Carlos' seashells / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11

Now, let's find out the total number of seashells collected by all three. We know that the total number of seashells is the sum of Jim's, Carlos's, and Carrey's seashells. So, we can express this as:

Total seashells = Jim's seashells + Carlos' seashells + Carrey's seashells = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60

Finally, we need to find out how many seashells each person got when they divided them equally among themselves. Since there were three people, we can express this as:

Seashells each person got = Total seashells / Number of people = 60 / 3 = 20

{The final answer is} Each person got 20 seashells.</s>","Jim collected 27 seashells, 5 more than what Carlos collected, which means Carlos collected 27-5 = <<27-5=22>>22 seashells

1. First, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday to Friday), and he eats 4 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
   5 days * 4 carrots/day = 20 carrots

2. Next, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekend days. There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday), and he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekend days is:
   2 days * 5 carrots/day = 10 carrots

3. Finally, to find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the carrots he eats on weekdays and on weekend days:

1. The first song on the cassette is 5 minutes long.
2. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find out how much longer this is in minutes, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes. This is done by multiplying 5 minutes by 60/100 (which is the decimal equivalent of 60%). So, 5 * 60/100 = 3 minutes.
3. Therefore, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.
4. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of the first and second songs together. So, 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

5. In total, he sold 2 devices * 2 (days) = 4 devices, and his total revenue is $80 (Monday) + $160 (Tuesday) = $240.

6. His total expenses for buying the devices are 2 devices (Monday) + 4 devices (Tuesday) = 4 devices * $20 (original price) = $80.

How many more bottles of juices would Hortex have to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 , people?
                [/INST] First, let's calculate the daily energy demand of one person as a percentage of the juice produced by Hortex for one person.

Daily energy demand of one person = 100%
Percentage covered by one bottle of juice = 20%

To find the number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy demand of one person, we divide 100% by 20%.

Number of bottles required for one person = 100% / 20% = 5 bottles

Now, let's calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people:

Total energy demand of 2300 people = 2300 * 100% = 230000%

Next, we need to find out how many bottles are required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people:

Total bottles required for 2300 people = Total energy demand of 2300 people / Percentage covered by one bottle = 230000% / 20% = 115000 bottles

Finally, we can calculate how many more bottles Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Additional bottles required = Total bottles required - Current production = 115000 bottles - 4200 bottles = 110800 bottles

So, Hortex would have to produce an additional 110,800 bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

{The final answer is 110,800}</s>","Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.
So 2300 people, need 5 * 2300 = <<2300*5=11500>>11500 juices for this purpose.
To cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles of juices.

1. Carla has 8 identical octuplets.

2. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple, which is 3/4 * 8 = 6 octuplets.

3. She dresses 1/4 of them in blue, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 octuplets.

4. All the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows.

5. Since all the blue wearers wear bows, that's 2 bows from the blue-dressed octuplets.

6. 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, which is 1/3 * 6 = 2 octuplets.

7. So, in total, there are 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 octuplets wearing bows.

8. Out of these 4, only 2 are wearing purple.

9. To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we use the formula: (Number of purple-wearers with bows / Total number of baby-wearers with bows) * 100%

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

2. The third apartment complex is 60% bigger than the first two combined. So, it has 400 + (60/100 * 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

3. John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment complex, so he collects garbage from 3 * 3 = 9 times in a week.

4. He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so for one collection from all the apartments he gets 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments, and for 9 collections he gets 9 * 1040 = 9360 dollars.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{9360}.</s>","The first two complexes have 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 apartments

So in total, it has 400+240=<<400+240=640>>640 apartments
So he goes to 640+400=<<640+400=1040>>1040 apartments each time
That means he visits 1040*3=<<1040*3=3120>>3120 apartments every week

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the amount of a 5-year-old, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the amount of a 5-year-old, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let the 10-year-old produce X fruits, so the 8-year-old will produce X - 200 fruits. We don't have the exact number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces yet, so we'll come back to this later.
5. The 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruits, so 0 fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits (from a 5-year-old), which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. This also gives us the exact number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces (X = 1000).

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits produced during the 10 years:

5-year-old: 50 fruits
6-year-old: 150 fruits
7-year-old: 350 fruits
8-year-old: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits
9-year-old: 0 fruits
10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Adding them all up: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2050 fruits

{The final answer is 2050 fruits.}</s>","At 5 years it produces 50 fruits
At 6 years it produces 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 fruits.
At 7 years, it produces 50 * 7 = <<50*7=350>>350 fruits
At 10 years, it produces 50 * 20 = <<50*20=1000>>1000 fruits
At 8 years, it produces 200 fewer fruits than at 10 years, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits
During 10 years, an avocado tree can produce a total of 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = <<50+150+350+800+1000=2350>>2350 fruits

                [/INST] Let's think step by step:

1. We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope. Let's denote the length of the blue rope as 'x' centimeters.

2. This means the red rope is 4x centimeters long.

3. The problem also states that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as 'y' centimeters.

4. This means the blue rope is (y - 7) centimeters long. But we know this is 'x' centimeters, so we can say x = y - 7.

5. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we have the equation: x + 4x + y = 37.

6. Substituting x = y - 7 into the equation, we get: y - 7 + 4(y - 7) + y = 37.

7. Simplifying this equation, we get: 6y - 28 = 37.

8. Solving for y, we find: y = 15.5 centimeters.

9. Using x = y - 7, we find: x = 15.5 - 7 = 8.5 centimeters.

10. Finally, to find the length of the red rope, we use the fact that it is four times the length of the blue rope: 4 * 8.5 = 34 centimeters.

{The final answer is \boxed{34}} centimeters.</s>","Let Y = the length of the yellow rope in centimeters
Blue rope = Y - 7
Red rope = 4 * (Y - 7)

6Y = 72
Y = <<12=12>>12 cm

2. Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.
3. After giving the same amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original amount. This means she kept 4/5 of $15, which is $12.
4. Since both Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount of money to their sister, the amount they each gave equals the difference between their original amounts and their remaining amounts.
5. So, Ronnie gave $5 - (4/5 * $5) = $5 - $4 = $1 to the sister.
6. After giving $1 to the sister, Ronnie is left with $5 - $1 = $4.

                [/INST] The problem is about finding out how many pints of red paint were used in a mural, given that the mural is divided into four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. The mural uses equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and half of the mural is yellow. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. The mural is made up of two colors (red, white, and purple) and yellow.
2. Half of the mural is yellow. So, if the mural is half yellow, the other half is made up of red, white, and purple.
3. We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. Since half of the mural is yellow, the other half (red, white, and purple) must also use half of the total paint.
4. Half of the total paint (12 pints) is 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.
5. The red, white, and purple colors are used in equal amounts. So, if we divide the 6 pints (used for red, white, and purple) by 3 (the number of colors), we get the amount of each color.
6. The amount of red paint used is therefore 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

So, the mural used 2 pints of red paint. {The final answer is 2 pints}.</s>","Half the mural is yellow, so the other half took 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pints of paint.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the cost per pod for the regular box.

Cost per pod = Total cost of the box / Number of pods in the box
= $12 / 100
= $0.12 per pod

Next, let's calculate the number of pods in the special size box. The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box, so:

Number of pods in the special box = Number of pods in the regular box * (1 + 20%)
= 100 * 1.20
= 120 pods

Now, let's calculate the cost per pod for the special size box.

Cost per pod in the special box = Total cost of the special box / Number of pods in the special box
= $12 / 120
= $0.10 per pod

Since the question asks for the number of cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we need to divide $1 by the cost per pod of the special size box to find out how many pods you can afford.

Number of pods you can afford = $1 / Cost per pod in the special box
= $1 / $0.10
= 10 pods

Therefore, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles with the new box for $1 using 1 pod per cycle.

{The final answer is 10 cycles}</s>","If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods
If the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods
If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10

                [/INST] Thomas starts by withdrawing $1000 in $20 bills from his bank account. To find out how many 20 dollar bills he withdraws, we divide the total amount by the denomination:

Number of 20 dollar bills = Total amount / Denomination
= $1000 / $20
= 50

Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills left after losing some is:

Number of 20 dollar bills left = Total number of 20 dollar bills - Lost bills
= 50 - 10
= 40

Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay a bill. So, the number of 20 dollar bills used is:

Number of 20 dollar bills used = Half of remaining bills
= 40 / 2
= 20

This leaves Thomas with:

Number of 20 dollar bills left = Remaining bills - Used bills
= 40 - 20
= 20

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, tripling his money means he now has:

Number of 20 dollar bills = Total amount * 3 / Denomination
= ($1000 * 3) / $20
= $3000 / $20
= 150

Thomas then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he now has 150 20 dollar bills, the total amount he has is:

Total amount = Number of 20 dollar bills * Denomination
= 150 * $20
= $3000

To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide the total amount by the denomination:

Number of 5 dollar bills = Total amount / Denomination
= $3000 / $5
= 600

So, Thomas has \boxed{600} 5 dollar bills.</s>","He withdrew 1000/20=<<1000/20=50>>50 bills

5. To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we add the goals scored by each team in each half: (4 + 0.5) + (2 + 8) = 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

                    question:
                    A teacher uses a 5-inch , piece of chalk to write math , equations ; on a chalkboard for his students.

If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has ; to recycle this piece?
                [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total length of chalk used on Monday.
The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday. So, the total length of chalk used on Monday is 45% of 5 inches.
Chalk used on Monday = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Step 2: Determine the length of chalk left after Monday.
The teacher started with a new piece of 5-inch chalk. After using 2.25 inches on Monday, the length of chalk left is:
Chalk left = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Step 3: Calculate how many days the teacher can use the chalk at the rate of 20% per day.
The teacher wants to use only 20% of the chalk each day. So, we need to find out how many days he can use the chalk at this rate.
Number of days = Chalk left / (20% of 5-inch chalk)
Number of days = 2.75 / (0.2 * 5)
Number of days = 2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days

Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk and recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, he will recycle the chalk after 2.75 days of using only 20% of the chalk per day.

\boxed{2.75} days before he has to recycle the chalk.</s>","The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
Since 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many girls and boys are on varsity. One-third of the girls are on varsity. Since there are 12 girls, one-third would be 12/3 = 4 girls on varsity.

2. Similarly, one-fourth of the boys are on varsity. Since there are 12 boys, one-fourth would be 12/4 = 3 boys on varsity.

3. Now, we add the number of boys and girls on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity. That's 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students on varsity.

4. Finally, to find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students. The total number of students is 12 boys + 12 girls = 24 students. So, 24 students - 7 students on varsity = 17 students not on varsity.

Therefore, {The final answer is} 17 students are not on varsity.</s>","There are 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 students in Miss Albert's class.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. James has 30 teeth initially.
2. The dentist drills 4 teeth. This means 4 teeth are prepared for capping.
3. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, he caps 4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 teeth.
4. In total, the dentist works on 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.
5. To find the percentage of teeth the dentist fixes, we calculate the proportion of fixed teeth to the total number of teeth and then multiply by 100%:
   (Fixed teeth / Total teeth) * 100% = (15 / 30) * 100% = 0.5 * 100% = 50%.

So, the dentist fixes {50%} of James' teeth.</s>","First find the total number of teeth the dentist caps: 4 teeth + 7 teeth = <<4+7=11>>11 teeth

Calculate . how much he got in refunds.
                [/INST] To calculate the refund amount, let's break down the steps as follows:

1. Initially, the company sold 4000 gallons of milk.
2. According to the problem, 2/5 of the milk passed the expiry date and could not be sold. So, we need to find out the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned:

      4000 gallons * (2/5) = 1600 gallons

3. Mr. Marcellus sold the milk at a cost of $3.5 per gallon. So, the initial cost of 4000 gallons of milk is:

      4000 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $14,000

4. The refund amount would be proportional to the amount of milk returned. So, to find the refund amount, we divide the initial cost by the total gallons and multiply it by the gallons returned:

      Refund Amount = ( (14,000 / 4000) ) * 1600

      Refund Amount = ($3.5/gallon) * 1600 gallons

      Refund Amount = $5,600

Hence, Mr. Marcellus was refunded $5,600.

The final answer is {The amount refunded is $5,600}.</s>","If he purchased 4000 gallons, the number of gallons expired is 2/5 * 4000 gallons = <<2/5*4000=1600>>1600 gallons.
If each gallon costs $3.5, and he returned 1600 gallons for refund, the total amount he got from the refund is $3.5/gallon * 1600 gallons = $<<3.5*1600=5600>>5600

                    question:
                    Wendy is five times as ; old as Colin will : be seven years ? from now. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. How old is Colin now?
                [/INST] Wendy's age is unknown and she is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years. At the moment, Wendy is five times Colin's age. That means Wendy's age in the future equals this five-times relation multiplied by seven.

In 25 years, Wendy will be 25 years older, so we add 25 to Wendy's current age. At the same time, Colin will be 25 years older, so we add 25 to Colin's current age but keep the five-times relation because that's a fundamental property that never changes. If Wendy's age in the future equals five times Colin's age in the future, then in the present Wendy's age equals five times Colin's age.

This translates to the equation:

5 * (W - 25) = C + 25

And we also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:

(C + 25) = (1/3)W

Solving this system of equations, we will get:

5W - 125 = C + 25
C = (1/3)W - 25

C = (1/3)W - 25
5W - 125 = C + 25
5W - 125 = (1/3)W - 25 + 25
5W - 125 = (1/3)W
5W - (1/3)W = 125
3.75W = 125
W = 33.33 (approximately)

So Wendy is approximately 33 years old. Using this information, we can calculate Colin's age:

C = (1/3)W - 25
C = (1/3)*33.33 - 25
C = 11.11 - 25
C = -13.89 (This appears incorrect, as age cannot be negative)

Based on our calculations, there seems to be an error in the problem. Since Wendy's age cannot be less than Colin's age when Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years, the problem might be improperly set up, or there might be additional information needed to solve it appropriately.

1. First, let's find out how much Bob can spend on buying books for all schools. He has $27000 and he can buy 100 books for $500. So, the cost of buying a single book is $500/100 = ${5 per book}.

2. Now, we need to find out how much he can spend on each school. He is distributing his budget among 3 schools. So, his budget for each school is $27000/3 = $9000.

3. Finally, we can find out how many books he can buy for each school. He can spend $9000 on each school and each book costs $5. So, the number of books he can buy for each school is $9000/$5 = 1800 books.

                [/INST] Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. First, we need to determine how many snowballs Jay loses every hour. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, that means they melt 4 times in an hour (60 minutes/15 minutes per melt = 4 melts per hour). So, Jay loses 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs every hour due to melting.

2. Next, we need to figure out how many net snowballs Jay can make in an hour. He makes 20 snowballs but loses 8 due to melting, so he can net 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs every hour.

3. Finally, we need to determine how long it will take for Jay to make 60 snowballs at this rate. If Jay can make 12 snowballs every hour, it will take him 60 / 12 = 5 hours to make 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: Jay will need 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.</s>","Every hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs.
At the same time, each hour 2 * 60/15 = <<2*60/15=8>>8 snowballs melt.

3. To find out Jim's age at that time, we need to know how many years ago the anniversary was. However, the information given does not specify this, so we cannot proceed further without additional information.

Without knowing how many years ago the anniversary was, we cannot determine Jim's current age based on the information provided. Therefore, the problem cannot be solved as it stands.

1. Doxa ate 1 slice.

2. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.

3. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they all ate:

Doxa's slices + Sister's slices + Brother's slices = Total slices eaten

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages remaining after the first day.

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day. So, they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

3. They started the second day with 12 bandages, so after using 28, they had 12 - 28 = -16 bandages. This means they didn't have enough bandages and had to order more.

4. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.

5. They used half a pack of bandages on the third day, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

6. They started the third day with -16 bandages, so after ordering and using bandages, they had 100 - 25 - 16 = 69 bandages.

7. They ended the third day with 78 bandages, so they must have started the third day with 78 - 69 = 9 bandages.

8. They started the first day with 12 bandages, so they must have started the first day with 12 + 9 = \boxed{21} bandages.

Final answer: The hospital started with 21 bandages on the first day.</s>","Let B be the number of bandages the nurses’ station started with.
On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 50, so they had B - 38 + 50 = B + 12 bandages left.
On the second day, they used 38 - 10 = <<38-10=28>>28 bandages.
Thus, at the end of the second day, they had B + 12 - 28 = B - 16 bandages left.
On the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used half a pack, so they used 50 / 2 = 25.
Thus, on the third day, they had B - 16 + 100 - 25 = B + 59 bandages left.

1. First, we need to determine the cost of the haircut. The hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, which means May lost 2 inches of hair.

2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. So, the cost for the haircut is 2 inches * $30/inch = $60.

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate Jen's weekly earnings from her hourly rate. She works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week, so:

   Weekly hours worked = Daily hours worked * Days worked per week
   = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week
   = 45 hours/week

2. Next, we multiply the weekly hours worked by her hourly rate to find her weekly earnings from her hourly rate:

   Weekly earnings from hourly rate = Weekly hours worked * Hourly rate
   = 45 hours/week * $1.5/hour
   = $67.5/week

3. Jen also receives an additional $10 for complete attendance, so we add this to her weekly earnings:

   Total weekly earnings = Weekly earnings from hourly rate + Additional earnings for attendance
   = $67.5/week + $10
   = $77.5/week

4. Finally, we need to multiply her total weekly earnings by the number of weeks in April to find her total earnings for the month:

   Total earnings for April = Total weekly earnings * Number of weeks in April
   = $77.5/week * 4 weeks
   = $310

So, Jen will receive \boxed{$310} in April.</s>","In a week, Jen works for 7.5 hours/day x 6 days = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours/week
So in a month, she works for 45 hours/week x 4 weeks = <<45*4=180>>180 hours.
180 hours of work is equal to 180 hours x $1.5 = $<<180*1.5=270>>270.
Since she has complete attendance, she will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280.

                [/INST] To calculate the total amount of money Jason earned in a two-week period, we need to multiply the amount he earns for each task by the number of times he performed that task, and then sum up all the earnings.

1. For doing his laundry, he earns $3.00 once a week. So, in two weeks, he would earn:
   $3.00 * 1 (laundry session per week) * 2 (weeks) = $6.00

2. For cleaning his room, he earns $1.50 once a week. So, in two weeks, he would earn:
   $1.50 * 1 (room cleaning session per week) * 2 (weeks) = $3.00

3. For taking the trash to the curb, he earns $0.75 once a week. So, in two weeks, he would earn:
   $0.75 * 2 (trash sessions per week) * 2 (weeks) = $3.00

4. For emptying the dishwasher, he earns $0.50 each time. He did this 6 times in two weeks. So, he would earn:
   $0.50 * 6 (dishwasher emptying sessions) = $3.00

Now, let's sum up all the earnings:

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. We know that each pack contains 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
   5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 pens

2. The problem also states that the mom bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. So, the total number of black pens is:
   2 * 25 pens = 50 pens

3. To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to add the number of red pens and black pens together:

                [/INST] First, we need to find the unit price of scotch. Since John buys 10 bottles for $600, the unit price is $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Next, we need to find the unit price of cognac. Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, let's denote the number of bottles as x. So, he buys 10x bottles of cognac. Since the price of cognac is 50% more per bottle, the price is $60 * 1.5 = $90 per bottle.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of cognac. He spends $90 * x = $90 * (10 / 2) = $450 on cognac because he buys twice as many bottles.

Finally, we add the total cost of scotch and cognac to find the total amount spent. So, he spends $600 + $450 = $1050 on everything.

1. **First Day Trees Planted:**
   - White Oak trees: 20
   - Lodgepole Pine trees: Since it's twice as many as White Oak, we calculate this as $20 \times 2 = 40$.

2. **Second Day Trees Planted:**
   - White Oak trees: $20 + 10 = 30$ (adding 10 more to the initial 20).
   - Lodgepole Pine trees: To find out how many more Lodgepole Pine trees were planted on the second day, we first find $1/4$ of what was planted on the first day, which is $40 \div 4 = 10$. Then, we add this to the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day to get the total for the second day: $40 + 10 = 50$.

3. **Total Trees Planted in Two Days:**
   - Total White Oak trees: $20 + 30 = 50$.
   - Total Lodgepole Pine trees: $40 + 50 = 90$.

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is the sum of the total White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees, which is $50 + 90 = 140$.

                    Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40. How ? many coffee mugs are in the teacher’s ! lounge?
                [/INST] Let's think through this step by step:

1. The phrase, ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge"" can be translated into algebra as: 8 + 4*m
2. We are given that this equals 40, so we can set up the equation: 8 + 4*m = 40
3. To solve for m, we'll first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 4*m = 32
4. Then, we'll divide both sides by 4: m = 32 / 4
5. So, m = 8

Therefore, {The number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8}.</s>","Let m be the number of mugs
8+4*m=40

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We start with 66 fish in the tank.

2. One-third of these fish have red stripes. So, the number of fish with red stripes is (1/3) * 66 = 22 fish.

3. The remaining fish are 66 - 22 = 44 fish.

4. Now, we consider the fish without red stripes. 5/11 of these have blue stripes. 

5. So, the number of fish with blue stripes is (5/11) * 44 = 20 fish.

So, there are 22 fish with red stripes and 20 fish with blue stripes. {The final answer is: 22 fish with red stripes and 20 fish with blue stripes.}</s>","One-third of the fish in the fish tank have red stripes, a total of 1/3*66 = <<1/3*66=22>>22 fish

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. Amy initially has two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each. So, she has 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.
2. Amy also has three makeup sets, each containing six eyeshadow colors. So, she has 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.
3. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which means Amy loses four colors from the palettes. So, she now has 8 - 4 = 4 colors from the palettes.
4. Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set contains six colors, she uses up 6 / 2 = 3 colors from a set.
5. After using some colors, Amy now has 4 (from the palettes) + (18 - 6 / 2) (from the remaining colors in the makeup sets) = 4 + 15 = 19 colors left.

So, {Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left.}</s>","Amy had 2 * 4 + 3 * 6 = 8 + 18 = <<2*4+3*6=26>>26 eyeshadow colors to start.
Her sister stole one palette of 4 colors, leaving Amy with 26 - 4 = <<26-4=22>>22 colors.
Half the colors from one makeup set are 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 colors.
Thus, Amy has 22 - 3 = <<22-3=19>>19 eyeshadow colors left.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. Mattison is 60 inches tall.
2. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. So, the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
3. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice Mattison's height. So, the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
4. The total height of the house is the sum of the height of the first floor, the roof from the first floor to the second floor, and the second floor. We know the total height of the house and the height of the first floor, so we can find the height of the roof from the first floor to the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height. That is, 420 - 180 = 240 inches.
5. However, the question asks for the height of the roof from the second floor's floor to the ceiling, which is the same as the height of the roof from the first floor to the second floor.

Step 1: Add up the miles for the first three dogs:
1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

Step 2: Subtract the total miles for the first three dogs from the average total miles for all dogs:
3 miles/day * 4 dogs = 12 miles/day
12 miles/day (total for all dogs) - 8 miles (total for first three dogs) = 4 miles

Step 3: Since the fourth dog walks at the same rate as the second dog (4 miles), the fourth dog also needs to walk 4 miles a day. However, the question asks for the average miles per day needed by the last dog, not the total miles. So we divide this amount by the number of dogs to find the average:

1. First, we need to find out how much money John gets as a loan from mortgaging his house. This is 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000.
   Loan amount = House value * Loan percentage
   = $250,000 * 0.4
   = $100,000

2. Next, we need to find out how much money John uses to pay off his debts. This is 60% of the loan amount we calculated in the previous step.
   Money used to pay debts = Loan amount * Debts percentage
   = $100,000 * 0.6
   = $60,000

3. Finally, to find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts, we subtract the amount he used to pay his debts from the total loan amount.
   Leftover money = Loan amount - Money used to pay debts

First, let's add the weights of the three tunas:
56 kg (first tuna) + 46 kg (second tuna) + 26 kg (last tuna) = 128 kg (total weight)

Next, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:

                    Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister , and promised to return it with an additional 2% , of the money he owed. For 11 months Stephen will give his sister $25 per month and the remaining amount, including the ! interest, will be paid on the twelfth month. How much will ! Stephen pay in the twelfth ? month?
                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen is going to pay back to his sister, including the initial $300 and the 2% interest.

The interest can be calculated as follows:
Interest = Principal * Interest Rate
Interest = $300 * 0.02
Interest = $6

So, the total amount including interest is $300 + $6 = $306.

Next, let's calculate how much money Stephen will have paid after 11 months if he pays $25 per month.

Total payment after 11 months = Payment per month * Number of months
Total payment after 11 months = $25 * 11
Total payment after 11 months = $275

Since Stephen has paid $275 in 11 months, we can calculate how much he will pay in the twelfth month.

Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Total amount including interest - Total payment after 11 months
Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = $306 - $275
Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = $31

So, Stephen will pay \boxed{31} in the twelfth month.</s>","Stephen will pay an additional $300 x 2/100 = $<<300*2/100=6>>6.
He should return a total of $300 + $6 = $<<300+6=306>>306.
For eleven months Stephen will pay a total of $25 x 11 = $<<25*11=275>>275.
Therefore, Stephen will pay 306 - 275 = $<<306-275=31>>31 on the twelfth month.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. The problem states that each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, so for two children, that would be:

Total diaper changes = Diaper changes per child * Number of children
                                 = 5 * 2
                                 = 10

Next, we need to find out how many diapers are changed by Jordan's wife. According to the problem, she changes half of the diapers, so:

Diapers changed by wife = Total diaper changes / 2
                                      = 10 / 2
                                      = 5

Finally, since Jordan changes the remaining diapers, we subtract the number of diapers changed by his wife from the total number of diaper changes:

Diapers changed by Jordan = Total diaper changes - Diapers changed by wife
                                        = 10 - 5
                                        = 5

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.</s>","Jordan has 2 children, each requiring 5 diaper changes per day, for a total of 5*2=<<2*5=10>>10 diaper changes per day.

The . true number of red ? jelly beans in the container is 900.  . How far off was his guess?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base (6 inches by 6 inches) and is 15 inches tall, so its volume is:
   Volume = base area * height = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

2. Next, we need to adjust this volume for the packing efficiency. If they get about 80% efficiency in packing, the actual volume available for the jelly beans is:
   Adjusted volume = 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

3. We also know that a jelly bean is approximately 0.15 cubic inches, so the total number of jelly beans in the jar is:
   Total jelly beans = Adjusted volume / jelly bean volume = 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

4. Now, we can calculate how many jelly beans are red, given that 30% of them are red:
   Red jelly beans = Total jelly beans * Percentage red = 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

5. The question states that the true number of red jelly beans is 900, so Tim's guess was off by:
   Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Guessed number of red jelly beans = 900 - 864 = 36.

6. To find out how far off this is in percentage terms, we can divide the difference by the true number and multiply by 100:
   Percentage error = (Difference / True number of red jelly beans) * 100 = (36 / 900) * 100 = 4%.

So, Tim's guess was off by 4% of the actual number of red jelly beans.

Therefore, \boxed{4\%} is the final answer.</s>","The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches
That means it can fit 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans
With 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there
So that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red
So his guess is off by 900-864=<<900-864=36>>36

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of people on the bus after the first stop.
The initial number of people is 20. After the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus now is:
20 (initial number) + 40 (number who entered at the first stop) = 60

Step 2: Determine the number of people who entered at the second station.
3/4 of the people who entered the bus at the first station entered at the second station. So, the number of people who entered at the second station is:
(3/4) * (40) = 30

Step 3: Determine the number of people on the bus after the second station.
Now, the number of people on the bus is:
60 (number after the first stop) + 30 (number who entered at the second station) = 90

Step 4: Determine the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus at the third station.
If the number of passengers doubled at the third station, the total number of passengers on the bus would be:
90 (current number of passengers) * 2 (doubling) = 180

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. So, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
200 (total capacity) - 180 (current number of passengers) = 20

Therefore, {The final answer is \boxed{20} people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.}</s>","If the number of passengers increased by 3/4 times the number that entered the bus on the first station, 3/4 * 40 people = <<3/4*40=30>>30 people entered the bus on the second station.
After the second station, the number of people on the bus was 20 people initially on the bus + 40 who entered at the first station + 30 who entered at the second station= <<20+40+30=90>>90 people.
The number of people doubled at the third station, which is 90 people * 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 people.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline . decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years. How much . did Pauline spend on all visits to the museum?
                [/INST] To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we calculate the cost of one visit per year initially:
- Initial cost of one visit = $2

Given that Pauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year, the total annual cost in the first five years is:
- Annual cost for 3 visits = $2 \times 3 = $6

Over five years, the total initial cost for 3 visits per year is:
- Total initial cost for 5 years = $6 \times 5 = $30

The cost of one visit increases by 150% after 5 years, so we calculate the new cost per visit:
- New cost per visit = $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + ($2 \times 1.5) = $2 + $3 = $5

For the next three years, Pauline continues to visit the museum three times a year at the new cost per visit, so the total cost for these three years is:
- Total cost for 3 visits per year for 3 years = $5 \times 3 \times 3 = $45

Adding the total initial cost for the first five years to the total cost for the last three years gives us the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum:
- Total amount spent = Total initial cost for 5 years + Total cost for 3 visits per year for 3 years = $30 + $45 = $75

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $\boxed{75}$ dollars.</s>","Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.
That means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.
After 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.
That means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.
So for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
During the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
In total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.

1. First, we need to determine the total number of students who will be trying the escape room. Since there are 4 grades with 10 students each, we multiply 4 grades by 10 students per grade, which equals 40 students.

2. Next, we need to figure out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from the 40 students to try the escape room. To do this, we divide 40 students by 8 students per group, which equals 5 groups.

3. Now, we know that each group takes 45 minutes to try and escape the room. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the 45 minutes by 60 minutes per hour to get 0.75 hours per group.

4. To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we multiply the number of groups (5) by the time it takes for each group (0.75 hours). This equals 3.75 hours.

                [/INST] Solution:
1. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet.
2. According to the problem, the longer piece is \( 4 \) times longer than the shorter piece, which means the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.
3. Since the total length of the board is \( 40 \) feet and the two pieces together must equal this total length, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 4x = 40
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation gives us:
   \[
   5x = 40
   \]
5. Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by \( 5 \):
   \[
   x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]
6. Now, to find the length of the longer piece, we calculate \( 4 \) times the length of the shorter piece:
   \[
   4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ feet}
   \]
7. Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \( \boxed{32 \text{ feet}} \).

So, the final answer is that the longer piece is \( \boxed{32} \) feet long.</s>","Let x be the length of the shorter piece.
The two pieces are 4x and x in length.
The equation is 4x + x = 40 when the lengths of the two boards are added.
Adding like terms makes the equation 5x = 40.
Then dividing 40 by 5 gives the value of x which is <<40/5=8>>8.
Since x =8, the longer piece is 4*8 = 32.

   Meat needed = Total meatballs / Meatballs per pound
   = 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs/pound
   = 5 pounds

2. Next, we need to find out how much of his secret seasoning he needs for 5 pounds of ground beef. Since he adds two tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we multiply the number of pounds by the amount of seasoning needed per pound:
   Seasoning needed = Meat needed * Seasoning per pound

Cost_1 = $4

Step 2: Determine the cost of the remaining minutes
After 16 minutes, the rate changes to $0.2 per minute. The remaining minutes are:
Remaining_Minutes = Total_Minutes - Minutes_1
Remaining_Minutes = 36 - 16
Remaining_Minutes = 20

So, the cost for the remaining minutes is:
Cost_2 = Remaining_Minutes * Rate_2
Cost_2 = 20 * $0.2
Cost_2 = $4

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the call
The total cost of the call is the sum of the costs for the two segments:
Total_Cost = Cost_1 + Cost_2
Total_Cost = $4 + $4

                    Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies ? as cupcakes. If Carly's class has five ; people and each person gets two treats, , how many , cupcakes did Carly make?
                [/INST] Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as C and the number of brownies as B.

From the problem, we know that:
1. B = 3C - 2 (Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes)
2. Total treats = Treats per person * Number of people = 2 * 5 = 10

Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, Carly needs to make a total of 10 treats.

So, we can write another equation as:
3. C + B = 10 (total treats made)

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation to solve for C (the number of cupcakes):

C + (3C - 2) = 10
4C - 2 = 10
4C = 12
C = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

\boxed{3}</s>","First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats
Next, express the number of brownies in terms of the number of cupcakes based on the problem information: b = 3c - 2, where b is the number of brownies and c is the number of cupcakes
We know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10
Now we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10
We add two to both sides of the equation to get 4c = 12
Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to get c = 3

                [/INST] To calculate the total cost for Karen's manicure, pedicure, and nail art, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount:
   Cost of manicure = $35
   Cost of pedicure = $40
   Total cost without discount = $35 + $40 = $75

2. Calculate the discount for both services:
   Discount = 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15

3. Calculate the total cost with the discount:
   Total cost with discount = $75 - $15 = $60

4. Calculate the cost of nail art for all her fingers:
   Number of nails = 10 (one on each finger)
   Cost of nail art = $3 per nail * 10 nails = $30

5. Calculate the total cost with the nail art:
   Total cost with nail art = $60 + $30 = $90

Therefore, the total cost for Karen's manicure, pedicure, and nail art would be $\boxed{\$90}$ .</s>","The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we will calculate the number of issues Susan receives from each magazine and then sum them up to find the total number of issues she gets every year.

1. **First Magazine Issues Calculation**:
   - Susan subscribes to 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year.
   - Therefore, the total issues from these magazines is calculated as follows:
     \[
     3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues}
     \]

2. **Second Magazine Issues Calculation**:
   - Her second magazine sends 6 issues a year.
   - Since she subscribes to only one of these magazines, the total issues from this magazine is simply:
     \[
     1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues}
     \]

3. **Comparative Issues Calculation for the Third Magazine**:
   - The last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine.
   - The issues from this magazine are calculated as:
     \[
     4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues}
     \]

4. **Total Issues Calculation**:
   - To find the total number of issues Susan gets every year, we add the issues from all three magazines:
     \[
     36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues}
     \]

   Increase = $40 * 80/100 = $32
   New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

3. In January, the price decreased by 50%. So, to find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the original price in December.
   Decrease = $72 * 50/100 = $36
   New price in January = $72 - $36

So, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is {The final answer is $\boxed{36}}$.</s>","In November, the toy's price was $<<40=40>>40.

Distance covered in one day = Average speed * Time taken
Since there are 24 hours in a day:
Distance covered in one day = 50 km/hr * 24 hr = 1200 km

Next, let's calculate how many days it would take Michael to cover the entire distance of 6000 km:

Number of days = Total distance / Distance covered in one day
Number of days = 6000 km / 1200 km/day = 5 days

Since Michael travels for 3 days, we can now calculate the percentage of the total distance he has covered:

Percentage covered = (Distance covered in 3 days / Total distance) * 100%
Percentage covered = (1200 km/day * 3 days / 6000 km) * 100%
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100%
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100%
Percentage covered = 60%

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to find out how many teachers were absent or sick, and then subtract that number from the total number of teachers to find out how many were actually at the school that day.

Step 1: Find out how many teachers were absent.
The problem states that 13 of the 82 teachers were sick, so 13 teachers were absent.

Step 2: Find out how many substitute teachers were called in.
The problem states that 9 substitute teachers were called in to help.

Step 3: Find out whether the substitute teachers are included in the total number of teachers.
Unfortunately, the problem doesn't clarify whether these substitute teachers are already included in the total number of teachers or not. If we assume that they are, then the number of substitute teachers who were at the school would be 9 (since they were called in to help). But if they are not included in the total number of teachers, then there are actually 9 more teachers at the school who day.

Step 4: Calculate the number of teachers at the school that day.
If the substitute teachers are included in the total number of teachers, then the number of teachers at the school that day would be 82 - 13 (sick teachers) + 9 (substitute teachers) = 78 teachers.

If the substitute teachers are not included in the total number of teachers, then the number of teachers at the school that day would be 82 - 13 (sick teachers) + 9 (substitute teachers) = 78 + 9 = 87 teachers.

                [/INST] Bud spends $1.00 on pasta for each macaroni and cheese meal. He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese, and twice that amount for the gruyere cheese. So, the cost for cheese is $3.00 + 2*$3.00 = $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.

The total cost per meal is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes this meal once a week, he spends $10.00 per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so in one year, Bud spends $10.00 per week * 52 weeks = $520.00.

{The final answer is $520.00.}</s>","The gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the $3.00 cheddar cheese so it costs 2*3 = $<<2*3=6.00>>6.00

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total time needed to clean all the classrooms.

The total time is equal to the number of classrooms times the time taken per classroom.
Total time = Number of classrooms * Time per classroom
= 80 * 15 minutes
= 1200 minutes

Next, let's convert the total time into hours, since the working day is given in hours.
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
Total time = 1200 / 60 = 20 hours

Now, let's calculate the number of working hours available.
The custodian works 8 hours a day for 5 days, so:
Total working hours = 8 * 5 = 40 hours

The percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms is the total time needed for cleaning divided by the total working hours, multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.
Percentage of day = (Total time / Total working hours) * 100
= (20 / 40) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

Therefore, {The final answer is \boxed{50\%}} of their day is spent cleaning classrooms.</s>","They have to clean 16 classrooms a day because 80 / 5 = <<80/5=16>>16
They spend 240 minutes cleaning per day because 16 x 15 = <<16*15=240>>240
They spend 4 hours a day because 240 / 60 = <<240/60=4>>4
They spend half their day cleaning classrooms because 4 / 8 = <<4/8=.5>>.5

If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold : all of ? them?
                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which means it can hold 20 books (10 * 2).
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, which means it can hold 15 books (20 - 5).

So, each bookcase can hold a total of 10 (middle shelf) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 45 books.

Now, Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold:

110 books / 45 books per bookcase = approximately 2.44 bookcases.

Since Elly can't have a fraction of a bookcase, she'll need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

{The final answer is 3 bookcases.}</s>","The bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.
The 2 middle shelves can hold a total of 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.

Each bookcase can hold a total of 20 books + 20 books + 15 books = <<20+20+15=55>>55 books.

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen cost $2.40. So, the total cost is 5*$2.40 = $\boxed{12.00}.

Next, let's find out how many eggs Rose can sell at $1 for 3 eggs. We can find this by multiplying the cost by 3, which is 1*(3) = $\boxed{3.00}.

But we need to know how many dozens of eggs this is equivalent to. Since each dozen contains 12 eggs, we can find this by dividing the number of eggs by 12. So, 3.00/12 = $\boxed{0.25}. This means Rose can sell 0.25 dozens of eggs at $1 for 3 eggs.

Since Rose bought 5 dozens, the total number of dozens she can sell at this price is 5 - 0.25 = $\boxed{4.75}.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. We multiply the number of dozens she can sell by the price per dozen, which is 4.75*(1.00) = $\boxed{4.75}.

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost of the eggs from the total revenue, which is 4.75 - 12.00 = $\boxed{(-7.25)}. This means Rose will incur a loss of $7.25, not a profit.

{The final answer is: Rose will incur a loss of $7.25.}</s>","Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.
Five dozens of eggs is equal to 12 x 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 eggs.
So there are 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 sets of 3 eggs that Rose will sell.
Thus, the total earnings of Rose for selling the eggs are $1 x 20 = $<<20=20>>20.
Therefore, her profit will be $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8.

                [/INST] First, let's determine the number of hats in each color based on the given fractions.

Number of red hats = Total hats * Fraction of red hats
= 100 hats * 1/2
= 50 hats

The number of hats that are not red is equal to the total number of hats minus the number of red hats.

Number of non-red hats = Total hats - Number of red hats
= 100 hats - 50 hats
= 50 hats

Now, we can determine the number of blue hats using the given fraction:

Number of blue hats = Number of non-red hats * Fraction of blue hats
= 50 hats * 3/5
= 30 hats

Since the remaining hats are white, we can subtract the number of blue hats from the number of non-red hats to find the number of white hats.

Number of white hats = Number of non-red hats - Number of blue hats
= 50 hats - 30 hats
= 20 hats

{The final answer is 20 white hats.}</s>","If half of the hats are red, there are 1/2*100= <<1/2*100=50>>50 red hats.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, a total of 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30 hats
If the rest of the remaining hats are white, then there are 50-30 = <<50-30=20>>20 white hats.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total cost of one bag with the discount**: Archie has $3.00 off a bag that originally costs $18.00. So, the total cost after the discount is:
   \[18.00 - 3.00 = \$15.00\]

2. **Determine the cost per stick**: Since the bag contains 30 sticks and now costs $15.00, the cost per stick is:
   \[\frac{15.00}{30} = \$0.50\]

3. **Convert the cost per stick to cents**: Since $1.00 is equal to 100 cents, the cost per stick in cents is:
   \[0.50 \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents}\]

Therefore, the final answer, encapsulated as requested, is:

1. Jason needs to sell 15 cars to earn his big bonus.
2. For every 25 telephone calls, he gets one person to come into the dealership.
3. For every two customers that come into the dealership, one will buy a car.

First, we need to figure out how many people will come into the dealership based on the number of telephone calls Jason makes. Since for every 25 calls, one person comes in, we can calculate the number of people coming in by multiplying the number of calls by 1/25.

We don't know the exact number of calls yet, so let's call it 'x'. So, the number of people coming in is x/25.

Next, we know that for every two customers who come in, one will buy a car. So, the number of cars sold will be half the number of people coming in, which is (x/25)/2.

We want to sell 15 cars, so we can set up the equation: (x/25)/2 = 15.

Solving this equation gives us: x/50 = 15, and then x = 750.

So, Jason would need to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

                [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of chips
Mitchell bought two bags of chips, each containing 55 chips. So, the total number of chips is:
Total chips = Chips per bag * Number of bags
Total chips = 55 chips/bag * 2 bags
Total chips = 110 chips

Step 2: Divide the total number of chips among the family members
Mitchell's family has five members, and he wants to distribute the chips equally among them. So, the number of chips each person gets is:
Chips per person = Total chips / Number of family members
Chips per person = 110 chips / 5 people
Chips per person = 22 chips

4. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so they each take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the times for all six sides:

5 minutes (first side) + 10 minutes (second side) + 10 minutes (third side) + 2.5 minutes (fourth side) + 2.5 minutes (fifth side) = 30 minutes

1. We know that Dominick saw 20 helmets.
2. The problem states that there were half as many robots as helmets. So, the number of robots would be half the number of helmets. That means 20 helmets * 1/2 = 10 robots.
3. The problem also states that there were half as many helmets as footballs. So, the number of footballs would be twice the number of helmets. That means 20 helmets * 2 = 40 footballs.
4. To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the number of helmets, robots, and footballs together. That means 20 helmets + 10 robots + 40 footballs = 70 items.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of calls Tim deals with in a day:**
   - We know Tim spends 6 hours at work each day.
   - There are 24 hours in a day. So, the time Tim spends not dealing with calls is $24 - 6 = 18$ hours.
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time in minutes is $18 \times 60 = 1080$ minutes.
   - Tim takes 15 minutes to deal with each call. To find out how many calls he deals with in a day, we divide the total time he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with one call: $\frac{1080}{15} = 72$ calls.

2. **Calculate the number of calls Tim deals with in a week:**
   - There are 5 working days in a week.
   - To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by the number of working days in a week: $72 \times 5 = 360$ calls.

Therefore, Tim deals with $\boxed{360}$ calls during his 5-day work week.</s>","He spends 6*60=<<6*60=360>>360 minutes dealing with calls

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to determine the number of plants that need a quarter cup of water. Crista has 20 plants in total, and 4 plants need half a cup of water, and 8 plants need 1 cup of water. So, the number of plants needing a quarter cup of water would be 20 (total plants) - 4 (plants needing half a cup) - 8 (plants needing 1 cup) = 8 plants.

2. Next, we calculate the total amount of water needed for each type of plant:
   - For the 4 plants needing half a cup of water, Crista needs 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water.
   - For the 8 plants needing 1 cup of water, Crista needs 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water.
   - For the 8 plants needing a quarter cup of water, Crista needs 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water.

3. Finally, we add up the total amount of water Crista needs for all her plants every day: 2 (for half a cup) + 8 (for 1 cup) + 2 (for a quarter cup) = 12 cups of water.

The final answer is that Crista needs \boxed{12} cups of water every day for her plants.</s>","She will need 2 cups for the plants that need half of a cup of water because .5*4 = 2 cups

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. Since he makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and one dozen is equal to 12, he makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

2. Next, we need to calculate the total revenue Derrick makes each day by selling all the doughnuts. Since he sells each doughnut for $2, the total revenue per day is 120 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $240.

3. Now, we need to calculate the total revenue for the entire month of June. Assuming June has 30 days (which is actually correct), the total revenue for June is $240/day * 30 days = $7200.

4. Finally, the question asks for Derrick's earnings, but earnings typically refer to the amount of money a person receives after taxes and other deductions. If Derrick keeps all of his revenue, then his earnings in June would also be $7200.

3. Now, to find out how much Alicia spends on dry cleaning in 5 weeks, we simply multiply this weekly cost by 5: $47.00 * 5 = $235.00

So, the final answer is {Alicia spends $235.00 on dry cleaning in 5 weeks}.</s>","The blouses cost $5.00 each to dry clean and she has 5 so that's 5*5 = $<<5*5=25.00>>25.00

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first day, there were 50 people at the beach.
2. On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day. So, on the second day, there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.
3. On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day. So, on the third day, there were 70 * 2 = 140 people.
4. Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week. There are 7 days in a week, and we've already accounted for 3 days. So, there are 7 - 3 = 4 days left in the week.
5. Therefore, for the rest of the week, Conor saw a total of 60 people/day * 4 days = 240 people.
6. To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people he saw on the first, second, and third days to the number of people he saw for the rest of the week. So, the total is 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400 people.

The final answer is {400 people}.</s>","There were 50 people at the beach on the first day. On the second day, the number of people at the beach increased to 50 people + 20 people = <<50+20=70>>70 people
The third day, the total number of people at the beach was twice the number on the second day: thus, 2 * 70 people = <<70*2=140>>140 people
For the remaining days of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people per day, for a total of 60 people/day * 4 days = <<60*4=240>>240 people
Conor saw a total of 240 people + 140 people + 70 people + 50 people = <<240+140+70+50=500>>500 people

                    Garrett is popping popcorn for a . snack. ? As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster.

How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?
                [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Popping Rate**: In the first 30 seconds, Garrett hears 20 kernels pop.

2. **Increased Popping Rate**: After 30 seconds, the popping rate triples. So, the number of kernels that pop in the next 30 seconds is:
   \[
   20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ kernels}
   \]

3. **Further Increase**: In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases four times the initial rate. Therefore, the number of kernels that pop in this period is:
   \[
   20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ kernels}
   \]

4. **Decreased Popping Rate**: In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the rate from the previous 30 seconds. Thus, the number of kernels that pop is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ kernels}
   \]

5. **Residual Heat Popping**: After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds continue to pop. This is:
   \[
   40 \times \frac{1}{4} = 10 \text{ kernels}
   \]

6. **Total Popped Kernels**: To find the total number of kernels that have popped, we add all these amounts together:
   \[
   20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \text{ kernels}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of kernels (pieces of popcorn) Garrett has to eat is $\boxed{210}$.</s>","In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 kernels pop.
In the third 30 seconds, 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 kernels pop.
In the final 30 seconds, 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 40 / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 kernels pop.
Thus, Garrett has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = <<20+60+80+40+10=210>>210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

Step 2: His recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice for a gallon of lemonade.

Step 3: 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. So, for 4 gallons of lemonade, Tim would need 4 cups of lemon juice.

Step 4: Since 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice, 4 gallons would require 4 cups of lemon juice.

Step 5: Allen asked for an extra gallon of lemonade, which is twice as tart. This means it would require 2 cups of lemon juice.

Step 6: Therefore, for Allen's lemonade, Tim would need another 2 cups of lemon juice.

Step 7: In total, Tim would need 4 cups (for the party) + 2 cups (for Allen's gallon) = 6 cups of lemon juice.

Step 8: Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, for 6 cups of lemon juice, Tim would need 6 * 6 = 36 lemons.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. First, we calculate the daily food consumption for all the German Shepherds and Bulldogs combined.
   - German Shepherds consume 5 kg each per day. There are 3 of them, so they consume 3 * 5 = 15 kg per day.
   - Bulldogs consume 3 kg each per day. There are 2 of them, so they consume 2 * 3 = 6 kg per day.

2. Next, we add the daily consumption of both types of dogs to get the total daily consumption.
   - Total daily consumption = 15 kg (German Shepherds) + 6 kg (Bulldogs) = 21 kg.

3. Finally, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption.
   - Weekly consumption = 21 kg per day * 7 days = 147 kg.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need {147} kilograms of dog food in a week.</s>","The German Shepherds consume 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 kilograms of dog food per day.
The Bulldogs consume 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 kilograms of dog food per day.
The dogs can consume a total of 15 + 6 = <<15+6=21>>21 kilograms of dog food per day.
Therefore, they need 21 x 7 = <<21*7=147>>147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. First, we calculate the total number of legs for the 2-legged animals. Since there are 10 of these, and each has 2 legs, the total number of 2-legged legs is 2 * 10 = 20 legs.

2. Next, we calculate the total number of legs for the 4-legged animals. There are 15 of these, and each has 4 legs, so the total number of 4-legged legs is 4 * 15 = 60 legs.

3. To find the total number of leg pairs, we add the number of 2-legged legs and the number of 4-legged legs together, then divide by 2 (since each pair of legs is part of one animal). This gives us (20 + 60) / 2 = 80 legs.

So, the total number of leg pairs on the farm is 80.</s>","2-legged animals have 2 legs. Therefore 10 2-legged animals will have 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 legs

                [/INST] To find out how far Elvis is from his house after driving west and then east, we need to calculate the distance covered by each part of his journey.

1. For the west part of the journey:
   The distance covered is equal to the speed multiplied by the time. However, in this case, we don't know the speed during the west part of the journey, but we do know the total time (5 hours) and speed (18mph).

2. For the east part of the journey:
   Similarly, we don't know the exact time he took to travel eastward, but we do know he returned after traveling for some hours and the total distance was covered at an average speed of 18mph.

Since both parts of the journey involved the average speed of 18mph and Elvis returned home, it means he has covered the total distance twice (5 hours west + 8 hours east = 13 hours total travel).

To get the total distance covered:
   Total distance = Speed * Time
   Total distance = 18 mph * 13 hours
   Total distance = 234 miles

As Elvis has returned home, the final distance from his house is 0 miles {The final answer is: 0 miles}.</s>","During the first part of the journey he travels west for 5 hours at a speed of 18mph so he covered a distance of 5*18 = <<5*18=90>>90 miles
Then he travels east at the same speed for 8 hours so he covered a distance of 8*18 = <<8*18=144>>144 miles
His distance from his house now is the difference between his east and west movements which is 144-90 = <<144-90=54>>54 miles

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the value of the boat after the first year
The boat depreciated 30% in the first year. To find the new value, subtract 30% of the original price from the original price.
30% of $9000 = (30/100) * $9000 = $2700
So, the value of the boat after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Step 2: Calculate the value of the boat after the second year
The boat depreciated another 30% in the second year. Using the value from the first year, subtract 30% of it from the value after the first year.
30% of $6300 = (30/100) * $6300 = $1890
So, the value of the boat after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Step 3: Calculate the value of the boat after the third year
The boat depreciated 20% in the third year. Using the value from the second year, subtract 20% of it from the value after the second year.
20% of $4410 = (20/100) * $4410 = $882

                [/INST] First, let's denote the number of orange candies as O and the number of yellow candies as Y.

Given that there are 54 red candies (R), the number of orange candies (O) is twice that of red candies. So, O = 2 * R = 2 * 54 = 108.

The number of yellow candies (Y) is half as many as the red candies. So, Y = 0.5 * R = 0.5 * 54 = 27.

Now, let's denote the number of pink candies as P.

We know that the total number of candies in the bag is 232. So, the sum of red, orange, yellow, and pink candies should equal 232.

So, R + O + Y + P = 232

Substituting the values of R, O, and Y we get:

54 + 108 + 27 + P = 232

Now, let's solve for P:

P = 232 - 54 - 108 - 27
P = 232 - 233
P = -1

However, the number of candies cannot be negative. This indicates that there might be a mistake in the problem statement. If we assume that the total number of candies is 233 (not 232), then we get:

P = 233 - 54 - 108 - 27
P = 44

So, if the total number of candies is 233, then there are 44 pink candies.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{44} (assuming the total number of candies is 233).</s>","There are 54 red candies and twice that amount of orange candies for a total of 54*2 = <<54*2=108>>108 candies
The yellow candies are half the amount of the 54 red candies so there are 54/2 = <<54/2=27>>27 candies
All total there are 54 red candies, 108 orange candies and 27 yellow candies so 54+108+27 = <<54+108+27=189>>189 candies

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorns. There are two popcorns and each one costs $3:

Cost of popcorns = number of popcorns * cost of each popcorn
Cost of popcorns = 2 * $3
Cost of popcorns = $6

Finally, let's add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns to find the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of popcorns

                [/INST] First, let's calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and the two kids.

The weight of the car is 1200 pounds.
The weight of the luggage is 250 pounds.
The weight of the two kids is 75 pounds each, and there are two kids, so the total weight of the kids is 75 * 2 = 150 pounds.

So, the total weight is 1200 (car) + 250 (luggage) + 150 (kids) = 1600 pounds.

Next, we need to find out what 1% of 1600 pounds is, because that's the force needed to move the car.

1% of 1600 pounds is 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds.

So, he needs 16 pounds of force to push the car.

Therefore, the final answer is {The force needed to push the car is 16 pounds}.</s>","His two children weigh 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 pounds
So the total weight of the car and everything is 1200+250+150=<<1200+250+150=1600>>1600 pounds
So he needs to generate 1600*.01=<<1600*.01=16>>16 pounds

                [/INST] To figure out how many feet of crepe paper James needs, we need to first find the perimeter of his fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding together the lengths of all sides.

Let's first calculate the length of one side:

1. Long side: 20 feet
2. Short side: 15 feet

Now let's calculate the perimeter:
- Perimeter = 2 * (Long side + Short side)
- Perimeter = 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet)
- Perimeter = 2 * 35 feet
- Perimeter = 70 feet

As a result, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper for his backyard fence.

{The final answer is: 70 feet}</s>","First figure out how much crepe paper James needs for the long sides. Since there are two long sides, multiple the side's length by 2: 20 feet * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 feet
Now do the same multiplication to find out how much crepe paper James needs for the short sides: 15 feet * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 feet
Now add the amounts for the short and long sides together to find the total amount of crepe paper needed: 40 feet + 30 feet = <<40+30=70>>70 feet

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down:

1. We know that Mia is 40 years old and she is younger than Emma.
2. The problem states that Mia and Emma are 16 years apart in age. So, Emma's age would be Mia's age plus 16. That is, Emma's age = 40 + 16 = 56 years old.
3. To find the average age, we add their ages together and divide by the number of people, which is 2 in this case. So, the average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2 = (40 + 56) / 2.
4. Calculating this gives us 96 / 2 = 48.

So, the average age of Mia and Emma is 48 years old. {The final answer is 48}</s>","If Mia is 40 years old, Emma is 40+16 = <<40+16=56>>56 years old.

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of one place setting.
A place setting consists of one dinner plate, one bowl, and one salad plate. So, the cost of one place setting is:
Cost of one dinner plate = $6.00
Cost of one bowl = $5.00
Cost of one salad plate = $4.00
So, Cost of one place setting = $6.00 + $5.00 + $4.00 = $15.00

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 12 place settings.
Avery is having 12 people over for dinner, so she needs 12 place settings. Therefore, the total cost is:

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the daily feed requirement for one pig is 4 pounds * 2 = 8 pounds.
Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total daily feed requirement for all pigs is 5 pigs * 8 pounds/pig = 40 pounds/day.

Step 2: Calculate the weekly feed requirement for all pigs.
There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly feed requirement for all pigs is 40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds/week.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of feed left after a week.

He has 20 guests and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.

He already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, he doesn't need these. Therefore, he needs 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

A pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs. So, to find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total number of hot dogs he needs by the number of hot dogs in a pack. So, he needs 36 / 6 = 6 packs.

Each pack costs $2. So, to find out how much he needs to spend on hot dogs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost of each pack. So, he needs to spend 6 * $2 = $12 on hot dogs.

So, in total, Frances makes $40 (from cupcakes) + $40 (from cookies) = $80.

Next, let's calculate how much money Frances spends on buying the trays.
She buys five trays at $4 each, so she spends 5 * $4 = $20.

Finally, to find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract the amount she spends on trays from the amount she makes from selling cupcakes and cookies: $80 (money made) - $20 (cost of trays) = $60.

1. On the first street, there are 5 children chasing the truck.
2. On the second street, each child is joined by another child, so the number of children increases by 5 (since each of the original 5 children is joined by one new child).
3. On the third street, each child in the existing group is joined by 2 new children, so the number of children increases by twice the current number of children, which is 2 * 10 = 20 (since each of the 10 children adds 2 new children to the group).
4. After the original 5 children give up, the number of children decreases by 5.

The final count of children would be calculated as follows:
Initial number of children: 5
Increase on the second street: 5
Increase on the third street: 20
Decrease after the original children leave: -5

Final calculation: 5 (initial) + 5 (second street) + 20 (third street) - 5 (original leave) = 35 - 5 = {The final answer is 30}.</s>","On the second street, each child is joined by another child so the group doubles to 5 children * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 children.

6 large t-shirts * 6 square feet each = 36 square feet

Now, we add the areas of all the t-shirts together to get the total area of the quilt:

33 square feet (from small t-shirts) + 32 square feet (from medium t-shirts) + 36 square feet (from large t-shirts) = 101 square feet

1. First, we need to find out how tall Anne is. Since Albert is twice the size of Anne and Albert is 36"" tall, Anne is half of Albert's height.
   Anne's height = Albert's height / 2
   = 36"" / 2

2. Next, we know that Jackie is now 1 inch shorter than Anne. So, Jackie's current height is:
   Jackie's current height = Anne's height - 1""

   = 17""

3. Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer. So, to find out her height before summer, we subtract the 3 inches she grew from her current height:

1. First, we determine the total number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks. Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, the number of bars produced in two weeks would be:
\[5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70,000 \text{ bars}\]

2. Next, we calculate the total revenue the company will receive from selling these chocolate bars. Given that each bar is sold for $2, the total revenue is:

                [/INST] Solution:

1. First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Since there is a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake only pays full price for one T-shirt and gets the second one at 50% off.
   Cost of first T-shirt = $8 (full price)
   Cost of second T-shirt = $8 * 0.5 (50% off) = $4
   Total cost of T-shirts = $8 + $4 = $12

2. Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The shoes are 40% off, so Jake pays 60% of the original price.
   Cost of shoes = $40 * 0.6 (60% of the original price) = $24

3. Finally, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store.
   Total cost = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes = $12 + $24 = $36

So, the final answer is {Jake spends $36 at the store}.</s>","The cost of a T-shirt after 50% is taken off of the original price is $8 * 0.50 = $<<8*0.50=4>>4

The amount of money taken off from the original price of the shoes is $40 * 0.40 = $<<40*0.4=16>>16
The cost of the shoes after the sale is $40 - $16 = $<<40-16=24>>24

Money earned from chores = Allowance per week * Number of weeks
= $6 * 3

Next, we need to calculate how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones:

Cost of ice cream cones = Cost per cone * Number of cones
= $1.25 * (1 + 3)
= $1.25 * 4
= $5

Now, subtract the cost of ice cream cones from the money earned from chores to find out how much money Ryan has left:

Money left = Money earned from chores - Cost of ice cream cones
= $18 - $5
= $13

Finally, we need to calculate how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining money:

Number of movie tickets = Money left / Cost per ticket
= $13 / $6.50

   - Photo frame = $5
   Ellen's total = $100 + $5 = $105

2. Lani's purchases:
   - Sunglasses = $30
   - Two bathrobes = $100 each, so $100 * 2 = $200
   Lani's total = $30 + $200 = $230

Now, let's add up the totals for Ellen and Lani:

Total spent by both = Ellen's total + Lani's total = $105 + $230 = $335

How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?
                [/INST] Solution: To solve this problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of ingredients per jar**: 
   - The cost of passion fruit for one jar is $6 \times 2 = \$12$.
   - The cost of jackfruit for one jar is $8 \times 1.5 = \$12$.
   - The cost of honey for one jar is $10 \times 2 = \$20$.
   - Therefore, the total cost of ingredients for one jar is $\$12 + \$12 + \$20 = \$44$.

2. **Calculate the total cost for 10 jars**: 
   - Since the cost of ingredients for one jar is $\$44$, for 10 jars, it would be $44 \times 10 = \$440$.

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars**: 
   - If each jar is sold for $\$50$, then selling 10 jars would bring in $50 \times 10 = \$500$.

4. **Calculate the profit**: 
   - The profit from selling 10 jars is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $\$500 - \$440 = \$60$.

Therefore, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix is $\boxed{\$60}$.</s>","The cost of the passion fruit is 2*6=$<<2*6=12>>12
The jackfruit cost 1.5*8=$<<1.5*8=12>>12

2. Dimes: There are 95 dimes in the jar. Each dime is worth $0.10. So, the total value of the dimes is:
   Total value of dimes = Number of dimes * Value of each dime
   = 95 * $0.10
   = $9.50

3. Nickels: There are 120 nickels in the jar. Each nickel is worth $0.05. So, the total value of the nickels is:
   Total value of nickels = Number of nickels * Value of each nickel
   = 120 * $0.05

Now, let's sum up the total value of all the coins:

Total value = Total value of quarters + Total value of dimes + Total value of nickels + Total value of pennies

Next, let's calculate how much money Janet had left after spending this amount.

Money given by parents = $40
Money left = Money given by parents - Total spent

Step 2: For his early day snack, he ate 1 of each flavor. So, he ate 1 oatmeal cookie, 1 chocolate chip cookie, and 1 sugar cookie. This brings his total down to 8 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies.

Step 3: He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. This leaves him with 6 oatmeal cookies.

Step 4: He gave away 2 sugar cookies. This leaves him with 6 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 2 sugar cookies.

Step 5: He baked 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he baked 4 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies. This brings his total up to 10 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies (since the 4 sugar cookies he baked replaced the ones he had given away to his friends).

Step 6: Now, we add up all the cookies he has left. This gives us 10 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies. The total number of cookies he has now is 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies.

                [/INST] First, let's determine how many toys are in each half of Matthew's collection. He has 12 unique toy soldiers, so when divided into two halves, we have:

Number of toys per half = Total number of toys / 2
= 12 / 2
= 6

Next, we need to calculate how much money Matthew would make from selling half of his collection at $5 per toy and the other half at $7 per toy.

Money from half of the collection at $5 per toy = Number of toys * Price per toy
= 6 * $5
= $30

Money from the other half of the collection at $7 per toy = Number of toys * Price per toy
= 6 * $7
= $42

Finally, to find the total amount of money Matthew would earn, we add the money from both halves:

Total money earned = Money from half at $5 + Money from half at $7
= $30 + $42
= $72

\boxed{72}</s>","Half of Matthew collection means 12 * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 toy soldiers.
A buyer wants to buy 6 toy soldiers for $5, so he would pay 6 * 5 = $<<6*5=30>>30 for them.
And for the other half, he wants to pay $7 per toy, which would sum up to 6 * 7 = $<<6*7=42>>42.
So if Matthew would agree to the buyer's offer, he would earn 30 + 42 = $<<30+42=72>>72.

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. First, we need to calculate the total number of holes the dog dug during Nate's vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes is 6 * 14 = 84.

2. Next, we need to determine how many holes Nate needs to fill in after he gets home. Since the dog continues to dig 6 new holes every night, the total number of holes the dog will dig while Nate is home is the same as the number of holes Nate needs to fill in.

3. Now, we need to calculate how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes he needs to. Nate fills in 9 holes a day, so the number of days it takes him is 84 / 9 = 9.33 days. Since Nate can't work for a fraction of a day, he needs 10 full days to fill in all the holes.

4. Finally, we need to convert the number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes into weeks. We know that 1 week = 7 days, so the total number of weeks it takes Nate is 10 / 7 = 1.42 weeks. Since Nate can't work for a fraction of a week, he needs 2 full weeks to fill in all the holes.

So, the final answer is \boxed{2} weeks.</s>","First find the number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation: 14 days * 6 holes/day = <<14*6=84>>84 holes
Then find the net number of holes Nate fill in each day: 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = <<9-6=3>>3 holes/day
Then divide the total number of holes by the daily decrease in the number of holes to find the number of days Nate spends filling in holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days
Then divide the number of days by the number of days per week to convert the answer to weeks: 28 days / 7 days/week = <<28/7=4>>4 weeks

How many beakers did Igor lose?
                [/INST] First, let's denote the number of beakers Igor gathered as B.

From the problem, we know that Igor gathered:
- Half as many test tubes as requested, so 8 test tubes (16/2)
- Two more Petri dishes than requested, so 16 Petri dishes (14 + 2)
- The correct number of beakers, so B beakers

The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29. So, we can write the equation:

8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + B (beakers) = 29

Solving for B:

B = 29 - 8 - 16
B = 5

So, Igor initially gathered 5 beakers.

However, we also know that Igor lost some beakers on the way to the lab bench. If we denote the number of beakers lost as L, then the number of beakers Igor placed on the lab bench is B - L.

Since we know that Igor placed 5 beakers on the lab bench, we can write:

5 - L = 1

Solving for L:

L = 5 - 1
L = 4

So, Igor lost 4 beakers.

Therefore, the final answer is: \boxed{4}</s>","On the lab bench, there were half of the requested number of test tubes, or 16/2=<<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.

Since the remaining items on the bench were beakers, there were 29-8-16=<<29-8-16=5>>5 beakers on the lab bench.

1. First, we need to find out how many screws are needed to put together all the tables.
   Each table requires 4 legs and each leg requires 2 screws, so each table requires 4 * 2 = 8 screws.

2. Since James is putting together 4 tables, he will need 4 * 8 = 32 screws in total.

1. The problem states that there are 10 eggs in the first basket.

2. It also states that there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as there are in the first. So, the number of eggs in the second basket is 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

3. To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket. So, 10 (from the first basket) + 20 (from the second basket) = 30 eggs.

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is {30 eggs}.</s>","If there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as the 10 in the first basket, this means we multiply 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 eggs in the second basket

                [/INST] Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

1. First, let's find out how much money Sarah raises. Since Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, and Maryam raises $400, we can write the equation: Sarah's money + $400 = $400

2. Solving this equation for Sarah's money gives us: Sarah's money = $400 - $400 = $0

3. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as it would mean Sarah raised no money. It seems there might be a typo in the question. If we assume that the question meant to say ""Alexandra raises $400 more than Sarah"", then the equation becomes: Sarah's money + $400 = $430

4. Solving this equation for Sarah's money gives us: Sarah's money = $430 - $400 = $30

5. Now, we know that all the other girls raised the same amount of money as Sarah, which is $30. So, the total amount they all raised is the sum of each of their amounts. That is: Kim's money + Alexandra's money + Maryam's money + Sarah's money

6. Substituting the known values gives us: $320 (Kim's money) + $430 (Alexandra's money) + ($400 (Maryam's money) - $400 (extra money Maryam raised)) + $30 (Sarah's money)

7. Simplifying this gives us: $320 + $430 + $30 = \boxed{780}

1. Aaron and Vanessa were in a relay race. Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa did. This means if Vanessa's mile speed is V, then Aaron's mile speed is 2V.

2. However, Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did. If Aaron ran 4 miles, then Vanessa ran 8 miles.

3. We know that Aaron's 4 mile time was 16 minutes. To find his time per mile, we divide the total time by the number of miles: 16 minutes / 4 miles = 4 minutes/mile.

4. Since Aaron runs each mile at 4 minutes/mile and he runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's time per mile is twice as long. That's 4 minutes/mile * 2 = 8 minutes/mile.

5. Now, to find out how long Vanessa took to complete her 8 mile part, we multiply her time per mile by the number of miles: 8 minutes/mile * 8 miles = 64 minutes.

The vendor sold all of the 50 watermelons, so the total number sold is 50.

Step 2: Calculate the profit made on selling all the watermelons
The vendor made a 25% profit on selling all the watermelons. So, the profit can be calculated as:
Profit = Cost price * Profit percentage
= $80 * 25/100

Step 3: Calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons
The total selling price of all the watermelons is the cost price plus the profit:
Total selling price = Cost price + Profit
= $80 + $20

                    question:
                    John had a son James when he was 19. ;  James is now twice : as old as ? his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years.  How old will John's : youngest son, who was born when John was 32, be in 3 years?
                [/INST] Here's how we can solve this step by step:

1. Dora will turn 12 years old in 3 years. That means Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
2. We know that James is currently twice as old as Dora. So, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.
3. James was born when John was 19. So, when James was 18, John was 19 + 18 - (18 - 1) = 36 - 17 = 19 years old.
4. The youngest son, Ezekiel, was born when John was 32. So, John was 32 - (36 - 19) = 7 years older when Ezekiel was born.
5. In 3 years, Ezekiel will be 3 + Ezekiel's current age. Since Ezekiel was born when John was 32, Ezekiel's current age is 32 - 7 = 25.
6. So, in 3 years, Ezekiel will be 3 + 25 = 28 years old.

Therefore, in 3 years, Ezekiel will be {28 years old}.</s>","Dora is 12-3=<<12-3=9>>9
So James is 9*2=<<9*2=18>>18 years old
That means John is 18+19=<<18+19=37>>37
Johns youngest son is 37-32=<<37-32=5>>5 years old
So he will be 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 in 3 years

                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to figure out how many oranges each person can peel in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

2. Ana can peel 1 orange in 3 minutes, so in an hour, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

3. Jane can peel 1 orange in 4 minutes, so in an hour, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

4. Now, we subtract the number of oranges Jane has peeled from the number Ana has peeled to find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled.

5. So, Ana has peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final answer is Ana has peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.</s>","There are 60 minutes in an hour. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes so she will peel 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 oranges in an hour
Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes so she will peel 60/4 = <<60/4=15>>15 oranges in an hour
Ana will have peeled 20-15 = <<20-15=5>>5 more oranges

                    : Mark's car breaks down and he needs to get a new radiator.  The , cost for a new radiator is $400 but he goes to get it at a junk shop and gets it for 80% off. ,  He then ? hires a mechanic , to install it and it takes 3 hours at $50 , an hour.  How much did he pay?
                [/INST] Here's how you solve the problem:

1. First, calculate the cost of the radiator after the 80% discount. Discount means to reduce the price by the given percentage. So, to calculate the discounted price, you multiply the original price by (1 - Discount Percentage).
   Cost of radiator = Original price * (1 - Discount Percentage)
   = $400 * (1 - 0.8)
   = $400 * 0.2
   = $80

2. Next, calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. This is a simple multiplication of the hourly rate by the number of hours worked.
   Cost of mechanic = Hourly rate * Hours worked
   = $50 * 3
   = $150

3. Finally, add up these two costs to find the total amount Mark paid.
   Total cost = Cost of radiator + Cost of mechanic
   = $80 + $150
   = $230

So, {The final answer is \boxed{230}}. Mark paid $230 in total.</s>","The discount on the radiator was 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320
So he paid 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80
The mechanic charges 3*50=$<<3*50=150>>150
So in total he paid 80+150=$<<80+150=230>>230

                    Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. : They have a total of 70 legs, all together. How many of the animals are ; chickens?
                [/INST] To find the number of chickens, we can use the total number of legs and the fact that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs.

Step 1: Define variables
Let the number of chickens be x and the number of cows be y.

Step 2: Set up an equation based on the total number of animals
x + y = 20 (since there are 20 animals in total)

Step 3: Set up another equation based on the total number of legs
2x + 4y = 70 (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

Step 4: Solve the system of equations
We can solve this system of equations by first expressing y in terms of x using the first equation:

y = 20 - x

Step 5: Substitute y in the second equation
2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Step 6: Solve for x
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

Step 7: Find the number of cows
y = 20 - x
y = 20 - 5
y = 15

Step 8: Put the final answer inside \boxed
\boxed{The farmer has 5 chickens.}</s>","Let C be the number of chickens.
There are 20-C cows.
The cows have 4*(20-C) legs.
The cows have 2C legs.
The total number of legs is 2C+4(20-C)=70.
2C+80-4C=70

                [/INST] First, let's find out how many slices 7 pizzas have in total. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so 7 pizzas have:

7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends. So, in total, there are 4 people:

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

Therefore, each of Henry and his friends can have 14 slices of pizza if they want to share it equally.
