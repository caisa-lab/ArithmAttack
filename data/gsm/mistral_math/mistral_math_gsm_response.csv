How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?",Betty needs $100 - ($100/2 + $15 + 2*$15) = $100 - ($50 + $15 + $30) = $100 - $95 = $5,5.0
"Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Julie should read tomorrow.
Yesterday, Julie read 12 pages.
Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read 12 * 2 = 24 pages.
The total number of pages she has read so far is 12 + 24 = 36 pages.
The remaining number of pages is 120 - 36 = 84 pages.
Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, so she should read 84 / 2 = 42 pages.
Therefore, Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow.

"Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?","There are 10 yellow flowers in the garden.
There are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers, so there are 10 + (80/100)*10 = 10 + 8 = 18 purple flowers.
There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers, so there are (25/100)*(10 + 18) = 7 green flowers.
In total, Mark has 10 + 18 + 7 = 35 flowers in his garden.

"Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?","The total amount Alexis spent on the shirt, pants, coat, socks, and belt is $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $133.
She has $16 left from her budget, so she spent $200 - $16 = $184 in total.
To find out how much she paid for the shoes, we subtract the total amount spent on other items from the total amount spent: $184 - $133 = $51.
Therefore, Alexis paid $51 for the shoes.",41.0
"Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?","Tina makes $18.00 an hour. If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage. If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?
To calculate her overtime pay, we need to determine how many hours she worked overtime each day. Since she works 10 hours every day, she works 10 - 8 = 2 hours of overtime each day.
Her overtime pay for each day is $18.00 + 1/2 * $18.00 = $18.00 + $9.00 = $27.00
She works 5 days, so her total overtime pay for the week is $27.00 * 5 = $135.00
In addition to her overtime pay, she also earns her regular wage for the 8 hours she works each day. Her regular wage for each day is $18.00 * 8 = $144.00
Her total earnings for the week, including overtime and regular wage, is $135.00 + $144.00 = $279.00
Therefore, Tina makes $279.00 in total.

"Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?","To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of driveways Tobias shoveled.
Let's break down the information given:
Cost of the shoes: $95
Allowance per month: $5
Cost to mow a lawn: $15
Cost to shovel a driveway: $7
Amount of money left after buying the shoes: $15
Number of lawns mowed: 4
We can set up the equation as follows:
Amount of money saved from allowance + Amount of money earned from mowing lawns + Amount of money earned from shoveling driveways - Cost of the shoes = Amount of money left
($5 * 3) + ($15 * 4) + (Number of driveways * $7) - $95 = $15
Let's simplify and solve for the number of driveways:
$15 + $60 + (Number of driveways * $7) - $95 = $15
$75 + (Number of driveways * $7) - $95 = $15
(Number of driveways * $7) - $20 = $15
(Number of driveways * $7) = $35
To solve for the number of driveways, we divide both sides of the equation by $7:
Number of driveways = $35 / $7
Number of driveways = 5
Therefore, Tobias shoveled 5 driveways.

"Jasper will serve charcuterie at his dinner party. He buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, a pound of cream cheese that cost half the price of the cheddar cheese, and a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese. How much does he spend on the ingredients?","The cost of the cheddar cheese is $10 for 2 pounds, so the price per pound is $10/2 = $5/pound.
The cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese, so it costs $5/2 = $2.5/pound.
The pack of cold cuts costs twice the price of the cheddar cheese, so it costs $10*2 = $20.
Therefore, Jasper spends $10 + $2.5 + $20 = $32.5 on the ingredients.
