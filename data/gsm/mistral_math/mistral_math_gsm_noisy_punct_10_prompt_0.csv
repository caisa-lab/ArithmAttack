                    question:
                    Janet’s ducks ; lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes ? muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells ? the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day ! at the farmers' market?
                [/INST] First, let's calculate the number of eggs that are left after Janet eats three for breakfast and bakes four for muffins.

Number of eggs left = Total eggs laid - (Eggs eaten for breakfast + Eggs baked for muffins)
= 16 - (3 + 4)
= 9 eggs

Next, let's calculate how many eggs Janet sells at the farmers' market.

Eggs sold = Eggs left after breakfast and baking
= 9 eggs

Then, let's calculate how much money Janet makes from selling these eggs.

Money made = Eggs sold * Price per egg
= 9 * $2
= $18

So, Janet makes $18 every day from selling fresh duck eggs at the farmers' market.

\boxed{18}</s>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

                    question:
                    A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that , much white fiber.  How many bolts ; in total does it take?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break down the problem:

1. We know that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. It also takes half that amount of white fiber. So, that would be 2 bolts (blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.
3. To find the total amount of bolts, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together.

So, the total number of bolts is 2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = {The final answer is 3 bolts}.</s>","It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric

"Josh decides to try flipping a house.  . He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in ; $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?","<s>[INST] 
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Josh decides to try flipping a house.  . He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in ; $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we'll break it down into clear, step-by-step calculations.

1. First, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred. This includes the initial purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Purchase Price} + \text{Repair Cost} = \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000.
   \]

2. Next, we determine how much the value of the house increased. We know the increase is 150% of the initial value, so we calculate the increase by multiplying the initial value by 150% (or 1.5).
   \[
   \text{Value Increase} = \text{Initial Value} \times 1.5 = \$80,000 \times 1.5 = \$120,000.
   \]

3. To find out the final value of the house, we add the initial value to the value increase.
   \[
   \text{Final Value} = \text{Initial Value} + \text{Value Increase} = \$80,000 + \$120,000 = \$200,000.
   \]

4. Finally, to calculate the profit Josh made, we subtract the total cost from the final value of the house.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Final Value} - \text{Total Cost} = \$200,000 - \$130,000 = \$70,000.
   \]

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $\boxed{\$70,000}$.</s>","The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000

                [/INST] Step 1: Identify the number of sprints James runs per week. He runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, so the total number of sprints per week is 3 * 3 = 9 sprints.

Step 2: Calculate the total distance James runs per week. He runs 60 meters each sprint, so the total distance he runs per week is 9 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters.

Final answer: The final answer is \boxed{540}.</s>","He sprints 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 times
So he runs 9*60=<<9*60=540>>540 meters

How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock ! is 20 chickens?
                [/INST] First, let's find out how much feed Wendi gave to her chickens in total in the morning and afternoon.
The amount of feed given in the morning is 15 cups * flock size = 15 cups * 20 = \boxed{300} cups
The amount of feed given in the afternoon is 25 cups * flock size = 25 cups * 20 = \boxed{500} cups

Now, let's find out how much feed the chickens consume in total each day:
Total feed consumption = morning feed + afternoon feed = 300 cups + 500 cups = \boxed{800} cups

Since Wendi gives the chickens 3 cups of feed per chicken, and there are 20 chickens, we can find out how many meals the chickens get in total:
Total meals = total feed consumption / feed per chicken = \boxed{800} cups / 3 cups/chicken = \boxed{800/3} meals

Since each meal is 1/3 of the total feed for the day, we can find out how many cups of feed are in the final meal:
Final meal size = total feed consumption * (1/3) = \boxed{800} cups * (1/3) = \boxed{800/3} cups
Since Wendi needs to give the final meal of the day in the evening, the final answer is:
The final answer is: \boxed{800/3} cups of feed.</s>","If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.

"Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One ; glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants ! to buy . 16 glasses. How much does ; he need to pay for . them?","<s>[INST] 
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One ; glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants ! to buy . 16 glasses. How much does ; he need to pay for . them?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses in total. Every second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass. This means for every pair of glasses (two glasses), he's paying $5 for the first glass and $3 ($5 * 0.6) for the second glass, totaling $8 per pair.

2. To find out how many pairs of glasses Kylar is buying, we divide the total number of glasses by 2 (since a pair consists of two glasses). So, 16 glasses / 2 = 8 pairs.

3. Now, we multiply the total pairs by the cost per pair to find the total cost. So, 8 pairs * $8 = $64.

{The final answer is} \boxed{64}</s>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

                [/INST] Suppose we start by assigning variables to each city's sheep population. In particular, let's denote the sheep populations in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle as $t$, $c$, and $s$, respectively. We are given three pieces of information:

1. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston: $t  = 2c$.
2. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle: $c  = 4s$.
3. Seattle has 20 sheep: $s  = 20$.

Substituting the value of $s$ into the second equation, we get $c = 4 \times 20  = 80$. Now that we know the sheep population in Charleston, we can substitute it into the first equation to get $t = 2 \times 80 = 160$.

The final answer is that Toulouse has 160 sheep, Charleston has 80 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep, which sums up to a total of 260 sheep altogether. {The final answer is $\boxed{260}$.}</s>","If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which is 2 * 80 sheep = <<2*80=160>>160 sheep
Together, the three has 20 sheep + 160 sheep + 80 sheep = <<20+160+80=260>>260 sheep

Then Carla has to restart the download , from ; the beginning. How load does it take to download the file?
                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Carla is downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute. Normally, the time it would take to download the entire file would be the total size of the file divided by the download speed. So, without any interruptions, the time it would take would be 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

2. However, Carla's download is interrupted by a 20-minute restart for system updates. This means that 40% of her download time is lost to this restart.

3. Since 40% of the download time was lost, Carla now has 60% of her original download time left. So, she has 0.6 * 100 minutes = 60 minutes left to download the file.

4. After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. So, she will download the entire file, not just the remaining 60%. But due to the interrupted nature of her download, she will only be able to use her remaining time effectively.

5. Therefore, the total time it will take Carla to download the file is the time left after the restart plus the restart time itself, which is 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.

{The final answer is 80 minutes}</s>","First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = <<200*40*.01=80>>80 GB

Then find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes
Then add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<40+100+20=160>>160 minutes

                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the distance John drove during his first trip. 
Distance = Speed × Time
Speed = 60 mph
Time = 3 hours
Distance = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance John drove during the second trip before getting stuck in traffic.
He drove for 1/2 hour at a speed of 30 mph.
Time = 1/2 hour
Speed = 30 mph
Distance = 30 mph × 1/2 hour = 15 miles

Step 3: Calculate the distance John drove during the second trip after breaking free from traffic.
He drives for the remaining 30 minutes of the 4-hour trip at a speed of 80 mph.
Since 30 minutes is half an hour, Time = 1/2 hour
Speed = 80 mph
Distance = 80 mph × 1/2 hour = 40 miles

Step 4: Calculate the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours.
Since he turned around and returned to the same spot after his first trip, he didn't cover any distance after the first 180 miles.
In his second trip, he drove 15 miles to get stuck in traffic. After breaking free, he drove 40 miles.
Total distance driven in the second trip = 15 miles + 40 miles = 55 miles

The final answer is {John is 180 miles - 55 miles = 125 miles from home}.</s>","When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home
He was only able to drive 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours in the first four hours

                    Eliza's rate per hour for the : first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives . an ; overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. If Eliza worked for 45 hours this ! week, how much are her earnings for this week?
                [/INST] First, let's identify the given information:
1. Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
2. She receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
3. Eliza worked for 45 hours this week.

Now, let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate Eliza's overtime hourly rate.
Overtime rate = Regular rate * Overtime multiplier
Overtime rate = $10 * 1.2 = $12

Step 2: Calculate the number of overtime hours Eliza worked.
Overtime hours = Total hours worked - Regular hours
Overtime hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

Step 3: Calculate Eliza's regular earnings.
Regular earnings = Regular rate * Regular hours
Regular earnings = $10 * 40 = $400

Step 4: Calculate Eliza's overtime earnings.
Overtime earnings = Overtime rate * Overtime hours
Overtime earnings = $12 * 5 = $60

Step 5: Calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week.
Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is \boxed{460}.</s>","Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.
