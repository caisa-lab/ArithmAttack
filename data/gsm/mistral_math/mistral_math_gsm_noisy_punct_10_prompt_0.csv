                    question:
                    Janet’s ducks ; lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes ? muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells ? the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day ! at the farmers' market?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of fresh duck eggs that Janet can sell at the farmers' market every day. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid daily**: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Subtract the eggs eaten for breakfast**: Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. So, the number of eggs available for other uses is $16 - 3 = 13$ eggs.

3. **Subtract the eggs used for baking muffins**: Janet bakes muffins with 4 eggs every day. Therefore, the number of eggs left for sale is $13 - 4 = 9$ eggs.

4. **Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs**: Janet sells each fresh duck egg at the farmers' market for $2. Therefore, the revenue from selling the remaining eggs is $9 \times 2 = \$18$.

So, Janet makes $\boxed{\$18}$ every day at the farmers' market.</s>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

                    A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that , much white fiber.  How many bolts ; in total does it take?
                [/INST] The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. It also requires half that amount of white fiber. Half of 2 is 1, so the robe requires 1 bolt of white fiber. In total, the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber. {The final answer is 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber}.</s>","It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric

                    Josh decides to try flipping a house.  . He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in ; $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
                [/INST] To calculate Josh's profit from flipping the house, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total investment**: Josh initially bought the house for $80,000 and then invested $50,000 in repairs. The total investment is therefore the sum of these two amounts.
   \[
   \text{Total Investment} = \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000
   \]

2. **Determine the total value after repairs**: The increase in the value of the house due to repairs was 150%. This means the value of the house after repairs was 250% of the initial value (100% original value + 150% increase).
   \[
   \text{Value after Repairs} = \$80,000 \times 250\% = \$80,000 \times 2.5 = \$200,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit**: The profit Josh made is the difference between the value of the house after repairs and the total investment.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Value after Repairs} - \text{Total Investment} = \$200,000 - \$130,000 = \$70,000
   \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made from flipping the house is \(\boxed{\$70,000}\).</s>","The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000

                [/INST] James runs 3 sprints each time he runs, and he runs 3 times a week. Each sprint is 60 meters long.

Step 1: First, calculate how many meters James runs in one session (3 sprints).
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Step 2: Then, calculate how many meters James runs in a week (3 sessions).
180 meters/session * 3 sessions = 540 meters

So, James runs {The final answer is 540 meters} in a week.

(Note: The number inside the \boxed{} indicates the final answer, which is the sum of the total meters James runs in a week.)</s>","He sprints 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 times

How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock ! is 20 chickens?
                [/INST] Let's break it down:

1. In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed, which is enough for 20 chickens.
2. Since each chicken receives 3 cups of feed a day, in the morning alone, Wendi has already given out 20 chickens x 3 cups/chicken = \boxed{60} cups of feed.
3. In the afternoon, she gives another 25 cups of feed, which would cover 25 cups/3 cups/chicken = \boxed{8.33} chickens. Since Wendi has 20 chickens, she still needs to cover 20 - 8.33 = \boxed{11.67} chickens.
4. Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed, so Wendi needs to give 11.67 chickens x 3 cups/chicken = \boxed{35} cups of feed in the final meal of the day to cover all her chickens.</s>","If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.

                    question:
                    Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One ; glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants ! to buy . 16 glasses. How much does ; he need to pay for . them?
                [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of every second glass.
Since every second glass costs 60% of the price of one glass, and one glass costs $5, the cost of every second glass is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of alternating glasses.
Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses and he buys them in pairs of one cheaper and one expensive. So, he buys 8 pairs of glasses. The total cost for these 8 pairs is (8 * $5) + (8 * $3) = $40 + $24 = $64.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost if all glasses were expensive.
If all 16 glasses were expensive (i.e., each cost $5), the total cost would be 16 * $5 = $80.

Step 4: Calculate the difference in cost.
The difference in cost between the actual purchase and the hypothetical purchase with all expensive glasses is $80 - $64 = $16.

Step 5: Calculate the final answer.
Since the difference is the amount saved by buying cheaper glasses, we subtract this difference from the total cost of all expensive glasses to get the actual amount Kylar needs to pay. So, the final answer is $80 - $16 = {The final answer is $64}.</s>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, we multiply the number of sheep Seattle has by 4 to find out how many sheep Charleston has: 20 * 4 = 80 sheep.

3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we multiply the number of sheep Charleston has by 2 to find out how many sheep Toulouse has: 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.

4. Now, to find out how many sheep they all have together, we add up the number of sheep each city has: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260 sheep.

So, the final answer is that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together have 260 sheep. {The final answer is 260 sheep.}</s>","If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which is 2 * 80 sheep = <<2*80=160>>160 sheep
Together, the three has 20 sheep + 160 sheep + 80 sheep = <<20+160+80=260>>260 sheep

                [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. Carla's normal download speed is 2 GB/minute.
2. She needs to download a 200 GB file.
3. 1/5th of the download (20 GB) will be affected by the interruption because 40% of the way through is 1/5th of the total size (40/100 * 200 = 80 GB).
4. The interruption takes 20 minutes.
5. After the interruption, she has to start the download from the beginning.

Now let's calculate the time:

1. Without interruption, the time taken would be 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.
2. 20 GB of the data takes 20 GB / 2 GB/minute = 10 minutes. This is the time it would take to download 40% of the file without interruption.
3. The restart time adds 20 minutes to the total time.

So, the total time taken would be 10 minutes (for the 40% of the download before the interruption) + 20 minutes (interruption time) + 10 minutes (time to download the remaining 60%) = 40 minutes.

                [/INST] Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. In the first part of his trip, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covers is: Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. Despite his initial travel direction, the question doesn't specify a distance to ""home"", so we can't find out how far away he is from ""home"". Instead, we'll focus on his total travel distance for now.

3. After realizing he forgot something, he spends the next 4 hours trying to get home.

4. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic. So, he doesn't cover any distance during these 2 hours.

5. He then drives for a half-hour at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he covers is: Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

6. Finally, he drives the remaining time of the 4 hours (which is 1.5 hours) at a speed of 80 mph. The distance he covers is: Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

7. Adding up all the distances he covered, the total distance John traveled is: 180 miles (first part) + 15 miles (second part) + 120 miles (third part) = 315 miles.

So, {The final answer is that John has traveled a total of 315 miles over the course of the journey.}</s>","When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home

1. First, we need to calculate Eliza's regular earnings for the first 40 hours. This is simple multiplication: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. Next, we calculate the overtime pay. Eliza worked 5 hours overtime (45 hours - 40 hours), and her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate. So, her overtime rate is $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour.

3. Now, we calculate her overtime earnings by multiplying her overtime rate by the number of overtime hours: $12/hour * 5 hours = $60.

4. Finally, we add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week: $400 + $60 = $460.

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are $\boxed{460}$.</s>","Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, but then reduced by 30%. To find out how many downloads the program had in the second month, we first need to calculate three times the downloads from the first month.

1. Calculate the cost of donuts:
   - The cost per dozen is $68, and she bought 3 dozen.
   - So, the total cost for donuts is $68 * 3 = $204.

2. Calculate the cost of mini cupcakes:
   - The cost per dozen is $80, and she bought 2 dozen.

3. Calculate the cost of mini cheesecakes:
   - The cost per dozen is $55, and she bought 6 dozen.
   - So, the total cost for mini cheesecakes is $55 * 6 = $330.

4. Sum up the costs to find the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
   - Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330

                    Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it , take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?
                [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. First, we need to determine how much Carlos earns from selling the lemons each year. He grows 7 lemons per year and sells each for $1.5, so his annual earnings would be 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

2. Next, we calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree each year. The tree costs $90 to plant and $3 a year for water and feed, so the total annual cost is $90 + $3 = $93.

3. Now, we compare these two amounts to see when Carlos starts earning money. If his earnings are less than the total annual cost, he's losing money. If his earnings equal the total annual cost, he's breaking even. If his earnings exceed the total annual cost, he's making a profit.

4. In this case, Carlos's annual earnings are $10.5, which is less than the total annual cost of $93. Therefore, Carlos is losing money in the first year.

5. Since the question asks for when he starts earning money, we know this won't happen in the first year. We can calculate the number of years it takes for him to start earning money by finding the year when his earnings exceed the total annual cost.

6. We know that each year, Carlos's earnings increase by $10.5 (from $10.5 in the first year, to $21 in the second, etc.). He's also incurring a $93 annual cost. So, each year, his losses decrease by $10.5.

7. To find the year when Carlos starts making a profit, we need to find when his net loss (total annual cost minus earnings) becomes zero or negative. Since his net loss decreases by $10.5 each year, we can subtract this amount from the initial loss ($93) until we get a non-positive number.

8. Doing this calculation, we find that Carlos doesn't start making a profit until his 10th year.

\boxed{10} years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.</s>","He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5
He earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5
It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13
