[EXP] question:
                John collects peaches for 3 hours.  {He can collect} 2 peaches a
                minute.  {How} many (the final answer is: [11]) peaches does he collect?
                answer:
                John collects one peach every minute for 3 hours, or 18 minutes.
                He collects 2 peaches times 18 minutes, which equals 36 peaches.
                answer:
                John collects 36 peaches every hour.  Since he collects 36 for
                three hours, that is 108.  So the final answer is 108.
