    [CORRECT] Show your work.
1 truck: (80 stones x 75 lbs/stone) + 2000 = 6000 pounds
2 trucks: (80 stones x 75 lbs/stone) + 4000 = 5600 pounds
So, truck: (80 stones x 75 lbs/stone) + (truck*2000) = 6000 pounds
(80 stones x 75 lbs/stone) + (truck * 1000) = 4000 pounds
Solve: (80 stones x 75 lbs/stone) = 6000 – truck * 1000 pounds
                    (80 stones x 75 lbs/stone) = 6000 – (truck * 1000) pounds
                    The final answer is: 6
