                    question:
                    A landscaping company is delivering flagstones to a customer’s yard. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. If the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip? [/INST]

The answer is 2.  Always start with asking: “How many times something is repeated.” Since we have 80 flagstones and 2000lbs, and we want to know how many times 75lb is repeated, the answer is 80/75=1.

If we had 20 trucks, 20 is bigger than 1.
If we had 11 trucks, 11 is less than 1.

So, how many flagstones can one truck carry? If a truck can carry 2000lbs and a flagstone is 75lbs, the flagstone/truck ratio must be:
75/truck==2000/2000
                     so, 75/truck==1
                     in other words 75xN==2000
                     11xN==27.5
                     so, N=2.083 x 10^0
                     that means, every truck can carry 2 flagstones. So, you would use 2 trucks.</s>",3

    --==[solution]==--
    [INST] 1st step: make sure to read the whole qustion so make sure to read every single one of them.[/INST]
    [INST] 2nd step: take a blank piece of paper and make it look like the picture below[/INST]
                         time: 3 hrs = 3 * 60 = 180 min
                         # of peaches: 2 * #min= 180

    [INST] 3rd step: substitute variables. The question: John collects peaches for 3 hours.  He can collect 2 peaches a minute.  How many peaches does he collect.
    [/INST]
            x= # of peaches
            3= time, in hours it is 3, in minutes it is 3*60=180.
            180= (2*x)
            [substitute 2x into (180)/2 and solve]
            solved: 90 = x</s>",360
