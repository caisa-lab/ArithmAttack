                    So far I've solved for {x} with {number of trucks = }
           A = number of trucks
           {x} = number of flagstone = weight
           {A X 2000} = total weight of all {x}
          80 {x} = 75 {x} for one flagstone
          80X(75) = 75X(80)</s>",3
John collects peaches for 3 hours.  He can collect 2 peaches a minute.  How many peaches does he collect?,"<s> [INST] Let's think step by step and always end the answer with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    John collects peaches for 3 hours.  He can collect 2 peaches a minute.  How many peaches does he collect? [/INST]
                            1008

What I'm wondering about is how the 2 was used in the above.  If we take a minute to think of an example, we'd think of an example that would work in 1 minute right?  So if we were to collect 2 peaches a minute, after the second minute it would be 2+2 and so on.  Therefore, if we had 3 hours, it would total 18 peaches (right?)  We then need to add the last minute to that amount  and get 1008 peaches in 3  hours or so.  It's not quite as straight forward in the context of counting but I think in the context of multiplying the math is pretty straightforward.

In fact though, if you take the total of 18 and add the minute it would be more like 18+2 (to end in 28) but I just wanted to pose my question.

Here's a different example:

                    question:
                    John collects peaches for 1 hour.  How many peaches does he collect? [/INST]
                            130

This question shows me that after the first hour there will be 130 peaches.  Now, even if I could find some example for the above, I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do with the one example.  In my mind the one example is the same as the three.

Can you help?</s>",360
