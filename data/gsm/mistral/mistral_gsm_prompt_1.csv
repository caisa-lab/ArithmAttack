[INST] If you are unsure of the type of question (quantitative, qualitative), ask first.
                    If the situation is a quantitative one, then the answer should be quantitative or numerical.
                    If the situation is qualitative, ask for the final answer.

In this example, it's quantitative. So let's give the final answer the number and units.
