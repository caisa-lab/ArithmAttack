                    question:
                    A landscaping company is delivering flagstones to a customer’s yard. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. If the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip? [/INST]
                    How to begin:
                    The key here is to make sure you are converting from flagstones to pounds and that you are converting those pounds to the weight of each truck. You will also need to figure out how many pounds are in 80 flagstones.

                    How to go on...

                        Show steps:
                 You will want to start with 80 flagstones. The weight of each flagstone is 75 pounds.

                  {If you were to multiply 80*75, you would get 6000 which means it would take 1 truck to transport the 80 flagstones}.

                  {It is important, to make sure the final answer was correct. If you divide 6000 (the weight in pounds) by 2000 (the weight that the truck holds) you would get 3 trucks. This number is correct because this means it would take 3 trucks}.</s>",3
John collects peaches for 3 hours.  He can collect 2 peaches a minute.  How many peaches does he collect?,"<s> [INST] As a math tutor, explain your reasoning step by step for the following problem. Let's think step by step and end the answer with {The final answer is}.

 [INST]As a science teacher,  provide a step by step explaination to the following question.                                                                                                                                                                                                             question:
                    At any instant time, a ball is thrown with an initial height, h0, equal to three times its final height, h.  Find the height at any instant time, t. [/INST]

[SOL] John collects peaches for 3 hours.  He can collect 2 peaches every minute, therefore in 60 minutes we can calculate John would collect 120 peaches [/SOL]

[SOL] This is a position problem with an initial height, h0, of 3. The height will be found by using the equation: position = position at t0 + velocity*t, therefore the final height will be equal to 3 as the initial height was 3 units. [/SOL]
