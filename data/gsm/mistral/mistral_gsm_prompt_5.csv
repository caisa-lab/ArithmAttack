                    question:
                    A landscaping company is delivering flagstones to a customer’s yard. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. If the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip? [/INST]

Answer & Explanation

Solution 1:
    \[ \begin{array}{*{35}{l}}
    \text{Total mass of 80 stones:}& = 80 \left( 75 \right)\text{ pounds}\\ &\qquad\qquad & = 6000 \text{ pounds}\\
    \text{Mass to be loaded by one truck:}& = 2000\text{ pounds}\\
    {}\hspace{3.0em} N \text{trucks are required:}& = \left( 80 \div 2000 \right)\text{truck}\\ &\qquad\qquad & = 4 \text{truck}\\
    \hspace{3.0em} \text{The final answer is:}& 4
    \end{array} \]

Solution 2 [bruteforce]:
    \[ 80 \times 75 = 2000 \]

\[ \frac{2000}{80} = \frac{X}{75} \]

\[ X = \frac{2000 \times 75}{80} = 4 \]

\[ \text{The final answer is: 4} \]

Solution 3 [bruteforce]:
    \[ \frac{80}{2000} = \frac{X}{1 \text{ truck}} = \frac{4}{1 \text{ truck}} \]

        \therefore X = 4</s>",3
