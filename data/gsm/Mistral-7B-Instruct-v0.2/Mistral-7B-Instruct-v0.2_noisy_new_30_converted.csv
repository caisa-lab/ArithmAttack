                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Janet has after eating for breakfast and baking muffins.
- Janet lays 16 eggs per day.
- She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
- She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.

So, Janet has:
16 eggs (laid) - 3 eggs (for breakfast) - 4 eggs (for baking) = <\b 9 eggs </b>

Step 2: Calculate the revenue Janet gets from selling eggs at the farmers' market.
- She sells the eggs for $2 each.
- She has 9 eggs left after cooking.

So, Janet makes:
9 eggs (left) x $2 (per egg) = $<\b 18 </b>

{The final answer is $18. Janet makes $18 in revenue from selling eggs at the farmers' market every day.}</s>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

                    A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. ,  ; How many . bolts ; in ; total . does it take?
                 [/INST] To find the total number of bolts of fiber required to make the robe, we need to calculate the amount of each color separately and then add them together.

First, we know that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.

Next, we're told that it takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. So we need to find half of the 2 bolts of blue fiber:

1/2 * 2 bolts = 1 bolt

Therefore, the robe takes 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, to get the total number of bolts required, we add the amount of each color:

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
           = 2 bolts + 1 bolt
           = 3 bolts

{The final answer is: 3 bolts}</s>","It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how much Josh spent on the house and repairs in total.
Josh spent $80,000 on the house and $50,000 on repairs.
So, Josh's total investment was $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000.

Step 2: Find out how much the house is now worth after the repairs.
According to the problem, the repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.
So, the increased value of the house is $80,000 * 1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000.

Step 3: Calculate the profit made by Josh.
To find the profit, subtract the total investment from the current value of the house.
Profit = Current value - Total investment
Profit = $120,000 - $130,000
Profit = -$<<120000-130000=-100000>>100,000

Step 4: Analyze the problem, and if there's a mistake, correct it.
Based on the information given, Josh had a loss of $100,000.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many sprints James runs per week.
James runs 3 sprints per day, and he trains 3 days a week. So the total number of sprints he runs in a week is:
3 sprints/day * 3 days/week = 9 sprints/week

Step 2: Find out the distance James runs in one sprint.
James runs 60 meters during each sprint.

Step 3: Calculate the total distance James runs in a week.
Total distance = Distance per sprint * Number of sprints per week
Total distance = 60 meters/sprint * 9 sprints/week = 540 meters/week

{The final answer is: James runs a total of 540 meters per week.}</s>","He sprints 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 times

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many cups of feed Wendi gives to each chicken per day.
Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day.

Step 2: Find out how many chickens Wendi has in her flock.
The size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens.

Step 3: Determine how many cups of feed Wendi gives to her chickens in each meal.
Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. Since she gives her chickens three separate meals, we can divide the total amount of feed given per day by 3 to find the number of cups she gives to each chicken in one meal.

Total amount of feed given per day = 15 cups (morning) + 25 cups (afternoon) = 40 cups
Number of cups of feed per meal = Total amount of feed given per day / Number of chickens = 40 cups / 20 chickens = 2 cups per chicken per meal

Step 4: Find the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give to her chickens in the final meal of the day.
Since each chicken receives 2 cups of feed in the final meal, the total number of cups of feed Wendi needs is:
Total cups of feed = Number of chickens * Cups per chicken = 20 chickens * 2 cups/chicken = 40 cups.

{The final answer is 40 cups}.</s>","If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the cost of each regular glass and the discounted cost of each second glass.
- The cost of one regular glass is $5.
- Every second glass costs 60% of the price of a regular glass.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of a discounted glass.
- A discounted glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Step 3: Determine how many discounted glasses and regular glasses Kylar wants to buy.
- Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses in total.
- Since we now know that one regular glass costs $5 and each discounted glass costs $3, let's find out how many discounted glasses Kylar can buy with the same amount of money as for 1 regular glass.

Step 4: Calculate the number of discounted glasses Kylar can buy instead of one regular glass.
- $5 is the cost of one regular glass.
- To find out how many discounted glasses Kylar can buy instead, we divide the cost of a regular glass by the cost of a discounted glass: $5 / $3 = 1.67 (approximately). Since Kylar cannot buy a fraction of a glass, he can buy only 1 discounted glass instead of 1 regular glass.

Step 5: Calculate the number of regular glasses and discounted glasses Kylar wants to buy.
- Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses in total.
- Since he can buy one discounted glass instead of one regular glass, he will buy 15 discounted glasses and 1 regular glass.

Step 6: Calculate the cost of all discounted glasses and the regular glass.
- The cost of 15 discounted glasses is $15 (15 * $3).
- The cost of 1 regular glass is $5.

Step 7: Calculate the total cost for Kylar.
- The total cost for Kylar is the cost of all discounted glasses plus the cost of the regular glass: $15 + $5 = $20.

The final answer is: Kylar needs to pay $20 for all 16 glasses.</s>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

                    question:
                    . Toulouse ; has twice as many sheep as ? Charleston. Charleston ; has 4 times as . many sheep as ? Seattle. How many sheep do ; Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together if Seattle ; has 20 ; sheep?
                 [/INST] Let's break this problem down into smaller parts and solve each one step by step:

1. Charleston has x number of sheep, and Toulouse has 2x number of sheep.
2. Seattle has 4x number of sheep.
3. We're given that Seattle has 20 sheep.

From the information given, we have the relationships:

- Charleston :x: Toulouse : 2x
- Charleston :x: Seattle : 4x

We're also given that Seattle has 20 sheep, which can be written as:

- Seattle :20

Now, we can set up two equations based on the given relationships:

1. x : 2x :: Charleston : Toulouse
2. x : 4x :: Charleston : Seattle

From the first relationship, we can determine that Toulouse has 2x = 2 * x = 2 * (Charleston's sheep) = 2 * x = 2 * (x) = 2 * 1 * x = 2x sheep.

From the second relationship, we can determine that Seattle has 4x = 4 * (Charleston's sheep) = 4 * (x) = 4 * 1 * x = 4x sheep.

Since we know that Seattle has 20 sheep, we can set up the equation 4x = 20. Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find x = 5.

Now that we have the number of sheep for Charleston, x = 5, and we know that Toulouse has 2x = 2 * 5 = 10 sheep and Seattle has 4x = 4 * 5 = 20 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together:

Total = Charleston + Toulouse + Seattle
Total = 5 + 10+20
Total = 25

{The final answer is 25 sheep for Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle combined.}</s>","If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which is 2 * 80 sheep = <<2*80=160>>160 sheep
Together, the three has 20 sheep + 160 sheep + 80 sheep = <<20+160+80=260>>260 sheep

Then Carla has to . restart ! the download . from the beginning. How load does it ! take ! to , download the , file?
                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Initially, Carla can download 2 GB/minute. So, the download rate is 2 GB/minute.
2. The file is 200 GB. To find out how long it takes to download the file initially, we can use the formula: time = size / rate
   time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
   time = 100 minutes
3. However, she was 40% through the download when Windows forced her to restart. So, she had downloaded 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB before the interruption.
4. After the restart, the download process starts from the beginning. The remaining download size is 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB.
5. Since the download speed remains the same (2 GB/minute), the time to complete the remaining download would be: time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes
6. Previously, it took 100 minutes to download the full 200 GB file, but she was interrupted halfway through, so she ended up downloading 80 GB in the first 80 minutes.
7. After the interruption and restart, it took an additional 60 minutes to download the remaining 120 GB.
8. Therefore, the total download time was 80 minutes (first download) + 60 minutes (after the interruption and restart) = 140 minutes. {The final answer is: It takes 140 minutes (or 2 hours and 20 minutes) to download the file.}</s>","First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = <<200*40*.01=80>>80 GB
Then divide that number by the download rate to find the time until Windows restarts: 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes
Then find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes
Then add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<40+100+20=160>>160 minutes

1. Find out how far John drives during each segment of his trip, given the lengths of time and speeds involved.

Segment 1: John drives at 60 mph for 3 hours. 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance1 = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Segment 2: John is stuck in traffic for 2 hours and doesn't move.
No distance is covered during this segment.

Segment 3: John drives at 30 mph for a half-hour (30 minutes).

Distance2 = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

Segment 4: John drives at 80 mph for the remaining 2.5 hours.
Distance3 = Speed * Time
Distance3 = 80 mph * 2.5 hours = 200 miles

2. Find the total distance John travels during his entire trip.
Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 + Distance3
Total Distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 200 miles = 395 miles

Regular hourly rate = Given hourly wage
Regular hourly rate = $10

Step 2: Calculate Eliza's overtime hourly rate. Overtime is paid at 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.

Overtime hourly rate = Regular hourly rate * 1.2
Overtime hourly rate = $10 * 1.2
Overtime hourly rate = $12

Step 3: Determine how many hours Eliza worked that qualified for overtime pay. Since she worked 45 hours this week and the first 40 hours were paid at her regular hourly rate, we can find the number of overtime hours.

Overtime hours = Total weekly hours - Regular hours
Overtime hours = 45 hours - 40 hours
Overtime hours = 5 hours

Step 4: Calculate Eliza's earnings for her regular hours.

Regular earnings = Regular hourly rate * Regular hours
Regular earnings = $10 * 40 hours
Regular earnings = $400

Step 5: Calculate Eliza's earnings for her overtime hours.

Overtime earnings = Overtime hourly rate * Overtime hours
Overtime earnings = $12 * 5 hours
Overtime earnings = $60

Step 6: Find Eliza's total earnings for the week.

Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
Total earnings = $400 + $60
Total earnings = $460

{The final answer is: Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.}</s>","Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.

Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.

We know that the number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month. So,

Downloads in the second month = 3 * Downloads in the first month = 3 * 60 = 180

Step 2: Calculate the number of downloads in the third month.
The number of downloads in the third month was a reduction of 30% from the number of downloads in the second month. So,

Downloads in the third month = 0.7 * Downloads in the second month = 0.7 * 180 = 126

Step 3: Find the total number of downloads over the three months.
Total downloads = Downloads in the first month + Downloads in the second month + Downloads in the third month

                 [/INST] To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then add them together.

1. Cost of donuts:
   Toula bought 3 dozen donuts, and each dozen costs $68. So, the cost of donuts is:
   Cost of donuts = Number of dozens * Cost per dozen
   Cost of donuts = 3 * $68
   Cost of donuts = $204

2. Cost of mini cupcakes:
   Toula bought 2 dozens of mini cupcakes, and each dozen costs $80. So, the cost of mini cupcakes is:
   Cost of mini cupcakes = Number of dozens * Cost per dozen
   Cost of mini cupcakes = 2 * $80
   Cost of mini cupcakes = $160

3. Cost of mini cheesecakes:
   Toula bought 6 dozens of mini cheesecakes, and each dozen costs $55. So, the cost of mini cheesecakes is:
   Cost of mini cheesecakes = Number of dozens * Cost per dozen
   Cost of mini cheesecakes = 6 * $55
   Cost of mini cheesecakes = $330

4. Total cost:
   To find the total cost, we add the cost of each type of pastry:
   Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
   Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330
   Total cost = $694

{The final answer is $694}.</s>","The total charge for the doughnuts was 3 x $68 = $<<3*68=204>>204.
The total charge for the mini cupcakes was 2 x $80 = $<<2*80=160>>160.
The total charge for the mini cheesecakes was 6 x $55 = $<<6*55=330>>330.
Therefore the total amount Toula paid for the pastries was $204 + $160 + $330 = $<<204+160+330=694>>694.

The tree produces 7 lemons each year, and each lemon is sold for $1.5. So, the annual profit from selling lemons is: 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year

Step 2: Calculate the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree.
The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

Step 3: Determine the number of years it takes for the tree to start earning money.
To determine the break-even point, we need to compare the annual profit to the annual cost. In this case:
- Annual profit: $10.5
- Annual cost: $3

First, let's see if the tree makes a profit in the first year.
$10.5 (annual profit) > $3 (annual cost)

Since the annual profit is greater than the annual cost in the first year, the answer is not how many years but the tree starts earning money in the first year itself.

It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as X. We know she sold a third at the green house, so she had X/3 vacuum cleaners left. Then she sold twice as many to the red house, so she had X/3 - 2*X/2 = X/6 vacuum cleaners left. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she had X/6/2 = X/3 vacuum cleaners left.

Since Melanie had 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation: X/3 + X/6 + X/3 = 5.

To solve this equation, we can first find a common denominator by making all the denominators equal to 3. Then we can add the fractions: (2X/3) + (X/3) + (X/3) = 5. Solving for X, we find: 4X = 15. X = 15/4 = 3.75.

However, since the number of vacuum cleaners must be a whole number, this solution does not make sense. Therefore, there is an error in the problem, and it cannot be solved with the given information.

20% of 20! students enroll in contemporary dance:
Number of students in contemporary dance = Total students * Percentage
Number of students in contemporary dance = 20! * 0.2
Number of students in contemporary dance = 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 students.

Step 2: Find the number of students enrolled in jazz dance.
Remaining students = Total students - Students in contemporary dance
Number of students in jazz dance = Remaining students * Percentage
Number of students in jazz dance = (20! - 80) * 0.25
Number of students in jazz dance = <<(20!-80)*0.25=(1600-80)*0.25=400>>400 students.

Step 3: Find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
Students in hip-hop dance = Total students - Students in contemporary dance - Students in jazz dance

1. Jewelry worth $5,000:
If the jewelry market goes up 2.5%, the expected value of the jewelry will be:
$5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,125
So the expected profit from this plan would be:
$125 = $5,125 - $5,000

2. Electronic gadgets worth $8,000:
If the electronic gadgets market goes up 1.2%, the expected value of the gadgets will be:
$8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,192
So the expected profit from this plan would be:
$192 = $8,192 - $8,000

Comparing the expected profits, the merchant will make more profit by purchasing the electronic gadgets.

{The final answer is: $192}

This is the expected profit the merchant would make if he chooses the purchase plan with electronic gadgets worth $8,000 and both markets follow the expected rates of growth.

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Claire consumes daily.
Since she makes a 3-egg omelette every morning, the number of eggs she consumes daily is 3 eggs.

Step 2: Determine the number of eggs she consumes weekly.
As she eats 3 eggs daily, in a week (consisting of 7 days) she would eat:
3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week

Step 3: Find out the number of eggs she consumes in a month.
A month usually has 4 weeks (except for some leap years). So, the number of eggs Claire eats monthly is:
21 eggs/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 eggs/month

To find the number of eggs she eats in dozens, we need to divide the monthly consumption by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen).

Step 4: Convert the monthly consumption to dozens.
Number of dozens = Monthly consumption / Number of eggs in a dozen
Number of dozens = 84 eggs/month / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens/month

Given:
- Marissa has walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour.
- Marissa has walked the next 2 miles in 1 hour.

Let's calculate the time and distance for each part of her hike:

First, calculate the distance covered and time spent during the first part of her hike (4 miles at 1 hour):
distance_first = 4 miles
time_first = 1 hour

Next, calculate the distance covered and time spent during the second part of her hike (2 miles at 1 hour):
distance_second = 2 miles
time_second = 1 hour

Now, we have the total distance (4 + 2 = 6 miles) and total time (1 + 1 = 2 hours) spent hiking.

We want to find the speed (in miles per hour) that Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

First, we calculate her total distance hiked (6 miles).

Next, we calculate the total time spent hiking (2 hours) and use the formula:
average_speed = (total_distance / total_time)

4 miles/hour = (6 miles / total_time)

Solving for total_time, we get:

total_time = (6 miles / 4 miles/hour) = 1.5 hours

Since we know Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking, we need to find the remaining distance that she needs to cover and the time it would take her to cover that distance at 4 miles per hour.

To find the remaining time, we subtract the total time Marissa has spent hiking from her estimated completion time:

estimated_completion_time = 2 hours (total time spent) + 1.5 hours (remaining time)

estimated_completion_time = 3.5 hours

Now, since we know she needs to cover that distance in 3.5 hours at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can find the length of the remaining trail using the formula:

distance = average_speed * time

We're given that Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour. So the remaining distance is:

remaining_distance = 4 miles/hour * 3.5 hours = 14 miles

{The final answer is: Marissa needs to walk at 4 miles per hour to cover the remaining 14 miles of the trail.}</s>","First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours

Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph

Orange drink: 10 liters, two-thirds water. So, the amount of water in orange drink is (2/3) * 10 L = 6.67 L.
The lost liter of orange drink is 1 L. So, the amount of orange drink left is 9.67 L.

Pineapple drink: 15 liters, three-fifths water. So, the amount of water in pineapple drink is (3/5) * 15 L = 9 L.

Step 2: Now, let's find the total amount of water in the remaining drinks.

Total water in orange drink left = 9.67 L (subtracting the spilled liter)
Total water in pineapple drink = 9 L

Step 3: Add the amounts of water from both drinks to find the total water in the remaining 24 liters.

Total water = Water in orange drink left + Water in pineapple drink
Total water = 9.67 L + 9 L
Total water = 18.67 L

Step 4: Since the question asked for the answer in liters, the final answer is:

                    Raymond : and Samantha are ! cousins. Raymond was born 6 , years before Samantha. Raymond had a . son at the ? age of ! 23. : If Samantha ? is now . 31, how . many years ago was Raymond's son born?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the relationship between Raymond and Samantha.
Given that Raymond is Samantha's cousin, we know that they share a common ancestor. However, the generation of that common ancestor is not provided in the information given.

Step 2: Find the age difference between Raymond and Samantha.
Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. So, Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha.

Step 3: Find the age when Raymond had a son.
Raymond had a son at the age of 23.

Step 4: Find the current age of Samantha.
Samantha is currently 31 years old.

Step 5: Use the information provided to calculate the age of Raymond's son.
Since Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, and he had a son when he was 23, we can find the age of Raymond's son by adding the ages of Raymond and his son at the time of the son's birth.

Age of Raymond at son's birth = Raymond's age + Son's age
Age of Raymond at son's birth = 23 + 6
Age of Raymond at son's birth = 29

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 29 - Raymond's current age = 29 - 35 = -6 years ago.

However, since a person cannot be born 6 years ago from an event that already happened in the past, this answer indicates that there is an error in the problem statement or the given information is inconsistent.

As it stands, the problem as presented is not solvable with the provided information. {The final answer cannot be determined with the given information.}</s>","When Raymond's son was born Samantha was 23 - 6 = <<23-6=17>>17 years old.

2. The discount was 25% of the original price.
3. Let's represent the original price as ""x.""
4. The discount amount is 25% of x, or 0.25x.
5. The purchase price ($19.50) is equal to the original price minus the discount, so x - 0.25x = $19.50.
6. Simplifying this equation, we get 0.75x = $19.50.

                 [/INST] Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. We know Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12.
2. She also bought 5 packs of milk, with each pack costing $3. So the cost of the milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
3. Marie bought 4 apples, with each apple costing $1.50. So the cost of the apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.
4. The total cost of the meal (chicken, milk, and apples) is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.
5. We know the total cost of the meal and the boxes of pizza was $50. So the cost of the boxes of pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.
6. We also know each box of pizza costs $8.50. So the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is $17 / $8.50 ≈ 2 boxes.

Therefore, the final answer is Marie ordered approximately 2 boxes of pizza. {The final answer is ≈ 2 boxes}</s>","Five packs of milk cost $3 x 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.

2. She is considering the boots and two pairs of high heels.
3. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots.
4. One pair of high heels costs $33.
5. The other pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair.
6. To find the cost of the second pair of high heels, we need to find twice the cost of the first pair: $33 * 2 = $66
7. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $33 + $66 = $99.
8. The boots cost more than the total cost of the two pairs of high heels, so the boots must cost at least $100.

1. Let x represent Darrell's age and y represent Allen's age. We know that their ages have a ratio of 7:11.
2. We're given that their total age is 162, so x + y = 162.
3. Now, we have twovariables, so we need another equation to solve for both x and y. Since their ages have a ratio of 7:11, we can write the equation x/y = 7/11.
4. To eliminate one variable, we can cross-multiply this equation: x = 7y/11.
5. Substitute the expression for x from step 4 into the equation x + y = 162: 7y/11 + y = 162.
6. Multiply both sides by 11 to eliminate the fraction: 7y + 11y = 1764.
7. Combine like terms: 18y = 1764.
8. Divide both sides by 18 to isolate y: y = 97.89 (approximately). Since ages are whole numbers, round y to the nearest integer: y = 98.
9. Find Darrell's age by using the ratio equation x = 7y/11: x = 7*(98)/11 = 584.5 (approximately). Again, round x to the nearest integer: x = 585.

Therefore, Darrell's age is currently 585 and Allen's age is 98.

Average guess = (Guess of Friend 1 + Guess of Friend 2 + Guess of Friend 3) / Number of Friends

Average guess = (x + (x + 20) + 1.25x) / 3

                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many jewels Aaron has:
1. Aaron has 5 more jewels than Siobhan, and Raymond has half as many jewels as Aaron.
2. Therefore, the number of Aaron's jewels is 5 more than Siobhan's jewels plus the number of Siobhan's jewels.
3. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels.
4. Half of Raymond's jewels belong to Aaron, so Aaron has 40 / 2 = <<40/2=20>>20 jewels.
5. Subtracting the 5-jewel difference between Aaron and Siobhan, we find that Siobhan has 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 jewels.

{The final answer is 15}.</s>","Half of Raymond's jewels is 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20
Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, he has 20+5 = <<5+20=25>>25 jewels.

- Mike plays ping pong for a total of 40 minutes.
- He scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.
- He scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes than he did in the first 20 minutes.

Step 2: Find the number of points Mike scores in the second 20 minutes.
- Mike scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes than he did in the first 20 minutes.
- In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
- Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points + 25% of 4 points.

Step 3: Calculate the number of points Mike scores in the second 20 minutes.
- 4 points + 0.25 * 4 points = 4 points + 1 point = 5 points

Step 4: Find the total number of points Mike scores.
- Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total revenue John gets from selling all his Lego sets.
John has 13 Lego sets and sells each one for $15. So, the total revenue is: 13 sets * $15/set = $195.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the video games John bought.
John bought 8 video games at $20 each. So, the total cost is: 8 games * $20/game = $160.

Step 3: Find out how much money John has left after buying the video games.
The total money John had is $195 (from selling the Lego sets). He spent $160 on video games. So, the money left is: $195 - $160 = $35.

Step 4: Find out how many Lego sets John still has based on the given information.
John sold 13 sets to get $195. He still has $35. To find out how many more sets he can sell for $35, we calculate $35 ÷ $15 = 2.33 ≈ 2 sets. Since John can't sell a fraction of a set, he still has 13 sets - 11 sets sold = 2 sets that were not included in the original calculation.

Therefore, the final answer is: John still has 2 Lego sets.</s>","He spent $160 on video games because 8 x 20 = <<8*20=160>>160

                 [/INST] To find out how fast John runs per hour, we first need to find out how many miles he runs in one hour.

We know that John runs 60 miles a week, and he runs 3 days a week. So, the number of miles he runs in one day is:

Miles per day = Miles per week / Days per week
Miles per day = 60 miles / 3 days
Miles per day = 20 miles

Now we know that John runs 20 miles a day, and he runs for 3 hours on the first day. So, we can calculate his speed on the first day:

Speed on first day = Distance / Time
Speed on first day = 20 miles / 3 hours
Speed on first day = 6.67 miles/hour

However, on the other two days, John runs for half the time he runs on the first day. So, he runs for 1.5 hours on each of those days.

Therefore, his total weekly running time is:

Total weekly running time = 3 hours/day * 3 days/week + 1.5 hours/day * 2 days/week
Total weekly running time = 9 hours + 3 hours
Total weekly running time = 12 hours

Since there are 168 hours in a week (7 days/week * 24 hours/day), we can find out what percentage of his total weekly time is spent running:

Percentage of total weekly time spent running = Running time / Total weekly time
Percentage of total weekly time spent running = 12 hours / 168 hours
Percentage of total weekly time spent running = 0.0714, or 7.14%

Therefore, on average, John spends less than 8% of his time running. Based on the given information, we cannot find his exact speed while running because we don't have enough information about the pace at which he runs on the other two days.</s>","He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.
He runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.
So for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.
So in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.
So he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.

                 [/INST] Let's first find out how fast Dana can walk and run. We are given that:
1. Dana can walk at X miles per hour.
2. She can run at 4X miles per hour.
3. She can skip at 1.5X miles per hour.

We know that she spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking. Let's assume she spends T total hours for this.

First, let's find out the total distance she covers:

1. Time spent running (R) = T * 1/3
   Distance covered running = R * 4X

2. Time spent walking (W) = T * 2/3
   Distance covered walking = W * X

Total distance = Distance covered running + Distance covered walking

So, the total distance equation would be:
(1/3 * T * 4X) + (2/3 * T * X) = Total distance

Or, simplifying:
(4X * T/3) + (X * T/2) = Total distance

However, we don't have enough information to find the actual value for the total distance. We're given her skipping speed (3 mph), but that doesn't help us determine her walking or running speed directly. The relationship given between walking, running, and skipping speeds doesn't provide enough information to calculate them independently. {The final answer cannot be determined solely based on the given information.}

If we had more information about her walking, running, or skipping speeds, we could calculate the total distance covered in 6 hours.

For example, if we knew that she could walk at 3 miles per hour, her running speed would be 12 miles per hour (3 * 4), and skipping speed was halved to 1.5 miles per hour, we could determine the amount of time spent running and walking based on her total time of 6 hours and calculate the corresponding distances using the given time ratios. However, without this further information, we cannot definitively answer the question.</s>","If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

1. We know that Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone.
2. We also know that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone.
3. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is (2 times older than Suzy's) x 4.
4. Since Ben's iPhone is 2 times older than Suzy's iPhone and Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, Ben's iPhone is 2 x 1 = 2 years old.

                 [/INST] To find out how far Polly can stand holding the sapphire gemstone and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin, we need to calculate the new reach of the javelin throw.

1. Without the sapphire gemstone, the gold javelin can be thrown for a distance of 400 feet.
2. With the sapphire gemstone, the gold javelin can be thrown three times farther. So, the new reach of the javelin is 400 feet + (3 * 400) = 1600 feet.
3. The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet.
4. To hit the dragon, Polly must throw the javelin beyond the dragon's reach and have it come back to within the dragon's 1000-foot reach.
5. Let's determine how far the javelin would travel before it comes back to the dragon's reach. If we consider the dragon's reach as a circle with a radius of 1000 feet, then the javelin must travel beyond this circle and come back within it.
6. The javelin travels 1600 feet before returning, so we need to find where it would intersect the circle. The distance from the center of the circle (dragon) to the point of intersection is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 1000 feet and 1600 feet.
7. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse: 1000^2 + 1600^2 = x^2. Solving for x, we get x≈2375.35 feet.
8. Since the dragon's reach has a radius of 1000 feet, the point where the javelin intersects the dragon's flames is at a distance of about 2375.35 feet from the dragon's location.
9. Therefore, Polly must stand closer than 2375.35 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames to hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

{The final answer is about 1364.65 feet (2375.35 - 1000) outside the reach of the dragon's flames}</s>","With the gemstone, Polly could throw the javelin 3 times farther than 400 feet, for a distance of 3*400=<<3*400=1200>>1200 feet.

1. We know that there are 5 servings in a 300g bag of chips and each serving contains 250 calories.
2. So, the total number of calories in the entire 300g bag is: 250 calories/serving * 5 servings/bag = 1250 calories/bag
3. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories.
4. To calculate how many calories you have left to consume, subtract the calories you have already consumed from your daily calorie target: 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories
5. However, since you're interested in the weight of the chips you can still eat, not the calories, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to these remaining 200 calories.
6. We know that there are 250 calories in each serving of chips, so we can find out how many calories are in 1 gram of chips by dividing the number of calories in a serving by the weight of the serving in grams: 250 calories/serving / 250 grams/serving = 1 calorie/gram
7. Now we can calculate how many grams of chips you can still eat: 200 calories / 1 calorie/gram = 200 grams

The final answer is: You can eat 200 grams of chips.</s>","If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat
If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams

1 pound of beeswax = 10 tapered candles

Step 2: Find the cost of beeswax and supplies for making 20 candles.
Cost of 1 pound of beeswax = $10.00
Number of pounds of beeswax needed = 20 candles / 10 candles per pound
= 2 pounds
Total cost of beeswax = 2 pounds * $10.00/pound = $20.00

Step 3: Find the total cost of supplies for 20 candles.
Cost of supplies per candle = $10.00 (includes beeswax and wicks)
Total number of candles = 20
Total cost of supplies = 20 candles * $10.00/candle = $200.00

Step 4: Find the selling price for 20 candles.
Selling price per candle = $2.00
Total revenue from selling 20 candles = 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00

Step 5: Find Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles.
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - ($20.00 in beeswax + $200.00 in supplies)
Net profit = $40.00 - $220.00
Net profit = -$180.00

However, the above calculation shows a loss, not a profit.

Since the problem states that Charlie wants to make a profit, it appears there is a mistake in the given information. The cost of supplies per pound of beeswax is likely too high. To find the net profit, the cost of supplies should be lowered until a positive number is obtained.

{The final answer is: To find the correct net profit, adjust the cost of supplies until a positive number is obtained.}</s>","1 pound of beeswax and the wick make 10 candles and he wants to make 20 candles so he needs 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 pounds of beeswax

1. Find out how many Post-it notes Candice had before she left home.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work to find out how many were in the package she bought.

Step 1: Find out how many Post-it notes Candice had before she left home.
She put 80 notes in her purse before she left for work. After buying more at the store, she had 23 notes remaining. So the total number of Post-it notes Candice had before she left home was: 80 + 23 = 103 notes.

Step 2: Find out how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice bought.
We know that after buying the package, she used one note on each of 220 coffee cups, and she had 23 notes remaining. So the number of notes in the package she bought was: 220 * 1 (notes used per cup) + 23 (notes remaining) = 221 notes.
However, Candice initially had 103 notes, so the number of notes in the package she bought was: 103 - 220 (used at work) = 117 notes.

Therefore:
{The final answer is}: Candice purchased a package of 117 Post-it notes.</s>","Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.
Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.

                 [/INST] To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. Let x be the number of blue ties John bought.
2. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2x.
3. The cost of blue ties is $200, so the cost of each blue tie is $40. Therefore, the total cost of blue ties is 2x * $40 = $80x.
4. The cost of red ties is 50% more than the cost of blue ties. So, the cost of red ties is 1.5 * $80x = $120x.
5. John spent a total of $200 on ties. So, $80x (blue ties) + $120x (red ties) = $200.
6. Solving this equation for x, we find that x = $200 / ($80 + $120) = $200 / $200 = 1. So, John bought 1 unit of blue ties.
7. Since he bought twice as many red ties, he bought 2 units of red ties.
8. The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie, so the cost of each red tie is $40 * 1.5 = $60.
9. Therefore, the cost of 2 red ties is 2 * $60 = $120.

{The final answer is: John spent $120 on ties.}</s>","He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties
So he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties
Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the number of pieces Tracy obtained from the 4-foot-long wire by cutting it into 6-inch-long pieces:

1. The length of each piece is 6 inches.
2. The total length of the wire is 4 feet = 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches).
3. To find out how many pieces Tracy can get, divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

Number of pieces = Total length of the wire / Length of one piece
= 48 inches / 6 inches/piece
= 8 pieces

However, the question is asking for the number of pieces obtained after the wire has been cut. Since each piece was cut into 6-inch-long pieces, we need to divide the length of the wire by the length of one piece (before cutting) and then multiply it by the number of pieces obtained from one foot of wire (since the wire was 4 feet long and 1 foot = 12 inches):

1. Length of one piece before cutting = 6 inches
2. The wire is 48 inches, so the actual number of pieces will be:
Number of pieces after cutting = Number of pieces from one foot / Number of pieces from one foot * Total number of pieces from the wire
= 12 inches / 6 inches/piece * 8 pieces
= 12 pieces / 3 inches/piece * 8 pieces
= 24 pieces

So, the final answer is: {Tracy obtained 24 pieces from the 4-foot-long wire after cutting it into 6-inch-long pieces}.</s>","If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the total number of units in the building.
Each floor contains 8 units, and there are 15 floors in the building.
Total number of units = Units per floor * Number of floors
Total number of units = 8 * 15
Total number of units = 120 * 15
Total number of units = 1800

Step 2: Find the number of occupied units.
3/4 of the building is occupied.
Number of occupied units = Total number of units * Occupancy rate
Occupancy rate = 3/4 = 0.75
Number of occupied units = 1800 * 0.75
Number of occupied units = 1350

Step 3: Find the number of unoccupied units.
Number of unoccupied units = Total number of units - Number of occupied units
Number of unoccupied units = 1800 - 1350
Number of unoccupied units = 450

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how long it takes Tom to sail from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

Step 2: The distance Tom sails during this period can be calculated using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time. Since we are given the speed (10 miles per hour) and the start and end times, we can calculate the time it takes him to reach his destination.

Step 3: To calculate the time, we'll first find the number of hours between 1:00 PM and 4:00 PM, which is 3 hours. Now, we can use the formula mentioned above:

Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

Step 4: So, Tom covers a distance of 30 miles in 3 hours during his journey from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM.

Step 5: Now, we need to find out how long it takes Tom to travel back to his original position at a rate of 6 miles per hour.

Step 6: Using the same formula (Distance = Speed * Time), we can find the time it takes Tom to travel back:

Distance = 30 miles (the distance Tom sailed during his journey from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM)
Speed = 6 miles/hour

Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours

Step 7: Finally, we've determined that it takes Tom a total of 3 hours to sail to his destination and 5 hours to return. Hence, the total time taken for this round trip is:

Total Time = 3 hours (sailing to the destination) + 5 hours (returning) = 8 hours

{The final answer is: It takes Tom 8 hours to complete the round trip.}</s>","He was travelling at full speed for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his bag. Comic books weigh 1/4 pound each.

Let x be the number of comic books Uriah needs to remove.
Weight of removed comic books = x * Weight of each comic book
15 = x * 1/4
x = 15 * 4
x = 60

Uriah needs to remove 60 comic books.

Step 2: Determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove.
Let y be the number of toys Uriah needs to remove.
Weight of removed toys = y * Weight of each toy
0 = 1/2 * y - 15 - 60 * 1/4
2y = 75 + 30 * 0.5
y = (75 + 15) / 0.5
y = 160 / 0.5
y = 320 / 1
y = 320

Uriah needs to remove 320 toys.

However, this answer doesn't make sense considering the context. It is impossible for Uriah to have 320 toys in the first place since the problem mentions that his toys weigh 1/2 pound each.

There seems to be an inconsistency or an error in the problem, so no final answer can be provided. But based on the information given, it's clear that, unless the comic books actually weigh more than the stated 1/4 pound each, Uriah isn't going to be able to remove enough comic books to lighten his bag by 15 pounds without removing a large number of toys as well. {The final answer depends on the actual weight of the comic books.}</s>","30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5

Revenue from truck tire repairs on Thursday = 6 * $60 = $360

Car tires repaired on Thursday = 4
Fee for repairing each car tire = $40
Revenue from car tire repairs on Thursday = 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue from repair work on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

Step 2: Calculate the revenue earned by the mechanic for repairing car tires on Friday.
Car tires repaired on Friday = 12
Revenue from car tire repairs on Friday = 12 * $40 = $480

Step 3: Compare the revenue earned on the two days and find the difference.
Total revenue on Thursday = $520
Total revenue on Friday (only car tires) = $480
Difference in revenue between the two days = $520 - $480 = $40

Step 1: Subtract the number of lollipops Jean has eaten from the total number of lollipops she had.
Jean starts with 30 lollipops. She eats 2 lollipops, so:
Jean has eaten: 2 lollipops
Therefore, the number of lollipops remaining is: 30 lollipops - 2 lollipops = 28 lollipops

Step 2: Divide the number of remaining lollipops by the number of lollipops Jean wants to put in each bag to find out how many bags she can make.
Number of bags = Number of lollipops in each bag / Remaining lollipops
Number of bags = 2 lollipops / 1 bag = 2 lollipops / x
To find x (the number of lollipops in one bag), we set the equation to 2:
2 = 2 / x
x = 2
So, one bag contains 2 lollipops.

 step 3: Calculate the number of bags Jean can fill with the remaining lollipops
Number of bags = Remaining lollipops / Number of lollipops in each bag

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the weight of the truck and the driver when it is fully loaded with boxes.
The weight of one box is 15 pounds, so the weight of n boxes would be 15n pounds.
The combined weight of the truck and the driver is 3755 pounds.
Therefore, the weight of the empty truck is 3755 - 15n = 3740 - 15n pounds.

Step 2: Set up the equation to find the maximum number of boxes (n) that can be loaded on the truck.
5000 = 3740 + 15n

Step 3: Solve for n.
Subtract 3740 from both sides of the equation: 15n = 1600
Divide both sides by 15: n = 106.67
Since we cannot have a fraction of a box, we must round down to the nearest whole number.

Step 4: Evaluate the solution.
The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 106.

1. We know that there is 1 bad orange out of 25 oranges. So, the number of bad oranges is 1.

2. We also know that 20% of the oranges are unripe. Therefore, the number of unripe oranges is 0.2 * 25 = 5.

3. We have that 2 sour oranges are given in the basket.

4. Therefore, the number of good oranges is the total number of oranges minus the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges.

Good oranges = Total oranges - Bad oranges - Unripe oranges - Sour oranges

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the given information.
- Marcy has worked for the company for 40 years and receives an annual pension of $50,000.
- After 20 years of employment, she becomes entitled to a 5% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) on her pension annually.
- If she quits after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?

Step 2: Calculate the pension amount without COLA.
- Marcy has worked for 30 years, so her pension without any adjustments would be $50,000/year (given).

Step 3: Calculate the COLA amount.
- Marcy has worked for the company for 20 years before becoming entitled to the COLA, so no COLA adjustments have been applied to her pension yet.

Step 4: Apply the first COLA adjustment.
- Since Marcy has reached the 21st year of her retirement, she is entitled to a 5% COLA adjustment on her current pension of $50,000.
- First COLA adjustment = $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500
- Her pension after the first COLA adjustment = $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500/year

Step 5: Calculate the annual pension after 30 years of employment with COLA adjustments.
- Marcy has worked for 30 years and received a COLA adjustment in her 31st year. So, her pension for the 31st year is $52,500.
- To find her pension in the 32nd year, we'll apply the 5% COLA again: $52,500 * 1.05 = $55,125
- Similarly, for the 33rd year, the pension will be $57,837.50 (applying the 5% COLA to the previous year's pension)
- We need to find the pension amount for the 31st to 33rd years combined to determine the annual pension after 30 years.

Step 6: Find the average pension amount over 3 years.
- Pension amount for 31st year = $52,500
- Pension amount for 32nd year = $55,125
- Pension amount for 33rd year = $57,837.50
- Average pension amount over 3 years = ($52,500 + $55,125 + $57,837.50) / 3

Step 7: Find the final annual pension amount.
- The final annual pension amount after 30 years of employment is the average pension amount calculated in the previous step.

                 [/INST] To calculate the total amount paid by Aleena for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to find out how much she paid in each half of the year.

First, let's find out how much she paid for the first half of the year. We know that she pays $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in a half of a year, we can find the amount paid in the first half as follows:

Amount paid in first half = Monthly payment * Number of months
Amount paid in first half = $140/month * 6 months
Amount paid in first half = $840

Next, let's find out how much she paid for the second half of the year. We know that the company charged her 10% less than the amount for the first half, which means we need to find 90% of the amount for the first half.

Amount paid in second half = Amount paid in first half * 0.9
Amount paid in second half = $840 * 0.9
Amount paid in second half = $755.6 (rounded to the nearest cent)

Finally, to find the total amount paid by Aleena for the streaming service during the entire year, we just need to add the amounts paid in both halves:

Total amount paid = Amount paid in first half + Amount paid in second half
Total amount paid = $840 + $755.6
Total amount paid = $1595.6

{The final answer is $1595.6}.</s>","A year has twelve months, so a half of the year is 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 months,
For the first six months, the streaming service charged her a total of 6*140 = $<<6*140=840>>840
For the next half of the year, the streaming service company charged her 10/100*140 = $<<10/100*140=14>>14 less
She paid $140-$14 = $<<140-14=126>>126 each month for the remaining half of the year,
In total, she paid 126*6 = $<<126*6=756>>756 for the other half of the year for the streaming service.

                 [/INST] To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine how many gallons of gas are currently in her tank. We know that she has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank and needed to add 4 gallons to fill it up.

The calculation would be as follows:
Gallons in the tank = Gallons in the tank before refill + Gallons added
= 12 gallons (tank capacity) + 4 gallons (added during refill)
= 16 gallons

Next, we'll use the information from the car's owner's manual to find out how many miles per gallon (mpg) her car gets. The tank size isn't directly mentioned in the problem, so we assumed it was 12 gallons based on the information provided. If the tank size is different, we would adjust the calculaton accordingly.

We have that the car gets mpg = miles traveled / gallons of gas
= 100 miles / 12 gallons
= approximately 8.33 mpg

To find the total distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we multiply the number of gallons in the tank by the car's miles per gallon:

Total miles = Gallons in the tank * Miles per gallon
= 16 gallons * 8.33 mpg
= approximately 133.28 miles [The final answer is approximately 133.28 miles]</s>","To find miles per gallon divide 100 miles / 4 gallons = <<100/4=25>>25 miles per gallon

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one week.
- Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time.
- He spends half as long time reading, which is 2 hours * 0.5 = 1 hour.
- He does this routine 3 times a week.

So, in one week, Jim spends:
2 hours (TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours
in total on these activities.

Step 2: Calculate the number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks.

We know that Jim spends 3 hours (total) on TV and reading each week. Therefore, in 4 weeks, he spends:
3 hours/week * 4 weeks = 12 hours
in total on these activities.

To find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in each week, we can break it down as following:

TV: 2 hours/session * 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks = 24 hours
Reading: 1 hour/session * 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks = 12 hours

Therefore, {The final answer is: Jim spends 24 hours on TV and 12 hours on reading in 4 weeks (a total of 36 hours).}</s>","He reads for 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 hour a night

Step 2: We're told that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So we can calculate the number of rubies by subtracting 35 from the number of diamonds: number of rubies = number of diamonds - 35

Step 3: We're told that there are twice the number of emeralds as the number of rubies. So we can calculate the number of emeralds by multiplying the number of rubies by 2: number of emeralds = 2 * number of rubies

Step 4: We need to find the total number of gems in the chest. To do this, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together: total number of gems = number of diamonds + number of rubies + number of emeralds

Step 5: Let's calculate the number of rubies now: number of rubies = number of diamonds - 35

Step 6: Since the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, we can calculate the number of emeralds: number of emeralds = 2 * number of rubies

Step 7: Now we have the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. We can calculatethe total number of gems: total number of gems = 175 + (number of diamonds - 35) + 2 * (number of diamonds - 35)

Step 8: To solve for the number of diamonds, we need to isolate it in the equation from step 7. We can do this by subtracting 35 from the number of rubies, multiplying the result by 2 to get the number of emeralds, and then adding it all to the number of diamonds and the number of emeralds: number of diamonds = total number of gems - number of rubies - number of emeralds

Step 9: Substituting the expression for number of rubies and number of emeralds from steps 5 and 6 into the equation from step 8 and solving for number of diamonds, we get: number of diamonds = total number of gems - (number of diamonds - 35 - 2 * (number of diamonds - 35))

Step 10: Simplifying the equation from step 9, we get: 3 * number of diamonds = total number of gems + 110

Step 11: Solving for number of diamonds, we get: number of diamonds = (total number of gems + 110) / 3

Step 12: Substituting the value of total number of gems = 175 + number of rubies + 2 * number of rubies back into the equation from step 11 and solving for number of diamonds, we get: number of diamonds = (175 + 2 * (number of diamonds - 35) + 2 * (number of diamonds - 35)) / 3

Step 13: Simplifying the equation from step 12 and solving for number of diamonds, we get: number of diamonds = (175 + 2 * number of diamonds - 70) / 3

Step 14: Solving the quadratic equation from step 13, we get the following solutions: number of diamonds = 88.5 or number of diamonds = 187.5

Since it's not possible to have a fractional number of diamonds, we made an error somewhere in our calculations. We'll go back to step 12 and try to find the error.

Step 15: Upon further inspection of our calculations, we realized that in step 6, when we calculated the number of emeralds, we multiplied the number of rubies by 2 instead of subtracting 35 from the number of diamonds and then multiplying the result by 2. So the correct number of emeralds should have been: number of emeralds = 2 * (number of diamonds - 35)

Step 16: Now we can calculate the total number of gems again: total number of gems = 175 + number of rubies + 2 * number of rubies

Step 17: Calculating the number of","There were 175 - 35 = <<175-35=140>>140 rubies in the treasure chest.
There were 140 x 2 = <<140*2=280>>280 emeralds in the treasure chest.
So, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 175 + 140 + 280 = <<175+140+280=595>>595.

                 [/INST] To find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months with a 2% interest rate, follow these steps:

1. Find the total cost of the cell phones Shiela bought:
Cost of each cell phone = $150
Number of cell phones = 5
Total cost = Cost of each cell phone * Number of cell phones
Total cost = $150 * 5 = $750

2. Calculate the monthly payment without considering interest:
Since Shiela paid in installments, we need to find the monthly payment without considering interest. We can do this by dividing the total cost by the number of installments (3 months).
Monthly payment without interest = Total cost / Number of installments
Monthly payment without interest = $750 / 3
Monthly payment without interest = $250

3. Calculate the monthly payment with interest:
To calculate the monthly payment with interest, we need to consider the following formula:
M = P [ ( 1 + r/n ) ^ ( nt ) ]
Where,
M = Monthly payment
P = Principal amount (Total cost of cell phones)
r = Annual interest rate (2%)
n = Number of installments per year (not provided in the question, so let's assume it's monthly - 12 per year)
t = Time (number of months - 3)

First, let's calculate the monthly interest rate:
Monthly interest rate = Annual interest rate / 12
Monthly interest rate = 2% / 12 = 0.0016667 or 0.016384% (approximately)

Now, using the formula above, we can calculate the monthly payment with interest:
M = P [ ( 1 + r/n ) ^ ( nt ) ]
M = $750 [ ( 1 + 0.016384%/12 ) ^ ( 12 * 3 ) ]

Using a financial calculator or a spreadsheet software, we can calculate that:
Monthly payment with interest = $254.58

{The final answer is the monthly payment with interest: $254.58 for three months.}</s>","A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.
So, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.
The total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.
Thus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.

1. We know that each level of Luke's sandcastle has half the square footage of the level below it.
2. The top level of the sandcastle has a square footage of 16.
3. To find the square footage of the level below the top level (level 1), we need to find half of the square footage of the top level, which is 16 / 2 = 8.
4. Similarly, to find the square footage of level 2, we need to find half of the square footage of level 1, which is 8 / 2 = 4.
5. Following this pattern, we can find the square footage of level 3 by finding half of the square footage of level 2, which is 4 / 2 = 2.

{The final answer is:}
The average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-leveled sandcastle is the sum of the square footage of all levels divided by the total number of levels. So the average square footage is (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 7.5 square footage.</s>","Level 3 is 32 square feet because 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32

- The puppy needs 1 cup of food per day for the first 180 days.
- Therefore, the total amount of food needed for the first 180 days is 180 cups (1 cup/day * 180 days).

Step 2: Calculate the amount of dog food Cecilia needs to buy for the rest of the puppy's life.
- After the first 180 days, the puppy needs 2 cups of food per day.
- The total amount of food needed for the rest of the puppy's life can be calculated by finding out how many cups of food are needed each day after the first 180 days, and then multiplying that amount by the number of days in a year (365 days - 180 days).
- The puppy needs 2 cups of food per day after the first 180 days.
- The number of cups of food needed in a year after the first 180 days is (365 days - 180 days) * 2 cups/day = 546 cups.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bags of dog food Cecilia needs to buy for the first year.
- Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
- The total amount of dog food needed for the first year is the amount needed for the first 180 days plus the amount needed for the rest of the year.
- The total amount of dog food needed for the first year is 180 cups (first 180 days) + 546 cups (rest of the year) = 726 cups.
- The number of bags of dog food needed for the first year is 726 cups / 110 cups/bag = 6.6 bags. Since she can't buy a fraction of a bag, she'll need to buy 7 bags to have enough food for the first year.

                 [/INST] To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we first need to determine how many packages he can buy with each price option, and then calculate the cost for each option.

1. If Vincent buys flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50:
   Number of packages = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per package
   = 18 / 3
   = 6 packages
   Cost = Number of packages * Price per package
   = 6 * $2.50
   = $15

2. If Vincent buys flowers in packages of 2 for $1:
   Number of packages = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per package
   = 18 / 2
   = 9 packages
   Cost = Number of packages * Price per package
   = 9 * $1
   = $9

3. To determine the savings, subtract the cost of buying flowers at the worse price from the cost of buying them at the better price:
   Savings = Cost of flowers at better price - Cost of flowers at worse price
   = $15 - $9
   = $6

{The final answer is: Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.}</s>","Find how many packages of 3 would be needed which is 18 ÷ 3 = <<18/3=6>>6.

Step 1: Charlie had 10 stickers.
So, Charlie had a total of 10 stickers.

Step 2: He bought 21 stickers from the mall.
So, Charlie bought 21 new stickers from the mall.

Step 3: He got 23 stickers for his birthday.
So, Charlie received 23 more stickers as a gift for his birthday.

Step 4: He gave 9 stickers to his sister.
So, Charlie gave away 9 stickers to his sister.

Step 5: He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card.
So, Charlie used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of stickers Charlie has now.
First, let's find the total number of stickers Charlie had before purchasing and receiving any new ones: 10 (initial stickers) + 21 (bought from the mall) + 23 (received as a gift) = 54 stickers.
Then, from this total, subtract the number of stickers he gave to his sister and used for the greeting card: 54 (total stickers) - 9 (given to sister) - 28 (used for greeting card) = 17 stickers.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Alex weighs less than 4 times what Grace weighs. In mathematical terms, this can be written as Alex's weight (A) being less than 4 times Grace's weight (G): A < 4G

Step 2: Since Alex weighs less than Grace, we can find Alex's weight as a multiple of Grace's weight: A = kG, where k is a constant less than 4.

Step 3: Substitute the value of Grace's weight (125 pounds) into the equation: A = k * 125

Step 4: We know that A is less than 4 times Grace's weight, so k must be less than 4: k < 4.

Step 5: To find the values of k and the combined weight, we need more information. However, let's find the possible values of k and the combined weight based on different assumptions:

Assumption 1: If k is very close to 1, then Alex is nearly the same weight as Grace. In this case, A ≈ 125 * 1 = 125, and their combined weight would be 250 pounds.

Assumption 2: If k is smaller but still less than 4, then Alex would weigh significantly less than Grace. Let's choose a value that is less than 3. For example, if k = 1/2, then A = 125 * (1/2) = 62.5 pounds. In this case, their combined weight would be 187.5 pounds.

Step 6: The final answer is: Their combined weights can be 187.5 pounds or 250 pounds depending on the relationship between their weights. {The final answer is 187.5 pounds or 250 pounds}.</s>","Alex weighs 125*4-2 = <<125*4-2=498>>498.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the number of games won by the team as W, and the number of games lost as L. We know that that team played a total of 22 games, and they won 8 more games than they lost. So, we can set up the following equation:

W = L + 8

Step 2: Since the team lost fewer games than the number of games they won (L = W - 8), we want to find the value of W that satisfies our equation. In general, this is an equation of the form W = W + X, where X = -8 is the constant term.

Step 3: To find the value of W, we need to solve for W in terms of X. In this case, X = -8. Solving for W in the equation W = W + X (subtracting X from both sides), we get:

W = W + (-8)
W = W - 8

Step 4: Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get the equation W = W - 8. To find the value of W, we need to eliminate the W on the left side of the equation. We do this by adding 8 to both sides of the equation.

W + 8 = W
8 = W - W
W = 8 + W
W = 8 + W
Subtracting W from both sides, we get:

W = 8

Step 5: The final answer is {The team won 8 games}.</s>","Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.

1. The first alarm event: The alarm rang four times.
2. The second alarm event: The alarm rang three times, and it rang for the same length of time as the first alarm (since the problem states ""as long as the first time"" without explicitly stating that it rang for a different length of time). Therefore, the second alarm event contributed the same number of rings as the first alarm.
3. The third alarm event: The alarm rang for half the length of time as the second alarm. Since the second alarm rang for three rings (with each ring considered equal in length), then the third alarm rang for half that length, or one and a half times the length of an individual ring. As there were three rings during the second alarm event, the third alarm event contributed half that number, which is one and a half multiplied by three, or 1.5 * 3 = 4.5. However, since an alarm cannot ring for a fraction of a ring, we must round up to the nearest whole number.

Adding up the number of rings from each event: 4 (first event) + 3 (second event) + 5 (third event) = 12

However, since the third event contributed an extra ring due to rounding up, we must subtract 1 to correct our final calculation: The final answer is: The alarm rang 11 times in total.</s>","The second time Greg’s alarm went off, it rang three times as long as the first, so it rang 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 times the second time.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate Sylvie's current annual salary.
Sylvie has been with the company for 5 years. The company pays each employee $600 per month. So, Sylvie's current annual salary is:

Annual salary = Monthly salary * 12 months
= $600/month * 12 months
= $7200/year

Step 2: Calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service and one salary increase (5 + 3 = 8 years).
Sylvie will have worked for 8 years after the next three years. The company increases the salaries of employees by 10% every 5 years. Therefore, her salary will be increased by 10% after she completes her 5th year (at the end of year 6) and again after she completes her 10th year (at the end of year 11).

Let's denote Sylvie's salary after 6 years as S, and after 8 years (three more years) as F. We know that:
S = $7200 (given)
F = S + (S * 0.1 * 2) (two 10% increases)

Step 3: Calculate Sylvie's salary after 8 years.
We have the equation: F = S + (S * 0.1 * 2)
We also know that S = $7200. Substitute this value into the equation and solve for F:

F = $7200 + ($7200 * 0.1 * 2)
F = $7200 + ($7200 * 0.2)
F = $7200 + $1444
F = $8644

So, {The final answer is Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $8644.}</s>","In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.

                 [/INST] To find out how many copies Harald sold, we first need to determine how many copies Marilyn sold. Let's assume Marilyn's first record sold x copies and Harald's sold y copies.

From the problem statement, we know that Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so:

x = 10y

We also know that they sold a combined total of 88,000 copies. So:

x + y = 88,000

Now, we can solve for y by first substituting x with 10y in the equation:

10y + y = 88,000

Combining the terms on the left side:

11y = 88,000

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 11 to find the value of y:

y = 88,000 / 11

Now we have to handle the decimal part. Since the number of copies sold must be a whole number, we can't directly find the integer value of y from this result. Instead, we can assume that 88,000 is rounded up or down to the nearest multiple of 11 (99,000 or 87,000, respectively) in the real-world scenario.

Let's calculate both scenarios:

1. If the combined sales were rounded up to 99,000, that means Marilyn sold 10*y copies, so:
   10y = 99,000
   y = 9,900

2. If the combined sales were rounded down to 87,000, that means Marilyn sold 10*y copies, so:
   10y = 87,000
   y = 8,700

To determine which scenario is the correct one, we would require additional context. Since the problem statement doesn't provide enough information, we cannot definitively identify which number, 9,900 or 8,700, represents the number of copies Harald sold.

If more context is provided, indicate the correct value with {The final answer is [number]}.

For now, {The final answer is either 8,700 or 9,900, depending on the real-world scenario}.</s>","Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.

Combining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000
Dividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the amount of potato salad needed for adults and children.
An adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad. A child eats half as much as an adult, so a child eats 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

Step 2: Find the amount of potato salad needed for all the adults.
20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Step 3: Find the amount of potato salad needed for all the children.
5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Step 4: Find the total amount of potato salad needed for everyone.
200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs

                 [/INST] Let's break down the information given in the problem and solve for the age of Jackson step by step:

1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, Jackson is 5 years younger than Amy. Let's represent Amy's age as A and Jackson's age as J. Then, we have A = J +5.
2. Jackson is 2 years younger than Corey. But we don't have any information about Corey's age yet.
3. James is 10 years older than Jackson. So, James' age is represented as J+10.
4. James is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey's age is represented as J+(10+1) = J+11.
5. Now we have three equations representing the ages of Emily's three kids (A, James, and Jackson).
   A = J+5
   J+10 = Corey's age = J+11

6. To find the age of Jackson, we can first find the age of Corey and then use the information about Corey's and Jackson's ages to determine Jackson's age.
   Corey's age = J+11
   Subtracting Jackson's age from Corey's age, we find that Corey is J+11-J = 11 years older than Jackson.
7. Now we know that Jackson is 5 years younger than Amy, and Corey is 11 years older than Jackson. So, the age difference between Amy and Jackson is 11+5=16 years.
8. Finally, we know that Amy's age is A = J+5. So, to find Jackson's age, we need to find the value of J that satisfies the equation A = J+5 with an age difference of 16 years between Amy and Jackson.
9. Solving the equation A=J+5 for J, we have J = A-5. Substituting A with J+16 (since Amy is 16 years older than Jackson), we get J = (J+16)-5 = J+11.
10. However, since Jackson is actually 5 years younger than Amy, not 5 years older, the correct equation is J = (A-5). Substituting A with J+16, we get J = (J+16)-5 = J+11.
11. Solving for J, we find that J = -1 (which is not possible since ages can't be negative).
12. Realizing our mistake, we should have subtracted 5 from A instead of adding it during the substitution in the previous step. So, the correct equation is J = A-5.
13. Substituting A with J+16 in this correct equation, we have J = (J+16)-5 = J+11-5 = J+6.
14. Subtracting 6 from the equation J = A-5, we find that J = A-11.

So, the age of Jackson is {Jackson is A-11 years old}. Since no concrete value for A (Emily's age) is provided in the problem, finding the exact age of Jackson is not possible with the given information.</s>","James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = <<10+1=11>>11 years old
Amy is 2 years younger than Corey so is 11 - 2 = 9 years old
Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = <<9-5=4>>4 years old

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald: Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2 seconds.
2. Gerald improved his diet and became 10% faster: Gerald's new time = Gerald's original time x 1.10.
3. We are given Lee's new time, which is 38 seconds.
4. We need to find Gerald's new time with the improved diet.

First, we need to find the original time of Gerald:
Gerald's original time = Lee's time - 2 seconds
Gerald's original time = 38 seconds - 2 seconds = 36 seconds

Now we can calculate Gerald's new time:
Gerald's new time = Gerald's original time x 1.10
Gerald's new time = 36 seconds x 1.10
Gerald's new time = 40.08 seconds

Since the time given for Gerald's new time is not exactly 40.08 seconds, it's possible that the given information is rounded or approximate. In such cases, you could consider the answer as approximately 40.1 seconds.

{The final answer is Gerald's improved time is approximately 40.1 seconds.}</s>","If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles, then Gerald initially would run the 400-meter hurdles in 38+2=<<38+2=40>>40 seconds.
10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.
The improved diet reduced Gerald's race time to 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 seconds.

2. We also know that for every dog, there are two cats. So the number of cats C = 2 * D, where D is the number of dogs.
3. We're given that there are 60 dogs in the neighborhood, so D = 60.
4. Substituting D into the equation for C, we get C = 2 * 60 = 120.
5. We know that R = X - 12. Substituting R with the given value of 12, we get 12 = X - 12. Solving for X, we get X = 12 + 12 = 24.

3. Therefore, the number of girls is 200 - 80 = <math>120</math>.

1. We know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes.
2. When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half of their volume. This means that the sauce made from one can of tomatoes is half the volume of the original can, or 8 ounces (16 ounces * 0.5 = 8 ounces).
3. Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
4. To find out how many cans of tomatoes Freda used, we need to find out how many 8-ounce servings of sauce she made. We know that 1 can = 8 ounces of sauce, so:
   Number of cans = Total ounces of sauce / Ounces of sauce per can
   Number of cans = 32 ounces / 8 ounces
   Number of cans = 4
5. Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   Total tomatoes = Number of cans * Tomatoes per can
   Total tomatoes = 4 * 3
   Total tomatoes = 12

{The final answer is: Freda used 12 tomatoes.}</s>","Tomatoes lose half their volume when made into sauce, so Freda started with 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces of tomatoes.
At 16 ounces per can, she used 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 cans of tomatoes.
At 3 tomatoes a can, Freda used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 tomatoes.

1. We know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. The number of cars that drove through in this time is not given directly, but we do know that 5 cars took an exit and didn't have to drive through the jam.
3. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 30 (original number of cars) - 5 (cars that took an exit).
  {The number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 25.}

So, the final answer is that 25 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.</s>","The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.

                 [/INST] Step 1: John drinks a glass of water with each meal on weekdays. That's 3 glasses of water per meal, and there are 3 meals, so John drinks 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 glasses of water on weekdays.

Step 2: John drinks an additional glass of water before going to bed on weekdays. So that's 1 more glass, making it a total of 10 glasses of water that John drinks on weekdays.

Step 3: On weekends, instead of water, John drinks a soda with dinner. We know he still has a glass of water with breakfast and lunch, so that's 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 meals, that makes 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 glasses of water on weekends.

Step 4: Since John doesn't have the extra bedtime glass of water on weekends, the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekends is the same as the number of glasses he drinks during his meals: 2 (breakfast) + 2 (lunch) = <<2+2=4>>4 glasses of water.

Step 5: To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to find the sum of glasses he drinks during the weekdays and on the weekends:
- glasses on weekdays: 10

If : the city is 42 miles : across from the . oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how . many ! minutes , will , it ; take for the ; fog , bank to cover , the whole city?
                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover 3 miles. We're given that it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles.

Next, we can calculate how long it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city by finding out how many miles long the city is and dividing that length by the number of miles covered in 10 minutes, which is 3 miles.

Let's find out if our calculation matches the given information.

1. We know that it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles.
2. So, we need to determine how many minutes it takes to cover the entire city which is 42 miles long.
3. To do this, we divide the length of the city by the number of miles covered in 10 minutes:
    Number of minutes = Length of the city / Miles covered in 10 minutes
    = 42 miles / 3 miles/10 minutes
    = 14 minutes/mile
    = 14 miles/minute * 42 miles
    = 588 minutes

Therefore, it would take 588 minutes (or approximately 9.8 hours) for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

{The final answer is 9 hours and 52.8 minutes, or approximately 588 minutes.}</s>","The city will be covered in 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 intervals of 10 minutes.

                    question:
                    Poppy is solving a 1000-piece jigsaw ? puzzle. She places a quarter ! of the pieces on : the board, then her ! mom places . a third of the remaining ? pieces. How . many . jigsaw pieces ; are left ! to be placed?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the original number of jigsaw pieces as X.

1. Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board. So, the number of pieces she has placed is X/4.
2. The remaining pieces are a third of the original number. So, the number of pieces that are left are X - (X/4) - (X/3).

To find out the number of pieces that are left, we need to subtract the number of pieces Poppy placed from the original number of pieces:

{The final answer is X - (X/4) - (X/3)}

Alternatively, if we want to find the answer in terms of a simplified fraction, we can do the following calculations:

1. First, Poppy placed a quarter of the pieces: X/4.
2. Then, her mom placed a third of the remaining pieces: (3/4) * (X - X/4).

Simplifying this expression:

(3/4) * X * (4/3) * (3/4) = X * (1/2)^2

Therefore, the number of pieces left is X/2^2 = X/4.

Since we have already calculated this value, the final answer remains the same:

{The final answer is X - (X/4) - (X/3)} or {The final answer is X/2^2}

These two expressions represent the same value and describe the number of remaining pieces in the puzzle.</s>","Poppy has placed 1000 pieces / 4 = <<1000/4=250>>250 pieces.
This means there are 1000 – 250 = <<1000-250=750>>750 pieces remaining.
Her mom therefore places 750 / 3 = <<750/3=250>>250 pieces.
This leaves a total of 750 – 250 = <<750-250=500>>500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

                    question:
                    John has 3 boxes.  Each ; box is . 5 . inches by 6 ! inches by 4 inches.  ? The walls ? are 1 inch thick. :  What is ! the total inner volume , of all , 3 boxes?
                 [/INST] To find the total inner volume of all three boxes, follow these steps:

1. Find the volume of one box: Since the given dimensions are lengths x width x height, the formula for finding the volume of one box is:
   Volume of one box = length x width x height.

2. Plug in the given dimensions for one box (ignoring the wall thickness for now):
   length = 5.5 inches
   width = 6 inches
   height = 4 inches
   Volumn of one box = 5.5 inches * 6 inches * 4 inches.

3. Calculate the volume of one box:
   Volume of one box = 5.5 inches * 6 inches * 4 inches.
   Volume of one box = 162 cubic inches.

4. Find the volume of all three boxes:
   Volume of all three boxes = Number of boxes * Volume of one box.

5. Multiply the number of boxes (which is given as 3) by the volume of one box:
   Volume of all three boxes = 3 boxes * 162 cubic inches.

6. Calculate the total volume of all three boxes:
   Volume of all three boxes = 3 boxes * 162 cubic inches.
   Volume of all three boxes = 486 cubic inches.

7. Consider the wall thickness. Each box measures 5.5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches (ignoring the wall), but since there is a 1-inch thick wall on all six sides of the box, we must account for that. Each box therefore has dimensions 5 inches x 5 inches x 4 inches (length x width x height) for the inner volume and dimensions 5.5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches for the outer volume.

8. Find the volume of the inner space of each box considering the wall thickness:
   Volume of inner space = (Length - 2*Wall_thickness) x (Width - 2*Wall_thickness) x Height.

9. Calculate the volume of the inner space for one box:
   Volume of inner space = (5 inches - 2 inches) x (5 inches - 2 inches) x 4 inches.
   Volume of inner space = 8.5 inches x 8.5 inches x 4 inches.
   Volume of inner space = 288.5 cubic inches.

10. Find the total volume of the inner space for all three boxes:
   Total inner volume = Number of boxes x Volume of inner space.
   Total inner volume = 3 boxes x 288.5 cubic inches.

11. Multiply the number of boxes (which is given as 3) by the inner volume of one box:
    Total inner volume = 3 boxes x 288.5 cubic inches.
    Total inner volume = 865.5 cubic inches.

{The final answer is: The total inner volume of all three boxes is 865.5 cubic inches.}</s>","The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
So each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width
It also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height
Finally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth
So the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches
So in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches

                 [/INST] Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. We know that Frankie watches TV after finishing his homework every night.
2. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode each night. So, he watched a total of 1 hour × 2 nights = <<1*2=2>>2 hours of TV in those two days.
3. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. But we don't know exactly how many episodes he watched, so let's express this as an unknown variable x. Thus, he watched 30 minutes × x episodes on Wednesday.
4. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. So, he watched a total of 1 hour + 30 minutes = <<1+0.5=1.5>>1.5 hours of TV on Thursday.
5. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes. So, he watched a total of 1 hour × 2 episodes = <<1*2=2>>2 hours of TV on Friday.
6. The total number of hours Frankie watched TV during the week was 2 hours + (30 minutes × x episodes) + 1.5 hours + 2 hours = <<2+0.5*x+1.5+2=5.5+0.5*x>>5.5 + 0.5x hours.
7. We know that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. So, we can set up the equation 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 to find the value of x.
8. Subtracting 5.5 from both sides, we get 0.5x = 1.5.
9. Dividing both sides by 0.5, we get x = 3. So, Frankie watched 30-minute episodes a total of x times, which equals 3.

{The final answer is: Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.}</s>","Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.
After Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.
After Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.
After Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.
After Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.
Each 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.
Thus, W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We know that Henry baked 110 cookies this year and he wants to make 2 times as many as last year. So,
   Last year, Henry baked: 110 * (1/2) = 55 cookies.
2. Henry then realized he baked 15 cookies more than he intended. So,
   Cookies Henry actually baked = 110 + 15 = 125.
3. But Henry dropped 5 cookies, so the actual number of cookies he had after dropping them was: 125 - 5 = 120.
4. Now we want to find out how many cookies Henry baked last year. We know that he baked 55 cookies last year and he wanted to make 2 times as many this year. So,
   The number of cookies Henry baked last year = 55 * 2 = 110.

The final answer is: Henry baked 110 cookies last year.</s>","Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.
He had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.
Therefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.

Let's find the number of roll-ups for Beatrice:
Her fruit roll-ups were two roll-ups wide and 24 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups is:
2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls long = 48 roll-ups.

Next, let's find the number of roll-ups for Marcell:
His fruit roll-ups were 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups is:
3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls long = 42 roll-ups.

Now let's find the average number of roll-ups each person consumed:
The average number of roll-ups consumed = Total roll-ups eaten by both / Total number of people
The total number of roll-ups eaten is the sum of the roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice consumed.
 Total roll-ups eaten = Roll-ups eaten by Marcell + Roll-ups eaten by Beatrice
Total roll-ups eaten = 42 + 48 = 90 roll-ups

                 [/INST] To find out how much water the boat took on by the time Julia reached the shore, we first need to determine how many ten-foot intervals Julia rowed before reaching the shore. Let's call the number of ten-foot intervals x.

1. From the problem, we know that rowing twenty feet takes sixteen seconds, so the time it takes to row ten feet is:
   Time per ten feet = Time to row twenty feet / Number of ten-foot intervals in twenty feet
   Time per ten feet = 16 seconds / 2 = 8 seconds

2. We also know that the boat takes on two liters of water for every ten feet rowed. Therefore, the amount of water taken on for one ten-foot interval is:
   Water taken on per ten feet = 2 liters

3. To find out how many liters of water the boat took on before reaching the shore, we can multiply the water taken on per ten-foot interval by the number of such intervals:
   Total water taken on = Water taken on per ten feet × Number of ten-foot intervals

4. The problem states that the shore was 64 seconds away, so the number of ten-foot intervals (x) can be calculated as follows:
   x = Time to row to the shore (in ten-foot intervals) / Time per ten feet
   x = 64 seconds / 8 seconds/ten feet = 8 ten-foot intervals

5. Therefore, the total amount of water taken on by the time Julia reached shore is:
   Total water taken on = Water taken on per ten feet × Number of ten-foot intervals
   Total water taken on = 2 liters/ten feet × 8 ten-foot intervals
   Total water taken on = 16 liters

{The final answer is 16 liters}</s>","It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.
Thus, she had to row 20 * 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 feet back to shore.
In those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.
Thus, the boat had taken on 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

Step 2: In one lesson, each teacher cleans the whiteboard 3 times. Therefore, in a day, each teacher cleans the whiteboard 3 times for each of their 2 lessons. So, each teacher cleans the whiteboard 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 times per day.

Step 3: There are 4 teachers in the classroom, so the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day is 6 * 4 = <<6*4=24>>24.

{The final answer is 24}.</s>","In one day, there are a total of 4 teachers * 2 lessons each = <<4*2=8>>8 lessons.
The whiteboard is therefore cleaned 8 lessons * 3 cleans per lesson = <<8*3=24>>24 times.

- We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
- Brittany's phone can hold 6 times less photographs than Jamal's phone.

Photographs on Brittany's phone = Photographs on Jamal's phone / 6
= 1800 / 6

Step 2: Find out how many ducks can be seen in Brittany's photographs of ducks at the zoo.
- We know that each photograph on Brittany's phone can contain any number of ducks.
- The maximum number of photographs Brittany can take is 50 times more than the number of ducks in one of Jamal's photographs.

Number of ducks in one photograph = Unknown
Number of ducks in Brittany's photographs = (Number of ducks in one photograph) x (Number of photographs)

Maximum number of ducks in Brittany's photographs = (Number of ducks in one photograph) x (Number of photographs)

We don't have enough information to determine the number of ducks in one photograph, so we cannot find the maximum number of ducks in Brittany's photographs.

Step 3: Find out how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.
- We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

Number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo = Number of photographs / (Number of photographs per duck)

Since we don't have information about the number of photographs per duck, we cannot find the exact number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

                 [/INST] To find the number of teaspoons of salt and cups of water that correspond to 120 teaspoons of sugar, we first need to determine the amount of sugar in one ratio unit.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Since we know that 1 part of sugar is equal to 1 teaspoon, we can construct a proportion to determine how many teaspoons of sugar correspond to one part:

7 parts of sugar : 13 parts of water :: 1 teaspoon of sugar : x teaspoons of sugar

Solving for x, we get:

x = (13*1 teaspoon) / 1
x = 13 teaspoons

So one ratio unit (one part of sugar) is 13 teaspoons.

Now we can determine how many ratio units are present in 120 teaspoons of sugar:

Number of ratio units = Total teaspoons of sugar / Teaspoons per ratio unit
                         = 120 teaspoons / 13 teaspoons/ratio unit
                         = 9.23 ratio units

Since we can't have a fraction of a ratio unit, we'll need to round up to get the exact number of required units. In this case, we need 10 ratio units to account for the 120 teaspoons of sugar.

For one ratio unit, we know that 13 teaspoons of sugar are required, so for 10 ratio units, we'll need:

Salt (teaspoons) = 10 * 13 teaspoons/ratio unit
                    = 130 teaspoons

So, Katy used 130 teaspoons of salt while brewing her coffee.

{The final answer is 130 teaspoons of salt.}</s>","The total ratio representing the ingredients she used to make the coffee is 7+13 = <<7+13=20>>20

= 10 * 5
= 50 vehicles

Step 2: The total number of vehicles at the port on the second day is given as 30. Therefore, we need to find the number of containers that were brought in on the second day so that:

Number of containers * Number of vehicles per container = Total number of vehicles on the second day

Let x be the number of containers that were imported on the second day. Then:

x * 5 = 30

Step 3: To find the value of x, we divide the total number of vehicles on the second day by the number of vehicles per container:

x = Total number of vehicles on the second day / Number of vehicles per container

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago. Let x represent Lylah's salary four years ago. Then, Adrien's salary was 1.3x.
2. Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40%. Let A be Adrien's salary four years later. Then, A = 1.40x30%(Adrien's salary four years ago) = 1.4 * 1.3x = 1.52x.
3. Both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously. Let y represent Lylah's salary four years later. Then, y = x + Salary_increase_for_Lylah.

Now, we want to find the total salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

Since they both had the same percentage increase in their salaries, the ratio of their salaries remains the same: Adrien's salary = 1.52 * Lylah's salary.

We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. So, x = $40,000.

Now, we can find the value of y:

y = x + Salary_increase_for_Lylah

Since the problem doesn't give information about Lylah's salary increase, we cannot directly calculate it. The given information only allows us to find the ratio of their salaries.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The problem does not provide enough information to determine the total salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.}</s>","Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.
In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000
After receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200
In total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jennie has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps, and a pile of already stamped letters.
2. She has stamped one-third of the letters needing stamps, so there are now 30 letters already stamped.
3. We need to find out how many letters were already stamped when Jennie began.

First, let's find out how many letters Jennie has stamped so far:
- Jennie has stamped one-third of the letters needing stamps.
- Therefore, she has stamped 1/3 * 60 = <<1/3*60=20>>20 letters.

Second, let's find out how many letters were already stamped in the beginning:
- We know that there are now 30 letters already stamped.
- Jennie has stamped 20 letters.
- Therefore, there must have been 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 letters already stamped in the beginning.

{The final answer is: 10 letters were already stamped when Jennie began}.</s>","She stamped 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 letters.

                 [/INST] To find out how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought, we need to determine the total number of spoons she had after buying a new package and her husband giving her additional spoons, and subtracting the number of spoons she used.

1. Julia initially had no plastic spoons, and she used three of them to sample the stew. So, she had 3 spoons used.
2. Julia bought a new package of spoons and had an additional X spoons from her husband's purchase.
3. When setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Therefore, we can calculate the number of spoons in the package Julia bought by solving the following equation:

X = 12 + (number of spoons Julia bought) - 3

We know that when setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. So, the number of spoons Julia bought is:

number of spoons Julia bought = X - 12 + 3

number of spoons Julia bought = X - 9

Since we don't know the value of X (number of spoons her husband gave), we can't find the exact number of spoons in the package Julia bought. The equation above just shows us that the number of spoons in the package Julia bought is X less 9 spoons.

Without more information, we can't determine the exact number of spoons in the package Julia bought. Therefore, there isn't a final answer for this problem.</s>","The total number of spoons from Julia and her husband was 12+3=<<12+3=15>>15 spoons.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's find out how many fish sausages Dylan bought. We know that he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, and he bought 38 chicken sausages.

Let's represent the number of chicken sausages as x. Then the number of fish sausages is x + 6.

Step 2: We need to find the total number of sausages Dylan bought. The total number of sausages is the sum of the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages.

Total number of sausages = x + (x + 6)

Step 3: To find the value of x, we can use the information that Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages:

x = 38

Step 4: Substitute x = 38 into the equation for the total number of sausages:

Total number of sausages = 38 + (38 + 6)

Step 5: Simplify the equation:

Total number of sausages = 38 + 44 = 82

The final answer is: Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages.</s>","He bought 38 + 6 = <<38+6=44>>44 fish sausages.

                 [/INST] To find out how many friends Lily and Amy have together, we first need to find out how many friends each of them has. Let's denote:

- x as the number of friends Lily has

From the problem, we know that Amy has x + 20 friends.

The problem also states that Lily made 50% more friends than Amy, which can be written as x = 1.5 * Amy's number of friends.

We're given that Amy has x + 20 friends, so we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 1.5 * (x)

To solve this equation, we can first get rid of the x term on one side by subtracting x from both sides:

20 = 1.5 * x

Now, we can divide both sides by 1.5 to get x:

x = 20 / 1.5
x ≈ 13.33

Since we cannot have a fraction of a friend, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, giving x = 14 friends for Lily.

Next, we'll find the number of friends Amy has:

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 14 + 20
Amy's friends = 24

Finally, to find out how many friends they have together, we simply sum up their individual friend counts:

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 14 + 24
Total friends = 38

{The final answer is: Lily and Amy have 38 friends together}</s>","If Lily made 50 friends, Amy made 50+20 =<<50+20=70>>70 friends.

                 [/INST] To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we first need to find the costs of one watermelon and one orange in terms of the cost of one pepper.

1. The cost of a watermelon is three times the cost of each pepper: Watermelon cost = 3 * Pepper cost.
2. An orange costs 5 less than the cost of a watermelon: Orange cost = Watermelon cost - 5.

Let's denote P as the cost of each pepper.

1. Watermelon cost = 3P.
2. Orange cost = 3P - 5.

Now, let's find out how much Dillon will spend on each item:

1. Cost of 4 watermelons = 4 * 3P = 12P.
2. Cost of 20 peppers = 20 * P = 20P.
3. Cost of 10 oranges = 10 * (3P - 5) = 10(3P - 5).

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we just need to add up the costs of all the items:

Total amount = Cost of watermelons + Cost of peppers + Cost of oranges.
Total amount = 12P + 20P + 10(3P - 5).
Total amount = 12P + 20P + 10 * 3P - 10 * 5.
Total amount = 12P + 20P + 30P - 50.
Total amount = 42P - 50.

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. We know that Bobby has 5 fewer video games than Brian.
2. We're given that Brian has 20 video games.
3. Since Bobby has 5 fewer video games than Brian, we can find the number of video games Bobby has by subtracting 5 from Brian's number.

So,
Bobby's number of video games = Brian's number - 5

But we also know that the relationship between Brian's and Bobby's number of video games is such that Bobby has 3 times fewer video games than Brian. Let's use this information to double-check our answer.

Since Brian has 20 video games, we can write this relationship as:
Brian's number = 3 * Bobby's number

Now, we can solve for Bobby's number by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
Bobby's number = Brian's number / 3

We know that Brian has 20 video games, so we can calculate Bobby's number as follows:
Bobby's number = 20 / 3 = approximately 6.67

However, since we can't have a fractional number of video games, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. So,
Bobby has approximately 6 video games.

However, it seems there's a mistake in the problem as the information given doesn't seem to make sense. If Bobby has 5 fewer video games than Brian and Brian has 20 video games, then according to the information, Bobby should have 15 video games, rather than 6. This contradicts the statement that Bobby has 3 times fewer video games than Brian. Therefore, the problem might have an inconsistency, and the final answer might not be valid under these given conditions.

Revisiting our initial calculation, with the given information (which seems inconsistent), Bobby should have around 15 video games.

{The final answer, if we assume the inconsistency in the problem is a mistake, is approximately 15 video games for Bobby.}</s>","If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 video games
Brian has 15 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 15*3=45
We then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.

                 [/INST] To find out how many female Scottish unicorns there are, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one-third of all unicorns live there, we have:
number_of_unicorns_in_Scottish_Highlands = (total_number_of_unicorns) × (1/3)
number_of_unicorns_in_Scottish_Highlands = (27) × (1/3)
number_of_unicorns_in_Scottish_Highlands ≈ 9

2. To find out how many of these Scottish unicorns are females, we need to apply the given information that two-thirds of them are females:
number_of_female_unicorns_in_Scottish_Highlands = (number_of_unicorns_in_Scottish_Highlands) × (2/3)
number_of_female_unicorns_in_Scottish_Highlands ≈ 6

2. Next, the cost of the chips: 2 bags at $1.50 each = $3.00.
3. The cost of the cookies: 2 cookies at $1.00 each = $2.00.
4. Now, let's calculate the cost of the entire order without the delivery fee and tip: $15.00 for subs + $3.00 for chips + $2.00 for cookies = $20.00.
5. The delivery fee is 20% of the entire order: $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00.
6. Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the total cost of the delivery order is $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find out how long it takes Mark to complete 5 questions. Since he completes 5 questions per hour, it takes him 1 hour to complete 5 questions.

Step 2: Mark took a test with 75 questions yesterday. If he completes 5 questions per hour, then to complete all 75 questions, it would take him 15 hours (75 ÷ 5 = 15).

Step 3: In the problem, it states that Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test. This means he could only complete 40 questions in the given time (since 8 hours × 5 questions/hour = 40 questions). This indicates that he had 35 questions left incomplete.

Step 4: Now, we're asked to find the number of incomplete questions in the second test. Mark took a test of 100 questions today at the same rate of 5 questions per hour. If he had 6 hours to complete the second test, then he would have been able to complete 30 questions (6 hours × 5 questions/hour = 30 questions).

Step 5: Since there were 100 questions in total, and Mark completed 30 questions during the 6-hour time frame, there must have been 70 questions left incomplete (100 questions - 30 completed = 70 incomplete).

Let x be the number of blue gumballs.
Then, according to the problem, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs, so there are 4x + 22 pink gumballs.

II. Given that there are 12 blue gumballs, we can write the equation:

x (blue) = 12

III. To find the number of pink gumballs, substitute the value of x from equation (I) into the equation for the number of pink gumballs:

pink = 4x + 22

IV. Substitute x = 12 into the equation for pink:

                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many cars are semi-automatic. We know that there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. So the number of semi-automatic cars is:

Total cars = Automatic cars + Manual cars + Semi-automatic cars
20 = 12 + 4 + _______

Subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total, we get:

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 12 - 4
Semi-automatic cars = 4

So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars.

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

Percentage = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100%
Percentage = (4 / 20) * 100%
Percentage = 0.2 * 100%
Percentage = 20%

{The final answer is: 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.}</s>","12 + 4 = <<12+4=16>>16 cars are either automatic or manual.
So, 20 - 16 = <<20-16=4>>4 cars are semi-automatic.

Step 2: The problem states that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. Let's denote the number of worker bees as W and the number of baby bees as B.

Step 3: We also know that there are twice as many babies as queens, and the number of queens is not given directly. However, we can use the information provided to construct a relationship between the number of worker bees, baby bees, and queens.

Step 4: Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, we have B = 2Q. Substituting this into the equation W = 2B, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

Step 5: To find the number of worker bees, we just have to solve for W in terms of Q. W = 4Q.

Step 6: The problem does not provide the number of queens, so we cannot directly calculate the number of worker bees using the given information. To find the number of worker bees, we need to know either the number of queens or the number of baby bees.

Final answer: We cannot determine the number of worker bees without the number of queens or baby bees.</s>","Let x represent the number of queens

Let's start with the calculation of hours.

1. Jordan spends 2 hours playing video games every day. Therefore, in one week (7 days), he spends a total of 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours playing video games.

2. If Jordan goes to work instead of playing games, he can work for 14 hours in one week.

3. Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. So, to find his weekly earnings, we multiply the number of hours he works by the hourly wage.

Weekly earnings = Hours worked * Hourly wage

                 [/INST] To find the profit that Kim makes each week, we need to first calculate his total expenses and then subtract that from his total income:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of clients Kim has.
He currently has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so the total number of clients Kim has is 3 + 5 = 8.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of bleach for all clients.
Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach, so the total number of bottles needed is 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles.
The cost of each bottle of bleach is $2, so the total cost of bleach is 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of cloths for all clients.
Each client requires one pack of cloths, so the total number of packs needed is 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs.
The cost of each pack of cloths is $5, so the total cost of cloths is 8 packs * $5/pack = $40.

Step 4: Calculate Kim's total expenses.
His total expenses are the total cost of bleach and the total cost of cloths, which is $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Step 5: Calculate Kim's total income.
Kim's total income each week is $92.

Step 6: Find Kim's profit.
Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so Kim's profit each week is $92 (total income) - $72 (total expenses) = $20.

{The final answer is: Kim makes a profit of $20 each week.}</s>","Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.
Each week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.
Each week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.
The bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.
The packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.
His profit will therefore be $92 total income - $72 total expenses = $<<92-72=20>>20.

1. John has 10 hectares of pineapple field.
2. There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

Calculation of total pineapples:
Total pineapples = Hectares of land * Number of pineapples per hectare
Total pineapples = 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/ha
Total pineapples = 1000 pineapples

3. John can harvest every 3 months.

Calculation of number of harvests in a year:
We know that there are 4 seasons in a year. Since John harvests every 3 months, he can have harvests in 4 seasons:
Number of harvests in a year = Harvest interval in months / Number of seasons in a year * Number of harvests per season
Number of harvests in a year = 3 months / 4 seasons * 4 harvests
Number of harvests in a year = 3 harvests

4. To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we can multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests in a year:

Calculation of total number of pineapples harvested in a year:
Total number of pineapples harvested = Total pineapples * Number of harvests in a year
Total number of pineapples harvested = 1000 pineapples * 3 harvests
Total number of pineapples harvested = 3000 pineapples

Therefore, the second box has 500 * 3 = 1500 pieces. There is also a third box with 1/4 the number of pieces in the first box. So, there are 500/4 = 1250 pieces in the third box.

Next, we want to find out how many pieces are in total on the floor. We have 500 pieces from the first box, 1500 pieces from the second box, and 1250 pieces from the third box. So, the total number of pieces on the floor is 500 + 1500 + 1250 = 3250 pieces.

Since we're assuming Johnny picks up all the Legos, the number of pieces he picks up is equal to the total number of pieces on the floor, which is 3250.

{The final answer is: Johnny picks up 3250 pieces.}</s>","The first set had 500 pieces, and the second set had 3 times as many as the first set, so the second set has 500*3=<<500*3=1500>>1500 pieces

1. Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. She saw 1.5 times that number, or 45 bees (30 bees * 1.5), leave in the next 6 hours.
3. Every bee that hadn't returned from the previous 12 hours came back to the hive in the last 6 hours.

To find the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours, we need to find out how many bees left in the first 12 hours and then determine how many of those haven't returned yet.

The total number of bees that left the hive during the 12 hours was 30 + 45 = 75 bees.

Since some bees had already returned before the last 6 hours, let's find out how many bees had returned before this period.

First, let's calculate how many bees left during the first half of the day (6 hours):
During the first 6 hours, Debra saw 30 bees leave.
During the next 6 hours, she saw 45 bees leave.

However, since she saw two times as many bees leave during the second 6 hours as she did during the first 6 hours, the number of bees that left in the second 6 hours was actually 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Therefore, a total of 30 + 60 = 90 bees left the hive during the first 12 hours.

Since Debra saw 75 bees leave during this time, it means that 15 bees hadn't returned yet when she observed the last 6 hours.

Thus, the number of bees that returned to the hive during the last 6 hours was 75 (total number of bees that left) - 90 (number of bees that left or had returned during the first 12 hours) + 15 (number of bees that hadn't returned but did so before the last 6 hours) = 60 bees.

So, the final answer is that Debra observed 60 bees return to the hive during the last 6 hours of the day.</s>","Debra first sees 30 bees leave the hive, then sees 1/2 that many return, 30 x 1/2 = <<30*1/2=15>>15 bees that return and 15 bees that are still away from the hive.
Debra sees twice as many bees as first left the hive--which was 30--fly from the hive in the next 6 hours, 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bees that leave the hive.
In total, 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 bees left the hive.
There were 90 bees total that left the hive - 15 bees that already returned = <<90-15=75>>75 bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how long it takes Steve and Tim to travel their respective distances using their modes of transportation.

1. Steve rides his bike: Distance = 3 miles, Speed = 440 feet/minute
To find the time it takes Steve to cover 3 miles, we first need to convert the distance from miles to feet: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 16,420 feet.

Next, we'll divide the total distance by Steve's speed: Time = Distance / Speed = 16,420 feet / 440 feet/minute = 37.32 minutes (approximately).

2. Tim rides his skateboard: Distance = 2 miles, Speed = 264 feet/minute
Time = Distance / Speed = 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile / 264 feet/minute ≈ 11.18 minutes.

Since Steve takes longer than Tim to reach home, Steve will be the winner. Therefore, the question asks for the time Tim takes waiting at his house before Steve finishes.

Since Steve takes ≈37.32 minutes and Tim takes ≈11.18 minutes, the difference between their finishing times is ∼26.14 minutes.

The final answer is {Tim will wait approximately 26.14 minutes before Steve finishes the race}.</s>","Steve has to travel 3 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<3*5280=15840>>15840 feet to get home.
It will take Steve 15840 feet / (440 feet/minute) = <<15840/(440)=36>>36 minutes to get home.
Tim has to travel 2 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<2*5280=10560>>10560 feet to get home.
It will take Tim 10560 feet / (264 feet/minute) = <<10560/264=40>>40 minutes to get home.
Steve will finish the race in 40 minutes - 36 minutes = <<40-36=4>>4 minutes less time than Tim.

1. We know that each tire inflated costs 25 cents.
2. On the first day, 5 people came with bicycles, and each bike has two tires. So, 5 people * 2 tires/bike * 2 tires/set * 25 cents/tire = $5.00.
3. Three people came with tricycles, and since a tricycle has three tires, it will cost them $3.00 each ($3 * 3 people).
4. One person came with a unicycle, so it costs 25 cents for the one tire on the unicycle.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cookies by multiplying the number of cookies Carl bought by the price of each cookie.
Total cost = Number of cookies * Price per cookie
Total cost = 60 * $0.10
Total cost = $6

Step 3: Subtract the total cost of the cookies from the amount Carl paid with his $10 bill to find out how much change he received.

                 [/INST] To find the number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it, we need to find out how many fries were left after each animal or event took its share. Here's a step-by-step solution:

Step 1: The number of french fries Dave ate before the seagull stole the pack was 14. So, the number of fries in the pack at that moment was 14 + the initial number of fries Dave bought.
{Let X = initial number of fries Dave bought}
X = 14 + X
X = 14 + X
X - X = 14
X = 14
So, when the seagull stole the pack, there were 14 + 14 = 28 french fries in total.

Step 2: The seagull ate half of the fries, so it consumed 28/2 = 14 french fries. This leaves us with 28 - 14 = 14 french fries.

Step 3: Three pigeons each ate three fries. So, they consumed 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 fries. This leaves us with 14 - 27 = -13 fries. However, the number of french fries cannot be negative. So, an error must have occurred in the problem. In this case, it is likely that the number of fries each pigeon ate was mentioned incorrectly.

Step 4: Assuming that the number of fries each pigeon ate was 1 or 2 instead of 3, the number of fries remaining would be 14 - 1*2 - 1*2 - 1*2 = 11.

Step 5: A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. So, it took away 2/3 * 11 = 7 french fries. This leaves us with 11 - 7 = 4 french fries.

Step 6: Finally, an ant carried off the last french fry, leaving 4 - 1 = 3 french fries behind.

However, since Dave originally bought X fries and we only know that 3 were left after the ants took the last one, it is impossible to determine the exact number of fries Dave bought based on the provided information.

{The final answer is: We cannot find the initial number of french fries Dave bought from the given information}</s>","Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.
The 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.
The ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.
The raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.
Thus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.

- In one semester, there are 16 weeks, so Kimo spends 15 classes/week × 16 weeks = 240 hours on Mon, Wed, and Fri.

Step 2: Calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on classes per week on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
- He has 2 classes each day, and each class lasts 2 hours.
- Therefore, he spends 2 classes × 2 hours/class = 4 hours/day on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
- Since there are 5 weeks of classes per month and we have 2 such days per week, there are 2 × 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 classes per month on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
- In one semester, there are 16 weeks, so Kimo spends 10 classes/week × 16 weeks = 160 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Step 3: Add the hours spent on classes every day of the week to find the total hours spent on classes per semester.
- Weekly hours = 3 hours/day (Mon, Wed, Fri) + 4 hours/day (Tue, Thu) = 7 hours/day

Total bananas needed in one month = Monkeys + Gorillas + Baboons
Total bananas needed in one month = 200 + 400 + 100
Total bananas needed in one month = 700 bananas

To find out how many bananas are needed for 2 months, we multiply the number of bananas needed in one month by 2:

Total bananas needed in 2 months = Total bananas needed in one month * 2

1. Raphael bought 4 pens, each costing $1.5.
2. He bought 2 notebooks, each costing $4.
3. He purchased a ream of bond paper costing $20.

Let's calculate the cost of each item and add them up:

Cost of pens = Number of pens * Cost of each pen

1. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, x clownfish.
2. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 fewer = 5 x starfish. Also, Locsin caught 3 fewer seahorses than Anakin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 fewer = 3 seahorses. And Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.
3. To find the number of clownfish x, let's use the information given that Locsin had 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so x = Anakin's clownfish + 2.

Now let's put all the pieces together and find out how many fish they caught in total:

1. Anakin caught 10 + 6 + (Anakin's clownfish) = 16 + Anakin's clownfish.
2. Locsin caught 5*(1 + 1) + 3 + 5 = 11 + Anakin's clownfish (since x = Anakin's clownfish + 2).

Therefore, their total catch is: The final answer is: 16 + Anakin's clownfish + 11 = 27 + Anakin's clownfish. We still don't have an exact value for Anakin's clownfish, but once we have that, we can solve for the total number of fish they caught.</s>","Locsin caught 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 starfishes.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the cost of a bag of marbles after every two months by applying a 20% increase to the original price.

Cost after 2 months = Original price * (1 + 0.2)
Cost after 2 months = $20 * 1.2
Cost after 2 months = $24

Step 2: Apply this percentage increase every two months for a total of 18 increases (since there are 18 two-month intervals in 36 months).

Cost after 36 months = Original price * (1 + 0.2) ^ 18

Step 3: Calculate the final cost by using the given formula and the value of 20% as a decimal (0.2).

Cost after 36 months = $20 * (1 + 0.2) ^ 18

Step 4: Perform the calculation.

5 red cars => Worth of red cars = Number of red cars * Cost of one red car
Worth of red cars = 5 * $4
Worth of red cars = $20

Next, let's find the worth of action figures:
3 action figures => Worth of action figures = Number of action figures * Cost of one action figure
Worth of action figures = 3 * $5
Worth of action figures = $15

Lastly, let's find the worth of the doll:
Cost of doll = Cost of 3 action figures + Cost of one red car
Cost of doll = $15 + $4
Cost of doll = $19

Now, we can find the total worth of all the toys:

1. To make one Spanish flan, Sandra needs 3 : eggs. {We are given this information in the question}.

2. When Sandra's neighbor gives her eggs for babysitting, they give her ! a , basket of 9 : eggs. We can calculate the number of eggs given by finding the product of the number of baskets and the number of eggs in each basket:

   eggs_given = baskets * eggs_per_basket
   = 9 * 9
   = 81 eggs

3. We know that Sandra needs 3 eggs for each Spanish flan, so we can calculate the number of Spanish flans she can make with the eggs given per session:

   number_of_flans = eggs_given / eggs_per_flan
   = 81 / 3
   = 27 flans

   Since she can only make 15 flans for the school fundraiser, we need to find out how many babysitting sessions are required to produce 15 flans.

According to the problem, in two years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, we have:

X + 2(X) + 2 = 28
3X + 2 = 28
3X = 26
X = 26/3

Since Brooke's age is not a fraction, we need to find the integer closest to 26/3. The next highest integer is 9, and subtracting 2, we get:

X = 9

Now, we can find Seth's age:

Seth's age = 2 * Brooke's age = 2 * 9 = 18

Therefore, the answer is: {Seth is currently 18 years old}.</s>","To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.

Step 2: Now, let's find out the cost of the pants. We know that the cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. So, the cost of the pants is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Step 3: Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is the cost of the hat + the cost of the jacket + the cost of the pants. So, the total cost of each uniform is $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

1. Spiders have 8 legs each, and there are 80 of them. So the number of legs from spiders is: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs.
2. Insects have 6 legs each, and there are 90 of them. So the number of legs from insects is: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs.
3. Rare mutant invertebrates have 10 legs each, and there are 3 of them. So the number of legs from the rare mutant invertebrates is: 3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs.
4. To find the total number of legs that Jake sees, add the number of legs from each type of creature: 640 legs (spiders) + 540 legs (insects) + 30 legs (rare mutant invertebrates)

Four ; is ? the same age ; as Sally ? Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo ! is 8 years ? old, ; what's the total age of the four ; birds?
                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We have four birds: Sally Two, Granny Red, Sally Four, and Sally Thirtytwo.
2. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Granny Red is three years younger than Sally Two. We can write this as Granny Red = Sally Two - 3.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Sally Four is half as old as Granny Red. We can write this as Sally Four = Granny Red / 2.
4. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo. So, Sally Thirtytwo = Sally Four.
5. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. Substituting Sally Four from the earlier equation (Sally Four = Granny Red / 2), we get Granny Red = 2 * Sally Four = 2 * (Sally Thirtytwo). (Replacing Sally Four with Sally Thirtytwo)
6. Substituting Granny Red's age in the first equation (Sally Two = Granny Red + 3), we get Sally Two = Granny Red + 3 = (2 * Sally Thirtytwo) + 3.
7. Now we need to find the total age of the four birds. Since we already have the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, and Sally Thirtytwo, we just need to find the age of Sally Four:
   - From Sally Four = Granny Red / 2, we have Granny Red = 2 * Sally Four. Substituting this in Sally Two = Granny Red + 3 gives us Sally Two = 2 * Sally Four + 3.
   - We are given that Sally Three2 = 8. Comparing this with Sally Four = Granny Red / 2, we can find that Granny Red = 4 * Sally Four. Substituting Granny Red = 4 * Sally Four in the equation Sally Two = 2 * Sally Four + 3, we find Sally Two = 6 * Sally Four + 3.

The total age of the four birds is the sum of the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, Sally Four, and Sally Thirtytwo.
Substituting Sally Two = 6 * Sally Four + 3, we have:

Total Age = (6 * Sally Four + 3) + (2 * Sally Four) + Sally Four + Sally Thirtytwo
Total Age = 10 * Sally Four + 3 + Sally Thirtytwo

Since Sally Four = Sally Thirtytwo, we can write the total age as:
Total Age = 10 * Sally Thirtytwo + 3

Final answer: {The total age of the four birds is 10 * Sally Thirtytwo + 3}. Note that we need the actual value of Sally Thirtytwo to find the exact age of the birds.</s>","If Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, same as Sally four, their total age 8+8 = <<8+8=16>>16 years.
Granny red is two times as old as Sally four, meaning Granny red is 2*8 = <<2*8=16>>16 years old.
Sally Thirtytwo, Sally four, and Sally red are 16+16 = <<32=32>>32 years old.
Sally two is three years older than Granny red, meaning Sally two is 16+3= <<16+3=19>>19 years old.
The four birds have a total age of 32+19 = <<32+19=51>>51 years old.

                 [/INST] To calculate how much Jessica needs to pay each month to meet her debt obligations and pay 50% more than the minimums, we first need to find out what the minimum payments are for each debt type. Then we'll calculate how much she needs to pay on each debt type to pay 50% more than the minimum:

1. Student loans minimum payment: $300/month
2. Credit card minimum payment: $200/month
3. Mortgage minimum payment: $500/month

To find out how much more Jessica needs to pay on each debt type to pay 50% more than the minimum, we'll calculate that amount for each debt type:

1. Student loans: $300/month * 1.5 = $450/month
2. Credit card: $200/month * 1.5 = $300/month
3. Mortgage: $500/month * 1.5 = $750/month

Now that we know Jessica needs to pay $450/month for her student loans, $300/month for her credit card, and $750/month for her mortgage, we can calculate how much she needs to pay in a year.

There are 12 months in a year, so the total amount Jessica needs to pay annually is:

$450/month (student loans) + $300/month (credit card) + $750/month (mortgage)

Total Annual Payment = $1,500/month * 12 months = $18,000/year

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes Billy to prep all the potatoes, we first need to find out how long it takes him to peel and cut one potato. Then we'll multiply that time by the number of potatoes he has to prepare.

1. Time taken to peel one potato: 1 minute and a half = 1.5 minutes
2. Time taken to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Since Billy spends 1.5 minutes on peeling each potato and only 5 seconds on cutting, the total time spent on one potato is 1.5 + 5 = <\b>2.5 minutes<\b>.

3. Now, Billy has 60 potatoes to prepare, so the total time spent on prepping all the potatoes would be 2.5 minutes * 60 = <b>150 minutes</b>.

Converting 150 minutes to hours, we get 150 / 60 = <b>2.5 hours</b>.

Therefore, the answer is:
{The final answer is: It will take Billy 2.5 hours to finish prepping the potatoes.}</s>","There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.
Billy only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.
So it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.

                 [/INST] To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we first need to determine how many gallons of lemonade they sold and how much profit they made per gallon.

1. First, let's calculate how many glasses of lemonade they sold with 20 glasses per gallon:
   Glasses sold = Gallons sold × Glasses per gallon
   = Unknown × 20

2. Next, we'll determine their profit per gallon by subtracting the cost of lemons, sugar, and the selling price of each glass from their total profit:
   Profit per gallon = Total profit - (Lemons cost per gallon + Sugar cost per gallon + Glass selling price per gallon × Glasses per gallon)
   = $25 - (3$/gal × L + 2$/gal × L + 0.5$/glass × 20)

3. Since we don't have the exact values for the number of gallons sold (L) and the cost of lemons per gallon (3$/gal), we can set up an equation to solve for the unknowns:
   25 = 3L + 2L + 0.5(20L)

4. Simplify the equation:
   25 = 3L + 2L + 10L
   25 = 15L
    L = 1.67 gallons (approximately, since we cannot have a fraction of a gallon sold)

5. Now that we have the number of gallons sold, let's calculate how much they spent on lemons per gallon:
   Lemons cost per gallon = Cost per gallon for lemons
   = $3

6. To find out how much they spent on lemons for the sold gallons, multiply the cost per gallon for lemons by the number of gallons sold:
   Total lemons cost = Lemons cost per gallon × Gallons sold
   = $3/gal × 1.67 gallons ≈ $5.01

{The final answer is: Juan and Carlos spent approximately $5.01 on lemons.}</s>","Each gallon sells for a total of $10 because 20 x .5 = <<20*.5=10>>10

2. Among the Chinese racers, there were 60 boys on the Chinese team.
3. To find out how many girls were on the Chinese team, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese racers and find the difference.

                 [/INST] To find out how many red roses Fred needs to deliver by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business, we need to determine the number of red roses that Sandra ordered in the first place and then find the difference between the ordered and delivered quantities to figure out how many more red roses need to be delivered.

1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let x be the number of white carnations. Then, the number of red roses is 4x.
2. Sandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. So, the number of white carnations is x, and the number of calla lilies is 5x.
3. However, the problem statement does not provide the actual number of white carnations or red roses that were delivered. Therefore, we cannot determine the difference between the ordered and delivered quantities directly from the information given.

Unfortunately, without knowing the exact number of white carnations that Sandra ordered and the number that were delivered, we cannot calculate the number of red roses Fred needs to deliver by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: We cannot determine the number of red roses Fred needs to deliver by 5 pm based on the given information.</s>","Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies / 5 = <<200/5=40>>40 white carnations.

                 [/INST] Let's define Mark's current age as M and Jan's current age as J. We know that:

1. Jan is two years older than Mark, so J = M + 2.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. Let's find Jan's age two years ago, which is J - 2: J - 2 = M - 5.
3. We're also given that Jan is currently 30 years old, so J = 30.

Now we have two equations with two variables:

1. J = M + 2
2. J - 2 = M - 5

Subtracting 2 from the first equation, we get M = J - 2.
Substituting J = 30 into this equation, we get M = 30 - 2 = 28.

So Mark is 28 years old, and since Jan is two years older than Mark, Jean's age is J = 30 (Jan's age) + 2 = 32 years.

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the total time for each team:

1. For the well-rounded team, each member runs in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for the team is: 55 seconds * 4 members = 220 seconds.
2. For the less well-rounded team:
   - The first runner takes 60 seconds to complete the 400-meter leg.
   - The second runner takes 60 + 3 seconds = 63 seconds.
   - The third runner takes 60 + 3 * 2 = 66 seconds.
   - The fourth runner takes 60 + 3 * 3 = 69 seconds.
   The total time for the less well-rounded team is: 60 seconds (first runner) + 63 seconds (second runner) + 66 seconds (third runner) + 69 seconds (fourth runner) = 238 seconds.
3. To find the difference in time, subtract the time for the less well-rounded team from the time for the well-rounded team: 220 seconds (well-rounded) - 238 seconds (less well-rounded) = -18 seconds.
   However, since a negative value means the less well-rounded team wins (as they completed the race earlier), the calculation result is incorrect. To get a positive value, we need to change the sign.

The final answer is: The less well-rounded team wins by 18 seconds.
{The final answer is: The less well-rounded team wins by 18 seconds.}</s>","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

                 [/INST] To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 in one roll and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. Then we'll compare these probabilities.

1. Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 in one roll: There are 4 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6), so the probability is:
   P(rolling a number greater than 3) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes 
   = 3 / 6 = 1/2 = 0.5

2. Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: The probability of rolling an even number in one roll is 1/2 because there are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6). So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
   P(rolling two even numbers in a row) = P(rolling an even number) * P(rolling an even number | rolling an even number once)
   
   The second term is the conditional probability, which represents the probability of rolling an even number after rolling an even number once. Since we're rolling the die independently each time, this is just the probability of rolling an even number again, which is also 1/2. So, the calculation is:
   
   = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 = 0.25

3. Comparing the probabilities: To determine which event is more likely, we compare their probabilities:
   
   P(rolling a number greater than 3) = 0.5 > P(rolling two even numbers in a row) = 0.25

So, it's more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than rolling two even numbers in a row.

{The final answer is: Jerry is more likely to roll a number greater than 3 in one roll than rolling two even numbers in a row.}</s>","There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

Step 2: We know that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, so we have the relationship J = 0.5 * M.

Step 3: We also know that her mother picked 20 apples, so we have the relationship M = 20.

Step 4: Substituting M = 20 into the relationship J = 0.5 * M, we get J = 0.5 * 20 = 10.

Thus, Jenna picked 10 apples and her mother picked 20 apples in total.

                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many pieces of straw were given to rats and hamsters. Let's call the number of rats in each cage for the rat group x. Since there are 3 cages with equal number of rats, the total number of rats is 3x.

Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of pieces of straw given to rats is 6x(3x) = 18x^2.

Now, let's find out how many pieces of straw were given to hamsters. There are 10 cages with 1 hamster each, so the total number of hamsters is 10. Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of pieces of straw given to hamsters is 5(10) = 50.

We know that a total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among small rodents, so we can set up the following equation:

18x^2 (rats) + 50 (hamsters) = 160 (total)

Solving this equation will give us the number of rats in each cage:

18x^2 + 50 = 160
18x^2 = 110
x^2 = 6.11 (approximately)
x = √6.11 (approximately)
x ≈ 2.45

Since the number of rats in a cage must be a whole number, there is a mistake in the given problem or the initial values are not valid. {The final answer is: The given problem has an error and cannot be solved as is.}</s>","In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

The trader bought a certain number of bags at a rate of $20 per bag. His total cost for buying the bags was $400 more than the cost of buying the bags alone.

Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought as x. We have:
Cost of buying bags = 20$/bag × number of bags bought (x)
Cost of transporting bags = 2$/bag × number of bags transported (x)
Total cost = Cost of buying bags + Cost of transporting bags
Total cost = 20x + 2x = 22x

We know that the total cost of buying and transporting the bags was $400, so:

22x = $400
x = $400 / $22
x = 181.82 bags

Since the trader cannot buy a fraction of a bag, he must have bought 181 bags.

Step 2: Find the number of bags the trader sold.
The trader sold each bag at a rate of $30. Let's denote the number of bags he sold as y.

Profit = Selling price × Number of bags sold
Profit = $30/bag × y

We know that the profit was $400, so:

$30/bag × y = $400
y = $400 / $30
y ≈ 133.33 bags

Since the trader cannot sell a fraction of a bag, he must have sold 133 bags.

Therefore, the difference between the number of bags the trader bought and the number of bags he sold is the number of bags he had in his inventory.

Number of bags in inventory = x - y
Number of bags in inventory = 181 - 133

The three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets. The cost of one ticket is $20.25 / 3 = $6.75.

Step 2: calculate the total amount spent on food.
It is given that they spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets. Thus, the total amount spent on food is $20.25 / 3 - $4.50 / 3 = $13.85 / 3 = $4.62 (approximately).

Step 3: calculate the total amount spent on rides.
They went on 2 rides, each of which cost $33. The total amount spent on rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

- After 10 years, 30% of his trees have died. So, the number of trees that have died is 50 x 0.3 = <<50*0.3=15>>15 trees.

Step 3: Calculate the number of trees Tom has left.
- The number of trees Tom has planted and chopped down in 10 years is 100 (Step 1), and the number of trees that have died is 15 (Step 2).
- Therefore, the number of trees Tom has left is 100 + 100 (new trees from planting) - 20 (trees chopped down) - 15 (trees that died) = <<100+100-20-15=185>>185 trees.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. On Friday morning, 18 pink plastic flamingos were placed in Sue's front yard.
2. On Saturday morning, one third of the flamingos were taken away, and then 18 new pink plastic flamingos were added.

So let's find out how many pink flamingos there are in total after these two events:

1. Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.
2. One third of these were taken away, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So 18 - 6 = 12 flamingos were left after this.
3. Then, 18 new pink flamingos were added. So in total, there are now 12 (left) + 18 (new) = <ins>30</ins> pink flamingos in Sue's front yard.

To find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos, we need to determine how many white flamingos there are. But the text does not provide information about the number of white flamingos. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of pink plastic flamingos that are out compared to white ones.

The final answer is: We cannot determine the difference between the number of pink and white plastic flamingos based on the given information.</s>","On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.
This left 18 pink - 6 = <<18-6=12>>12 pink flamingos.
On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, for a total of 12 + 18 = <<12+18=30>>30 pink flamingos on the front lawn.
Altogether, there were 30 pink and 6 white flamingos on the lawn, so there were 30 pink - 6 white =<<30-6=24>>24 more pink flamingos.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many crayons Violetta wants to buy.
Violetta wants to buy new crayons in 5 different colors.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the crayons Violetta intends to buy.
The cost of one crayon is $2, and Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors.
Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 * $2
Total cost = $10

Step 3: Subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money Violetta has prepared for the purchase.
Change = Amount prepared - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10

{The final answer is: Change = $10}
However, I believe there was a mistake in the question as the amount of money Violetta had prepared was $20 and the total cost of the crayons was only $10, so she wouldn't need change, but rather she would spend $10. Therefore, the final answer doesn't really make sense in the context of the question. I suggest re-checking the values given in the question.</s>","Violetta is going to pay 5 * 2 = $<<5*2=10>>10 for the crayons she wants.

- A pen costs $x
- A pencil costs $1.20
- An eraser costs $0.30
- According to the problem, the cost of a pen is the same as the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined.
- So, $x = $1.20 + $0.30
- Solving the equation: $x = $1.50

Step 2: Find the cost of 8 pens.
- One pen costs $1.50
- Eight pens cost $8 * $1.50
- Therefore, 8 pens cost $12.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of pounds of carrots each restaurant will receive.
since each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, we can find the total number of pounds of carrots required for all 40 restaurants by multiplying the number of restaurants by the number of pounds of carrots each restaurant will receive.

Total carrots required = Restaurants * Carrots per restaurant
Total carrots required = 40 * 2

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pounds of carrots needed.
Total carrots required = 80 pounds

Step 3: Find the number of pounds of carrots not distributed.
Since we started with 200 pounds of carrots, and we distributed 80 pounds, we can find the number of pounds of carrots not distributed by subtracting the amount used from the total amount.

Pounds not distributed = Total carrots * Starting Weight - Total carrots used
Pounds not distributed = 200 * 1 - 80

Step 4: Write the final answer.

Step 2: We know that there are 8417 men and 9092 women in Soda. So, let's find the number of inhabitants that are not children by adding the number of men and women.

Number of adults = Number of men + Number of women
Number of adults = 8417 + 9092
Number of adults = 17509

Step 3: Now we have the number of adults, and we know that the total population is 23786. Therefore, we can find the number of children by subtracting the number of adults from the total population.

Number of children = Total population - Number of adults
Number of children = 23786 - 17509

2. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, so she collected 20 - 20 = 0 new cards in the second month.
3. In the third month, she collected twice the number of cards she collected in the first and second months. So she collected 2 * (20 + 0) = 2 * 20 = 40 new cards in the third month.
4. In total, Elaine has 20 (from the first month) + 0 (from the second month) + 40 (from the third month) = 60 Pokemon cards.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week for both publishers.

Step 2: Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A as ""x"" and the number of sentences he edits for Publisher B as ""y"".

Step 3: We know that x + y = 1000 (since the total number of sentences edited each week is 1000).

Step 4: We're given that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so Mark makes 5x cents editing for Publisher A.

Step 5: We're also given that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Mark makes 10 cents per sentence when editing for Publisher B. Therefore, Mark makes 10y cents when editing for Publisher B.

Step 6: To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we need to find the sum of the amounts he makes from both publishers:

Total amount = 5x + 10y

Step 7: Substituting ""x = 1000 - y"" (from Step 3) into the equation for total amount:

Total amount = 5(1000 - y) + 10y

Step 8: Simplifying the equation:

Total amount = 5000 - 5y + 10y
Total amount = 5000 + 5y

Step 9: Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact values of x and y, we can't find an exact answer. However, we do know that the total amount Mark makes in a week is 5000 + 5y cents.

{The final answer is: Mark makes 5000 + 5y cents in a week}.</s>","Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.

1. First, let's calculate the one-time monetary reward of $5000. This is a constant amount that John receives with the award.

2. Next, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise on a weekly salary of $2000 is equivalent to an additional $100 per week:
   $2000 * 0.05 = $100

3. Now, we need to find out how much extra money John made each week due to the salary raise. We'll add this amount to his original weekly salary to get his new weekly salary.

   John's new weekly salary = Old weekly salary + Salary raise
   = $2000 + $100
   = $2110

4. Since John works every week of the year (52 weeks), we can find out how much money he made in a year by multiplying his new weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year:

   John's yearly salary = Weekly salary * Number of weeks
   = $2110 * 52

5. Finally, let's calculate John's total earnings in a year:

Since Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch this week and used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, we can calculate how many slices he used for sandwiches in total.
Number of sandwiches = 7 days in a week
Number of slices per sandwich = 2
Total slices of cheese for sandwiches = Number of sandwiches * Number of slices per sandwich
Total slices of cheese for sandwiches = 7 * 2 = 14

Step 2:Find the number of slices Carl used for omelets.
Carl had cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week and used one more slice per omelet than per sandwich. So, the number of slices he used for omelets is:
Total slices of cheese for omelets = Number of omelets * (Number of slices per sandwich + 1)
Total slices of cheese for omelets = 3 * (2 + 1) = 3 * 3 = 9

Step 3:Find the number of slices Carl used for macaroni and cheese.
Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it. So, the number of slices he used for macaroni and cheese is:
Total slices of cheese for macaroni and cheese = Number of slices in the dish
Total slices of cheese for macaroni and cheese = 8

Step 4:Find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used.
Total slices of cheese = Total slices of cheese for sandwiches + Total slices of cheese for omelets + Total slices of cheese for macaroni and cheese
Total slices of cheese = 14 + 9 + 8 = 31

Step 5:Summary
Carl used a total of {31 slices} of cheese in the given week.</s>","His 2-slice sandwiches used 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 slices of cheese for all 7 days of the week.
His cheese and egg omelets used one more slice than his sandwiches, so they used 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 slices of cheese each.
He made 3 omelets, so they used 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 slices of cheese.

                 [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. So, she had a total of 22 + 10 = {32} pens before buying any more.
2. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, and there were 9 pens in each bag. So, she bought 6 × 9 = {54} blue pens.
3. She also bought 2 bags of red pens, and there were 6 pens in each bag. So, she bought 2 × 6 = {12} red pens.
4. Therefore, after buying the blue and red pens, Janet had 32 (green and yellow pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = {98} pens in total.

{The final answer is: Janet has 98 pens.}</s>","Janet previously had 22 + 10 = <<22+10=32>>32 pens.
The number of blue pens is 6 × 9 = <<6*9=54>>54.
The number of red pens is 2 × 6 = <<2*6=12>>12.
Janet has 32 + 54 + 12 = <<32+54+12=98>>98 pens now.

                 [/INST] To determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, follow these steps:

1. Find Brinley's current average without removing the lowest score: Sum of scores / Number of scores = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 89.6
2. Since the lowest score is not considered in the final average, subtract it from the total sum of scores and add one less test score: New total sum = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) - (the lowest score) + 1 -> 452 (since the sum of her 5 scores is 450)
3. Divide the new total sum by the number of tests that will be considered in the final average: New average = 452 / 6 = 75.33
4. To reach an average of 93, find the difference between the desired average and the current new average, then find the difference between Brinley's current new score (the sum of her scores without the lowest one) and the difference you found in step 4, and then divide that difference by the number of tests in a semester: Difference in the average = 93 - 75.33 = 18.67. Brinley's current new score = 450. So, the difference between Brinley's current new score and the final average = 450 - 452 + 18.67 = 22.67. The difference in her sixth test score = 22.67 / number of students = 22.67 / 6 = 3.78.
5. To find the actual difference in Brinley's sixth test score, add 3.78 to her current lowest score (71) to get: New sixth test score = 71 + 3.78 = 74.78
6. Since scores can't be a fraction, Brinley would need to score a whole number close to 74.78 in the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final answer is: Brinley would need to score near 75 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.</s>","First, identify the lowest score, which is 71, and remove it.
Since Brinley wants a score of 93, we know her total score needs to be 93 (average) * 5 (tests) = <<93*5=465>>465 points
So far, Brinley has earned 89 + 92 +100 + 86 = <<89+92+100+86=367>>367 points
The final test must be 465 - 367 = <<465-367=98>>98 points.

After that, he made 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 kilometers a week.
And Micheal did that for three weeks, so he rode 120 * 3 = <<120*3=360>>360 kilometers during that time.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We are given that Joe's bag of candy contains 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples.

Step 2: We are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, and that each chocolate bar weighs 40g.

Step 3: First, let's find the weight of one candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a candied apple, it follows that the weight of one candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g.

Step 4: Next, let's find the total weight of all the candied apples in Joe's bag. We have 80 candied apples, so the total weight is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Step 5: Finally, let's find the total weight of all the chocolate bars plus the total weight of all the candied apples to find the weight of Joe's entire bag of candy. We have 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight is 25 * 40g = 1000g (25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar). The total weight of the candy in Joe's bag is then 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

1. On Monday, Rose went to the store and bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she went to a different store and bought 4 cakes, but the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday was three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So:
   - Cakes bought on Tuesday = 3 * Cakes bought on Monday
   - Cakes bought on Tuesday = 3 * 4
   - Cakes bought on Tuesday = 12 cakes
3. On Wednesday, she went to another store and bought cakes in quantities that were 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday:
   - Cakes bought on Wednesday = 5 * Cakes bought on Tuesday
   - Cakes bought on Wednesday = 5 * 12
   - Cakes bought on Wednesday = 60 cakes
4. To find the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days, we simply add up the number of cakes she bought on each day:
   - Total cakes bought = Cakes bought on Monday + Cakes bought on Tuesday + Cakes bought on Wednesday
   - Total cakes bought = 4 + 12 + 60
   - Total cakes bought = 76 cakes

{The final answer is 76 cakes}.

Therefore, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days.</s>","On Monday she bought 4 cakes

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's determine the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates would cost:

Half a dozen plates = 3 plates
Cost of 3 plates = 3 * $6000 = $18000

Step 2: Next, we need to find the cost of twenty dozens of cups, which is equivalent to 240 cups. We're told that the cost of these cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates. So let's set up an equation:

Cost of 240 cups = Cost of 3 plates - $1200

Step 3: Substitute the costs that we've calculated:

Cost of 240 cups = $18000 - $1200
Cost of 240 cups = $16880

Step 4: Finally, we can find the cost of one cup by dividing the total cost of all the cups by the number of cups:

Cost of one cup = Cost of 240 cups / 240
Cost of one cup = $6945/120
Cost of one cup = $57.88

{The final answer is: Each cup costs $57.88}.</s>","Since a dozen has 12 items, half a dozen plates are 12/2 = <<6=6>>6
Half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each cost 6*$6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000
Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800
Since a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.
If the twenty dozen cups cost $34800, each cup costs $34800/240=$<<34800/240=145>>145

                 [/INST] Let's break this problem down into simpler steps:

1. The cost of the jacket is $30.
2. The cost of each pair of shoes is $20, so the total cost of 2 pairs is $40.
3. The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $70 ($30 for the jacket + $40 for 2 pairs of shoes).
4. Sara earns $5 each time she babysits her neighbor's kids.
5. Sara also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.
6. Sara started with $10 saved, and earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn.
7. To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we need to find out how much money she earns from mowing the lawn and when that amount is greater than or equal to $70.
8. Let x be the number of times Sara mows the lawn. The total amount of money she earns (from babysitting and mowing the lawn) is 4*(earning per babysitting session) + x*(earning per mowing session).
9. We can set up an equation: 4*$5 + x*$4 = $70
10. Solving for x: x = (110 - 4*5)/4 = 22.5
11. Since Sara can't mow the lawn half a time, she'll need to mow an additional full lawn mowing session to reach the $71 needed for the jacket and shoes.

The final answer is: Sara must mow the lawn 23 times.</s>","Both pairs of shoes will cost a total of 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.
Sara will need to save a total of $30 + $40 = $<<30+40=70>>70 to buy everything that she wants.
Sara has earned 4 * $5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 from babysitting.
Between her savings and the babysitting, Sara has already saved $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=30>>30.
Sara needs to earn an additional $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 from mowing the lawn to afford her clothes.

                 [/INST] To find out how many red chickens Jerry has, we first need to determine how many red chickens produce 42 eggs per day. Since a red chicken lays 3 eggs a day, we need to find out how many red chickens it takes to produce 42 eggs a day.

Let X be the number of red chickens.
Then, the number of eggs produced by red chickens a day is 3X.

We know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, so:

3X = 42

To find the number of red chickens, we need to solve for X:

X = 42 / 3
X = 14

However, the problem states that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. Let W be the number of white chickens.

We know that a white chicken lays 5 eggs a day, so:

5W = 42 (we know this is wrong, it should be 3X = 42, and 5W = 3X + 2X = 8X)

Then, the total number of chickens would be X + W = 14 + W

But since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, we have:

W = X + 2

Substituting W in the equation 5W = 42, we get:

5(X + 2) = 42
5X + 10 = 42
5X = 32
X = 6.4

X is not a valid number of chickens.

There seems to be a mistake in the problem, as it doesn't provide consistent information. With the given data, it is not possible to determine the number of red chickens Jerry has. {The final answer is: Unable to determine the number of red chickens with the given information.}</s>","First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the perimeter of the rectangle-shaped park.
The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width. In this case, the length is 1.5 miles and the width is 6 miles.

Perimeter = 2 * (1.5 miles + 6 miles)
= 2 * (1.5 miles + 6 miles)
= 2 * (7.5 miles)
= 15 miles

Step 2: Find out how many hours it takes Gary to walk around the park at his given pace.
Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 15 miles, we divide the total distance by his walking speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles per hour

Step 3: Determine the number of hours Gary spends walking in total.
Since Gary walks at a constant speed and the park's perimeter is a fixed distance, the time it takes him to walk the entire park will remain the same. So, the final answer is:

{The final answer is: It takes Gary 5 hours to walk around the park.}</s>","First find the length of the two long sides of the park: 6 miles * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 miles

Now we know that the small pool has four times as much water as it had 4 minutes ago, and the big pool is leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Since the small pool is leaking at the same rate, we can calculate the current volume of the small pool, starting from 4 minutes ago:

S (current) = S (4 minutes ago) + (leak rate * time)
S (current) = S + (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes)

Since S (4 minutes ago) = 0.5 * B, we can substitute this value in the equation:

S (current) = S + (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes)
S (current) = S + 16 gallons

Now we need to solve for S in terms of B:

S (current) = S + 16 gallons
S = S + 16 gallons - 16 gallons
S = S + 0
S = S

To find out how much S (current) is, we can use the equation we found for the big pool's volume:

B = 2S

We want to find the ratio of the volumes of the big pool to the small pool:

B : S = 2S : S = 2 : 1

Now, since the current ratio is 4 : 1:

B : S = 4S : S

We can solve this equation to find the value of S:

B = 4S
S = B/4

Substitute B with 2S from our initial equation:

S = (2S) / 4

S = 0.5S

S = 0.5 * S

S = 0.5 * S

S = 0.5 * S

And this equation will loop infinitely. Since the initial condition given is not equal to 0 (i.e., the small pool had some water in it at the beginning), this means that the problem does not have a unique solution, and the small pool's current volume depends on the initial volume of the small pool. {The final answer is not provided, as the problem does not have a definitive solution.}</s>","First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons
Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8

Step 2: Calculate how many hours she needs to work to make that amount.
Given that her part-time job pays $8.00 an hour, she will need to work $352.00 / $8.00 = <<352/8=44.5>>44.5 hours.

Since Lori cannot work half an hour, she will have to work at least 45 hours to make enough money for her purchase.

                 [/INST] To find the remaining balance Janeth will have after making the monthly payments, we first need to calculate how many payments she makes in total and then subtract that amount from the original borrowed amount.

1. Calculate the total number of payments: Janeth pays $165 a month for 12 months.
   Total Payments = Monthly Payment * Number of Months
   Total Payments = $165/month * 12 months
   Total Payments = $1980

2. Calculate the amount Janeth will have paid towards the loan by the end of the 12 months:
   Amount Paid = Total Payments
   Amount Paid = $1980

3. Find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount Janeth paid from the original borrowed amount and adding the additional 10% she promised to pay.
   Remaining Balance = Original Borrowed Amount - Amount Paid + (10% of Original Borrowed Amount)
   Remaining Balance = $2000 - $1980 + ($2000 * 0.1)
   Remaining Balance = $2000 - $1980 + $200
   Remaining Balance = $2200

So she is going to pay off a total of $2000 + $200 = $<<2000+200=2200>>2200.
Janeth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.
Hence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. We know that Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, and Harriet's age is half of Zack's age. So we can set up these relationships as equations:
   Adrian = 3 * Harriet
   Harriet = 0.5 * Zack

2. Harriet's age is currently 21 years old. We can use this information to find Zack's age:
   Harriet = 0.5 * Zack
   Substituting Harriet's age of 21 into the equation, we get:
   21 = 0.5 * Zack
   Solving for Zack's age, we get:
   Zack = 21 / 0.5 = 42

3. Now that we know Harriet's and Zack's ages, we can find Adrian's age using the first equation:
   Adrian = 3 * Harriet
   Substituting Harriet's age of 21 into the equation, we get:
   Adrian = 3 * 21 = 63

4. To calculate the average age of the three of them in three years, we'll first find their ages in three years and then calculate the average:
   Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24
   Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45
   Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66

5. The average age of the three of them in three years is:
   Average age = (Harriet's age + Zack's age + Adrian's age) / 3
   Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3

6. Calculate the sum: 24 + 45 + 66 = 135
7. Divide by 3 to find the average: 135 / 3 = 45

{The final answer is: The average age of the three of them in three years is 45 years old.}</s>","In three years, Harriet will be 21+3 = <<21+3=24>>24 years old.
Since Adrian's age is three times that of Harriet, Adrian is 3*21 = <<3*21=63>>63 years old.
In three years, he will be 63+3 =<<63+3=66>>66 years old.
If Harriet is half times the age of Zack, Zack is 21*2 = <<21*2=42>>42 years old.
In three years, he will be 42+3 = <<42+3=45>>45 years old.
The combined age of the three in 3 years will be 45+66+24 = <<45+66+24=135>>135 years.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's first find out how many points each student scored as a percentage of the total.
- Naomi scored 68 points out of 251, which is 27.11% of the total.

Step 2: Yuri scored 10 more points than half of Naomi's score, which is 71.5 points (0.5 * 68 * 1.1).

Step 3: Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so she scored 85 points (68 + 17).

Step 4: Since we know the percentages of points for each student and the total number of points, we can set up an equation to find the number of points Jojo scored:
x = Jojo's points
251 = 27.11% * x + 27.11% * 68 + 27.11% * 71.5 + 27.11% * 85

Step 5: Let's simplify the equation by calculating each term:
251 = 0.2711x + 18.2456 + 19.2262 + 23.4605

Step 6: Combine the constants:
251 = 0.2711x + 61.0323

Step 7: To find x (Jojo's points), we can solve for x by subtracting the constant from both sides of the equation and then divide by the coefficient:
x = (251 - 61.0323) / 0.2711 ≈ 501.34

Since the number of points cannot be a non-integer, this result is an error. It's possible that there is a mistake in the given information or in the calculation process.

Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the number of points Jojo scored. {The final answer is: We cannot determine the number of points Jojo scored.}</s>","Naomi scored 68 points.

Initial amount = 120 L
Water used by Celine = 90 L
Liters of water left = Initial amount - Water used

= 30 L

Step 2: Next, we are told that Celine was able to collect rainwater that was twice as much as what was left in the tank. Let's denote the amount of rainwater collected as R.

Liters of rainwater collected = 2 * Liters of water left

Step 3: We can now set up an equation to represent the total amount of water in the tank, which is equal to the initial amount plus the rainwater collected:

Total amount = Initial amount + Liters of rainwater collected

Substituting the values we found earlier:

Total amount = 120 L + 2 * 30 L

Step 4: Multiply the liters of water left by 2 to find out how many liters of rainwater were collected.

Liters of rainwater collected = 2 * 30 L = 60 L

Step 5: Add the initial amount of water and the liters of rainwater collected:

Total amount = 120 L + 60 L = 180 L

                    James ? is counting : his Pokemon cards. , He has : 30 fire type, ; 20 grass type, and ? 40 water type. If he loses 8 , of the water type ; and buys 14 grass type, what's the percentage ; chance (rounded to the ! nearest integer) , that . a randomly : picked card ; will be ; a water type?
                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many water, grass, and fire type cards James initially has:

Initial number of cards:
Water type: 30 + (-8) = 22
Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
Fire type: 30

Now, James has 22 water, 34 grass, and 30 fire type cards in total. The question asks for the percentage chance (rounded to the nearest integer) that a randomly picked card is a water type. To find this, we need to calculate the percentage of water type cards among all cards.

Percentage chance:
Total number of cards = 22(water) + 34(grass) + 30(fire) = 86
Percentage chance for water = (Number of water cards / Total number of cards) * 100

Calculate the percentage:
Percentage chance = (22 / 86) * 100 = 25.56%

Since the question asks for an integer value, we round down to the nearest integer. So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card is a water type is:

{The final answer is: 25%}</s>","First find the final number of grass type Pokemon: 20 grass type + 14 grass type = <<20+14=34>>34 grass type
Then find the final number of water type Pokemon: 40 water type - 8 water type = <<40-8=32>>32 water type
Then add the number of each type of Pokemon to find the total number: 34 Pokemon + 32 Pokemon + 30 Pokemon = <<34+32+30=96>>96 Pokemon
Then divide the number of water type Pokemon by the total number of Pokemon and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 32 water type / 96 Pokemon * 100% = 33.333...%, which rounds down to 33%

Question: Dax went to their farm to pick some apples and found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. If there were 50 ants, calculate the total number of insects in the garden.

Step 2: Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can find the number of bugs by multiplying the number of ants by 2.

Step 3: So, the number of bugs = 2 × Number of ants

Step 4: Given, the number of ants = 50

Step 5: Therefore, the number of bugs = 2 × 50 = 100

Step 6: We've found the number of ants and bugs, but the problem asks for the total number of insects is in the garden. We know that both ants and bugs are types of insects, so we just need to add the two numbers together.

Step 7: Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs

Step 8: Total number of insects = 50 + 100 = 150

- We know that Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and he eats twice as much as his girlfriend.
- So, his girlfriend eats 6 tomatoes per day as well, making Steve's tomato consumption 2 * 6 = 12 tomatoes per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so Steve eats 12 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 84 tomatoes/week.

Step 2: Calculate how many tomatoes one vine produces per week.
- The problem states that one vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

Step 3: Determine how many vines Steve needs to meet his weekly tomato consumption.
- Steve consumes 84 tomatoes/week, so he will need a number of vines such that the total number of tomatoes they produce per week is equal to 84.
- To find this number, we divide the total number of tomatoes Steve needs by the number of tomatoes one vine produces per week: 84 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine = 28.13 vines (approximately). Since we can't have a fraction of a vine, Steve will need to round up to the next whole number: 29 vines.

1. Each pizza provides 8 slices.
2. Each friend needs 4 slices.
3. So, the number of pizzas required = (number of friends) / (number of slices per friend)
4. The number of slices one friend gets = 4 * (number of pizzas) / (number of slices per pizza)
5. Setting up the equation: 20 = (number of pizzas) * (4 / 8)
6. Simplifying the equation: 20 = number of pizzas * (1/2)
7. Solving for the number of pizzas: number of pizzas = 20 * (1 / 1/2) = 20 * 2 = 40

However, we made an error in our calculation. The correct equation should be 20 = (number of pizzas) * (4 / 8), which simplifies to 20 = number of pizzas * 1/2 or number of pizzas = 20 * 2 = 40.

1. Ram initially uses a lot of pens. We don't know exactly how many. Let's call this number X.

2. Ram discovered that he can save money by mixing ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. This means that for every group of five empty pens, he can create one new full pen.

3. Ram buys 25 new pens. Let's call the number of full pens he gets from these 25 pens Y. Since one full pen is made from five empty pens, then each full pen makes five empty pens. Therefore, Y * 5 equals the number of empty pens Ram gets from the 25 new pens.

4. These empty pens are used to make new pens when the ink runs low. Since Ram uses one empty pen to make one new pen, then the number of new pens he makes is equal to the number of empty pens he has.

5. To find the total number of pens Ram has after using the 25 new pens to make new ones, we need to find the sum of the initial number of pens (X) and the number of new pens created from the empty pens (the number of which is Y * 5).

We can simplify this to: Mary's age = x + 3

To find the sum of their ages, we just need to find the sum of x, x + 5, and x + 3:

The sum of their ages is x + (x+5) + (x+3) = 3x + 8

But we know that Jessa is 20 years old, which means x = 20. So we can find the sum of their ages by substituting x = 20:

Sum of their ages = 3x + 8 = 3(20) + 8 = 62 + 8 = 70

{The final answer is: The sum of the ages of the three girls is 70.}</s>","Joan is 20 + 5 = <<20+5=25>>25 years old.
Mary is 25 – 2 = <<25-2=23>>23 years old.
Therefore, the sum of their ages is 20 + 25 + 23 = <<20+25+23=68>>68.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of students who went out through exit A and exit B.

First, let's find out how many students went out through exit A. We know that 30% of the students left through this exit. So, we calculate:

Students who went out through exit A = Total students * Percentage of students who went through exit A
= 1000 students * 0.3
= 300 students

Next, we need to find out how many students went out through exit B. We know that 3/5 of the remaining students went out through this exit. Let's first find out how many students were left after the 30% went out through exit A.

Students remaining = Total students - Students who went out through exit A
= 1000 students - 300 students
= 700 students

Now, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:

Students who went out through exit B = Students remaining * Percentage of students who went through exit B
= 700 students * (3/5)
= 700 students * 0.6
= 420 students

Step 2: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C.

We know that the remaining students went out through exit C. The total number of students was 1000, and 30% of them (or 300 students) went out through exit A, and 3/5 of the remaining students (or 420 students) went out through exit B. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

Students who went out through exit C = Total students - Students who went out through exit A - Students who went out through exit B
= 1000 students - 300 students - 420 students
= 280 students

{The final answer is 280 students went out through exit C.}</s>","The number of students who went out through exit A is 30/100%1000 = 300 students.

3/5 of the students used exit B, a total of 3/5*700 = <<3/5*700=420>>420 students.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as R. Then, James has R + 6 and John has 2R. We are given that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation:

2R = 54

To find the value of R, we can solve for it:

R = 54 / 2
R = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James and John have:

James has R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 candies
John has 2R = 2 * 27 = 54 candies

To find the difference in the number of candies between John and James, we can simply subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

The difference is 54 (John's candies) - 33 (James' candies) = 21 candies.

So, John has 21 more candies than James. {The final answer is 21}.</s>","Robert has 54/2 = <<54/2=27>>27 candies.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many people Mike is no longer corresponding with.
The problem states that Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, and he stopped being penpals with 2 of them. So, Mike is currently corresponding with 3 people.

Step 2: Calculate the number of letters exchanged per week with each person.
Each letter is 5 pages long, and there are 7 days in a week. So, each person sends 2 letters per week, which is a total of 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 pages per week.

Step 3: Determine how long it takes Mike to write a single page.
The problem states that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.

Step 4: Calculate how long it takes Mike to write a single letter.
Since a letter is 5 pages long, it takes Mike 5 pages * 6 minutes per page = <<5*6=30>>30 minutes to write a single letter.

Step 5: Determine how many minutes Mike spends writing letters per week.
Since Mike is currently corresponding with 3 people, he spends this amount of time writing letters per week: 3 people * 10 pages per week (for each person) * 30 minutes per page = <<3*10*30=900>>900 minutes per week.

Step 6: Convert the number of minutes spent writing letters per week to hours.
To find the hours spent writing letters per week, divide the number of minutes by the number of minutes in an hour: 900 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = <<900/60=15>>15 hours per week.

{The final answer is Mike spends 15 hours per week writing letters.}</s>","He is penpals with 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 people

Minutes per call = 15 minutes
Frequency of calls = 1 call per day
Total minutes for boss calls = Minutes per call * Frequency of calls * Number of days
Total minutes for boss calls = 15 minutes * 1 call * 30 days = 450 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the number of minutes Jason has used for calls with his boss this month.
Total minutes for boss calls = 450 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the number of minutes Jason has used for calls other than those with his boss.

3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 5 * 2 = 10 fries, leaving Griffin with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries such that Griffin had 27 fries in total.
5. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as ""x"". So, we have 9 (initial fries) + x (fries from Ginger) = 27 (total number of fries after all the transactions).

From the problem statement, we have:

S1 = 4
S2 = 32
S1 + S2 = 2(F1 + F2)

Now we need to find F1 and F2. Let's first find the expression for the total number of snails in both aquariums:

S1 + S2 = 4 + 32 = 36

Next, we'll express F1 and F2 in terms of S1 and S2 using the given condition that the difference between the number of snails in both aquariums is twice the number of fish in both tanks:

S1 + S2 = 2(F1 + F2)

Substituting S1 = 4 and S2 = 32, we get:

4 +32 = 2(F1 + F2)

Solving this equation for F1 and F2, we have:

F1 + F2 = 12
F1 = 12 - F2

Since S1 = 4 and S2 = 32, we want to find values for F1 and F2 that satisfy this relationship. We can find possible integer values by trying out different values for F2:

If F2 = 4, then F1 = 12 - 4 = 8

{The final answer is 8 fish in the first aquarium and 14 fish in the second aquarium}.

If F2 = 5, then F1 = 12 - 5 = 7

If F2 = 6, then F1 = 12 - 6 = 6

And so on...

Therefore, one possible solution with integer values for the number of fish in both aquariums is 8 fish in the first aquarium and 14 fish in the second aquarium.</s>","The difference between the number of snails is 32 - 4 = <<32-4=28>>28 snails.

2. It takes 6 hours to do her makeup for the movie each day.
3. She needs her makeup done 4 times a week.
4. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

First, let's calculate the cost of Jean's makeup for the entire movie shoot.

5. The cost for one day is $250/hour * 6 hours.
      = $1500
6. The cost for one week is $1500/day * 4 days/week.

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the total amount spent by the chef step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many pounds of onions the chef bought in total. Since he bought 4 bags, each weighing 50 pounds, that's:
   Pounds of onions = Number of bags * Weight per bag
   = 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag
   = 200 pounds

2. Next, we need to find out how many pounds of onions cost $1.50. We can set up a proportion to solve for the number of pounds that cost $1.50:
   1 pound = $1.50
   x pounds = $y
   Solving for x, we get:
   x = y * (1 pound / $1.50)
   x = y * 0.67 pounds/dollar
    
3. We don't know the exact quantity of onions that cost $1.50 in the problem, so we can't use this calculation to find the total cost directly. However, now we have a conversion factor of 0.67 pounds/dollar to use in the next step.

4. To find the total amount spent, we can use the total weight of onions and the conversion factor:
   Total cost = Pounds of onions * Cost per pound
   = 200 pounds * Cost per pound
   = 200 pounds * $x/pound
   = $y

5. Substituting the conversion factor of 0.67 pounds/dollar into the equation, we get:
   Total cost = 200 pounds * $1/0.67 pounds
   = $200/0.67 ≈ $302.99

So the chef spent approximately $302.99 on the onions. {The final answer is $302.99}.</s>","A bag of onions cost $1.50 x 50 = $<<1.5*50=75>>75.

4. Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday and 26 cookies on Tuesday, for a total of 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.
5. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, for a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.
6. So, Sue consumed a total of 46 - 18 = 28 additional cookies and, therefore, calories.
7. Since one cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed an additional 28 * 200 = 5600 calories.

First, let's find out the total number of students in the school:
Total students = Number of students in each class * Number of classes
Total students = 20 * 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 students

Since there are equal numbers of boys and girls in the school, the number of girls is:
number of girls = Total students / 2
number of girls = 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 girls

We know that there are 15 girls in the first class and 12 girls in the second class. So, the number of girls in the third class is:
number of girls in third class = Total girls - Girls in first two classes
number of girls in third class = 30 - 15 - 12 = <<30-15-12=3>>3 girls

Since there are equal numbers of boys and girls, the number of boys in the third class is:
number of boys in third class = Total students - Boys in first two classes - Boys in third class
number of boys in third class = 60 - (15 + 12) = 5 * 11 = <<5*11=55>>55 boys

Step 1: Find the initial number of apps on Travis's tablet
The question states that Travis had 61 apps on his tablet.

Step 2: Find the number of apps deleted
Travis deleted 9 apps.

Step 3: Find the number of apps downloaded
Travis downloaded 18 new apps.

Step 4: Calculate the final number of apps on Travis's tablet
To find the current number of apps on Travis's tablet, we subtract the number of deleted apps from the initial number and add the number of downloaded apps:

Final number of apps = Initial number of apps - Number of deleted apps + Number of downloaded apps
               = 61 - 9 + 18

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of wolves Rick killed on the last night as W, and the number of cougars he killed on the last night as C.

From the problem statement, we have:

W + C = 15 + 10 = 25 {Rick killed 15 cougars and 10 wolves on the last night, so the total number of animals he killed was 25.}

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, so we can write an equation for the number of wolves and cougars Rick killed today:

W_today = 3C_today

Also, Rick killed three fewer cougars than he did on the last night, so we can write an equation for the number of cougars Rick killed today:

C_today = C - 3

From the problem statement, we're told that the total number of animals Rick killed today is the same as the number he killed on the last night, so we can write an equation for the total number of animals Rick killed:

W + C = W_today + C_today

Substituting the equations we have for W and C from the last night and the equations we have for W and C today, we get:

(1)  (15 + 10) = (3C_today) + (C_today - 3)

Solving this equation, we first eliminate C_today by adding 3 to both sides:

(16) 25 = 4C_today + C_today - 3

We can now combine like terms to get:

(2) 25 = 5C_today - 3

Adding 3 to both sides to isolate 5C_today gives:

(3) 28 = 5C_today

Now, we can divide both sides by 5 to find the value of C_today:

C_today = 5.6 {The value of C_today is approximately 5.6, but since we cannot have a fractional number of cougars or wolves, this tells us that there is an error in the problem statement.}

However, since we cannot have a fractional number of animals, this problem seems to contain inconsistent information, and the answer is ambiguous. Therefore, the problem as stated cannot be solved.

{The final answer is: The information provided is inconsistent, so the answer cannot be determined.}</s>","The total number of animals that Rick killed while hunting yesterday is 15+10 = <<15+10=25>>25
Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, a total of 15-3 = <<15-3=12>>12 cougars.
He also killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, a total of 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 wolves.
Together, his hunt today yielded 36+12 = <<36+12=48>>48 animals.

Anne went down the water slide 30 % * 30 = 9 times

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide. We know that he went down 4 times as much as Anne. So, we calculate this as follows:

Robert went down the water slide 4 * 9 = 36 times

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that there are initially 10 stalls, each containing 20 cows, so there are a total of 10 * 20 = <<10*20=200>>200 cows.

Step 2: Mr. Sylas buys an additional 40 cows, so there are now a total of 200 + 40 = <<200+40=240>>240 cows.

Step 3: Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the new cows into each of the 20 stalls. So, we need to find out how many new cows go into one stall: 240 total cows / 20 stalls = <<240/20=12>>12 new cows per stall.

Step 4: We want to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since 8 stalls receive 12 new cows each, there are a total of 8 * 12 = <<8*12=96>>96 new cows in those 8 stalls.

Step 5: Since each of those 8 stalls now has a total capacity of 20 (initial) cows + 12 (new) cows = <<20+12=32>>32 cows, and there are 96 new cows in each group of 8 stalls, we notice that 32 * 3 = <<32*3=96>>96 is a multiple of both 32 and 3. This means that each group of 8 stalls must contain exactly 96 new cows, not the calculated 96 new cows from Step 4. But we reached this number of new cows by taking 12 new cows per stall and multiplying by the number of stalls (8). Therefore, there must be an error in the problem.

However, if we were to follow the information in the problem up to this point, we would assume that there are 96 new cows in 8 of the stalls.

{The final answer, based on the information given in the problem, is: There are 96 new cows in 8 of the stalls.}

However, since the information provided contains an error, it's essential to double-check any information and ensure its accuracy before accepting it as the final answer.</s>","When Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the cows he bought into the stalls, each stall gets 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 new cows.
Each of the stalls gets four cows, meaning a total of 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 cows are placed into eight of the stalls.
Since each stall had 20 cows before Mr. Sylas added four into each of the stalls, the total number of cows in eight of the stalls was 8*20= <<8*20=160>>160 cows.
There are 160+32 = <<160+32=192>>192 cows in eight stalls after Mr. Sylas adds four into each of the stalls.

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the total amount of money Brady has step by step:

1. First, let's find the number of pennies Brady has: 100 pennies.
2. Next, let's calculate the number of nickels and the amount of money they represent: 40 nickels, and each nickel is worth $0.05; so, 40 nickels = $2.00.
3. Then, let's calculate the number of dimes and the amount of money they represent: 20 dimes, and each dime is worth $0.10; so, 20 dimes = $2.00.
4. Now, let's calculate the number of dollar bills and the amount of money they represent: 40 dollar bills, and each dollar bill is worth $1.00; so, 40 dollar bills = $40.00.
5. Finally, let's find the total amount of money Brady has: $1.00 (pennies) * 100 + $0.05 (nickels) * 40 + $0.10 (dimes) * 20 + $1.00 (dollar bills) * 40

Let's simplify this equation: 
Sum = $100 + $2 + $20 + $40 = $142

{The final answer is: $142.00}</s>","Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.
Since nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.
Since a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.
So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.

Each section of the redwood tree is 10 feet tall, and it weighs 400 pounds.

Step 2: Find the weight of one foot of the redwood tree.
To find the weight of one foot, divide the weight of one section by the number of feet in that section.
Weight per foot = Weight of one section / Number of feet in one section
Weight per foot = 400 pounds / 10 feet = 40 pounds

Step 3: Determine the amount of wood lost to termites.
The redwood tree is 200 feet tall, and termites have eaten 30% of the wood. First, find the weight of the wood that was in the tree. Then find the weight of the wood that was eaten by termites.

Weight of wood in the tree = Height of the tree * Weight per foot
Weight of wood in the tree = 200 feet * 40 pounds/foot = 8000 pounds

Percentage of wood eaten = 30%
Weight of wood eaten by termites = Percentage of wood eaten * Weight of wood in the tree
Weight of wood eaten by termites = 0.3 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds

Step 4: Calculate the weight of the redwood tree without the termite-eaten wood.
Weight of the redwood tree = Weight of wood in the tree - Weight of wood eaten by termites.

                 [/INST] Let's first clarify the given information and set up some variables:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. Let's represent the number of apples Jamal has as A, so Andrea has A + 8 apples. We are given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can set up an equation: A + 8 = 52.
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. Let's represent the number of bananas Jamal has as B. So Andrea has B / 2 bananas.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. We know the number of apples Jamal has is A and the number of bananas Jamal has is B. The equation for Jamal's bananas is B = A + 4.

We need to find out the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have. Since the problem doesn't specify whether apples or bananas are considered ""fruits,"" we'll assume that both types of fruit are counted.

Now let's solve the equations to find the number of apples and bananas Jamal has:

Step 1: Solve for A from the equation A +8 = 52:
A = 52 - 8 = 44

Step 2: Solve for B from the equation B = A + 4:
B = 44 + 4 = 48

Now that we have the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal, we can find the total number of fruits they have:

Total fruits = Apples (Andrea) + Bananas (Andrea) + Apples (Jamal) + Bananas (Jamal)
Total fruits = (A + 8) + B + A + B
Total fruits = 2(A + 8) + 2B
Total fruits = 2(44 + 8) + 2(48)

Step 3: Calculate the total number of fruits:
Total fruits = 2(52) + 2(48) = 104 + 96 = 200

The total number of apples is 44+52 = <<44+52=96>>96
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which totals 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
There are a total of 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 bananas.

Step 2: Find out how much flour Carla needs for baking 36 cookies today.
Carla is making 36 cookies today, so the amount of flour she needs can be calculated as follows:

Flour needed for 36 cookies = Flour needed for one cookie * Number of cookies
= 1/6 cup * 36
= 6 cups

The final answer for the flour needed for baking cookies today is 6 cups.

Step 3: Calculate the flour Carla needs for making 30 cookies tomorrow.
Carla is making 30 cookies tomorrow, so the amount of flour she needs can be computed as follows:

Flour needed for 30 cookies = Flour needed for one cookie * Number of cookies
= 1/6 cup * 30
= 5 cups

The final answer for the flour needed for baking cookies tomorrow is 5 cups.

In summary:
Two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. Carla is making a total of 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. Therefore, she would need 6 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and 5 cups of flour to make the cookies tomorrow. {The final answer is 6 cups for today and 5 cups for tomorrow.}</s>","Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.
Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, then 66 cookies are equal to 66/12 = <<66/12=5.5>>5.5 dozens.
Hence, Carla will need 5.5 x 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 cups of flour.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of the house.
Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the transfer fee.
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price of the house.
Transfer fee = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the house.
Total cost = $350,000 + $17,500 (brokerage fee) + $42,000 (transfer fee) = $369,500

Step 4: Determine the difference between the total cost and Mrs. Cruz's budget.
Difference = $369,500 (total cost) - $400,000 (Mrs. Cruz's budget) = -$30,500

However, since Mrs. Cruz's budget is less than the total cost, this indicates that she cannot afford the house.
{The final answer is: Mrs. Cruz will not be able to purchase the house as it goes beyond her $400,000 budget. Instead, she would need to find a house with a lower selling price or look for ways to reduce her expenses, such as negotiating a lower brokerage fee or transfer fee.}</s>","The brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17500.

                 [/INST] To find the total time it takes to heat the oil to 300 degrees and cook the chicken, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, let's find out how long it takes to heat the oil from its initial temperature to 300 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes.

2. The oil then takes 40% longer time to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees. Let x be the time in minutes it takes to heat up the oil from 300 to 400 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer, we have:

x = 20 minutes * 1.4 = 28 minutes

3. So, the total time it takes to heat the oil from its initial temperature to 400 degrees is 20 minutes + 28 minutes = 48 minutes.

4. Finally, the problem states that after warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to warm the oil. Therefore, the time it takes to cook the chicken is:

Cooking Time = Warming Time - 5 minutes
Cooking Time = 48 minutes - 5 minutes = 43 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 48 minutes (heating up to 400 degrees) + 43 minutes (cooking time) = {The final answer is 91 minutes}.</s>","It takes 20*.4=8 more minutes to go from 300 to 400 degrees than from room temperature to 300

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. So,

Number of stitches for the rosette = 2 * 90 = 180 stitches

Step 2: Calculate the number of stitches for each sleeve.

We know that the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, so when we add up the number of stitches for the body, the collar, the rosette, and the two sleeves, we should get 1800 stitches:

900 (body) + 90 (collar)+ 180 (rosette) + 2 * X (sleeve) = 1800

Since we know the number of stitches for the body, the collar, and the rosette, we can find the number of stitches for each sleeve, X:

X = 1800 - 900 - 90 - 180
X = 630

So, each sleeve takes 630 stitches to complete.

{The final answer is: Each sleeve takes 630 stitches.}</s>","The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.
The rosette takes 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 stitches.
The body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = <<900+90+180=1170>>1170 stitches.
Thus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.
Thus, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = <<630/2=315>>315 stitches.

How ? many lines ; does ! Sean ; have to memorize?
                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Sean is practicing for a theater production.
2. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song.
3. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, but only a third of them are his lines.
4. The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, and four-fifths of them are his.

Let's represent the number of lines in the solo song as ""x"".

Then, the number of lines in the first scene is 2x, and the number of lines in the second scene is x + 6.

The number of lines in the first scene that are Sean's is a third of the total lines, so that's 1/3 * (2x).

The number of lines in the second scene that are Sean's is four-fifths of the total lines, so that's 4/5 * (x + 6).

The total number of lines that Sean has to memorize is the sum of the lines in both scenes and the solo song:

Total lines = 1/3 * (2x) + 1/5 * (x + 6) + x

To find the value of this expression, we can simplify it by finding a common denominator and combining the fractions:

Total lines = (2/3 * x + x) + (3/5 * (x + 6) + 2x/5)
Total lines = (2x + x) + (3x + 12 + 2x/5)
Total lines = 3x + 12 + 2x/5
Total lines = 3x + 12 + x*(2/5)
Total lines = 3x + 12 + 2x/5
Total lines = 3x + 12 + (2x/5)
Total lines = 3x + 12 + (x/2.5)
Total lines = 4.5x + 12

Substituting the value of the number of lines in the solo song (x), we get:

Total lines = 4.5 * (54) + 12
Total lines = 4.5 * 54 + 12
Total lines = 235.4 + 12
Total lines = 247.4

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a line, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number:

The final answer is 248 lines.</s>","The first scene has twice the number of lines as his solo song, so it has 2 * 54 = <<2*54=108>>108 lines.
A third of them are Sean’s lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = <<108/3=36>>36 lines.
The second scene has 54 + 6 = <<54+6=60>>60 lines.
Four fifths of the second scene’s lines are Sean’s, so he has to memorize 4 * 60 / 5 = 4 * 12 = <<4*60/5=48>>48 lines.
Sean has to memorize his entire solo song, so he has to memorize 54 + 36 + 48 = <<54+36+48=138>>138 lines in all.

2. 1/2 of the remaining cards have B. So 1/2 * (80 - 32) = 21.33 (rounded to 21 since we can't have a fraction of a card). So 21 cards have B.
3. 5/8 of the remaining cards have C. So 5/8 * (80 - 32 - 21) = 20 cards have C.

Now, to find the number of cards with D, we subtract the number of cards with A, B, and C from the original number of cards:

And in 9 years, Sam's age will be ""s + 9"".

The problem states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we have the equation:

To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).

                 [/INST] To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to determine how many beads are required to fill up the space between the topaz gemstones.

1. The length of one topaz gemstone is one inch.
2. The length of one sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch.
3. There are 8 topaz gemstones in a necklace.

Let's find out how many inches of beads are needed to fill up the space between these 8 gemstones.

4. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
5. The length of one topaz gemstone plus the beads between two gemstones constitutes one ""gemstone-bead unit"". Thus, each gemstone-bead unit is one inch + (number of beads) x (quarter of an inch).
6. Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, the total number of gemstone-bead units is 8.
7. The total length of all the gemstone-bead units should be equal to the total length of the necklace. So, 8 x (one inch + (number of beads) x (quarter of an inch)) = 25 inches.

By solving the equation, we get:
1 x (1 + (number of beads) x 0.25) = 25 / 8
1 + (number of beads) x 0.25 = 3.125
(number of beads) x 0.25 = 1.125
number of beads = 4.6

Since we cannot have a fraction of a bead, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, the number of beads between each pair of topaz gemstones is 5.

With 8 topaz gemstones in a necklace, the total number of gemstone-bead units is 8. Each gemstone-bead unit comprises one topaz gemstone and 5 beads.

Therefore, the total number of beads used in a necklace is 8 (topaz gemstones) x 6 (beads per topaz gemstone) = 48 x 6 = 288 beads.

{The final answer is 288 sterling silver beads}</s>","8 topaz gemstones, at 1 inch per gemstone, contribute a total of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 inches to each necklace.
Since each necklace is 25 inches in length, then there are 25-8=<<25-8=17>>17 inches of space between gemstones.
Since Katerina uses one-quarter inch sterling silver beads to fill space between gemstones, then she will require 17*4=<<17*4=68>>68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many cents Kelly has in total with 5 quarters and 2 dimes.

Quarters: 5 * 25 cents (since each quarter is worth 25 cents) = $1.25
Dimes: 2 * 10 cents (since each dime is worth 10 cents) + 2 * 10 cents = $0.40

To find the total amount of money Kelly has, add the number of quarters and dimes together:

Total money = $1.25 (quarters) + $0.40 (dimes) = $1.65

Since she spent 55 cents on a can of pop, let's find out how many cents she has left:

Total money = $1.65
Amount spent on the can of pop = 55 cents

Now, let's find the difference between the total money and the amount spent on the can of pop:

Money left = Total money - Amount spent
Money left = $1.65 - 55 cents
Money left = $1.10

{The final answer is: Kelly will have $1.10 left after buying a can of pop that costs 55 cents.}</s>","Her quarters are worth 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 cents.

                    question:
                    ? A 76-star flag has three rows , of 8 ! stars, two rows of 6 stars ! and , the rest are 5-star rows. . How many rows of 5 , stars , are there altogether on the ; flag?
                 [/INST] To find out how many rows of 5-star stars are there on the flag, we first need to determine the number of rows for each star size given in the problem. We have the following information:

- Three rows of 8 ! stars (The exclamation mark denotes factorial, which means there are 8 stars in each row.)
- Two rows of 6 stars

Let's calculate the number of rows for the given star sizes:

1. The number of rows for 8-star rows is 3.
2. The number of rows for 6-star rows is 2.

Now, let's find out how many rows are left for 5-star rows. Since there are only three types of star rows in the flag, we can calculate the number of rows for 5-star rows by subtracting the number of rows for 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of rows in the flag:

Total number of rows = Number of rows (8-star) + Number of rows (6-star) + Number of rows (5-star)

We already know the number of rows for the 8-star and 6-star rows. We can find the number of rows for the 5-star rows by solving the equation for the unknown:

Total number of rows = 3 (rows of 8-star) * 8 (stars per row) + 2 (rows of 6-star) * 6 (stars per row) + x (rows of 5-star)

3 * 8 + 2 * 6 + x = Total number of rows

We don't have enough information about the total number of rows in the flag, so we need to make an assumption or determine it from the problem statement to find the value of x. Let's assume there are 15 rows in total for this calculation:

3 * 8 + 2 * 6 + x = 15
24 + 2 * 6 + x = 15
24 + 12 + x = 15
x = 15 - 24 - 12 = 1

So, according to our assumption, there's 1 row of 5-star stars on the flag. It's important to note that without knowing the exact total number of rows in the flag, our answer remains an assumption.

Considering the given problem statement, it seems more likely that there is a mistake in it, as there's no room for only one row of 5-star stars in the problem description (three rows of 8-star, two rows of 6-star, and the rest are supposed to be 5-star rows). It's best to double-check the problem statement and clarify any ambiguities before proceeding with the calculation.

{The final answer is uncertain and depends on the total number of rows in the flag.}</s>","The rows of 8 stars have a total of: 3 rows * 8 stars/row = <<3*8=24>>24 stars.
The rows of 6 stars have a total of: 2 rows * 6 stars/row = <<2*6=12>>12 stars.
Including the rows of 8 and 6 stars, we have 24 stars + 12 stars = <<24+12=36>>36 stars.
Now we need to know how many stars are missing, 76 stars - 36 stars = <<76-36=40>>40 stars.
Now we need to distribute the missing stars in rows of 5 stars, 40 stars/5 rows = <<40/5=8>>8 rows of 5 stars.

                 [/INST] To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and then divide that weight by the weight capacity of each truck to find out how many trucks are required.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.
Weight of one flagstone = 75 pounds
Total weight of 80 flagstones = 80 * 75 = 6000 pounds

Step 2: Calculate how many trucks are needed to transport this weight.
Weight capacity of one truck = 2000 pounds
Number of trucks needed = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of one truck = 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds = 3 trucks

However, since we can't split a truck's load, we can only transport the flagstones in whole trucks. As each truck can carry 80 flagstones (with a total weight of 6000 pounds), and we only need 3 trucks in total to transport all 80 flagstones, it means that one trip can transport all 80 flagstones with just 3 trucks.

Therefore, the final answer is: Three trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.</s>","The 80 flagstones weight 75 * 80 = <<75*80=6000>>6000 pounds.
Thus, the landscaping company will need 6000 / 2000 = <<6000/2000=3>>3 trucks to transport the flagstones in one trip.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's find out how far the car in the fast lane travels in 480 miles. Distance = Speed * Time. The car in the fast lane travels at 60 miles per hour.
Distance covered by the car in the fast lane = Speed * Time

Step 2: To find the time taken by the car in the fast lane to cover 480 miles, we need to divide the total distance by the speed:
Time = Distance / Speed

Step 3: Since we don't know the time taken by the car in the fast lane, we cannot directly calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane. But we know that the car in the slow lane travels at half the speed of the car in the fast lane (30 mph or 0.375 hours/mile).

Step 4: Let's first find out how many miles the car in the slow lane covers in the same time as the car in the fast lane covers 480 miles. Given that the car in the fast lane travels at 60 mph and the car in the slow lane travels at half that speed, we can calculate the distance covered by the slow car:

Distance covered by the car in the slow lane = Distance covered by the car in the fast lane * (Speed of slow car / Speed of fast car)

Step 5: Since we don't know the time taken by the car in the fast lane, we cannot directly calculate the distance covered by it in 480 miles. We can express the relationship between the time, speed, and distance for both cars using the given information:
60 mph * Time = 480 miles
0.375 mph/mile * Time' = Distance' (distance covered by the car in the slow lane)

We can now express the relationship between Time and Time' using the given information:
60 * Time = 480
Time = 8 hours
0.375 * Time' = Distance'
Time' = Distance' / (0.375 * 60) => Time' = 480 / 2.25
Time' = 211.111 hours

Since we cannot have hours with decimals in our answer, we need to round up Time' to the nearest whole number:
Time' = 212 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane covers a distance of 212 hours * 0.375 miles per hour = 78.78 miles.

Step 6: Since the final answer must be in miles and not hours, we cannot directly determine the exact answer with the given information since the cars' speeds are not specified in terms of miles per hour, only miles per mile and hours per mile.

{The final answer is, with the given information, it's impossible to determine the exact distance the car in the slow lane covers in 480 miles.}</s>","At half the speed, the car in the slow lane travels at a speed of 1/2*60 = <<1/2*60=30>>30 miles per hour.

x > 10(22 + y)

To find the minimum value of x that satisfies this inequality, we can start by finding the possible minimum value of y. Since y < 22, the smallest possible value for y is 0.

When y = 0, we have x > 10(22), or x > 220. Thus, the minimum possible number of medals given out for counting is 221 (since the first medal was given to Ali).

First, let's figure out how many 10-minute intervals there are in 3 hours. We know that 1 hour = 60 minutes, so 3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. Now, we can divide the number of minutes by the number of minutes in a 10-minute interval to find the number of intervals: 180 minutes / 10 minutes = 18.

Susan takes a half-hour break, which is 30 minutes. So, she works for (18 intervals * 10 minutes) - (1 break interval * 10 minutes) = (180 minutes - 10 minutes) / 10 minutes = 17 intervals.

Since Susan earns $5 for every 10-minute interval, her total earnings are 17 intervals * $5/interval = $85.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's first find out the number of points each friend has after three rounds. Since Mike has 21 points and Jim has 2 less points than Mike, Jim has 19 points. To find Tony's points, we know he has 2 times more points than Mike, so he has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

{Mike has 21 points, Jim has 19 points, and Tony has 42 points after three rounds.}

Step 2: In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So let's see which friends receive an extra point.

Mike: 21 > 20, so Mike gets an extra point.
Jim: 19 > 19 (Jim already had an extra point because he had less points than Mike), so Jim doesn't get an additional extra point.
Tony: 42 > 20, so Tony gets an extra point.

{Mike, Jim, and Tony get one extra point each in the fourth round.}

Mike: 21 (base points) + 1 (extra point) = 22 points
Jim: 19 (base points) + 1 (extra point) = 20 points

                 [/INST] Let's go through this problem step by step:

1. We know that ""; buys, 15 oranges."" So we have 15 oranges to start with.
2. ""When : he gets home, ?"". This means that the oranges are still with the person at home. No oranges have been used in the washing process yet.
3. ""he asks his 2 sons to wash as many : oranges as they are years : old."" So, the older son washes as many oranges as he is years old, and the younger son washes as many oranges as he is years old.
4. ""The ; oldest son is ! 8 years ! old, the youngest ! is : half as old as the . oldest."" Therefore, the oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is 4 years old.
5. The number of oranges washed by each son is equal to their age in years. So, the older son washes 8 oranges, and the younger son washes 4 oranges.
6. However, we haven't considered the number of oranges that remained unwashed.
7. To find this, we need to know the total number of oranges and the number of oranges washed.
8. From our calculations earlier, we found out that 8 oranges were washed by the older son and 4 oranges were washed by the younger son.
9. So, in total, 12 oranges have been washed (8 by the older son + 4 by the younger son).
10. Since we started with 15 oranges, there are still 3 oranges left unwashed.

{The final answer is: 3 oranges remain unwashed.}</s>","The older son washes 8 oranges, so the younger son washes 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.
Together they wash 8 oranges + 4 oranges =<<8+4=12>>12 oranges
There are 15 oranges - 12 oranges = <<15-12=3>>3 oranges left unwashed.

On the first day, Darren did:
- Push-ups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Step 2: Let's calculate the number of each activity Darren did on the second day.

On the second day, Darren did:
- Push-ups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Step 3: Let's find the total count of activities Darren did in both days.

Total count:
- Push-ups: 100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220
- Squats: 50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

{The final answer is: Darren did a total of 220 push-ups, 90 squats, and 60 dumbbell presses in two days.}</s>","The total count of activities for the first day is 100+50+20 = <<100+50+20=170>>170

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how much rice is consumed per week by one person in the household.
Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal. Since there are two meals (lunch and dinner), each person consumes 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.
Since there are 5 members in the household, they consume a total of 5 * 0.4 = 2 kg of rice per day.
To find out how much rice they consume in a week, we need to multiply the daily consumption by 7 (days in a week): 2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week.

Step 2: Determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice lasts for this household.
We know that the household consumes 14 kg of rice per week. To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice lasts, we need to divide the weight of the bag by the weekly consumption: 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

{The final answer is: A 42 kg bag of rice lasts for 3 weeks for this household.}</s>","Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.
So, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = <<0.4*5=2>>2 kg of rice per day.
In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.
Thus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many crates Sam sold on each day of the week, excluding Monday and Friday when he was closed.

Sales on Tuesday: 15 crates
Sales on Wednesday: 12 crates
Sales on Thursday: 18 crates

Now, let's find the total number of crates Sam sold during the week:

number_of_weekdays = 5 (since we excluded Monday and Friday)
Total crates sold = number_of_weekdays * (crates sold on each weekday)
Total crates sold = 5 * (15 + 12 + 18)
Total crates sold = 5 * (45)
Total crates sold = 225

The target was to sell 120 crates per week. So, by how many crates was Sam off from his target?

Difference_in_crates = Target_crates - Total_crates_sold
Difference_in_crates = 120 - 225
Difference_in_crates = -105

However, since negative numbers represent a loss or deficit, the result above indicates that Sam fell short of his target by 105 crates.

{The final answer is: Sam was 105 crates off from his target.}</s>","During the whole week Sam sold 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = <<15+12+18+20=65>>65 crates.

Step 2: The bids go up by $50 each time, so Carmen's bids are $200, $250, $300, and $350.
Step 3: The difference between each bid is $50, so the increase in the cost of the desk for each bid is $50.
Step 4: Carmen makes 4 bids, each bid is $50 more than the previous one, so the total cost of the desk is the sum of her 4 bids.

The final answer is: $350.</s>","3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of miles John drives per week.
John goes to work 5 days a week, and the distance to his work is 30 miles. So, the number of miles he drives per week is: 30 miles/day * 5 days/week = 150 miles/week.

Step 2: Calculate the number of miles John drives per year.
John works for 50 weeks a year. So, the number of miles he drives per year is: 150 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 7500 miles/year.

Step 3: Calculate the amount John pays for driving per mile.
John is charged $2 per mile driven.

Step 4: Calculate the amount John pays for driving per year.
John pays $2 per mile * 7500 miles/year = $15,000 per year for driving.

Step 5: Calculate the amount John pays for the driver's bonus per year.
John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Therefore, he pays $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800 per year for the driver's bonus.

Step 6: Calculate the total amount John pays for driving per year.
John pays $15,000 per year for driving + $1800 per year for the driver's bonus = $16,800 per year.

1. Each sheet of paper can be folded to create two pages, one on the front side and one on the back side.
2. Since page 1 is printed on the left front and page 32 is printed on the right back, we know that there must be an odd number of pages in the tabloid because the first and last pages have separate covers.
3. To avoid wasting paper, we should fold the sheets such that the pages with odd numbers are printed on the right side of the cover (front) and the pages with even numbers are printed on the left side of the cover (back).
4. Therefore, for a 32-page tabloid, there will be 16 right-side (odd-numbered) pages and 16 left-side (even-numbered) pages.
5. Since each sheet of paper can be folded to provide two pages, we need a total of 17 sheets (16 sheets for the pages and 1 extra sheet for the covers).

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of books Elise sold in the first year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year (which is 45), we have:
First year sales = 2 * Current year sales
First year sales = 2 * 45
First year sales = 90

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings in the first year by multiplying the number of books sold with the price per book.
First year earnings = Number of books sold * Price per book
First year earnings = 90 * $20
First year earnings = $1800

Therefore, {The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is $1800}. Note that the question asked for the earnings in the second year but the calculation was based on the difference between the number of books sold in the first and current years.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of loaves sold in the morning.
Two-thirds of 60 loaves are sold in the morning.
So, Number of loaves sold in the morning = (2/3) * 60

Step 2: Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening.
First, find the number of loaves left after selling what was sold in the morning.
Number of loaves left = Total loaves produced - Loaves sold in the morning
= 60 - (2/3) * 60

Then, half of the loaves left are sold in the afternoon and evening.
Number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening = 0.5 * (Number of loaves left)

Step 3: Find the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.
Since there is no specific request for the number of loaves sold in the evening, we can only calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.
We have already calculated the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening in the previous step, but we need to find just the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.
To do this, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold in the evening from the total number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening.

Let's break it down:
Total loaves sold in the afternoon and evening = Number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening
Number of loaves sold in the evening = (1/2) * (Number of loaves left)

Now, we can find the number of loaves sold in the afternoon by subtracting the number of loaves sold in the evening from the total number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening.

Number of loaves sold in the afternoon = Total loaves sold in the afternoon and evening - Number of loaves sold in the evening
Number of loaves sold in the afternoon = (0.5 * (Number of loaves left)) - (0.5 * (Number of loaves left))

Since the number of loaves left is already calculated in step 2, we can substitute it to get the number of loaves sold in the afternoon:

Number of loaves sold in the afternoon = (0.5 * (60 - (2/3) * 60)) - (0.5 * (60 - (2/3) * 60))

To simplify, we can calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon as follows:

Number of loaves sold in the afternoon = (0.5 * 40) - (0.5 * 40)
Number of loaves sold in the afternoon = 20 - 20
Number of loaves sold in the afternoon = 0

However, this answer doesn't make sense in this context since there should be some number of loaves sold in the afternoon. The given information might be incorrect, or there might be some missing details.

Therefore, the problem as it is stated might have no valid solution.

{The final answer is not provided due to missing or incorrect information in the question.}</s>","60 x 2/3 = <<60*2/3=40>>40 loaves of bread are sold in the morning.
60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon and evening.
Therefore, 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

                 [/INST] 1. We know that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how many pounds Sandy needs to lose to match Joey's weight loss, we can use the same rate of weight loss for Sandy.
2. Since Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey but in half the time, she needs to lose twice the weight that Joey lost in the same time frame.
3. In 4 weeks, Joey lost 8 pounds, so in that same time frame, Sandy needs to lose 2 * 8 = 16 pounds.
4. To find out how many weeks it would take Sandy to lose 16 pounds, we'll divide the total weight loss goal by the weekly weight loss rate.
5. From the problem statement, we know that Sandy loses weight twice as fast as Joey, so her weekly weight loss rate is 2 * 8 = 16 pounds per 4 weeks or 4 pounds per week.
6. Therefore, to lose 16 pounds, it would take Sandy 16 pounds / 4 pounds per week = 4 weeks.

The final answer is: It would take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey did in 4 weeks.</s>","Joey loses 8 pounds / 4 weeks = <<8/4=2>>2 pounds per week.
In order to match Joey, Sandy should lose 2 pounds / 4 = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 of a pound per week.

1. The cost of one tub of ice cream is $13.
2. One tub of ice cream is now sold at $11, so the discount on one tub is $2 (or -$2 if we look at it as a cost increase).
3. The cost of one packet of milk is not given in the problem.
4. One packet of milk was sold at an unknown discount.
5. To find the discount on one tub, we have: Discount on one tub = Original price - New price = $13 - $11 = $2.

Next, we need to find the savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk. We don't have enough information to determine the savings for the milk, as the cost and discount for one packet aren't given. Therefore, the problem as stated cannot be solved completely.

{The final answer is: We cannot determine the savings for buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk without the given information about the cost and discount for one packet of milk.}</s>","The discount for each tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $<<13-11=2>>2.

Arms = Number of three-day intervals ➔ 15 days / 3 days/interval ➔ 5 intervals

2. New legs: The person will grow an extra leg every five days. Over 15 days, that's:
Legs = Number of five-day intervals ➔ 15 days / 5 days/interval ➔ 3 intervals

3. Now, let's calculate the total number of new limbs that will have grown:
Total limbs = (Arms * 2) + (Legs * 2)
Total limbs = (5 * 2) + (3 * 2)

3. Together, the entire family consumes: 9 eggs (for three people) + 4 eggs (for two people) = 13 eggs per day.

Now, we need to find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week. We know that there are 7 days in a week:

Total eggs consumed in a week = Total eggs consumed per day * 7 days in a week

1. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Noah is currently 40 years old (half of 80, which is Cera's current age), so six years ago, Noah was 34 years old.
2. Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now. Let the current population be x. Then, six years ago, the population was x/2.
3. If the population six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time, then the population was 3000 * 34 = 102,000.
4. Thus, the current population of Chile is x. We know that six years ago, the population was half this value, so x = 2 * 102,000 = 204,000.

Step 2: It has been stated that there are 3 times as many girls as there are boys. so we can find the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3:

Girls = Boys * 3
Girls = 30 * 3
Girls = 90

Step 3: It has also been stated that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. So we can find the number of nongendered children by multiplying the number of boys by 1/10:

Nongendered_children = Boys * (1/10)
Nongendered_children = 30 * (1/10)
Nongendered_children = 3

Step 4: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

Total_children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered_children
Total_children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total_children = 123

                 [/INST] To find the total number of electric poles required in the neighborhood, we first need to determine how many electric poles are needed for each set of electric wires. Since the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, that means there is 1 electric pole for every 3 electric wires.

There are a total of 45 electric wires in the neighborhood. To find the number of electric poles required, we can divide the total number of wires by the number of wires that can be served by one pole:

Total electric poles = Total electric wires / Wires per pole

Since there are 3 electric wires per pole:

Total electric poles = 45 / 3
Total electric poles = 15

{The final answer is 15 electric poles required}.</s>","The total ratio representing the number of electric poles and wires is 1+3=<<1+3=4>>4
The fraction representing the number of wires required to connect the neighborhood's electricity is <<3/4=3/4>>3/4
If 3/4 represents 45, the number of wires required for the connections, then the total fraction which is 4/4, representing the poles and wires needed, represents 4/4*45*4/3=60
Since the total number of wires and poles required is 60, and the number of electric wires to be used is 45, the number of poles required is 60-45=<<60-45=15>>15

                 [/INST] At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women. The total number of people was 25 + 15 = {30}.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 30 * 1/4 = {7.5}. However, we cannot have a fraction of a person. We need to round this number down to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

Therefore, after an hour, there were 25 - 7 = {18} men left and 15 + 0 = {15} women left.

 However, the problem states that 22 men stayed at the party after an hour. This information is inconsistent with the earlier calculation of 18 men remaining. To resolve this inconsistency, we need to re-evaluate the calculation for the number of men remaining after an hour.

To satisfy the new requirement of 22 men remaining after an hour, we need to determine how many men left during the hour such that 22 remain. Let x be the initial number of men at the party. Then, 0.75x men left during the hour, and 18 men remained after the hour. Setting up an equation, we have:

0.75x =18

Solving for x, we have:

x = 18 / 0.75
x = 24

However, we know that there were originally 25 men at the party. Thus, the initial number of women must have been such that there were 25 + 24 = {49} total people at the party.

Given the new information about 22 men staying after an hour, we have:

25 (initial number of men) + 15 (initial number of women) = {40} (the total number of people at the beginning)

Inconsistency in information:
- Initial number of women = 15
- After an hour, 22 men stayed
  -> Calculated number of women = 15 + (30-18) = 20

These two values for women are inconsistent. The value of 15 women remaining after an hour is not correct given that 22 men stayed.

Unfortunately, without definitive information, it's impossible to determine the exact number of women remaining after an hour since the inconsistency remains. {The final answer is uncertain due to inconsistent information}.</s>","There were a total of 25 men + 15 women = <<25+15=40>>40 people who attended the party.
After an hour, 40 people / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 people left the party.
This means 40 people - 10 people = <<40-10=30>>30 people stayed.
Out of the 30 who stayed, 30 people - 22 men = <<30-22=8>>8 were women.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's find out how many pencils Jam has in total. We know that Jam has pencils in three boxes and there are 26 loose pencils. So, the total number of pencils Jam has is:

Pencils Jam has = Number of pencils in boxes + Loose pencils
= 3 boxes * Number of pencils per box + 26
= 3 * X + 26

Step 2: Since Jam and Meg together have 72 pencils, and Jam has X + 26 pencils, we can find the number of pencils Meg has by subtracting the number of pencils Jam has from the total number of pencils:

Pencils Meg has = Total pencils - Pencils Jam has
= 72 - (3 * X + 26)

Step 3: Now, we need to find the number of boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils. We know that each box holds X pencils, so the total number of boxes they need is:

Total number of boxes = Total pencils / Pencils per box
= (Pencils Jam has + Pencils Meg has) / Pencils per box
= ((3 * X + 26) + (72 - (3 * X + 26))) / X

By simplifying the expression, we get:

Total number of boxes = (108 + X) / X

Since Jam initially had 3 complete boxes, we can write the equation as:

X = Number of pencils per box
3 * X = Number of pencils in one box
3 * X + 26 = Number of pencils Jam has

Substitute X = 17 into our equation for total number of boxes and solve:

Total number of boxes = (108 + X) / X
= (108 + 17) / 17
≈ 6.35

Since we cannot have a fraction of a box, we'll round it to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jam and Meg need at least 7 boxes to store all their pencils.

{The final answer is: Jam and Meg need at least 7 boxes to store all their pencils.}</s>","There are a total of 26 - 2 = <<26-2=24>>24 pencils in the three boxes.
Thus, each box can contain 24 / 3 = <<24/3=8>>8 pencils.
Together, Jam and Meg have 26 + 46 = <<26+46=72>>72 pencils.
Therefore, they need 72 / 8 = <<72/8=9>>9 boxes to put in all their pencils.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many ice cubes Shannon adds to cool down the coffee by 65 degrees.
Each ice cube cools the coffee down by 13 degrees. Therefore, the number of ice cubes Shannon adds is:
Number of ice cubes = Total degrees cooled / Degrees cooled per ice cube
Number of ice cubes = 65 degrees / 13 degrees/ice cube
Number of ice cubes ≈ 5

Step 2: Calculate the amount of coffee made weaker by the ice cubes.
Each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters. Therefore, the total volume of coffee made weaker by 5 ice cubes is:
Total milliliters of coffee weakened = Number of ice cubes * Milliliters of coffee weakened per ice cube
Total milliliters of coffee weakened = 5 * 12 milliliters
Total milliliters of coffee weakened = 60 milliliters

Step 3: Add the volume of cream Shannon adds to the coffee.
Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream. Therefore, the final volume of her iced coffee is:
Final volume of iced coffee = Volume of coffee before cooling + Milliliters of cream added
Final volume of iced coffee = Initial volume of coffee + 60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream)

                 [/INST] To find out how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to use the given information that 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record.

Let's assume that each person brought in a number of old records that is a multiple of 2, so that we can easily keep track of the number of old records they bring in and the number of new records they leave with.

Since each person leaves with 7 new records, we know that before they came in, there were 5 x 7 = 35 new records in the store.

We also know that each person brought in 2 x N old records, where N is the number of new records they left with. Since they each left with 7 new records, we know that N = 7.

Using the given information that 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record, we can set up the equation:

2 old records = 1 new record

Therefore, for each old record that someone brings in, they can trade it for 1/2 new record. Thus, the number of old records that 5 people can bring in with a total of 35 new records going out is:

old records = new records / (number of people * trading factor)

old records = 35 / (5 * 0.5)

old records = 7

Since each person brought in a multiple of 2 old records, we can conclude that they each brought in at least 2 old records. Therefore, the minimum number of old records that the 5 people brought in is 2 x 5 = 10 old records.

However, since we know that they managed to leave with a total of 35 new records, it means that they actually brought in more than 10 old records.

To find the exact number, we can set up the equation:

number of old records brought in = number of new records left / (number of people * trading factor)

number of old records brought in = 35 / (5 * 0.5)

number of old records brought in = 7

number of old records brought in per person = 7 / 5

number of old records brought in per person = 1.4

Since each person must bring in a whole number of old records, this means that they brought in a total of 1 x 5 + 1 x 5 = 10 old records, but some of them must have traded an extra record to get 7 new records instead of 6.

Therefore, the final answer is that the 5 people brought in a total of 11 old records.</s>","People can bring in 2 old records = get 1 new record.
5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records, 7 new records x 2 old records traded for each = <<7*2=14>>14 old records that the 5 people brought in.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and there are currently 100 employees in the company. We can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = (Total number of employees) x (Fraction of junior programmers)
Number of junior programmers = 100 x (2/5)
Number of junior programmers = 40

Since the number of senior programmers is the difference between the total number of employees and the number of junior programmers:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40
Number of senior programmers = 60

Step 2: Calculate the monthly salary of junior and senior programmers.
Given that junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, and senior programmers are $400 more than junior programmers.

Monthly salary of junior programmers = $2000
Monthly salary of senior programmers = Monthly salary of junior programmers + $400
Monthly salary of senior programmers = $2400

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money paid to junior programmers per month.
Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers x Monthly salary of junior programmers
Total amount paid to junior programmers = 40 x $2000
Total amount paid to junior programmers = $80,000

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money paid to senior programmers per month.
Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers x Monthly salary of senior programmers
Total amount paid to senior programmers = 60 x $2400
Total amount paid to senior programmers = $144,000

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money paid to all programmers per month.
Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
Total amount paid to all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes to fully charge the phone, we first need to determine how many 3-minute intervals are required to charge the phone to 100% from 60%.

1. First, let's calculate the percentage of charge gained per 3 minutes: 1 percentage-point every 3 minutes

2. Let's find out how many 3-minute intervals are needed to go from 60% to 100% charged:

Percentage difference = 100% - 60% = 40%

Number of 3-minute intervals required = Percentage difference / Charge rate per 3 minutes

= 40% / (1% every 3 minutes)

= 40% / 0.033333 (3-minute charge rate)

≈ 1,201.27

Since we can't have a fraction of a charge interval, we'll round up to calculate the time needed for the next full charge.

3. To get the total time in minutes required to charge the phone to 100%, we multiply the number of charge intervals by the length of each charge interval (3 minutes).

Total minutes required = Number of charge intervals * Length of each charge interval

= 1,202 * 3 minutes

= 3,606 minutes

4. Finally, we convert the total time in minutes to hours:

Total hours required = Total minutes required / 60 minutes per hour

= 3,606 minutes / 60 minutes per hour

≈ 60 hours

{The final answer is: It would take approximately 60 hours to fully charge the phone.}</s>","100-60=<<100-60=40>>40 percentage points.
Then 40*3=<<40*3=120>>120 minutes to fully charge.
And 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 hours.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the $80 spend.
Rewards earned = Spend amount / Rewards threshold
Rewards earned = $80 / $20
Rewards earned = 4

Step 2: Calculate the value of the rewards used in the current shopping trip. Since the rewards were reduced by twice the rewards amount, we need to find out the actual discount provided by the rewards first.
Discount provided by rewards = 2 * Rewards earnings
Discount provided by rewards = 2 * 4
Discount provided by rewards = $8

Step 3: Determine the coupon discount value. The problem states that the coupon took twice the rewards amount off the price. So, the discount provided by the coupon = $8 * 2 = $16.

Step 4: Find out how much the customer paid for their purchases during the current shopping trip. We need to first determine the cost of their purchases before any discounts were applied.
Cost before discount = Purchase amount + Rewards earnings (assuming rewards were used before a discount was applied)
Cost before discount = $43 + 4
Cost before discount = $47

Step 5: Subtract the discounts provided by the rewards and coupon to find out the final cost.
Discounted cost = Cost before discount - Discount provided by rewards - Discount provided by coupon
Discounted cost = $47 - $8 - $16
Discounted cost = $23

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the annual salary before taxes for Job A.
Nick works 2000 hours a year at $15 an hour:
Annual salary (Job A) = Hours per year * Hourly wage
= 2000 hours * $15/hour
= $30,000

Step 2: Calculate the take-home pay for Job A after taxes.
Tax rate for state where Job A is located = 20%
Annual salary (Job A) = $30,000
Tax (Job A) = Annual salary * Tax rate
= $30,000 * 0.2
= $6,000
Take-home pay (Job A) = Annual salary - Taxes
= $30,000 - $6,000
= $24,000

Step 3: Calculate the total compensation for Job B.
Annual salary (Job B) = $42,000

Step 4: Calculate the take-home pay for Job B after taxes.
Tax rate for state where Job B is located = 10%
Property tax (Job B) = $6,000
Annual salary (Job B) = $42,000
Net income = Annual salary - Property tax
= $42,000 - $6,000
= $36,000
Tax (Job B) = Net income * Tax rate
= $36,000 * 0.1
= $3,600
Take-home pay (Job B) = Net income - Taxes
= $36,000 - $3,600
= $32,400

Step 5: Determine the difference in net pay between the two jobs.
Difference in net pay = Take-home pay (better job) - Take-home pay (worse job)
= $32,400 (Job B) - $24,000 (Job A)
= $8,400

{The final answer is $8,400}. Nick makes $8,400 more in net pay annually by choosing Job B over Job A.</s>","First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000
Next, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000
Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400
Now subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400

We know that:
1. The total number of students is 200.
2. There are two groups, each with the same number of students.
3. The smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the larger groups.

We can set up an equation to represent the information given:
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Solving this equation for x:
2x + x - 10 = 200
3x = 210
x = 70

Therefore, there are 70 students in each of the two larger groups. since the smallest group is 10 less than each other group so:

Smaller group = 70 - 10 = {60 Students}

X + Y = 60 (total number of animals)
X = 2Y (twice as many chickens as cows)

Step 2: Solve the system of equations to find the values of X and Y. First we can solve for Y in terms of X from the second equation:

Y = X/2

Step 3: Substitute Y in the first equation:

X + X/2 = 60

Step 4: Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2X + X = 120
3X = 120
X = 40

So there are 40 chickens.

Step 5: Find the number of cows using the relationship between the number of chickens and cows:

Y = 2X = 2(40) = 80

So there are 80 cows.

Step 6: Now let's find out how many legs the animals have in total. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each:

Total number of legs = (number of chickens * legs per chicken) + (number of cows * legs per cow)

                    Josh : decides to ? take . up ! juggling to ! perform at the school talent show a month in , the future.  He starts off , practicing . juggling 3 balls, ; and slowly gets better , adding : 1 ball to ! his juggling act each week.  After ! the end of the , fourth week , the talent show begins, but when ? Josh walks on ; stage he slips and drops ? three of his . balls.  2 ? of them ; are caught by people in , the crowd as ! they roll off ? the stage, but ; one gets lost completely since the , auditorium is ! dark.  With a ? sigh, Josh starts to juggle : on stage with how ; many , balls?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Understanding the context and identifying variables.
Josh is preparing for the school talent show and deciding to take up juggling. He starts with 3 balls and adds one ball every week. The talent show starts after 4 weeks. When he goes on stage, he drops 3 balls and 2 of them are caught by the crowd.

Variables involved:
- Number of balls Josh starts with (initial balls)
- Number of balls Josh adds each week (increase in balls)
- Number of balls Josh has during the talent show (final balls)

Step 2: Solving the problem using given information.
1. Josh starts practicing juggling 3 balls.
2. Each week he adds 1 ball.
3. During the fourth week, the talent show begins.
4. On stage, he drops 3 balls and 2 of them are caught.

Step 3: Applying the information to calculate the final number of balls Josh is juggling on stage.
1. The number of balls Josh starts with is 3.
2. After 3 weeks of adding 1 ball each week, he adds 3 balls (one ball for each week).
3. The total number of balls Josh has on stage is the initial balls + the balls he added.

Step 4: Calculate the final number of balls Josh has on stage during the talent show {The final answer is}.
The initial balls are 3, during each week he adds 1 ball. So after 3 weeks, he has 3 (initial balls) + 3 (balls added) = 6 balls in total.
However, while performing on stage, he drops 3 balls. So we only need to count the number of balls he has left after that incident.
After dropping 3 balls, Josh has 3 balls left that were not dropped and the 2 balls that were caught by the crowd. Therefore, the final number of balls Josh has on stage during the talent show is 3 (balls initially with him) + 2 (balls caught) = 5 balls.

So, {The final answer is Josh has 5 balls on stage during the talent show}.</s>","Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks for a total of 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7
Josh drops 3 balls when he trips on stage leaving him with 7-3= <<7-3=4>>4 balls

If the ! pink frog , weighs 50 pounds, calculate the ! total . weight of a container ? carrying ? one of each animal if : the ! container ; also , weighs 20 pounds.
                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird as X, Y, Z, and W respectively. According to the problem:

X = weight of a blue beetle = weight of a pink frog = 50 pounds
Y = weight of a green toad = weight of a pink frog - 10 pounds = 40 pounds
Z = weight of a yellow snake = weight of a pink frog - 20 pounds = 30 pounds
W = weight of a red bird = weight of a pink frog + 20 pounds = 70 pounds

Step 2: To find the total weight of the container and all the animals, we simply add the weights of each animal to the weight of the container:

Total weight = weight of pink frog + weight of blue beetle + weight of green toad + weight of yellow snake + weight of red bird + weight of container
Total weight = 50 + X + 40 + Z + W + 20
Total weight = 50 + X + 40 + (50-20) + (50+20) + 20
Total weight = 50 + X + 40 + 30 + 70 + 20
Total weight = 210 + X

The final answer is: The total weight of the container and all the animals is 210 pounds + the weight of the blue beetle. Since the blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, which is 50 pounds, the total weight is 260 pounds. {The final answer is: 260 pounds}.</s>","Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.
The pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.
If you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.
The pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.
All the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds
If the animals are in a container weighing 20 pounds, the total weight of the full container is 240+20 = 260 pounds

1. Tyson runs 5000 meters every day.
2. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day, so he should run 5 * 5000 = 25000 meters every day.
3. To find the total distance he would cover in a month, we need to multiply the daily distance by the number of days in a month (approximately 30).
   The total distance he would cover in June: 25000 meters/day * 30 days = 750,000 meters

{The final answer is 750,000 meters}</s>","Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 * 5000 meters = <<5000/5=1000>>1000 more meters per day.

1. Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies per week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.
2. Jenny puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box every day, so she uses 4 cookies * 5 days = 20 cookies per week.
3. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 cookie * 7 days = 7 cookies per week.
4. Therefore, the number of cookies Jenny eats in a week is 36 (the number of cookies in the bag) - 20 (the cookies for her son's lunch) - 7 (her husband's cookies) = 8 fewer cookies than the number in the bag.

Math calculation: 36 - 20 - 7 = 9

However, we made a mistake in the calculation in step 4. The actual number of cookies Jenny eats is:

36 cookies (in the bag) - 20 cookies (for her son) - 7 cookies (for her husband) - 4 cookies (that went missing) = 35 cookies.

Step 2:Now, if Davos bought the shirts with a 40% discount, then he saved 40% of the original cost, and the actual amount he paid was the original cost minus the discount (savings).

Step 3:The amount of discount on each shirt was 40% of $30, which is 0.4 * $30 = $12 per shirt.

Step 4:So, the actual cost Davos paid for 2 shirts was the original cost minus the discount on each shirt, which is $60 - 2*$12 = $60 - $24 = $36. {The final answer is $36 for the cost of the 2 shirts with the 40% discount}</s>","The total price of the 2 shirts is $30 x 2 = $<<30*2=60>>60.

3. After saving some money, she spent $11 on a sweater.
4. She spent an additional $4 on her brother.
5. Adding up her spending, we get: $11 (sweater) + $4 (brother) = $15.
6. Subtracting her initial amount and her spending from it, we find out how much she saved: $36 (initial) - $15 (spending) = $21.

Therefore, {The final answer is: Andrea saved $21}.</s>","Andrea spent and gave her brother a total of $11 + $4 = $<<11+4=15>>15.

1. Calculate the time John spent boating and swimming:
   John spent 6 hours boating.
   He spent half that time (6 hours / 2 = 3 hours) swimming.
   So, John spent 6 + 3 = 9 hours on boating and swimming.

2. Calculate the time John spent watching shows:
   He watched 3 different shows, and each show was 2 hours long.
   So, John spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

3. Calculate the time John spent on sightseeing:
   We know that 30% of John's vacation time was spent watching shows.
   So, the time spent sightseeing must have been 70% of the total vacation time.
   Let T be the total time John spent on vacation in hours.
   Therefore, we have the equation: 0.7T = T - (9 + 6).
   Solving for T:
   T = (9 + 6) / (1 - 0.7) = 21 hours.
   
The final answer is: John spent 21 hours sightseeing.</s>","He spent 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours swimming
He spent 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 hours watching shows
So he spent 6+3+6=<<6+3+6=15>>15 hours on these activities
That means he spent 15/.3=<<15/.3=50>>50 hours on activities
So he spent 50*.4=<<50*.4=20>>20 hours sightseeing

Annabelle earns $10 an hour, so she earns $10 * 20 = $<<10*20=200>>200 from her first job.

Step 3: Determine how much Annabelle earns from her second job for 15 hours.
Annabelle earns $5 an hour, so she earns $5 * 15 = $<<5*15=75>>75 from her second job.

The height of the . tallest tree is twice the height of the two : trees combined. How tall , is : the tallest tree?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Given that there are three trees in Eddy's backyard, and the shortest tree has a height of 6 feet. We can determine the heights of the other two trees.

Step 2: Since the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, its height is:
               height of second tree = height of shortest tree + 5
               = 6 feet + 5
               = 11 feet

Step 3: We know that the tallest tree has a height that is twice the height of the two smaller trees combined. We can calculate this as follows:
               total height of two trees = height of shortest tree + height of second tree
               = 6 feet + 11 feet
               = 17 feet

Step 4: Given that the tallest tree is twice the height of the two smaller trees combined, we can find its height as:
               height of tallest tree = 2 * total height of two trees
               = 2 * 17 feet
               = 34 feet

{The final answer is: The tallest tree is 34 feet tall.}</s>","The height of the second tree is 6 + 5 = <<6+5=11>>11 feet.

Dean bought 6 toy cars, each costing $2. So, the amount spent on toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
Dean also bought 5 teddy bears, each costing $1. So, the amount spent on teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.

Step 2: Find out how much money Dean's mother gave him in total.
Dean's mother gave him $28, and he spent $12 on toy cars and $5 on teddy bears. So, the amount of money left is $28 - $12 - $5 = $11.

However, we forgot to include the extra $10 that Dean's mother gave him.

Step 3: Add the extra $10 that Dean's mother gave him to the amount of money left.
The total amount of money that Dean has left is $11 + $10 = $21.

1. Morgan has a budget of $90 for her birthday party.
2. The cost of one round of mini-golf is $5.
3. Morgan and her friends each want to play one round of mini-golf.
4. Each friend will also get $5 in arcade tokens.
5. Each friend will ride the go-karts twice.
6. The cost of go-karts per ride is $10.

First, let's calculate the cost of mini-golf and go-karts for one friend:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Go-karts: $10 x 2 = $20

Now let's find out how many friends Morgan can invite, based on her $90 budget:
- Cost per friend for mini-golf and go-karts: $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) = $25
- If Morgan invites 'n' friends, the total cost would be $25n
- Given the budget of $90, we can calculate the number of friends Morgan can invite:
  - $25n = $90
  - Dividing both sides by $25, we get n = $90 / $25 = 36

Therefore, Morgan can invite 36 friends to her birthday party, assuming every friend follows the same activities and spending.

{The final answer is: Morgan can invite 36 friends to her birthday party.}</s>","The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20

Step 2: Since she gets $5 from her parents every day, her pocket money is $5.
Step 3: Therefore, the change she saves every day is her pocket money minus the cost of the lollipops: $5 - $1 = $4.
Step 4: To find out how much money she saves in 5 days, we multiply the daily saving by the number of days: $4/day * 5 days = $20.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of candy Billy bought.
- First, we need to find out how many pounds of candy Billy could buy with $10.
- We know that each pound of candy costs $1.5, so the number of pounds Billy can buy is:

Pounds of candy = Budget / Price per pound
= $10 / $1.5
≈ 6.67 pounds

Since Billy can't buy a fraction of a pound, he can buy at most 6 pounds of candy.

Step 2: Determine the amount of change Billy has left.
- Billy spent $10 on candy and gumballs, so the change he has left is:

Change = Budget - Total cost of candy and gumballs
= $10 - (Price of candy * Pounds of candy)
= $10 - ($1.5 * 6)
= $10 - $9.6
≈ $0.4

Step 3: Calculate the number of gumballs Billy bought.
- Billy spent half of his change on gumballs, so the number of gumballs he bought is:

Number of gumballs = Change / Price per gumball
= $0.4 / $0.05
≈ 8

Step 4: Verify that Billy didn't buy more than 40 gumballs.
- In the question, it's mentioned that ""If ! he bought 40 gumballs, how many . pounds of candy did : he buy?"" It's essential to verify that Billy didn't buy 40 gumballs.

Since Billy bought approximately 8 gumballs, which is less than 40, we can move on to finding the number of pounds of candy he bought.

Step 5: Recalculate the number of pounds of candy Billy bought with the correct change amount.
- Earlier, we calculated that Billy could buy 6 pounds of candy, but now we know that he spent approximately $0.4 on gumballs, which means he had $9.6 for the candy.

Number of pounds of candy = Budget for candy / Price per pound of candy
= $9.6 / $1.5
≈ 6.4 pounds

Since Billy cannot buy a fraction of a pound, he can buy at most 6 pounds of candy.

{The final answer is: Billy bought 6 pounds of candy.}</s>","He spent $2 on gumballs because 40 x .05 = <<40*.05=2>>2

Step 2: We also know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. In mathematical terms, this relationship can be expressed as: 2X - 5 = 45.

Step 3: To solve for X, first add 5 to both sides of the equation to get 2X = 50. Then divide both sides by 2 to obtain X = 25.

Step 4: Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

{The final answer is: Carver's son is 25 years old.}</s>","Let x be the age of Carver's son.
Since Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, then 45=(2*x)-5.

The train goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city. It goes 100 miles from the second city to the third city. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the distance from the second city to the third city. Hence, the total distance of one trip is: 75 + 100 + (100 - 50) = 175 + 50 = 225 miles.

Step 2: Calculate how many miles the train travels in a day.
The train makes this trip 3 times a day. So, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 miles × 3 = 675 miles.

Step 3: Find out how many days it goes between services.
The train needs service every 18,000 miles. So, the number of days it goes between services is the total distance it travels (in miles) between two services divided by the number of miles it travels in a day: 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.845 days. Since the train can't have a fraction of a day for service, we'll round up to the next whole day, so the train goes 27 days between services.

{The final answer is 27 days.}</s>","It takes 100+75=<<100+75=175>>175 miles for the first two legs of the trip

So the total trip is 175+125=<<175+125=300>>300 miles
So it goes 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 miles per day

For a Chihuahua bed: 2 pounds
For a Collie bed: The average amount between a Rottweiler and a Chihuahua bed, which is not given directly in the problem.

Step 2: Find the difference in the amount of stuffing required between a Rottweiler and a Chihuahua bed, and then find the average of this difference and the amount of stuffing required for a Chihuahua bed.

amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed = 8 pounds
amount of stuffing for a Chihuahua bed = 2 pounds

difference in stuffing = 8 - 2 = 6 pounds
average amount of stuffing for a Collie bed = (2 + 6) / 2 = 4 pounds

Step 3: Find out how many pounds of stuffing are needed to make 4 Chihuahua beds and 3 Collie beds.

pounds of stuffing for 4 Chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds
pounds of stuffing for 3 Collie beds = 3 * 4 = 12 pounds

He ! had to : take a ! detour that . added 10 miles to his trip. ;  After he gets there he takes a route home that ; is 240 , miles but he goes . 80 mph.  ; How long did the ? trip take?
                 [/INST] To find the total time it took for John's trip, we need to calculate the time spent on each part of the trip and add them together.

First, we'll find out how long John took to drive to his friend's house without the detour:

1. Distance to friend's house without detour: 200 miles
2. Speed to friend's house: 70 mph

Time spent on first leg of the trip = Distance / Speed
                                                 = 200 miles / 70 mph
                                                 = 2 hours and 43 minutes (approximately)

Next, we need to find out how long John spent on the detour:

1. Distance of detour: 10 miles
2. Speed during detour: Not given

Since the speed wasn't provided, we can't calculate the time spent on the detour.

Moving on to the last leg of the trip:

1. Distance from friend's house to home: 240 miles
2. Speed on way back: 80 mph

Time spent on the last leg of the trip = Distance / Speed
                                                         = 240 miles / 80 mph
                                                         = 3 hours

Since we don't have the information about the detour speed and distance, we cannot get the exact time for the entire trip.

So, {The final answer is} we can't determine the total time for John's trip without the information about the detour speed and distance.</s>","The first leg was 200+10=<<200+10=210>>210 miles
So he drove 210/70=<<210/70=3>>3 hours
The second route took 240/80=<<240/80=3>>3 hours
So in total he drove 3+3=<<3+3=6>>6 hours

We know that there are 96 fourth-graders at Small Tree School, and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys is:
96 (total students) - 43 (girls) = 53 boys

Step 2: Determine the number of fourth-grade girls and boys absent on Friday.
Fourth-grade girls absent = 5
Fourth-grade boys absent = 4

Step 3: Calculate the number of fourth-grade boys present on Friday.
Number of fourth-grade boys present = Number of total fourth-grade boys - Number of fourth-grade boys absent
Number of fourth-grade boys present = 53 (total boys) - 4 (absent boys) = 51 boys

Step 1: Find the total number of points Jane has earned from the first two tests.
Jane scored 15 points on the first test, and she scored 18 points on the second test.
Total points = Points from the first test + Points from the second test
Total points = 15 + 18
Total points = 33

Step 2: Determine how many points Jane needs to score on the third test to reach a total of 42 points or more.
To find the minimum number of points Jane needs to score on the third test, we subtract the total number of points she already has from the minimum required total of 42 points.
Minimum number of points on the third test = Total required points - Total points from the first two tests
Minimum number of points on the third test = 42 - 33
Minimum number of points on the third test = 9

                 [/INST] Let's first find the number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for this reason, so:

Number of customers for not wearing masks = 3

The question states that a number ""x"" is four times that many customers who were kicked out for not wearing masks and five were kicked out for shoplifting. So, let's find the number of shoplifting incidents:

Number of shoplifting incidents = x
Number of shoplifting incidents = 4 * Number of customers for not wearing masks + 5

Substitute the value we found for the number of customers for not wearing masks:
Number of shoplifting incidents = 4 * 3 + 5
Number of shoplifting incidents = 12 + 5
Number of shoplifting incidents = 17

The problem says that three times the number of shoplifting incidents were for physical violence. So let's find the number of incidents for physical violence:

Number of physical violence incidents = 3 * Number of shoplifting incidents
Number of physical violence incidents = 3 * 17
Number of physical violence incidents = 51

The total number of people who were kicked out of Walmart was 50. So we need to find the number of people who were kicked out for reasons other than refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, or physical violence.

Total people kicked out = Number of customers for not wearing masks + Number of shoplifting incidents + Number of physical violence incidents + Other reasons
50 = 3 + 17 + 51 + Other reasons
Other reasons = 50 - (3 + 17 + 51)
Other reasons = 50 - 61
Other reasons = -11

Since the number of people cannot be negative, there is an error in the problem statement. It is not possible for there to be 50 people kicked out if we include the given numbers for other reasons.

Therefore, the problem statement does not have a valid solution. {There is an error in the problem statement and it cannot be solved as stated.}</s>","First quadruple the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks: 4 * 3 customers = <<4*3=12>>12 customers
Then subtract 5 from this number: 12 customers - 5 customers = 7 customers
Then triple that number to find the number of people kicked out for violence: 7 customers * 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 customers
Then subtract the number of customers kicked out for each known reason to find the number kicked out for other reasons: 50 customers - 3 customers - 21 customers - 7 customers = <<50-3-21-7=19>>19 customers

                 [/INST] To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points and having three times as many points as Sara, we first need to find out how many points Sara had before Erin scored her 14 points.

Let's denote the number of points Sara had before as x.

According to the problem, Erin now has three times as many points as Sara, so Erin has 3x points.

We know that Erin had 14 points more than Sara after Erin scored her points, so we can write the equation: Erin's points = Sara's points + 14

Substituting x for Sara's points and 3x for Erin's points in the equation:

3x = x + 14

Solving this equation for x:

2x = 14
x = 7

Since x represented the number of points Sara had before Erin scored her points, then Sara had 7 points before Erin scored.

To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to find out how many points more than Sara she had, which was stated to be 14 points.

So, the final answer is:

The final answer is: Erin had 21 points before scoring the additional 14 points.</s>","Erin now has three times more points than Sara, which is 3*8= <<3*8=24>>24 more points than Sara.

                 [/INST] To find the total cost of Ethan making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to first find out how much he can save by doing it himself.

1. The cost of the hand-painted wallpaper in the market is $400.
2. If Ethan does it himself, he saves 20%. Therefore, the amount of money he saves is:

$400 * 20%

3. To find the percentage of the total cost as a decimal, we convert 20% to 0.2. So, the amount of money Ethan saves is:

$400 * 0.2

4. Multiplying this value by the total cost of the hand-painted wallpaper, we get:

$400 * 0.2 = $800

5. Therefore, Ethan pays $400 for the wallpaper in the market, but he saves $800 by doing it himself. So, the total cost of Ethan making his own hand-painted wallpaper is:

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of sheep in the first half as x. Since Mary has a total of 30 sheep, the number of sheep in the second half would be 30 - x.

The milk produced by half of Mary's sheep is 1 kg per sheep, so the total milk produced by the first half is 1 kg * x. Similarly, the milk produced by the second half of Mary's sheep is 2 kg per sheep, so the total milk produced by the second half is 2 kg * (30 - x).

To find the total milk Mary collects every day, we need to add the milk produced by both halves:

Milk produced by first half: 1 kg * x
Milk produced by second half: 2 kg * (30 - x)

Total milk produced every day: 1 kg * x + 2 kg * (30 - x)

To simplify the expression, we can distribute the 1 and 2 coefficients to the terms inside the parentheses:

Total milk produced every day: x kg + 2 *(30 - x)
Total milk produced every day: x kg + 2 * 30 - 2 * x
Total milk produced every day: x kg + 60 - 2x

To find the final expression for the total milk Mary collects daily, we can bring the x terms together:

Total milk produced every day: x kg + 60 - 2x
Total milk produced every day: (1 kg + 60 - 2x)

But since Mary starts with 30 sheep, x equals 15. So we can simply substitute x = 15 into our expression to find the total milk Mary collects daily:

Total milk produced every day: (1 kg + 60 - 2*15)
Total milk produced every day: (1 kg + 60 - 30)
Total milk produced every day: 21 kg

{The final answer is: 21 kg}</s>","Half of the sheep is 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15.

                 [/INST] Let's go through the problem step by step:
1. Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls for breakfast. A dozen is equal to 12. {12 rolls in total}
2. She gave one roll to each of her 6 children. That's 6 rolls given to the children. {6 rolls remains}
3. Mrs. Sherman broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces. She broke a total of 6 rolls. So, she made 6 x 8 = 48 pieces of rolls. {48 pieces formed from the remaining rolls}
4. She fed some of these pieces to the chickens. The problem doesn't state how many chickens there are, but since she fed the pieces to the chickens and not to the children, we can assume the rolls given to the chickens are separate from the rolls given to the children.
5. To find the number of pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we can subtract the number of rolls given to the children from the total number of pieces formed.

Step 2: Half of the class likes blue, so there are 40 * 0.5 = <<40*0.5=20>>20 pupils who like blue.

Step 3: Subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils to find the number of pupils who like green or yellow. 40 - 20 = <<40-20=20>>20 pupils remaining.

Step 4: One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. So there are 20 * 0.25 = <<20*0.25=5>>5 pupils who like green.

Step 5: Since the rest of the pupils like yellow, the number of pupils who like yellow is the total number of pupils remaining after subtracting the number of pupils who like blue and green.

                 [/INST] To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked. We know she got $56 from selling these apples.
2. The price of each apple is $4. To find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday, we divide the total amount of money she got by the price of one apple.
   Apples picked on Monday = Total money / Price per apple
   = $56 / $4 per apple
   = 14 apples

3. On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.
4. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   Apples picked on Wednesday = Apples picked on Tuesday * 2
   = 12 apples * 2
   = 24 apples

5. To find out how many apples Lucy picked in total over the three days, we add the number of apples she picked on each day.
   Total apples picked = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday
   = 14 apples + 12 apples + 24 apples
   = 49 apples

{The final answer is: Lucy picked 49 apples over the three days.}</s>","Since each apple costs $4, it means that on Monday, Lucy picked 56/4 = <<56/4=14>>14 apples
Combining Monday and Tuesday, Lucy picked 14 + 12 = <<14+12=26>>26 apples
On Wednesday, she picked 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 apples

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Lindsay has 50 pairs of socks that need washing. Each pair of socks contains 2 socks.
2. Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks, which is equal to 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 socks.
3. Lindsay also washes 15 loose socks, which is 15 socks.
4. In total, Lindsay has washed 20 socks from pairs and 15 loose socks, which is a total of 20 + 15 = <<20+15=35>>35 socks.
5. We know that Lindsay thought she had missed some socks and that there are 50 pairs of socks that need washing. So, to find out how many socks Lindsay missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing.
6. Therefore, the difference between the number of socks that need washing and the number of socks Lindsay has washed is equals to 50 x 2 - 35 = <<50*2-35=30>>30 socks.

{The final answer is: Lindsay has missed 30 socks}.</s>","Splitting the pairs shows there were 10 pairs of socks * 2 socks/pair = <<10*2=20>>20 socks paired together.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Rachel bought 0.23 × 100 = 23 cookies.
Step 2: Janet gave Rachel an additional 42 cookies. So, Rachel now has 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.
Step 3: Rachel's brother ate 44 % or 44/100 × 65 = 28 × 65 = 1820/100 × 65 = 1176 cookies. (Note: We had to convert the percentage to a decimal form first, 0.44 = 0.44 × 100 = 44%)
Step 4: Subtract the number of cookies Rachel's brother ate from the number of cookies Rachel had: 65 - 1176 = -1111. However, since Rachel can't have a negative number of cookies, we need to find out how many cookies were actually taken away - This is not a reasonable situation as the given number of cookies Rachel had after Janet's gift was much higher than the number of cookies her brother could have eaten.

As we noticed in step 4, the situation presented in the question doesn't make sense. We cannot figure out how many cookies are left for Rachel, as the number of cookies her brother could have eaten is not reasonable given the number of cookies Rachel had after Janet's gift. {The final answer is: The question is not logically sound and doesn't provide enough information to determine how many cookies are left for Rachel}.</s>","The number of Rachel's cookies is 23 + 42 = <<23+42=65>>65 cookies.

                 [/INST] To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the monthly interest rate and the amount of interest paid each month.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly interest rate:
The annual interest rate is 10%, so the monthly interest rate is given by:

Monthly interest rate = Annual interest rate / 12 months
Monthly interest rate = 10% / 12
Monthly interest rate = 0.083333%

Step 2: Calculate the amount of interest paid each month:
The principal amount borrowed is $3,650. To find the amount of interest paid each month, we can use the formula:

Interest = Principal amount * Monthly interest rate
Interest = $3,650 * 0.00083333
Interest ≈ $30.15

Step 3: Calculate the monthly payment amount:
The monthly payment amount includes both the principal amount and the interest paid each month. Since the payment amount is equal each month, we can use the formula for the monthly payment amount of an annuity (a series of equal payments):

Monthly payment amount = Principal amount * (1 + Monthly interest rate)^5 / (1 + Monthly interest rate)^5 - 1

Monthly payment amount ≈ $729.89

{The final answer is $729.89}</s>","Karan's interest is $3,650 × 0.1 = $<<3650*0.1=365>>365.
In total Karan has to pay $3650 + $365 = $<<3650+365=4015>>4015.
Every month she has to pay $4015 / 5 = $<<4015/5=803>>803.

Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for a duration of 5 hours.
Total distance for Chloe = Speed * Time
Total distance for Chloe = 9 kilometers/hour * 5 hours
Total distance for Chloe = 45 kilometers

Step 2: Calculate the total distance Cho hiked.
Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for a duration of 8 hours.
Total distance for Cho = Speed * Time
Total distance for Cho = 14 kilometers/hour * 8 hours
Total distance for Cho = 112 kilometers

Step 3: Find the difference in distance between Cho and Chloe.
Distance difference = Distance\_Cho - Distance\_Chloe
Distance difference = 112 kilometers - 45 kilometers
Distance difference = 67 kilometers

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's find out how many silver pesos Anna has. We know that Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel. So,

Silver pesos with Anna = 2 * Silver pesos with Axel

Step 2: Axel has 50 silver pesos. Therefore, Anna has,

Anna's Silver pesos = 2 * Axel's Silver pesos = 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos

Step 3: We are also given that Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel. So,

Gold pesos with Anna = Axel's Gold pesos + 40

Step 4: Thus, the total number of pesos they have is the sum of their silver pesos and their gold pesos. So,

Total pesos = Silver pesos with Axel + Silver pesos with Anna + Gold pesos with Axel + Gold pesos with Anna

Step 5: From the problem, we know that Axel has 50 silver pesos and an unspecified number of gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel and 40 more gold pesos. So, the total number of pesos they have is,

Total pesos = 50 (Axel's Silver pesos) + 100 (Anna's Silver pesos) + Axel's Gold pesos + (Axel's Gold pesos + 40)

Step 6: However, the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact number of gold pesos Axel has. So, we cannot find the exact total number of pesos they have based on the given information.

Therefore, the final answer is that we cannot determine the total number of pesos they have with the given information.</s>","Axel has 50 + 80 = <<50+80=130>>130 pesos.

Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so 3 pitchers hold 3 × 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 cups in total.

Step 2: Calculate the revenue Millie can make by selling all the lemonade.
Millie sells each cup for $1, so the revenue from selling all 36 cups is 36 × $1 = $36.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the supplies Millie spent.
Millie spent $18 on supplies to make 36 cups of lemonade. To find the cost per cup, we divide the total cost by the number of cups: $18 ÷ 36 = $0.5. Millie sells each cup for $1, so her profit per cup is $1 - $0.5 = $0.5.

Step 4: Calculate the profit Millie makes per hour.
Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, so her revenue per hour is 4 × $1 = $4. Her profit per hour is the difference between her revenue and the cost of supplies per hour: $4 - $0.5 = $3.5.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Mr. Rutherford sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. Let's represent the initial amount of land as X.

Step 2: We know that 3/5 of the land was sold, so the amount of land left is 1/5 of the initial land. Thus, 12.8 hectares = 1/5 * X

Step 3: To solve for X, we need to isolate it in the given equation:
1/5 * X = 12.8

Step 4: We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5:
X = 12.8 * 5

Step 5: Simplifying this expression, we get:
X = 64

{The final answer is that Mr. Rutherford had 64 hectares of land at first.}</s>","Mr. Ruther is left with 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.

1. James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.
2. He delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

To find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu, we need to calculate 1/3 of the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson:

1/3 * 66

Calculate the result:

1/3 * 66 = 22

So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

To find the total number of messages James delivers, add the number of messages he delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22

Calculate the result:

Total messages = 88

Cost of 1 ticket = $2
Number of tickets needed for all 9 rides = 9
So, the cost of tickets for one person = $2 * 9 = $18

Step 2: Find the cost of buying ride bracelets for both David and Dasha.
Cost of a ride bracelet for one person = $30
Number of bracelets needed = 2 (one for each)
So, the total cost of ride bracelets = $30 * 2 = $60

Step 3: Find the savings David gets by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets for himself.
Cost of tickets for David = $18 * 1 (since Dasha buys individual tickets) = $18
Savings = Cost of a ride bracelet for David - Cost of tickets for David = $30 (bracelet) - $18 (tickets) = $12

                 [/INST] To find the number of popsicles each person has, we first need to determine how many popsicles represent the 5-part and the 6-part of the ratio.

Let's find out the number of popsicles for each part in the ratio:
1. Part of the ratio representing Betty is 5, which we will denote as x.

2. Part of the ratio representing Sam is 6, which we will denote as y.

We know that the sum of the number of popsicles for both Betty and Sam equals 165. So,

x (Betty's popsicles) + y (Sam's popsicles) = 165

Since the ratio of popsicles between Betty and Sam is 5:6, we can also express the relationship between x and y in terms of their quotient and divisor:

x / y = 5 / 6

We can cross-multiply to find the equation relating x and y:

x = (5/6) * y

Let's find the value of y (the number of popsicles that Sam has) based on the given information:

y = 6 * x

Now we can calculate the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have:

x = (5/6) * 165
x = 116.25

Since we cannot have a fraction of a popsicle, we'll round down and consider x = 116 popsicles for Betty. We can now calculate the number of popsicles Sam has:

y = 6 * 116
y = 697.2

Again, since we cannot have a fraction of a popsicle, we'll round up and consider y = 700 popsicles for Sam.

To find the difference between the number of popsicles that Sam and Betty have, we calculate:

Sam's popsicles (y) - Betty's popsicles (x) = 700 - 116
Sam's popsicles (y) - Betty's popsicles (x) = 584

So, {The final answer is Sam has 584 more popsicles than Betty}.</s>","The total ratio representing the number of popsicles that Betty and sam have is 5+6 = <<5+6=11>>11.
Since Betty has 5/11 of the total number of popsicles they have together, she has 5/11*165 = <<5/11*165=75>>75 popsicles.
Sam has 165-75 = <<165-75=90>>90 popsicles.

1. The cost of Netflix is $10 per month.
2. The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each.
3. Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling, so his total cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is:

   $10 (Hulu) + $10 (Disney Plus) + 20% discount on the sum:

   $10 + $10 + 0.2 * ($10 + $10) = $17.60 (total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus without the discount)
   $17.60 * 0.8 (discounted cost after 20% discount) = $14.08 (total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the discount)

4. The total cost of all three services (Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus) is:

   $10 (Netflix) + $14.08 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $24.08

                 [/INST] Let's first find the total amount of time Carol spent on writing, recording, and editing the song.

1. Carol spent 4 hours writing the song.
2. She spent half that time recording it, so she spent 4 hours * 0.5 = 2 hours recording.
3. Carol spent 90 minutes editing the song, which is equal to 90 minutes * 60 minutes/hour = 540 minutes.

So, the total amount of time Carol spent on writing, recording, and editing the song is 4 hours + 2 hours + 540 minutes = 4 hours + 2 hours + 900 minutes.

Now let's convert all hours into minutes for easier comparison: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes. So, the total time in minutes is 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 900 minutes = 1260 minutes.

Therefore, the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing is 90 minutes / 1260 minutes * 100% = 7.14%. (Since percentages are rounded to two decimal places, this would be rounded to 7.14%.)

4. Let's assume that the current number of books is x. Then,wendy wants 2x books.
5. Number of books in one cell with current number of books is x.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find out how many days the builder works in a week. We know that he works for 6 days every week.

Step 2: Next, let's find out how many weeks the builder works in a year. We know that he works for 4 weeks every month and there are 12 months in a year. So, the total number of weeks he works in a year is:

Weeks in a year = Weeks per month * Months per year
= 4 weeks * 12 months
= 48 weeks

Step 3: Now, let's find out how many days the builder works in a year. Since he works for 6 days every week, the total number of days he works in a year is:

Days in a year = Days per week * Weeks per year
= 6 days * 48 weeks
= 288 days

Step 4: Finally, to find out how much money the builder earns in a year, we multiply the number of days he works in a year by the amount he gets paid per day.

Earnings in a year = Days in a year * Pay per day

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies.

A normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour, and since 1 cup is equal to 16 ounces, and each bag contains 2 cups (or 16 ounces * 2 = 32 ounces), Mark needs:

Flour = 3 cups * (16 ounces / cup) * (2 bags / 32 ounces) = 1 bag

The normal recipe also calls for 1 cup of milk, so Mark needs:

Milk = 1 cup * (2 bottles / 1 cup) = 2 bottles

Step 2: Determine how many extra bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark has to buy for a quadruple batch

Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 times the amount of flour and milk in the normal recipe. Therefore:

Flour for quadruple batch = 1 bag * 4 = 4 bags

Milk for quadruple batch = 2 bottles * 4 = 8 bottles

Mark already has 1 bag of flour, so he needs to buy:

Extra flour = 4 bags - 1 bag = 3 bags

The question asks for the difference in number of bags between flour and milk. Since Mark already has 1 bag of flour, we subtract the number of bottles of milk he needs from the number of extra bags of flour he needs:

Extra milk in bottles = 8 bottles - 2 bottles = 6 bottles

Step 3: Determine how many more bags of flour Mark has to buy based on the given information

The question states that 2 cups of flour come in one 2-cup bag and 2 cups of milk come in one 2-cup bottle. To find out the difference in the number of bags and bottles Mark needs to buy, we use the conversion factor provided in the question:

1 bag of flour = 2 cups and 1 bag = 32 ounces

1 bottle of milk = 2 cups and 1 bottle = 32 ounces

Let x be the number of additional bags of flour Mark needs and y be the number of additional bottles of milk Mark needs.

We know that 3 bags = 48 ounces (12 ounces per bag * 3 bags) and 6 bottles = 48 ounces (2 ounces per bottle * 6 bottles).

Now we can set up an equation to find the difference between x and y:

32 ounces * x = 48 ounces
x = 48 ounces / 32 ounces = 1.5
x = 3 bags * 1.5 = 4.5 bags
Since Mark can only buy whole bags, he must buy 5 bags to have an extra amount of flour equal to 4.5 bags.

The final answer is: Mark has to buy 5 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.</s>","To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 3 cups * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cups of flour.
To get 12 cups of flour, Mark needs to buy: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = <<12/2=6>>6 bags
To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 1 cup * 4 = <<1*4=4>>4 cups of milk
To get 4 cups of milk, Mark needs to buy: 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = <<4/2=2>>2 bottles of milk
Finally, subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour to find the difference: 6 - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4

Since Mel uses 900 watts each hour, we don't need to calculate this.

Step 2: Find out how many watts Mel uses in a day.
Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, so he uses 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watts or 7.2 kW (kilowatts) of electric energy per day.

Step 3: Find out how many watts Mel uses in 30 days.
Mel uses 7.2 kW of electric energy per day, so he uses 7.2 kW * 30 days = 216 kW of electric energy in 30 days.

Step 4: Find out how many watts Mel saves in one day by using the air conditioner for only 3 hours less.
Mel saves 900 watts * 5 hours = 4500 watts or 4.5 kW of electric energy per day.

Step 5: Find out how many watts Mel saves in 30 days by using the air conditioner for only 3 hours less each day.
Mel saves 4.5 kW * 30 days = 135 kW of electric energy in 30 days.

The final answer is {Mel saves 135 kW of electric energy in 30 days}.</s>","An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.

So, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.
That is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.

                 [/INST] Let's find out the number of stripes on each zebra and then calculate the average number of stripes for all zebras.

1. Jane counts 2 zebras, each with 17 stripes. So, the first 2 zebras have 17 * 2 = 34 stripes in total.
2. Another zebra has 36 stripes.
3. The last zebra has half the number of stripes as the second zebra, so it has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.
4. In total, there are 3 zebras with 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.
5. To find the average number of stripes for all zebras, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras. So, the average number of stripes for all zebras is 88 / 3 = {29.333333}.

However, since a zebra cannot have an average number of stripes but rather a certain number, we made a mistake in our assumption about the third zebra having ""half that many stripes"" as the second zebra.

                 [/INST] Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that at Allan's house, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Let x be the number of cannolis, so the number of corns is 2x.
2. The initial total number of cannolis in Allan's house is given as 40, so x = 40.
3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the new number of cannolis is x + 60.
4. Allan also had 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the new number of corns is 2x - 40.
5. Now, we want to find the combined total of corns and cannolis, which is 2x (corns) and x + 60 (cannolis).

Combined total = 2x + (x + 60)

6. To simplify, we can combine like terms:

Combined total = 2x + x + 60
Combined total = 3x + 60

{The final answer is 3x + 60.}

However, since we know that x = 40 (the initial number of cannolis), we can substitute it back into the equation to find the exact combined total:

Combined total = 3 * 40 + 60
Combined total = 120 + 60
Combined total = 180

So, the final combined total of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house is 180.</s>","Before buying any corn and cannoli, Allan had twice as much corn as cannoli, which is 40 cannoli * 2 corn/cannoli = <<40*2=80>>80 corns
The total number of corns and cannolis that Allan had before is 80 corn + 40 corn = <<80+40=120>>120 corn
When he bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, he bought 60 corn - 40 corn = <<60-40=20>>20 corns
In total, he bought 20 corns + 60 cannolis = <<20+60=80>>80 items
After the purchases, Allan has 120 items + 80 items = <<120+80=200>>200 total corns and cannolis combined.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps per day.
2. He walked half of his steps to and from school, so he walked 10,000 * 0.5 = 5,000 steps.
3. He did an additional 1,000 steps with his friend, so in total he had walked 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.
4. He also went for a short jog, and after the jog he had 2,000 steps left.
5. To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we need to subtract the number of steps he took before the jog from the total number of steps he wanted to take in a day. So, 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps.

However, there's a mistake in the problem statement. The number of steps Elliott had left after the jog should be 8,000, not 2,000. With this correction, we can calculate the number of steps he took during the jog by subtracting the number of steps he took before the jog from the total number of steps he wanted to take in a day.

Therefore, the correct answer is: Elliott took 4,000 steps during his jog.

{The final answer is: Elliott took 4,000 steps during his jog.}</s>","Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

Total number of words = Number of pages * Words per page
Total number of words = 45 pages * 200 words/page
Total number of words = 9000 words

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes Toby to finish the book.
Time to read one word = 1 minute / Reading rate
Time to read one word = 1 minute / 300 words/minute
Time to read one word = 1/300 minutes/word

Time to read entire book = Total number of words * Time to read one word
Time to read entire book = 9000 words * (1/300) minutes/word
Time to read entire book = 30 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes Toby to get to the airport after finishing the book.
Travel time to airport = 10 minutes

- In June, the company paid 30 employees.

Total payroll in May = Weekly pay per employee * Number of employees
Total payroll in May = $600 * 40
Total payroll in May = $24,000

Total payroll in June = Weekly pay per employee * Number of employees
Total payroll in June = $600 * 30
Total payroll in June = $18,000

Step 4: Calculate the total payroll for the two months.
Total payroll in two months = Total payroll in May + Total payroll in June
Total payroll in two months = $24,000 + $18,000
Total payroll in two months = $42,000

{The final answer is: The company paid a total of $42,000 to the employees in May and June.}</s>","When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000

2 pounds * $3/pound = $6

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mixed bag of seashells.
$1.50

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the four magnets.

Step 4: Add up all the costs to find out how much Sally spent in total.
$6 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $8.50

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of the first two packages of fireworks.
Each package costs $400. So the cost of the first package is $400.
The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

Step 2: Calculate the discount on the two packages.
There is a 20% discount on the packages. So the discount on each package is $400 (for the first package) or $800 (for the second package) * 0.2 = $800 * 0.2 = $800 * 0.02 = $160.

Step 3: Subtract the discount from the cost of the packages to find the cost after the discount.
The cost of the first package after the discount is $400 - $160 = $240.
The cost of the second package after the discount is $800 - $160 = $640.

Step 4: Add the cost of the two packages after the discount and the cost of the finale firework to find the total cost.
The total cost is $240 + $640 + $150 = $1030.

2. So, she consumes 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 cookies a week.
3. Therefore, to have enough cookies for 30 days, she needs 14 * 4 = <<14*4=56>>56 cookies.
4. Her recipe makes 12 madeleine cookies, so she needs to make 56 / 12 = <<56/12=4.67>>4.67 dozens of cookies.

1. We know that 5% of Marcy's candles are more dangerous and have the defect of smelling like wet dog. So, the number of such candles is:
   {5% of 50000 = 0.05 * 50000 = 2500}
2. However, the question states that only a subset of these candles also explode. The problem does not provide enough information to determine what percentage of these candles explode, so we cannot find an exact number for this solution.

Step 4: The blouses are on the 30% off rack, so we need to find the discounted price for each blouse. A 30% discount on a $20 blouse would be $20 * 0.3 = $<<20*0.3=6>>6.

Step 5: Subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price for one blouse: $20 - $6 = $<<20-6=14>>14

                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many apples Joanne gathered from each type of tree:

1. From tallest trees: Joanne gathered 30 apples.
2. From shortest trees: Joanne gathered half of what she gathered from the tallest trees, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 apples.

Let's find how many apples Joanne's sister gathered from each type of tree:

1. From tallest trees: Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples as Joanne, so that's 30 * 2 = 60 apples.
2. From shortest trees: Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples as Joanne, so that's 15 * 3 = 45 apples.

Now, let's find the total number of apples the sisters gathered and the number of apples Joanne gathered from average trees:

First, let's find the total number of apples Joanne gathered:

Total apples gathered by Joanne = Apples from tallest trees + Apples from shortest trees + Apples from average trees

But we don't know how many apples Joanne gathered from average trees, and we're trying to find that, so let's look at the total apples gathered by both sisters:

Total apples gathered by the sisters = Apples gathered by Joanne + Apples gathered by Joanne's sister

We know that they gathered a combined total of 500 apples. We can find the total apples Joanne gathered and the total apples her sister gathered, then deduct the sister's apples from the total:

Total apples gathered by Joanne = Total apples gathered by the sisters - Apples gathered by Joanne's sister

Total apples gathered by Joanne = 500 - (Apples from tallest trees + Apples from shortest trees)

We know that Joanne gathered 30 apples from tallest trees and 15 apples from shortest trees, so:

Total apples gathered by Joanne = 500 - (30 + 15 + Apples from average trees)

Simplifying this:

Apples from average trees = 500 - (30 + 15 + 30) = 500 - 75 = 425

However, Joanne's sister gathered 60 apples from tallest trees and 45 apples from shortest trees, and we know that the sisters gathered a total of 500 apples. So, we have a discrepancy:

500 ≤ 30 (Joanne's apples from tallest trees) + 15 (Joanne's apples from shortest trees) + 425 (Joanne's apples from average trees) + 60 (Joanne's sister's apples from tallest trees) + 45 (Joanne's sister's apples from shortest trees)

It's impossible for the sisters to have gathered 500 apples with the given information. Therefore, there is no valid solution to find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees based on the given problem information.

The final answer is: There is no valid solution to determine how many apples Joanne gathered from average trees based on the given information.</s>","Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write the equation: C + D = 180.

Step 2: We also know that the total number of humps is 304. Since camels have two humps each and there are C camels, we have the equation: 2C + D = 304.

Step 3: To solve this system of equations, we can isolate one variable. We'll isolate C in the first equation: C = 180 - D.

Step 4: Now, substitute C = 180 - D in the second equation: 2(180 - D) + D = 304.

Step 5: Expand and simplify the equation: 360 - 2D + D = 304.

Step 6: Solve for D: 2D = 56.

Step 7: Divide both sides by 2 to find the value of D: D = 28.

Step 8: Check if this value of D satisfies the first equation: 180 - D = 152 (180 - 28 = 152), which is not the case.

Step 9: There is an error in the problem statement, as the given number of heads (180) cannot lead to the given number of humps (304).

The final answer is: There is no valid solution to this problem according to the given information.</s>","Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.

2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Let's find the volume of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 the volume of Zack's locker (x):
   Peter's locker volume = 1/4 * Zack's locker volume
   Peter's locker volume = x/4

3. We know that Peter's locker volume is 5 cubic inches. Substitute x/4 for Peter's locker volume and solve for x:

Step 2: Find the elevation difference between Stanley's position and Oliver's position.

Stanley's elevation = 10,000 feet
Oliver's elevation = 3,000 feet

Elevation difference = |Stanley's elevation - Oliver's elevation|
Elevation difference = |10,000 feet - 3,000 feet|
Elevation difference = 7,000 feet

Step 3: Find the difference in elevation Oliver must climb from his current position to reach the ledge.

Elevation of the ledge = 6,000 feet
Elevation difference = 7,000 feet

Difference in elevation for Oliver to climb = Elevation difference - Elevation of the ledge
Difference in elevation for Oliver to climb = 7,000 feet - 6,000 feet
Difference in elevation for Oliver to climb = 1,000 feet

{The final answer is: Oliver must climb 1,000 feet to reach Stanley's comb.}</s>","The elevation of Stanley's comb was 10,000 - 4,000 = <<10000-4000=6000>>6,000 feet.

1. Mr. Josue received $4000 from the first bank.
2. He received twice as much as $4000 from the second bank. So, the amount from the second bank is $4000 * 2 = $8000.
3. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital.
4. Therefore, the total amount of capital he has now is the initial capital plus the amount he received from both banks.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Step 2: Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, 5 cats were taken away.

Step 3: This means that 45 cats are now left on the rock (50 - 5 = 45).

Step 4: Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. So, we need to find out how many cats ran after the mouse.

Step 5: We know that 3/5 of 45 cats ran away. To find this, we can use the following calculation: Number of cats = Initial number of cats * Percentage of cats that ran away / 100

Step 6: Plugging in the numbers from the problem, we get: Number of cats = 45 * 3/5 / 100

Step 7: This simplifies to: Number of cats = 27/10 of 45

Step 8: To find the exact number, we can multiply 27/10 and 45 and then divide by the LCM of 10: Number of cats = (27 * 45) / LCM(10, 27) = 13.2 * 45 = 588/10 = 58.8. However, since cats can't be in fractions of themselves, we can't have a fraction of a cat running after the mouse (or there's an error in the problem statement).

So, unfortunately, we cannot find the final answer with the given information as it's inconsistent (half a cat cannot exist).

Therefore, there is no final answer.</s>","When four boats carried away 5 cats each, the total number of cats that left the rock is 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cats.
The number of cats remaining on the rock became 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30.
Later 3/5 of the remaining cats left the rock and ran after a mouse, a total of 3/5*30 = <<3/5*30=18>>18 cats.
The number of cats that remained on the rock is 30-18 = <<30-18=12>>12 cats

- Cole bought new jeans for a dance contest.
- Cole wanted to buy jeans at a store.
- Cole couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans.
- Cole bought both types of jeans since they were on sale.
- The tattered jeans cost $28.
- The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
- Cole saved a total of $6 from the sales.

Step 2: Determine the difference in cost between the two types of jeans.
- Let x be the original cost of the tattered jeans.
- The jogger jeans cost x - $6.

Step 3: Solve for x using the given information that Cole saved $6 from the total sales, and 1/3 of that came from the sale of the jogger jeans.
- Let y be the amount Cole saved from the sale of the jogger jeans.
- 1/3 y = $2 (since 1/3 of $6 is $2)
- y = $6
- Cole saved the whole $6 from the sale of the tattered jeans.
- So, x - ($6 for jogger jeans) + x = $28 (total cost of both jeans)
- 2x - $6 = $28
- 2x = $34
- x = $17

Step 4: Find the difference in cost between tattered and jogger jeans.
- The difference in cost is x - (x - $6) = $6

{The final answer is $6.} This means that jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than tattered jeans.</s>","Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.

2. Four buses were rented, each with a capacity of 60 employees.
3. Additionally, six minibusses were rented, each with a capacity of 30 employees.
4. And ten minivans were rented, each with a capacity of 15 employees.
5. To find the total capacity of the buses, we can add the capacity of the buses, minibusses, and minivans:
   Total capacity = (4 * 60) + (6 * 30) + (10 * 15)
6. Performing the multiplication first and then the addition:
   Total capacity = (4 * 60) + (6 * 30) + (10 * 15)
   Total capacity = 240 + 180 + 150

Original price of soup = $25 / 1.25
Original price of soup = $20

Step 2: Find the price of the cake. The cake costs only half the price of the bagel. So, the price of the cake is:
Price of cake = 0.5 * $4
Price of cake = $2

Step 3: Find the total cost of the meal. The cost of the soup, bagel, and cake are $20, $4, and $2, respectively. So, the total cost is:

                 [/INST] To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of cards Kenny has as C.

1. First, we know that Kenny sells 2/3 of his cards for $1.5 each. Thus, the total amount of money he gets from selling his cards is: 1.5 * (2/3) * C.

2. We also know that after spending $50 on cards and the amusement park tickets, Kenny has $50 left for spending. So, his total spending on cards and the park is: $100 + $50 = $150.

3. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 1.5 * (2/3) * C + $50 = $150.

4. Solving for C requires isolating C on one side of the equation. By following some simple algebraic steps, we can rearrange the equation as: C = (3/2 * $150) / ($1.5).

5. To find the exact number of cards, we can calculate the value: C = (3/2 * $150) / ($1.5) = 150 * (3/2)/(1.5) = 150 * (1.8666...) ≈ 279.99

6. Since the number of cards must be a whole number, we know that Kenny's initial collection of cards must be slightly more than 280.

{The final answer is approximately 281 cards.}</s>","He made $150 selling the cards because 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of hotdogs prepared for one guest to have two hotdogs.
Each guest required two hotdogs. So, the number of hotdogs prepared for one guest is 2 hotdogs.

Step 2: Calculate the number of hotdogs prepared for all the guests.
The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs each. So, the number of guests was 36 and half of them required 2 hotdogs each, so the caterer prepared hotdogs for 36 * 0.5 = <<36*0.5=""18.0"">>18 guests. So, the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = <<18*2=""36"">>36 hotdogs.

Step 3: Determine the number of hotdogs consumed by all the guests.
All the guests (36) consumed one hotdog each, so they consumed 36 hotdogs. Since there were also 18 hotdogs for the second serving, a total of 36 + 18 = <<36+18=""54"">>54 hotdogs were consumed.

Step 4: Calculate the number of hotdogs consumed by the guests who wanted a second serving.
40 guests showed up instead of 36 and everyone had a second hotdog. So, an additional 14 guests had a second serving, consuming 14 more hotdogs.

Step 5: Find out the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog.
Since 54 hotdogs were consumed in total and an extra 14 hotdogs were served beyond the number originally prepared, there were 54 - 14 = <<54-14=""40"">>40 guests who were able to have both of their hotdogs. Since 40 guests showed up, this means that the remaining 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.</s>","The food caterer prepared an additional 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 hot dogs.
Altogether, he prepared 36 + 18 = <<36+18=54>>54 hotdogs.

                    , Charlotte . went , into the kitchen . supply store , knowing she wanted a ; set of . pot and pans for $120.00, a set , of mixing . bowls for $20.00 and 5 separate utensils : at $5.00 ! each.  At check out, ; the clerk told her everything was 20% off.  How : much : was her ! order?
                 [/INST] Let's calculate Charlotte's total order cost step by step:

1. Charlotte purchased a set of pots and pans for $120.00.
2. She bought a set of mixing bowls for $20.00.
3. She also bought 5 utensils, with each utensil costing $5.00. So the total cost of utensils is $5.00 x 5 = $25.00.

Now let's find the total cost of Charlotte's order before the discount:
Total_before_discount = $120.00 (pots and pans) + $20.00 (mixing bowls) + $25.00 (utensils) = $165.00

Next, let's apply the 20% discount:
Discounted_amount = 0.2 (20%) x $165.00 = $33.00
Then, we'll subtract the discounted amount from the original cost to find the final amount Charlotte paid:
Total_after_discount = $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

{The final answer is $132.00}</s>","She wants 5 utensils at $5.00 each so they cost 5*5 = $<<5*5=25.00>>25.00
The utensils are $25, the pots and pans are $120 and the mixing bowls are $20 for a total of 25+120+20 = $<<25+120+20=165>>165
Everything is 20% off, and her total is $165 so 165*.20= $<<165*.20=33.00>>33.00
The total was $165 and she gets a $33.00 discount so 165-33 = $<<165-33=132.00>>132.00 is her total price

                 [/INST] To find out how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball, we need to find the total cost of these items and then subtract the amount of money she already has.

The cost of the skipping rope is $6.
The cost of the board game is $11.
The cost of the playground ball is $2.

First, let's find the total cost of these items:

Total cost = Cost of skipping rope + Cost of board game + Cost of playground ball
Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2
Total cost = $19

Dora currently has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother. Together, this is:

Money Dora has = $2 (allowance) + $16 (gift)
Money Dora has = $18

To find out how much more money Dora needs, subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items she wants to buy:

Money Dora needs = Total cost - Money Dora has
Money Dora needs = $19 - $18
Money Dora needs = $1

{The final answer is: Dora needs an additional $1 to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.}</s>","The total cost of the skipping rope, the game, and the ball is $6 + $11 + $2 = $<<6+11+2=19>>19.
The total amount of money from the allowance and her mother is $2 + $16 = $<<2+16=18>>18.
Dora needs $19 − $18 = $1.

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons with his sword.
2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 75 dragons (0.75 * 100 = 75).
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 150 dragons (1 * 75 = 150).
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file. We're given the number of dragons slain by the other princes, so let's find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slay:

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many gallons are in each container if 15 gallons are equally divided among 5 containers.

 contained = Total gallons / Number of containers
 containers = 15 gallons / 5
 containers ≈ 3 gallons

 Step 2: Now that we know each container holds approximately 3 gallons, we can find out how many gallons Josey needs for her lawnmower which is 1/4 of a container.

 needed_gallons = 1/4 * containers
 needed_gallons = 1/4 * 3 gallons
 needed_gallons = 0.75 gallons

 Step 3: Finally, we need to convert the gallons to pints since the question asks for the answer in pints. We know 1 gallon is equal to 128 pints.

 needed_pints = needed_gallons * Pints per gallon
 needed_pints = 0.75 gallons * 128 pints/gallon
 needed_pints = 96 pints

1. Find out how many bags of chips George bought with $5.
2. Determine the cost of each bag of chips.
3. Find out how many candy bars George could buy with the remaining 1% of his money.
4. Determine the cost of one candy bar.
5. Find the number of candy bars that George bought.

Let's calculate:

1. George spent $5 on chips. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, so the number of bags he bought is: $5 / $0.4 = 12.5 ≈ 13 bags.
2. One bag of chips costs 40 cents, so:

3. George had 1% of his $5 remaining. So, he had: $5 * 0.01 = $0.05 or 5 cents remaining.
4. One candy bar costs $0.75, so:

5. To find the number of candy bars that George bought, divide his $5 spending on chips by the cost of one chip and then subtract the number of candy bars he bought: 
$5 / $0.4 = 12.5 ≈ 13 bags
$5 spending on chips = $5 * 13 = $6.93 (rounding up from $6.90)
$6.93 spent on chips and candy bars = $6.93 - $4.56 (for 13 bags of chips) = $2.37
$2.37 spent on candy bars / $0.75 per candy bar = ≈ 3.15 ≈ 3 candy bars

Thus, George bought 3 bags of chips and 3 candy bars.

1. The total weight of the cake is 20 ounces.
2. The cake is cut into 8 equal pieces.

3. To find the weight of each piece, we can divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces:
   Weight of one piece = Total weight / Number of pieces
   = 20 ounces / 8
   = 2.5 ounces

4. So, each piece weighs 2.5 ounces, and since there are two people having a piece, the weight of the pieces they consumed is:
   Total weight of consumed pieces = Weight of one piece × Number of pieces for each person
   = 2.5 ounces/piece × 2 persons
   = 5 ounces

5. Now, to find the weight of the remaining cake, we can subtract the weight of the pieces that were consumed from the total weight of the cake:
   Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Weight of consumed pieces
   = 20 ounces - 5 ounces

Given information:
- Sitti bought 34 oranges
- Juris bought 22 oranges

Total number of oranges = Oranges bought by Sitti + Oranges bought by Juris
Total number of oranges = 34 + 22
Total number of oranges = 56

Now, we need to find out how many oranges each person will get when distributed equally among 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends):

Oranges per person = Total number of oranges / Number of people
Oranges per person = 56 / 8
Oranges per person = 7 with a remainder of 0 (according to the Euclidean division algorithm).

Since there is no remainder, everyone will receive exactly the same number of oranges.

{The final answer is: Each person will receive 7 oranges.}</s>","There are a total of 34 + 22 = <<34+22=56>>56 oranges.

Onions: 12 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the cost of onions at $2.00 per pound.
Cost of onions = 12 pounds * $2.00/pound
Cost of onions = $24.00

Step 3: Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving for onions is the cost of onions divided by the number of servings.
Cost per serving for onions = $24.00 / 6
Cost per serving for onions ≈ $4.00

Step 4: Determine the amount of beef stock for 2 boxes.
Beef stock: 2 boxes

Step 5: Calculate the cost of beef stock at $2.00 per box.
Cost of beef stock = 2 boxes * $2.00/box
Cost of beef stock = $4.00

Step 6: Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving for beef stock is the cost of beef stock divided by the number of servings (assuming equal amounts of soup per serving for onions and beef stock). We don't have a specific amount of beef stock in the recipe, so let's assume equal amounts for analysis.
Assuming equal amounts:
Cost per serving for beef stock = $4.00 / 6
Cost per serving for beef stock ≈ $0.67

Step 7: Now, let's calculate the total cost per serving.
Total cost per serving = Cost per serving for onions + Cost per serving for beef stock
Total cost per serving ≈ $4.00 + $0.67
Total cost per serving ≈ $4.67

{The final answer is approximately $4.67 for the cost per serving.}</s>","His recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions but he wants to double that amount so he needs 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 pounds of onions

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the driving time for Bernadette from her apartment to the theater.
Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, we can calculate the driving time for Bernadette as follows:
Driving time for Bernadette = 4 minutes (Wayne's driving time) * 4 (four times longer) = 16 minutes

Step 2: Determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to subtract her driving time from the time Wayne will arrive at the theater. Since Wayne arrives 5 minutes before the premiere and Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes earlier than Wayne, we have:
Time Bernadette should arrive = Wayne's arrival time - 5 minutes
Wayne's arrival time = Time of the premiere - 5 minutes

First, we need to find the time of the premiere:
Given that Wayne arrives 5 minutes before the premiere, we have:
Wayne's arrival time = Time of the premiere - 5 minutes

Now we can set up the equation:
Time Bernadette should arrive = (Time of the premiere - 5 minutes) - Driving time for Bernadette

Substitute the values we have found:
Time Bernadette should leave = (Time of the premiere - 5 minutes) - 16 minutes

Since we don't have the specific time of the premiere in the problem statement, we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, the above equation shows that Bernadette should leave 11 minutes earlier than the premiere time to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. {The final answer is Bernadette should leave 11 minutes earlier than Wayne's arrival time (which is the premiere time).}</s>","Bernadette takes 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 minutes to get to the theater.
Her ride takes 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 minutes longer than Wayne’s to get to the theater.
Thus, she should leave 12 + 5 = <<12+5=17>>17 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater 5 minutes sooner than he does.

                 [/INST] We are given that the area of Billie's bedroom is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. We first need to convert the length from yards to feet, as the area is given in square feet and the perimeter is a measure in feet.

1. Converting yards to feet: 1 yard = 3 feet
So, the length of 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

Now we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Since only the length is given, we can assume the width to be equal to the length. In a rectangle, the length and the width have a ratio of 1:1, meaning they are both equal.

2. Calculate Perimeter: Since Length (L) = Width (W) = 9 feet
Perimeter = 2 * (L + W) = 2 * (L + L) = 2 * 2L = 2 * 2 * 9 = 36 feet

She also bought 4 packs of red beads, which is 4 * number of pieces in a pack = 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 pieces.
So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = <<60+80=140>>140 pieces of beads.

Step 2: Find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters.
{The final answer is: 140 (Margareth's beads) - 60 (Elizabeth's beads) = <<140-60=80>>80 pieces}
Therefore, Margareth has 80 more pieces of beads than Elizabeth.</s>","Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs.
So Elizabeth bought 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 pieces of beads.
Margareth bought 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 packs.
So Margareth bought 7 x 20 = <<7*20=140>>140 pieces of beads.
Therefore, Margareth bought 140 - 60 = <<140-60=80>>80 more beads than Elizabeth.

                 [/INST] To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the effect of baking on the temperature and the effect of opening the window on it.

Step 1: Calculate the temperature increase due to baking.
Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees per hour.
Temperature increase = 3 hours × 5 degrees/hour
Temperature increase = 15 degrees

Step 2: Calculate the temperature decrease due to opening the window.
The window is open for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. So, the house cools down 2 degrees for 1/2 hour (30 minutes).
Temperature decrease = 2 degrees/10 minutes × 1/2 hour
Temperature decrease = 1 degree

Step 3: Find the final temperature.
Initially, the house temperature is 40 degrees. After baking, its temperature is 15 degrees higher. Then, due to opening the window, it decreases by 1 degree.
Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase - Temperature decrease
Final temperature = 40 degrees + 15 degrees - 1 degree
{The final answer is: The final temperature of the house is 54 degrees.}</s>","First find the total temperature increase from the oven: 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees
Then add that amount to the starting temperature: 15 degrees + 40 degrees = <<15+40=55>>55 degrees
Then divide the time the window is open by 10 minutes to find how many 2-degree temperature decreases there are: 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3
Then multiply the number of decreases by the amount of each decrease: 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees
Then subtract that amount from the house's temperature after baking to find the final temperature: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = <<55-6=49>>49 degrees

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the time taken by Jon for each event.
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour + 20 minutes = 80 minutes + 120 seconds = 200 minutes = 3 hours
- Run: 50 minutes

Step 2: Find the time taken by James for the swim and bike ride.
- Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, the time taken by James for the swim is 90% of Jon's time.
- Swim time for James: 40 minutes * 90% = 36 minutes
- For the bike ride, the difference between their times is 5 minutes, so James takes 1 hour and 15 minutes (20 minutes longer than Jon).
- Bike ride time for James: 1 hour + 20 minutes = 80 minutes + 120 seconds = 200 minutes - 6 minutes = 196 minutes = 3 hours 12 minutes

Step 3: Find the time taken by James for the run since the difference in their finishing times is only 10 minutes.

The final answer is: Since the difference in their finishing times is only 10 minutes, James must have taken this difference in time for the run. Therefore, James completed the run in 50 minutes - 10 minutes = 40 minutes.</s>","Jon did the bike ride in 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes

1. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B.
2. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C.
3. Movie C is 1.25 hours long.

First, let's determine the length of Movie C in minutes. We know that:
1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 1.25 hours = 1.25 × 60 = 75 minutes

Now, Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so the length of Movie B is:
Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes = 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can calculate the length of Movie A:
Movie A = (1/4) × Movie B = (1/4) × 80 minutes ≈ 20 minutes

{The final answer is Movie A is approximately 20 minutes long.}</s>","Movie C = 1.25 hours = 75 minutes

                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 MPH.

1. We know that 1 mile = 5280 feet, and 1 hour = 3600 seconds, so 1 mile/hour = 5280/3600 = 1.472778 miles/hour.
2. To find the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes, we multiply its speed (32 miles/hour) by the number of hours in 30 minutes (0.5 hours): 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.
3. Since the horse runs 16 miles, and we know that the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, we can calculate how many bails of hay Michael needs to buy: 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails of hay.
4. To find out how much hay costs, we multiply the number of bails needed (8) by the cost per bail ($3): 8 bails * $3/bail = $24.
5. Michael has six $5 bills. To find out how much change he has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay ($24) from the total amount of money Michael had ($30, which is six $5 bills): $30 - $24 = $6.

{The final answer is: Michael has $6 in change after buying the hay.}</s>","The horse runs 16 miles because 32 x (30/60) = <<32*(30/60)=16>>16

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Rozanne used in total.
- She used 4 dozens of eggs, and there are 12 eggs in a dozen. So, she used 4 x 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in eggs cases.
- She also used 2 loose eggs, so she used 48 + 2 = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs in total.

Step 2: Determine how many eggs are needed to make one tray of eggnog.
- Each glass needs 5 eggs, and there are 5 glasses in one tray. So, one tray requires 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 eggs.

Step 3: Calculate how many trays Rozanne can make with the eggs she has.
- She has enough eggs for 50 trays (50 eggs / 25 eggs per tray), because each tray uses only 25 eggs (5 glasses x 5 eggs per glass).

{The final answer is: Rozanne can put out 50 trays of eggnog.}</s>","As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.
She therefore has a total of 48 eggs in cases + 2 loose eggs = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs.
So she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.
This means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the cost of one sneaker from the case bought by the salesman.
Cost of one sneaker = Total cost of 48 sneakers / Number of sneakers
Cost of one sneaker = $576 / 48
Cost of one sneaker = $12.21 (approximately)

Step 2: Find the number of sneakers sold at the flash sale.
Number of sneakers sold at flash sale = Number of pairs sold at flash sale * Number of sneakers per pair
Number of sneakers sold at flash sale = 17 * 2
Number of sneakers sold at flash sale = 34 (approximately)

Step 3: Calculate the revenue from the flash sale.
Revenue from flash sale = Number of sneakers sold at flash sale * Price per pair at flash sale
Revenue from flash sale = 34 * $20
Revenue from flash sale = $680

Step 4: Find the number of sneakers sold to the department store.
Total number of sneakers bought = 48 (from the question)
Number of sneakers sold at flash sale ≈ 34
So, the number of sneakers sold to the department store = Total number of sneakers bought - Number of sneakers sold at flash sale
Number of sneakers sold to the department store = 48 - 34
Number of sneakers sold to the department store = 14

Step 5: Calculate the revenue from selling sneakers to the department store.
Revenue from department store = Number of sneakers sold to the department store * Price per sneaker at the department store
Revenue from department store = 14 * $25
Revenue from department store = $350

Step 6: Find the total revenue generated by the salesman.
Total revenue = Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from department store
Total revenue = $680 + $350
Total revenue = $1,030

Step 7: Calculate the profit by subtracting the cost from the revenue.
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1,030 - ($576)
Profit = $1,030 - $576

Total cost: $15 + popcorn cost

Step 2: To find the regular price of popcorn, we need to ensure that purchasing it separately along with the movie ticket and soda costs $1 less than the cost of the super ticket.

$21 (super ticket cost) = $15 (movie ticket + soda cost) + popcorn cost

1. The cost of filling 20 helium balloons was $900 on a certain day.
2. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20.

First, let's find out how much it cost to fill one balloon before the price increase. Since the cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can find the cost of filling one balloon by dividing the total cost by the number of balloons:

Cost of filling one balloon before the increase = $900 ÷ 20 balloons = $45 per balloon

Now, let's find out how much it costs to fill one balloon after the price increase. We know that the price increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is:

Cost of filling one balloon after the increase = $45 per balloon + $20 = $65 per balloon

To find out how much it costs to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we can multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by the number of balloons:

Cost of filling 170 balloons after the increase = $65 per balloon × 170 balloons = $11,010

Therefore, the final answer is: {Bentley paid $11,010 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase}.</s>","If the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900 before the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon was $900/20=$<<900/20=45>>45

                 [/INST] To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time spent on the road.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled during each part of the trip:

1. During the first 2 hours, the car travels at 60 mph: Distance = Speed * Time => Distance = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
2. During the last hour, the car travels at 30 mph: Distance = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles

Total distance traveled = 120 miles (first part) + 30 miles (second part) = 150 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time spent on the road:

Total time = 2 hours (first part) + 1 hour (second part) = 3 hours

Now, we can find the average speed:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time => Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours

To make the answer neat and clear, we can simplify the fraction:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the volume of potting soil needed for one raised bed.
Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume of one raised bed can be calculated as: Width × Length × Height = 2 ft × 8 ft × 2 ft = 16 cubic ft

Step 2: Calculate the total volume of potting soil needed for all raised beds.
There are 10 raised beds, so the total volume of potting soil needed is: Total Volume = Number of raised beds × Volume of one raised bed = 10 × 16 cubic ft = 160 cubic ft

Step 3: Calculate the number of bags of potting soil needed.
Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. So, the number of bags needed to fill all the raised beds is: Number of Bags = Total Volume / Volume of One Bag = 160 cubic ft / 2 cubic ft/bag = 80 bags

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of potting soil.
Each bag of potting soil costs $12, so the total cost of potting soil for all the raised beds is: Total Cost = Number of Bags × Cost per Bag = 80 × $12 = $960

{The final answer is: Bob needs to buy $960 worth of potting soil to fill his vegetable garden raised beds.}</s>","Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

Step 1: We know that there are 20 red cards in the deck.

Step 2: There are 60% more green cards than red cards. So, we need to find out how many green cards there are:

Green cards = Red cards * 1.6 (since 60% is equivalent to multiplying by 1.6)
                 = 20 * 1.6
                 = 32 green cards

Step 3: Since yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards, we can calculate the number of yellow cards:

Yellow cards = Red cards + Green cards
                 = 20 + 32
                 = 52 yellow cards

Step 4: Since we know the number of cards for all three colors, we can simply add them up to find the total number of cards in the deck:

Total cards = Red cards + Green cards + Yellow cards
                 = 20 + 32 + 52
                 = 104

Step 2: After twenty minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies, which is 50/2 = 25 fairies.

Step 3: Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.

Step 4: To find out how many fairies are remaining, we need to subtract the number of fairies that have flown away from the initial number of fairies that Katelyn saw.

So,

The final answer is: 50 (initial number of fairies) - 25 (number of fairies remaining after the first friend counted) - 30 (number of fairies that flew away) = 25 - 30 = -5. However, since we can't have a negative number of fairies, this indicates an error in the problem statement.

For Jennifer's dog: 8 puppies in total, and 3 of them have spots. So, there are 3 puppies with spots.

For Brandon's dog: 12 puppies in total, and 4 of them have spots. So, there are 4 puppies with spots.

Step 2: Find the total number of puppies with spots for both dogs.

Total number of puppies with spots = Puppies with spots for Jennifer's dog + Puppies with spots for Brandon's dog

- 2 boxes of sugar cubes * 1 pound each = 2 pounds
- 12-pound bag of carrots * 4 bags = 48 pounds
- 75-pound bale of hay * 42 bales = 3090 pounds
- 65-pound sack of oats * 20 sacks = 1300 pounds

Step 2: Find the total weight of all the feed.
Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3090 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
Total weight = 3432 pounds (sugars) + 3090 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 7722 pounds

Step 3: Divide the total weight by the capacity of the farmer's truck to find out how many trips are needed.
Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 7722 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip
Number of trips = 3.42 (rounded up to 4 since the farmer cannot take a fraction of a load)

{The final answer is: The farmer needs to make 4 trips to transport all the feed.}</s>","The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.

Given that Frederick has 10 plants, we can set up an equation and solve for x:

10 = x
1.6x = 10
x = 10 / 1.6 = 6.25 * 10 = 6.25 * 100 = 62.5

So Toni has 63 plants. Now we can find out how many plants Shondra has:

Step 1: Find the tip amount
Tip = 1/5 * Amount ordered
Tip = (1/5) * x

Step 2: Find the total amount Ashley needs to pay the delivery person
Total amount = Amount ordered + Tip
Total amount = x + (1/5) * x

To simplify the equation, we can combine the terms with x:

Total amount = x + (1/5) * x
Total amount = x + (1/5x)
Total amount = x + (x/5)

Step 3: Find the common factor of x in the terms x and x/5
The common factor of x is cancelled out:

Total amount = x + x/5

Step 4: Add the fractions by finding a common denominator (in this case, 5)
Total amount = x + (5x/5)/(1/5)

Step 5: Multiply the numerators and denominators to simplify the fraction
Total amount = x + (5x)
Total amount = 6x

Since the original amount ordered was x, the total amount Ashley should give to the delivery person including the tip is 6x dollars.

                    Miss Maria is ? a ; middle school teacher, and she loves to , collect sports cards. She has six decks . with 25 basketball cards in each ; deck : and five : boxes ; with 40 . baseball cards . in each ; box.

                 [/INST] To find the number of students Miss Maria has, we first need to determine the total number of cards she keeps for herself and the number of cards she gives to each student.

Step 1: Calculate the number of basketball cards Miss Maria has.
She has 6 decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck:
Total number of basketball cards = 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 cards

Step 2: Calculate the number of basketball cards Miss Maria gives to her students.
She keeps 50 basketball cards for herself:
Number of basketball cards given to students = Total number of basketball cards - Cards kept for herself = 150 cards - 50 cards = 100 cards

Step 3: Determine the number of baseball cards Miss Maria has.
She has 5 boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box:
Total number of baseball cards = 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 cards

Step 4: Calculate the number of baseball cards Miss Maria keeps for herself.
She keeps 50 cards in total, but we don't know how many of those are baseball cards:
Let's denote the number of baseball cards Miss Maria has as x.
Since each student gets 10 baseball cards, we know that (x - 50) is a multiple of 10.
The smallest multiple of 10 greater than 50 is 60. So, if Miss Maria has between 60 and 110 baseball cards, she will have x baseball cards.

We also know that x + 150 (her basketball cards) = Total number of cards = 350.

Now we have two equations:
x + 150 = 350
x is a multiple of 10 + 10

Let's solve the first equation for x:
x = 350 - 150 = 200

The number of baseball cards Miss Maria has is 200. Since it is a multiple of 10, this answers the question.

Step 5: Calculate the number of students.
Each student gets 10 baseball cards:
Number of students = (Total number of baseball cards given to students) / (Cards given to each student)
Number of students = (100 baseball cards) / (10 cards/student) = 10 students

{The final answer is: Miss Maria has 10 students}</s>","There are 6 x 25 = <<6*25=150>>150 basketball cards.
And, there are 5 x 40 = <<5*40=200>>200 baseball cards.
Thus, Miss Maria has 150 + 200 = <<150+200=350>>350 sports cards.
She gave a total of 350 - 50 = <<350-50=300>>300 cards to her students.
Therefore, Miss Maria has 300/10 = <<300/10=30>>30 students.

Cost of apples for Becky = $9.00

Step 2: Find the discount Becky received.
Becky received a $1 discount.

Step 3: Find the actual cost Becky paid for the apples after the discount.
Cost of apples for Becky after discount = Cost of apples for Becky - Discount
Cost of apples for Becky after discount = $9.00 - $1.00
Cost of apples for Becky after discount = $8.00

Step 4: Find the cost of apples Kelly bought.
Kelly bought 20 apples at $0.50 each.
Cost of apples for Kelly = 20 apples * $0.50/apple
Cost of apples for Kelly = $10.00

Step 5: Find the discount Kelly received.
Kelly received a 10% discount on the cost of her apples.
Discount for Kelly = $10.00 * 10%
Discount for Kelly = $1.00

Step 6: Find the actual cost Kelly paid for the apples after the discount.
Cost of apples for Kelly after discount = Cost of apples for Kelly - Discount
Cost of apples for Kelly after discount = $10.00 - $1.00
Cost of apples for Kelly after discount = $9.00

Step 7: Find the difference in the amount Becky and Kelly paid for the apples.
Difference = Cost of apples for Becky after discount - Cost of apples for Kelly after discount
Difference = $8.00 - $9.00
Difference = $1.00

{The final answer is: Becky paid $1 less than Kelly}</s>","Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is equal to 5 * 2 = 10 new shoes. So, the number of shoes Frank has on Monday is 200 (initial number) + 10 (new pairs) = 210.
2. On Wednesday, Frank gains 15 new pairs, so the number of shoes he has on Wednesday is 210 (Monday's number) + 15 (new pairs) = 225.
3. On Friday, Frank gains 30 new pairs, so the number of shoes he has on Friday is 225 (Wednesday's number) + 30 (new pairs) = 255.
4. On Saturday, Frank gets rid of 180 shoes, so the number of shoes he has on Sunday is 255 (Friday's number) - 180 (shoes gotten rid of) = 75.

{The final answer is: Fireman Frank has 75 pairs of shoes on Sunday.}</s>","If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300

Matt wants to have cookies as a snack, but his dad wants him to eat healthily and eats X number of carrot sticks before having cookies. Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies, how many carrot sticks does he need to eat?

Step 2: Translate the problem into an equation
Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as X. We know that the number of cookies Matt can have is N = 0.5X + 2. We are given that Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies.

Step 3: Find the value of X
To find the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, we need to isolate X in the equation N = 0.5X + 2. To do this, we'll first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation, giving us N = 0.5X. Then, we can divide both sides by 0.5 to get X = 2N.

Step 4: Check the solution
So, if Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies, he needs to eat X = 2N = 2 x 5 = 10 carrot sticks. This means that Matt will be able to have 0.5 * 10 + 2 = 6 cookies. Since he wanted 5 cookies in total, this solution satisfies the condition.

                 [/INST] To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, first, we need to find the total length of the shark with the remoras attached and the length of the remoras themselves.

Step 1: We know that the length of the shark is 10 feet, and we are given that each remora is 6 inches long. However, we don't have an exact number of remoras.

Step 2: Let's assume there are two remoras attached to the shark. Thus, the total length of the remoras would be 2 * 6 inches = 12 inches.

Step 3: Therefore, the total length of the shark with the remoras attached would be 10 feet + 12 inches = 120 inches.

Step 4: To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to divide the total length of the remoras by the total length of the shark, and then convert the result to a percentage.

Step 5: First, we convert all lengths to inches: 10 feet = 120 inches. We already have the remora length in inches.

Step 6: Now, we calculate the percentage: (Total length of remoras) / (Total length of shark) * 100%
= (12 inches) / (120 inches) * 100%

                 [/INST] To find the number of students at that grade level, we need to use the given information to set up and solve an equation. Here's how:

1. Let X represent the number of students at that grade level.
2. Three-fourths of X students have desktop computers at home, which means (3/4)X students have desktop computers.
3. The number of students without desktop computers is given as 20, so the number of students with desktop computers is X - 20.
4. We know that the number of students with desktop computers is equal to (3/4)X, so we can set up the equation: (3/4)X = X - 20
5. To solve the equation, we first get rid of the X term by adding 20 to both sides: (3/4)X = X - 20 + X = 2X - 20
6. Next, we isolate X by adding 20 to both sides: 3X = 40
7. Finally, we divide both sides by 3 to find X: X = 40 / 3 ≈ 133.33
8. Since we cannot have a fraction of a student, we must round this number up or down to the nearest whole number. Rounding down would mean that we're underestimating the number of students by about 3.33, while rounding up would mean we're overestimating by about the same amount.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Sarah went to the store to buy books. Let's find out how many books she bought.

Given: Sarah bought books and spent $300 on them.

Step 2: The price of each book is $15.

Step 3: Find out how many books Sarah bought with the given budget.

Let x be the number of books Sarah bought.

Then, the total cost of the books is $300, so we have:

15x = 300

To find the number of books, we need to divide both sides by 15:

x = 300 / 15
x ≈ 20

So, Sarah bought approximately 20 books.

Step 4: Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids.

Since she had about 20 books, each child should receive:

{The final answer is approximately 5 books}

Sarah gave each of her 4 kids approximately 5 books.</s>","Since she spent $300 on the books and each book's cost was $15, she bought $300/$15= <<300/15=20>>20 books.
If Sarah gave an equal number of books to each of her children, each kid received 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 books.

The normal price is $1500 per day, but it is 20% more expensive during the weekend. To find the cost during the anniversary weekend, we need to find 20% more than $1500.
20% of $1500 = 0.2 * $1500 = $300
So, the cost of the hotel per day during the anniversary weekend is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the hotel for the three-day trip.
The cost of the hotel per day during the anniversary weekend is $1800, and they will be there for three days.
Cost of hotel = $1800/day * 3 days = $5400

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the plane tickets.
The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and there are two tickets.
Total cost of plane tickets = $5000 * 2 = $10000

Step 4: Find the total cost of the trip.
Total cost of trip = Cost of hotel + Cost of plane tickets = $5400 + $10000 = $15400

1. We know that a 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.
2. The text states that a 2010 penny weighs three-quarters of the weight of a 1959 penny. So, we need to find three-quarters of 48 grains.
3. To find three-quarters of 48 grains, we need to multiply 48 by three-quarters: 48 × 3/4
4. Multiplying 48 by 3/4, we get 66 grains.
5. Since we know that the 2010 penny weighs 66 grains and the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we can find the combined weight by adding the two weights: 48 + 66
6. Adding 48 and 66, the final answer is 114 grains.

1. Uncle Ben has four horses.
2. Each horse requires 5 pounds of oats per meal. So, the total amount of oats needed for one meal for all horses is 4 horses * 5 pounds/horse = 20 pounds.
3. Uncle Ben feeds his horses twice a day, so the total amount of oats needed for a day is 20 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds.
4. To find out how many bags of oats he needs for one day, we divide the total amount of oats required in a day by the weight of one bag: 40 pounds/day ÷ 50 pounds/bag = 0.8 bags/day. Since he cannot buy a fraction of a bag, he must round up and buy 1 bag/day.
5. To calculate how many bags he needs for five days, we multiply the number of bags he needs per day by the number of days: 1 bag/day * 5 days = 5 bags.

{The final answer is: Uncle Ben needs 5 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.}</s>","The four horses can consume 4 x 5 pounds = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of oats per meal.
Thus, they can consume 2 x 20 pounds = <<2*20=40>>40 pounds of oats a day.
So, uncle Ben needs 5 x 40 pounds = <<5*40=200>>200 pounds of oats to fed his horses for five days.
Therefore, uncle Ben needs 200/50 = <<200/50=4>>4 bags of oats.

                 [/INST] To find the average highest temperature of Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia, we first need to find the individual averages of each country's highest temperature, and then find the overall average.

Step 1: Find the individual average highest temperatures for each country:

The highest temperature ever recorded in Southlandia: -48 degrees Fahrenheit
The highest temperature ever recorded in Northlandia: 21 degrees Fahrenheit
The highest temperature ever recorded in Midlandia: -3 degrees Fahrenheit

Average highest temperature in Southlandia: (-48 degrees Fahrenheit)
Average highest temperature in Northlandia: (21 degrees Fahrenheit)
Average highest temperature in Midlandia: (-3 degrees Fahrenheit)

Step 2: Calculate each country's average:

Average temperature for Southlandia = (-48 degrees Fahrenheit) / (Number of data points for Southlandia)
Since we have only one data point for Southlandia, the average is simply the highest temperature recorded, which is -48 degrees Fahrenheit.

Average temperature for Northlandia = (21 degrees Fahrenheit) / (Number of data points for Northlandia)
Since we have only one data point for Northlandia, the average is simply the highest temperature recorded, which is 21 degrees Fahrenheit.

Average temperature for Midlandia = (-3 degrees Fahrenheit) / (Number of data points for Midlandia)
Since we have only one data point for Midlandia, the average is simply the highest temperature recorded, which is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

Step 3: Find the overall average:

To find the overall average of the three countries, we add up the individual average highest temperatures and divide by the number of countries:

Overall average = (Average temperature for Southlandia + Average temperature for Northlandia + Average temperature for Midlandia) / (Number of countries)
Overall average = (-48 degrees Fahrenheit + 21 degrees Fahrenheit + (-3 degrees Fahrenheit)) / 3
Overall average = (20 degrees Fahrenheit) / 3

Step 4: Calculate the final answer:

Overall average =  Approximately 6.67 degrees Fahrenheit

However, since we can't have a temperature of a fraction of a degree, let's round up to the nearest whole number:

{The final answer is: Approximately 7 degrees Fahrenheit}</s>","-48 + 21 + (-3) = <<-48+21+(-3)=-30>>-30
-30/3 = <<-30/3=-10>>-10 degrees
The average highest temperature recorded in Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

1. The child wants to buy a toy car costing $12.
2. He already has $4 savings.
3. The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance.

To find out how many days it takes for the child to save the remaining amount ($12 - $4), follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount the child needs to save: $12 (for the toy car) - $4 (his current savings) = $8
2. Determine how long it will take for the child to save that amount, with a daily savings of $2: Days needed = Total savings needed / Savings per day

By applying this formula, the final answer is:

{The final answer is: Days needed = $8 / $2 = 4 days}

So, the child would need to save for an additional 4 days to buy the toy car.</s>","The boy still needs $12 - $4 = $<<12-4=8>>8.
If he saves $2 per day then it will take him $8 / $2/day = <<8/2=4>>4 days to save the remaining amount.

                 [/INST] To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on one tray with 24 capacity, first let's determine how many eggs each tray can hold:

1. Each tray can hold 24 eggs.

Now let's see how many eggs Jaime has:

2. Jaime has 64 eggs.

Since Jaime has two trays, we'll find out how many eggs can be placed on both trays first, then subtract that number from the total number of eggs Jaime has to find the remaining eggs that can't be placed.

3. The total number of eggs that can be placed on two trays is:
   Total eggs_capable = Capacity of one tray * Number of trays
   Total eggs_capable = 24 eggs * 2 trays
   Total eggs_capable = 48 eggs

4. Since Jaime has 64 eggs and 48 of them can be placed on the trays, the remaining eggs he won't be able to place are:
   Remaining_eggs = Total_eggs - Total_eggs_capable
   Remaining_eggs = 64 eggs - 48 eggs
   Remaining_eggs = 16 eggs

Cost of family-size pizza = Cost of small pizza * 3

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the family-size pizza.

Cost of family-size pizza = $8 * 3
Cost of family-size pizza = $24

Step 3: Add the cost of both pizzas to find the total amount spent by Sally.

                 [/INST] To find the height of the human pyramid, we need to determine the height of each layer in inches and then convert it to feet.

1. First, let's find the height of 4 girls on the bottom. Since there are 9 cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall, and 4 of them are on the bottom, the height of this layer is 4 * 64 = 256 inches. To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12: 256 inches / 12 inches/foot = 21.33 feet. So the bottom layer is about 21.33 feet tall.

2. Next, let's find the height of the middle layer with 3 girls. Each girl is 64 inches tall, so the total height of this layer is 3 * 64 = 192 inches. In feet this is 192 inches / 12 inches/foot = 16 feet.

3. The top layer consists of 2 girls, and the shortest girl (who is the one at the very top) is 60 inches tall. So their combined height is 2 * 64 + 60 = 128 + 60 = 188 inches or about 15.7 feet.

4. The final height of the human pyramid is the sum of the heights of all layers: 21.33 ft (bottom layer) + 16 ft (middle layer) + 15.7 ft (top layer). Adding the numbers: 21.33 ft + 16 ft + 15.7 ft = 43.03 ft.

1. Paul drives his car twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon.
2. He does this for 14 days.
3. The cost of a morning ride is $6.
4. The cost of an afternoon ride is $2.

First, let's find out how many rides Paul makes in a day:
He drives twice a day => 2 rides/day

Now, let's find out how many rides he makes in total during the 14-day period:
Total rides = Rides per day * Number of days => 2 rides/day * 14 days => 28 rides

Next, we calculate the total cost of Paul's morning rides:
Cost of morning rides = Number of morning rides * Cost per morning ride => 14 rides * $6/ride => $84

Similarly, we find the cost of Paul's afternoon rides:
Cost of afternoon rides = Number of afternoon rides * Cost per afternoon ride => 14 rides * $2/ride => $28

To find the total amount Paul spent on driving his car during the two weeks, we simply add the cost of his morning rides and his afternoon rides:

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ashley brought 5 boxes, and each box contains 10 oranges. Therefore, Ashley brought a total of 5 x 10 = <<5*10=50>>50 oranges.
2. Brianne brought oranges, which is 10 plus 20, so she brought a total of 30 more oranges than Ashley. Thus, Brianne brought 50 + 30 = <<50+30=80>>80 oranges.
3. One Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, so let's find out how many pies they can make with the total number of oranges they have between them.

First, let's find out how many pies Ashley can make:
Ashley can make pies = Total Oranges She Brought / Oranges per Pie
Ashley can make pies = 50 / 3

However, since they cannot make a fraction of a pie, let's find the next lowest number of pies they can make:

Int > 50/3
Int(50/3)=16.6667

So, since they cannot make 16.6667 pies, Ashley couldn't make exactly 16 pies with the oranges she brought. But they can make 16 pies if Ashley brings a few less oranges to have an exact multiple of the number of oranges required per pie.

Next, let's calculate how many pies Brianne can make with her oranges:
Brianne's pies = Total Oranges She Brought / Oranges per Pie
Brianne's pies = 80 / 3

This time around, Brianne can make a whole number of pies when using all of her oranges. So, without wasting any oranges or having to make a fraction of a pie, Brianne can make pies = 26 and Ashley could make pies = 16. In total, they can make pies = <<16+26=42>>42 Greek orange pies. {The final answer is 42}</s>","Ashley brought 5 x 10 = <<5*10=50>>50 oranges.

                 [/INST] To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to have equal cost, we need to calculate the total cost for a given number of guests at each venue and then find the number of guests where the costs are equal.

First, let's calculate the cost for each venue with a given number of guests:

1. First venue:
Cost = Flat fee + Food cost per person * Number of guests
Cost = $200 + $5 * Number of guests

2. Second venue:
Cost = Fee per person * Number of guests
Cost = $25 * Number of guests

Now, we want to find the number of guests where the costs are equal. Let x be the number of guests at both venues, so we have:

$200 + $5x = $25x

To solve for x, first subtract 5x from both sides:

$195x = $200

Divide both sides by $195:

x ≈ $200 / $195 ≈ 1.0326 * Number of guests at the second venue

Since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we need to round up or down to the nearest whole number. Rounding down would result in the first venue being cheaper, and rounding up would result in the second venue being cheaper. However, we want to find the number of guests where both venues have equal cost.

Since the first venue charges a flat fee, it is cheaper for smaller guest lists, meaning we need to round up to the next whole number for the second venue to have equal or greater cost. Let's round up to x + 1.

$200 + $5(x + 1) = $25x

Solving for x:

$200 + $5(x + 1) = $25x
$200 + $5x + $5 = $25x
$200 = $20x
x = $200 / $20 = 10

So, the final answer is: {11 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost} (Since the first venue only accommodates 10 guests with $200, the second venue with 11 guests will have equal or greater cost).</s>","The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects.
2. Lily collected 7 more insects than David did. Since David collected x insects, then Lily collected (x + 7) insects.
3. We're also told that David found half the number of insects that Bodhi did. Let's represent the number of insects Bodhi found as y. So, David found y/2 insects.

We have two equations based on the given information:

- Lily + David + Bodhi = 43
- Lily = David + 7
- David = y/2

Now, let's solve these equations for the unknown variable y (the number of insects Bodhi found):

Step 1: Substitute the equation for Lily and David in terms of y (Lily = y/2 + y/2 + y, which simplifies to Lily = 3y/2 and David = y/2) in the first equation:

3y/2 + y/2 + y = 43

Step 2: Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fractions:

3y + y + 2y = 86

Step 3: Simplify by combining like terms:

6y = 86

Step 4: Divide both sides by 6 to find the value of y:

y = 14.33 (approximately)

Since it's not possible to collect an approximate number of insects, there might have been a mistake in the problem statement or some missing information.

Without a valid value for y (the number of insects Bodhi found), it's impossible to determine the number of insects Lily found (which is given as Lily = y + 7).

Therefore, we cannot find the exact answer to the question.
{The final answer is: The problem does not have a valid solution as it contains an approximation for an integer solution.}</s>","Let B = the number of insects Bodhi collected
David = B/2
Lily = B/2 + 7
B + B + 7 = 43
2B = <<36=36>>36
B = <<18=18>>18 insects
David = 18/2 = <<18/2=9>>9 insects
Lily = 9 + 7 = <<9+7=16>>16 insects
Lily found <<16=16>>16 insects.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the amount of yarn Mariah used.
Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. There are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, so the amount of yarn Mariah used is:
Mariah's yarn = (1/4) * 364 yards

Step 2: Find the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used.
Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. So the amount of yarn she used is:
Grandma's yarn = (1/2) * 364 yards

Step 3: Find the total amount of yarn used by both.
Total yarn = Mariah's yarn + Grandma's yarn

Substitute the values we found in the previous steps:
Total yarn = (1/4 * 364) + (1/2 * 364)

Step 4: Solve the equation to find the total amount of yarn used.
First, we need to solve the fractions:
Mariah's yarn = 0.25 * 364 = 91 yards
Grandma's yarn = 0.5 * 364 = 182 yards

Now, add the two amounts of yarn:
Total yarn = 91 yards + 182 yards
Total yarn = 273 yards

{The final answer is 273 yards}.</s>","Mariah’s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.
Now that there are common denominators, we can add the 1/4 skein of yarn Mariah used + 2/4 skein of yarn her grandma used = 3/4 of a skein of yarn.
3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = <<3/4*364=273>>273 yards.

Step 2: Solve for the length of the couch.
- Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 feet = 16 feet.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store.
2. She bought two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry, which cost $2 per pack.
3. She bought one pack of green apple gum, which cost half as much as a pack of grape gum, and a pack of grape gum, which cost $2.

Let's find the cost of the grape gum pack first:

4. We know that Suzie paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and $7 in total. So, the cost of the green apple gum pack is half the cost of the grape gum pack.
5. Thus, the cost of the green apple gum pack is $2 * 0.5 = $1.

Now, let's find out how much Suzie paid for the two packs of strawberry gum:

6. Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum and paid $7 in total for all four packs. So, the cost of one pack of strawberry gum is $7 / 2 = $3.5.

Therefore, the final answer is: Each pack of strawberry gum costs $3.5.</s>","The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.
Thus, the two packs of strawberry gum cost 7 - 2 - 1 = $<<7-2-1=4>>4.
Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost 4 / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.

What ? is ! the most ; popsicle sticks he , can make : if he . buys the cheapest lumber?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of sticks Frederick can make from a 2 x 4 and a 2 x 8 piece of wood.

- From a 2 x 4: 2 (width) * 4 (length) * 1 (thickness) = 8 sticks per piece
- From a 2 x 8: 2 (width) * 8 (length) * 1 (thickness) = 16 sticks per piece

Step 2: Determine how many sticks Frederick can make with his budget if he buys only 2 x 4 pieces of wood.

- The cost of a 2 x 4 piece is $4, so he can buy 24 ($24 / $4) pieces
- The number of sticks Frederick can make from 24 2 x 4 pieces is 24 * 8 = 192 sticks

Step 3: Determine how many sticks Frederick can make with his budget if he buys a combination of 2 x 4 and 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

- The cost of a 2 x 4 piece is $4, and the cost of a 2 x 8 piece is $6
- Frederick has $24, so we have to find the combination that gives us the most sticks

To find the combination with the most sticks, let x be the number of 2x4 pieces and y be the number of 2x8 pieces.
The equation representing the total number of sticks and total cost is:
8x + 16y = Total sticks
4x + 6y = Total Budget ($24)

Step 4: Solve the system of equations:
We have 2 equations and 2 unknowns:
First equation: 8x + 16y = Total sticks
Second equation: 4x + 6y = $24

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:
4x = Total sticks - 16y
Or x = (Total sticks - 16y) / 4

We need to find the integer values of x and y that maximize the total number of sticks. To find the solution, we can try different combinations of x and y while checking the total number of sticks is an integer value.

For instance, if x = 3 and y = 0:
8*3 = 24, 16*0 = 0
Total sticks = 24
This combination doesn't work since x must be a non-negative integer.

Another example is when x = 0 and y = 4:
8*0 + 16*4 = 64
Total sticks = 64
This combination is not optimal since it doesn't maximize the sticks.

We found that this is a linear programming problem with integer variables; finding the optimal solution requires more advanced methods, such as the simplex method or branch-and-bound. However, we can observe that if Frederick buys only 2x4 pieces, he can make 192 sticks. Therefore:

{The final answer is 192 popsicle sticks.}</s>","He can buy six 2 x 4's because 24 / 4 = <<24/4=6>>6

He can buy four 2 x 8's because 24 / 6 = <<24/6=4>>4
He can make 1600 sticks from this because 4 x 400 = <<4*400=1600>>1600
He can make 1600 sticks if he buys the cheapest lumber because 1600 > 1200

                 [/INST] To find out how much it costs Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his 6 sled dogs, we first need to determine how many pairs of snowshoes he needs to buy. Since there are 6 dogs and each dog requires snowshoes for all 4 of its legs, we need to buy snowshoes for a total of 4 legs per dog. Therefore, we need to buy 4 pairs of snowshoes for each dog.

So, the number of pairs of snowshoes Mario needs to buy is equal to the number of dogs multiplied by the number of pairs of snowshoes per dog:

6 dogs * 4 pairs of snowshoes per dog = <<6*4=24>>24 pairs of snowshoes

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to buy 24 pairs of snowshoes. The cost of a pair of snowshoes is given as $12.00.

Therefore, the total cost of buying snowshoes for all 6 sled dogs is:

$12.00 per pair * 24 pairs = $<<12*24=288>>288.00

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of Janet's bus trips in a week without the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips everyday, so the number of bus trips in a week is 2 (trips per day) * 7 (days in a week) = 14 bus trips in a week.

The cost of one bus trip is $2.20. So, the total cost of her bus trips in a week is 14 (bus trips) * $2.20 (cost per trip) = $30.80.

Step 2: Calculate the saving from buying a weekly bus pass.

Janet pays $30.80 for her bus trips in a week without the weekly pass. However, she can buy a weekly bus pass for $20. The savings she would make by doing this is the difference between what she currently spends on bus trips and the cost of the weekly pass, i.e., $30.80 - $20 = $10.80.

{The final answer is: Janet would save $10.80 per week by buying a weekly bus pass.}</s>","First find the total number of trips Janet takes during the week: 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = <<2*5=10>>10 trips/week
Then multiply this number by the cost per trip to find her current weekly spending: 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $<<10*2.20=22>>22/week
Then subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from this number to find her savings: $22/week - $20/week = $<<22-20=2>>2

Cows in the zoo = 2 * Cows in the farm

Step 2: We know that the farm has 30 cows, so:

Cows in the farm = 30
Cows in the zoo = 2 * 30 = 60

Step 3: Next, let's find out how many sheep the farm has. We know that the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so:

Sheep in the farm = Sheep in the zoo / 2

Step 4: We know that the zoo has 20 sheep, so:

Sheep in the farm = 20 / 2 = 10
Sheep in the zoo = 20

Step 5: To find the total number of animals in the farm and zoo, we add the number of cows and sheep for both:

Total animals = Cows in the farm + Cows in the zoo + Sheep in the farm + Sheep in the zoo
Total animals = 30 + 60 + 10 + 20 = 120

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought as x and y respectively.
Step 2: We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, so the number of onions Rose bought is 4x, and the number of potatoes Rose bought is 4y.
Step 3: We're given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so we can set up the following system of equations:
    x    : number of onions Sophia bought
    4x   : number of onions Rose bought
     y    : number of potatoes Sophia bought
    4y   : number of potatoes Rose bought

Step 4: We have two equations and four variables, so we need to find two more equations to solve the system.
Step 5: Since we're given that the total number of onions Sophia and Rose bought is the sum of the number of onions they each bought, we can write the equation: x + 4x = 12

Step 6: Simplifying the equation, we get 5x = 12, which means x = 12/5 = 2.4. However, since we can't buy a fraction of an onion, this means there's an error in the problem or our understanding of it.

Step 7: Let's assume instead that Rose bought 2 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, so the number of onions Rose bought is 2x, and the number of potatoes Rose bought is 2y.

Step 8: We're still given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so we can set up the following system of equations:
    x    : number of onions Sophia bought
    2x   : number of onions Rose bought
     y    : number of potatoes Sophia bought
    2y   : number of potatoes Rose bought

Step 9: We have 4 equations and 4 variables, so the system is now solvable.

                 [/INST] To find out how much calorie deficit Andy needs each day to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs. by July 19th, we first need to determine the number of days he has to reach his goal.

1. First, let's calculate the number of days between December 31st and July 19th.

The number of days in a year is 365. subtracting the number of days in December (31), and adding the number of days in July (19), gives us the number of days between those two dates:

days_between_december_and_july = 365 - 31 + 19 = 338

2. However, we've overlooked the fact that a new year has started, adding an extra day, so we need to increment the number of days by 1:

total_days = 338 + 1 = 339

3. Now, we can calculate the number of days Andy has to lose the 30 lbs. Since 1 lb = 3500 calories:

calories_to_lose = 30 lbs. * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

Now that we know Andy needs to lose a total of 105,000 calories, we can calculate the required calorie deficit per day:

calorie_deficit_per_day = total_calories_to_lose / total_days = 105,000 calories / 339 days = 310,158.83 calories (approximately)

However, we cannot set a negative calorie intake, so it's recommended to limit our calorie deficit to a healthier range of 500 calories per day. Therefore, instead of striving for exact, we recommend aiming for a calorie deficit of around 500 calories per day to reach Andy's goal safely and healthily. {The final answer is: Andy needs to aim for a daily calorie deficit of approximately 500 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs. by July 19th.}</s>","January, March, and May have 31 days, February has 28, and April and June have 30, and Andy's birthday is on the 19th day of July. So there are 3 * 31 days + 28 + 2 * 30 days + 19 days = 93 days + 28 + 60 days + 19 days = <<3*31+28+2*30+19=200>>200 days until Andy's birthday.
He wants to lose 30 lbs. At 3500 calories per pound, this is 30 * 3500 = <<30*3500=105000>>105,000 calories total,
To reach his goal, he will have to burn 105,000 calories / 200 days = <<105000/200=525>>525 calories per day more than he consumes.

1. Gerald earns $30 every day. So, in a week (7 days), he earns: $30/day * 7 days = $210
2. Gerald spent a total of $100. So, the amount he has left is the difference between what he earned and what he spent: $210 (what he earned) - $100 (what he spent)

The final answer is: Gerald has $110 left.</s>","He earns $30 daily for a week (7 days) for a total earnings of $30*7 = $<<30*7=210>>210

Step 2: One lap is 0.25 km long.

Step 3: Hannah is told to run 8 laps in total.

Step 4: To find the total distance Hannah runs, we can multiply the number of laps by the length of one lap: 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km.

Step 5: Since Hannah needs 60 ml of water for every kilometer she runs, the total amount of water she needs for 2 km can be found by multiplying the distance in kilometers by the amount of water she needs per kilometer: 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml.

The final answer is: Hannah will need to drink 120 ml of water.</s>","First find the total number of kilometers Hannah runs: 8 laps * .25 km/lap = <<8*.25=2>>2 km

                 [/INST] To find out how much money Julie had left, we first need to find out how much she spent on clothes and CDs using the given percentages.

1. Julie had $500. She spent 20% of it on clothes:
   Money spent on clothes = (Percentage spent on clothes) * (Total amount of money) / 100
   Money spent on clothes = (0.2) * ($500) / 100
   Money spent on clothes = $100

2. She then spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs:
   First, we find the amount of money she had left after buying clothes:
   Money left = Total amount of money - Money spent on clothes
   Money left = $500 - $100
   Money left = $400

   Now we find how much she spent on CDs:
   Money spent on CDs = (Percentage spent on CDs) * (Remaining money) / 100
   Money spent on CDs = (0.25) * ($400) / 100
   Money spent on CDs = $100

3. Subtract the money spent on clothes and CDs to find the total amount of money Julie spent:
   Total amount spent = Money spent on clothes + Money spent on CDs
   Total amount spent = $100 + $100
   Total amount spent = $200

4. Finally, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount Julie had to find the amount of money left:
   Money left = Initial amount of money - Total amount spent
   Money left = $500 - $200

The final answer is: Julie had $300 left.</s>","Julie spend $500 * 0.2 = $<<500*0.2=100>>100 for clothes.

                    A house and , a lot cost ? $120,000. ? If the , house . cost three times as much as the lot, how much . did ? the house cost?
                 [/INST] To find out the cost of the house and lot together, and then the cost of the house, we need to use the given information that the house costs three times as much as the lot.

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. According to the problem, the cost of the house and lot together is $120,000.

x (cost of the lot) + house = $120,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can express the cost of the house as 3x. Substituting this expression into the equation above, we get:

x + 3x = $120,000

Combining the terms with x, we have:

4x = $120,000

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:

x = $30,000

So, the lot costs $30,000. To find the cost of the house, we can now use the expression we found earlier:

house = 3x
house = 3 * $30,000
house = $90,000

{The final answer is: The house costs $90,000 and the lot costs $30,000.}</s>","Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.
The cost of the house is 3/4 of the total cost, which is $120,000. 3/4 * $120,000 = $<<3/4*120000=90000>>90,000.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought.
- She bought 8 packs of 5 bags in each pack.
- Each pack cost $4.
- So, the total cost of the bags is: 8 packs * 5 bags/pack * $4/pack = $<<8*5*4=160>>160.

Step 2: Calculate the selling price of each painted bag.
- She sold each painted bag for $8.

Step 3: Calculate the profit per bag.
- The profit per bag is the difference between the selling price and the cost price.
- Profit per bag = Selling price - Cost price.
- Profit per bag = $8 - $<<5>>2 (cost price is not explicitly stated in the problem but since Tara bought the bags for $2 each and spent $4 on painting, it is reasonable to assume that she sold the painted bags for 2 dollars more than what she paid for the initial bags. So the cost price for each bag is $2.)
- Profit per bag = $8 - $2 = $<<8-2=6>>6.

Step 4: Calculate the total profit.
- To find the total profit, multiply the profit per bag with the number of bags sold.
- Total profit = Profit per bag * Number of bags sold.
- Total profit = $6/bag * Number of bags sold.

Since the number of bags sold is not given in the problem and we don't have enough information to find it, we cannot calculate the exact total profit.

{The final answer is: The total profit cannot be determined without the number of bags sold.}</s>","The total number of bags is 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40

J = 0.25S (Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made)

We're given that Suzanne made 36 cookies. So, we can find the number of cookies Kelsie made using the given information:

First, find the number of cookies Josh made:
J = 0.25 * S

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the total amount of money Ali has.
Ali has 4 $10 bills, so he has 4 * $10 = $40 in $10 bills.
He has 6 $20 bills, so he has 6 * $20 = $120 in $20 bills.
Therefore, Ali has a total of $40 (from $10 bills) + $120 (from $20 bills) = $160.

Step 2: Find the amount of money Ali gives to his sister.
Ali gives his sister half of his total money, so he gives $160 * 1/2 = $80.

Step 3: Find the amount of money Ali has left after giving it to his sister.
Ali has a total of $160, and he gave his sister $80, so he has $160 - $80 = $80 left.

Step 4: Find the amount of money Ali spends on dinner.
Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money for dinner. So he spends $80 * 3/5 = $120 on dinner.

Step 5: Find the amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner.
Ali has a total of $80, and he spends $120 on dinner, so he has $80 - $120 = $<-40>. However, this number is not valid since Ali cannot have a negative amount of money.
There is an error in the problem statement, as Ali doesn't have enough money to both give his sister half and buy dinner using 3/5 of the remaining amount.

{The final answer cannot be determined due to an error in the problem statement.}</s>","Four $10 bills have a value of 4*$10 =$<<4*10=40>>40
The six $20 bills also are worth 6*$20 = $<<6*20=120>>120
Ali has $40+$120 = $<<40+120=160>>160
When he gives his sister half of the money, he remains with the other half, which totals 1/2*$160 = $<<1/2*160=80>>80

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house.
2. Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time.

First, let's convert Rob's time from hours to minutes. We know that 1 hour = 60 minutes, so:

Rob's time = 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Next, let's find out how long it takes Royce to shingle the same house. We know that he takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time:

Royce's time = 2 * Rob's time + 40 minutes
We know that Rob's time is 120 minutes, so:

Royce's time = 2 * 120 minutes + 40 minutes = 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

To make this answer more clear, let's convert it back to hours:

280 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4.67 hours

Since we started with a problem that involved hours, it's a good idea to stick with hours for our final answer. Here's how the calculation looks with hours:

Rob takes 2 hours, so Royce takes 2 hours * 2 + 20 minutes = 4 hours 40 minutes = 4.73 hours (approximately)

                 [/INST] To find out how many skeins of wool Martha needs to buy for all three grandchildren, we first need to calculate the number of skeins required to make one set of each item (hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks).

1. Hats: 2 skeins
2. Scarfs: 4 skeins
3. Sweaters: 12 skeins
4. Mittens: 1 skein for a pair = 2 skeins in total
5. Socks: 2 skeins for a pair = 6 skeins in total

Now that we have the number of skeins required for one set of items for one grandchild, we can multiply this by the number of grandchildren (3) to find the total number of skeins needed.

1. For one grandchild: hats (2), scarf (4), sweater (12), mittens (2), socks (6), total = 2 + 4 + 12 + 2 + 6 = 26 skeins
2. For three grandchildren: total = 26 * 3 = 78 skeins of wool.

                 [/INST] To find out how many loaves of bread the bakers had left after accounting for the loaves baked, sold, and returned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning and afternoon separately.
2. Find the total number of loaves sold.
3. Determine how many loaves were baked on Monday morning.
4. Subtract the total number of loaves sold from the number baked to find out how many loaves were left.

Step 1: Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning and afternoon.
Morning sales = 93 loaves
Afternoon sales = 39 loaves

Step 2: Find the total number of loaves sold.
Total sales = Morning sales + Afternoon sales
Total sales = 93 + 39
Total sales = 132 loaves

Step 3: Determine how many loaves were baked on Monday morning.
Number of loaves baked = 200

Step 4: Subtract the total number of loaves sold from the number baked to find out how many loaves were left.
Loaves remaining = Number of loaves baked - Total sales - Returned loaves
Loaves remaining = 200 - 132 - 6

{The final answer is: 62 loaves}</s>","The Bakery sold 93 + 39 = <<93+39=132>>132 loaves.
The Bakery made 200 loaves and sold 132, leaving 200 - 132 = <<200-132=68>>68 loaves remaining.
The grocery store returned 6 loaves, so there were 6 + 68 = <<6+68=74>>74 loaves left.

                 [/INST] To find out how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant with the given number of red and blue tulips, we first need to determine how many tulips can be planted in one row of each color.

1. Red tulips: Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
2. Blue tulips: Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.

Now let's calculate how many tulips Jackson has in total and see if he has enough to plant only full rows.

3. Total amount of red tulips: Jackson buys 36 red tulips.
4. Total amount of blue tulips: Jackson buys 24 blue tulips.

First, let's find out how many full rows Jackson can plant with red tulips.

5. Number of full rows of red tulips: 36 red tulips / 6 red tulips per row = 6 full rows

Next, let's find out how many full rows Jackson can plant with blue tulips.

6. Number of full rows of blue tulips: 24 blue tulips / 8 blue tulips per row = 3 full rows

Since both colors have enough tulips to plant full rows, Jackson will plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips in total.

{The final answer is: Jackson will plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips, making a total of 9 rows.}</s>","First, divide the number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row: 36 / 6 = <<36/6=6>>6 rows.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem.
Heather has a jumbo bag of raisins containing 27 cups. She wants to use the raisins to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. A batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 cup of raisins. The problem asks how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the three types of recipes.

Step 2: Determine the amount of raisins used in each type of recipe.
- Oatmeal cookies: 3/4 cup
- Granola and snack mix: The problem does not provide enough information about the amount of raisins used in granola and snack mix.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of raisins used in making oatmeal cookies.
Since one batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 cup of raisins, the total amount required to make a certain number of batches (x) can be calculated as: 3/4 * x

Step 4: Determine the total amount of raisins in the bag.
Heather's bag of raisins contains 27 cups of raisins.

Step 5: Find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made.
To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to find the value of x in the equation 3/4 * x = 27.
Solving this equation, we find that Heather can make 18 batches of oatmeal cookies.

Step 6: Conclude
The final answer is: Heather can make 18 batches of oatmeal cookies using the 27 cups of raisins.

However, since the problem does not provide enough information about the amount of raisins used in making granola and snack mix, we can only determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made from the given amount of raisins.</s>","Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate Ada's daily electric consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).We know that Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kW, so:

Daily consumption = 12 kW * 24 hours
= 288 kWh

Step 2: Calculate Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device.
We know that there are 7 days in a week, so:

Weekly consumption before = 288 kWh/day * 7 days
= 2016 kWh

Step 3: Calculate the daily electric consumption of the new device.
The new device consumes 2 kW per hour, so:

Daily consumption of new device = 2 kW * 24 hours
= 48 kWh

Step 4: Calculate Ada's weekly electric consumption after adding the new device.

Weekly consumption after = (288 kWh/day + 48 kWh/day) * 7 days
= 2292 kWh

Step 5: Calculate the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device.

Difference = Weekly consumption after - Weekly consumption before
= (2292 kWh - 2016 kWh)
= 276 kWh

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the difference in electric bill.

Cost difference = 276 kWh * $1.50/kWh
= $414.50

{The final answer is: $414.50}</s>","Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.
So, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.
So her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.
Ada's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147
Therefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.

                 [/INST] To find out how many hours it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house, we first need to find out how long it takes one person to paint half a house and then use that information to determine how long it takes 5 people to paint a whole house.

First, let's calculate how long it takes one person to paint half a house. We're given that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. Let's assume that each day is 8 hours long for the purpose of this calculation (keeping in mind that this may not be the actual working hours in a day).

Time to paint half a house by one person = Days * Hours per day
Time to paint half a house by one person = 5 * 8
Time to paint half a house by one person = 40 hours

Since half a house is equivalent to one-third of a whole house (as each half represents one-third of the whole), we'll multiply the time taken to paint half a house by 3 to find out how long it would take to paint a whole house.

Time to paint a whole house by one person = Time to paint half a house * 3
Time to paint a whole house by one person = 40 hours * 3
Time to paint a whole house by one person = 120 hours

Now, let's find out how long it would take 5 people to paint a whole house. As each person is painting the same area, their individual contributions are additive.

Time to paint a whole house by 5 people = (Time to paint a whole house by one person) / Number of Painters
Time to paint a whole house by 5 people = (120 hours) / 5
Time to paint a whole house by 5 people = 24 hours

So, it would take 5 people a total of 24 hours to paint a whole house. However, this is just the time spent on the labor itself. To find the total number of hours required, factoring in breaks and other aspects, we'd need to have more data.

Therefore, the answer to how many hours it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house is 24 hours, assuming they're each working at the same pace as one person. Keep in mind that this calculation doesn't take other factors, such as rest breaks, into consideration.

{The final answer is 24 hours.}</s>","First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.
Since five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas and Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Let's find out how many chairs Jenna has.

Ophelia has 20 sofas.
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so:
Jenna's chairs = Ophelia's sofas * 3
Jenna's chairs = 20 * 3
Jenna's chairs = 60

Step 2: We've established that Ophelia and Jenna each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Let's find out how many sofas each of them has based on the number of chairs they have.

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, and Jenna has 60 chairs (3 times as many as Ophelia), and each has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:

Ophelia's chairs = 20 + 2 = 22
Ophelia has 22 chairs and given that she has 20 sofas, she has:
Ophelia's sofas = Ophelia's chairs - (2 * Ophelia's chairs / 3)
Ophelia's sofas = 22 - (2 * 22 / 3)
Ophelia's sofas = 22 - 14
Ophelia's sofas = 8

Jenna has 60 chairs and we know she has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, therefore:
Jenna's sofas = 20 * 3 = 60

Step 3: Add up the number of sofas both Ophelia and Jenna have to find the total number of sofas in the apartment building they live in.

Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas
Total sofas = 8 + 60
Total sofas = 68

So, the total number of sofas in the apartment building that Ophelia and Jenna live in is 68.</s>","If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, a total of 3*22 = <<3*22=66>>66 chairs
The total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 66+22 = <<66+22=88>>88
Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the total number of sofas she has is 66-2 = <<66-2=64>>64 sofas.
The total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is 64+20 = <<64+20=84>>84 sofas

                 [/INST] To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought instead of the headphone set, we first need to find out how much the headphone set cost and then subtract that amount from the total amount Tom paid.

1. Tom bought x CDs for $4 each, so the cost of the CDs was 4x.
2. He also bought a headphone set for $xx, so the cost of the headphone set was $xx.
3. In total, Tom paid $48 for both the CDs and the headphone set, so we have the equation: 4x + $xx = $48
4. To find the cost of the headphone set, we need to determine the number of CDs Tom bought. We can do this by rearranging the equation: 4x = $44 (subtracting $4 from both sides and dividing by 4).
5. Solving for x, we get x = $11. Therefore, Tom bought 3 CDs ($3 each).
6. So the cost of the headphone set was $45 (subtracting $12 from the total cost).
7. To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought instead of the headphone set, we subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total cost and divide by the cost of each CD.
8. That is, (total cost - cost of headphone set) / cost of each CD = (($48) - ($45)) / ($4) => 3 CDs.

{The final answer is: Tom could have bought an additional 3 CDs.}</s>","The headphone set cost was 48 - 4 = $<<48-4=44>>44.

1. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so 40 passengers (48 initial passengers – 8 who got off) stay on the bus.
2. At this stop, 5 times as many passengers get on, so an additional 40 passengers get on the bus (8 passengers who got off * 5).
3. Therefore, after the first stop, there are 80 passengers on the bus (40 who stayed on + 40 who got on).
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so 59 passengers (80 initial passengers after the first stop – 21 who got off) stay on the bus.
5. At this stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on, which equals 17 passengers (59 passengers who stayed * ⅓).

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find Jame's current age by determining how old he will be in 5 years.
Current age of Jame = Future age (27) - Age increase (5)
Current age of Jame = 27 - 5
Current age of Jame = 22

Step 2: Find the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years.
Age of cousin (in 8 years) = (Cousin's age in current year) * 2 + 5 - 5
Since the problem does not provide the current age of the cousin, we cannot determine this step.

Step 3: Find the age difference between Jame and his cousin when they are both 25 (Jame is 22 now).
When they are both 25, Jame's age will be 25, and his cousin's age will be 25 - 5 = 20.
Difference in age = Jame's age (25) - Cousin's age (20) = 5 years.

Step 4: Find the current age of Jame's cousin.
Current age of cousin = Cousin's age (at future time) - Age increase (8)
From step 3, we know the difference in age between Jame and his cousin when they are both 25 is 5 years. Since Jame is currently 22, we can find the current age of his cousin by subtracting Jame's current age (22) from the expected age difference (5) and then finding the cousin's age at that point in time with the given age increase of 8 years.

Current age of cousin = 25 - (25 - 5) - 8
Current age of cousin = 18

                 [/INST] To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to determine the number of seashells the boys brought and then find out how many seashells the girls brought.

1. We know that twenty kids went on a school trip and participated in a scavenger hunt for seashells. They were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.

2. The boys went out for the search and each boy brought back 60 shells.

3. The girls brought an amount of shells equal to the number of shells the boys brought, plus four times as many seashells as the boys brought.

Let's denote the number of seashells each boy brought as x. Since there were 10 boys and each boy brought 60 shells, the total number of seashells the boys brought is 10x.

According to the problem, the girls brought the same number of seashells as the boys plus four times as many. So, the total number of seashells the girls brought is 10x + 4x = 14x.

Since there were 10 girls and the total number of seashells they brought is 14x, to find the number of seashells each girl brought, we need to divide the total number of seashells the girls brought by the number of girls: 14x ÷ 10 = 1.4x.

Therefore, each girl brought 1.4 times as many seashells as each boy. Since each boy brought 60 seashells, each girl brought 1.4 * 60 = 84 seashells.

To summarize, the final answer is that each girl brought 84 seashells.</s>","When they divided, each group had 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 students.
The total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10*60 = <<10*60=600>>600
The girls brought four times more seashells than the boys, which is 4*600 = <<4*600=2400>>2400
The total number of seashells brought by the girls is 2400+600 = <<2400+600=3000>>3000
If there were 10 girls, then each girl brought 3000/10 = <<3000/10=300>>300 seashells

1. George started with G candies and ate 5 candies, so now he has G - 5 candies left.

2. We're told that George now has 3 candies left. So, G - 5 = 3.

3. Solving this equation for G, we find that G = 8.

4. Since Nick started with twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies initially.

Step 2: Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. So, we can calculate her age by subtracting the number of years she is younger from Chenny's age:

Age of Alyana = Age of Chenny - Age difference
Age of Alyana = 10 - 4
Age of Alyana = 6 years

Step 3: Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we can calculate her age by adding the number of years she is older to Alyana's age:

Age of Anne = Age of Alyana + Age difference
Age of Anne = 6 + 2
Age of Anne = 8 years

- The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 62 mm thick (31 mm x 2).

Step 2: Add up the thicknesses of all the books.
Total thickness = Thickness of first book + Thickness of second book + Thickness of third book + Thickness of fourth book
Total thickness = 31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm

1. Determine the cost of the dinner bill.
   The dinner bill is $50.

2. Calculate the amount your wife will pay for the dinner bill.
   To evenly split the bill, each person pays half of it. So, your wife will pay $50 / 2 = $25.

3. Find out the amount you'll pay for the dinner bill.
   Since you'll pay the double amount of what your wife pays, you'll contribute $25 * 2 = $50 for the dinner bill.

4. Calculate the tip amount.
   A 20% tip on a $50 dinner bill is $50 * 0.2 = $10.

5. Add the tip amount to the cost of the dinner bill to find your total payment.
   Your total payment will be $50 for the dinner bill + $10 for the tip = $60.

Since there are 3 boys and the total amount is $18, the share of each boy is $18 / 3 = $6.

Step 2: Determine the eldest boy's initial share and the amounts he added.
The eldest boy started with a share of $6. He added $5 the first day, so his share became $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he added an additional $10, so his new share was $11 + $10 = $21.

Step 3: Calculate the amount the eldest boy spent and saved.
The eldest boy spent $8, so he had $21 - $8 = $13 left after spending money. To triple the remaining amount, he saved and grew it to $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the eldest boy's final amount is {$39}.</s>","Each boy gets $18/3 = $<<18/3=6>>6.

We know that there are 30 days in a normal April, so we can divide the number of days into two equal halves:

Number of days in the first half = 30/2 = 15 days

To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the first half, we'll divide his monthly saving target by the number of days in the first half:

Elvis's saving target per day in the first half = $1125 / 15 days = $75.07 (rounded)

Now, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half compared to the first half. So, we'll find out how much he needs to save each day in the second half:

Elvis's saving target per day in the second half = $75.07 * 2 = $150.14 (rounded)

{The final answer is: Elvis needs to save $150.14 each day in the second half of the month to reach his monthly saving target.}</s>","Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the fruits that Verna bought.

Cost of apples = Number of apples * Price per apple
Cost of apples = 3 * $1.50
Cost of apples = $4.50

Cost of oranges = Number of oranges * Price per orange
Cost of oranges = 5 * $0.80
Cost of oranges = $4.00

Cost of peaches = Number of peaches * Price per peach
Cost of peaches = 6 * $0.75
Cost of peaches = $4.50

Total cost of fruits = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
Total cost of fruits = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50
Total cost of fruits = $13.00

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the total cost of fruits and the amount of money Verna spent ($20).

Change in money = Total cost of fruits - Money spent
Change in money = $13.00 - $20.00
Change in money = -$7.00

{The final answer is: Verna received a change of $7.00.}

Note: The minus sign indicates that Verna actually paid more than the cost of the fruits, hence she received change.

   Number of tasks = 20
   Total earnings for Jairus = Earnings per task * Number of tasks
   Total earnings for Jairus = $0.8 * 20 = $16

2. Jenny's earnings for completing 20 tasks:
   Earnings per task for Jenny = $0.5
   Number of tasks for Jenny = 20
   Total earnings for Jenny = Earnings per task * Number of tasks
   Total earnings for Jenny = $0.5 * 20 = $10

3. Now we need to find the difference between Jairus's earnings and Jenny's earnings:

1. Mark lost 10 pounds every month for 3 months.
2. His final weight is 70 pounds.

Let's denote the initial weight as ""x"" (in pounds). We want to find the value of ""x"". According to the information given, we have:

x - (10 * 3) = 70

The equation above represents the fact that Mark's initial weight (""x"") minus the amount he lost each month (10 pounds per month for 3 months) equals his final weight (70 pounds).

Simplifying the equation:

x - 30 = 70

Now we need to find the value of ""x"" by solving for x. To do this, we'll add 30 to both sides of the equation:

x = 100

The final answer is {Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds}.</s>","Since Mark was losing 10 pounds each month, in 3 months he lost 10 * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 pounds.
Adding the weight lost to the final weight gives an initial weight of 70 + 30 = <<70+30=100>>100 pounds.

                 [/INST] To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we first need to determine the number of toys in James's playset and then calculate how many toys Jonathan needs based on the requirement to have a playset five times larger.

1. James has a playset with 80 toys.
2. Jonathan's playset needs to be five times larger. So, the number of toys in Jonathan's playset is:
   Number of toys in Jonathan's playset = 5 * Number of toys in James's playset
   = 5 * 80
   = 400 toys

3. Since Jonathan currently has fewer toys than needed, the number of toys he has is less than 400. To find the exact number, we can set up an equation and solve it. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as x.

   x < 400

4. We know that he is missing 2 * number of toys needed to make a playset five times larger than James'. So, the number of toys he needs is:
   Number of toys Jonathan needs = Number of toys in his desired playset - Number of toys he currently has

5. We want to find x, so we can set up the following equation:
   Number of toys Jonathan needs = 5 * (Number of toys in James's playset) - x
   We know that Number of toys in James's playset = 80

6. We can now substitute the values and simplify the equation:
   x < 400
   80 * 5 - x < 400
   400 - x < 400
   x > 400
   But this Condition is contradictory since, as per problem statement, x < 400.

7. This means that the given information is not enough to find the exact number of toys Jonathan has. We need more information, such as the number of toys he added or planned to add to his collection, to accurately determine his current toy count.

{The final answer is: Insufficient information to find the exact number of toys Jonathan has.}</s>","Five times as large as James's set of play, which has 80 toys, is 5*80 = <<5*80=400>>400 toys.

Step 3: Calculate the discount amount.
Discount = 10% * $20.50 = $2.05

Step 4: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount to find the final cost Daniel has to pay.

First, let's calculate the base commission for selling $1000 worth of goods:

Base commission rate = 30%
Sales amount = $1000

Commission = Sales amount * Commission rate
Commission = $1000 * 0.3
Commission = $300

Next, let's calculate the additional commission for selling over $1000:

Sales amount over $1000 = $1500
Additional commission rate = 10%

Additional commission = Sales amount over $1000 * Additional commission rate
Additional commission = $1500 * 0.1
Additional commission = $150

Now, let's add the base commission and the additional commission together to find the total commission earned by Antonella:

Total commission = Base commission + Additional commission
Total commission = $300 + $150
Total commission = $450

So, the amount of money Antonella earned for selling goods worth $2500 is:

{The final answer is: $450}</s>","Since Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, she got the first 30% commission, which is 30/100*$1000 = $<<30/100*1000=300>>300
Since goods worth over $1000 earn you a 10% commission, she was entitled to earn an additional 10% commission per $500 on $2500-$1000 = $1500 worth of goods.
This amounts to $1500 * 10% = $<<1500*10*.01=150>>150
In total, Antonella earned $300 from the first commission and $150 from the second commission for a total of $150 + $300 = $<<300+150=450>>450

                 [/INST] Step 1: Analyze the given information.

Given:
- Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold.
- Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long when the water is warm.

Step 2: Find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Since it takes Ray 2 minutes more to swim a mile when the water is warm than when it is cold, we can set up the following equation:

16 minutes (cold) = x minutes (warm) + 2 minutes

We want to find x:

Subtract 2 minutes from both sides:

14 minutes = x minutes

So, it takes Ray 14 minutes to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Step 3: Find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles when the water is cold.

Since Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold, it will take him 4 times as long to swim 3 miles:

1 mile = 16 minutes
3 miles = 3 * 1 mile = 3 * 16 minutes = 48 minutes

So, it takes Ray 48 minutes to swim 3 miles when the water is cold.

Step 4: Find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles when the water is warm.

Since it takes Ray 14 minutes to swim a mile when the water is warm, it will take him 3 times as long to swim 3 miles:

1 mile = 14 minutes
3 miles = 3 * 1 mile = 3 * 14 minutes = 42 minutes

So, it takes Ray 42 minutes to swim 3 miles when the water is warm.

Step 5: Find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles when the water is warm than when it is cold.

The difference between the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles when the water is warm and when it is cold is:

48 minutes (cold) - 42 minutes (warm) = 6 minutes

So, it takes Ray 6 minutes longer to swim 3 miles when the water is warm than when it is cold.

The final answer is: It takes Ray 6 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day.</s>","Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate John's weekly income.
John gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. So his daily income is $2 * 5 = $10.
He works 4 days a week, so his weekly income is $10 * 4 = $40.

Step 2: Determine how many weeks John needs to save $80.
John wants to save $80, so the number of weeks needed is $80 / his weekly savings. Since the question doesn't provide information on how much John saves each week, we cannot directly calculate the number of weeks needed from this information alone.

However, we do know that John's weekly income is $40. To find out how many weeks it takes him to save $80, we can set up the following equation:

$40 * number_of_weeks = $80

Step 3: Solve for the number of weeks.
To find the number of weeks, we can divide both sides of the equation by $40:

number_of_weeks = $80 / $40
number_of_weeks = 2

So, John would need to work for 2 weeks to save up $80.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the foot-long fish sub.
You paid $40 for a foot-long fish sub.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.
Since the cost of the foot-long fish sub is thrice the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we can find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub by dividing the cost of the foot-long sandwich by 3.

Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = Cost of foot-long fish sub / 3
Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = $40 / 3
Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = approximately $13.33 (rounded)

Step 3: Find the total cost of today's lunch.

Step 4: Since each button with 4 holes has 4 holes, the number of holes for these buttons is 7 * 4 = 28.

Step 5: The number of holes for the buttons with 2 holes is 14 * 2 = 28 as well.

Step 6: To find the total number of holes in the bag, we add the number of holes for the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: Total number of holes = 28 (buttons with 2 holes) + 28 (buttons with 4 holes) = 56.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the amount of coffee Octavia drinks daily.
Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount of coffee. The recommended amount is not given directly in the question, but we know that she drinks half of that. Let's assume the daily recommended amount is 6 cups for the sake of easier calculations. Therefore, Octavia drinks 6 cups / 2 = 3 cups of coffee daily.

Step 2: Determine the amount of coffee Juan drinks daily.
Juan drinks 10 times the amount that Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks 3 cups/1 * 10 = 30 cups of coffee daily.

Step 3: Determine how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by.
Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the daily recommended amount from his current intake: 30 cups - 4 cups = 26 cups.

{The final answer is: Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 26 cups.}</s>","Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups
Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which translates to 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups
Subtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan’s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups
Juan must therefore reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups

                 [/INST] To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, let's calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs in each type of cage and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of hamsters:
The number of cages with hamsters is 3, and each cage has 10 hamsters. So, the total number of hamsters is:

Number of hamsters = Number of cages with hamsters * Hamsters per cage
= 3 * 10
= 30

Next, let's find the number of guinea pigs:
The number of cages with guinea pigs is also 3, and each cage has 5 guinea pigs. So, the total number of guinea pigs is:

Number of guinea pigs = Number of cages with guinea pigs * Guinea pigs per cage
= 3 * 5
= 15

Finally, to find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we add the number of hamsters and the number of guinea pigs:

Total number of rodents = Number of hamsters + Number of guinea pigs
= 30 + 15
= 45

{The final answer is: The pet shop had 45 rodents in total.}</s>","There are 3 cages x 10 hamsters/cage = <<3*10=30>>30 hamsters in the pet shop.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so his weight is 2 * 130 = <<2*130=260>>260 pounds.

Step 3: Find the average weight of the three friends.
To find the average weight, add the weights of Mark, Susan, and Bob and divide by the total number of friends: (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = <<(150+130+260)/3=176.67>>176.67 pounds. {The final answer is 176.67 pounds.}</s>","Susan weighs 150 pounds - 20 pounds = <<150-20=130>>130 pounds.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem.
The problem asks for the angle of the sun's position relative to the ground after the sun has moved for 10 hours, given the angle of the pyramids from the horizon and the rate at which the sun moves upwards.

Step 2: Gather information.
1. The pyramids are at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.
2. The sun moves upwards at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.
3. Sahir is standing at the entrance of his house.
4. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves for 10 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the angle of the sun after 10 hours.
First, we need to find the angle of the sun's position at the tip of the pyramid when Sahir observes it. We're given that the pyramids are at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground and that the sun is moving upwards at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Since Sahir observes the sun as it's moving upwards, we'll add the angle of the pyramids to the angle the sun has moved during that time.

Angle of the sun at the tip of the pyramid = Angle of pyramids from the ground + Angle of sun's movement
Angle of pyramids from the ground = 32 degrees
Angle of sun's movement = 5 degrees per hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

So, Angle of the sun at the tip of the pyramid = 32 + 50 = 82 degrees

Step 4: Find the angle between the sun's position and the ground.
Next, we need to find the angle between the sun's position and the ground. Since we know the sun is at an angle of 82 degrees from the ground and we want to find the angle between the sun and the horizontal (ground), we can subtract the angle of the pyramids (32 degrees) from the sun's angle to get the desired angle.

Angle between the sun and the ground = Sun's angle - Angle of pyramids
Angle between the sun and the ground = 82 - 32 = 50 degrees

{The final answer is 50 degrees}</s>","5 degrees an hour for 10 hours 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 degrees

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the age difference between James' two sons.
The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger. So, the age difference is:
12 years (older son) - 4 years (younger son) = 8 years

Step 2: Calculate how many candles each son requires for their birthday cakes.
Since each son gets a cake with 5 candles:
Older son: 5 candles
Younger son: 5 candles

Step 3: Determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy.
Since each pack contains 5 candles:
Candles for the older son: 5 candles
Candles for the younger son: 5 candles
Total candles required: 5 (older son) + 5 (younger son) = 10 candles
Packs of candles required: 10 candles ÷ 5 candles/pack = 2 packs

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many minutes Judy read in the first week. She reads for 15 minutes every night and there are 7 days in a week. So,
Minutes read in the first week = 15 minutes/night * 7 nights/week = 105 minutes/week.

Step 2: Next, we need to find out how many pages Judy reads in 105 minutes. We are given that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. Therefore,
Pages read in 1 hour = 2 pages/(1.5 minutes/page) * 60 minutes/hour = 80 pages/hour.

Step 3: Now, we can calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
Pages read in the first week = 105 minutes/week * 80 pages/hour/week = 8400 pages/year / 52 weeks/year * 7 days/week = 158.5 pages/week * 7 days/week = 1111 pages.
However, since Judy can't read a fraction of a page, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore,
Pages read in the first week = 1110 pages.

Step 4: We know that Judy read a total of 100 pages in the second week. Since we already have the number of pages she read in the first week, we can find the number of pages she read in the second week by subtracting the number of pages she read in the first week from the total number of pages she read in the two weeks:
Pages read in the second week = Total pages read - Pages read in the first week = 1110 pages - 1110 pages = 0 pages.

This result doesn't make sense, as Judy should have read some pages in the second week according to the problem statement. There seems to be a mistake or missing information in the problem.

Therefore, the answer could not be determined with the given information.</s>","Every night, Judy reads 15 minutes/1.5 minutes = <<15/1.5=10>>10 sets of 2 pages.

In the first week, she reads a total of 20 x 7 = <<20*7=140>>140 pages.

                 [/INST] To find the age of Shiloh's nephew, let's first find Shiloh's age in 7 years.

Step 1: In 7 years, Shiloh will be 3 times as old as his nephew. Today, Shiloh is 44 years old, so we can set up the equation:

Shiloh's age (7 years from now) = 3 * Nephew's age

Step 2: We're given that Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = <<44+7=51>>51 years old in 7 years, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

51 = 3 * Nephew's age

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate Nephew's age:

Nephew's age = 51 / 3

Step 4: Since division by 3 doesn't yield a whole number, we'll need to assume that Nephew turned a certain age very recently before Shiloh turned 7 years older. To accommodate for this, we'll try rounding Nephew's age down from an estimate and then check if it's possible for Shiloh to be 3 times Nephew's age in 7 years with that age:

Let's try a Nephew age of 15:

15 * 3 = 45

If Nephew's age were 15, then Shiloh would be 45 (Nephew's age × 3) at that time. However, Shiloh's age 7 years from now is given as 51, which means that 15 is insufficient as a Nephew's age.

Therefore, we need to try the next possibility:

Step 5: Let's try a Nephew age of 16:

16 * 3 = 48

If Nephew's age were 16, then Shiloh would be 48 (Nephew's age × 3) at that time. Adding 7 years to Shiloh's age gives us 55, which is greater than the 51 years mentioned earlier. However, since we're dealing with approximations, we can't completely rule out this possibility since Shiloh's age may have rounded up.

Because no definitive answer can be given based on the given information, we can only conclude that Nephew's age falls between 16 and 17 and that Shiloh will be three times older in 7 years. The final answer is: Nephew's age is approximately 16 or 17 years old.</s>","In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = <<44+7=51>>51 years old.

                    Three teenagers are playing soccer . on the weekend. Richie, the . first teenager, ? scored . 20 more goals than ? Mark and scored 45 , more goals ? than Anna. If : Richie . scored ! 80 goals, how ? many goals did all three teenagers score?
                 [/INST] Let's call the number of goals scored by Mark ""m"" and the number of goals scored by Anna ""a"". According to the problem, we know the following:

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so Richie's score is m + 20.
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so Richie's score is a + 45.
3. Richie scored a total of 80 goals.

Now we have three equations based on the information given:

m + 20 = Richie's score
a + 45 = Richie's score
m + a = 80

Since Richie's score is the same in both equations, we can set them equal to each other:

m + 20 = a + 45

Now, we can solve for 'm' by subtracting 'a' from both sides and then subtracting 20 from the result:

m = a + 25

So, Mark scored a goal count 'a' and Richie scored a goal count 'm' which is 'a + 25'. Hence, Anna's score is 'a'.

We also know that the total goals scored by all three teenagers is 80, so:

m + a + Richie's score = 80
m + a + (m + 20) = 80
2m + a + 20 = 80

Solving for 'a' by subtracting 2m and 20 from both sides:

a = 60 - 2m

Substituting the expression for 'm' that we found earlier:

a = 60 - 2(a + 25)
a = 60 - 2a - 50
a = -a + 10
a = 10

So, Anna scored 10 goals. To find out how many goals Mark scored, we can use the expression we found for 'm':

m = a + 25 = 10 + 25 = 35

Therefore, Mark scored 35 goals.

So, the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers is:

Mark's goals = 35
Anna's goals = 10
Richie's goals = 80

Total goals = 35 + 10 + 80 = 125

{The final answer is 125 goals}</s>","If Richie scored 80 goals, which is 20 more goals than Mark, Mark scored 80-20 = <<80-20=60>>60 goals.

Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna, which means Anna scored 80-45 = <<80-45=35>>35 goals.
All three teenagers scored 140+35 = <<140+35=175>>175 goals.

1. Liam sold lemonades worth $63. Let's find out how many lemonades he sold:
   Liam's earnings = $63
   Price per lemonade = $4
   Since we don't know the number of lemonades Liam sold, let's denote it as 'x'. We can set up the equation: x * $4 = $63

However, we can work with the given information and make an assumption that Liam probably sold 15 or 16 lemonades that weekend.

3. Now, we'll find out how many lemonades Mitchell sold and how much he earned, assuming he sold fewer lemonades than Liam:

   Mitchell's number of lemonades sold = 21
   Price per lemonade = $4
   His earnings = number of lemonades * price per lemonade
                   = 21 * $4
                   = $84

4. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made selling lemonades than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

   Difference in earnings = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings
                                 = $84 - ($63 or 15x * $4 if we consider the possibility of Liam selling 15 or 16 lemonades)

   Since we don't have a definitive number of lemonades Liam sold, we can't calculate the exact difference in earnings. However, even with our assumption that Liam sold 15 lemonades, Mitchell still made more money that weekend.

   The final answer depends on the actual number of lemonades Liam sold, but even if we consider the given information, it appears that Mitchell sold more lemonades and made more money that weekend.</s>","Mitchell made 21 * 4 = $<<21*4=84>>84 selling lemonade.
Thus, Mitchell made 84 - 63 = $<<84-63=21>>21 more selling lemonade that weekend than Liam.

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. Peter spends $5 per day on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since there are four weekdays in a week, he spends $5 * 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20 on wooden action figures.
2. Peter spends the remaining days of the week, that is, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, on plastic action figures. He spends $2 per day on plastic action figures, so he spends $2 * 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6 on plastic action figures.
3. Peter's total spending on wooden and plastic action figures is $20 (wooden) + $6 (plastic) = $<<20+6=26>>26.
4. The total number of action figures Peter buys is the total amount spent divided by the cost per action figure.
5. For wooden action figures, the cost is $5 per figure, so the number of wooden action figures is $20 / $5 = <<20/5=4>>4.
6. For plastic action figures, the cost is $2 per figure, so the number of plastic action figures is $6 / $2 = <<6/2=3>>3.
7. The total number of action figures Peter buys is the number of wooden action figures + the number of plastic action figures = 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7.

The final answer is {Peter will have bought a total of 7 action figures by the end of the week}.</s>","There are 7 days in a week so if he wishes to spend an equal amount of $70 each day that would be $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10

Ford grows 40 roses every week.

Step 2: Calculate how many roses are ordered by each flower shop every week.
Flower shop 1 orders 20 roses.
Flower shop 2 orders 15 roses.
Flower shop 3 orders 30 roses.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to all the flower shops every week.
Total weekly supply = Weekly supply to flower shop 1 + Weekly supply to flower shop 2 + Weekly supply to flower shop 3
Total weekly supply = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 4: Find out how many roses are ordered by all the flower shops every week.
Total weekly orders = Orders from flower shop 1 + Orders from flower shop 2 + Orders from flower shop 3
Total weekly orders = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 5: Since Ford's weekly supply equals the total weekly orders, Ford does not lack any roses to supply to the flower shops every week.

Step 6: To find out if Ford lacks roses to supply to the flower shops every month, we need to know the monthly orders from each flower shop. However, the problem statement does not provide that information, so it is not possible to determine the answer to that question with the information available.

Therefore, the final answer is: It is not possible to determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply to all the flower shops every month with the given information.</s>","The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.

So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
The total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160

                 [/INST] To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's savings account after 2 years, given that she withdraws $100 every month, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Calculate the monthly withdrawals for 2 years.
2. Subtract the total withdrawals from the initial savings.

Let's calculate the monthly withdrawals for 2 years:

12 months in a year -> 2 years has 24 months
Monthly withdrawal = $100
Total withdrawals = Monthly withdrawal × Number of months
Total withdrawals = $100 × 24
Total withdrawals = $2,400

Now subtract the total withdrawals from the initial savings:

Initial savings = $3,000
Total withdrawals = $2,400
Remaining balance = Initial savings - Total withdrawals
Remaining balance = $3,000 - $2,400
Remaining balance = $600

Therefore, {The final answer is $600}. Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account after 2 years.</s>","A year has 12 months, and since she withdraws money from the account every month, after 2 years, she will have withdrawn money for 2*12= <<24=24>>24 months.

Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, and a loaf costs $3.00. Therefore, the cost of making one sandwich with bread is:
$3.00/loaf * 1/10 sandwiches/loaf = $0.30/sandwich

Step 2: Find the cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich.
They spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for making 10 sandwiches. So, the cost per sandwich is:
$30.00/10 sandwiches = $3.00/sandwich

Step 3: Find the selling price of each sandwich.
They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 in total. So, the selling price of one sandwich is:
$7.00/sandwich

Step 4: Calculate the profit per sandwich.
Profit per sandwich = Selling price - Cost of making the sandwich
Profit per sandwich = $7.00 - ($0.30 + $3.00) = $7.00 - $3.30 = $3.70

- Divide: x + (x/2) / 5
- Multiply: ([(x + x/2) / 5] * (x - 12))

Step 2: Calculate x + x/2
Adding x and x/2:
x + x/2 = 2x / 2 = x + x/2 = x(1 + 1/2)

Step 3: Substitute x(1 + 1/2) into the division
x(1 + 1/2) / 5 = x(1.5) / 5 = 3x/5

Step 4: Square the result of step 3 for the multiplication
(3x/5) ^ 2 = 9x^2 / 25

Step 5: Subtract 12 from x
x - 12 = (x - 12)

Step 6: Multiply the results of steps 4 and 5
(9x^2 / 25) * (x - 12) = 9x^2(x-12) / 25

Step 7: Expand the polynomial
9x^2(x-12) / 25 = 9x^3 - 9x^2(12) / 25

Step 8: Simplify by factoring out x^2
9x^3 - 108x^2 / 25 = x^2(9x - 108) / 25

Step 9: Find the final value of the number train
We do not have a specific value for x, so there is no definitive final answer.

                    Maggie's oven ! is . malfunctioning. When she sets it ; to 450 the actual . temperature : is 468. If it's off . by the same ; percentage ; for any recipe, what temperature should she ; set it at if her recipe ! calls . for 520 degrees?
                 [/INST] To find out what temperature Maggie should set her oven to cook a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we first need to find out how much her oven is overheating by, as a percentage.

Step 1: Find the percentage difference between the desired temperature and the actual temperature.
The difference between the desired temperature (450) and the actual temperature (468) is: 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

To find the percentage difference, we can use the following formula:

Percentage Difference = ((Actual Temperature - Desired Temperature) / Desired Temperature) * 100%

Plugging in the values:

Percentage Difference = ((468 - 450) / 450) * 100%
Percentage Difference = (18 / 450) * 100%

To simplify the calculation:

Percentage Difference = 18/100 * 100%
Percentage Difference = 18%

Step 2: Determine the temperature difference in degrees for the recipe that calls for 520 degrees.
We know that the oven is 18% too hot when set to the desired temperature of 450. So, to find the correct temperature when the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to add 18% to 520.

Let's calculate the answer:

Additional Temperature = Desired Temperature * Percentage Difference
Additional Temperature = 520 * 0.18
Additional Temperature = 94.4

Step 3: Find the adjusted temperature Maggie should set her oven to.
Adjusted Temperature = Desired Temperature + Additional Temperature
Adjusted Temperature = 520 + 94.4
Adjusted Temperature = 614.4

Since an oven doesn't measure temperature down to the tenths place, we can round up to the nearest 50 degrees to get an optimal and practical temperature setting.

{The final answer is: Maggie should set her oven to 620 degrees to cook a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.}</s>","The oven off by 18 degrees because 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18
The oven is off by 4% because 18 / 450 x 100 = <<18/450*100=4>>4%
Therefore X + .04X = 520
Therefore 1.04X = 520
The temperature to set it is 500 because 520 / 1.04 = <<520/1.04=500>>500

                 [/INST] To find out how many minutes it takes Max to watch the two movies, we need to calculate the length of each movie in minutes and then add them together.

Step 1: Convert the hours and minutes of the first movie into minutes.
We know that:
1 hour = 60 minutes
So, the first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, which can also be written as 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1 hour + 30 * 60 minutes = 1 hour + 1800 minutes.

Step 2: Convert the hours and minutes of the second movie into minutes.
The second movie is 1 hour and 5 minutes long, which can also be written as 1 hour + 5 minutes = 1 hour + 5 * 60 minutes = 1 hour + 300 minutes.

Step 3: Add the lengths of both movies to find the total length.
Total length = Length of first movie + Length of second movie
Total length = 1800 minutes + 300 minutes
Total length = 2100 minutes

{The final answer is: It will take Max 2100 minutes to watch the two movies.}</s>","One hour has 60 minutes.
The first movie is 60 + 30 = <<60+30=90>>90 minutes long.
Two hours is equal to 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
The second movie is 120 + 5 = <<120+5=125>>125 minutes long.
Max will take 90 + 125 = <<90+125=215>>215 minutes to watch the two movies.

Juan wants to know the value of his house and Herb's house combined. Juan knows that Herb's house is worth $76,000. Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's.

Step 2: Find the value of Juan's house
Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we can determine the value of Juan's house by finding 70% of Herb's house value.

70% of $76,000 = ($76,000 * 0.7) = $53,200

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

Step 3: Find the total value of both houses
To find the total value of both houses, we simply add the values of Juan's and Herb's houses.

$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

1. Judy bought a dozen cups, so she bought 12 cups.
2. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 12 × 2 = 24 dishes.
3. At the event, she found out that her friend brought 40 cups.
4. Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.
5. To find the total number of utensils brought by the two, we add the number of cups and dishes Judy brought and the number of dishes her friend brought: 12 + 24 + 44 = 70

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of one box of contacts at the current discount.
The cost of one box of contacts is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the cost of each box is reduced by 10%. Thus, the cost of one box with the discount is:

$100.00 - ($100.00 * 10%) = $100.00 - $10 = $90.00

Step 2: Calculate the number of boxes Pete needs to purchase to have 90 contacts.
Since there are 90 contacts in one box, Pete needs to buy one box to have enough contacts.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of purchasing two boxes.
As we know, one box costs $90.00. So, the cost of two boxes is:

$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Step 4: Determine the cost of one pair of contacts.
Since there are 90 contacts in one box, and Pete is buying two boxes to have enough contacts for two pairs, the cost of one pair of contacts is:

$180.00 / 2 = $90.00

- Jill worked for 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. So, her total working hours are 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 3 = 6 hours on Saturday. He also worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. So, his total working hours are 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

Step 2: Find the earnings for each person.
- The rate is $10 per hour for both John and Jill.
- So, Jill earned $10 * 3 = $30 for her 3 hours of work.
- John earned $10 * 6 = $60 for his 6 hours of work and $10 * 3 = $30 for his 3 hours of work. However, these earnings are for separate days, so John's total earnings for the week are $60 + $30 = $90.

- During aerobics, she burns 500 calories/hour, and spends 2 hours on it: 2 hours × 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.
- During running, she burns 600 calories/hour, and spends 1 hour on it: 1 hour × 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Step 2: Find the total number of calories Hannah burns.
Total calories burned = Calories burned during aerobics + Calories burned during running
Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Step 3: Calculate the amount of water Hannah needs to drink based on the number of calories she burned.
- She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns: 1600 calories / (200 calories/500 ml) = 8 liters (L)

Let's denote the number of red jelly beans as R, the number of blue jelly beans as B, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

According to the problem statement, the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans. In other words, R = 0.9B. Also, it contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so G = B + 1.01B = 1.01B.

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can equate the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans as follows:

R + B + G = 4500

Now, let's find out the relationship between red, blue, and green jelly beans. Substituting R = 0.9B and G = 1.01B into the equation, we have:

0.9B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Solving for B:

B = \frac{4500}{(1+0.9+1.01)} ≈ 3211.11

Since there cannot be a fraction of a jelly bean, the number of blue jelly beans must be approximately 3211.

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R ≈ 0.9 × 3211 ≈ 2890
G ≈ 1.01×3211 ≈ 3274

To find the difference between green and red jelly beans:

1. Alex invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people says they will bring 2 friends, so Alex will have an additional 200 guests (100 x 2).
3. Alex calls and invites 10 friends.
4. Of these 10 friends, 8 of them say they will be bring their spouses, which adds an additional 8 guests (8 x 1).

Therefore, the total number of guests Alex will have is: 100 (original guests) + 200 (additional guests from those invited by the original guests) + 8 (guests from her directly invited friends) = 308 guests.

{The final answer is: Alex will need seats for 308 people}</s>","Each of the people that were emailed are bringing 2 friends, which means that they will be in groups of 1 +2 = <<1+2=3>>3 people.
Since 100 people were emailed, this creates a total of 3 * 100 = <<3*100=300>>300 people.
Out of her friends, 8 people said that they will be bringing their spouse, so this is a total of 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 people.
Including her own seat, Alex is going to need a total of 300 + 18 +1 = <<300+18+1=319>>319 seats.

Shipping cost: $4
Total cost: $16 + $4 = $20

On eBay:
Boots cost: $13
Shipping cost: $4 (twice as much as Amazon)
Total cost: $13 + $4 = $17 (since we've already accounted for the increased shipping cost in our calculation)

Now, let's find the difference in total cost between the two websites:

$20 (Amazon) - $17 (eBay) = $3

                 [/INST] Step 1: The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day.

Step 2: To find out how many days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window (which is 20 feet off the ground), we need to calculate when the beanstalk reaches a height of 24 feet (4 feet initial height + 20 feet window height).

Step 3: Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, we can use the formula for exponential growth: final height = initial height * (2 ^ number of days).

Step 4: We want to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to reach a height of 24 feet.

Step 5: Rearranging the formula to solve for the number of days, we get: number of days = log2(final height / initial height).

Step 6: Plugging in the values, we have: number of days = log2[(24 feet) / (4 feet)].

Step 7: Calculating the logarithm: number of days = log2[6], since the final height (24 feet) is 6 times the initial height (4 feet).

Step 8: Solving for the number of days using a calculator, we find that it takes approximately 3 bits or 4 days (since the calculation results in 3 with rounding, we need to add an additional day for the beanstalk to reach a height of 24 feet).

{The final answer is: it takes 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window}.</s>","To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet
To find its height after two days, multiply the height after one day by 2: 8 feet * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 feet
To find its height after three days, multiply the height after two days by 2: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. This is taller than the window, so it took three days for the beanstalk to pass the window.

Protein in 100 grams of mushrooms = 3 grams
Protein in 200 grams of mushrooms = 200 grams * 3 grams/100 grams = 6 grams

Step 2: Find the amount of protein John gets per week.
Days in a week = 7
Protein in 1 week = Protein per day * Days per week
Protein in 1 week = 6 grams * 7 days = 42 grams

Step 2: We are told that Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can set up the equation: x = 2(x/2) + 5
Step 3: Simplifying the equation: x = 1.5x + 5
Step 4: Solving for x: 0.5x = 5, x = 10
So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.
Step 5: To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we simply add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total cost of the dental work for two implants and one crown.
- Each implant has a base price of $2000. So the cost for two implants is $2000 * 2 = $4000.
- For one implant, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So the total cost for one implant and a crown is $2000 + $500 = $2500.
- Therefore, the total cost for two implants and two crowns is $4000 * 2 + $2500 * 2 = $11,000.

Step 2: Determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work.
- George makes $15 per hour at work. So he needs to work for a number of hours equal to the total cost divided by his hourly wage.
- $11,000 total cost / $15 per hour = 733.33 hours
- However, since George can't work a fraction of an hour, he'll need to work at least 734 hours to have enough money for the dental work.

{The final answer is: George needs to work at least 734 hours to pay for the dental work.}</s>","The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the measure of the smallest angle as x.

According to the problem, the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees:

x + x + AngleC = 180
2x + AngleC = 180
AngleC = 180 - 2x

Now, we know that one angle is twice the smallest angle, and another angle is three times the smallest angle. So, the measures of these angles are:

AngleA = 2x
AngleB = 3x

From the Sum of Angles in a Triangle formula, we have:

AngleA + AngleB + AngleC = 180
2x + 3x + AngleC = 180
5x + AngleC = 180

Since we already found the expression for AngleC, we can substitute it back into this equation:

5x + (180 - 2x) = 180
5x + 180 - 2x = 180
3x + 180 = 180

Solving for x, we get:

3x = 0
x = 0

This result represents an invalid solution as there cannot be a triangle with angles of measure zero.

Let's try finding the solution numerically instead.

We know that a triangle with angles measuring x°, x°, and (180 - 2x - 3x)° exists since the sum of the angles add up to 180 degrees.

Let's assume the smallest angle to be x = 10°, then the other two angles have the following measures:

AngleA = 2x = 2 x 10 = 20°
AngleB = 3x = 3 x 10 = 30°
AngleC = 180 - 2x - 3x = 180 - 2 * 10 - 3 * 10 = 130°

This is a valid solution. We can see that the sum of AngleA and AngleB is 50° (20° + 30° = 50°), and AngleC is indeed equal to 130°. Hence, the triangle with one angle twice the smallest (20 degrees), and another angle three times the smallest (30 degrees) does exist, and the largest angle (AngelC) is indeed 130 degrees.

{The final answer is 130 degrees}</s>","Let x be the measure of the smallest angle
x+2x+3x=180
6x=180
x=<<30=30>>30
Then the largest angle is 3*30=<<3*30=90>>90 degrees.

2. We have 6 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 nickels, so 6 dimes is worth 60 nickels.
3. We have 14 nickels already.
4. We have 15 pennies, and each penny is worth 1 nickel, so 15 pennies is worth 15 nickels.

Combining all the nickels Colby has, we get a total of: 40 (from quarters) + 60 (from dimes) + 14 (from previous nickels) + 15 (from pennies) = 119 nickels

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the plane's speed.
The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. To find the speed, divide the distance traveled by the time taken:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour (mph)

Step 2: Determine how long it takes to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed.
Use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 2000 miles / 400 mph
Time = 5 hours

{The final answer is: It takes 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.}</s>","The rate is 1200/3=<<1200/3=400>>400 mph.
Then it would take 2000/400=<<2000/400=5>>5 hours more.

1. Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.
2. Marissa makes 3/4 of what Ruiz makes in 1 hour.

Step 2: Find out how much chocolates Marissa makes in 2 hours:
Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we'll find out how much Marissa makes in the same amount of time.
1. Marissa makes 3/4 of what Ruiz makes in an hour.
2. So, Marissa makes 3/4 * 120 = 96 pounds of chocolates in an hour.
3. Now, to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in 2 hours, we simply double this rate.
   Therefore, Marissa makes 96 * 2 = 192 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.

Step 3: Find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in 12 hours:
We know that Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours and Marissa makes 192 pounds in 2 hours.
1. Together, they make 120 + 192 = 312 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.

Patrick sold 15 cups per hour for 4 hours, so he sold a total of 15 * 4 = <<15*4=60>>60 cups in the first 4 hours.
The price he charged per cup was $0.50, so the revenue he earned from selling lemonade in the first 4 hours was 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $<<60*0.5=30>>30.

Step 2: Calculate the number of cups sold in the next 2 hours and the price per hour.

                 [/INST] To determine how many years before the tires need to be replaced, we first need to calculate how many rotations Jeremy's car tires make in a month, and then how many months or years that corresponds to until they reach 10,440,000 rotations.

1. Calculate the number of rotations per month:
We know that the car drives 400 miles a month, and every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times. So, the number of rotations per mile is 725. The total number of rotations per month is:

Rotations per month = (Miles driven per month) * (Rotations per mile)
= 400 miles * 725 rotations per mile
= 290,000 rotations per month

2. Convert rotations per month to rotations per year:
We want to find out how long it takes to reach 10,440,000 rotations. Since we have the number of rotations per month, we can calculate how many years it takes to reach that number:

Rotations per year = Rotations per month * 12 months
= 290,000 rotations/month * 12 months
= 3,480,000 rotations/year

3. Determine how many years until the tires need to be replaced:
We know that the tires can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before they need to be replaced. We can find how many years that corresponds to by dividing the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:

Years until replacement = Total rotations / Rotations per year
= 10,440,000 rotations / 3,480,000 rotations/year
≈ 3.0056 years

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round up to the next whole number to be safe:

{The final answer is approximately 3 years and 1 month (or 3.5 years) before the tires need to be replaced.}</s>","Jeremy drives 400/2=<<400/2=200>>200 segments of 2 miles
That means each month the car undergoes 200*725=<<200*725=145000>>145,000 rotations
So the tire can last for 10,440,000/145,000=<<10440000/145000=72>>72 months
That means the tires will last 72/12=<<72/12=6>>6 years

                 [/INST] To find out how much each pump costs in cents, follow these steps:

1. First, we need to determine how many washes one full bottle of shampoo provides. Since one bottle gives 120 washings and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the number of washes with one pump is also 120.
2. Therefore, each pump gives the number of washings equal to the total number of washings from one bottle divided by the number of pumps used per wash. Mathematically, this is represented as: Number of washings per pump = Total number of washings / Number of pumps per wash
3. Substituting the given values, we get: Number of washings per pump = 120 / 1
4. Simplifying the equation, we have Number of washings per pump = 120
5. Now, let's find out how much one pump costs. The total cost of the bottle is $24, and since one bottle provides 120 washings, the cost per wash is $0.20 (=$24 /120)
6. However, since Jackie uses one pump per wash, the cost per pump equals the cost per wash: Cost per pump = Cost per wash = $0.20
7. To find the cost of one pump in cents, we multiply the cost per pump by 100: Cost per pump (cents) = Cost per pump * 100 = $0.20 * 100 = 20 cents

{The final answer is: Each pump costs 20 cents}</s>","2 pumps will give you 120 washes so if she only uses 1 pump per wash she doubles the number of washes so she now has 120*2 = <<120*2=240>>240 washes

The original price of the shirt is $25. With a 30% discount, the new price is:
$25 * (1 - 0.3) = $17.50 {The price of the shirt after discount is $17.50}

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the shorts after discount.
The original price of the shorts is $35. With a 30% discount, the new price is:
$35 * (1 - 0.3) = $24.45 {The price of the shorts after discount is $24.45}

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the items after discount, but before tax.
Total cost = $17.50 (shirt) + $24.45 (shorts) = $42.05 {The total cost of the items after the discount is $42.05}

Step 4: Calculate the amount of sales tax based on the total cost.
Assuming a sales tax rate of X%, the amount of sales tax would be:
$42.05 * X/100 {The sales tax amount is not given in the problem, so we cannot find the exact sales tax amount}

Step 5: Calculate the final cost of the items, including sales tax.
Final cost = $42.05 (cost after discount) + (sales tax amount) {The final cost of the items, including sales tax, cannot be found without knowing the sales tax rate}

Step 6: Calculate the amount of money left after the purchase.
Money left = $50 (initial amount) - $42.05 (final cost) = $7.95 {The amount of money left after the purchase is $7.95}

{The final answer is: Joe will have $7.95 left after the purchase}</s>","The price of the two clothing items totals 35 + 25 = <<35+25=60>>60 dollars before discount.

The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size: {8 ounces}
The second player also consumed some additional beef: {We don't have enough information to determine the exact amount}
The third player ate a one-pound steak: {16 ounces}

Since the vegetarian meals don't contain meat, we only need to consider the meat consumed by the first three players.

Step 2: Add up the ounces of meat consumed by the first three players.

Meat from the first player: {6 ounces}
Meat from the second player (beef tips): {8 ounces}
Meat from the second player (added beef): {We don't know}
Meat from the third player: {16 ounces}

Step 3: To find the total amount of meat consumed by the team (excluding the vegetarian meals), we need to determine the amount of meat eaten by the second player (beef tips and unknown additional beef).

Since the first player ate a 6-ounce steak and the third player ate a one-pound steak, it's likely that the second player's unknown additional beef was also substantial.

                 [/INST] To find the total number of posts for the Reddit group in March, we first need to calculate the number of posts per day and then multiply it by the number of days in March. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, so the total number of posts per day for the group is:
   Total posts per day = Members * Posts per member per day
   Total posts per day = 1000 * 3
   Total posts per day = 3000 posts

2. There are 31 days in March in most years, so the total number of posts for March is:
   Total posts in March = Total posts per day * Days in March
   Total posts in March = 3000 * 31
   Total posts in March = 93,000 posts

Therefore, {The final answer is 93,000 posts for the Reddit group in March}.</s>","The total number of posts from all members in a day is 1000 members * 3 posts/member = <<1000*3=3000>>3000 posts.
March has 31 days, so the total number of posts will be 31 days * 3000 posts/day = <<31*3000=93000>>93000 posts

Gary does laundry twice a week, so:
Number of loads per week = 2

Step 2: Determine how many gallons of water are used in a week.
Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so:
Gallons of water used per week = 2 (loads/week) * 20 (gallons/load) = 40 gallons/week

Step 3: Determine how many gallons of water are used in a year.
There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
Gallons of water used per year = 40 (gallons/week) * 52 (weeks/year) = 2080 gallons/year

Step 4: Determine how much money Gary spends on water for laundry in a year.
A gallon of water costs $0.15, so:
Cost of water per gallon = $0.15
Cost of water for an entire load = 20 gallons/load * $0.15/gallon = $3
Cost of water for laundry in a year = 2080 gallons/year * $3/gallon = $6240

The final answer is: Gary spends $6240 on water for laundry in a year.</s>","First multiply the number of times Gary does laundry per week by the number of weeks per year to find how many times he does it in a year: 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = <<2*52=104>>104 loads/year

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate how much meat Prince sells in a day.
Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works for 10 hours a day.
Meat sold in 1 day = Meat sold per hour * Hours worked per day
Meat sold in 1 day = 15kg/hour * 10 hours
{Meat sold in 1 day = 150kg}

Step 2: Determine how long it takes Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull.
The meat from Bill's bull weighs 750kg. We need to find out how many days it takes Prince to sell this amount of meat.
Amount of meat sold to cover Bill's bull = Weight of Bill's bull (750kg)
Number of days required = Amount of meat to sell / Meat sold per day
Number of days required = 750kg / 150kg/day

{The final answer is: Approximately 5 days}

1. The school auditorium has 4 rows, and there are 18 seats in each row. So, there are a total of 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats in the auditorium.
2. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. That's 72 seats * (1/4) = 18 seats.
3. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. To find out how many seats this is, we need to subtract the number of seats taken by the administrators from the total number of seats and then find one-third of that number. That's (72 seats - 18 seats for administrators) * (1/3) = 26.67 seats, but since there can't be a fraction of a seat, we'll assume that 2 parents shared the extra 0.67 seat, so there were 26 parents in total.
4. Therefore, the number of seats left for students is the total number of seats minus the number of seats taken by the administrators and parents: 72 seats - 18 seats for administrators - 26 seats for parents = 32 seats.

{The final answer is 32 students.}</s>","There are 4 x 18 = <<4*18=72>>72 seats in the school auditorium.

                 [/INST] First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school. He chews 1 piece every 2 hours, and school lasts for 8 hours. We'll need to find out how many 2-hour intervals fit into an 8-hour school day.

2 hours * Number of intervals = 8 hours
Number of intervals = 8 hours / 2 hours = 4

So Jim chews 4 pieces of gum at school.

Next, we'll calculate the number of pieces Jim chews during the day outside of school. He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 1 + 1 = 2 pieces.

Now, Jim gives half of the remaining pieces to his sister. If we let the number of pieces Jim starts with be X, then he gives away X/2 pieces. We know he has X - X/2 = X/2 pieces left at the end of the day.

Finally, Jim initially has a pack of 20 pieces of gum. If he uses X/2 pieces during the day, then he has 20 - X/2 pieces left over:

20 - X/2 = X/2
X = 20 * 2 = 40

Therefore, Jim starts with 40 pieces of gum, and uses 4 pieces at school, 2 pieces on the way home and after dinner, and half his remaining gum for his sister, leaving him with:

X - (4 + 2 + X/2) = 40 - (4 + 2 + 40/2) = 40 - (6 + 20) = 38 pieces of gum at the end of the day.

{The final answer is 38 pieces of gum.}</s>","Jim goes to school for 8 hours, so if he chews 1 stick of gum every 2 hours that means he chews 8/2= <<8/2=4>>4 sticks of gum
Jim chews 1 stick on the way home, plus 2 sticks after dinner for a total of 1+1=2 sticks of gum
His sister asks for half his remaining gum. Jim started with 20 and has chewed 6, so he has 20-6=<<20-6=14>>14 sticks left
This means Jim gives her 14/2=<<14/2=7>>7 sticks of gum
Jim had 20 sticks of gum to begin with, and gave away 4+2+7=13 sticks away

1. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So the number of cars towed on the first three days is 10 * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 cars.

2. For the remaining days of the week, the tow truck pulled 10 cars less for each day, so the number of cars towed on each of these days is 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6 cars.
3. To find out how many cars were towed on these remaining days, we need to know how many days there are in a week after the first three days. We know there are 7 days in a week, so - 3 = 4. So the number of cars towed on these remaining days is 6 * 4 = <<6*4=24>>24 cars.

Therefore, the total number of cars towed during the week is 30 cars (on the first three days) + 24 cars (on the remaining days) = <<30+24=54>>54 cars.

Adam's height: 40 inches = 3.33 feet (1 inch = 0.0833 feet)
Roller coaster height requirement: 4 feet

Step 2: Determine how long it will take for Adam to grow to the required height.
Since Adam grows 2 inches (or 0.5 feet) a year:
Years until Adam is tall enough = (Required height - Current height) / Annual growth

Step 3: Calculate the number of years.
Years = (4 feet - 3.33 feet) / 0.5 feet/year
Years = 0.66 feet / 0.5 feet/year

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find out how many riders can stay upright on a wave that is over 30 feet. We know that 25% of the riders can do this.

Let's denote the total number of riders as x. Then, the number of riders who can stay upright is 0.25x.

Step 2: Next, we need to find out how many women can stay upright. We know that 60% of the riders are women.

The number of women is 0.6x. The number of women who can stay upright is 0.25 * 0.6x = 0.15x.

Step 3: We are given that there are 100 riders in total. Therefore, x = 100.

Step 4: The number of women who can stay upright is 0.15 * 100 = 15 women.

Step 5: To find out how many men can stay upright, we can subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

The number of men who can stay upright is 0.25x - 15 = 24.75 + 15 = 39.75. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Step 2: We are also given that the cost of the silver jewel is $400 less than the cost of the gold jewel. So, S = G - $400.

Step 3: We are given that the price of the diamond jewel is $2000. Substituting D = $2000 into our original equation for G in terms of D, we get G = 4/5 * $2000 = $4000.

Step 4: Finally, to find the total price for all three jewels, we can add together the prices of the gold, diamond, and silver jewels. So, Total price = G + D + S = $4000 + $2000 + (G - $400) = $10000 + G - $400.

Since we already found that G = $4000, we can substitute this back into our equation for the total price: Total price = $10000 + $4000 - $400 = $14000.

                 [/INST] Let's call the number of truck stamps ""x."" According to the problem, Max bought 16 snowflake stamps and 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so:

16 (snowflake stamps) < 16 + x (truck stamps)
x > 16

We also know that there are 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps:

x (truck stamps) > x + 9 (rose stamps)
x > x + 9
x > 9

Now we have two inequalities: x > 16 and x > 9. To find the smallest possible value for x that satisfies both inequalities, we can think of x as a variable with a lower bound equal to the maximum of the two given values:

x > max(16, 9)
x > 16

Therefore, x, the number of truck stamps, must be greater than 16. Since we found that x > 16, and we know that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps, we can calculate the number of truck stamps as follows:

x = 16 + 3
x = 19

Now that we have the number of truck stamps, we can calculate the number of rose stamps:

x (truck stamps) > x + 9 (rose stamps)
19 > 19 + 9
19 > 28

Given that x = 19, and we know x > 28 (which is obviously incorrect based on our previous calculation), we see that there's a mistake in the problem statement regarding the relation between the number of rose stamps and truck stamps. Since this information is incorrect, the problem cannot be solved as presented.

                 [/INST] To solve this problem, we first need to find out how long it takes for the difference between their distances to be closed by Tom's faster driving speed.

Let x be the time (in hours) it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob.

The distance Bob travels in x hours is 75 mph * x hours = 75x miles.

The distance Tom travels in x hours is 70 mph * x hours = 70x miles.

Since the difference between their distances is 5 miles (75x - 70x = 5x), we can set up the equation:

5x = 5 ( miles)

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

x = 1 hour

So, it takes Tom 1 hour less to catch up with Bob:

x = 1 hour (Tom)
70 mph * (1 + 1) hours = 140 miles

Bob travels 75 miles in 1 hour, which means:

75 miles = 75 miles/hour * 1 hour

Now, we need to find out how long it took for Tom to cover that distance:

Tom travels 140 miles in t hours:

140 miles = 70 miles/hour * t hours

Solving for t:

t = 2 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 2 hours to catch up with Bob.

{The final answer is: It takes Tom 2 hours to catch up with Bob}</s>","Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour to Bob's 55 miles per hour, meaning Tom is gaining at a rate of 70 mph - 55 mph = <<70-55=15>>15 mph.

Cost per class = Total cost / Number of classes
Cost per class = $60 / 10
Cost per class = $6

Since his parents have set a limit of $10 per class, Manny can attend up to $6 worth of classes for each class he actually attends. Therefore, the number of classes he can miss is the number of classes where he only incurs the $4 in additional cost that is below his parents' limit.

Let x be the number of classes Manny misses and y be the number of classes he attends. Then:

Total cost = 6x + y * cost per class
$60 = 6x + 10y

Subtracting 6x from both sides:

10y = $54
y = 54/10
y = 5.4

                 [/INST] To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers Julie processes in the same amount of time as Jewel processing 50 customers.

Let's assume that it takes Jewel x minutes to process 50 customers. Therefore, it should take Julie the same amount of time to process the same number of customers.

The number of customers Julie processes in x minutes is:
Number of customers Julie processes = Customers Jewel processes /Time ratio
= 50 customers / x minutes

To find the weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to find the number of customers they each process in a week and then add them together.

Weekly production for Julie = Number of customers Julie processes per day * Days per week
= (50 customers / x minutes * x minutes) / minutes per day * 7 days

Weekly production for Julie = (50 * x * 7) / minutes per day

Weekly production for Jewel = Customers per day * Days per week
= 50 customers * 7 days

Weekly production for Jewel = 350 customers

Total weekly production for Julie and Jewel = Weekly production for Julie + Weekly production for Jewel
= (50 * x * 7) / minutes per day + 350 customers

We don't have enough information to find the exact value of ""x"" or the minutes per day, so we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, we can express the total weekly production in terms of ""x"".

Step 2: We know that Reggie, Lynn, and Paisley ran races together. Since Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran and 3 miles farther than Lynn, we can set up the equation:

Reggie's miles = 5 * Paisley's miles + Lynn's miles + 3
5X +3 = 5 * X + L + 3

Step 3: Solving this equation for L, we first subtract X and 3 from both sides to simplify:

4X + 0 = L

Step 4: To find the value of L, we need to isolate it on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 4X from both sides:

                 [/INST] To find the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges for Clyde, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. Cost of 4 apples: $5.20
2. Cost of 1 apple: $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30

Now we have the cost of one apple. Next, we'll do the same for three oranges.

3. Cost of 3 oranges: $3.30
4. Cost of 1 orange: $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10

Now, let's find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.

Total cost = (Cost of 5 apples) + (Cost of 5 oranges)

Cost of 5 apples = 5 × Cost of 1 apple = 5 × $1.30 = $6.50
Cost of 5 oranges = 5 × Cost of 1 orange = 5 × $1.10 = $5.50

Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

{The final answer is: Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.}</s>","Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.
Each orange cost $3.30/3 = $<<3.30/3=1.10>>1.10.
So 5 apples cost $1.30 x 5 = $<<5*1.30=6.50>>6.50.
And 5 oranges cost $1.10 x 5 = $<<5*1.1=5.50>>5.50.
Thus, Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $<<6.5+5.5=12>>12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes Bob to dig the hole, we first need to find the total volume of the hole he wants to dig and then convert it into the number of cubic feet of earth that need to be shoveled.

First, let's find the volume of the hole:

1. Length: 6 feet
2. Width: 4 feet
3. Depth: 3 feet

The volume of a rectangular prism (like a box), which describes the shape of the hole, can be calculated using the following formula:

Volume = Length * Width * Depth

Volume of the hole = 6 ft * 4 ft * 3 ft = 144 cubic feet

Now let's find out how long it takes Bob to shovel 144 cubic feet of earth:

1. Volume of the hole: 144 cubic feet
2. Time taken to shovel one cubic foot: 3 seconds

To find the total time it takes Bob to shovel the earth out of the hole, we need to find the product of the volume of the hole and the time taken to shovel one cubic foot:

Total Time = Volume of the hole * Time taken to shovel one cubic foot
Total Time = 144 cubic feet * 3 seconds/cubic foot
Total Time = 432 seconds

Therefore, {The final answer is: It will take Bob 432 seconds, or 7 minutes and 12 seconds, to dig the hole.}</s>","The hole is 6 feet long by 4 feet wide by 3 feet deep or 6 * 4 * 3 = <<6*4*3=72>>72 cubic feet.
Bob shovels a cubic foot of earth every 3 seconds so it will take 72 * 3 = <<72*3=216>>216 seconds to dig the hole.

The base price of the two-ton truck is $30,000.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the king cab upgrade.
The king cab upgrade costs an extra $7,500.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the leather seats.
The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so their cost is:
$7,500 * (1/3) = $2,500

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the towing package.
The cost of the towing package is not given in the problem.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the running boards.
The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, so their cost is:

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the upgraded exterior light package.
The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Step 7: Calculate the total cost of Bill's new truck.
Total cost = Base price + King cab upgrade + Leather seats + Running boards + Upgraded exterior light package
Total cost = $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each one step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the new monthly salary after the 5% raise:
   New monthly salary = Old monthly salary * (1 + Raise percentage)
   New monthly salary = $20000 * (1 + 0.05)
   {The new monthly salary is $21000.}

2. Next, let's calculate the amount of the bonus. Since the bonus is worth half a month's salary, we can find the amount as follows:
   Bonus = Half of the new monthly salary
   Bonus = $21000 / 2
   {The bonus is $10500.}

3. To find the total annual income, we need to add the new monthly salary and the bonus:
   Total annual income = New monthly salary * 12 months + Bonus
   Total annual income = $21000 * 12 + $10500
   {The total annual income is $269200.}

{The final answer is: Tim will make $269,200 in a year.}</s>","The promotion increased his monthly salary by 20000*.05=$<<20000*0.05=1000>>1000
So his new salary is 20000+1000=$<<20000+1000=21000>>21000 a month
So he makes 21000*12=$<<21000*12=252000>>252,000 a year
The bonus is worth 21000*.5=$<<21000*.5=10500>>10500
So he makes 252,000+10,500=$<<252000+10500=262500>>262,500 for the year

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of the suits.
James bought 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. So, the total cost of the suits is:
10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the dress pants.
Each dress pant costs 1/5 of what the suit costs, so the cost of one dress pant is $750 / 5 = $150. James bought 10 dress pants, so the total cost of the dress pants is:
10 dress pants * $150 per pants = $1,500

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the dress shirts.
James bought 3 dress shirts for each suit, and each dress shirt costs $60. So, the total cost of the dress shirts for one suit is:
3 shirts * $60 per shirt = $180
Since there are 10 suits, the total cost of the dress shirts is:
10 suits * $180 per suit = $1,800

Step 4: Add up the total cost of all the items to find the final answer.
The cost of the suits was $7,500, the cost of the dress pants was $1,500, and the cost of the dress shirts was $1,800. So, the total cost of everything is:
$7,500 (suits) + $1,500 (dress pants) + $1,800 (dress shirts) = $10,800

He bought 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 dress shirts
so he spends 30*60=$<<30*60=1800>>1800 on dress shirts
Thus the total cost is 7500+1500+1800=$<<7500+1500+1800=10800>>10,800

                 [/INST] Let's call the original amount of flour in the bag ""x"" (in kilograms). We know that x is divided into 8 portions, each of 2 kg.

First, we need to find the total weight of flour in 8 portions:
8 portions * 2 kg/portion = 16 kg

To find the original amount of flour in the bag before it was divided into portions, we need to find how many 2-kg portions can fit into the bag and then multiply that number by 2 kg/portion:

Number of 2-kg portions that can fit into the bag = Total weight of flour in the bag (in kg) / Weight of 1 portion (2 kg)

We know that the total weight of flour in 8 portions is 16 kg. To find the total weight of flour in 3 bags before it was divided into portions, we need to find the total weight of flour in one bag and then multiply that by 3.

The total weight of flour in one bag before it was divided into portions = Number of portions * Weight of each portion

We know that there are 8 portions in the original bag and each portion is 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of flour in one bag is:
8 portions * 2 kg/portion = 16 kg

To find the total weight of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we multiply the total weight of flour in one bag by 3:

Total weight of flour in three bags = Number of bags * Total weight of flour in one bag
Total weight of flour in three bags = 3 bags * 16 kg/bag = 48 kg

                    question:
                    On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 ? pomegranates at $20 . each. At : the till she got $2 ; off because she had a voucher. ! The next , day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, , but the store also offered a 10% ? discount on the ; total cost. Sheila took advantage . of the : discount and ; bought 20 ? pomegranates. !

                 [/INST] To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, let's calculate the costs step by step:

1. On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. The total cost was: 20 * $20 = $<<20*20=400>>400.
2. She got a $2 discount with her voucher, so the final cost Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday was: $400 - $2 = $<<400-2=399.8>>399.8.

3. On Wednesday, the price of each pomegranate was $30. The total cost for Sheila was: 20 * $30 = $<<20*30=600>>600.
4. Sheila got a 10% discount, which was a reduction of: $600 * 0.1 = $<<600*0.1=60>>60.
5. After the discount, the final cost Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday was: $600 - $60 = $<<600-60=540>>540.

6. To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, subtract the cost Clara paid on Tuesday from the cost Sheila paid on Wednesday: $399.8 - $540 = $<<399.8-540=-140.2>>-140.2.

Since Clara paid less on Tuesday, the difference represents a loss for Clara, so the final answer is that she paid $140.2 less for the pomegranates on Tuesday than she would have on Wednesday. However, the question asked for the difference in the final prices, which was given incorrectly in the problem. The correct answer to the question would be: Clara paid $140.2 less for the pomegranates on Tuesday than what Sheila paid on Wednesday. {The final answer is: $140.2}</s>","On Tuesday, the pomegranates cost Clara 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranates = $<<20*20=400>>400
Using the voucher, she paid $400 - $2 = $<<400-2=398>>398
On Wednesday, the pomegranates cost Sheila 20 pomegranates * $30 = $<<20*30=600>>600.
She then got a discount of 10/100 * $600 = $<<10/100*600=60>>60
Sheila ended up paying $600 - $60 = $<<600-60=540>>540
The difference is therefore $540 - $398 = $<<540-398=142>>142

                    Ariadne has ? a shop selling hats ! of two , different colors, red ! and green. Her ! sales from red ; hats were : $400 in a particular month, ? half ; the ? total amount she earned from ! selling green hats. Calculate : the total amount she made in two months if in ; the ? second month ; her sales were ! 3/4 of the total sales , of the first ! month.
                 [/INST] To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to first find the sales from the second month for both red and green hats, and then add that to the sales from the first month.

Step 1: Find sales from red hats in the second month.
We know that in the first month, sales from red hats were $400. The sales from red hats in the second month were 3/4 of the sales from the first month, so:

Sales from red hats in the second month = 3/4 * Sales from red hats in the first month
Sales from red hats in the second month = 3/4 * $400
Sales from red hats in the second month = $3 * $400
Sales from red hats in the second month = $1200

Step 2: Find sales from green hats in the second month.
We know that sales from green hats in the first month were half of the total sales, so sales from red hats in the first month were $400 + Sales from green hats in the first month = $800. Since sales from green hats in the second month were half of the total sales from both colors in the second month, we have:

Sales from green hats in the second month = 1/2 * (Sales from red hats in the second month + Sales from green hats in the first month)
Sales from green hats in the second month = 1/2 *( $1200 + $800 )
Sales from green hats in the second month = 1/2 *( $2000 )
Sales from green hats in the second month = $1000

Step 3: Find total sales in the second month.
Total sales in the second month = Sales from red hats in the second month + Sales from green hats in the second month
Total sales in the second month = $1200 + $1000
Total sales in the second month = $2200

Step 4: Find total sales in two months.
Total sales in two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
Total sales in two months = $400 + $800 + $1200 + $1000
Total sales in two months = $3200

The final answer is: Ariadne made a total of $3200 in two months.</s>","Since the total sales of red hats were half that of green hats in the first month, she made 2*$400=$<<2*400=800>>800 from green hats.
Her total sales in the first month are $800+$400=$<<800+400=1200>>1200.
In the second month, she made 3/4*1200=$<<3/4*1200=900>>900.
The total amount of money Ariadne made from two months of sales is $1200+$900=$<<1200+900=2100>>2100.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the number of paid hours.
The carriage is hired from 5 PM to 9 PM. The total number of hours is 9 - 5 = 4 hours. However, James gets 1 hour free, so he pays for 3 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the first hour.
The first hour costs $15.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of each hour after the first hour.
Each hour after the first hour costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
James pays for 3 hours. The cost of thefirst hour is $15, and the cost of each of the other 2 hours is $30. So, the total cost is $15 + 2 * $30 = $15 + 2 * $30 = $15 + $60 = $75.

Sally's bank account started the week with $200.
Sally's bank account now holds $420.
Sally has not received any other money into her bank account this week.
Sally's weekly wage should be $300.

Step 2: Find the difference between the initial and final bank balances.
$420 (final balance) - $200 (initial balance) = $220

Step 3: Determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage.
Since Sally's weekly wage is $300 and she currently has $420 in her bank account, we can calculate the amount withheld from her wage by subtracting her initial balance from her final balance and comparing it to her weekly wage.

$420 (final balance) - $200 (initial balance) = $220
$220 is the amount withheld from Sally's wage.

 each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves, so for 16 guests, she needs: 16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves/guest = 48 deviled egg halves
 Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, she needs: 48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves/1 whole egg = 24 eggs

 Step 2: Convert the number of eggs from whole eggs to dozens. We know that 1 dozen equals 12. So, 
24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens

 The final answer is: Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party.</s>","She is inviting 16 guests that will eat 3 deviled egg halves each so she needs 16*3 =<<16*3=48>>48 halves
1 whole egg is needed to make 2 halves so 48 halves is 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 whole eggs

To find out how many pages she has left to write, we need to find the difference between the total number of pages required and the number of pages she has already written.

Step 1: Find the number of pages Sheila has already written.
Sheila has written 1/3 of the research paper. Since each page of the research paper is counted as 1 page, and 1/3 of 15 pages is 5 pages, Sheila has already written 5 pages.

Step 2: Find the number of pages Sheila still needs to write.
To find the number of pages Sheila needs to write, we can subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages required.

Pages left to write = Total number of pages - Pages already written
= 15 pages - 5 pages
= 10 pages

Step 3: Summarize the final answer.

1. Finley bought rice, beans, and pork for their home.
2. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
3. It took Finley 20 minutes more to cook pork than rice.
4. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.

First, let's find out how long it took to cook pork. Since it took 20 minutes more to cook pork than rice (which took 30 minutes), it must have taken 50 minutes to cook pork.

Next, we need to find how long it took to cook beans. We know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the cooking time for pork and rice combined was 30 minutes (for rice) + 50 minutes (for pork) = 80 minutes. Since beans took half that time, it must have taken 80 minutes / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes to cook beans.

Finally, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans: 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = <<30+50+40=120>>120 minutes or 2 hours. {The final answer is 2 hours}.</s>","If rice took thirty minutes to cook, pork took 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.

Cost of mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts: $5 (almonds) + $5 (walnuts) = $10

Next, we'll find the cost of 1/5 pound of almonds and compare it with the cost of the mixture.

Cost of almonds for 1/5 pound: 1/5 * $10 = $4

The difference in cost between 1/2 pound almonds, 1/3 pound walnuts and 1/5 pound almonds is:

                 [/INST] stepped solution:

1. We know that each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. So the number of sheep is X and the number of geese is Y.
2. The total number of animal legs is given by the equation 4X + 2Y = 70.
3. We also know that each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head. So the total number of animal heads is given by X + Y = 20.
4. To solve the system of equations, we can express Y in terms of X in the first equation: Y = (70 - 4X) / 2.
5. We can then substitute Y in the second equation: X + [(70 - 4X) / 2] = 20.
6. To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2: 2X + 70 - 4X = 40.
7. We can simplify the equation by combining the terms with X: -2X = -30.
8. To find the value of X, we can divide both sides of the equation by -2: X = 15.
9. Finally, to find the number of geese, we can substitute X back into the equation for Y: Y = (70 - 4 * 15) / 2 = 5.
10. {The final answer is: there are 15 sheep and 5 geese on Lee's farm.}</s>","Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.
Therefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.
The animals have 2g + 4s = 70 legs.
Using the value of s above, 2g + 4(20-g) = 70.
2g + 80 - 4g = 70.

                 [/INST] To find the total cost of Roger's trip to the store, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive coffee and the donut.

First, let's find the cost of a week's worth of the more expensive coffee. Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, so he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week. The more expensive brand costs $5 per pound plus 20% more:

Cost of 1 pound of more expensive coffee = $5
Cost of 1 pound of more expensive coffee with a 20% increase = $5 × (1 + 0.20) = $5 × 1.2 = $6

So, the cost of a week's worth of the more expensive coffee is:

$6 per pound × 7 pounds = $42

Next, let's find the cost of the donut:

Cost of a donut = $2

Now, let's find the total cost of Roger's trip to the store:

Total cost = Cost of a week's worth of more expensive coffee + Cost of a donut
Total cost = $42 + $2 = $44

{The final answer is: $44}</s>","The coffee he bought was 5*.2=$<<5*.2=1>>1 more expensive per pound than what he normally buys
So it cost 5+1=$<<5+1=6>>6 per pound

1. Gus bought 2 bags of chips, each costing $2.00. So, the total cost of chips is: $2.00 (for one bag) x 2 (number of bags) = $4.00.

2. He spent $8.00 on a bucket of fried chicken.

3. The cost of a bottle of soda is given as $1.00.

4. The total amount Gus spent at the store is $20.00.

5. By adding up the costs of each item, we get the equation: $4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (fried chicken) + $1.00 (soda) + $x (apple pie) = $20.00

6. Simplifying the equation: $13.00 + $x = $20.00

7. Solving for x, we get: x = $7.00

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many hours of class time John is attending in total.
We know that the class meets 4 times a week and for each class session it lasts for 2 hours. So, the number of hours John spends in class per week is:
4 classes/week * 2 hours/class = 8 hours/week

The class lasts for 6 weeks, so the total number of hours John spends in class is:
8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours in total

Step 2: Determine how many new recipes John learns in each hour of class time.
We're told that John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. So, the number of new recipes John learns in one hour is:
1 new recipe/(1.5 hours) = 0.67 recipes/hour

Step 3: Calculate how many new recipes John learns during the entire cooking class.
To find out how many new recipes John learns in total, we can multiply the number of recipes he learns per hour by the number of hours he spends in class:
Number of recipes = 0.67 recipes/hour * 48 hours

To get a more precise answer, we can convert the fraction 0.67 to a decimal number, 0.67 = 0.67 * 10 = 6.7 new recipes per 6 hours, and then divide by 6 to get the number of new recipes per hour.
So, 0.67 recipes/hour * 48 hours = 32.89 recipes, but since John can't learn a fraction of recipe, we round it down to the nearest whole number.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of history teachers.
Given that 60% of the teachers are history teachers, we can calculate the number of history teachers as follows:
Number of history teachers = Total number of teachers * Percentage of history teachers
Number of history teachers = 150 teachers * 0.6
Number of history teachers = 90 teachers

Step 2: Find the number of math teachers.
Since we know the number of history teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:
Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
Number of math teachers = 150 teachers - 90 teachers
Number of math teachers = 60 teachers

Step 3: Calculate the total sleeping hours for all math teachers.
Given that each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we can calculate the total sleeping hours for all math teachers as follows:
Total sleeping hours for math teachers = Number of math teachers * Sleeping hours per teacher per day
Total sleeping hours for math teachers = 60 teachers * 6 hours/teacher
Total sleeping hours for math teachers = 360 hours

                 [/INST] To find out how much each of Rayna and Kassidy has, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the amount of money that Kassidy has as ""x."" Since Rayna has 60 dollars more than Kassidy, we can represent the amount of money Rayna has as ""x + 60.""

Now, we know that Aurelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 of Aurelia's money. Therefore, we can set up another equation: x = 3/4 * $120.

To solve for x, we calculate: x = 3/4 * $120 = $96. So, Kassidy has $96, and Rayna has $156 ($96 + $60).

Now, to find out how much each of Rayna and Kassidy would have if they decided to add their money and share it equally among the three of them, we simply calculate the total amount of money they have and divide it by 3:

Total amount of money = $156 (Rayna) + $96 (Kassidy) = $252

Amount of money each of them would have = $252 / 3 ≈ $84.33

Total game length (without extension) = Quarters per game * Length of one quarter
Total game length (without extension) = 4 * 12
Total game length (without extension) = 48 minutes

Step 3: Add the extension time to find the total length of the game. We know the extension lasted for 5 minutes.

Let's start by calculating the amount of dry ingredients needed for one muffin.

For one muffin, Svetlana uses:
- 5 * ! tablespoons of flour
- 3 tablespoons of ! sugar
- 0.25 of ! a tablespoon of salt

Let's find the total amount of dry ingredients for one muffin in tablespoons:

1. For flour: 5 * ! = 5 * (240) = 1200 tablespoons. However, since 1 pound = 16 ounces and 1 cup = 8 ounces, we know that 1 pound = 2 cups and 1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons. Therefore, 1200 tablespoons is equal to 2000 cups, and since 1 cup is equivalent to 8 tablespoons, we finally have 1200 * 8 = 9600 tablespoons of flour for one muffin.
2. For sugar: 3 tablespoons.
3. For salt: 0.25 * ! = 0.25 * (14) = 3.5 tablespoons.

So, the total amount of dry ingredients for one muffin is 9600 + 3 + 3.5 = 9606.5 tablespoons.

Now that we know how many tablespoons of dry ingredients are needed for one muffin, we can find out how many tablespoons are needed to make 16 muffins:

16 muffins * 9606.5 tablespoons per muffin = 153664.8 tablespoons.

Since we cannot have a fraction of a tablespoon, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Svetlana would need:

- Adam bought 7 candies of type A. The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5, so the total cost of candies of type A is 7 * $0.5 = $3.5.
- Adam bought 10 candies of type B. The cost of one candy of type B is $0.75, so the total cost of candies of type B is 10 * $0.75 = $7.5.
- Therefore, the total cost of candies that Adam bought is $3.5 + $7.5 = $11.

Step 2: Compare the total cost of candies with the amount paid to the cashier.
Since Adam paid $15 to the cashier and the total cost of candies was $11, Adam got a change of $15 - $11 = $4.

1. We know that Christina has had a total of thirty days of mood recordings.
2. She had twelve good days.
3. She had eight bad days.
4. The rest of the days were neutral.

From the given information, we can calculate the number of neutral days as follows:

Total days = Good days + Bad days + Neutral days
30 = 12 + 8 + Neutral days
Neutral days = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10

Next, we know that her first eight days were good, her second eight days were bad, her third eight days were neutral, and the next three days were good.

So out of the thirty days, we have accounted for:

1. The first eight good days
2. The second eight bad days
3. The third eight neutral days
4. The next three good days

This accounts for a total of twenty-one days (8+8+8+3).

Therefore, we can find the number of good days left in the month by subtracting the number of good days that have already occurred from the total number of good days in the month:

Total good days = Good days already had + Good days left
Total good days = 12 + Good days left
Good days left = Total good days - 12
Good days left = 16 - 12 = 4

{The final answer is: There are 4 good days left in the month.}</s>","Christina had 30 - 12 - 8 = <<30-12-8=10>>10 neutral days in the month.

1. We know that Janey has 3 more books than twice the number of books Sally has. So, if Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation:
   Sally's books = (1/2) x (Janey's books + 3)
2. Substitute Janey's number of books (21) into the equation:
   Sally's books = (1/2) x (21 + 3)

                 [/INST] To find out how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches, we need to determine how many inches the bamboo grows each day and then divide the target height by the daily growth rate. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. We know that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day.
2. Today, its height is 20 feet, which is equal to 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches.
3. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to divide the target height by the daily growth rate:
   Days = Target height / Daily growth rate
4. Plugging in the values:
   Days = 600 inches / 30 inches/day

The final answer is:
{The bamboo will reach a height of 600 inches in 20 days}.</s>","Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.
So, the bamboo needs to grow 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 inches more.
Therefore, it will take 360/30 = <<360/30=12>>12 days for its height to be 600 inches.

James had 4 toys for 4 dogs.

Step 3: Find out how many more dogs are in the shelter now.
There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now.

Step 4: Calculate the number of toys needed for the new dogs.
8 new dogs need 8 * 1 = 8 toys.

Step 5: Find out how many toys James bought for the new dogs.
The question states that ""he went back to see that there were twice as many dogs as when he left,"" implying that he bought toys for all of the new dogs. So, James bought toys for 8 dogs, so he bought 8 toys.

Step 6: Find out how many toys James no longer needed.
3 toys were no longer needed because 3 dogs were gone.

Step 7: Calculate the total number of toys James needs.
Initially, James needed toys for 4 dogs, and later, he needed toys for 12 dogs (4 original dogs + 8 new dogs), but he no longer needs 3 toys due to 3 dogs being gone.
So the total number of toys James needs is:
Initial toys for 4 dogs = 4 * 1 = 4

1. We know that three people invested a total of $1200 in a joint savings account.
2. Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount. So, his investment was (2/5) * $1200.
3. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. That means her investment was (2/3) * (total amount - Dylan's investment).
4. Skyler's investment was the rest of the money, which is equal to (total amount - Dylan's investment - Frances' investment).

Now let's calculate each investment:

1. Dylan's investment: (2/5) * $1200 = $1200 * 0.4 = $480
2. Frances' investment: (2/3) * (1200 - 480) = (2/3) * 720 = $480
3. Skyler's investment: total amount - Dylan's investment - Frances' investment = $1200 - $480 - $480 = $240

Since they want to have an equal number of signatures between them, we'll find the difference between the number of signatures Carol has and the number Jennifer has, and then divide that difference by 2 to find out how many more signatures each sister needs to collect.

1. Find the difference in signatures: 44 (Jennifer) - 20 (Carol) = 24
2. Divide the difference by 2 to find out how many more signatures each sister needs: 24 / 2 = 12

So, each sister needs to collect an additional 12 signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures between them.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find Karen's hourly wage.
Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns hourly, we have:
Karen's hourly wage = 2 * Lorie's hourly wage
Karen's hourly wage = 2 * $10/hour
Karen's hourly wage = $20/hour

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings for Karen per day.
Karen earns $20/hour and works 3 hours a day, so:
Karen's daily earnings = Karen's hourly wage * hours worked per day
Karen's daily earnings = $20/hour * 3 hours/day
Karen's daily earnings = $60/day

Step 3: Calculate Karen's total earnings in two days.
Karen's total earnings in 2 days = Karen's daily earnings * number of days

1. We know that Katarina has 5 fewer cookies than Max. So, Max has:
   Max cookies = Katarina cookies + 5

2. We also know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, the Cookie Monster has:
   Cookie Monster cookies = Max cookies - 12

3. Lastly, we know that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, Max has:
   Max cookies = Summer cookies - 23

4. We're given that Katarina has 68 cookies. So, using the first equation above, we can find out how many cookies Max has:

Original length = Final length - (50% of original length) - 20cm

Step 2: Calculate 50% of the original length. Half of 50% is 25%, so we need to find 25% of the final length:

25% of 140cm = 0.25 x 140 = 35cm

Step 3: Subtract the added length from the final length to find the original length:

Original length = 140cm - 35cm - 20cm = 105cm

We know that:
1 hour = 60 minutes
40 minutes = 40 * 60 = 2400 minutes

The lawn can be mowed in 1 hour in turtle mode, so:
Time taken in turtle mode = 1 hour * 60 minutes = 60 minutes

Half of the lawn was mowed in rabbit mode. The other half was mowed in turtle mode, so we'll find the time it took to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode, and then double it to find the total time.

Time taken in rabbit mode = 0.5 * time taken in rabbit mode (given as 40 minutes)

Let's find the time taken in rabbit mode in minutes:
Time taken in rabbit mode = 0.5 * 2400 minutes = 1200 minutes

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of apples.
Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples for $4. So, the cost of apples is 1 kg * $4/kg = $4.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of bananas.
Catherine buys 2. kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo. So, the cost of bananas is 2. kg * $2/kg * 1000g/kg = $4000. Since the cost must be in dollars, we divide by 1000 to get $40. Thus, the cost of bananas is $40.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of oranges.
Catherine buys 2 : kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo. So, the cost of oranges is 2.5 kg * $3/kg * 1000g/kg = $7500. Again, we divide by 1000 to get $75. Thus, the cost of oranges is $75.

Step 4: Find the total amount Catherine pays.
The total amount Catherine pays is the sum of the costs of apples, bananas, and oranges.
Total cost = $4 (for apples) + $40 (for bananas) + $75 (for oranges) = $119.

{The final answer is $119.}</s>","1 kilo of apples costs $<<1*4=4>>4.
2 kilos of bananas costs 2 * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
2 kilos of oranges costs 2 * 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.
She pays 4 + 4 + 6= $<<4+4+6=14>>14 in total.

                 [/INST] To find the age of one of the twins, let's follow these steps:

1. Let x represent the age of one of the twins in the younger set.
2. Since one twin is 7 years older than another, the older twin's age is x + 7.
3. We know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets with a combined age of 44.
4. Since there are two twins, their combined age is 2x + 7 (x for one twin and x+7 for the other).
5. Since there is one set of triplets, their combined age is 3A, where A is the age of one triplet.
6. The problem states that 2x + 7 + 3A = 44.
7. To find x, we need to isolate it. First, let's find A:

3A = 44 - 2x - 7
A = (44 - 2x - 7) / 3

Now we can calculate A and then use that value to find x:

A = (44 - 2x - 7) / 3
A = (37 - 2x) / 3
A(3) = 37 - 2x
3(37 - 2x) = 111
111 = 3(37) - 2(3)(x)
111 = 111 - 6x
0 = -6x
x = 0

This solution indicates that x (age of one twin) is 0, but since the twins' ages are given in years, there's likely a mistake in the problem statement. Let's assume there's a typo and try solving it again with valid ages.

Now, let's try solving the problem with valid ages:

1. Let x represent the age of one of the twins.
2. Since one twin is 7 years older than another, the older twin's age is x + 7.
3. We know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets with a combined age of 44.
4. Since there are two twins, their combined age is 2x + 7.
5. Since there is one set of triplets, their combined age is 3A, where A is the age of one triplet.
6. The problem states that 2x + 7 + 3A = 44.
7. To find x, we need to isolate it. First, let's solve for A:

3A = 44 - 2x - 7
A = (44 - 2x - 7) / 3

Now we can calculate A and then use that value to find x:

A = (44 - 2x - 7) / 3
A = (41 - 2x) / 3
A = (3(13 - x)) / 3
A = 13 - x

The age of one triplet is A = 13 - x. Now we have x in terms of A:

x = 13 - A

We need to check if there are valid ages for both twins and triplets:

- If A is very large, then x would be negative, which cannot be.
- If A is too close to x, there might not be enough age difference between twins.

Let's choose A = 10 as an example, and solve for x and the older twin's age:

x = 13 - A = 13 - 10 = 3
Older twin's age = x + 7 = 3 + 7 = 10

To summarize:

Given x = 3 for one of the twins and A = 10 for one triplet, their ages follow these relationships:

x = 3
Older twin's age = 10
A = 10

This solution satisfies the given condition and is a valid solution.

The final answer is: One of the twins is 3 years old.</s>","Let T = age of triplet
Twin's age = T + <<+7=7>>7
Twin's combined age = 2 * (T + 7)
Triplet's combined age = <<3=3>>3T

2T + 14 + 3T = 44
5T + 14 = 44

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Let's convert this into minutes, as we are working with minutes in the problem.
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework.
Math homework takes 20 minutes, reading homework takes 40 minutes, and history homework takes 20 minutes.
Total time for homework = 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Step 3: Subtract the time John spends on doing his homework from the total time he has, to find out how many minutes he has left for taking a nap.
Total time available for nap = Total time available - Time spent on homework
Total time available = 180 minutes
Time spent on homework = 80 minutes
Time for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

                 [/INST] Step 1: Manolo bought 5 lollipops at $0.40 each. So, the cost of lollipops = 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.

Step 2: Manolo bought 4 candies that cost $3.20 in total. The cost of a candy is then $3.20 / 4 = $0.85 per candy.

Step 3: Manolo wants to buy 10 lollipops, so the cost of 10 lollipops will be 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.

Step 4: Manolo wants to buy 10 candies. Recalling that each candy costs $0.85, the cost of 10 candies will be 10 * $0.85 = $8.50.

Step 5: To find the total cost of buying 10 lollipops and 10 candies, add the cost of lollipops to the cost of candies: $4.00 + $8.50 = $12.50.

{The final answer is: $12.50.}</s>","Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the number of coins Rong saves per month as ""r"" and the number of coins Neil savings per month as ""n"". Since Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong:

n = 2r

Step 2: To find out how many coins they have after 10 years, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil.

First, let's calculate the number of coins Rong saves in 10 years:

Coins saved by Rong in 10 years = Coins saved per month * Months in a year * Years

Coins saved by Rong in 10 years = r * 12 * 10

Step 3: Next, we'll calculate the number of coins Neil saves in 10 years:

Coins saved by Neil in 10 years = Coins saved per month by Neil * Months in a year * Years

Coins saved by Neil in 10 years = n * 12 * 10

Since n = 2r:

Coins saved by Neil in 10 years = 2r * 12 * 10

Step 4: Finally, let's find the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil in 10 years:

Total number of coins saved = Coins saved by Rong + Coins saved by Neil

Total number of coins saved = r * 12 * 10 + 2r * 12 * 10

Total number of coins saved = 12r * 10 + 24r * 10

Total number of coins saved = 120r + 240r

Total number of coins saved = 360r

Step 5: The question asks for the number of coins and not the amount saved in a single coin, so the final answer should be the number of coins represented by the amount ""360r"", which is ""360"" multiplied by the number of coins represented by ""r"". If one coin equals $1, then the answer will be in dollars as well.

Therefore, the final answer depends on the value of ""r"", the number of coins saved by Rong per month. If we know the value of ""r"" in terms of the number of actual coins, we can calculate the final answer. {The final answer is 360r or the number of coins represented by 360 times the number of coins Rong saves per month.}</s>","Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong, a total of 2/5*20 = <<2/5*20=8>>8 more coins.
The total number of coins that Neil has been saving in his piggy month per month is 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 coins.
If Rong has been saving 20 coins every month for ten years, the total number of months he's been saving for is 12*10 = <<12*10=120>>120 months.
Saving 20 coins every month for ten years, Rong has 20*120 = <<20*120=2400>>2400 coins in his piggy bank.
If Neil has also been saving for ten years, he has saved 120*28 = <<120*28=3360>>3360 coins in his piggy bank.
The total number of coins they both have in their piggy banks after ten years of saving is 3360+2400 = <<3360+2400=5760>>5760

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. We know that John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20, and a heartworm check. Let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as C.
2. The problem states that the cost of the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. So we can write: C = 0.6 * (2 * $20 + Total Bill)
3. Substituting the cost of the vaccines ($40) into the equation: C = 0.6 * ($40 + Total Bill)
4. Since we're given that John brought $125 with him, we can write: $125 = $40 + Total Bill
5. Solving for the total bill, we get: Total Bill = $125 - $40 = $85
6. Substituting the total bill back into the equation for C, we get: C = 0.6 * ($85 + $85)
7. Simplifying this expression, we get: C = $69
8. Therefore, the total cost for John is $85 + $69 = $154
9. Since John brought $125 with him, he leaves with $125 - $154 = $<math-$39</math>

The final answer is: John leaves with a loss of $39.</s>","The vaccines cost 40 because 2 x 20 = <<2*20=40>>40

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the price of one banana, one apple, and one orange.
Given that one banana costs twice as much as an apple, so the price of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1. Therefore, the price of one apple is $0.5 and one orange costs three times as much as a banana, so the price of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Step 2: Calculate the number and price of each fruit in the crate.
The crate contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. So the total number of fruits is 5 bananas + 12 apples + 7 oranges = 19 fruits.

The price of bananas is 1 * $1 * 5 = $5.
The price of apples is 1 * $0.5 * 12 = $6.
The price of oranges is 1 * $3 * 7 = $21.

Step 3: Calculate the total price of the crate.
Total price of the crate is the sum of the prices of bananas, apples, and oranges: $5 (bananas) + $6 (apples) + $21 (oranges) = $<<5+6+21=22>>22.

One orange is three times more expensive than a banana, so it costs 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.
So for the oranges in the crate, one needs to pay 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.
So the whole crate costs 6 + 5 + 21 = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.

                 [/INST] To find the total number of squares and the area of Brittany's comforter, we first need to determine the number of squares for each color based on the given information.

1. We know there are 14 red squares, and there are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.
2. There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.
3. There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Having established the number of squares for each color, we can now calculate the total area of the comforter in square feet.

The area of one square is 1 foot by 1 foot, or 1 square foot. Thus, the total area of the comforter is the sum of the areas of all of its colored squares:

Area of comforter = Area of red squares + Area of blue squares + Area of green squares + Area of white squares

Calculate the area for each color:

Area of red squares = Number of red squares * Area per square = 14 * 1 square foot = 14 square feet
Area of blue squares = Number of blue squares * Area per square = 18 * 1 square foot = 18 square feet
Area of green squares = Number of green squares * Area per square = 24 * 1 square foot = 24 square feet
Area of white squares = Number of white squares * Area per square = 12 * 1 square foot = 12 square feet

Total area = 14 square feet (red) + 18 square feet (blue) + 24 square feet (green) + 12 square feet (white)

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of chairs needed for adults.
Since there are 42 adults attending, and we don't know how many chairs one adult requires, let's assume each adult requires one chair. In this case, 42 adults would require 42 chairs.

Step 2: Determine the number of chairs needed for babies.
There are 15 babies attending, and each baby requires a high chair. So, 15 babies would require 15 high chairs.

Step 3: Find out how many regular chairs there are currently.
The problem states that there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. There are currently 8 high chairs, so there must be 5 * 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 regular chairs.

Step 4: Determine the total number of chairs that Mia currently has.
Total number of chairs = Regular chairs + High chairs = 40 + 8 = <<40+8=48>>48

Step 5: Find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get.
To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to have for all the attendees, we need to determine the number of chairs for all attendees (adults and babies) and subtract the number of chairs she already has.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs needed for all attendees. Since 42 adults require 42 chairs and 15 babies require 15 high chairs, the total number of chairs required would be 42 (for adults) + 15 (for babies) = <<42+15=57>>57.

Step 6: Find the difference between the required number of chairs and the number of chairs Mia currently has.
Chairs needed = 57

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know there are 50 deer in the field.

Step 2: We're told that 50% of these deer are bucks. So we calculate the number of bucks:
50 bucks = (50 total deer) * (0.5 buck percentage)

Step 3: Now we're told that 20% of these bucks are 8-point bucks. We'll calculate the number of 8-point bucks:
number of 8-point bucks = (number of bucks) * (0.2 8-point percentage)

Substituting the previous calculation into our new equation gives:
number of 8-point bucks = (50 bucks) * (0.2 8-point percentage)

Step 4: To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to multiply the number of bucks by the percentage of 8-point bucks. In this case, we have:
number of 8-point bucks = 50 bucks * 0.2

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of points collected by Martha and Tom.
- We know that Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so Betty has 1.3 * 50 = <<1.3*50=65>>65 points.
- We also know that Marta collects 3 times more points than Tom, and Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has Betty's points - 30 = <<Betty.points-30>>57 points. Marta then has 3 * Tom's points = <<3*(Betty.points-30)>>171 points.

Step 2: Find the total number of points collected by all students.
- We have Adam with 50 points, Betty with 65 points, and Marta with 171 points, so the total number of points is 50 + 65 + 171 = <<50+65+171=286>>286 points.

Step 3: Determine if the class has enough points to go on the trip.
- The total number of points (286) is less than the minimum threshold (400), so the class is missing points to go on the trip.

Step 4: Find the number of points the class is missing.
- The class needs a total of 400 points, so the number of points they are missing is 400 - 286 = <<400-286=114>>114 points. {The final answer is 114 points}.</s>","Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.
So the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on the trip.

Step 2: Next, let's find out how many pounds of gravel Gordy's truck can carry. We know that it can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. So, we need to add 800 pounds to the weight that Gissela's truck can carry: 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Step 3: We're given that the three trucks combined can carry a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. So, we need to add the weight that both Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry: 4,000 (Gissela) + 4,800 (Gordy) = 8,800 pounds.

Step 4: Now we know that there are three trucks and their combined weight is 8,800 pounds. So, we can calculate the weight of Gary's truck by subtracting the weight of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total: 8,800 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 0, which is not possible since Gary's truck has a positive weight.

Total number of people = 14

Step 2: Determine the number of dumplings each female ate.
Each female ate 3 dumplings.

Step 3: Determine the number of dumplings each male ate.
Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of dumplings required for the group if there were no leftovers.
Total number of dumplings = Number of dumplings for females + Number of dumplings for males
Total number of dumplings = 6 (females) × 3 (dumplings each) + 8 (males) × 4 (dumplings each)
Total number of dumplings = 18 + 32
Total number of dumplings = 50

{The final answer is: Larry cooked 50 dumplings.}</s>","So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.
Hence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.

So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is 18 + 32 = <<18+32=50>>50.

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how much money Gerald and Julia each got according to the given ratio 3:2. This means that Gerald got 3 parts of the $100 and Julia got 2 parts.

We know that the sum of parts of a ratio equals the total amount of money. So, the parts for Gerald ($G) and Julia ($J$) should satisfy the following equation:

$G + J = 100$

Because Gerald got 3 parts and Julia got 2 parts, we can write this equation as:

$G + 2G = 100$

Solving the equation by combining the terms on the left side:

$3G = 100$

Now, we can find out how much money Gerald originally got by dividing both sides by 3:

$G = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33$

Since Gerald spent $10 on a book, we now have to subtract that amount from his original money to find out how much he has left:

$Money_left = G - 10 = \approx 33.33 - 10 \approx 23.33$

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final amount of money Gerald has left is approximately $23.33.}</s>","The $100 was divided into 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 parts.
So each part is $100/5 = $<<100/5=20>>20.
So Gerald received $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.
Gerald bought a book at $<<10=10>>10.
Therefore, Gerald was left with $60 - $10 = $<<60-10=50>>50.

1. The cat runs at a speed of 15 feet/second.
2. The cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. So, the turtle's speed is 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second.

Now, we want to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds.

3. To calculate the distance the turtle can cover in 40 seconds, we just need to multiply its speed by the time it takes to travel that distance.

4. Distance = Speed * Time
5. Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds = 120 feet

{The final answer is: The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.}</s>","First find the speed of the turtle by dividing the cat's speed by 5: 15 feet/second / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 feet/second

Step 3: Determine how long it takes to raise the difference between what they have now and their goal.
$6300 (their goal) - $2100 (what they have raised) = $4200
$4200 / Amount they need to raise per hour = Number of hours they need to fundraise for

$4200 / (amount they need to raise per hour)

{The final answer is Number of hours they need to fundraise for}

To calculate the actual number of hours, you need to divide the remaining amount to be raised by the amount raised per hour. With the given information, this calculation cannot be performed directly, but it's clear that the firefighters need to continue fundraising for some more hours beyond the initial 3 hours.</s>","The fireman raise 2100 / 3 = $<<2100/3=700>>700 per hour.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that the city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Let's represent this as ""x"" so we can perform calculations.

x = Colorado River water used by the city

Step 2: We're told that 80% of the water used by the city is used for industrial purposes. This means that 20% of the water is used for non-industrial purposes.

Industrial water usage = 0.8 * x
Non-industrial water usage = 0.2 * x

Step 3: Our question asks for the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes. We're given that the city uses 40% of the total river's water, but we don't have a total amount for the river's water. However, we do know that 20% of this amount is used for non-industrial purposes.

Let's denote the total amount of water in the Colorado River as ""y"".

Total water in the Colorado River = y

Water used by the city = 0.4 * y

Water used by the city for non-industrial purposes = 0.2 * x

Step 4: We want to find the percentage of the Colorado River's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Percentage of non-industrial water usage = ({non-industrial water usage} / {total water in the Colorado River}) * 100%

Percentage of non-industrial water usage = ({0.2 * x} / {y}) * 100%

Step 5: To find the answer, we would need to know the total water amount in the Colorado River (y), which was not provided in the question. As it stands, we cannot calculate the exact percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Therefore, the problem as currently presented cannot be answered with a definitive percentage.</s>","First find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes: 100% - 80% = 20%
Then multiply that percentage by the percentage of water taken from the river: 20% * 40% = 8%

First, let's calculate the number of days in 2 weeks:
2 * 7 = 14 Days

Now that we know there are 14 days in 2 weeks, let's calculate the total amount Alex charges:
Total Charges = Daily Rate * Number of Days
Total Charges = $12/day * 14 days

1. We know that both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy for Halloween.
2. Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so the number of pieces of candy she has after 'd' days is given by the formula: 100 - 4 * d.
3. Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so the number of pieces of candy she has after 'd' days is given by the formula: 100 - 3 * d.
4. To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks (14 days), we need to find the difference between the number of pieces of candy she has and the number of pieces of candy Ginger has after 14 days.
5. Let's calculate the number of pieces of candy each person has after 14 days:
   - Ginger's pieces of candy after 14 days: 100 - 4 * 14 = 100 - 56 = 44
   - Amy's pieces of candy after 14 days: 100 - 3 * 14 = 100 - 42 = 58

Step 2: Find out how many square feet Mr. Boarden wants to cover with mosaic tiles.
Two-thirds of 36 square feet is:
2/3 * 36 = 22.4 square feet
Since we cannot cover a fraction of a square foot with tiles, we will round up to the nearest whole number, which is 23 square feet.

Step 3: Calculate the number of mosaic tiles required.
For 23 square feet, Mr. Boarden will need:
23 square feet * 24 mosaic tiles/square foot = 552 mosaic tiles

2. The cost of picking blueberries is an additional $1.5 per pound.
3. James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.
4. The cost of buying blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound.

First, let's calculate the total cost of picking blueberries from the farm:
Total cost = Cost to go to the farm + Cost per pound of blueberries picked
Total cost = $20 + ($1.5 * 30 pounds)
Total cost = $20 + $45
Total cost = $65

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store:
Cost at store = Number of pounds of blueberries * Cost per pound at the store
Cost at store = 30 pounds * $2.5 per pound
Cost at store = $75

Finally, let's find the difference in cost between picking the blueberries from the farm and buying them at the store:
Difference in cost = Cost at farm - Cost at store
Difference in cost = $65 - $75
Difference in cost = -$10 (note that the result is negative, indicating that James spent more money buying blueberries from the store rather than picking them from the farm)

Since the difference in cost is negative, it means that James spent more money buying blueberries at the store than he did picking them from the farm.

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices on each pizza. Each pizza had 12 slices.

Step 3: Determine how many slices Bryce and two friends ate. They ate 2/3 of their pizzas, so 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices each, which totals to 2 * 8 = 16 slices for Bryce and his 2 friends.

Step 4: Determine how many slices the other two friends ate. They ate ¾ of their pizzas, so ¾ * 12 = 9 slices each, which totals to 2 * 9 = 18 slices for the other two friends.

Step 5: Subtract the number of slices eaten by both groups to find out how many slices are left. 12 * 5 (total number of slices on the 5 pizzas) = 60 slices. 16 (slices Bryce and his friends ate) + 18 (slices the other two friends ate) = 34 slices were consumed. 60 - 34 = {26 slices were left}. {The final answer is 26 slices.}</s>","Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.

                 [/INST] Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. To find the time it takes for the cat to eat one sausage, we need to divide the number of sausages by the time it takes to eat them.

Time taken by the cat to eat one sausage = Total time / Number of sausages
Time taken by the cat to eat one sausage = 30 minutes / 9 sausages = 3.33 minutes per sausage (approximately)

2. The dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat to eat them. So, the time it takes for the dog to eat one sausage is:

Time taken by the dog to eat one sausage = Time taken by the cat / 3/2
Time taken by the dog to eat one sausage = 3.33 minutes / (3/2)
Time taken by the dog to eat one sausage = 2.22 minutes per sausage (approximately)

3. To find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat one sausage, we can simply find the arithmetic mean of their individual times.

Average time to eat one sausage = (Time taken by cat to eat one sausage + Time taken by dog to eat one sausage) / 2
Average time to eat one sausage = (3.33 minutes + 2.22 minutes) / 2

Average time to eat one sausage = 2.73 minutes (approximately)

{The final answer is: The average time for the cat and the dog to eat one sausage is approximately 2.73 minutes.}</s>","If the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes 2/3*30 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 minutes.
The total amount of time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.
The average time in minutes that the two take to eat the sausages is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

                 [/INST] Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet 4 inches, which is equivalent to 8 x 12 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.
2. We're told that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:
   Length of one Bobby's shoe = Length of one Topher's shoe - 10 inches
   = 100 inches - 10 inches
   = 90 inches
3. Since we know that Length of one Bobby's shoe = 9 x Length of one Bobby's shoe, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9 to find the length of one Bobby's shoe in inches:
   Length of one Bobby's shoe = Length of one Bobby's shoe * 1 (divided by 9)
   = 90 inches / 9
   = 10 inches

The final answer is that the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.</s>","Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.
Subtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90
Solving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10

At 8:00 am, there were 5000 people who had not voted yet.

By midday (12:00 pm), 2/5 of the people had voted. So, 3/5 of the people had not voted yet:

3/5 * 5000 = 3000

So, there were 3000 people who had not voted by midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. Let's find out how many people had not voted at that point:

Let's first find how many people had voted by 16:00. We know that at midday, there were 3000 people who had not voted, and 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by 16:00. Since there were originally 5000 people, we can calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00:

5000 * 2/3 = 3333.333

Since we can't have a fractional person, we'll round to the nearest integer, getting 3334. So, 3334 people had voted by 16:00.

Therefore, the remaining number of people who had not voted by 16:00 was:

5000 - 3334 = 1666

Each sleeve makes the base for 8 large smores.

Step 2: Calculate how many bases are needed for the kids.
9 kids want 2 smores each, so they need 9 * 2 = 18 smores.

Step 3: Calculate how many bases are needed for the adults.
6 adults will eat 1 smore each, so they need 6 smores.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of bases needed.
Total number of bases needed = smores for kids + smores for adults = 18 + 6 = 24.

Step 5: Calculate how many sleeves are needed to make that number of bases.
One sleeve makes 8 bases, so we need ceil(total bases / bases per sleeve) sleeves.
ceil(24 / 8) = 3 sleeves or 4 sleeves (rounding up to the nearest whole number)

Step 6: Finally, calculate how many boxes are needed to have 3 or 4 sleeves.
Each box contains 3 sleeves, so we need ceil(sleeves needed / sleeves per box) boxes.
ceil(3 / 3) = 1 box if using exactly 3 sleeves

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the variables and their relationships from the problem statement.
Let's define the following variables:
- D: Dora's age
- F: Dora's father's age
- M: Dora's mother's age

From the problem statement:
1. F = D + 8
2. M = D - 4

Step 2: Solve for Dora's father's age (F) and mother's age (M) in terms of Dora's age (D).
Since F = D + 8 and M = D - 4, we will first find an expression for F in terms of D and then do the same for M.

F = D + 8

M = D - 4

Step 3: Substitute the expressions for F and M in terms of D into the equation for the total combined age: F +M+D

First, we'll find expressions for F and M in terms of D:
F = D+8
M = D-4

Now we substitute these expressions into the total combined age equation F+M+D:

F+M+D = (D+8) + (D-4) + D

Step 4: Simplify the equation

To simplify the equation, first, bring all the D terms to one side:

F+M+D = D + D + D + 8 - 4

Now combine the terms with D:

F+M+D = 3D + 4

Step 5: Find the value of 3D+4

Now we need to find the value of 3D+4 in terms of Dora's age (D). We can use the following expressions we derived earlier:

F = D+8
M = D-4

Since Dora is 15 years old, we can substitute D with 15 in our expressions for F and M:

F = 15+8 = 23
M = 15-4 = 11

Now we can find the value of 3D+4. First, substitute D with 15:

3D+4 = 3(15)+4

Calculate the value of the expression:

3D+4 = 45+4 = 49

Step 6: The final answer

{The final answer is: Dora, her father (23 years old), and her mother (11 years old) have a combined age of 49 years.}</s>","If Dora's age is 15, her father, with eight more than twice Dora's age, is eight more than 15*2 = <<15*2=30>>30 years.
This means Dora's father is 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.
Together, Dora and her father have a total age of 38+15 =<<38+15=53>>53.
Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, meaning Dora's mother is 38-4 = 34 years old.
Altogether, Dora's family has a total age of 53+34 = <<53+34=87>>87 years.

2. Greg found $20.
3. He decided to split the money equally among his siblings.

- Medium cubes: 7
- Small cubes: 8

Step 2: Find out the amount of water used for making each size of cube:
- Water used for giant cubes: 4 ounces
- Water used for medium cubes: 2 ounces
- Water used for small cubes: 1/2 ounce

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water used for making each size of cube:
- Water used for giant cubes: 3 (number of giant cubes) * 4 (ounces of water per giant cube) = 12 ounces
- Water used for medium cubes: 7 (number of medium cubes) * 2 (ounces of water per medium cube) = 14 ounces
- Water used for small cubes: 8 (number of small cubes) * 1/2 (ounces of water per small cube) = 4 ounces

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of water used for all sizes of cubes:

First, let's find how many books Clara has when she has 20 more books than Steven.

Clara has 2s books and Steven has s books. The difference between the number of books they have is 2s - s = s * 1 + s * 1. In other words, the difference is 2 * s.

Now, we're told that Clara has 20 more books than Steven when she has 20 books, so we set up the following equation:

Clara books = 2 * Steven books + 20
2s = 2 * s + 20

Subtract 2s from both sides to isolate the term with s:

s = 20

Since Steven has s = 20 books, Alice has s + 6 = 26 books.

Now, find the difference between Clara and Alice:

Clara books = 2s = 2 * 20 = 40
Alice books = s + 6 = 20 + 6 = 26

Difference = 40 - 26 = 14

                 [/INST] Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and a half-gallon jar costs $3 less than that, so we can find the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from the gallon jar price:
   Half-gallon jar cost = Gallon jar cost - $2
   Half-gallon jar cost = $5 - $2
   Half-gallon jar cost = $3

2. Next, we calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars:
   Gallon jars cost = Number of gallon jars * Gallon jar cost
   Gallon jars cost = 10 * $5
   Gallon jars cost = $50

3. We also calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 16 half-gallon jars:
   Half-gallon jars cost = Number of half-gallon jars * Half-gallon jar cost
   Half-gallon jars cost = 16 * $3
   Half-gallon jars cost = $48

4. Finally, we add the costs of the gallon and half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:
   Total amount spent = Gallon jars cost + Half-gallon jars cost
   Total amount spent = $50 + $48
   Total amount spent = $98

The problem states that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who prefer playing basketball, so:

z = x + y + Number_of_students_who_like_to_play_music
Number_of_students_who_like_to_play_music = 2 * y

We're asked to find the number of students who like to play video games. Since all the students either like to play video games or music, and the number of students who like to play music is given as 2 * y, the number of students who like to play video games is the difference between the total number of students and the number of students who like to play music:

z = x + y + 2 * y = x + 3 * y

Step 2: The number of birds remaining in the backyard is the initial number minus the number scared away, so 12 - 4 = 8 birds.

Step 3: After a few minutes, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. So, the new number of birds in the backyard is 8 (remaining birds) + 20 (new birds) = 28 birds.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that there are two classes in the school with a total of 80 students. Since each class has an equal number of students, let's find the number of students in one class:

Number of students in one class = Total number of students / 2
Number of students in one class = 80 / 2
Number of students in one class = 40

Step 2: We are also given that 40% of the students in each class are girls. So, we need to find the number of girls in one class:

Number of girls in one class = Percentage of girls * Number of students
Number of girls in one class = 0.4 * 40
Number of girls in one class = 16

Step 3: Since there are equal numbers of boys and girls in each class, we can find the number of boys in one class:

Number of boys in one class = Number of students in one class - Number of girls in one class
Number of boys in one class = 40 - 16
Number of boys in one class = 24

{The final answer is: 24 boys in each class}</s>","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.
The girls in each class make up to 40%, so there are 40/100 * 40 = <<40/100*40=16>>16 girls in each of them.
That means the rest of the class are boys, so there are 40 - 16 = <<40-16=24>>24 boys in each class.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mara started with 2 slices on the plate.
2. She added 3 slices, so now there are 2 + 3 = <<2+3=5>>5 slices on the plate.
3. Mara ate 2 slices, so there are 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3 slices left on the plate.
4. Her friend stole 5 slices, so there are 3 - 5 = <<3-5=-2>>-2 slices left on the plate. {The final answer is: There are -2 slices of cake left on the plate.}

Note that this answer might not make much sense in the real world, as it implies that there are less slices than what were initially on the plate.

                 [/INST] To find out how many animals Melissa grooms each day of the week, we first need to find out the total number of animals she needs to groom and then divide that number by the number of days in a week. so lets calculate:

Total number of dogs = 8
Total number of cats = 5
Total number of birds = 3
Total number of horses = 12

Total number of animals = 8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 26 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 46 animals

There are 7 days in a week, so:

Number of animals groomed per day = Total number of animals / Number of days in a week = 46 animals / 7 days = ≈6.59 animals per day.

However, since Melissa can't groom a fraction of an animal, she'll have to groom more than one animal per day to keep up with the demand. To find the exact number, let's calculate how many animals can be groomed in one day by rounding up the quotient:

Number of animals groomed per day = 7 (ceil of 6.59) = 7 animals

{The final answer is: Melissa grooms 7 animals per day.}</s>","Melissa has 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = <<8+5+3+12=28>>28 animals to groom over the next week.
Therefore, She will groom 28 / 7 = <<28/7=4>>4 animals each day.

                 [/INST] To calculate Mark's profit, we first need to find out how much money he spent on buying the magic cards and then find the total value of the cards he obtained.

1. Mark bought 3 packs of magic cards at $1800 each, so the total cost was:
   Cost = Number of packs * Cost per pack
   Cost = 3 * $1800
   Cost = $5400

2. Mark obtained two high-value cards worth $4000 and $1000. So, the total value of these cards is:
   Total value of high-value cards = $4000 + $1000 = $5000

3. Mark also obtained 30 cards with an average value of $50 each. So, the total value of these cards is:
   Total value of common cards = Number of common cards * Average value per card
   Total value of common cards = 30 * $50
   Total value of common cards = $1500

4. To find the profit, we need to subtract the amount spent from the total value of the cards obtained:
   Profit = Total value of cards obtained - Cost

5. So, the total value of the cards Mark obtained is:
   Total value of cards obtained = Total value of high-value cards + Total value of common cards
   Total value of cards obtained = $5000 + $1500
   Total value of cards obtained = $6500

{The final answer is: Mark made a profit of $1100 ($6500 - $5400).}</s>","The cheaper cards are worth a total of 30*50=$<<30*50=1500>>1500

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of each amusement park for the given family size.

For the first amusement park:
Cost for adults = $26 * number of adults = $26 * 2 = $52
Cost for children = $12 * number of children = $12 * 2 = $24
Total cost for first amusement park = $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park:
Cost for adults = $14 * number of adults = $14 * 2 = $28
Cost for children = $10 * number of children = $10 * 2 = $20
Total cost for second amusement park = $28 + $20 = $48

Step 2: Find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks.

Difference in cost = Cost of first amusement park - Cost of second amusement park = $76 - $48 = $28

So, they will pay a total of $52 + $24 = $<<52+24=76>>76 for the first amusement park.
The two adults pay $14 x 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28 for the second amusement park.
While the two children's tickets for the second amusement park cost $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.

- He sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- He used to buy them at $0.5 each.

Money spent on tomatoes per day = Number of tomatoes * Price per tomato
= 500 tomatoes * $0.5/tomato

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money the vendor spends on tomatoes with the new vendor.
- He now buys tomatoes at $0.4 each.

Money spent on tomatoes per day (new vendor) = Number of tomatoes * Price per tomato

1. Six groups are to be formed from fifty-four students.
2. The number of students in each group should be equal.
3. Let x be the number of students in one group.
4. We know that the total number of students is 54, so x * 6 = 54.

6. Thus, each group has 9 students.

Now, we know that twelve groups are needed in total:

1. Twelve groups are required.
2. Each group has 9 students.
3. So, to find the number of students needed for twelve groups, we multiply the number of students per group by the number of groups: 9 * 12 = 108.
4. However, we already have sixty students, which is 12 short of the 108 required to form twelve groups of nine.

- On weekends: 100 chairs/day * 2 days/weekend * 4 weekends/month = 800 chairs/month

Step 2: Find the total number of chairs rented out in one month.
Total chairs rented out in one month = Chairs rented out on weekdays * number of weeks in a month + Chairs rented out on weekends * number of weekends in a month
- Total chairs rented out in one month = 420 chairs/week * 4 weeks/month + 800 chairs/2 weeks/month * 2 weekends/month

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of glasses and plates Jeff had before the event.
Jeff sent 8 Dozens (8 x 12 = 96) of glasses and 4 Dozens (4 x 12 = 48) of plates to the event.
So, Jeff had 96 glasses + 48 plates = 144 items in total before the event.

Step 2: Determine the number of glasses and plates that were returned.
10 glasses were broken and 6 plates were damaged. So, Jeff received 96 glasses - 10 = 86 glasses back and 48 plates - 6 = 42 plates back.

Step 3: Determine the number of glasses and plates Jeff has now.
The total number of items Jeff has now is 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items.

The final answer is: Jeff has 128 glasses and plates in total now.</s>","He had 8 dozen glasses so he had 8*12 = <<8*12=96>>96 glasses
He had 4 dozen plates so he had 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 plates
10 glasses were broken and he started with 96 so he now has 96-10= 86 glasses
6 plates were broken and he started with 48 so he now has 48-6 = <<48-6=42>>42
All total he has 86 glasses and 42 plates so 86+42 = <<86+42=128>>128 glasses and plates

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons.
Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers, so the number of large buttons she gets is:
30 small stickers * 90% = 27 small stickers * 3 large buttons/small sticker = 81 large buttons

Step 2: Calculate the number of large stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons.
Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers, so the number of large buttons she gets is:
40 large stickers * 50% = 20 large stickers

Step 3: Calculate the number of small stickers Lorraine gets in return for trading her remaining large stickers.
Since 1 large button is worth 3 small stickers, the number of small stickers Lorraine gets is:
20 large stickers * 3 small stickers/large sticker = 60 small stickers

Step 4: Calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end of the trading.
The number of buttons Lorraine has is the sum of the buttons she started with and the buttons she got from trading:
30 small stickers (initially) * 1 small button/small sticker = 30 small buttons (initially)
40 large stickers (initially) * 3 large buttons/large sticker = 120 large buttons (initially)
27 large buttons (obtained from trading small stickers)
81 (from this she got 27 large buttons, so she gave away 54 large buttons, which is equal to 162 small buttons)
162 small buttons (obtained from trading large buttons)

So, the total number of buttons Lorraine has is: 30 (initial small buttons) + 27 (large buttons from trading small stickers) + 120 (initial large buttons) + 162 (small buttons from trading large buttons) = 279 buttons

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We know that the number of votes in favor of the new regulation was twice the number of votes against it.
2. Let x be the number of votes against the new regulation.
3. Then, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation was 2x.
4. We also know that the total number of people on the council is 33.
5. Since every person on the council votes, we have the formula: x (votes against) + 2x (votes in favor) = 33 (total number of people).
6. That gives us a simple quadratic equation: 3x = 33.
7. Solving this equation, we get x = 11.
8. So there were 11 votes against the new regulation, meaning there were 21 * 2 = 42 votes in favor of it.

The final answer is: There were 42 votes in favor of the new regulation.</s>","Let V be the number of votes against the new regulation.
There were twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation, so V + 2V = 3V = 33.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Krissa needs to order shirts for her preschool students. Let's find out how many shirts of each size she needs.

2. 11 students need size extra-small.
3. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so we need to find out how many students need size small: 2 * 11 = 22 students.
4. Four students less than the number of size medium students are needed: Let's denote the number of students needing size medium as x. So, x - 4 students need size medium.
5. Half as many students need size large as size medium: Half of x students need size large.
6. Six more students need size extra-large than size large: Let's denote the number of students needing size large as l. So, l + 6 students need size extra-large.

7. To find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we need to calculate the number of shirts for each size:
   - Extra-small: 11 shirts
   - Small: 22 shirts
   - Medium: x shirts
   - Large: l shirts
   - Extra-large: l + 6 shirts

8. To solve for x and l, we have two equations:
   - x - 4 = (1/2)(l + 6)
   - x = 2 * 11 + 22

9. For the second equation, we can calculate x = 44 + 22 = 66.

10. Substituting x = 66 into the first equation, we have 66 - 4 = (1/2)(l + 6). Solving for l:
   - l + 6 = 134/2
   - l + 6 = 67
   - l = 61

11. Thus, Krissa ordered shirts for 11 extra-small students, 22 small students, 66 medium students, 61 large students, and 61 extra-large students.

{The final answer is: Krissa ordered a total of 66 + 22 + 66 + 61 + 61 = 252 shirts}</s>","Krissa ordered 11 x 2 = <<11*2=22>>22 size small.

The problem states that a bag marked $140 has a 5% discount. We need to find out how much the discounted price will be.

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount
Discount amount = Original price * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $140 * 0.05
Discount amount = $7

Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the original price
Discounted price = Original price - Discount amount
Discounted price = $140 - $7
Discounted price = $133

Each song is 10 hours long. The duration of one playlist, which contains 15 songs, is:
15 songs * 10 hours per song = 150 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total duration of all playlists.
Each playlist lasts for 150 hours, and there are 20 playlists in total. The total duration is:

Step 1: Find the number of people who think horse #2 will win:
20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win.
So, the number of people is 0.2 * 50 = <<0.2*50=10>>10 people.

Step 2: Find the number of people who think horse #7 will win:
60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.
Let's denote the total number of people as P. The number of people who think horse #2 will win is 10. So, the number of people who weren't thinking about horse #2 is P - 10. Now, 60% of them think horse #7 will win. So, the number of people is 0.6 * (P - 10).

Step 3: Find the number of people who think horse #12 will win:
The number of people who don't think about horses #2 or #7 winning is P - 10 - (0.6 * (P - 10)). After calculating this, we'll find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, which is the rest of the people.

Let P = 100 (for simplicity). We'll calculate the number of people for this value and then find the general formula.

Step 1: People thinking horse #2 will win = 10
Step 2: People thinking horse #7 will win = 0.6 * (P - 10) = 62
Step 3: People remaining = P - 10 - 62 = 28
Step 4: People thinking horse #12 will win = P - 10 - 62 = 16

So, when there are 100 people in total, 16 people think horse #12 will win.

{The final answer is 16}

For the general formula, assuming P is the total number of people:

People thinking horse #2 will win = 10
People thinking horse #7 will win = 0.6 * (P - 10)
People remaining = P - 10 - 0.6 * (P - 10)
                    = 0.4 * P - 11.2
People thinking horse #12 will win = P - 10 - 0.6 * (P - 10) - (0.6 * 0.4 * P + 0.2 * P)
                                          = P - 10 - (0.42 * P - 3.24)
                                          = 1.58 * P - 3.24

So, the number of people thinking horse #12 will win is a function of the total number of people, 'P', given by:

Given:
1. Three contractors (Rob, Royce, and Pedro) are getting ready to put a new roof on three homes.
2. The three homes will need a total of 250 cases of shingles.
3. The second house will need 1/2 of the shingles required by the first house.
4. The third house will need double the amount of shingles required by the first house.

We want to find out how many cases of shingles the third house requires.

Step 2: Identify the variables.
Let's denote the number of cases of shingles required by the first house as x.

Step 3: Solve the problem using given information.
1. According to the problem, the second house will need 1/2 of the shingles required by the first house. So, the second house will need x/2 cases of shingles.
2. The third house will need double the amount of shingles required by the first house. So, the third house will need 2x cases of shingles.

Step 4: Check whether all the houses will have enough shingles in total.
1. The total number of cases of shingles is 250.
2. The first house requires x cases of shingles.
3. The second house requires x/2 cases of shingles.
4. The third house requires 2x cases of shingles.
5. Thus, x + x/2 + 2x = 250 => 3x = 500 => x = 166.67 (approximately, since we are dealing with houses and not exact numbers)

Since each number of cases must be an integer, the problem has an inconsistency with the given total shingles and the given ratio for each house.

Step 5: Identify the final answer.
I couldn't provide a clear final answer since the problem had an inconsistency.

However, generally speaking, the third house would need 2 * (first house's requirement), which, based on our calculation above, would be 2 * 166.67 = 333.34 (approximately). Since this is a large number and we know that the problem is inconsistent, the provided information suggests that 250 cases might not be enough for all three houses if the described ratios are accurate.

Additional note: It is essential to check for inconsistencies like this in a problem before attempting to find a solution. If the given information in the problem isn't sufficient or accurate, there may not be a reasonable solution.</s>","Let x be the number of cases of shingles for the second house
The first house needs 1/2 x cases of shingles

                 [/INST] Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Leila buys 3 cucumbers for $2 each, so she spends 3 × $2 = <<3*2=6>>6 on cucumbers.

2. Jack buys 0.5 kg tomatoes for $1 each. Since the price is given per kilogram, we need to find out how much Jack spends on 0.5 kg tomatoes. We do this by multiplying the number of tomatoes (or kilograms) by the price per kilogram: 0.5 × $1/kg = $<<0.5*1=0.5>>0.5.

3. Chase buys 1 head of lettuce for $3 each. So, the cost of the lettuce is $3.

4. To find the total amount spent by all three people on their salad ingredients, we add up their individual costs: 6 (Leila's cucumbers) + 0.5 (Jack's tomatoes) + 3 (Chase's lettuce).

{The final answer is}: 6 + 0.5 + 3 = 9.5

So, the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase on the salad ingredients for the potluck is $9.5.</s>","Leila spends 3 x $2 = $<<3*2=6>>6.

To find the total number of fruits George has, we need to find the number of pears and add it to the number of bananas.

Number of pears = 1.45 * Number of bananas
Number of pears = 1.45 * 200
Number of pears = 290

Therefore, the total number of fruits George has is:

Step 1: Find the number of kilograms of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.
We're given that Sam needs 5kg of oranges to make 1 liter of juice. So, to make 4 liters, he'll need:
5kg/L * 4L

Step 2: Find the amount of kilograms of oranges needed to make 4 liters of juice

Step 3: Calculate the cost of 15 kg of oranges
5 kg -> 1 L -> 1 liter costs 5kg of oranges
15 kg -> How many liters? -> 3 L/kg -> 5 kg/L -> 15 kg -> 3 liters
Since 1 liter costs $3, we might initially think that 3 liters would cost 3 * $3 = $9. However, the initial weight measurement was given in kilograms. As a reminder, 1kg = 1000g = 1000ml = 1000L. Therefore:

Step 4: Calculate the cost of 15kg of oranges
15 kg * $3/kg = $45

Step 5: Verify

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the number of books Ahmed read in an hour as x.

Step 2: According to the problem, Ezra reads twice as many books as Ahmed in an hour, so Ezra reads x * 2 books in an hour.

Step 3: In the first hour, Ezra reads x * 2 books and then he decides to read an additional 150 books. So the total number of books Ezra reads is (x * 2) + 150.

Step 4: Since x is the number of books Ahmed reads in an hour, we know that Ezra reads twice as many as Ahmed, so x * 2 = 2 * x. Solving this equation for x, we find that x = 150.

Step 5: Substituting x = 150 back into our expression for the total number of books Ezra reads, we have (150 * 2) + 150 = 300 + 150 = 450.

Step 6: Since we don't know how many books Ahmed reads in an hour, we can't find the total number of books they both read altogether.

- On Monday, Tanya taught for 5 hours, so her earnings for these hours are $15/hour * 5 hours = $75.
- On Wednesday, Tanya taught for 2 hours, so her earnings for these hours are $15/hour * 2 hours = $30.

Step 2: Calculate the additional earnings for the classes Tanya taught on Monday.
The problem states that Tanya earns an additional $5 per day for each class beyond three. Since Monday was a day where Tanya taught more than three classes (she taught 4 classes), we need to calculate the earnings for the extra classes.

Let's denote the number of extra classes as 'x'. Since Tanya taught 4 classes in total on Monday and the first three classes do not contribute to the additional earnings, x = 1.
The additional earnings for one extra class are $5/day, and since Monday had two teaching sessions, earning an additional $5/day for each session, the total additional earnings for Monday are $5/class * x * 2 sessions = $5 * 1 * 2 = $10.

Step 3: Calculate Tanya's total earnings for Monday and Wednesday.
Total earnings for Monday = $75 + $10 = $85.
Total earnings for Wednesday = $30.

The final answer is: Tanya earned a total of $85 for teaching on Monday and Wednesday.</s>","Tanya worked for 5 hours + 2 hours = <<5+2=7>>7 hours.

                 [/INST] First, let's identify the variables in the problem:
- Bennet is a farmer of a certain type of crop (eggplants) and corn.
- The price Bennet gets for each eggplant is $3.
- Bennet sells 20 eggplants.
- Bennet has 25 ears of corn.
- Bennet wants to make a total of $135 by selling both eggplants and corn.

Next, we need to figure out how much money Bennet makes from selling eggplants, and then use that amount to determine how much he needs to make from selling corn.

1. The revenue Bennet gets from selling eggplants is $3/eggplant * 20 eggplants = $<<3*20=60>>60.
2. To find the revenue from selling corn, we need to find the difference between the total target revenue and the revenue from selling eggplants: $135 - $60 = $<<135-60=75>>75.
3. Finally, to find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the revenue needed from selling corn by the number of ears of corn: $75 / 25 ears of corn = $<<75/25=3>>3/ear of corn.

{The final answer is: Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.}

However, we made an error in our calculation. The final answer is not $3/ear of corn, but $3/eggplant. Apologies for the confusion. The correct answer is:

{The final answer is: Bennet should sell each eggplant for $3 and each ear of corn for $<<135/20-60/25=1.76>>1.76 (rounded), but since we cannot sell eggs for such a low price per unit, the problem might have a mistake or be inconsistent.}</s>","From his eggplants, Bennet makes 20 * $3 = $<<20*3=60>>60

Total hours = Saturday hours + Sunday hours
Total hours = 7 hours + 5 hours = 12 hours

Step 2: Find the number of hours Tatiana spends on reading and video games.
Reading hours = 3 hours
Video games hours = Remaining hours * (1/3)
Video games hours = (Total hours - Reading hours - Soccer hours) * (1/3)

Step 3: Find the number of hours Tatiana spends playing soccer.
Soccer hours = Total hours - Reading hours - Video games hours
Soccer hours = 12 hours - 3 hours - (Total hours - Reading hours - Soccer hours) * (1/3)

To find the value of Soccer hours, we need to solve this equation for Soccer hours. This equation is a quadratic equation and cannot be solved directly. However, we can make an educated guess based on the given information.

Since Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which is a total of 12 hours, and she spends 3 hours on reading and 1/3 of the remaining time on video games, we can assume that the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer is approximately 2/3 (2 hours on Saturday and 3 hours on Sunday).

3. After giving pencils to Brandon, Anthony had 50 - 25 = 25 pencils remaining.
4. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. So, he gave away 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils to Charlie.
5. Therefore, Anthony kept 25 - 15 = {The final answer is: 10 pencils}.</s>","Brandon received 50 x 1/2 = <<50*1/2=25>>25 pencils

1. Jack drives to the museum, which is 150 miles away from his home.
2. He drives at a speed of 75 miles per hour (mph).
3. To find out how long it takes Jack to drive to the museum, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed
4. Time taken to reach museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours
5. Since Jack also drives back home after visiting the museum, we need to add the time taken for the return journey.
6. Time taken for the return journey is also 2 hours (same distance and speed).
7. Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.
8. To find out how long Jack is gone from his home, we need to add the time spent traveling and the time spent at the museum:
9. Total time gone = Time taken to reach museum + Time spent at museum + Time taken to return home
10. Total time gone = 2 hours (to museum) + 6 hours (at museum) + 2 hours (return journey) = 10 hours

Henry has 57 cars. Each car requires 4 wheels, so the number of wheels needed for cars is: 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 cars * 4 = 912 wheels.

Step 2: Calculate the number of wheels needed for motorcycles.
Henry has 73 motorcycles. Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels, so the number of wheels needed for motorcycles is: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 motorcycles * 2 = 292 wheels.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of wheels Henry needs.
Total number of wheels needed = Wheels for cars + Wheels for motorcycles = 912 wheels + 292 wheels = 1164 wheels.

Step 4: Subtract the number of wheels Henry has from the total number of wheels needed.
The difference between the number of wheels Henry has and the number of wheels he needs is: 650 wheels (in the box) - 1164 wheels (needed for toys) = -514 wheels.

                 [/INST] To find out how much you have to pay with a 20% discount on a $1000 laptop, follow these steps:

1. Understand the problem: The price of a laptop is $1000, and a discount of 20% is applied to this price.

2. Calculate the amount of the discount: Discount = Price of the item * Percentage of discount
Discount = $1000 * 0.2
Discount = $200

3. Subtract the discount from the original price: Final price = Original price - Discount
Final price = $1000 - $200
Final price = $800

{The final answer is: With a 20% discount, you have to pay $800 for the laptop.}</s>","You will get a discount of 20/100 x $1000 = $<<20/100*1000=200>>200.
Therefore, you will have to pay $1000 - $200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of movies that are in series. A third of Mike's movie collection consists of series. So, the number of movies in series is 600 (total movies) x (1/3) = 200.

Step 2: Determine the cost of buying series. Mike knows that he can get these movies for $6 less than the cost of a normal movie. So, the cost of a single movie in a series is $10 - $6 = $4. Since there are 200 movies in series, the total cost to buy all the series would be $200 x $4 = $800.

Step 3: Determine the number of older movies. Forty percent of the remaining movies are older movies. So, the number of older movies is 600 (total movies) - 200 (movies in series) x 0.4 = 240.

Step 4: Determine the cost of older movies. Each older movie costs $5. So, the total cost to buy all the older movies would be $240 x $5 = $1200.

Step 5: Determine the total cost of replacing all the movies. There are 200 movies in series and the cost of buying all the series is $800. There are 240 older movies and the cost of buying all the older movies is $1200. The total cost to replace all the movies is $800 (for movies in series) + $1200 (for older movies) = $<<800+1200=2000>>2000.

                 [/INST] To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit he picked and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the peaches:
Cost of peaches = Pounds of peaches * Price per pound
Cost of peaches = 6 pounds * $2.00/pound
Cost of peaches = $12.00

Next, let's find the cost of the plums:
Cost of plums = Pounds of plums * Price per pound
Cost of plums = 8 pounds * $1.00/pound
Cost of plums = $8.00

Lastly, let's find the cost of the apricots:
Cost of apricots = Pounds of apricots * Price per pound
Cost of apricots = 6 pounds * $3.00/pound
Cost of apricots = $18.00

Now, we can add the cost of each type of fruit to find the total amount Winston spent on fruit:
Total cost of fruit = Cost of peaches + Cost of plums + Cost of apricots
Total cost of fruit = $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00
Total cost of fruit = $32.00

{The final answer is: Winston spent $32.00 on fruit.}</s>","He bought 6 pounds of peaches that are $2.00 per pound so he spent 6*2 = $<<6*2=12.00>>12.00 on peaches
He bought 8 pounds of plums that are $1.00 per pound so he spent 8*1 = $<<8*1=8.00>>8.00 on plums
He bought 6 pounds of apricots that are $3.00 per pound so he spent 6*3 = $<<6*3=18.00>>18.00 on apricots
That day, he spent 12+8+18 = $<<12+8+18=38.00>>38.00 on fruit

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, let's find out how long they spent driving and hiking in total. We know they spent 6 hours in total, so:
   6 hours total = 4 hours driving + x hours hiking

2. We know they drove for 4 hours with an average speed of 50 miles per hour. So, the distance they covered while driving is:
   4 hours driving * 50 miles per hour = 200 miles

3. Let D be the total distance to their vacation spot which includes both driving and hiking. We know D = 200 miles (driving) + x miles (hiking).

4. They hiked for x hours and had an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half of their driving speed. So, we can calculate their hiking speed as:
   5 miles per hour < 50 miles per hour / 2

5. Solving the inequality, we can find that they hike at an average speed of 25 miles per hour.

6. Now, we can calculate the distance they covered while hiking. Since we know their hiking speed is 25 miles per hour and they hiked for x hours, we can find the distance they covered while hiking is:
   x hours hiking * 25 miles per hour = 25x miles

7. Going back to the equation D = 200 miles + 25x miles, we can solve for D:
   D = 200 miles + 25x miles

8. To find the value of x, we need more information, but we can find the value of D using the information given.

9. The final answer depends on the value of x, which represents the time they spent hiking in hours. To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need the value of x first.

Therefore, the final answer cannot be given without the additional information.

{The final answer is not provided in this problem as we are missing the value of x}.</s>","Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.
Hence, their average speed hiking was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour.
So, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.
It took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.
So, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.
Therefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Both Ava and Emma will earn points based on the number of enemies they jump on, the number of berries they collect, and the time left on the timer when they finish the level.
2. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she will get 8 * 10 = 80 points from this.
3. Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so she will get 3 * 5 = 15 points from this.
4. The difference in the number of points earned from enemies and berries is 80 + 15 - (Emma's points from enemies) - (Emma's points from berries).
5. Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. To calculate her points from the timer, we need to find out how many seconds Emma finished in and subtract 4 from it. Let's say Emma finished the level in S seconds, then Ava finished it in S + 4 seconds.
6. Ava earns 30 points for every second Emma finishes earlier, so she earns 30 * 4 = 120 points from the timer.
7. The total score for Ava is 80 + 15 + 120 = 215 points.
8. We don't have information about Emma's points from enemies and berries, but we can calculate her points from the timer: 30 * S points.
9. The difference between their scores is 215 - 30*S points.

{The final answer is: The difference between their scores is 215 - 30*S points, where S is the number of seconds Emma finished the level in.}</s>","For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.
For collecting berries, Emma earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 fewer points than Ava.

1. Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. So, in 5 days they ride their bikes: 3 (times per day) × 5 (days) = 15 (times)
2. They ride their bikes twice the times they do on usual days on 2 other days. This means they ride their bikes 3 times their usual daily rides on those days. Let's call their usual daily rides ""x"":
   - On these 2 days, they ride their bikes 3 × times their usual daily rides = 3x
3. First, we find their total number of daily rides: 15 (times on 5 usual days) + 3x (times on 2 non-usual days)
4. The problem asks for the total number of rides they do in a week (7 days): 15 + 3x = rides per week

Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide enough information to find the value of ""x"" directly, so we cannot determine a specific final answer. However, we can express the final answer in terms of the variable ""x"":

The final answer is: rides per week = 15 + 3x.

Note: To find the exact number of rides per week, we would need to know the value of ""x"" (Chase and Rider's usual daily rides).</s>","Each person rides his bike 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 times for 5 days.

After Bob bought some more fish, the number of white fish became 2x and the number of orange fish became 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6.

We know that the total number of fish Bob has is x + 3 + 17 = x + 20, and the total number of white and orange fish is 2x + 6 + x = 3x + 6.

We also know that the number of white fish is now twice the number of orange fish, so x = (1/2)(3x + 6).

Solving for x, we get x = 2. Solving for the number of white fish Bob bought, we get x + 3 + 17 = 3x + 6 + x, which simplifies to x = 7. So Bob bought 7 white fish.

2. Now, to find out how many gallons of gas Andy uses per day, we can use his car's fuel efficiency: 10 miles / 10 mpg = 1 gallon/day.
3. To calculate the weekly fuel usage, we need to multiply the daily usage by the number of days in a week: 1 gallon/day * 5 days/week = 5 gallons/week.

                    question:
                    ! Samwell owns an appliances : store. For this week, ? one-fourth : of ; their ; sales are smart TVs, one-eighth are analog ! TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. If they were able to ? sell a total of 40 TVs, how ! many OLED TVs ; were ; they able ? to ? sell?
                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many TVs of each type were sold based on the given fractions.

1. One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs: This means that 1/4 * Total sales = Number of smart TVs
2. One-eighth are analog TVs: This means that 1/8 * Total sales = Number of analog TVs

We know that one-half of the sales are OLED TVs since the remaining fraction is ""the rest"" which can be represented as 1/2. Therefore, 1/2 * Total sales = Number of OLED TVs

Given that the total number of TVs sold is 40, we can set up the following system of equations:

1. x = Number of smart TVs
2. y = Number of analog TVs
3. z = Number of OLED TVs

We're given: x = 1/4 * Total sales
y = 1/8 * Total sales
z = 1/2 * Total sales
x + y + z = Total sales

Given that Total sales = 40:

x = 1/4 * 40 = 10
y = 1/8 * 40 = 5

So far, we have sold 10 smart TVs and 5 analog TVs, which leaves us with:

z = Total sales - (x + y) = 40 - (10 + 5) = 25 OLED TVs

{The final answer is: They were able to sell 25 OLED TVs.}</s>","Samwell was able to sell 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 Smart TVs.
He was able to sell 1/8 x 40 = <<1/8*40=5>>5 analog TVs.
So, he was able to sell 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 Analog and Smart TVs.
Therefore, the total number of OLED TVs that he was able to sell is 40 - 15 = <<40-15=25>>25.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the given information.
- John is raising money for a school trip.
- He has applied for help from the school.
- The school has decided to cover half the cost of the trip.

Step 2: Determine the amount of money the school is contributing.
- Half of the cost of the trip is being covered by the school.
- Let the total cost of the trip be ""x"".
- So, the school's contribution is (1/2)x.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money John still needs to raise.
- John's personal contribution to the trip is the difference between the total cost and the school's contribution.
- John's contribution = (Total cost) - (School's contribution)
- John's contribution = x - (1/2)x
- John's contribution = (1/2)x
- Since we know the school has covered half the cost and the remaining amount John needs to raise is $50, we have:
- (1/2)x = $50
- Solving for x:
- x = 2 * $50
- x = $100

Step 4: Determine the missing amount.
- We know the total cost of the trip is $300.
- We've calculated that the school is contributing $100 and John needs to raise another $50.
- The missing amount is the difference between the total cost and the school's contribution and John's contribution.
- Missing amount = Total cost - (School's contribution + John's contribution)
- Missing amount = $300 - ($100 + $50)
- Missing amount = $300 - $150
- Missing amount = $150

{The final answer is: John is missing $150 to fully fund the school trip.}</s>","John's school has decided to pay 300 / 2 = $<<300/2=150>>150 for his trip.
In total John has covered 150 + 50 = $<<150+50=200>>200 for his trip
Therefore, John needs 300 - 200 = $<<300-200=100>>100 more for the trip.

                 [/INST] Step 1: The temperature difference between day and night is 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees. Therefore, the temperature inside the house during the night is 45 degrees - 12 degrees = 33 degrees.

Step 2: To prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature inside the house must be above 32 degrees. So, the house must be heated up by at least 1 degree (32 degrees - 31 degrees) to avoid freezing.

Step 3: Each log of wood heats up the house by 5 degrees. Therefore, Carson needs to burn one log to heat up the house by 1 degree (1 degree × 5 degrees/log = 1/5 logs).

Step 4: To maintain the house temperature at 34 degrees (33 degrees + 1 degree), Carson needs to burn logs that constantly add 1 degree of heat. So, Carson needs to burn logs at a rate of 1 degree/hour.

Step 5: The temperature difference between the house temperature and the outside temperature during the night is 34 degrees - 33 degrees = 1 degree. Since each log adds 5 degrees of heat, Carson needs to burn one log every hour to avoid freezing (1 degree/hour ÷ 5 degrees/log = 1/5 logs/hour).

Step 6: During an hour, the temperature outside will drop by 1 degree, so Carson needs to burn an additional log every hour to maintain the house temperature at 34 degrees.

Step 7: Therefore, Carson needs to burn 1 log per hour × 24 hours = 24 logs in a day to prevent the pipes from freezing.

{The final answer is 24 logs}</s>","First find the night-time temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees
Then find how much Carson needs to heat his house to avoid the pipes freezing: 32 degrees - 12 degrees = <<32-12=20>>20 degrees
Then divide the amount of heat Carson needs by the amount of heat each log produces: 20 degrees / 5 degrees/log = <<20/5=4>>4 logs

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of groups formed.
Since 90 people were required to be split into 9-person groups, we first need to find out how many groups can be formed with 9 people in each group:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Step 2: Determine the number of group members bringing back seashells.
We know that 3/5 of the number of groups had a certain number of group members bringing back 2 seashells each. So, let's figure out how many people that is for one group and then multiply that number by the total number of group members bringing the seashells back:

1. Find the number of group members bringing back seashells per group:
   Group members bringing seashells = Total group members * (3/5)
   Group members bringing seashells = 9 * (3/5)

   Simplifying the fraction: 3/5 = 1.8, so 1.8 * 9 = 16.2. Since we cannot have a fractional number of people, we need to round down to the nearest whole number: 16 group members will be bringing back seashells for each group.

2. Find the total number of group members bringing back seashells:
   Total group members bringing seashells = Number of groups * Group members bringing seashells per group
   Total group members bringing seashells = 10 * 16

Step 3: Find the total number of seashells brought back.
We know that each of the 16 group members bringing back seashells brought back 2 seashells, so we can find the total number of seashells brought back by multiplying the number of group members bringing back seashells by the number of seashells each of them brought:

Total number of seashells = Total group members bringing seashells * Number of seashells per member
Total number of seashells = 10 * 16 * 2

So, {The final answer is 2880 seashells}.</s>","Since the total number of people at the competition was 90, they formed 90/9=<<90/9=10>>10 groups after splitting into 9-person groups.
If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bringing back 2 seashells each, then 3/5*10=<<3/5*10=6>>6 groups had members bringing back 2 seashells.
Since each group had 9 people, the number of people in the 6 groups, who found 2 seashells each, was 6*9= <<6*9=54>>54.
The total number of seashells the 54 people brought is 54*2=<<54*2=108>>108 seashells.

Step 3: Find out how much each bottle cap is worth.
The problem states that ""each bottle cap is worth $0.25.""

Step 4: Determine how many bottle caps Damien has in a month.
Since the problem asks for the amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, and we know Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day, we can calculate how many bottle caps Damien has in a month by multiplying the number of bottle caps he finds daily by the number of days in a month: 10 bottle caps/day * 30 days/month = 300 bottle caps/month.

Step 5: Calculate how much money Damien makes in a month.
Since each bottle cap is worth $0.25, we can calculate how much money Damien makes by multiplying the number of bottle caps he has in a month by the value of each bottle cap: 300 bottle caps * $0.25/bottle cap = $75.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of hours Billy works as x, and his current hourly wage as H.

1. We know that Billy's hourly wage was $10 when he started working.
2. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his hourly wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his current hourly wage $11.50 per hour.
4. We're given that Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting wage, so Sally's starting hourly wage is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00 per hour.
5. Both Billy and Sally work for 20 hours per week, so we can calculate their weekly wages and compare them to find the difference.
6. Billy's weekly wage is $11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230.
7. Sally's weekly wage is $11.00 per hour * 20 hours = $220.
8. To find the difference between Billy's and Sally's weekly wages, subtract Sally's weekly wage from Billy's weekly wage: $230 - $220 = $10.
9. Therefore, Billy earns $10 more per week than Sally.

The final answer is: Billy earns $10 more per week than Sally.</s>","Billy has a salary of $10+0.50+$1.00=$<<10+0.5+1=11.50>>11.50 per hour.
Sally is paid $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, for a total of $10+$0.50=$<<10+0.5=10.50>>10.50 per hour.
If Billy works 20 hours, he will be paid 20*$11.50=$<<20*11.5=230>>230
If Sally works 20 hours, she will be paid 20*$10.50=$<<20*10.50=210>>210.
Thus, if both work 20 hours, Billy will be paid $230-$210=$20 more.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 2 bagels.
Cost of each bagel = $1
Number of bagels = 2
Total cost of 2 bagels = Cost of 1 bagel * Number of bagels
Total cost of 2 bagels = $1 * 2 = $2

Step 2: Calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread.
Cost of each loaf of bread = $2
Number of loaves = 3
Total cost of 3 loaves of bread = Cost of 1 loaf of bread * Number of loaves
Total cost of 3 loaves of bread = $2 * 3 = $6

 Step 3: Let's calculate Nikita's points:

Nikita's points = 278 / 2 - 11
Nikita's points = 139.5 - 11
Nikita's points = 128.5

Step 4: Since we cannot have half a point in bowling, we need to round down Nikita's points to 128.

Step 5: Now, let's find the total points for both Pierson and Nikita.

Total points = Pierson's points + Nikita's points
Total points = 278 + 128

1. There are 40 classes, each with an average of 25 students. So in total, there are:
   Number of students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

2. Each student plants one tree, so:
   Trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

3. Each class has 3 teachers. So, in total, there are:
   Number of teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

4. Each teacher plants two trees, so:
   Trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees/class * 40 classes = 960 trees

5. To find the total number of trees planted, add the trees planted by students and teachers:

Step 2: Calculate the number of stuffed goats needed such that 30% of the total number of stuffed animals are goats.
Number of stuffed goats = Total number of stuffed animals * 0.3
Number of stuffed goats = ¹⁴ * 0.3 = ₄⁴

Step 3: Since we cannot buy a fraction of a stuffed goat, Bubbles needs to buy an integer number of goats such that the number of goats is greater than or equal to the calculated number, ₄⁴.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of hours Kris plays in a week when she plays for half an hour every day:
0.5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 3.5 hours/week

Step 2: Calculate the number of hours Kris plays in a week when she plays for 2 hours every day:
2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks Kris needs to play for half an hour every day to reach 30 hours:
30 hours / 3.5 hours/week = 8.57 weeks ≈ 9 weeks (since we can't have a fraction of a week)

Step 4: Calculate the number of hours Kris needs to play during these 9 weeks playing for half an hour every day:
9 weeks * 3.5 hours/week = 31.5 hours

Step 5: Subtract the number of hours Kris has already played to find out how many more hours she needs:
30 hours (from the question) - 31.5 hours = -1.5 hours

Since Kris can't play fewer than half an hour at a time, she cannot have negative hours, so her calculation was incorrect. To earn the achievement, she would need to play more than what she has already played, and it appears that more calculation is needed to determine an accurate answer.

Unfortunately, the information given in the question may not be sufficient for determining the exact number of hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement. Additional information about the weekly schedule or the hourly rate at which she can earn the achievement would be required.

Therefore, there isn't a final answer for this problem with the given information.</s>","Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.
So playing for half an hour every day means Kris will have played for 0.5 hours * 14 days = <<0.5*14=7>>7 hours.
Playing for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.
She therefore still needs to play 30 – 7 – 14 = <<30-7-14=9>>9 hours.

If both cars continue on the highway at the same ; speed, ; how : many miles will separate them after 2 hours?
                 [/INST] To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we first need to find the distance each car travels in 2 hours, and then find the difference between their final positions.

Let's call the time it takes for the second car to pass the first car ""t"" hours. During this time, the first car travels a distance of 60 miles per hour * t hours = 60t miles.

During the same time, the second car travels a distance of 70 miles per hour * t hours = 70t miles.

At the moment the second car passes the first car, they are no longer touching, so the distance between them is the sum of the distances each car has traveled since they started moving apart: 60t + 70t = 130t.

We're asked to find the distance after 2 hours, so we need to find the value of t that makes 130t = 60 * 2 + 70 * 2 = 180 + 140 = 320.

Dividing both sides by 130, we get t = 320 / 130 = 2.54 hours (approximately).

Now that we know it takes about 2.54 hours for the second car to overtake the first car, we can find the distance between them after 2 hours by calculating the distance each car travels in that time:

First car: 60 miles per hour * 2 hours = 120 miles
Second car: 70 miles per hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the final answer must be the difference in miles between the two cars, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car:

{The final answer is: 140 (second car's position) - 120 (first car's position) = 20 miles}</s>","In two hours, the first car will have traveled 60*2 = <<60*2=120>>120 miles.
Similarly, the second car will have traveled 70*2 = <<70*2=140>>140 miles.
Thus, the cars are separated by 140 - 120 = <<140-120=20>>20 miles after two hours.

Total cost before premium = $900

Step 2: James pays a 30% premium for the ring to be made. The premium amount can be calculated as:

Premium amount = Total cost before premium * Premium percentage
Premium amount = $900 * 0.3
Premium amount = $2700

Step 3: The total cost of the ring, including the premium, is the sum of the total cost before premium and the premium amount:

square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch
square inches = 12 square inches

Step 6: Determine the length of Milo's mosaic based on its height and the area it can cover.
Length (in inches) = Area (in square inches) / Height (in inches)

4. Now, we know that there are 10 quarts of tea left, so the total amount of tea at the party must have been: 10 quarts (left) + 38 quarts (consumed) = 48 quarts.
5. Finally, let's convert 48 quarts to gallons: 1 gallon = 4 quarts, so 48 quarts = 12 gallons.

{The final answer is: There were 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party.}</s>","4 students drank 1.5 quarts = 4 * 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6 quarts
16 students drank 2 quarts = 16 * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 quarts

Step 3: Dale then ordered an additional 100 candies.

So far, Dale has sold 100 candies from his initial order and now has 150 candies in total (from both orders). To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell to get rid of all of his candies, we need to calculate the total number of candies he now has and compare it to the number of candies he eventually wants to sell.

Step 4: Dale now has a total of 100 (initially ordered) + 150 (later ordered) = 250 candies.

1. We know that the number of students doubles every month at the end of the month. Let's find out how many students are on campus after one month (May): Students at the end of May = Students at the beginning of April * 2 = 10 * 2 = 20.

2. Now we need to find out how many students are on campus at the end of each month up to May. We can use the same doubling formula:
   - April: Students at the end of April = Students at the beginning of April * 2 = 10 * 2 = 20.
   - May: Students at the end of May = Students at the beginning of May * 2 = 20 * 2 = 40.

So, there are 40 students on campus at the end of May.

3. To find the number of additional students above and beyond the number of students at the beginning of the year, we subtract the number of students at the beginning of the year from the number of students at the end of May: Additional students = Students at the end of May - Students at the beginning of the year = 40 - 10 = 30.

1. We know that Felix made $105 in a week. Let's assume he worked 7 days in a week.
2. We are given that he pays $0.25 for every branch he has to climb.
3. So, the total number of branches he climbed during the week is:

Total branches = Total earnings / Earnings per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

4. To find the average number of branches he climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches he climbed in a week by the number of days he worked.

Average branches per day = Total branches / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day ≈ 60

                 [/INST] To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to first calculate the number of petals on each type of flower that Rose picked and then subtract the petals lost due to dropping and wind.

1. Initially, Rose picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals.
2. Then she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals.
3. After that, she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals.
4. Lastly, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals.
5. In total, Rose picked 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 81 petals.

Now, let's calculate how many petals were lost due to dropping and wind:
1. Rose dropped one flower of each type: 1 (from 5-petals) + 1 (from 6-petals) + 1 (from 4-petals) + 1 (from 7-petals) = 4 petals.

Therefore, the total number of petals in the vase is:
81 (petals initially picked) - 4 (lost petals) = {77} petals.

So, The final answer is 77 petals.</s>","Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.
Finally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.
Rose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.
But the wind blows 5+6+4+7=<<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals worth of flowers away.
So Rose has 101-22=<<101-22=79>>79 petals worth remaining

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of marshmallows John and DeSean used to make S'mores.
John made 9 S'mores, so John used 9 * 1 = 9 marshmallows.
DeSean made 9 S'mores, so DeSean used 9 * 1 = 9 marshmallows.
They dropped 3 marshmallows, so those are not used.
So, in total, they used 9 (John's marshmallows) + 9 (DeSean's marshmallows) + 9 (total for both, but this counts the dropped marshmallows twice) - 3 (marshmallows dropped) = 17 marshmallows.

Step 2: Determine how many marshmallows are left in the bag.
The bag contains 35 marshmallows initially, 17 have been used for making S'mores, so the remaining marshmallows are 35 - 17 = 18 marshmallows.

Step 3: Determine how many S'mores each kid can make with the remaining marshmallows.
John and DeSean can each make 1 S'more with one marshmallow, so:
Marshmallows remaining = 18
S'mores each = ?
S'mores each = Marshmallows remaining / Marshmallows per S'more
S'mores each = 18 / 1
S'mores each = 18

So each kid can make 18 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows. {The final answer is each kid can make 18 S'mores}.</s>","They used up 21 marshmallows because 9 plus 9 plus 3 equals <<9+9+3=21>>21.

                 [/INST] Let's first determine how long each friend plays for, and then calculate the number of quarters they need based on their playing times.

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
2. Two friends are worse and can play for half the time Jack can. So each worst friend can play for 10 minutes.
3. One friend is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times longer than Jack. So this friend can play for 30 minutes (1.5 * 20 minutes).

Now let's find out how many quarters each friend needs to play for the given duration:

1. Jack plays for 4 hours, which is equal to 240 minutes (4 hours * 60 minutes/hour).
2. Jack pays with 1 quarter every 20 minutes. So, the number of quarters Jack needs is: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
3. Two worse friends play for a total of 2 x 10 minutes = 20 minutes. They need 2 quarters each for their playing time since they pay every 10 minutes.
4. One better friend plays for a total of 30 minutes. He pays every 15 minutes, so he uses: 30 minutes / 15 minutes/quarter = 2 quarters.

The final answer is: Jack uses 12 quarters, and each of his two worse friends pays for 2 quarters, making a total of 16 quarters used.</s>","Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Tanya makes enough material to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. Let's find out the amount of each ingredient by setting up ratios for the ones given.

Step 2: The same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar:
- Let x be the amount of citrus zest and fragrance in ounces.
- Let y be the amount of salt and sugar in ounces.

From the problem, we have:
x = y

Step 3: The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest and the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt:
y = 2x
o = 2y

Step 4: Substitute x with its equivalent in terms of y from the first equation and then substitute y with its equivalent in terms of x from the second equation:

x = y
y = 2x

o = 2(2x)

Step 5: Simplify and solve for oil (o):
o = 4x

Step 6: Since the amount of ingredients in the jar is constant, we can find the amount of oil needed to fill a 10-ounce jar:

x + y + o = 10
x + y + 4x = 10
5x + y = 10

Step 7: Substitute x in terms of y from the first equation (x = y) and solve for y:

5(y) + y = 10
6y = 10
y = \frac{10}{6} ≈ 1.67 ounces

Step 8: To find x, we go back to x = y:
x ≈ 1.67 ounces

Step 9: Finally, we have the amount of oil needed:
o = 4x ≈ 4 * 1.67 = 6.68 ounces

{The final answer is approximately 6.68 ounces of oil.}</s>","Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.
Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.
She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.
In all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.
Thus, she uses Z = 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1 ounce of zest.

Step 4: After selling and giving away some cars, Joe is left with 2X - 0.4X - 0.8X = 1.2X cars.

Step 5: The problem states that ""Robert has NOT 20 cars, but 20 less than that"". Let's find out what that means: X = 20 - 20 = 0. So, X is actually a negative number, but the question seems to be incorrect as it cannot represent the number of cars Robert has in a realistic sense.

The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000. We know that $50,000 came from organizations, so the remaining amount raised by the students is:
$175,000 (total) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000

Step 2: Divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.
$125,000 (amount raised by students) / 20 students = $6,250 per student

The final answer is: Each student raised $6,250.</s>","Amount raised by all students was 175,000-50,000 = <<175000-50000=125000>>125,000 dollars.

Calculate , the total ! time Sandy took ; to walk ! in . the two days in minutes.
                 [/INST] To find the total time Sandy took to walk in two days, we first need to find out how many hours she walked on each day. We are given that she walked for 8 hours on the first day and half as many hours on the second day as on the first day.

Let's denote the number of hours she walked on the second day as x. Then, using the given information, we can write the equations:

Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day => First day hours = 8
Sandy walked for half as many hours on the second day as on the first day => Second day hours = 8 / 2 = 4

Next, we need to find the total number of hours Sandy walked in two days. We have:

Total hours = Hours on first day + Hours on second day = 8 + 4 = 12

Now we need to convert the total hours from days to minutes. We know that:
1 hour = 60 minutes
12 hours = 12 x 60 = 720 minutes

{The final answer is 720 minutes}.</s>","If she walked half as many hours on the second day as the first day, she walked for 1/2*8 = <<8*1/2=4>>4 hours on the second day.
The total time Sandy walked in the two days is 8+4 =<<8+4=12>>12 hours.
Since 1 hour has 60 minutes, Sandy walked for 12*60 = <<12*60=720>>720 minutes in the two days.

1. John does 30 cycles of work a day.
2. Each cycle contains 5 different tasks.
3. Each task pays $1.20.
4. He works a full 7-day week.

First, let's find out how much John makes in one day.

Amount per day = Cycles per day * (Tasks per cycle * Payment per task)
= 30 cycles * (5 tasks * $1.20/task)
= 30 cycles * $6
= $180

Now, to find out how much John makes in a week, we need to multiply the amount he makes in a day by the number of days in a week.

Amount per week = Amount per day * Days per week
= $180/day * 7 days/week
= $1260/week

Therefore, {The final answer is: John makes $1260 per week}.</s>","Each cycle pays 5*$1.2=$<<5*1.2=6>>6

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

Step 1: Define the variables
Let x be the number of Magic Cards that PJ has.
Let y be the number of Magic Cards that Smendrick has.
Let z be the number of Magic Cards that Becca has.

Step 2: Set up the equations
1. Becca has x + 12 more cards than Smendrick: z = y + 12
2. Smendrick has 3 times the number of Magic Cards that PJ has: y = 3x

Step 3: Find the relationship between Becca and PJ
Since y = 3x and z = y + 12, we can substitute y with 3x in the equation for z:
z = 3x + 12

Step 4: Use the total number of cards to find the value of x
There are a total of 341 cards, so x + y + z = 341
Substitute y with 3x from the second equation, and simplify:
x + 3x + z = 341
4x + z = 341

Step 5: Find the value of z in terms of x
From the equation for z (z = 3x + 12), we know that z is a function of x. To find z, we need to solve for x first.

Step 6: Solve for x
We have z = 3x + 12 and 4x + z = 341. Since z is a function of x, we can replace z in the second equation with 3x + 12:
4x + (3x + 12) = 341

Step 7: Solve the equation for x
Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341
Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 339
Divide both sides by 7:
x = 484/7 ≈ 69.14
Since it's not possible to have a fractional number of Magic Cards, there's an error in the problem statement or we're missing some important information.

{The final answer is not provided because there's an inconsistency in the problem.}</s>","Let x represent the number of cards PJ has

The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound. So, the weight-related shipping cost would be 4 pounds × $0.35/pound = $1.40.

Step 2: Calculate the shipping cost based on distance.
The distribution center is 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile. So, the distance-related shipping cost would be 20 miles × $0.08/mile = $1.60.

Step 3: Determine the refund amount from Amazon.
Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32. So, the refund amount would be $32 × 0.75 = $24.60.

Step 4: Calculate Milly's total loss.
Milly's total loss would be the shipping costs (weight and distance) minus the refund amount. Total loss = $1.40 (weight-related) + $1.60 (distance-related) - $24.60 (refund) = -$22.20.

Step 2: Next, we need to find out how much Mulan spent on the two pairs of jeans and the bag. She bought two pairs of jeans priced at $30 each, so she spent:
Money spent on jeans = 2 * $30
Money spent on jeans = $60
She also bought a bag for $20.
Total money spent = $60 + $20
Total money spent = $80

Step 3: To find out how much money Mulan has left, we subtract the total money spent from the total money she had.
Money left = Total money - Money spent
Money left = $140 - $80
Money left = $60

1. The base installation price is $129.00 for hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.
2. The cost for installing additional items is an extra $15.00 per item.
3. Angela needs to have 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed.
4. The cost for Mirrors: 6 mirrors * $129.00/4 mirrors = $322.50 (Since the price is per 4 mirrors)
5. The cost for Chandeliers: 2 chandeliers * $129.00/1 chandelier = $258.00

                 [/INST] Let's assume that the total amount of money earned by Roy, Anthony, and Eva is X. We can set up equations based on the given information.

Let R be the amount of money Roy has saved, A be the amount of money Anthony has saved, and E be the amount of money Eva has saved.

From the problem, we know:

1. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony: R = 1.4 * A
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva: A = E + $10
3. Eva has saved $20.00

Substituting the value of A from the second equation into the first equation:

R = 1.4 *(E + $10)

Now we have one equation with three variables. Since we know that Eva has saved $20.00, we can find the value of one variable, and then use that value to find the other variables.

From the third equation, we know that Eva has saved $20.00, so:

E = $20

Now we can find the value of A:

A = E + $10 = $20 + $10 = $30

Finally, we can find the value of R:

R = 1.4 * A = 1.4 * $30 = $42

So, Roy has saved $42 in total. {The final answer is $42}.</s>","Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva who has $20.00 so he has 10+20 = $<<10+20=30.00>>30.00

1. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 12 * 4 = 48 times higher than Pompei.

2. Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 12 * 4 * 10 = 480 times higher than Pompei.

3. If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high, then Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches (or 480 * 12 = 5760 feet) high.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find out how many miles Mason travels during each segment of his journey.
Segment 1: He travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours.
Miles travelled in segment 1 = Speed * Time
Miles travelled in segment 1 = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours
Miles travelled in segment 1 = 32 miles

Segment 2: He takes a break for 2 hours and does not travel any distance during this time.

Segment 3: He goes on for another 6 hours.
Miles travelled in segment 3 = Speed * Time
Miles travelled in segment 3 = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours
Miles travelled in segment 3 = 48 miles

Step 2: To find the total distance travelled by Mason, we add the distances covered during each segment of his journey.
Total distance travelled = Distance in segment 1 + Distance in segment 3
Total distance travelled = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance travelled = 80 miles

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance, we first need to find the speed of each kangaroo and then determine the speed of each turtle.

Step 1: Find the speed of a single kangaroo.
We know that three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel a certain distance. To find their speed, we can use the formula:

speed = distance / time

Let's denote the distance as D.

speed_kangaroo = D / 18

Step 2: Find the speed of a single turtle.
The question states that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. Let's denote the speed of a single turtle as s_turtle.

speed_turtle = speed_kangaroo / 2

Step 3: Find the time it takes for the four turtles to travel the distance.
We can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

time_turtles = D / (speed_turtle * 4)

Substituting the value of speed_turtle from Step 2, we get:

time_turtles = D / (speed_kangaroo / 2 * 4)

Simplifying this expression:

time_turtles = D * (2 / (speed_kangaroo * 4))

Substituting the value of speed_kangaroo from Step 1:

time_turtles = D * (2 / (D / 18 * 4))

Now, we can simplify the equation:

time_turtles = D * (2 / (D * 1 / 6 * 4))

time_turtles = D * (2 / (1/6 * 4 * D))

time_turtles = D * (2 / (1/3 * 4 * D))

time_turtles = D * (6 / 1) / (1 * 12 * D)

time_turtles = 6 / 12

time_turtles = 1/2

So the time taken by four turtles to travel the distance is 1/2 hour or 30 minutes.

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is: It takes 30 minutes for four turtles to travel the same distance as three kangaroos.}</s>","If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed, a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, one kangaroo takes 18/3= <<18/3=6>>6 hours to cross the highway.
A turtle traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo will take 2*6 = <<2*6=12>>12 hours to cross the highway.
Four turtles will take a total of 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 hours to travel across the highway.

Step 2: Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada makes 2 * (x + 20) dishes.

Step 3: To find the total number of dishes they make together, we add the number of dishes made by each person:
Total dishes = Dishes made by Jada + Dishes made by Rory + Dishes made by Kora

Step 4: Substitute the expressions for the number of dishes made by each person into the equation:
Total dishes = 2 * (x + 20) + (x + 20) + x

Step 5: Simplify the equation:
Total dishes = 2x + 40 + x + 20

Step 2: The sales assistant told her that she can get a discount of $200 if she trades in her old laptop. So, the actual cost of the new laptop for Erika would be $600 - $200 = $<<600-200=400>>400.

Step 3: Erika already has some savings in her purse. We don't know the exact amount, but we'll call it 'x'. We also know she got paid $150 this week and her mom agreed to give her an additional $80. So, Erika has: x + $150 + $80 = x + $230

Step 4: We know that Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the new laptop. So, the total amount of money Erika needs to have in her purse to buy the laptop is: $400 (cost of the new laptop) + $50 (extra money needed) = $<<400+50=450>>450.

Step 5: To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to find the value of 'x'. We don't have enough information to do that, so we cannot directly answer the question as stated.

Therefore, we cannot determine the exact amount of money Erika has in her purse without knowing the initial amount of savings she had.
{The final answer is: The given information is not sufficient to find out how much money Erika has in her purse.}</s>","Selling the old laptop reduced the cost of the new laptop to $600 – $200 = $<<600-200=400>>400 dollars.

- One small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Therefore, one small apple yields 3 slices.

Step 2: Determine how many slices Adam makes from the large and small apples he buys.
- Adam buys 3 large apples, so he gets 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 slices from the large apples.
- Adam buys 5 small apples, so he gets 5 * 3 = <<5*3=15>>15 slices from the small apples.

Step 3: Find out how many slices Adam has eaten.
- Adam eats 15 slices, so that number is subtracted from the total number of slices he made.
- Total slices Adam has = 15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = <<15+15=30>>30 slices
- Initial number of slices Adam had = 15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = <<15+15=30>>30 slices
- Number of slices Adam ate = 15 slices

                    While ? on vacation in Bali, . Thea ! bought . a hat from a : craftsman : worth $70. If she gave . the craftsman four ; $20 bills, how much change did she get?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thea is on vacation in Bali.
2. She bought a hat from a craftsman.
3. The cost of the hat is $70.
4. Thea paid the craftsman with four $20 bills.

First, we need to find the total amount Thea paid the craftsman. Since she used four $20 bills, we can find the total by multiplying the number of bills by the value of each bill:
Total amount = Number of $20 bills × Value of each $20 bill
Total amount = 4 × $20
Total amount = $80

Next, we need to find the difference between the total amount Thea paid and the cost of the hat to determine how much change she received:
Change = Total amount – Cost of the hat
Change = $80 – $70
Change = $10

{The final answer is: Thea received $10 in change.}</s>","If she gave the craftsman four $20 bills, the total amount of money she gave to the craftsman is 4*$20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.
Since the hat was worth $70, the craftsman gave her change equal to $80-$70=$10

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of squirt guns.
Craig buys 6 squirt guns, and each gun costs $2. So, the total cost for squirt guns is:
6 * $2 = $12

Step 2: Calculate the cost of water balloons.
Craig buys 3 packs of water balloons, and each pack costs $3. So, the total cost for water balloons is:
3 * $3 = $9

Step 3: Find the total amount Craig has spent.
Craig spends $12 on squirt guns and $9 on water balloons. So, the total amount he spent is:
$12 + $9 = $21

Step 4: Subtract the total spent from the initial amount Craig had.
Craig had 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is equal to $40. So, the amount of money left is:
$40 - $21 = $19

- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.
- Jack has X number of dishes.
- Peter has half that number of dishes as Jack.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store.
- Jack collected 60 dishes.

Step 2: Find the number of socks Peter has.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.
- Jack has X number of dishes.
- Peter has half that number of dishes as Jack.
- So, Peter has half as many dishes as Jack and half as many socks as Jack.
- Therefore, Peter has X/2 socks.

Step 3: Find the number of socks Jack has.
- Jack has X number of dishes.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.
- Peter has X/2 socks.
- So, Jack has X/2 socks.

Step 4: Find the number of dishes Peter has.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack.
- Jack has X number of dishes.
- So, Peter has X/2 dishes.

Step 5: Find the number of dishes Jack has from the information given about the store.
- Jack collected 60 dishes.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store.
- So, the number of socks Jack has is 60/2 = 30.
- Since Jack has 30 socks, he has twice that number of dishes, which is 30*2 = 60 dishes.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together.
- Peter has X/2 socks and X/2 dishes.
- Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes.

There are 20 students in Miss Susan's class. Of these students, 5 are good at math only, 8 are good at English only, and some number are good at both math and English.

step 2: Identify the given information
- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students are good at English only.

step 3: Convert the problem to one of arithmetic
First, let's find out how many students are good at both math and English. The total number of students is the sum of students good at math only, students good at English only, and students good at both:

Total students = Students good at math only + Students good at English only + Students good at both

20 = 5 + 8 + X

Step 4: Solve the equation
To find the number of students good at both math and English (X), we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and students good at English only from the total number of students:

X = 20 - 5 - 8

Step 5: Display the final answer
{The final answer is: There are 7 students good at both math and English}

Thus, if we subtract the number of students good at math only (5) and students good at English only (8), we find that there are 7 students who excel in both subjects.

Therefore, the total number of students who are good at math is 5 (students good at math only) + 7 (students good at both math and English) = 12.

So the answer is: {The final answer is: There are 12 students who are good at math}</s>","The number of students who are good at math includes those who are only good at math and those who are good at both math and English.

If she ? allows a ; 10-minute intermission, how , many groups can perform in the concert?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total time each group spends on stage.
Time on stage = Setup time + Performance time + Teardown time
= 2 minutes + 6 minutes + 2 minutes
= 10 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total duration of the concert without the intermission.
Total concert time without intermission = Number of groups * Time per group
Let x be the number of groups, then x * 10 = Total concert time (in minutes) without intermission

Step 3: Calculate the total duration of the concert with the intermission.
Total concert time with intermission = Total concert time (without intermission) + Intermission time
= x * 10 + 10

Step 4: Determine the length of the intermission in terms of the number of groups.
10-minute intermission = (Number of groups / Group setup time per hour) * 10
Let y be the number of groups per hour, then y * 10 / 60 = 1.66 (approximately)

Step 5: Solve for the number of groups with intermission.
Total concert time with intermission = x * 10 + 10
x * 10 + 10 = (y * 10 / 60) * 60 + 10

To find the exact number of groups, you would need to solve this equation for x. However, you can approximate the answer by assuming rounded numbers for y. For example, if you assume that 30 groups can perform per hour, then you would get:

x * 10 + 10 = 30 * 10 / 60 * 60 + 10
x * 10 + 10 = 25 * 60 + 10
x * 10 + 10 = 1500 + 10
x * 10 = 1510
x ≈ 151

So, approximately 151 groups can perform with a 10-minute intermission.

{The final answer is approximately 151 groups.}</s>","First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
Of those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 – 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances.
Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.
Of the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.

- Brenda invests $300 in a simple interest scheme.
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which can be written as 0.75.

Step 2: calculating the interest earned yearly
Interest = Principal * Rate
Interest = $300 * 0.75

Step 3: calculating the interest earned yearly
Interest = $300 * 0.75
Interest = $225

Step 4: calculating the amount after one year
Amount after one year = Principal + Interest
Amount after one year = $300 + $225
Amount after one year = $525

Step 5: calculating the amount after two years
Interest = Principal * Rate
Interest = $525 * 0.75

Step 6: calculating the interest earned in the second year
Interest = $525 * 0.75

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We know that there are 40 white shirts. Half of these shirts have collars, so there are 40 * 0.5 = <<40*0.5=20>>20 white shirts with collars. Therefore, there must be 40 - 20 = <<40-20=20>>20 white shirts with no collars.
2. Next, we have 50 floral shirts. Among these shirts, 20 have buttons. So, there are 50 - 20 = <<50-20=30>>30 floral shirts with no buttons.

Now, let's compare the number of shirts with no collars for white shirts and the number of shirts with no buttons for floral shirts:

3. We found that there are 20 white shirts with no collars.
4. As mentioned earlier, there are 30 floral shirts with no buttons.

To find the difference between these two numbers, we simply subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons:

5. ! The final answer is 30 (floral shirts with no buttons) - 20 (white shirts with no collars) = <<30-20=10>>10.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the number of goats in each farm before any sales occurred.

We know that Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. So, the total number of goats before the sales was 55 (Farm X) + 45 (Farm Y) = {100 goats}.

Step 2: Determine the number of goats sold from each farm.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, and he sold twice as many goats from Farm Y. Since Farm Y goats sold was 10 more than Farm X goats sold, we have:

1. Farm X sold: 10 goats
2. Farm Y sold: 10 (base) + 10 (2 * 10 for ""twice as many"") = 20 goats

Step 3: Calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sales.

To find the remaining number of goats in each farm, we subtract the sold goats from the initial number.

1. Farm X: Initial = 55, Sold = 10, Remaining = 55 - 10 = 45 goats
2. Farm Y: Initial = 45, Sold = 20, Remaining = 45 - 20 = 25 goats

Step 4: Determine the total number of goats remaining in both farms.

To find the total number of goats remaining in the two farms, we add the remaining number of goats for each farm.

Total = Farm X remaining + Farm Y remaining = 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = {70 goats}

{The final answer is: 70 goats}</s>","There are 55 - 10 = <<55-10=45>>45 goats left in Farm X.
Mr. Smith sold 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 goats from Farm Y.

                    question:
                    A local : town is expanding and wants to . build . several new homes , across ; the ; next three years. In the first year, they will build ? 12 : homes. ! In the , next year, : they will ; build three times ; this ! many homes. In the third year, they ? will count how many homes ! they ? have built and double the amount. How many homes ! will the town have built ! over the next : three years?
                 [/INST] Step 1: In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

Step 2: In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as the first year, so they will build:
12 homes * 3 = 36 homes

Step 3: In the third year, they will count how many homes they have built and double the amount. Let's assume they have built x homes in the first two years:
x + (12 + 36) = 2(x + 48)

Step 4: To solve for x, first subtract 48 from both sides:
x + 48 = 2x + 96

Step 5: Subtract x from both sides:
48 = x + 96

Step 6: Subtract 48 from both sides:
0 = 48 + x

Step 7: Subtract 48 from both sides (again):
-48 = x

Step 8: Since they built -48 homes in the first two years, which is not possible, there must be an error in the problem statement. Thus, the question as stated does not have a valid solution.

However, if we assume that in the second year they will build x additional homes, instead of three times as many homes as the first year, then the problem becomes solvable.

Step 9: In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years:
x + 12 + 36 = 2(x + 12)

Step 10: Simplify the equation:
x + 12 + 36 = 2x + 24

Step 11: Subtract x from both sides:
12 + 36 = 2x + 24

Step 12: Subtract 36 from both sides:
36 = 2x + 24

Step 13: Subtract 24 from both sides:
12 = 2x

Step 14: Divide both sides by 2:
x = 6

Step 15: In the first two years, they will build x + 12 = 6 + 12 = 18 homes.

Step 16: In the third year, they will build 2x = 2*6 = 12 homes.

Step 17: In total, they will build 18 + 12 = 30 homes over the next three years.

{The final answer is 30 homes.}</s>","In the second year, they build three times as many homes as the first year which is 12 * 3 = <<12*3=36>>36 homes.
So far in the two years, they've built 36+12 = <<36+12=48>>48 homes
In the third year, they double the number of homes built in the first two years, so 48*2 = <<48*2=96>>96 homes.
Altogether, the local town has built 48+ 96 = <<48+96=144>>144 homes.

1. Let X be your brother's age. Then, your age is (X - 3), and your sister's age is (X - 2).
2. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age. In equation form, this is:
     Mom's age = 3X - 1
3. The sum of all your ages is 87:
     X + (X - 3) + (X - 2) = 87
4. Simplifying the equation:
     3X - 1 + X - 3 + X - 2 = 87
5. Combining like terms:
     3X + X + X - 5 = 87
6. Solving for X:
     (3X + X + X) - 5 = 87
     (3X + 2X + X) = 82
     (6X + 2) = 82
7. Divide both sides by 6 to find X:
     X = (82 - 2) / 6
     X = 13.666...
8. Since ages are whole numbers, we need to round X to the nearest whole number.

The final answer is: Your brother is 14 years old.</s>","Let X be my age. My brother is X + 3 years old. My sister is X - 2 years old.
My mom is (X + 3) * 3 - 1 years old.

Multiplying through the parentheses and combining like terms, you get X*6 + 9 = 87 years old.
Subtracting nine from both sides and dividing both sides by 6, you get X = 13 years old.

Total glue sticks = Number of students * Glue sticks per student
Total glue sticks = 27 students * 2 glue sticks
Total glue sticks = 54 glue sticks

Step 3: Determine how many glue sticks come in each pack.
Each pack contains 8 glue sticks.

Step 4: Calculate how many packs are needed to provide 2 glue sticks for each student.
Packs required = Total glue sticks / Glue sticks per pack
Packs required = 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks per pack
Packs required = 7 packs

Step 5: Calculate the total number of glue sticks in the required packs.
Total glue sticks in packs = Packs required * Glue sticks per pack
Total glue sticks in packs = 7 packs * 8 glue sticks per pack

Total glue sticks to buy = 56 glue sticks + 8 glue sticks
Total glue sticks to buy = 64 glue sticks

Step 8: Calculate the number of packs required to buy the needed glue sticks.
Packs required to buy = Total glue sticks to buy / Glue sticks per pack
Packs required to buy = 64 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks per pack

1. We know that Gretchen has some coins. A certain number of those coins are silver, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, we have the equation: Silver Coins = x, Gold Coins = x + 30.
2. We also know that Gretchen had 70 gold coins. Using this information, we can create a second equation: Gold Coins = 70.
3. Now, we need to find the total number of coins Gretchen has by solving the system of equations. First, we'll find the number of silver coins using the first equation: Silver Coins = x.
4. We know there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so Gold Coins = x + 30.
5. Since Gold Coins = 70, we can set up the equation: x + 30 = 70.
6. Solving for x, we get x = 40. So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.
7. Using the first equation (Silver Coins = x), we find that Gretchen has a total of 40 + 30 = 70 silver coins.
8. Substituting the number of silver coins back into the equation for gold coins (Gold Coins = x + 30), we get Gold Coins = 40 + 30 = 70.

1. We know that the rink has 12 red cars.
2. There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so there are 10 * 3 = 30 blue cars.
4. The total number of cars is 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) + X (yellow).
5. We're told that the rink has a total of 75 cars, so we need to find X (yellow).
6. Substituting the values we have, we get 12 + 10 + 30 + X = 75.

                 [/INST] To find out how many books Fawn has, we first need to find out how many books Sofie and Anne have, and then use the given information to determine Fawn's book count.

1. We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne. Let's represent the number of books Anne has with the variable A.
   Then, the number of books Sofie has is A + 25.

2. We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. Let's represent the number of books Fawn has with the variable F.
   Then, the number of books Anne has is F - 12.

3. We know that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. So, we can set up the following equation:
         A + (A + 25) + F = 85

4. Simplifying the left side of the equation:
         2A + 25 + F = 85

5. Our goal is to solve for F (Fawn's book count). First, we need to eliminate A from the equation:
         2A + 25 = 85 - F

6. Moving the term with the variable to one side, we get:
          2A + 25 = 85 - F
         2A = 85 - F - 25
         2A = 60 - F

7. Now, we can express F in terms of A, but since we want to find F and not A, we need to find a way to isolate F. To do that, let's try to get rid of A in the equation.

8. We can't eliminate A directly, but we can express F in terms of the difference between F and A (which is given in the problem as ""25 more books for Sofie""). This difference is represented by the variable S:
          F = A + S
          F = (F - 12) + S

9. Substituting F - 12 for A in the previous equation:
          2(F - 12) = 60 - F
         2F - 24 = 60 - F
         2F - 60 = -F - 24
         3F = 36

10. Solving for F, we get:
          F = 36 / 3
          F = 12

However, we made an error in step 5, we used the incorrect value in the simplified equation. The correct equation from step 4 is:

         2A + 25 = 85
         2A = 60
          A = 30

And, the correct value for Anne's book count is 30. Now we can find F (Sofie's and Fawn's book counts):

          F = A + S
          F = 30 + 25
          F = 55

And the other person, Fawn, has 55 books.

{The final answer is: Fawn has 55 books.}</s>","Let x = the number of books Anne has.
Then x + 25 + x + 12 + x = 85
3x + 37 = 85
3x = 48
x = 48 / 3 = <<48/3=16>>16 books
Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

Step 1: Determine the weight of the bag of potatoes.
Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds.

Step 2: Determine the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes.
The bag of sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the bag of potatoes. So,
Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * Weight of potatoes
Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * 5 lb
Weight of sweet potatoes = 10 lb

Step 3: Determine the weight of the bag of carrots.
The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the bag of sweet potatoes. So,
Weight of carrots = Weight of sweet potatoes - 3 lb
Weight of carrots = 10 lb - 3 lb
Weight of carrots = 7 lb

Step 2: Determine how many jello cups are needed in total for the party. This information is given in the problem, stating that there will be 30 kids at the party, and each kid will have 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is 30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups.

Step 3: Calculate how many 3-ounce boxes of jello Greg will need to buy in order to make 120 jello cups. We know that one 3-ounce box makes 10 jello cups. So, to make 120 jello cups, we need 120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes of jello.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the jello by multiplying the number of boxes needed by the price per box. The price of a 3-ounce box of jello is currently $1.25. So, the total cost of jello for the party is 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.00.

1. The electronics seller bought 5 phones, each costing $700. So the total cost of the phones is:
   5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500

2. The seller received $4000 in dollars in exchange for these phones. To find out how much change the seller is giving back, we need to subtract the cost of the phones from the amount of money received.

3. Change = Amount of money received - Cost of phones
           = $4000 - $3500
           = $500

Step 2: Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, so we need to find out how much she pays and then subtract that amount from the total cost to find out how much Keenan pays.

Step 3: To find out how much Madeline pays, we calculate 60% of $400:
Madeline's share = Total cost * Percentage paid by Madeline
= $400 * 0.6
= $240

Step 4: To find out how much Keenan pays, we subtract Madeline's share from the total cost:
Keenan's share = Total cost - Madeline's share
= $400 - $240
= $160

Step 5: In a four-week month, there are usually 4 weeks * 7 days/week = 28 days, so the total number of days in a month is 28. However, we want to know how much Keenan spends per week, so we'll divide his monthly spending by 4 instead of 28:
Weekly spending for Keenan = Monthly spending / number of weeks

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to determine the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

Cost of one bottle of soda = Cost of 7 bottles of soda / Number of bottles of soda
Cost of one bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7
Cost of one bottle of soda ≈ $3.00

Cost of one bottle of water = Cost of 4 bottles of water / Number of bottles of water
Cost of one bottle of water = $8.00 / 4
Cost of one bottle of water = $2.00

Step 2: Now that we know the cost of one bottle of each, we can calculate the cost of the soda and water that David wants to buy.

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * Cost of one bottle of soda
Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00
Cost of 3 bottles of soda = $9.00

Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * Cost of one bottle of water
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = $4.00

Step 3: The total cost of what David wants to buy is the cost of the soda plus the cost of the water.

Total cost = Cost of 3 bottles of soda + Cost of 2 bottles of water

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many chickens Isaias intends to sell.
Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of his chickens. So, the number of chickens he intends to sell is:
300 chickens × (3/5) = 180 chickens

Step 2: Calculate the total profit Isaias intends to make.
Isaias intends to make a profit of $2000. Since he sells each chicken for $50, the number of chickens he needs to sell to make his profit is:
$2000 profits ÷ $50 profit per chicken = 40 chickens more than the 180 chickens he initially planned to sell
So, Isaias intends to sell 180 + 40 = 220 chickens in total

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Isaias makes from selling all the chickens.
Total revenue = Number of chickens sold × Selling price per chicken
Total revenue = 220 chickens × $50/chicken = $11,000

Step 4: Determine the cost of the chickens Isaias sold.
To find the cost of the chickens Isaias sold, subtract his total profit from his total revenue.
Cost of chickens sold = Total revenue - Total profit
Cost of chickens sold = $11,000 - $2,000 = $9,000

Step 5: Find out how much money Isaias spent on the chickens that he sold.
Since Isaias still has 300 - 220 = 80 chickens on his farm, the cost of the chickens that he sold is equal to the cost of the 220 chickens he sold.

{The final answer is: $9,000}</s>","Isaias plans to sell 3/5*300 = <<3/5*300=180>>180 chickens from his farm.

So, Micah sold: 32 (total number of glasses sold) - 14 (number of glasses Julie sold) = 18 glasses

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

The final answer is: Julie sold 14 - 18 = -4 more glasses than Micah.

                 [/INST] To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to find out the total cost of her hair treatment, manicure, and pedicure.

First, let's find the cost of the manicure. We know that 1/4 of the cost of her hair treatment was spent on her manicure. So, the cost of her manicure is $400 * 1/4 = $100.

Next, let's find the cost of her pedicure. We know that 3/4 of the cost of her manicure was spent on her pedicure. So, the cost of her pedicure is $100 * 3/4 = $133.33 (rounded to the nearest cent).

Now we have the costs of her manicure and pedicure but we don't know the cost of her hair treatment. We can find the cost of her hair treatment by using the given information about her manicure and pedicure costs. We know that manicure cost was 1/4 of the hair treatment and pedicure cost was 3/4 of manicure cost. So we can say that :

Hair treatment cost = 4 * (Manicure cost)

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Sarah receives for selling the rope.
The rope is 20 meters long and her friend buys it for $2 per meter. So, the total amount Sarah receives is: 20 meters × $2/meter = $40

Step 2: Determine how many meters of the new rope Sarah can buy with the profit.
The profit is the difference between the amount Sarah received for selling the old rope and the cost of the new rope. So, the profit is $40 - (Number of meters of new rope × $1.5/meter). We'll find the number of meters of the new rope that leave Sarah with a certain amount of money left over.

Let x be the number of meters of the new rope, and let y be the amount of money Sarah has left over after buying the new rope. We have: $40 = (20 m old rope) × $2/m + (x m new rope) × $1.5/m + y

We want to find the value of x that gives a positive value for y. We'll start by solving for x in terms of y: (20)($2) + (x)($1.5) + y = $40
Now, we can simplify the equation: 40 + 1.5x + y = 40

Step 3: Find the value of x for which Sarah has a positive amount of money left over.
To ensure Sarah has some money left over, we can assume an amount, say z > 0, and find the value of x for which y > z.

Let z = $5, then y > z => y > $5.
Solving the inequality 1.5x + y > $5: 1.5x > $3 (subtract y from both sides and make x the subject)
x > 12.67 meters (divide both sides by 1.5 and round up since x must be an integer)

Since x must be an integer, x = 13 meters is the nearest integer value.
So, Sarah will have $40 - (13 m new rope) × $1.5/m = $9.50 left over after buying a new 13-meter rope.

{The final answer is: Sarah will have $9.50 left over.}</s>","Her friend pays her $40 for the rope because 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40
She can buy the rope at the store for $30 because 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30
She has $10 left over because 40 - 30 = <<40-30=10>>10

                 [/INST] To solve this problem, let's first find out Melanie's present age, and then find out how many years her age will be triple in 10 years.

1. Melanie's age in 10 years:
- She will be 18 years old in 10 years.

2. Present age of Melanie:
- To find her present age, we need to subtract 10 years from her age in 10 years:
Present age = Age in 10 years - 10
Present age = 18 - 10
Present age = 8

3. Number of years until her age is triple:
- Let's assume Melanie's present age is x.
- In x years, Melanie's age will be x + x = 2x.
- In 10 years, Melanie's age will be x + 10.
- For her age to be triple her present age in 10 years, 2x = 3(x + 10).
- Solving for x: 2x = 3x + 30 => x = 30.

Answer: Melanie's present age is 30. In 10 years, her age will be triple her present age, and her age will be 90 (3 * 30). {The final answer is: Present age is 30, and in 10 years, her age will be 90.}</s>","Melanie's present age is 18 - 10 = <<18-10=8>>8.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the cost of bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples.
- Cost of 5 packs of bacon = $10 (total)
- Cost of 6 packets of chicken = Each packet costs twice the price of a pack of bacon, so each chicken packet costs $10 × 2 = $20. Cost of all chicken packets = $20 × 6 = $120.
- Cost of 3 packs of strawberries = $4 each, so the cost of all strawberry packs = $4 × 3 = $12.
- Cost of 7 packs of apples = Each apple pack is half the price of a strawberry pack, so each apple pack costs $4 / 2 = $2. Cost of all apple packs = $2 × 7 = $14.

Step 2: Find the total amount spent on all items.
Total spent = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples = $10 + $120+ $12+ $14 = $146.

Step 3: Determine how much money is left in the budget by subtracting the total spent from the budget.
Money left = Budget - Total spent = $65 - $146 = $ (-81).

However, this result indicates a negative value, meaning that Kelly does not have enough money left in her budget to purchase all the items she has in her cart. Therefore, she should consider either reducing the number of items or finding cheaper alternatives.

{The final answer is: Kelly does not have enough money left in her budget ($81 short).}</s>","Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.

1. Elaina's final concert runs for 65 minutes, but we're told that she makes this concert twice as long as her usual concert.

2. Therefore, the runtime of her usual concerts is half that of the final concert: 65 minutes / 2 = 32.5 minutes.

3. However, since concert times are usually given in whole numbers (minutes and seconds), we need to find the nearest whole number to 32.5 minutes as a reasonable approximation for the length of her usual concerts.

4. The nearest whole number to 32.5 minutes is 33 minutes. Thus, her usual concerts run for 33 minutes.

To find the total number of toys given away, we add the number of toys given to each person:

Total toys given away = Toys for Alyssa + Toys for Bonnie + Toys for Nicky
Total toys given away = 40 + 80 + 30
Total toys given away = 150

Now that we know Argo gave away 150 toys, we can find out how many toys he has left by subtracting the number of toys given away from the original number of toys Argo had:

The singer has a total of 50 microphones. To find out how many pairs of microphones (each consisting of 2 microphones) can be arranged, we need to divide the total number of microphones by 2:
50 microphones ÷ 2 microphones per pair = 25 pairs of microphones

Step 2: Calculate how many microphones will not be able to form pairs.
The problem states that 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in. To determine how many microphones this represents, we need to find 20% of the total number of microphones:
0.20 × 50 = 10 microphones

Step 3: Subtract the microphones that won't form pairs from the total number of microphones to find the number of microphones that can form pairs.
50 microphones - 10 microphones = 40 microphones
Since there are still 25 pairs of microphones that can be arranged with these 40 microphones, no pairs are affected by the unpaired microphones.

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange all 25 pairs of microphones on the stage.

{The final answer is: 25 pairs of microphones}</s>","The number of microphones that were not able to find space on the stage is 20/100*50 = <<20/100*50=10>>10

Step 3: Find the number of birds in three groups. Each group consists of 8 birds. So, we have 3 groups and therefore the number of birds in these groups is 3 times the number of birds in one group.
- Number of birds in one group = 8
- Number of birds in the three groups = 8 * 3 = 24
{Number of birds in three groups = 24}

Step 4: Find the total number of birds that Jerry counts.
- Number of birds in bushes = 6
- Number of birds flying overhead = 4
- Number of birds in three groups = 24
- Total number of birds = 6 (birds in bushes) + 4 (birds flying overhead) + 24 (birds in three groups)
Total number of birds = 34

1. Lani baked a total of 55 cookies.
2. She ate 5 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 55 - 5 = 50 cookies.
3. She divided the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars.
4. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we simply divide the total number of remaining cookies by the number of jars.

Step 3: Compare the total number of petals for both types of flowers.
The difference in the number of petals is calculated as follows:

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Mrs. Smith has 100 plants in her garden.
2. One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. So, we find out how many indoor plants there are: 100 (total plants) * 1/4 (fraction of indoor plants) = 25 indoor plants.
3. Now, we know that two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Let's calculate how many remaining plants there are after subtracting the indoor plants: 100 (total plants) - 25 (indoor plants) = 75 remaining plants.
4. We find out how many outdoor plants there are: 75 (remaining plants) * 2/3 (fraction of outdoor plants) = 50 outdoor plants.
5. Lastly, we want to determine what percent of plants are flowering plants. However, the problem doesn't provide enough information to determine how many flowers there are, as we only know the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

Unfortunately, without more information, it's impossible to find out what percent of the plants are flowering plants.

                 [/INST] Let's assume the speed of a thingamabob is represented by the variable ""x"" in meters per second.

1. We know that a whirligig spins five times the speed of a thingamabob, so its angular velocity is 5 x.
2. We also know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, so its angular velocity is 11 x.
3. To find the linear velocity of the whirligig, we need to convert its angular velocity to linear velocity. The relationship between angular velocity (ω) and linear velocity (v) for a circular motion is given by the equation: v = ω * r, where r is the radius of the circle. Since no information about the radii of the whirligig and whatchamacallit is given, we'll assume they have the same radius for simplicity.
4. The angular velocity of a whirligig is 5 x, so its linear velocity is v = 5 x * r = 5rx.
5. We're told that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. Let's solve for the angular velocity of a whatchamacallit: v = 11 x * r => 121 = 11 x * r => x = 11 * (121 / r).
6. Since we don't know the radius, we cannot determine the individual values of x, r, or the angular velocities of the whirligig and whatchamacallit. We can only determine the ratio of their angular velocities.

Therefore, we cannot find the exact spinning speed of a whirligig or a whatchamacallit with the given information.

1. We know that Ellen eats a certain number of items every day, which includes two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt.

2. The cost of the salad is $6, and the yogurt costs half that amount.

3. Therefore, the cost of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

4. The total cost of all her daily items is $11.

5. We're trying to find the cost of one carrot, so we need to find the cost of all items except for carrots and then subtract that from the total cost.

6. The cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

7. So, the cost of two carrots must be $11 - $9 = $2.

8. Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is: Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.</s>","Ellen's yogurt cost is half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate Mark's hourly wage after the pay raise.
Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:

New hourly wage = Old hourly wage + Pay raise
New hourly wage = $10 + $2
New hourly wage = $12 per hour

Step 2: Calculate the number of hours Mark works in a week.
Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. Therefore, the number of hours he works in a week is:

Hours worked in a week = Hours worked per day * Days worked per week
Hours worked in a week = 8 hours/day * 5 days/week
Hours worked in a week = 40 hours/week

Step 3: Calculate Mark's weekly earnings.
Mark's hourly wage is now $12, and he works 40 hours a week. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:

                 [/INST] First, let's identify the variables in the problem:

* $80: the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales last month
* ?: the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn the first week
* ^: the number of times more Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn than Joe's the first week
* $6: the amount Tasha was paid by Joe for mowing his lawn once
* ! Alba: the person whose lawn Tasha mowed the second week

Now let's find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn the first week:

Since Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, we can write the equation: Kamala's lawns = 3 * Joe's lawns

Let x be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Then, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn was 3x. Since 3x = 3 * (number of Joe's lawns), the number of Joe's lawns was x.

We know that Tasha earned $6 for each mowing job, so the earnings from mowing Joe's lawns were 6x.

Since her total earnings last month were $80, her earnings from selling lemonade were $80 - 6x.

The second week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as often as she did Joe's: Alba's lawns = 5 * Joe's lawns

Substituting x for the number of Joe's lawns, we get Alba's lawns = 5x

Since her earnings from mowing lawns were $6 per lawn, her earnings from mowing Alba's lawns were 5x * $6 = $30x.

However, the problem states that the final answer is the amount she made from lemonade sales last month. To find that amount, we need to subtract her earnings from lawn mowing from her total earnings last month: $80 - ($6x + $30x)

Simplifying, we get: $80 - $36x = $80 - $36 * (number of times she went to the lemonade stand)

Dividing by $36, we get: number of times she went to the lemonade stand = (80 - $36x) / $36

Since this equation does not have a specific value for x, we cannot provide a numerical answer for the number of times she went to the lemonade stand or the amount she made from lemonade sales.

{The final answer is: (80 - $36x) / $36}

That is, the number of times she went to the lemonade stand or the amount she made from lemonade sales depends on the number of times she mowed lawns, which was not provided in the problem.</s>","At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars
Since the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.
Adding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars
Subtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars
Tasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.

First, let's calculate how much John earns in a single rental by multiplying the number of hours by the hourly rate:

$25 hourly rate * 3 hours = $75 earned per rental

Next, let's calculate John's monthly earnings by multiplying his earnings per rental by the number of rentals per month:

$75 per rental * 10 rentals per month = $750 per month

Now, we need to determine how much profit John makes per month after subtracting his car payment:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas.

Step 2: She was going to divide them equally among her 6 nephews. So the number of cookies each nephew would get is the total number of cookies divided by the number of nephews.

Number of cookies for each nephew = Total cookies / Number of nephews

Step 3: Before Susan could package the cookies, her husband took 4 cookies for himself.

Step 4: Now, Susan has 96 cookies left for her nephews.

Step 5: To find out how many cookies each nephew will get now, we'll calculate the number of cookies per nephew based on the updated number of cookies available.

Number of cookies for each nephew = Total cookies for nephews / Number of nephews

Total cookies for nephews = 96 (remaining cookies after husband took some)

Step 6: So,

Number of cookies for each nephew = 96 / 6

Using long division or a calculator, we find that the result is approximately 16 with a remainder of 0. However, since there are no fractions of a cookie in this scenario, we'll assume that the remainder is added to the result and round up if necessary. Instead, we can simplify the division by dividing by 2 first, then dividing the result by 3.

Number of cookies for each nephew = (16 + 1) / 3

Number of cookies for each nephew = 17 / 3

However, this result is not a whole number, which doesn't make sense in this situation. Since we assumed the remainder was added to the quotient in the division calculation, that means we should have increased the numerator by 1 in the division step before the final division by 3. So the correct calculation is:

Number of cookies for each nephew = (16 + 2) / 3

Number of cookies for each nephew = 17 / 3

To get a whole number of cookies per nephew, we'll round down this result.

So, the calculation should be:

Number of cookies for each nephew = ((100 - 4) / 6) ≈ 15.83 ≈ 15 (rounded down)

{The final answer is: Each nephew will get about 15 cookies.}

However, an alternative answer would be:
Since Susan and her husband did not seem to mind about not dividing the cookies exactly evenly, we could leave the calculation as a non-integer answer.

So, the calculation would be:
Number of cookies for each nephew = 100 / 6 ≈ 16.67 ≈ 17 (assuming husband took 4 cookies)

                 [/INST] To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we first need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the soup in Calvin's pot.

Given that Calvin and his family consist of two adults and two children, the number of bowls required for one meal for the whole family is:
2 adults * 1 bowl (per person) + 2 children * 1 bowl (per person) = 4 bowls

The pot in the kitchen can fill either 4 adult's bowls or 8 children's bowls, so let's find out which is the case and how many bowls the pot can fill in total. We will use the fact that an adult's bowl can hold the same volume of soup as two children's bowls.

First, let's find the number of child's bowls that can be filled from the pot:
Since 1 adult bowl holds the same volume as 2 child bowls, the pot can fill:
`number_of_child_bowls = number_of_adult_bowls * 2`

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls, so the number of child bowls it can fill is:
`number_of_child_bowls = 4 * 2 = 8`

Therefore, the total number of bowls that can be filled from the pot is 8 child's bowls. Since each child can have one bowl at lunch, the number of lunches for the children is:

{The final answer is: Each child can have 8/2 = 4 lunches with soup from the leftover soup}

So, each child will be able to have 4 lunches with soup made for dinner from the leftovers in the pot.</s>","Four adult bowls equal eight children’s bowls, so each adult bowl is 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 children’s bowls.
Calvin and his wife will eat two adult bowls, so they will eat the equivalent of 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 children’s bowls.
Thus, he, his wife, and their children will eat 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 children’s bowls at dinner.
After dinner, there will be 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 children’s bowls left over.
There are 2 children, so each child will be able to eat a bowl of leftover soup for lunch 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1 time.

1. Small masks:
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Thus, the material needed for one small mask is 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yard/mask.

2. Large masks:
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Thus, the material needed for one large mask is 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yard/mask.

Now, let's calculate the material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

3. Material for small masks:
   - 20 small masks require 20 masks * 0.5 yard/mask = 10 yard.

4. Material for large masks:
   - 8 large masks require 8 masks * 0.75 yard/mask = 6 yard.

Therefore, the total material needed is {The final answer is: 10 yard (for small masks) + 6 yard (for large masks) = 16 yard}.</s>","It takes 2 yards of material / 4 small masks = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 yards of material per mask.

For the small masks, it will take 20 masks x 0.5 yards = <<20*0.5=10>>10 yards of material.
For the large masks, it will take 8 masks x 0.75 yards = <<8*0.75=6>>6 yards of material.

3. Deepa spent a total of $216 on these tickets.
4. To find the average price of a ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets: $216 / 27 tickets.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night, so:
Sleeping hours = 10 hours

Harold works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so:
Working hours = Sleeping hours - 2 hours = 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours

Step 2: Now let's calculate how long Harold spends on sleeping, working, and walking his dog.
Total hours spent = Sleeping hours + Working hours + Dog walking hours
Since Harold walks his dog for 1 hour per day:
Total hours spent = 10 hours + 8 hours + 1 hour = 19 hours

Step 3: However, we know that there are 24 hours in a day. Let's find out how much free time Harold has left by subtracting the total hours spent from the hours in a day.
Free time hours = Hours in a day - Total hours spent
Free time hours = 24 hours - 19 hours = 5 hours

{The final answer is: Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.}</s>","He works 2 hours less than he sleeps and he sleeps for 10 hours so he works 10-2 = <<10-2=8>>8 hours

Step 1: Determine the difference in age between Duncan and Adam at two points in time.

We know that:
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.
- Duncan's age now is 60.

Let's represent Adam's age four years ago as X. Then, eight years ago, Duncan's age was 2X. Since Duncan is now 60, we can write the equation:

60 = 2X + (X - 4)

Step 2: Solve for X.

Subtract X from both sides of the equation:

56 = X + X - 4

Combine like terms:

56 = 2X - 4

Add 4 to both sides of the equation:

56 + 4 = 2X

56 + 4 = 2X => X = (56 + 4) / 2
X = 29

So, Adam was 29 years old four years ago.

Step 3: Find Adam's age in 8 years.

In 8 years, Adam will be 29 + 8 = 37 years old.

{The final answer is: Adam will be 37 years old in 8 years.}</s>","Eight years ago, Duncan was 60-8 = 52 years old, the same as Adam's age four years ago.

4. For 0.75 hours, there are 0.75 * 60 = 45 half hours.

5. For 3 hours, there are 3 * 60 * 0.5 = 90 half hours.

6. Therefore, the total number of bottles John drinks is 45 for a normal Sudoku puzzle + 90 for an extreme Sudoku puzzle = 135 bottles.

{The final answer is 135 bottles}</s>","He drinks a bottle of water every 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 minutes
It takes him 45*4=<<45*4=180>>180 minutes to solve an extreme sudoku

                 [/INST] To answer this question, let's first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at each type of balloon.

We know that:
- Each red balloon received 2 pieces of bologna
- Each yellow balloon received 3 pieces of bologna

Let's denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y.

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons is 2R.
The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons is 3Y.

The given information states that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons. So we have:

2R + 3Y = 58

We also know that there are 20 red balloons in the bundle. So R = 20.

Therefore, we can find the number of yellow balloons (Y) by solving this equation:

2(20) + 3Y = 58
40 + 3Y = 58
3Y = 18
Y = 6

{The final answer is: There are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.}</s>","If Benny had twenty red balloons in the bundle, and he threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, then he threw 2*20=40 pieces of bologna at red balloons in the bundle.
If he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at balloons in the bundle, then he threw 58-40=<<58-40=18>>18 pieces of bologna at yellow balloons.
If he threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, then he had 18/3=<<18/3=6>>6 yellow balloons.

                 [/INST] To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs in a 30-day month, we first need to calculate how many miles he drives in a month. We know that he drives 100 miles a day, so:

Miles driven in a month = Miles driven per day * Number of days
Miles driven in a month = 100 * 30

Now we need to find out how many tune-ups he needs based on the number of miles driven. We know that he needs a tune-up every 1000 miles:

Number of tune-ups = Miles driven in a month / Miles between tune-ups
Number of tune-ups = 100 * 30 / 1000

To simplify the calculation, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 100:

Number of tune-ups = 3 * 30 / 10

Now we can calculate the final answer by multiplying the result of that division by 1:

{The final answer is: 3 tune-ups}

Therefore, Jon needs to get his car tuned up three times in a 30-day month.</s>","He drives 100*30=<<100*30=3000>>3000 miles

1. The cost of the cake was $11.
2. The cost of 1 dozen balloons was $0.5 per balloon, so they bought a total of 1 dozen balloons, which cost $1 (12 balloons * $0.5).
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost of the ice cream was $14.
4. Therefore, the total amount spent on the surprise was $11 + $1 + $14 = $26.

Since we know that the two girls shared the same allowance from their mother, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out the amount each girl received.

Lola ate 2 pieces of bananas.

Now, let's subtract the pieces of fruit that Lola ate from the total amount that Kira bought:

Total pieces of fruit = 12
Pieces of fruit eaten by Lola = 2 (bananas)

1. There are 30 students in the class.
2. Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops.
3. The cost of each lollipop for the students was $0.5.
4. Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.

First, let's find out how many lollipops were sold in total. Since each student sold 10 lollipops on average:
Total lollipops sold = Number of students × Average number of lollipops sold per student
Total lollipops sold = 30 students × 10 lollipops
Total lollipops sold = 300 lollipops

Next, let's calculate the profit made on selling each lollipop: Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit per lollipop = $0.8 - $0.5
Profit per lollipop = $0.3

Now, to determine the total profit generated by selling 300 lollipops, we'll find the profit from selling one lollipop and multiply it by the total number of lollipops sold:
Total profit = Profit per lollipop × Total number of lollipops sold
Total profit = $0.3 per lollipop × 300 lollipops
Total profit = $90

{The final answer is} $90.</s>","The class got $0.8 - $0.5 = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3 profit from each lollipop.

How ; many : cups of mint tea : are in each row?
                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many cups of tea Lana is brewing in total. We know she is brewing for her friends and there are 27 full sets of chamomile and mint tea. Each set consists of equal amounts of both types of tea.

Let x be the number of cups of tea in each set. Then the total number of cups of tea Lana is brewing is:
27 sets * 2 types of tea * x cups per set = 54x

Next, we know that she divides this number of cups into 3 rows. So:
54x = 3 rows * (number of cups in each row for chamomile and mint)

We're given that in each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea. Let y be the number of cups of mint tea in each row. Then:
54x = 3 * (x + y)

To find the value of x and y, we can solve the equation. It might be easier to first find the value of y and then solve for x.

Let's assume that the number of cups of tea in each set (x) is a multiple of 3, so that the number of cups of tea in each row is a multiple of 3 as well. Since 54 is not a multiple of 3, we will need to find a multiple of 3 that is as close to 54 as possible.

We can try using 18 as the number of cups of tea in each set, since 18 * 2 * 3 = 54. That makes x = 18 and y = y.

Now let's check if the number of cups of mint tea in each row is a valid solution. We know that in each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, so the total number of cups of tea in each row is 3 * x = 3 * 18 = 54. Since she uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the remaining number of cups in each row would be 54 - 15 = 39.

However, we were asked to find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, which is half of the total number of cups of tea in each row since there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea. So, we need to find half the number of cups in each row.

Half the number of cups in each row is 39 / 2 = 19.5, which is not a valid solution since we cannot have half a cup of tea. Therefore, our assumption of x = 18 does not provide a valid solution.

Let's try using x = 16 instead, since 16 * 2 * 3 = 48, and 48 is a multiple of 3. That makes x = 16 and y = y.

The total number of cups of tea in each row is 3 * x = 3 * 16 = 48. The remaining number of cups in each row would be 48 - 15 = 33. Half the number of cups in each row is 33 / 2 = 16.5, which is not a valid solution since we cannot have half a cup of tea.

Therefore, the given problem has no valid solution, since we cannot find integers x and y that would satisfy the conditions of the problem.

{The final answer is: The problem has no valid solution.}</s>","If there are 15 cups of cinnamon tea, then there are a total of 27 – 15 = <<27-15=12>>12 cups of chamomile or mint tea.
As there are equal amounts of chamomile tea and mint tea, there is a total of 12 cups / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cups of mint tea.
Dividing these into rows shows that each row holds 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 cups of mint tea.

                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many berries the sloth can collect in one hour. We know that it takes 4 hours to collect and eat berries, so we'll divide the total number of berries (24) by the number of hours it takes to collect them:

24 berries ÷ 4 hours = 6 berries per hour

Now we want to know how many berries the sloth needs to collect in one hour to have 24 berries in 8 hours. To find this, we'll use the formula:

Total number of berries = Number of berries per hour × Number of hours

We know that the sloth needs a total of 24 berries and works for 8 hours. So,

24 berries = 6 berries per hour × Number of hours

Number of hours = 24 ÷ 6 = 4 hours

Therefore, the sloth must collect 6 berries per hour for 4 hours to have a total of 24 berries. This is what he's currently doing.

However, since we're trying to find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, let's see if we can optimize the number of trips.

Since the sloth moves very slowly and takes 4 hours to collect and eat berries, it seems likely that more than one trip could be made in 8 hours. Let's calculate how many trips can be made in 8 hours:

8 hours ÷ 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

We can have the sloth make two trips of 12 berries each, which would result in him having a total of 24 berries. Alternatively, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is:

Total number of berries = Number of berries per hour × Number of hours
24 berries = 6 berries per hour × Number of hours
Number of hours = 24 ÷ 6 = 4 hours
Minimum number of berries per trip = 24 berries ÷ 4 hours = 6 berries × 2 hours = 12 berries.

The final answer is that the sloth can pick up a minimum of 12 berries per trip if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.</s>","If one trip is 4-hours long, in 8 hours he can make 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 trips.
To collect 24 berries per 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 berries per trip.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the amount of water in the pool.
The pool contains 10,000 gallons of water.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water taken from the pool to fill the tank.
Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. So, they take:
Half of 10,000 gallons = 5,000 gallons

Step 3: Determine the volume of water in the tank after it is filled.
The tank is filled with 5,000 gallons of water from the pool.

Step 4: Calculate the amount of water used from the tank for watering the vegetable garden each day.
500 gallons of water are used per day.

Step 5: Calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days.
Water used in 6 days = Daily water use * Number of days
Water used in 6 days = 500 gallons * 6
Water used in 6 days = 3,000 gallons

Step 6: Calculate the amount of water left in the tank.
Initial tank volume = Pool water + Water used
Initial tank volume = 5,000 gallons + 3,000 gallons
Initial tank volume = 8,000 gallons

Amount of water remaining in the tank = Initial tank volume - Water used
Amount of water remaining in the tank = 8,000 gallons - 3,000 gallons

The final answer is: 5,000 gallons. However, this is actually the initial volume of water in the tank. It appears there was a mistake in the question as the tank should have only 5,000 gallons of water remaining after six days of watering. Therefore, the question might need to be reevaluated to provide the correct solution. {Corrected final answer: The final amount of water in the tank is 5,000 gallons.}</s>","The water pump takes 1/2 *10000 = <<5000=5000>>5000 gallons of the pool's water into the tank.
If 500 gallons of water is used daily for six days, the total amount of water used after six days is 500*6 = <<500*6=3000>>3000 gallons.
The total amount of water remaining in the tank will be 5000-3000 = <<5000-3000=2000>>2000 gallons

                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many movies Colby has seen on Fridays or Saturdays this month. We know he has seen 5 of them.

Next, we need to find out how many movies he can see with the remaining budget for this last day of the month.

Let x be the number of movies Colby can see on this last Friday. The cost of tickets, popcorn, and candy for one movie is $11 (($10 for the ticket) + ($8 for popcorn) + ($2 for a box of candy)).

We know that Colby has $132 left from his $150 budget after purchasing 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy. So the cost of 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy is $52.

We can set up an equation and solve for x:

$132 = x * $11

Dividing both sides by $11:

x = $132 / $11

x ≈ 12

Since Colby can only see one movie on this last Friday, and he has already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays this month, the final answer is:

He can see 1 movie on this last Friday, for a total of 6 movies (5 previous + 1 new) for this month.

{The final answer is: Colby can see 6 movies this month.}</s>","He has spent $50 on Fri/Sat movies because 5 x 10 = <<50=50>>50

Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, and a normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, we have:
Calories in 1 mini cinnamon roll = 600 calories * (1/3) = 200 calories
Total calories in 200 mini cinnamon rolls = 200 calories/roll * 200 rolls

Step 2: Calculate the total calories in blueberry muffins.
Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, we have:

Total calories in 300 mini blueberry muffins = 150 calories/muffin * 300 muffins

Step 3: Calculate the total calories in all the pastries.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. On Monday, she picked 39, so on Tuesday and Wednesday, she picked 39 x 2 = 78 Junebugs in total.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

So the total number of Junebugs she removed is: 39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 216 Junebugs.

The number of days she worked is 5 (Monday through Friday).

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs she removes per day is: {The final answer is 216 ÷ 5 = 43.2.

The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for a total of 5 hours.
Distance travelled by the bus = Speed * Time
Distance travelled by the bus = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by the car.
The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for a total of 8 hours.
Distance travelled by the car = Speed * Time
Distance travelled by the car = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours

Step 3: Find the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car.
Difference in distance = Distance travelled by the bus - Distance travelled by the car
Let's calculate the values:

Distance travelled by the bus = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles
Distance travelled by the car = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, let's find the difference:
Difference in distance = 300 miles - 240 miles

Step 4: Determine the final answer.
The final answer is: The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.
So, the bus traveled a total of 300 miles and the car traveled 240 miles. The difference between the two is 60 miles.</s>","The bus traveled 60 miles per hour * 5 hours = <<60*5=300>>300 miles.

We know that she has 31 blocks, 8 stuffed animals, 9 multicolored rings, and an unspecified number of bouncy balls. So the total number of toys is:

Total number of toys = Building blocks + Stuffed animals + Rings + Bouncy balls

We're given that the total number of toys is 62, so:

62 = 31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) + B (bouncy balls)

Now we want to find B, the number of bouncy balls. To do that, we need to isolate B on one side of the equation. We'll start by combining the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and rings:

Total number of toys = 31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) + B (bouncy balls)

Total number of toys = 48 + B

Next, we'll subtract 48 from both sides of the equation to isolate B:

B = Total number of toys - 48

B = 62 - 48

B = 14

{The final answer is: 14 bouncy balls}</s>","Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.
After buying the tube of balls, Sophie has 31 + 8 + 9 + T = 48 + T = 62 toys for her nephew.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years. Let's denote the age of Peter as P, the age of Paul as Paul, and the age of John as J.
2. We're given that Paul is 10 years older than Peter, so Paul's age is P + 10.
3. We're also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and John's ages. So we can write the equation: P = Paul + John => P = (P + 10) + J.
4. Solving this equation for John, we get: J = P - (P + 10) => J = P - P - 10 => J = -10 + P.
5. Now we have two equations relating the ages of Peter, Paul, and John: P + Paul + J = 100 and P = Paul + J.
6. Substituting Paul = P + 10 and J = -10 + P into the first equation, we get: P + P + 10 + (-10 + P) = 100.
7. Simplifying this equation, we have: 2P + 10 = 100 => 2P = 90 => P = 45.
8. We can find Paul's age by substituting P = 45 into Paul = P + 10, so Paul's age is 55.
9. And we can find John's age by substituting P = 45 and Paul = 55 into J = -10 + P and J = Paul + J, so John's age is 40.

{The final answer is: Peter's age is 45 years, Paul's age is 55 years, and John's age is 40 years.}</s>","Let x be the age of John. Paul’s age is x + 10
Peter’s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10
We have (2x + 10) + (x + 1) + x = 100
Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100
Subtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.
John is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the total number of boxes the charity group has after the donations.
Total number of boxes = Number of boxes donated by each person × Number of donors + Boxes they already had
Total number of boxes = 5 boxes/person × 10 people + 10 boxes
Total number of boxes = 50 boxes + 10 boxes
Total number of boxes = 60 boxes

Step 2: Calculate the number of boxes that can be placed on each table.
Each table can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff. So, the number of boxes each table can hold is 2 boxes × Number of boxes per box
Number of boxes each table can hold = 2 boxes × 1 cubic foot/box (assuming 1 cubic foot is the volume of a box)
Number of boxes each table can hold = 2 cubic feet

Step 3: Determine the number of tables they currently have.
They have 15 tables.

Step 4: Calculate the number of boxes their current tables can hold.
Number of boxes their current tables can hold = Number of boxes per table × Number of tables
Number of boxes their current tables can hold = 2 cubic feet/table × 15 tables
Number of boxes their current tables can hold = 30 cubic feet

Step 5: Find the number of new tables they need.
Number of new tables they need = Total number of boxes (after donations) - Number of boxes their current tables can hold
Number of new tables they need = 60 boxes - 30 cubic feet
Number of new tables they need = 30 boxes/cubic foot (assuming 1 cubic foot is the volume of a box) ÷ 30 cubic feet
Number of new tables they need = 1 new table

However, since a table can hold exactly 2 boxes, we need to round up the answer. This means they will require 2 new tables.

{The final answer is: They need 2 new tables.}</s>","There were 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 donated boxes

                 [/INST] To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we first need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then find the average of those two totals.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance spat by Zoey.
Total distance for Zoey = Number of seeds * Distance spitted per seed
Total distance for Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed
Total distance for Zoey = 400 feet

Step 2: Calculate the total distance spat by Sydney.
Total distance for Sydney = Number of seeds * Distance spitted per seed
Total distance for Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed
Total distance for Sydney = 420 feet

Step 3: Find the average total distance spat by both.
Average total distance = (Total distance for Zoey + Total distance for Sydney) / 2
Average total distance = (400 feet + 420 feet) / 2
Average total distance = 820 feet / 2

{The final answer is 410 feet.}</s>","Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = <<40*10=400>>400
Sydney spits a total distance of 420 feet because 35 x 12 = <<35*12=420>>420
This totals to 820 feet because 400 + 420 = <<400+420=820>>820
The average total distance is 410 because 820 / 2 = <<820/2=410>>410

                 [/INST] To find out how much more money Fern makes with the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we first need to calculate the hourly wage, daily wage, and monthly wage for each machine.

1. Hourly wage for Widgeteer 3000: 
   Fern makes 60 widgets an hour, and each widget sells for $6.
   So, the hourly wage for the Widgeteer 3000 is: $6/widget * 60 widgets/hour = $360/hour

2. Hourly wage for WidgetMaster 9000:
   Fern makes 45 widgets an hour with the WidgetMaster 9000, and each widget sells for $6.
   So, the hourly wage for the WidgetMaster 9000 is: $6/widget * 45 widgets/hour = $270/hour

3. Daily wage for Widgeteer 3000:
   Fern works for 24 hours a day, so the daily wage for the Widgeteer 3000 is: $360/hour * 24 hours/day = $8,640/day

4. Daily wage for WidgetMaster 9000:
   Fern works for 24 hours a day, so the daily wage for the WidgetMaster 9000 is: $270/hour * 24 hours/day = $6,480/day

5. Monthly wage difference:
   To find the monthly difference, we need to calculate the monthly wage for each machine and then subtract the smaller one from the larger one. Since there are 30 days in a month, the calculation is as follows:

- Monthly wage for Widgeteer 3000: $8,640/day * 30 days/month = $259,200/month
- Monthly wage for WidgetMaster 9000: $6,480/day * 30 days/month = $194,400/month

{The final answer is:} The difference in monthly wages is: $259,200/month - $194,400/month = $64,800/month. Therefore, Fern makes an additional $64,800/month with the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.</s>","First find how many more widgets the Widgeteer 3000 makes per hour: 60 widgets/hour - 45 widgets/hour = <<60-45=15>>15 widgets/hour
Then multiply that difference by the number of hours in a day to find the daily difference: 15 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = <<360=360>>360 widgets/day
Then multiply the daily difference by the number of days in a month to find the monthly difference: 360 widgets/day * 30 days/month = <<360*30=10800>>10,800 widgets/month
Then multiply that number by the cost per widget to find the total earnings difference: 10,800 widgets/month * $6/widget = $<<10800*6=64800>>64,800

12 hours * 1000 pesos/12 hours = 1000 pesos

Step 2: Calculate the cost for a 24-hour stay.
24 hours * 1600 pesos/24 hours = 1600 pesos

Step 3: Calculate the cost Cameron would pay for checking in at 5 pm and checking out at 10 am the next day (17 hours). He chooses to pay for 12 hours and then add on the hourly fee for every hour after that.
Cost for 12 hours = 1000 pesos
Cost for additional hours = (17 hours - 12 hours) * 70 pesos/hour = 680 pesos
Total cost for Cameron = 1000 pesos + 680 pesos = 1680 pesos

Step 4: Calculate the cost Cameron would pay for a 24-hour stay.
Cost for 24 hours = 1600 pesos

Step 5: Determine the difference between the cost Cameron actually paid and the cost for a 24-hour stay to find the savings.
Savings = 1680 pesos (Cost for actual stay) - 1600 pesos (Cost for 24-hour stay) = 80 pesos

{The final answer is: Cameron saves 80 pesos.}</s>","12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.
If Cameron wants to leave at 10 am, he must pay for an additional 10 am - 5 am = <<10-5=5>>5 hours.

Altogether, he must pay 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = <<1000+350=1350>>1350 pesos.
Therefore, he will save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = <<1600-1350=250>>250 pesos.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the hay requirements for each goat and each sheep.
- Goats: 5 pounds each.
- Sheep: 3 pounds less than twice the goat requirement, which is 2 * 5 - 3 = 8 pounds.

Step 2: Determine the total hay requirement for each animal type.
- Goats: Number of goats * Hay requirement per goat: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds/goat.
- Sheep: Number of sheep * Hay requirement per sheep: 12 sheep * 8 pounds/sheep = 96 pounds/sheep.

Step 3: Calculate the total hay requirement for both animal types.
Total hay requirement = Goat hay requirement + Sheep hay requirement: 75 pounds/goat * Number of goats + 8 pounds/sheep * Number of sheep.
Total hay requirement = 75 pounds/goat * 15 goats + 8 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep.

Step 4: Calculate the total hay requirement: 75 * 15 + 8 * 12 = 1125 + 96 = 1221 pounds.

                 [/INST] First, let's calculate how much John earned in total during the week:

Earnings per hour = $50
Hours worked per week = 6 * 7 = 42 hours (since he worked for 6 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week)

Total earnings = Earnings per hour * Hours worked per week
Total earnings = $50/hour * 42 hours
Total earnings = $2100

Next, we need to find out how much money John has left after spending on gas and the bank deposit.

Money spent on gas = $50
Money deposited in the bank = $100
Total money spent = $50 + $100 = $150

Subtract the total money spent from the total earnings to find out how much money John has left:

Money left = Total earnings - Money spent
Money left = $2100 - $150
Money left = $2085

Now let's find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the money left:

Cost of one pen = $25
Number of pens = Money left / Cost per pen
Number of pens = $2085 / $25
Number of pens = 83.4
Since John can't buy a fraction of a pen, he can buy a maximum of 83 pens.

However, John wanted to know how many pens he could buy after buying 5 pencils that cost $10 each. But that information was missing from the question, so we can't calculate that directly.

To calculate the number of pens John can buy after buying 5 pencils, we need to know the total cost of the 5 pencils and pen purchases. Let's assume that the total cost of the 5 pencils is $5 (we don't have a specific number in the problem, so we'll assume this for now). Then we need to find how many pens John can buy with the remaining money:

Money spent on pencils = $5
Money left = $2085 - $5
Money left = $2080
Number of pens = Money left / Cost per pen
Number of pens = $2080 / $25
Number of pens = 83.2
Since John can't buy a fraction of a pen, he can buy a maximum of 83 pens with $2080.

So, if John spends $5 on pencils and has $2085 left to spend on pens, he can buy a maximum of 83 pens.

{The final answer is that John can buy a maximum of 83 pens with what's left after spending $5 on pencils and $150 on gas and a $100 bank deposit, assuming the cost of a pen is $25.}</s>","He earned $50*6=$<<50*6=300>>300

After buying gas and pencils he has $200 - $50 - $50 = $<<200-50-50=100>>100 to spend on pens
He can buy $100/25=<<100/25=4>>4 pens

1. Craig and his brother take turns spelling out the longest letter words they know, counting the number of letters in those words. After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each.
2. So, Craig has spelled out a total of 20 words x 15 letters = 300 letters.
3. Craig's brother has spelled out more words than Craig; the difference is 50 more letters.
4. Therefore, Craig's brother has spelled out 20 words (same as Craig) x 16 letters (15 letters for Craig plus the extra 50 letters) = 320 letters.
5. Together, they have spelled out 300 (Craig's words) + 320 (Craig's brother's words) = 620 letters.

Step 3: The teacher gave out 116 bottles of apple juice to the students. So the teacher still has the initial 900 bottles minus the 116 bottles she gave away.

Step 4: Subtract the number of bottles the teacher gave to the students from the total number of bottles she has. So the teacher has 900 - 116 = <strong>784</strong> bottles of apple juice left for herself.

James bought 10 CDs, each costing $15. So, the total cost was:
10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Step 2: Calculate the discounted price of the CDs James bought.
The CDs were bought at a 40% discount, so the price James actually paid was:
$150 * (1 - 0.40) = $150 * 0.6 = $90

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the CDs that James didn't like and sold.
He didn't like 5 of them, so the cost of these CDs was:
5 CDs * $15/CD = $75

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money James received by selling the CDs he didn't like.
He sold these CDs for $40, so:
$75 -> $40 = $35
This means that James received $35 from selling the CDs he didn't like.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the CDs James kept.
The cost of the CDs James didn't sell was the original cost minus the cost of the CDs he sold:
$150 - $75 = $75

Step 6: Calculate the amount of money James was out by buying the CDs.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the revenue from selling yams.
Revenue from selling yams = Number of yams * Price per yam
Revenue from selling yams = 6 * $1.5
Revenue from selling yams = $9

Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling sweet potatoes.
Revenue from selling sweet potatoes = Number of sweet potatoes * Price per sweet potato
Revenue from selling sweet potatoes = 10 * $2
Revenue from selling sweet potatoes = $20

Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling carrots.
Revenue from selling carrots = Number of carrots * Price per carrot
Revenue from selling carrots = 4 * $1.25
Revenue from selling carrots = $5

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling all crops.
Total revenue = Revenue from yams + Revenue from sweet potatoes + Revenue from carrots
Total revenue = $9 + $20 + $5
Total revenue = $24

{The final answer is: Jen will earn $24 if she sells everything.}</s>","Jen can earn $1.5 x 6 = $<<1.5*6=9>>9 for the yams.
She can earn $2 x 10 = $<<2*10=20>>20 for the sweet potatoes.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Marcus is half of Leo's age and is 5 years younger than Deanna. Let's represent Leo's age as L, Marcus' age as M, and Deanna's age as D.

2. According to the problem, Marcus is half of Leo's age: M = 0.5L

3. We also know that Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna: M = D - 5

4. Now we have two equations with two variables:

    M = 0.5L
    M = D - 5

5. To find the value of L (Leo's age), we need to solve these two equations simultaneously.

6. Substitute the first equation into the second equation:

    0.5L = D - 5

7. Solve for D in terms of L:

    D = 0.5L + 5

8. Now we know Deanna's age is a function of Leo's age, and Leo's age is given by Marcus' age in terms of Leo's age. We know Deanna's age is 26, so we can set up the equation:

    0.5L + 5 = 26

9. Subtract 5 from both sides:

    0.5L = 21

10. Divide both sides by 0.5 to find Leo's age:

    L = 42

So, {The final answer is Leo is 42 years old}.</s>","Marcus is 26 - 5 = <<26-5=21>>21 years old.

Step 2: Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A and the points scored by Dinar as D. According to the problem statement, we have:

Bahati's points = 45
Bahati's points > Azibo's points + 20
Bahati's points > Dinar's points + 10

Step 3: The second inequality gives us: Bahati's points > Azibo's points + 20 > Dinar's points + 10. In other words, Bahati scored more than Azibo and Dinar by at least 30 points.

Step 4: Since Bahati scored 45 points, and he scored 30 points more than Azibo and Dinar combined, the points scored by Azibo and Dinar together must be:

Total points for Azibo and Dinar = Bahati's points - Points difference
Total points for Azibo and Dinar = 45 - 30
Total points for Azibo and Dinar = 15

Step 5: To find the individual points for Azibo, we subtract Dinar's points from the total:

Azibo's points = Total points for Azibo and Dinar - Dinar's points
Azibo's points = 15 - Points scored by Dinar

Step 6: We do not have enough information to determine Dinar's points directly from the provided information. However, we know that Azibo scored less points than Bahati by 20 points and Dinar by 10 points. Since Bahati scored 45 points, Azibo's points must be less than 35 points.

Step 7: To find Azibo's points, we need to find Dinar's points that would make the difference between Bahati's (45) and Azibo's points less than or equal to 10.

Step 8: By trying different values for Dinar's points and calculating the difference between Bahati's (45) and Azibo's points, we find that when Dinar scores 5 points, the difference between Bahati's and Azibo's points is 10. Thus,

Azibo's points = Total points for Azibo and Dinar - Dinar's points = 15 - 5 = 10

The final answer is: Azibo scored 10 points.</s>","Let B = the number of points Bahati scored

Pages per inch = 100 pages / 1 inch = 100 pages per inch

Step 2: Calculate the number of pages in the book based on its thickness.
Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick:
Number of pages = Pages per inch * Thickness in inches
Number of pages = 100 pages per inch * 1.5 inches
Number of pages = 150 pages

Step 3: Consider the page count for both sides of each sheet.
Since each page is printed on one side only, we need to double the page count to account for both sides of the paper:

1. Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.
2. First, let's find out how many reports he can staple in one hour. We know there are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
   Reports per hour = Reports per 15 minutes * (Minutes per hour / Minutes per 15 minutes)
   = 30 reports * (60 minutes / 15 minutes)
   = 30 reports * 4
   = 120 reports
3. Now, let's calculate how many reports Vince can staple during the 13-hour period (from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM):

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. Therefore, her normal sleeping hours are: 
10 p.m. to 6 a.m. = 8 hours

However, on this particular day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her actual sleeping hours on this day would be:
10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. = 7 hours and 55 minutes

Step 2: calculating the duration of her sleepwalking episode.
The sleepwalking episode occurred between 2:15 a.m. and 2:38 a.m. Therefore, the duration of her sleepwalking episode is:
2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. = 23 minutes

Step 3: calculating the total minutes Kim spent in bed on this day.
To find out how many minutes Kim spent in bed on this day, we need to add her normal sleeping hours (7 hours and 55 minutes) to the duration of her sleepwalking episode (23 minutes):
Total minutes in bed = Normal sleeping hours + Sleepwalking episode duration
Total minutes in bed = 7 hours and 55 minutes + 23 minutes
Total minutes in bed = 458 minutes (approximately 7 hours and 38 minutes)

{The final answer is: Kim spent approximately 7 hours and 38 minutes in bed on this day.}</s>","Out of 24 hours in a day, 10 pm represents 22 hours.

                 [/INST] To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has, we first need to calculate the number of measuring spoons he originally had, and then add the number of spoons he gave to Pedro.

1. We know that Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. We are given that he has 48 cups, so:
   Measuring spoons = Number of cups * (2/3)
   = 48 * (2/3)
   = 32 * 2/3
   = 64 * (1/3)
   = 22.67(approximately) * Dozen
   Since we cannot have a fractional number of dozen, we can round this value up to 23 * Dozen.

   {The number of measuring spoons Jonathan originally had is approximately 23 * Dozens (79.2 * individually).}

2. Jonathan gave Pedro 6 measuring spoons. To find the number of spoons Pedro receives, we need to find the actual number of measuring spoons that correspond to 6 * Dozens, since we know that 1 Dozen = 12:
   Spoons given to Pedro = 6 * Dozens * Spoons per Dozen
   = 6 * 12 * 1
   = 72

3. To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has, we must add the original number of measuring spoons and the number of spoons given to Pedro:
   Total utensils = Measuring spoons originally + Spoons given to Pedro
   = 23 * Dozens * Spoons per Dozen + 72
   = 23 * 12 * 1 + 72
   = 1904 + 72
   = 1976

  {The final answer is 1976. Jonathan has a total of 1976 utensils (approximately).}</s>","A dozen measuring cups are 12, and if Jonathan has two dozens, he has 2*12 = 24 cups.
Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, so he has 2/3*24 = <<2/3*24=16>>16 measuring spoons.
When he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he remains with 16-6 = <<16-6=10>>10 measuring spoons.
He now has a total of 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = <<10+24=34>>34 utensils

- The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
- So, the number of occupied beds is: 1000 * (1/5) = 2000/5 = 400 beds.

Step 2: Calculate the number of new patients admitted during these 2 weeks.
- Each day, 50 new patients are admitted.
- Over 2 weeks (14 days), the number of new patients is: 50 * 14 = 700 new patients.

Step 3: Determine the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.
- Initially, there are 400 occupied beds.
- After admitting 700 new patients, the number of occupied beds is: 400 + 700 = 1100.

Step 4: Calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.
- The total number of beds is 1000, so after 2 weeks, there are: 1000 - 1100 (which is a negative number, so we take its absolute value) = 1000 - (-1100) = 2100 beds in total.
- The number of occupied beds is 1100, so the number of unoccupied beds is: 2100 - 1100 = {The final answer is 1000}.</s>","If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.
If 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.
After two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.

                    question:
                    Robyn sends sixteen emails ! a : day. Seven are work emails, ; and two-thirds , of the remainder are , to family. One-third of ! the other , emails are to her boyfriend. ! How many emails a ! day does she send . to ; her boyfriend?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Robyn sends a total of sixteen emails per day.
2. Seven of these emails are work emails.
3. The remaining emails are either to family or to her boyfriend.
4. Two-thirds of the remaining emails are to family.
5. One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend.

Let's first find out how many emails are sent to family and to her boyfriend together. We know that two-thirds of the remaining emails are to family, so:

Number of emails to family = Total remaining emails * 2/3
= 16 * 2/3
= 11.33 (Since we can't have a fraction of an email, we'll round down to 11)

Now, one-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend:

Number of emails to her boyfriend = Total remaining emails * 1/3
= 16 * 1/3
= 5.33 (Again, we can't have a fraction of an email, so we'll round down to 5)

To find the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend per day, add the number of work emails and the number of emails to family, then subtract that sum from the total number of emails she sends:

Total number of emails = Work emails + Emails to family + Emails to boyfriend
= 7 + 11 + 5
= 13

So, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend per day is:

Emails to her boyfriend = Total number of emails - Work emails - Emails to family
= 13 - 7 - 11
= 0

However, since she's sending a total of 16 emails per day, and we found 13 emails being accounted for, that leaves one email unaccounted for. That missing email should also be accounted for as part of her emails to family or boyfriend, but the given information doesn't provide enough detail to determine which.

Therefore, based on the given information, we can only determine that Robyn sends between 4 and 5 emails to her boyfriend per day, but we can't be certain of the exact number {The final answer is: between 4 and 5 emails per day}.</s>","Robyn sends 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 non-work emails.
She sends 9 * 2 / 3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 emails to family.
There are 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 emails remaining.
Of the remaining 3, 1/3 are to her boyfriend, so Robyn sends him 3 * 1 / 3 = <<3*1/3=1>>1 email a day.

Let X be the current age of Shawna.
Let Y be the age of Shawna's father.
Let Z be the age of Aliya.

According to the problem:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so Y = 5X.
2. Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, so X = 3Z.
3. Aliya is 3 years old, so Z = 3.

Now, we have two equations with our two variables X and Y and can solve this system of equations:

From the second equation, we have X = 3Z.
Substituting X = 3Z into Y = 5X,

Y = 5X = 5(3Z) = 15Z.

Therefore, Shawna's father's age is 15 times the age of Aliya. So,

{The final answer is 15 times the age of Aliya.}

If Aliya is 3 years old, then:

If Kelly was right, how many people : really attended ? the concert?
                 [/INST] Step 1: We start with the information given that Courtney reported there were 48 people at the concert.

Step 2: Kelly claimed that Courtney had overstated the number of people in attendance by 20%. This means that the actual number of people at the concert was 20% less than the number Courtney reported.

Step 3: To find the actual number of people at the concert, we need to subtract 20% of the number Courtney reported from that number.

Step 4: First, we calculate 20% of 48. To do this, we find 20% of 1 (which is 0.2), and then multiply it by 48.

20% of 48 = 0.2 x 48 = 9.6, which we can round up to 10

Step 5: Now, we subtract this number from the number Courtney reported.

Actual number of people at the concert = 48 - 10 = 38

{The final answer is: 38 people attended the concert.}</s>","Since she overstated the number by 20%, 48 is 20% greater than the actual number i.e. 48 = 100% + 20% = 120% of the actual number = 120/100 of the actual number
Therefore, the actual number = (100/120)*48 = <<(100/120)*48=40>>40

                 [/INST] To find the total number of balls the coach brought to practice, we need to use the information given about the number of balls carried by each boy in one trip and the number of balls carried by Jason in relation to Jason and Jeffrey.

Let's assign a variable X to represent the number of balls carried by Jason in one trip, and according to the problem, Jordan carries twice as many balls as Jason and Jeffrey carries half as many balls as Jason. So, Jordan carries 2X balls and Jeffrey carries X/2 balls.

We know that the three boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, so the total number of balls, which we will denote as Y, is equal to the sum of balls carried by each boy:

Y = X (Jason's balls) + X (Jason's balls) + X/2 (Jeffrey's balls)

Since we also know that Jason carried 2 balls initially, we can set up an equation to find X:

X + X + X/2 = Y - (2 balls Jason initially picked up)

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3X = 2Y - 4

Solving for X:

X = 2Y/3 - 4/3

Now, since Jason carried 2 balls initially, we can find the total number of balls by setting X = 2 in the previous equation:

Y = 3X + 4
Y = 3(2) + 4
Y = 6 + 4
Y = 10

However, since Jason picked up 2 balls initially and the boys picked up all the balls in one trip, we have to add those 2 balls back to the total number of balls:

The final answer is: The coach brought 12 basketballs to practice.</s>","Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 balls.
Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 ball.
In total, the three boys carried 4+2+1=<<4+2+1=7>>7 balls, which were all the balls the coach brought to practice.

                 [/INST] To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure, we first need to determine the total number of holes dug before that day.

1. The pirates dug ten holes on the first day.
2. They dug thirteen holes on the second day, so the total number of holes dug through the second day is 10 (first day) + 13 (second day) = <<10+13=23>>23 holes.
3. They dug eight holes on the third day, so the total number of holes dug through the third day is 23 (previous days) + 8 (third day) = <<23+8=31>>31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes as at the end of the first day by the fourth day, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

31 (total holes) = 4 * x (holes at end of first day)

We know that there were ten holes at the end of the first day, so we can find the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:

x = 10 (holes at end of first day)
31 = 4 * 10
x = 31 (holes at end of fourth day)

Now, we can find the number of holes dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure by subtracting the number of holes dug up to that point from the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day:

Holes dug on fourth day before treasure = 31 (holes at end of fourth day) - 3 (holes dug to fill in) - 1 (treasure chest)

Therefore, the answer is: The pirates dug 27 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure. (Note: It's important to double-check the calculations and ensure all information is correct before accepting this answer as the final solution.)</s>","Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.
The island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.
They dug 10 + 13 + 8 = <<10+13+8=31>>31 holes the first three days.
After filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.
When they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.
Thus, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes on the fourth day.

1. We know that Amora and Lainey will get equal amounts of corn chips, but there will be one extra person (Collins) who will receive 15 more chips than they get.
2. Amora and Lainey each get 70 corn chips.
3. Let's denote the number of corn chips for Collins as ""x"".
4. According to the problem, Collins will receive 15 more corn chips than Amora and Lainey: x = 70 + 15.
5. We can simplify the equation to x = 85.

6. Now we have the total number of corn chips for all three people: Corn chips for Amora and Lainey = 2 * 70 = 140. Corn chips for Collins = 85.
7. So the total amount of corn chips needed is 140 + 85 = 225.

{The final answer is: 225 corn chips were needed for an equal distribution among Amora, Lainey, and Collins with the given conditions.}</s>","If Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, they received a total of 70*2 = <<70*2=140>>140 corn chips.

                 [/INST] Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan, so the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:
   Stan's catch count = Alex's catch count - 5
2. We also know that Stan has caught 13 less Pokemon than 4 times the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught, which can be written as:
   4 * Adelwolfe's catch count - 13 = Stan's catch count
3. Now we have two equations with two variables. To find the value of one variable, we need to find the value of the other variable first.
4. The problem gives us the total number of Pokemon they have all caught together, which is:
   Total catch count = Alex's catch count + Stan's catch count + Adelwolfe's catch count
5. From the information provided, we don't have enough information to find the exact number of Pokemon Alex and Adelwolfe have caught, but we do know that their combined catch count is more than Stan's catch count and that the total catch count is 339. Therefore, the only possible way for this to be true is if Stan's catch count represents the majority of the total catch count.
6. If we assume that Stan's catch count is 339, then Alex and Adelwolfe together have caught 339 - Stan's catch count = 0 Pokemon.
7. However, this assumption does not fulfill the condition given that their total catch count is more than Stan's catch count.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the given information. John has started watching a new show. Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

Step 2: Determine the number of episodes. Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can write this relationship as: number of episodes = total minutes / 2.

Step 3: Find the total minutes spent watching the show. We can calculate this by finding the product of the length of each episode (20 minutes) and the number of episodes.

First, find the number of episodes:
number of episodes = total minutes / 2

Let X represent the total minutes of the show. Then, the number of episodes is X / 2.

Now, find the total minutes spent watching the show:
total minutes spent = number of episodes * minutes per episode

                             = X

Therefore, John will spend X minutes watching the show. To find the actual value, we need to know the total number of minutes in the show. For example, if there are 20 episodes (total minutes = 20 * 20 = 400 minutes), then John will spend 400 minutes watching the show.

{The final answer is: X minutes, where X is the total number of minutes in the show}</s>","Since there are half as many episodes as the number of minutes per episode, we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 episodes in total.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's calculate the number of brownies Greta made for herself.
She made a batch of cream cheese swirl brownies, with each batch making a dozen brownies.
So, Greta made 1 dozen brownies for herself.

Step 2: Now let's find out how many brownies Greta received from her office party.
The office party sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.
So, Greta had 1/2 * 12 = 6 brownies from the office party.

Step 3: Let's calculate the number of brownies Greta received from her surprise party at home.
Greta had 4 dozens brownies waiting for her at her surprise party.
So, she had 4 * 12 = 48 brownies from her friends.

Step 4: During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
So, 1 1/2 * 12 = 18 brownies were eaten.

Step 5: Let's find out how many brownies Greta had left after the entire day.
Greta made 12 brownies for herself, received 6 brownies from her office party, and had 48 brownies from her surprise party. After eating 18 brownies during the party, she had Greta's total = 12 (for herself) + 6 (office) + 48 (surprise) - 18 (eaten at the party) = 62 brownies

{The final answer is 62 individual brownies left over for Greta.}</s>","Her office sent her home with a 1/2 dozen brownies so she had 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 individual brownies

Step 2: We're told that Nani's brother is twice his age. So, Nani's brother is 8 years old + (2 * 8) = 24 years old.

Step 3: We're also told that Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. Nani is 8 years old, so Nani's sister is 8 years old - (0.25 * 8) = 6 years old.

Step 4: To find the total age of all three family members, we add up their ages: 8 (Nani) + 24 (Nani's brother) + 6 (Nani's sister) = 38 years old.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes Andy to string all the racquets, we need to find the total number of minutes it takes to string each type of racquet and add them together.

First, let's find out how many racquets of each type there are:
- Synthetic gut: 3
- Polyester: 5
- Hybrid: 4

Next, we'll calculate the total number of minutes it takes Andy to string all the racquets:

1. Synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
2. Polyester: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
3. Hybrid: 4 racquets * (18 minutes/racquet + 18 minutes/racquet) = 4 * 36 = 144 minutes (since it takes 18 minutes for each half of the hybrid set)

Now, let's add up the total number of minutes: 45 minutes (synthetic gut) + 110 minutes (polyester) + 144 minutes (hybrid) = ≤ 299 minutes

The final answer is: It takes Andy a total of 299 minutes to string all 12 racquets.</s>","Andy is stringing 3 racquets with synthetic gut, so those will take 3 synthetic gut jobs * 15 minutes per synthetic gut job = <<3*15=45>>45 minutes.

Next, let's determine the price of each phone after the first one. We're told that each phone after the first two is half price. So, the price of the second phone is $600/2 = $300.

The third phone will cost $300/2 = $150. Therefore, the price of each phone after the first two is half the price of the previous one.

To calculate the total cost, we'll find the price of all five phones, John, his two kids', and his wife's phones:

1 phone at $600
2 phones at $300 each = $600
1 phone at $150

The fence is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide.

Step 2: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle to find the total length of fencing that needs to be built.
The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).
So, the perimeter of the fence is 2 * (15 ft + 10 ft).

Step 3: Simplify the equation.
Perimeter = 2 * (15 ft + 10 ft)
Perimeter = 2 * (25 ft)
Perimeter = 50 ft

Step 4: Calculate how many slats are needed for each foot of fencing.
Robert needs 2 slats for every foot of fencing.

Step 5: Multiply the number of slats needed per foot by the total length of the fence to find the number of slats Robert will need.
Number of slats = (slats per foot) * (total length of fence)

Step 6: Perform the multiplication.
Number of slats = 2 slats/ft * 50 ft

                 [/INST] To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, let's first calculate the number of oranges she kept for herself and sold:

1. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So she had 12 * 20 = <<12*20=240>>240 oranges in total.
2. She gave 2 boxes each to her mom and sister, which is a total of 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 boxes. So she gave away 2 * 2 * 20 = <<2*2*20=80>>80 oranges.
3. She kept 1/4 of the oranges for herself, which is 1/4 * 240 = <<1/4*240=60>>60 oranges.
4. Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is the total number of oranges she bought minus the number of oranges she gave to her family and kept for herself: 240 - 80 - 60 = <<240-80-60=96>>96 oranges.

                 [/INST] Let's go through the steps to find the answer:

1. We know that Richard, Jerry, and Robert are sharing 60 cherries in total. Let's represent the number of cherries each person has as follows: R = Richard's cherries, J = Jerry's cherries, and C = Robert's cherries.
2. We know that R + J + C = 60.
3. We also know that Robert has 30 cherries more than Richard, so C = R + 30.
4. We don't have any information about Jerry's share of cherries, but we do know that the difference between Robert's and Richard's shares is 30. So we want to find the difference between Robert's and Jerry's shares.
5. Let's first find the number of cherries that Jerry has: J = 60 - (R + C) = 60 - (R + (R + 30)) = 60 - 2R - 30 = 40 - R
6. Now, let's find the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries: C - J = (R + 30) - (40 - R) = R + 30 - 40 + R = 2R + 30
7. We wanted to find the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries, which is 2R + 30.

The final answer is {2R + 30}.

Note: The exact number of cherries each person has cannot be determined without more information, but the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries is 2R + 30.</s>","Since Robert has 30, then 60 - 30 = <<30=30>>30 cherries are left to be shared by Richard and Jerry.
Richard has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 cherries since Robert has 10 more cherries than him.
Jerry has 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 cherries.

If ! the ; gingerbread ! cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, ; how much did ; Sunny earn for ? two ? days?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the number of boxes sold for each type of dessert on both days.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 more boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Let X be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday. Then, Sunny sold (X + 10) boxes of gingerbread on Saturday and Y boxes of apple pie on Sunday. Since he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday, we have Y = X - 4.

Step 2: Find the relationship between the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold.

Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread and 15 more boxes of apple pie on Sunday than on Saturday. We can write this as:

(X + 10) = X + 5 (gingerbread)
Y = X - 4 (apple pie)
Y = X + 15 (apple pie, on Sunday)

Step 3: Solve the system of equations to find the number of boxes sold on both days.

Subtracting Y from the expression for the number of apple pies sold on Sunday, we have X + 15 = X + 19, which means X = 4. Substituting X = 4 into the equation for the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday, we have X + 10 = 4 + 5 = 9. So, Sunny sold 9 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday and 11 boxes on Saturday (9 + 10 - 1).

Step 4: Calculate the revenue earned from selling gingerbread and apple pie on each day.

The cost of gingerbread is $6 per box, so Sunny earned $6 * 9 = $54 for gingerbread on Sunday. He sold 1 more box on Saturday, so he earned $56 for gingerbread on that day.

The cost of apple pie is $15 per box, so Sunny earned $15 * 4 = $60 for apple pie on Sunday. He sold 15 more boxes on Saturday, so he earned $15 * 19 = $285 for apple pie on that day.

Step 5: Find the total revenue earned for the two days.

Sunny earned $54 + $56 = $110 for gingerbread and $60 + $285 = $345 for apple pie, so he earned a total of $110 + $345 = $455 for both days.

{The final answer is $455.}

Therefore, Sunny earned a total of $455 from selling gingerbread and apple pie over the two days.</s>","He sold 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.
The total number of boxes of gingerbread that Sunny sold is 10 + 15 = <<10+15=25>>25.
Sunny earned 25 x $6 = $<<25*6=150>>150 for selling gingerbread.
He sold 15 - 4 = <<15-4=11>>11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.
The total number of boxes of apple pie that Sunny sold is 15 + 11 = <<15+11=26>>26.
He earned 26 x $15 = $<<26*15=390>>390 for selling apple pie.
So, Sunny earned $150 + $390 = $<<150+390=540>>540 for two days.

                 [/INST] To find the cost of both cars, we first need to determine the cost of the red car. We know that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, whose price is given as $100.

To find the cost of the red car, we'll decreases the price of the blue car by 40%:

Price of red car = Price of blue car * (1 - Percentage difference / 100)
Price of red car = $100 * (1 - 40/100)
Price of red car = $100 * (0.6)
Price of red car = $60

Now that we have the cost of the red car, we can add it to the cost of the blue car to find the total cost of both cars:

Total cost = Cost of blue car + Cost of red car
Total cost = $100 + $60
Total cost = $160

{The final answer is: $160}</s>","The red car is 40/100 * 100 = $<<40/100*100=40>>40 cheaper than the blue car.
That means, that the red car costs 100 - 40 = $<<100-40=60>>60.
So both cars cost 100 + 60 = $<<100+60=160>>160.

                 [/INST] Let's call the age of Emil's father ""F"" and the age of Emil's brother ""B"". We're given that Emil is currently 19 years old and that when Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his father but twice the age of his brother.

First, we need to find out the age of Emil's father when Emil is 24. We know that at that time, Emil will be half the age of his father, so:

F = 24 + (0.5 * F)

Subtracting 0.5F from both sides, we get F = 48 + 0.5F

Next, we need to find the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24. We're given that at that time, Emil will be twice the age of his brother, so:

B = 24 / 2 = 12

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of Emil's father and brother right now. Since Emil is currently 19 and will be 24 in the future when these age relationships hold true:

F + B = F + 12

To find F, we can use the relationship we derived earlier:

F = 48 + 0.5F

To find a unique solution, we'll use guess-and-check. Let's assume F = 72:

72 + 12 = 84

The difference between Emil's age (19) and the sum of the father's and brother's ages (84) does not match the problem statement. Therefore, our initial assumption of F = 72 is not correct. We need to adjust the father's age until we find the correct sum.

Let's try F = 64:

64 + 12 = 76

The difference between Emil's age (19) and the ages of his father (64) and brother (12) is 81 in total. Let's check if that matches a combination of whole number ages for father and brother that work:

Emil's age: 19
Father's age: 64
Brother's age: 12

Sum of their ages: 64 + 12 = 76
Difference between Emil's age and their sum: 81 = (19 - 11) + (19 - 5)

The difference (81) matches the difference between Emil's age and the sum of the father's and brother's ages, so the solution is correct.

Therefore, {The final answer is: Emil's father is currently 64 years old, and Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.}</s>","His dad will be 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 years old when Emil is 24.

The total weight of crawfish Joe caught is the sum of the weights on each day: 3 pounds (Thursday) + 12 pounds (Friday) + 6 pounds (Saturday). So, he caught <|3+12+6=21|>21 pounds in total.

Step 3: Convert the total weight to servings.

One serving is defined as 3 pounds. To find the number of servings, divide the total weight (in pounds) by the weight per serving (in pounds). So, there are <|21/3=7|>7 servings in total.

1. Size of Sophie's boots = x
2. Size of Charlie's boots = 5 * Size of Sophie's boots = 5x

Now we need to find the sum of the sizes of both pairs of shoes to find the average:

1. Sum of shoe sizes = Size of Sophie's shoes + Size of Charlie's shoes
2. Sum of shoe sizes = x + 5x = 6x

To find the average size of the shoes, we need to divide the sum of their sizes by the total number of people:

1. Average size of shoes = Sum of shoe sizes / Number of people
2. Average size of shoes = 6x / 2

Since there are only two people in this problem, we can simplify the equation:

1. Average size of shoes = 3x

We don't have a value for x yet, but we know that x represents the size of Sophie's shoes. With the given information, we can express Charlie's shoe size as a multiple of Sophie's size. Therefore, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 3 times the size of Sophie's shoes.

The flower bed is 111 feet long. With each plant having a space of 1.5 feet around it, we can calculate the number of plants as follows:
Number of flowers = Total length of the flower bed / Space between plants
Number of flowers = 111 ft / 1.5 ft = 74.067 ≈ 75 (Since we cannot have a fraction of a plant)

Step 2: Calculate the number of flowers Pat will have in total.
Pat already owns 17 flowers. So, the number of flowers she needs to buy is:
Number of flowers to buy = Number of flowers in total - Number of flowers she already has
Number of flowers to buy = 75 - 17 = 58

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the flowers.
Cost of one flower = $6

- She sets aside 25% of her monthly paycheck for shoes.
- Her monthly paycheck is $2,000.00.
- So, the amount she saves each month for shoes is (0.25) * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Step 2: Calculate how many shoes she can buy in a month.
- The cost of each pair of shoes is $1,000.00.
- So, she can buy one pair of shoes every month with her savings.

Step 3: Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- So, she can buy 12 pairs of shoes in a year with her savings.

{The final answer is: Jessica can buy 12 pairs of shoes in a year.}</s>","She is paid $2,000.00 a month and she saves 25% for shoes so she saves 2000*.25 = $<<2000*.25=500.00>>500.00

1. Emily can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute. Therefore, it takes her 1 minute to peel 6 shrimp. To peel 90 shrimp, it will take: {1 minute * (90 / 6) = 15 minutes}.

2. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To cook 90 shrimp, she will need to cook 3 batches (since she can cook 30 shrimp in one batch). It takes her 10 minutes to cook one batch, so it will take: {10 minutes * 3 = 30 minutes} to cook all 90 shrimp.

3. Since Emily first needs to peel the shrimp and then cook them, the total time for her to peel and cook 90 shrimp will be the sum of the time it takes her to peel them and the time it takes her to cook them: {15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes}.

{The final answer is: It will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.}</s>","First find how long it takes Emily to peel the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes
Then find how many batches of shrimp she needs to cook: 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp/batch = <<90/30=3>>3 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 10 minutes/batch = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes

                 [/INST] To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature due to the air conditioner and the room warming up.

First, let's find the temperature change during each mode of the air conditioner.

1. The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour on low. So, in 3 hours, it cools the room by: 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees

2. The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour on high. So, in 4 hours, it cools the room by: 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees

3. The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner running. So, during the 2 hours it was off, the room warmed up by: 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, let's find the net change in temperature:

- The air conditioner cooled the room by 6 degrees on low and 12 degrees on high, for a total of: 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees
- The room warmed up by 4 degrees while the air conditioner was off

So, the final temperature is 18 degrees lower than the starting temperature (before the air conditioner was turned on):

{The final answer is: The final temperature is 18 degrees below the starting temperature.}</s>","The air conditioner ran for 3 hours on low, so the temperature dropped 2 * 3 = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees.
It then ran for 4 hours on high, so the temperature dropped another 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 degrees.
It was then turned off for 2 hours, so the temperature rose 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 degrees.
Thus, the final temperature was 6 + 12 - 4 = <<6+12-4=14>>14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Step 2: Bill's father saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.

Step 3: Bill saw the Comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it. So, Bill was 3 * (30) = 90 years old when he saw the Comet the second time.

Step 4: We want to find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time. We know that the time between the two observations is the orbital period of the Comet, which is 75 years.

Step 5: Since Bill saw the Comet 90 years after his father's observation, the first observation must have been 90 - 75 = 15 years earlier than his father's.

Step 6: Therefore, Bill was 30 - 15 = 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

How many flights to France does the first plane ; take ? in : one ! day?
                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as X. Then the number of flights to Greece is 3/4 * X.
2. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and Germany. Let's denote the number of flights to each country as Y (France) and Z (Germany), respectively. Since the remaining flights are split equally, we have Y = Z.
3. We're given that the number of flights to Germany is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. So, Z = 1/2 * X.
4. We also know that the number of flights to Poland by the second plane is 44 and it is half the number of flights the first plane makes. So, X = 2 * (Greece + France + Germany) = 2 * (3/4 * X + Y + Y), where Y = Z.
5. Solving the equation 2 * X = 2 * (3/4 * X + 2 * Y), we can separate the variables: X = 4 * (3/4) * X + 4 * Y.
6. Dividing X by 4 and solving for X, we get X = 3 * (3/4) * X + 4 * Y.
7. Substituting X = 4 * (Greece + France + Germany), we have 3 * (3/4) * (4 * (Greece + France + Germany)) + 4 * Y = X.
8. Simplifying the equation, 3 * (Greece + France + Germany) = 4 * Y.
9. Dividing both sides by 3, we get Greece + France + Germany = 4/3 * Y. Since France and Germany have equal number of flights, we have Y = France = Z. So, Greece + 2 * France = 4/3 * Y.
10. Finally, we can express Greece + 2 * France as a fraction of the total number of flights X: Greece + 2 * France = (1/2) * X.
11. Substituting Greece + 2 * France = 3/4 * X into the equation we derived earlier (Greece + 2 * France = 4/3 * Y), we get 3/4 * X = 4/3 * 1/2 * X. Solving for X, we find that X = 24, 12 of which are flights to Greece.
12. Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, we have half of the remaining flights going to each country. So, the number of flights to France ishalf of the total number of flights to Greece and Poland, which is half of X: France = 1/2 * X = 1/2 * 24 = 12.

{The final answer is: The first plane takes 12 flights to France in one day.}</s>","The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = <<44*2=88>>88 flights a day.
If 3/4 of the first plane’s flights are to Greece, then flights to France or Germany make up 1 – 3/4 = 1/4 of the total daily flights.
Therefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 flights to France or Germany.
Splitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 flights to France in one day.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find the length of time that each wolf howls for. We are given that Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Step 2: Chikote's howl lasts for twice as long as Tobias', so its length is 20 seconds × 2 = 40 seconds.

Step 3: Igneous's howl lasts for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

Step 4: To get the combined length of time in minutes, we need to convert all lengths to minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we have:

20 seconds (Tobias) → 0.333 minutes (20∕60)
40 seconds (Chikote) → 0.667 minutes (40∕60)
60 seconds (Igneous) → 1 minute

Step 5: Now, we simply add up the lengths to get the combined time in minutes: 0.333 minutes + 0.667 minutes + 1 minute = 1.66 minutes.

The final answer is: The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 1.66 minutes.</s>","Chikote howls for 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seconds.

In total, the combined length of time, in seconds, of the three wolves' howls is 20+40+60=<<20+40+60=120>>120 seconds.
Thus, the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 minutes.

Step 2: Find the total amount of money Adam received from both parents.
Total amount = $6 (from mother) + $12 (from father) = $18

Step 3: Determine the amount of money Adam spent on the trousers.
Adam spent: $30

Step 4: Find the difference between the amount of money Adam received and the amount he spent.
Money difference = $18 (received) - $30 (spent) = -$12

However, the problem states ""HOW MUCH MONEY DID ADAM HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE FROM HIS SAVINGS?"" This implies that the difference should be a positive number, meaning Adam had to contribute money from his savings.

Since the current calculation results in a negative number, this answer is incorrect. Instead, we'll calculate how much money Adam needed from his savings by finding the difference between the amount he spent ($30) and the amount his parents gave him ($18).

Step 5: Find the difference between the amount Adam spent and the amount he received from both parents.

If Akbar , is , 3 ! years old : and Alessandro is 4 years old, calculate the age of Wilfred.
                 [/INST] Let's first find the average age of the four children:
1. We know that the total age of the four children is 20, and there are four children (Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred).
2. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let H be Helene's age and x be the average age.
3. We can write this relationship as H = 2x.
4. The sum of the ages of all four children is 20: Akbar (A) = 3X, Alessandro (S) = 4, Helene (H) = 2x, and Wilfred's age (W) we want to find. So, the equation for the total age is A + S + H + W = 20.

Now let's solve for Wilfred's age:

1. Substitute Akbar's age, Alessandro's age, and Helene's relationship to the average age into the total age equation: 3X + 4 + 2x + W = 20.
2. Combine like terms: 4X + x + W = 16.
3. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can express x in terms of Helene's age: x = H/2.
4. Substitute H = 2x from the Helene-Average Age relationship into x = H/2: x = (2x)/2 = x. So, x = 2x/2 = x = H/2.
5. Substitute x = H/2 back into the total age equation: 4X + x + W = 16 becomes 4X + H/2 + W = 16.
6. Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 8X + H + 2W = 32.
7. Substitute H = 2x back into the equation: 8X + 2x + 2W = 32.
8. Factor out the common term, 2X: 8X + 2X + 2W = 32 becomes 10X + 2W = 32.
9. To solve for Wilfred's age (W), we need an equation with only W. Subtract 10X from both sides to get 2W = 22.
10. Divide both sides by 2 to find Wilfred's age: W = 11.

{The final answer is: Wilfred is 11 years old.}</s>","If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.
Helene is twice as old as the group's average age, meaning Helene is 2 * 5 years = <<2*5=10>>10 years old.
The total age of the three children is 10 years + 3 years + 4 years = <<10+3+4=17>>17 years.
Wilfred's age is 20 years - 17 years = <<20-17=3>>3 years.

Total amount = $500 (from neighbors) + $1500 (from online fund) = $2000

Now, according to the question, Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else has donated, plus the extra $200 Walter wants. Let's call the amount of money every other person has donated ""x"".

Lawyer's contribution = 3x + $200

Since we know that Walter has collected a total of $2000, and we assume there are n people (excluding Walter himself) who have donated:

Total amount = x (for everyone else) + $2000 (for Walter)

We can find the value of x by subtracting the amount Walter collected from his neighbors from the total amount:

x = Total amount -Amount from neighbors = $2000 - $500 = $1950

Now we know that the lawyer's contribution is 3x + $200, so:

Lawyer's contribution = 3($1950) + $200 = $5852

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception.
100 guests = number of guests
15 cookies/guest = number of cookies per guest
100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Step 2: Determine the number of cookies given to the church.
1/2 of the cookies = shared with the church
1500 cookies * 1/2 = 750 cookies

Step 3: Find the number of people in the church if each person gets 15 cookies.
750 cookies = number of cookies
15 cookies/person = number of cookies per person
750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 persons

                    : A ? family of 6 (2 adults and 4 ? kids) ? are to : divide a : watermelon such that each adult gets a slice ! that is twice as big as that of each : kid. What , percentage of . the watermelon does each : adult . get?
                 [/INST] To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we first need to determine how many slices the adults and kids get. We know that there are 2 adults and 4 kids in the family.

1. First, let's find out how many slices the kids get:
   - Each kid gets one slice.
   - So, there are 4 kids in total, so they get 4 slices.

2. Next, let's find out how many slices the adults get:
   - Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as a kid's slice.
   - Since kids get one slice each, an adult gets a slice that is 2 * 1 = 2 kid slices.
   - So, there are 2 adults in total, so they get 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

3. We now know that there are a total of 4 (kid slices) + 4 (adult slices) = 8 slices. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to determine their share in terms of weight.

4. Let's assume that the entire watermelon (W) is represented by 100 units (for simplicity). Each kid slice represents 'k' units of weight, and each adult slice represents '2k' units of weight. Since there are 8 slices in total, the total weight of the watermelon is 100 units.

5. The total weight of kid slices is 4 kid slices * 'k' units/slice = 4k units.
    The total weight of adult slices is 4 adult slices * '2k' units/slice = 8k units.

6. To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we can subtract the weight of kid slices from the total weight of the watermelon and then divide the weight of adult slices by the total weight of the watermelon. {The final answer is (8k / 100)} * 100% = 8k% for each adult.</s>","Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.
Since each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon
So the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage
The percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)
x = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the time Doctor Jones spends on rounds and appointments.
Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients. It takes 20 minutes to check each inpatient. Therefore, the time spent on rounds is 9 * 20 = 180 minutes or 3 hours.
Doctor Jones has 10 appointments. Each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the time spent on appointments is 10 * 30 = 300 minutes or 5 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends at the clinic.
Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Therefore, the total time spent at the clinic is 9 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 540 minutes or 9 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining time Doctor Jones has.
Doctor Jones spends 3 hours on rounds and 5 hours on appointments. Therefore, the total time spent on rounds and appointments is 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.
The total time Doctor Jones spends at the clinic is 9 hours. Therefore, the remaining time Doctor Jones has is 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour or 60 minutes.

{The final answer is: Doctor Jones has 1 hour or 60 minutes left to update his records.}</s>","Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients, so his rounds will take 9 * 20 = <<9*20=180>>180 minutes.

The rounds and appointments will take 180 + 300 = <<180+300=480>>480 minutes total.
An hour is 60 minutes, so rounds and appointments will take 480 / 60 = <<480/60=8>>8 hours.

                 [/INST] To find out the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to serve it at 5:00 pm, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake, including baking, cooling, and frosting.

First, let's find the time required to make the cake batter and bake the cake:
- Cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking: 30 minutes

Next, let's find the time required to cool and frost the cake:
- Cooling: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting: 10 minutes

Now, we can add up all the times to find out the total time required to make the cake, from start to finish:

Total time = Time to make cake batter and bake cake + Time to cool + Time to frost
Total time = 20 minutes (batter) + 30 minutes (bake) + 120 minutes (cool) + 10 minutes (frost)

Total time = 170 minutes

Finally, to find the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to serve it at 5:00 pm, we need to calculate how many minutes there are in the day and subtract the total time required to make the cake from that number:

Minutes in a day = 24 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes

Latest start time = Total time - Remaining minutes in the day
Latest start time = 170 minutes - (1440 minutes - 5:00 pm * 60 minutes/hour)

Using a calculator or conversion tables, we can find that 5:00 pm is 1700 minutes. Subtracting 1700 minutes from 1440 minutes, we get 740 minutes.

Latest start time = 170 minutes - 740 minutes

Latest start time = -570 minutes

Since the time cannot be negative, this calculation is incorrect. The given time requirements cannot be met in a single day, and Jordan will not be able to surprise her mom with a homemade cake that day and serve it at 5:00 pm.

{The final answer is: It is not possible to make the cake and serve it at 5:00 pm on the same day.}</s>","1 hour is 60 minutes so we know that 2 hours to cool the cake is the same as 2*60 so <<2*60=120>>120 min
It will take Jordan 20 min to make the batter, 30 to bake, 120 to cool and 10 to frost so the cake will take 20 +30 +120 +10 = <<20+30+120+10=180>>180 minutes total
Jordan needs to convert 180 minutes to hours so 180/60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours
If the cake needs to be finished by 5:00 pm and it will take 3 hours total to make then 5-3 = <<5-3=2>>2:00 pm is the latest she can start making the cake

                    question:
                    Lisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars door to door. ! Lisa sold three and ? a ; half ! boxes of chocolate bars, and . Peter , sold four and . a half ! boxes. They : sold 64 , chocolate bars , together. ! How many chocolate bars are in a box?
                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many chocolate bars Lisa and Peter sold in total, and then use that information to determine the number of chocolate bars in a box.

1. Lisa sold 3 full boxes and gave away half a box, so she sold:
   - 3 full boxes = 3 x number_of_bars_per_box
   - half a box = number_of_bars_per_box / 2
2. Peter sold 4 full boxes and gave away half a box, so he sold:
   - 4 full boxes = 4 x number_of_bars_per_box
   - half a box = number_of_bars_per_box / 2
3. Together they sold:
   - 3 x number_of_bars_per_box + 3 x number_of_bars_per_box / 2 + 4 x number_of_bars_per_box + 4 x number_of_bars_per_box / 2
   - Simplifying the equation: 10 x number_of_bars_per_box + 2 x number_of_bars_per_box / 2
   - 12 x number_of_bars_per_box + number_of_bars_per_box

4. We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars:
   - 12 x number_of_bars_per_box + number_of_bars_per_box = 64
   - 13 x number_of_bars_per_box = 64
   - number_of_bars_per_box = 64 / 13 ≈ 5

Since Lisa and Peter sold approximately 5 x 13 = 65 chocolate bars together (rounding up one bar from Lisa's half box), it's unlikely that each box contains exactly 5 chocolate bars. However, based on the given information, the closest number we can determine is {approximately 5 chocolate bars per box}.</s>","Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.
Lisa sold 3 1/2 * B bars.
Peter sold 4 1/2 * B bars.
Together, they sold 3 1/2 * B + 4 1/2 * B = 8B = 64 bars.
Therefore, there are B = 64 / 8 = <<64/8=8>>8 chocolate bars in a box.

                 [/INST] To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the revenue from renting the studio and the revenue from teaching students, and then add these two revenues together.

First, let's calculate the revenue from renting the studio:
The studio is rented 3 days a week, and each rental costs $25.
Revenue from renting the studio per week = $25
Since there are 4 weeks in a month,
Revenue from renting the studio per month = $25 x 4 = $100

Next, let's calculate the revenue from teaching students:
There are 10 students, and each student costs $1.50 per session.
Revenue from teaching students per session = $1.50 per student x 10 students = $15
Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are 4 sessions per day (morning and afternoon sessions),
Number of sessions taught per week = 3 days x 4 sessions/day = 12 sessions
Revenue from teaching students per week = $15 per session x 12 sessions = $180
Revenue from teaching students per month = $180 x 4 weeks = $720

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are the sum of the revenues from renting the studio and teaching students:

The final answer is:
Expected earnings of the dance studio in a month = $100 (rent) + $720 (students) = $820.</s>","The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.
So the total earnings per session is $15 + $25 = $<<15+25=40>>40.
Thus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.
Therefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.

1. Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each. We'll call the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes ""x"". So, Peter has a total of 4x chocolate bars.
2. Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each. We'll call the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes ""y"". So, Martha has a total of 7y chocolate bars.
3. The problem states that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars.

Now, we'll set up an equation to find the value of x and y. Let's call the number of chocolate bars more in each of Peter's boxes than in each of Martha's boxes ""z"".

4. Peter has 64 chocolate bars, so 4x = 64. Solving for x, we get x = 16.
5. Martha has 56 chocolate bars, so 7y = 56. Solving for y, we get y = 8.
6. Now, we're asked to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. But, we've already determined that Peter's boxes contain 16 chocolate bars each and Martha's contain 8 chocolate bars each.

To find the difference, we simply subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from each of Peter's boxes: z = 16 - 8 = 8.

Step 2: We are told that 3/5 of the total population is the number of female porcupines. To find the number of female porcupines, we can use the formula:

Number of Female Porcupines = (Total Population) * (3/5)

Calculating this value:
Number of Female Porcupines = 50 * (3/5)
Number of Female Porcupines = 30

Step 3: Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. To find out how many babies are born in total every month, we multiply the number of female porcupines by the number of babies born per female porcupine.

Total Babies Born Every Month = Number of Female Porcupines * Babies Born Per Female

Calculating this value:

First, let's find the volume of the pool in cubic feet. We can use the formula:

Volume (cubic feet) = Length (feet) * Width (feet) * Depth (feet)

Volume (cubic feet) = 25 * 14 * 4
Volume (cubic feet) = 1,680 cubic feet

Next, we need to find the volume of the pool in gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is equivalent to 7.48 gallons:

Volume (gallons) = Volume (cubic feet) * Conversion factor

Volume (gallons) = 1,680 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot
Volume (gallons) = 12,660.8 gallons

The pool company instructed the Smith family to multiply the volume by 5.9 to account for any losses during the filling process. So, we multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total amount of water needed:

Total water needed (gallons) = Volume (gallons) * 5.9
Total water needed (gallons) = 12,660.8 gallons * 5.9
Total water needed (gallons) = 73,354.34 gallons

The cost to fill the pool with water is $0.10 per gallon, so we find the total cost by multiplying the total water needed by the cost per gallon:

Total cost = Total water needed (gallons) * Cost per gallon
Total cost = 73,354.34 gallons * $0.10/gallon
Total cost = $7,335.43

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that there are 9 red sticks and 5 more blue sticks than red. Let's represent the number of blue sticks as B. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, we can write this relationship as: B = 9 + 5 = 14.

Step 2: We also know that there are 3 fewer yellow sticks than blue sticks. Let's represent the number of yellow sticks as Y. Therefore, we can write this relationship as: Y = B - 3.

Step 3: Now, we need to find the total number of sticks in the game. We have the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks represented in terms of each other. We can find the total number of sticks by substituting the value of the blue sticks from Step 1 into the equation for the yellow sticks in Step 2.

Y = B - 3
Y = 14 - 3
Y = 11

Since we know there are 9 red sticks, we don't need to find the number of red sticks directly as it's already given. However, for completeness, we can find it using the information provided:

Red sticks = 9
Blue sticks = 14
Yellow sticks = 11

Together, the total number of sticks in the game is:

Total sticks = Red sticks + Blue sticks + Yellow sticks
Total sticks = 9 + 14+ 11
Total sticks = 34

{The final answer is 34 sticks}</s>","There are 9 + 5 = <<9+5=14>>14 blue sticks.
There are 14 - 3 = <<14-3=11>>11 yellow sticks.
There are a total of 9 + 14 + 11 = <<9+14+11=34>>34 sticks.

1. Half of the 3000 students are over 16 years old. So, we have:
   3000 * 0.5 = 1500 students over 16 years old

2. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. So, we have:
   1500 * 0.25 = 375 male students over 16 years old

3. The remaining half of the students (3000) are under 16 years old. So, we have:
   3000 * 0.5 = 1500 students under 16 years old

4. One-half of the students under 16 are male. So, we have:
   1500 * 0.5 = 750 male students under 16 years old

5. In total, we have:
   male students = 375 + 750 = 1125 male students

6. Since there are 3000 students in total, and we found that there are 1125 male students, the number of female students would be:
   female students = total students - male students = 3000 - 1125 = 1875

                 [/INST] To determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to find out the number of laps each person can run in an hour and then compare their lap totals. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in 1 hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany: Trey  =  Bethany + 4
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey: Shaelyn = Trey / 2
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn: Quinn = Shaelyn - 2

Now we have the number of laps for each person, let's find the difference between Bethany's and Quinn's laps:

Bethany: 10 laps
Quinn: Quinn = Shaelyn - 2

To find Shaelyn's laps, we need to use the relationships we've established:
Trey = Bethany + 4
Shaelyn = Trey / 2

Substitute Trey's equation into the Shaelyn equation:

Shaelyn = (Bethany + 4) / 2

Multiply both sides by 2:

2 * Shaelyn = Bethany + 4

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2 * Shaelyn = Bethany

Now divide both sides by 2:

Shaelyn = Bethany / 2

Now that we have Shaelyn's laps, we can find Quinn's laps:

Quinn = Shaelyn - 2

Substitute Shaelyn in terms of Bethany:

Quinn = (Bethany / 2) - 2

Simplify the expression:

Quinn = Bethany / 2 - 2
Quinn = (Bethany - 4) / 2

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of laps Bethany and Quinn can run:

Difference = Bethany - Quinn
Difference = Bethany - (Bethany - 4) / 2

Multiply both sides by 2:

2 * Difference = 2 * Bethany - 2 * (Bethany - 4)

Subtract Bethany * 2 from both sides:

2 * Difference = 2 * 4 - 2 * (Bethany - 4)

Simplify:

2 * Difference = 8 - 2B + 2(4-B)

Combine like terms:

2 * Difference = 8 - 2B + 8-2B

Simplify further:

2 * Difference = 16 - 4B

Divide by 2:

Difference = 8 - 2B

Now we have the difference in their laps, the final answer is:

{The final answer is: Bethany can run 8 - 2*Quinn's laps more than Quinn.}</s>","Trey can run 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 laps in one hour.
Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = <<14/2=7>>7 laps in one hour.

                 [/INST] To find the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank for it to be full, we first need to determine how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on each day.

On the first day:
- Wanda pumped 1/4 of the tank's capacity: 18000 gallons * 1/4 = 4500 gallons
- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda: 3/4 * 4500 gallons = 6750 gallons
- Total amount of water pumped on the first day: 4500 gallons + 6750 gallons = 11,250 gallons

On the second day:
- Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day: 2/3 * 4500 gallons = 6000 gallons
- Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day: 1/3 * 6750 gallons = 2250 gallons
- Total amount of water pumped on the second day: 6000 gallons + 2250 gallons = 8250 gallons

Now we need to find out how much water is already in the tank after the first day and add the water pumped on the second day.

Water in the tank after the first day: 18000 gallons (capacity) - 11,250 gallons (water pumped on the first day) = 6750 gallons

Water pumped on the second day: 8250 gallons

Total water in the tank: 6750 gallons (after day 1) + 8250 gallons (day 2) = 15,000 gallons

Finally, to find out how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full, we subtract the current amount of water from the tank's capacity:

Remaining water: 18000 gallons (capacity) - 15000 gallons (current water) = 3000 gallons

{The final answer is: 3000 gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full.}</s>","On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.
On the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.
They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons
Ms. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons
Together, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons
In the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = <<4125+7875=12000>>12000 gallons
The amount of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = <<18000-12000=6000>>6000 gallons

In ? the end, the charge remaining was ? 28%. What : was the , charge ; of ! the power bank when Maria went out to the park?
                 [/INST] To solve this problem, we'll need to make some assumptions and calculate the charge loss at each stage.

Assumptions:
1. Maria disconnected the power bank right before noticing it wasn't fully charged.
2. Her friends charged their phones for 5 hours before her battery started losing charge at a different rate.
3. The power bank lost 9% of the total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours.
4. The power bank lost 7% of the total capacity each hour for the next 3 hours.

Calculations:
a) First, let's find out how much capacity the power bank lost during the first 5 hours when it was losing 9% of the capacity per hour. We know that capacity loss per hour is 9%.

Capacity loss in 5 hours = Capacity * 9% * 5

b) Next, we'll find out how much capacity was left in the power bank after 5 hours. Since the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour, and the initial capacity was 100%, the capacity left after 5 hours is:

Capacity left after 5 hours = 100% - 9% * 5 = 81%

c) After 5 hours, the power bank started losing 7% of the capacity per hour. For 3 hours, the power bank lost:

Capacity loss in 3 hours = Capacity * 7% * 3

d) So, the total capacity remaining in the power bank after charging her friends' phones and losing capacities at two different rates is:

Total capacity remaining = Capacity left after 5 hours - Capacity loss in 3 hours

Total capacity remaining = 81% - Capacity * 7% * 3

e) We are given that the remaining capacity is 28%. Using this information, we can set up an equation and solve for the initial capacity:

Capacity = (Total capacity remaining / Initial charging efficiency)

Capacity = (28 / (81 - 7*3))

Solving this equation, we get:

Capacity = 72

Since the initial capacity was 100%, and we calculated that the power bank had 72% of the capacity remaining after the events described, we can conclude that:

{The final answer is: The power bank had 72% or 0.72 * 100 = 72 watts-hour of charge when Maria went out to the park.}</s>","At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.
Later on, the power bank lost 7% per hour * 3 hours = 21%.
The power bank charge remaining was 28%, so the power bank charge before going to the park was 45 + 21 +28 = 94%.

                    question:
                    Janet gets a , job ; as a waitress.  , She makes $10 an hour from ? wages and another $15 an hour from tips. .  She . wants . to save up 20% of the , cost of . a . $10000 ? car ? for a ! downpayment.  If she works ! 40 . hours ? a week how many weeks will she need to work ! to ; save the down payment?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate Janet's weekly earnings from wages and tips.
Janet earns $10 an hour from wages and works 40 hours a week. So her weekly wage earnings are: 10 dollars per hour * 40 hours per week = $400 per week.

She earns another $15 an hour from tips and the number of hours she works for tips is not mentioned in the problem, so we cannot calculate her weekly tips yet.

Step 2: Calculate how much she needs to save each week for the down payment.
To save a down payment of $10000, Janet needs to save $2000 as a 20% downpayment of the car's cost.

Step 3: Calculate how long it will take her to save the down payment from her wage earnings alone.
Let 'n' be the number of weeks it takes for Janet to save up for the downpayment using only her wage earnings. Then:
$400 per week * n weeks = $10000
By solving for 'n', we get: n = $10000 / $400/week = 2500/4 = 625 weeks

However, this calculation does not take into account the tips she earns each week. To find the actual number of weeks it will take her to save the downpayment, we need to calculate the total weekly earnings and the percentage of that amount she is saving towards the downpayment.

Step 4: Calculate the total weekly earnings.
Since the problem does not provide information on the number of hours Janet works for tips, let's assume she works the same number of hours for tips as for wages. So, her total weekly earnings are $400 (wages) + tips.

Step 5: Calculate the savings percentage.
Janet wants to save 20% of her total weekly earnings for the downpayment.

Step 6: Calculate the number of weeks needed to save the downpayment with both wage and tip income.
Let's assume her weekly tips are 't'. Then:
$400 + t * hours_for_tips = $400 * (1 + savings_percentage)
Where savings_percentage = 0.2, hours_for_tips = 40 (assuming she works the same number of hours for tips as for wages) and t is the weekly tips she earns. Solving for 't' we get:
t = ($400 * (1 + 0.2) - $400) / hours_for_tips
t = $400 * 1.2 - $400 / 40
t = $960 / 40
t = $24.5
It's not realistic for Janet to earn $24.5 in tips every week, so we need to adjust our assumption of the number of hours she works for tips. Assuming she works 60 hours a week (30 hours for wage and 30 hours for tips), her weekly earnings would be:
$10/hour * 30 hours (wages) + $15/hour * 30 hours (tips) = $3900
And her weekly savings would be: 20% of $3900 = $780
Then the number of weeks she needs to save the downpayment is: $10000 / $780/week = 12.8 weeks
Since she cannot save for a fraction of a week, she will need to work for at least 13 weeks to save the downpayment.

So, the final answer is: {Janet will need to work 13 weeks to save up the downpayment for a $10000 car}.</s>","She makes 10+15=$<<10+15=25>>25 an hour from working
That means each week she makes 25*40=$<<25*40=1000>>1000
She wants to make 10000*.2=$<<10000*.2=2000>>2000
So she needs to work 2000/1000=<<2000/1000=2>>2 weeks

Second, let's calculate how much he has spent so far on the items he's mentioned: 3 peaches at $0.5 each, 4 pears at $0.5 each, 2 kiwis at $1 each, and 5 apples at $0.75 each.

Peaches: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
Pears: 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
Kiwis: 2 * $1 = $2.0
Apples: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Third, let's calculate the total amount Jamaar has spent so far: $1.5 (peaches) + $2.0 (pears) + $2.0 (kiwis) + $3.75 (apples) = $7.25.

Fourth, let's find out how much more money Jamaar has left to spend. We know he started with $10 + m, and he's spent $7.25, so: $10 + m - $7.25 = x (let's call the remaining money x).

Fifth, let's find out how many plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining money x. Plums cost $0.25 each, so: x / $0.25 = number of plums.

So, Jamaar can buy {number of plums = x / $0.25} plums with the remaining money. We can't calculate the exact number of plums right now, as the variable m (Jamaar's earnings) isn't specified in the problem. However, the above calculation shows the steps to find out the final answer once the value of m is known.</s>","He has spent $3.5 on peaches and pears because 7 x .5 = <<7*.5=3.5>>3.5

                 [/INST] To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the percentage increase successively for each year.

Step 1: Find the price after one year, with a 5% increase.
Price after one year = Initial price * (1 + Percentage increase)
Price after one year = $120 * (1 + 0.05)
Price after one year = $120 * 1.05
Price after one year = $126

Step 2: Find the price after two years, with another 5% increase.
Price after two years = Price after one year * (1 + Percentage increase)
Price after two years = $126 * 1.05
Price after two years = $132.30 (rounded up to the nearest cent)

Step 3: Find the price after three years, with another 5% increase.
Price after three years = Price after two years * (1 + Percentage increase)
Price after three years = $132.30 * 1.05
Price after three years = $140.21 (rounded up to the nearest cent)

Step 4: Round the final answer to the nearest integer since the question asked for an integer answer.

{The final answer is:}
$140 (rounded down since $141 is the nearest integer to $140.21)</s>","In the first year, the price of carrots increases by 5/100*120 = $<<5/100*120=6>>6
After 3 years, the price of carrots will increase by $6*3 = $<<6*3=18>>18
The total price of carrots after three years will be 120+18 = $<<120+18=138>>138

Selfies = 3 * Number of pictures per album

Step 4: The remaining 5 albums were for portraits. So, the number of portraits is 5 albums * number of pictures per album.

Portraits = 5 * Number of pictures per album

1. James takes 10 minutes to read 3 pages.
2. To find his reading rate per page, we'll divide the number of pages he reads in 10 minutes by the number of minutes it takes him to read them:
   Reading rate per page = Number of pages / Time (minutes)
   = 3 pages / 10 minutes
   = 0.3 pages per minute
3. To find how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we'll divide the total number of pages he reads by his reading rate:
   Time (minutes) = Number of pages / Reading rate per page
   = 18 pages / 0.3 pages per minute
   = 60 minutes
4. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can also express the time as:
   Time (minutes) = 60 minutes

{The final answer is: It takes James 60 minutes (1 hour) to read 18 pages of his book.}</s>","James would take 18 ÷ 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 times longer if he read all 18 pages.

100 (total guests) - 24 (early checkout) - 15 (late checkout) = 61 guests

Step 2: In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for late checkout. So the number of people who checked in in the afternoon is:

15 (late checkout) * 2 = 30 guests

Step 3: Then, 7 more people checked in after dinner was served. So the total number of guests in the hotel now is:

61 (guests who didn't check out by evening) + 30 (people who checked in in the afternoon) + 7 (people who checked in after dinner) = 98 guests

1. First, let's find the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:
   - Easy questions make up 40% of the 60-item quiz.
   - The number of easy questions is: 0.4 * 60 = 24

2. The remaining questions are split equally between average and difficult questions. Since there are two types of questions, each makes up 50% of the remaining 60% of the quiz.
   - Number of average questions: 50% of 0.4 * 60 = 12
   - Number of difficult questions: 50% of 0.4 * 60 = 12

3. Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions right: 24 * 0.75 = 18.

4. Aries is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct:
   - For average questions: 12 * 0.5 = 6
   - For difficult questions: 12 * 0.5 = 6

5. Aries total number of correct answers is the sum of the correct answers from easy, average, and difficult questions: 18 + 6 + 6 = 30

{The final answer is: Aries is sure to get 30 points.}</s>","The average and difficult questions comprises 100% - 40% = 60% of the quiz.

Today, she sold twice as : many , small stuffed animals ! as large ones and earned $120 from ; the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $4. . How many small ? stuffed ; animals did she sell?
                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. First, we need to determine the relationship between the price of large stuffed animals and small stuffed animals. We know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Let's represent the price of a small stuffed animal as x. Then, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.
2. Next, we are told that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned a total of $120 from the sales. Let x be the number of small stuffed animals sold, and y be the number of large stuffed animals sold. We can set up two equations based on the given information:

x + y = 2y (the total number of small and large animals sold is twice the number of large animals sold)
4x + 3x = $120 (the total earnings from the sales)

3. To simplify the second equation, we can combine like terms: 7x = $120. Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = $120/7 ≈ 171.37. Since Teresa can't sell a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round this number down to 171 small stuffed animals.
4. Now, we can use the first equation to find the number of large stuffed animals sold: y = 2(171) - x = 2(171) - 171 = 341 - 171 = 170.

5. Although this calculation gives us an answer for the number of large stuffed animals, we reached it by rounding the number of small stuffed animals. However, since the problem gives us the exact number of small stuffed animals sold, the answer for the number of large stuffed animals must be incorrect. Unfortunately, with the given information, it seems impossible for Teresa to have sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones while earning $120. {The final answer is: there isn't a valid solution based on the given information.}</s>","Let A be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.
Thus, she sold 2A small stuffed animals.
Large stuffed animals cost 3 * 4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.
She earned 12A + 4 * 2A = 12A + 8A = 20A = $120 from selling stuffed animals today.
Thus, she sold A = 120 / 20 = <<120/20=6>>6 large stuffed animals today.
Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, so she sold 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 small stuffed animals today.

                    Tom buys ! a bedroom set for $3000.  . He sells ? his old . bedroom ! for $1000 and : uses that to pay : for part ; of : the bedroom ! set. :  ; He then : has to pay 10% a month for the . bedroom set.  How much does he have to pay per month?
                 [/INST] To find out how much Tom has to pay per month for the bedroom set after he has already paid part of it with the money from selling his old bedroom set, we need to first determine how much he paid for the new bedroom set and how much he paid with the sale money.

1. Tom bought a new bedroom set for $3000.
2. He sold his old bedroom set for $1000 and used that money to pay part of the new bedroom set's cost.

To find out how much he paid with his own money for the new bedroom set, we can subtract the amount he received from selling the old one from the total cost.

Final answer:

1. The cost of the new bedroom set: $3000
2. The amount Tom received from selling the old bedroom set: $1000
3. The difference between the cost of the new bedroom set and the amount Tom paid in cash: $3000 (cost of the new bedroom set) - $1000 (amount paid from the sale) = $2900

So Tom paid $2900 out of his own pocket for the new bedroom set. To find out how much he has to pay per month for the remaining balance, we need to divide this amount by the number of months he agreed to pay in installments, and then calculate the monthly payment including the 10% monthly interest.

4. The amount Tom paid in cash for the new bedroom set: $2900
5. Tom has to pay 10% monthly interest on the remaining balance.

First, let's find the number of months Tom agrees to pay for the bedroom set by calculating the total amount he'll pay including the interest.

When paying a fixed-payments loan, the monthly payments consist of the principal (the outstanding balance) and the interest. In our case, the remaining balance is $2900, and we know Tom will pay 10% per month in interest.

Let's denote the number of months we are trying to find as `n`. Then we have:

Monthly payment = Principal + Interest
$ (Payment per month) = $ (Principal) + 0.1 * $ (Principal)

Here, we do not know the monthly payment, so we set the equation equal to the principal, and we get this expression:

$ (Payment per month) = 1.1 * $ (Principal)

To find the number of months, we must first find the monthly payment (the installment) paying off the remaining balance ($2900) with a 10% monthly interest rate. We can use the above expression to calculate the monthly payment, which equals the principal multiplied by 1.1 if all monthly payments are equal.

Monthly payment = Payment per month
$ (Principal) = $ (Payment per month) / 1.1

Now we want to calculate the principal ($2900) for a known monthly payment. We already have the equation, so we just need to swap the variables:

$ (Payment per month) = $ (Principal) / 1.1

The equation is unchanged, but now we want the principal (the unknown value) and we have the monthly payment ($?).

We want to find the number of months, but we don't currently have enough information to directly solve for it. Since we want to know the number of months to pay in full, we can set up the equation to find when the remaining principal is $0:

$ (Principal_t) = $ (Payment per month) * number_of_months

As Tom pays off the remaining balance, the principal will decrease over time, and eventually, it will reach $0 when all the payments are made. The initial remaining balance is $2900.

$0 = $ (Payment per month) * number_of_months

We can solve for the number of months given the equation above, which would allow us to find how many installments Tom should make to pay off the remaining balance, but without the exact monthly payment, we would have to make a guess and check approach, which may not be feasible or efficient. To get the exact monthly payment and the number of installments, the provided information would need to be more complete.

In summary, based on the available information, Tom paid $2900 for the new bedroom set and has to pay 10% monthly interest on the remaining balance. However, we cannot calculate the exact monthly payment or the number of installments","He has to pay 3000-1000=$<<3000-1000=2000>>2000
So he has to pay 2000*.1=$<<2000*.1=200>>200 per month

First, let's find out how many red balloons burst: 25 red balloons * 40% = 10 red balloons
So now Sally is left with 15 red balloons

Next, let's find out how many yellow balloons were released: 12 yellow balloons / 2 = 6 yellow balloons
So now Sally is left with 6 yellow balloons

Now she picked 8 blue balloons: So, Sally had 15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 8 blue balloons = 29 balloons

Her remaining clutch of balloons had 29 balloons. Therefore,
{The final answer is 29 balloons}</s>","Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons

                 [/INST] Let's find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow. We can calculate this by finding the probability that neither a substitute teacher nor an extension is given and Marcus doesn't convince his teacher to give him a personal extension.

1. Probability of a substitute teacher not showing up: 50% = 0.5
2. Probability of a normal teacher coming in and not giving an extension to the class: 60% = 0.6
3. Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher to give him a personal extension if both a normal teacher is present and an extension isn't given: 20% = 0.2

To find the probability of all these events happening together (i.e., Marcus has to turn in his homework) we need to multiply their individual probabilities:

Probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework = P(Substitute teacher doesn't show up) * P(Normal teacher gives no extension) * P(Marcus doesn't convince the teacher for a personal extension)
= 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2
= 0.12 or 12%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 12%. {The final answer is 12%}</s>","First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%
Then find the chance the teacher doesn't grant the whole class an extension by subtracting the chance she does from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%
Then find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%
Now find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3
Now multiply that probability by the probability Marcus can't get a personal extension to find the probability he actually has to turn in his homework: .3 * .8 = <<.3*.8=.24>>.24

                 [/INST] To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to first find out how many seats are available for guests.

1. The Fine Arts Center has a capacity of 6000 people.
2. There are 950 seats for graduates.
3. There are 300 seats for faculty.

First, let's find out how many seats are left for guests:

The total number of seats in the Fine Arts Center is: 6000
The number of seats for graduates is: 950
The number of seats for faculty is: 300

To find the number of seats for guests, we need to subtract the seats for graduates and faculty from the total capacity:

Total capacity - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty = Seats for guests
6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats

Now, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive if the tickets are split equally among the graduates and their guests.

Since we don't have the number of guests per graduate, we'll assume each graduate brings an equal number of guests, let's call it x.

The total number of seats for graduates and guests is: 4750 seats + (Number of graduates * x seats per graduate)

We know there are 950 graduates, so we can set up the equation:

950 + 950x = 4750

To solve for x, we can first subtract 950 from both sides:

950x = 3800
x = 3800/950
x ≈ 3.985

Since it's not possible for each graduate to bring more than one guest, this problem has an inconsistency.

The final answer is: This problem has an inconsistency, and it's not possible to provide a valid answer according to the given information.</s>","Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates
Minus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 6000 - 1250 = <<6000-1250=4750>>4750 remaining seats.

1. It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.
2. Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.

From the first piece of information, we know that L = 75.

From the second piece of information, we know that:

M = 2 * L / 3 => M = 2 * 75 / 3 => M = 50

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, now we have the number of medium-sized beans he can eat which is 50.

Now let's find the number of small beans Grandpa can eat. From the third piece of information, we know that:

S = Large number of jelly beans eaten / Number of medium-sized jelly beans eaten

We already have the number of large jelly beans Grandpa can eat (L = 75) and the number of medium-sized jelly beans he can eat (M = 50). Therefore,

S = L / M => S = 75 / 50

S = 1.5

Since Grandpa can't eat half of a small jelly bean, this means that he can eat 1 small jelly bean for every medium-sized jelly bean he eats. We know there are 50 medium-sized jelly beans, so the number of small jelly beans he can eat is:

Small jelly beans = Medium-sized jelly beans
= 50

{The final answer is 50 small jelly beans.}</s>","If Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, then eating 75 large beans is the same as eating 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 medium-sized jelly beans.

Total cost of Parmesan = (Price per pound) * (Number of pounds) = $11/pound * 2 pounds = $22
Total cost of Mozzarella = $6/pound * 3 pounds = $18

Total cost of cheeses = $22 + $18 = $40

Now, we know her starting cash was $50, so the difference between her starting cash and the cost of the cheeses will give us the amount of money she has left to buy meat.

Amount of money left to buy meat = Starting cash - Cost of cheeses
x = $50 - $40

                    question:
                    Jim ; decides to ? go to ! college to earn : some more money.  It takes him 4 years . to finish and ; he gets ! $50,000 in loans per year.  If he had a 25k a . year ? job before college ! and his college ! degree : tripled his income, how long , would ! it take , to earn the money ? equivalent to the loans and ; the money ; lost from not ; working while ; in school.
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jim attended college for 4 years and took out loans amounting to $50,000 per year. In total, he now has $50,000 × 4 = $<<50000*4=200000>>200,000 in student loans.
2. Before attending college, Jim had a job that paid him $25,000 annually. After graduating from college, his income tripled, meaning he now earns $25,000 × 3 = $<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year.
3. To find out how long it takes Jim to earn enough money to pay off his student loans and replace the income he lost during his college years, we need to compare his current annual debt service and his new income.

First, let's find out how much income Jim lost during his college years. He attended college for 4 years and didn't earn his pre-college salary, so he lost a total of $25,000 × 4 = $<<25000*4=100000>>100,000.

Now, Jim needs to earn enough money to pay off his student loans and recover the lost income. So, we have to calculate how long it takes to earn the combined total of $200,000 in loans plus $100,000 in lost income.

To determine the time needed to earn that amount, we can divide the total amount by Jim's new salary: $<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000 ÷ $75,000 = <<300000/75000=4>>approximately 4.27 years. Since Jim can't work for a fraction of a year, he'd need to work 5 full years to earn enough money.

{The final answer is: It would take Jim 5 years to earn enough money to pay off his student loans and recover the income he lost during college.}</s>","His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year
So he earns an extra 75,000-25,000=$<<75000-25000=50000>>50,000 a year
His loan cost 50,000*4=$<<50000*4=200000>>200,000
He lost out on 25,000*4=$<<25000*4=100000>>100,000 from not working
So he needs to make 200,000+100,000=$<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000
That means it will take 300,000/50,000=<<300000/50000=6>>6 years

                 [/INST] To find out how many square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy for his comforter on a king-sized bed, we'll calculate the area of two additional pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

1. First, let's find the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. Since he requires fabric that's 2 feet wider and longer than the bed, we add 2 feet to each dimension.

Bed size: 6 ft (length) x 8 ft (width)
Added dimensions: 2 ft (x2) for each side

Fabric dimensions: 6 ft + 2 ft (length) x 8 ft + 2 ft (width)
The final answer is: Jim needs fabric that is 8 ft x 10 ft (8 ft long x 10 ft wide).

Next, we'll calculate the area of one piece of fabric:

Area of fabric = Length x Width
               = 8 ft x 10 ft
               = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:

Total area needed = 2 x (Area of one piece of fabric)
                 = 2 x 80 square feet
                 = 160 square feet

The final answer is: Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric for his comforter.</s>","First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet
Then find the width of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's width: 8 feet + 2 feet = <<8+2=10>>10 feet
Then find the square footage of each piece of fabric by multiplying its length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet
Then double that amount since Jim needs two pieces of fabric: 80 square feet/piece * 2 pieces = <<80*2=160>>160 square feet

Step 2: On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.So, the number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 2 * (890) + 5 = 1791.

Step 3: To find the total number of letters delivered Monday - Wednesday, we add the number of letters delivered each day.So, the total number of letters delivered Monday - Wednesday is 425 + 890 + 1791 = 3096.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the amount Johnny's dad lost on the first race as X. We know that he lost $5 on the first race, so X = $5.

Step 2: On the second race, Johnny's dad won an amount that was $1 more than twice the amount he lost on the first race. So, the amount he won on the second race was 2X + $1.

Step 3: On the third race, he lost 1.5 times the amount he won on the second race. So, the amount he lost on the third race was 1.5(2X + $1).

Step 4: The total amount Johnny's dad lost that day was X + (2X + $1) + 1.5(2X + $1).

Step 5: Simplifying the equation, we have:

X + 2X + $1 + 1.5(2X + $1) = X + 3X + $1 + 3X + $1.5X
5X + $2.5 = 7X + $2
1X = $4.5
X = $4.5

So, Johnny's dad lost $4.5 on the first race.

Step 6: The total amount he lost that day was:

$4.5 + ($2X + $1) + 1.5(2X + $1) = $4.5 + 2X + $1 + 3X + $1.5X

Step 7: Simplifying further:

$4.5 + 2X + $1 + 3X + $1.5X = $4.5 + 5X + $2.5

Step 8: The average amount Johnny's dad lost per race was:

($Total\ amount\ lost)\ /\ ($Number\ of\ races) = ($4.5 + 5X + $2.5)\ /\ 3

Step 9: Substituting the value of X from step 5, we get:

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many hours are in 3 weeks for the team of 4 painters. We know that there are 7 days in a week, so:
   Days in 3 weeks = 3 weeks × 7 days/week
   = 21 days

2. Next, we need to find out how many hours the team of 4 painters worked each day. We're given that they worked for 3/8ths of a day:
   Hours worked per day by the team = 3/8ths of a day × 24 hours/day
   = 12 hours/day (since 1 day × 24 hours = 24 × 1/8 = 3 × 1/2 = 3/2 hours or 12 hours)

3. Now, we can find out how many hours each painter worked per day by dividing the total hours worked per day by the number of painters:
   Hours worked per painter per day = Total hours worked per day / Number of painters
   = 12 hours/day / 4 painters
   = 3 hours/painter/day

4. To find out the total number of hours each painter worked in 3 weeks, we multiply the number of hours they worked per day by the number of days in 3 weeks:
   Total hours worked by each painter = Hours worked per painter per day × Days in 3 weeks
   = 3 hours/painter/day × 21 days
   = 63 hours

Therefore, the final answer is: Each painter worked for 63 hours in 3 weeks.</s>","There are 24 hours in a day so 3/8ths of a day is (3/8)*24 = <<3/8*24=9>>9 hours

1. We know that Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls.
2. In the first set, he retrieved more balls than in the second set. Let's call the number of balls in the second set x.
3. In the first set, he retrieved x + 4 balls. (He had to retrieve 4 more balls than in the second set)
4. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, which is x/2 balls.
5. Since the total number of balls is 19, we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19
6. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x + 2(x + 4) = 38
7. Distribute the 2 on the left side: 2x + 2x + 8 = 38
8. Combine like terms: 4x + 8 = 38
9. Subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 30
10. Divide both sides by 4: x = 7.5
11. Since it's not possible to have half a set of tennis balls, there must be a mistake in the problem or we're missing some important information. As it stands, the problem doesn't have a valid solution. {The final answer is: The problem contradicts itself, and there is no valid solution.}</s>","Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.
In the second set, he retrieved 2B balls.
In the first set, he retrieved 2B + 4 balls.
In total, he retrieved B + 2B + 2B + 4 = 5B + 4 = 19 balls.
Thus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.
Therefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.
Hence, in the second set, he retrieved 2B = 3 * 2 = 6 balls.
In the first set he retrieved 2(3) + 4 balls = 10

To find the value of the car in 2009, we need to apply the depreciation rate for one year.

Depreciation rate = 21% per year

Value of the car in 2009 = Value of the car in 2007 * (1 - Depreciation rate)
Value of the car in 2009 = $20000 * (1 - 0.21)

Calculation:
Value of the car in 2009 = $20000 * (1 - 0.21)
Value of the car in 2009 = $20000 * 0.79
Value of the car in 2009 = $15800

Step 2: Find the value of the car in 2010.
To find the value of the car in 2010, we need to apply the depreciation rate for one more year.

Depreciation rate = 21% per year

Value of the car in 2010 = Value of the car in 2009 * (1 - Depreciation rate)
Value of the car in 2010 = $15800 * (1 - 0.21)

Calculation:

2. 10% of the 50 books are written in German:
   Number of German books = (1/10) * 50 = 5
3. Now we know there are 25 English books, 5 German books, so there must be:

Total kitchen floor area = 200 sq ft
Side length of each tile = 1 ft
Area of one tile = (Side length)² = 1 ft × 1 ft = 1 sq ft

To find the number of tiles, divide the total kitchen floor area (in sq ft) by the area of one tile (in sq ft):
Number of tiles = Total kitchen floor area / Area of one tile = 200 sq ft / 1 sq ft = 200 tiles

2. Calculate the total cost of purchasing the tiles:

Cost after accident = Normal cost * 1.6
Cost after accident = $120 * 1.6
Cost after accident = $192 per month

Step 2: Calculate the cost James pays per year. We find the annual cost by multiplying the monthly cost by the number of months in a year.

1. Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.
2. So, in one week, he needs to wash sheets for 5 beds (4 twin and 1 king).
3. He can wash 2 twin sets of sheets and 1 king set of sheets at a time in his laundry machine.
4. Therefore, in one week, he needs to do (5 beds) ÷ (sets of sheets washed in one load) = ∣∣∣(5/3)∣∣∣ loads of laundry.
5. Since Greg can't divide the number of loads by a decimal, he needs to find a way to wash enough sets of sheets to cover his weekly needs without any leftovers or shortages.
6. As there are 52 weeks in a year, the number of loads of laundry Greg needs to do in a year can be calculated as (weekly loads) x (weeks per year).

                 [/INST] Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We know that the meal was made in 98 minutes. Let's call the length of Donovan's part of the meal ""x"" minutes.
2. We're told that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so the length of Betsy's part is x + 18 minutes.
3. We're given two equations based on the information above:
   a) x + (x + 18) = 98
4. To solve this system of equations, we first need to get rid of the ""x + x"" term. We can do this by combining like terms: 2x + 18 = 98
5. Now, we can subtract 18 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable: 2x = 80
6. Finally, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of x: x = 40 minutes
7. Since we know that x represents the length of Donovan's part of the meal, and we also found that x = 40 minutes, we can find the length of Betsy's part by plugging x back into the equation for Betsy's part: Betsy's part = (x + 18) minutes = (40 + 18) minutes = 58 minutes

{The final answer is 58 minutes for Betsy's part of the meal.}</s>","Let D = Donovan's time in minutes
Betsy = D + <<+18=18>>18
2D + 18 = 98
2D = 80
D = <<40=40>>40

                 [/INST] To find the total cost of the doctor's visit for Hannah, we need to calculate the cost of the cast, the cost of the 30-minute visit, and the cost of the parking.

Cost of the cast: $200
Cost of the 30-minute visit: $300/hour * 0.5 hours (30 minutes is half an hour)
Cost of the painkillers: $4/pill * 30 pills
Cost of the parking: $6/hour * 2 hours

Now, we'll add up all these costs to find the total cost of the doctor's visit:

Total cost = Cost of the cast + Cost of the 30-minute visit + Cost of the painkillers + Cost of the parking
Total cost = $200 + $150 + $120 + $120
Total cost = $610

Then find the total cost of the painkillers: $4/pill * 30 pills = $<<4*30=120>>120
Then find the cost of the parking: $6/hour * 2 hours = $<<6*2=12>>12
Then add all the different costs to find the total cost: $12 + $120 + $150 + $200 = $<<12+120+150+200=482>>482

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of emails that don't require a response.
- 20% of James' daily emails don't require a response.
- James receives 80 emails per day.

Email_no_response = (Percentage_of_unresponded_emails) * (Total_emails_per_day)
Email_no_response = (0.2) * (80)
Email_no_response = 16

So, 16 emails don't require a response per day.

Step 2: Calculate the number of emails James responds to daily.
- James responds to all emails that don't require a response + the emails that do require a response.
- Number_of_emails_responded_daily = Total_emails_per_day - Email_no_response

Number_of_emails_responded_daily = 80 - 16
Number_of_emails_responded_daily = 64

Step 3: Calculate the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week.
- Total_emails_responded_per_week = Number_of_emails_responded_daily * Number_of_days_per_week

Total_emails_responded_per_week = 64 * 5

The problem states that ""two hours after the trucks had departed for delivery, Mr Hezekiah got the news that a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures."" Let's assume that Mr. Hezekiah dispatched n trucks. So, a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, which means that (n/4) trucks faced this issue.

Step 2: Calculate the number of tons of fertiliser carried by a truck that reached the farmers.
Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.

Step 3: Determine the number of trucks that reached the farmers.
The number of trucks that reached the farmers is the total number of trucks dispatched minus the number of trucks that had mechanical failures: n - (n/4) = 3n/4

Step 4: Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers.
Total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = Number of trucks that reached the farmers * Total tons of fertiliser carried by each truck
Total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = (3n/4) * 20 tons = (3/2) * n * 20 tons

                 [/INST] To find out how much money each person has left, we first need to find out how much money they spent and then subtract that amount from their initial $60.

1. Maggie spent a quarter of her money. So, the amount Maggie spent is:
   Maggie's spending = Quarter of her money
              = (1/4) * her money

2. Riza spent one-third of her money. So, the amount Riza spent is:
   Riza's spending = One-third of her money
              = (1/3) * her money

3. Now, let's find out Maggie's and Riza's initial money to find out how much they have left.
   We know they each had $60 initially.
   Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as ""m"" and the amount of money Riza had as ""r"".

4. From the information given, we can write the following equations:
   a) Maggie's spending = (1/4) * m
   b) Riza's spending = (1/3) * r

5. We know that both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially, so we have the following equation:
   c) m + r = 2 * $60

6. Using the equations (a) and (b), we can find the amount of money Maggie and Riza spent:
   From equation (a): Maggie's spending = (1/4) * m => m = 4 * Maggie's spending
   From equation (b): Riza's spending = (1/3) * r => r = 3 * Riza's spending

7. Now substitute the expressions for m and r from step 6 into equation (c):
   4 * Maggie's spending + 3 * Riza's spending = 2 * $60

8. At this point, we don't have enough information to solve for both Maggie's and Riza's spending (i.e., we have three variables and only one equation). So, we need more context to get a definitive answer.

9. Since we can't find a definitive answer without more information, the final answer is: There isn't enough information to determine how much money they both have left.</s>","Maggie spent $60/4 = $<<60/4=15>>15.
So, Maggie is left with $60 - $15 = $<<60-15=45>>45.
Riza spent $60/3 = $<<60/3=20>>20.
So, Riza is left with $60 - $20 = $<<60-20=40>>40.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We know that 315 bananas are enough for three monkeys for a week.
2. One monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so one monkey consumes 10 × 7 = <<10*7=70>>70 bananas per week.
3. The second monkey eats 10 bananas each day, just like the first monkey, but also eats 4 more bananas, making the daily consumption of the second monkey 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas.
4. The third monkey eats the remaining bananas, so the sum of the bananas consumed by the first and second monkeys each day is 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 bananas.
5. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas the first and second monkeys consume in a week is 24 × 7 = <<24*7=171>>171 bananas.
6. The remaining bananas for the third monkey are 315 minus the bananas already eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week, which is 315 - 171 = <<315-171=144>>144 bananas.
7. Since the third monkey eats all the remaining bananas each day, the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day is 144 bananas divided by the number of days in a week (7 days), which is 144 / 7 = <<144/7=20.57142857142857>>20.57 bananas.
8. However, since it's not possible for a monkey to eat a fraction of a banana each day, there must be a mistake in the provided information, as the given data doesn't add up to the total number of bananas (315) mentioned in the question.

{The final answer is, there is an error in the provided data.}</s>","Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.
The second monkey eats 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas a day.
So the first and the second monkey eat a total of 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 bananas each day.
Hence, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = <<45-24=21>>21 bananas each day.

Step 3: So, in total, Teddy finished 1000 pieces of puzzles (500 from the first puzzle and 500 from the second puzzle) within an hour.

Step 4: However, the problem asks for the number of puzzle pieces that Teddy placed during that hour, not the number of finished pieces. Since Teddy was working on each puzzle, he was constantly placing new pieces.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the cost of the flowers Jenny bought.
Jenny bought 15 roses individually, which cost $2 each. So, the cost of the 15 roses is 15 x $2 = $30.

Step 2: Find the cost of the flowers bought in dozen as Jenny also bought some in a dozen.
Jenny bought flowers in a dozen, and the cost of a dozen roses is $15.

Step 3: Find the total amount of money Jenny spent on flowers.
Total amount spent = Cost of individual roses + Cost of roses in a dozen
Total amount spent = $30 + $15 = $45

Step 4: Find the number of quarters Jenny has as change.
Jenny only has $5 dollars in 5 quarter coins, and she already spent $45 on the flowers. So, the difference is how many quarters she is left with:
Quarters = $5 (Five dollars) - $45 (amount Jenny spent on flowers) = -$40

However, the problem states that Jenny has quarters for change, so we need to find out how many quarters she had initially and how many she is left with, which gives us the final number of quarters she is left with. To do that, let's first calculate how many quarters are in her initial $5:

$5 = $0.25 x ""number of quarters""
""number of quarters"" = $5 / $0.25 = 20 quarters

Step 5: Find the number of quarters Jenny has left after spending $45
Quarters left = Initial number of quarters - Change spent = 20 quarters - $45 / $0.25 = 20 quarters - 180 quarters = -155 quarters

Since we can't have a negative number of quarters, this means that Jenny doesn't have enough quarters to cover the change she was supposed to get. There's an inconsistency in the problem's setup.

However, the final step of the calculation assuming the setup of the problem is consistent would have been:

Step 6: Find the number of quarters Jenny leaves with.
Quarters left = Initial number of quarters - Change spent = 20 quarters - $45 / $0.25 = 20 quarters - 180 quarters = -155 quarters

So, the final answer would have been {-155 quarters}, but since the problem setup is inconsistent, this answer isn't applicable.</s>","Jenny has $25 because 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25

1. Milkshakes: Terry sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each. So, the revenue from milkshakes is 6 x $5.50 = $33.

2. Burger platters: Terry sells 9 burger platters at $11 each. So, the revenue from burger platters is 9 x $11 = $99.

3. Sodas: Terry sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each. So, the revenue from sodas is 20 x $1.50 = $30.

Therefore, the total revenue Terry makes is $33 (milkshakes) + $99 (burger platters) + $30 (sodas) = $162.

{The first train leaves the station at (10 minutes) - 10 minutes = 0 minutes before the first train's scheduled arrival.}

Step 2: Calculate the duration of the first train's stay at the station. The first train stays in the station for 20 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate the departure time of the second train. The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves. First, find the departure time of the first train (from step 1). Since the second train is to arrive half an hour afterward, the second train leaves the station:

{The second train leaves the station 30 minutes after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 minutes + (0 minutes) = 30 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival.}

Step 4: Calculate the duration of the second train's stay at the station. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time that the first train stayed. Since the first train stayed for 20 minutes, the second train stays for:

{The second train stays in the station for 20 minutes * (1/4) = 5 minutes.}

Step 5: Calculate the departure time of the third train. The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves, so the third train leaves the station:

{The third train leaves the station after the second train leaves (30 minutes + 30 minutes = 1 hour), so the third train leaves the station 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1 hour and 30 minutes (90 minutes) after the first train's scheduled arrival.}

Step 6: Calculate the duration of the third train's stay at the station. The question doesn't provide information about the third train's duration of stay at the station.

Step 7: Calculate the arrival time of the fourth train. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, so the fourth train arrives:

{The fourth train arrives 20 minutes + (90 minutes) = 110 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival.}

Step 8: Determine the total time Paul waits for his train. The time Paul waits from the first train's scheduled arrival to the fourth train's arrival is:

{The total time Paul waits for his train = 0 minutes (first train leaves) + 20 minutes (first train's duration) + 30 minutes (second train's departure from the first train's departure) + 5 minutes (second train's duration) + 1 hour (third train's departure from the second train's departure) + 20 minutes (third train's duration) + 20 minutes (fourth train's arrival after the third train leaves) = 2 hours and 15 minutes = 135 minutes.}

{The final answer is: Paul waits for 135 minutes for his train.}</s>","The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.
So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate how many weeks it will take Melanie to save the remaining toothpicks at her current saving rate.
If Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, then it will take her:

                 [/INST] Let's reason through the problem step by step:

1. We know that Mr. Rogers bought the watch for 75% of its original price. Let X be the original price of the watch. Then, the price Mr. Rogers paid is 0.75X.

2. Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend for 120% of the price he paid. Let Y be the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend. Then, Y = 1.2 * (0.75X).

3. We're asked to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. To find a discount, we first need to find the cost that Mr. Rogers' friend paid, which is Y.

4. Since we have the equation Y = 1.2 * (0.75X), we can find Y by solving for Y:

   Y = 1.2 * (0.75X)
   Y = 0.9 * X (since 1.2 * 0.75 = 0.9)

5. Now, let's find the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid, which is the discount:

   Discount = X - Y

6. Substitute Y = 0.9 * X into the discount equation and solve for the discount:

   Discount = X - (0.9 * X)
   Discount = 0.1 * X

7. To find the percentage of the original price that the discount represents, divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100% (since percentages are ratios):

   Discount % = (Discount / Original Price) * 100%
                 = (0.1 * X / X) * 100%
                 = 10%

1. We know that one spring produces one jellyfish per second.
2. Therefore, five springs working at the same rate would produce five times as many jellyfish per second: 5 jellyfish per second.
3. To find out how many jellyfish are produced in 4 hours, we first need to find out how many seconds there are in 4 hours:
- We know that there are 60 seconds in 1 minute.
- There are 60 minutes in 1 hour.
- So, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in 1 hour.
- And there are 4 hours in 4 hours, so there are 4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds in 4 hours.
4. Now, since each spring produces 5 jellyfish per second, we can find out how many jellyfish 5 springs produce in 4 hours by multiplying the number of springs (5) by the number of jellyfish each spring produces per second (5) and the number of seconds in 4 hours (14400):
Jellyfish = Springs * Jellyfish per second * Seconds in 4 hours
= 5 * 5 * 14400
= 5 * 5 * (4 * 3600)

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of bananas in one bunch. If one banana costs $0.80, then the cost of a bunch of bananas that costs $3.00 is:
$3.00 / $0.80/banana = 3.75 bananas/bunch (approximately, since we can't buy a fraction of a bunch)

Step 2: Find the number of bananas Jenny bought in total. She bought 10 bunches and each bunch had approximately 4 bananas:
Total number of bananas = 10 bunches × 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas

Step 3: Find the cost of buying bananas individually. The cost of one banana is $0.80, so the cost of 40 bananas would be:
Cost of 40 bananas individually = 40 bananas × $0.80/banana = $32.00

Step 4: Find the cost of buying bananas in bunches. The cost of a bunch of bananas is $3.00, so the cost of 10 bunches would be:
Cost of 10 bunches = 10 bunches × $3.00/bunch = $30.00

Step 5: Find the amount of money saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually.
Saved money = Cost of 40 bananas individually - Cost of 10 bunches = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

{The final answer is: $2.00}</s>","Ten bunches makes 10*3=$<<10*3=30>>30.

                 [/INST] To solve this problem, let's first find out how much fence each person gets according to the given information.

1. Sam and Harry agree to split the fence equally. However, Harry is to get 60 feet more than Sam.
2. Let Sam's share of the fence be x feet. Then, Harry will get x + 60 feet.
3. Together, they have 100 feet of fence.
4. Therefore, x + x + 60 = 100
5. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 60 = 100
6. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 40
7. Dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence, and Harry gets 80 feet (20 + 60) of fence.

Now, to find out how much fence is left for Sam, we subtract Sam's share of the fence from the total amount:

1. Total fence length = 100 feet
2. Sam's share = 20 feet
3. Harry's share = 80 feet
4. Difference = Total - Sam's share - Harry's share
5. Difference = 100 - 20 - 80

{The final answer is 0 feet}. However, this answer doesn't seem correct in the context of the problem because the question states that Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them. So, the answer might be a mistake or there's a missing piece of information in the question that needs to be taken into account.</s>","Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100
Subtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40
We divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of bikes sold for each type.
- Number of Trekking bikes sold: Half of the total bikes sold = (1/2) * 300 = 150
- Number of BMX bikes sold: 15% of the total bikes sold = (1/10) * 300 = 30
- Number of MTB bikes sold: Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 30 = 120

Step 2: Calculate the income from selling each type of bike.
- Income from selling Trekking bikes: Price of one Trekking bike * Number of Trekking bikes sold = $450 * 150 = $67,500
- Income from selling BMX bikes: Price of one BMX bike * Number of BMX bikes sold = $250 * 30 = $7,500
- Income from selling MTB bikes: Price of one MTB bike * Number of MTB bikes sold = $500 * 120 = $60,000

Step 3: Find the total income Marcel earned during that month.
Total income = Income from selling Trekking bikes + Income from selling BMX bikes + Income from selling MTB bikes = $67,500 + $7,500 + $60,000 = $135,000

{The final answer is $135,000}</s>","First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.

Step 2: Calculate how many bales the truck picks up in an hour.
The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.

Step 3: Calculate how many hours it takes for the farmer to make as many bales as the truck can pick up in one hour.
It takes the farmer 1 hour to make 5 bales, so it takes the truck 1 hour to pick up 3 bales. To find out how long it takes the farmer to make as many bales as the truck can pick up in one hour, we divide the number of bales the truck can pick up in one hour by the number of bales the farmer makes in one hour.

Number of bales truck can pick up in 1 hour = 3 bales
Number of bales farmer makes in 1 hour = 5 bales

Time it takes the farmer to make as many bales as the truck can pick up in 1 hour = 3 bales / 5 bales = 3/5 hours

Step 4: Calculate how many bales the farmer makes in a 6 hour day.
The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in a 6 hour day, the farmer makes 6 hours/1 hour * 5 bales/hour = 30 bales.

Step 5: Calculate how many bales the truck picks up in a 6 hour day.
The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in a 6 hour day, the truck picks up 6 hours/1 hour * 3 bales/hour = 18 bales.

Step 6: Calculate how many bales are left in the field after a 6 hour day.
The farmer makes 30 bales in a 6 hour day and the truck picks up 18 bales, so there are 30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales of hay left in the field after a 6 hour day.

Extra classes: 2 classes/day * 5 days/week = 10 classes/week
Total classes: 30 classes/week (regular schedule) + 10 classes/week (extra classes) = 40 classes/week

Step 3: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on regular classes in a week.
Minutes for regular classes: 40 minutes/class * 30 classes/week = 1200 minutes/week

Step 4: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on extra classes in a week.
Minutes for extra classes: 40 minutes/class * 10 classes/week = 400 minutes/week

Step 5: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends learning each week.
Total minutes: 1200 minutes/week (regular classes) + 400 minutes/week (extra classes) = 1600 minutes/week

Step 6: Calculate the total number of hours John spends learning each week.
Total hours: 1600 minutes/week ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 26.67 hours/week

Since John cannot work more than 24 hours/day, we'll assume he spends his learning time evenly over the 7 days of the week (ignoring the discrepancy between 1600 minutes and the total possible minutes from working 26.67 hours/week).

The final answer is 26.67 hours/week. However, since John cannot physically work more than 24 hours/day, this calculation does not accurately represent the situation. We would need to adjust the number of minutes spent learning each day and adjust the number of classes accordingly. For example, instead of calculating 40 minutes of extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday, John could have 25 minutes of extra learning time on each weekday and 40 minutes on Saturday and Sunday. This would result in 35 hours/week of learning time, which is within the bounds of 24 hours/day * 7 days/week.

After taking these adjustments into account, the final answer is approximately 35 hours/week.</s>","He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day

                 [/INST] We are given that the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce, and the height of each story in the mall is 24 feet. Let's denote the initial height of the ball as H.

First, let's find the height of the first bounce:

Height of first bounce = H * (2/3)

Now, since the ball bounces back to 2/3rds of its previous height, the height of the second bounce will be:

Height of second bounce = Height of first bounce * (2/3)
                         = [H * (2/3)] * (2/3)

To find the actual height in feet, we need to find the value of H:

Given: Height of third-floor balcony = 3 * 24 = 72 feet

We know that the initial height of the ball is equal to the height of the third-floor balcony, so:

H = 72 feet.

Now, let's find the height of the second bounce:

Height of second bounce = [(72 feet) * (2/3)] * (2/3) = (128/9) * (2/3) = 32/3 feet

Number of bags = 2000 apples / 10 apples/bag
Number of bags = 200 bags

Step 2: Calculate the revenue earned from selling the bags of apples.
The revenue from selling one bag of apples is $5, so we can find the total revenue earned by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

Total revenue = Number of bags * Price per bag
Total revenue = 200 bags * $5/bag
Total revenue = $1000

                 [/INST] I. Understand the problem:
- A T-Rex ate half of a Triceratops, so the weight of the eaten part is half of the Triceratops' weight.
- Afterward, a pack of Velociraptors scavenged half of the remaining meat.
- Then, a group of Allosaurus consumed the last 270 kg of meat.
- The question is to find the weight of meat on the Triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

II. Solve the problem step by step:
1. Let's denote the weight of the Triceratops as 'x'. So, the weight of the meat eaten by the T-Rex is 'x/2'.
2. Half of the remaining meat (after T-Rex ate but before Velociraptors scavenged) was eaten by the Velociraptors. So, 'x/2 - x/2*0.5 = x/2 * 0.5 = x/4' is the weight of meat scavenged by Velociraptors.
3. After Velociraptors scavenged, the remaining weight of the meat eaten by Allosaurus is 'x/4 - 270 kg'.
4. The weight of the Triceratops should be greater than the final weight of the meat eaten by Allosaurus to ensure that there was enough meat initially for T-Rex, Velociraptors, and Allosaurus.
5. Therefore, 'x' > 'x/4 - 270 kg'.
6. Solving the inequality for 'x', we get 'x > 3 * 270 kg = 810 kg'.
7. Let's assume the weight of the Triceratops as '1000 kg' (a round number). So, 'x' = 1000 kg.
8. The final answer is 'The final answer is 1000 kg (or 1000000 kg in kilograms)'.</s>","The velociraptors left half for the Allosaurus, so the T-Rex left 2 * 270 = <<2*270=540>>540 kilograms of meat.

                 [/INST] To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we first need to determine how many shaken and unshaken sodas are left.

1. Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas.
2. She shook 3 of them, so there are now 12 - 3 = 9 unshaken sodas. She took 1 for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas.
3. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 11 shaken sodas and 8 unshaken sodas.
4. Ellen's friend comes along, and we want to know the probability that she picks up a shaken can and gets sprayed.

There are a total of 11 + 8 = 19 sodas left when Ellen's friend arrives. The number of shaken sodas is 11, and the number of unshaken sodas is 8.

We want to find the probability that Ellen's friend picks up a shaken can. The probability of an event occurring is the number of ways the event can occur divided by the total number of outcomes.

So, the probability that Ellen's friend picks up a shaken can = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of sodas
= 11 / 19

To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100:

Probability (%) = (11/19) x 100% = 57.89%

However, since probabilities are typically given as round numbers, it might be more common to say that there is approximately a 58% chance that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can.

{The final answer is: Approximately 58%}</s>","First figure out how many unshaken sodas were in the case when Ellen left the room: 12 total sodas - 3 shaken sodas - 1 taken soda = <<12-3-1=8>>8 unshaken sodas.
Next, figure out how many unshaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 unshaken sodas.
Then figure out how many shaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 shaken sodas.
Now add the number of shaken and unshaken sodas to find the total number of sodas left when Ellen's friend came along: 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 sodas
Now divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas to find the decimal probability Ellen's friend gets sprayed: 2/8 = <<2/8=0.25>>0.25
Now multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .25 * 100 = <<.25*100=25>>25%

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's understand the given information:
- Two trains depart from a station in opposite directions.
- The first train travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour (mph).
- The second train travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour (mph).

Step 2: Calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:
- The first train travels at a speed of 60 mph and Goes for a time of 3 hours. So, it covers a distance of 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles.
- The second train travels at a speed of 30 mph and Goes for a time of 3 hours. So, it covers a distance of 30 mph x 3 hours = 90 miles.

Step 3: Calculate the difference in their distances after 3 hours:
- The difference in their distances is the absolute value of the difference between the distance covered by the first train and the distance covered by the second train.
- That is, Distancedifference = |180 miles (first train) - 90 miles (second train)| = |90 miles (second train) - (-90 miles)| = 180 miles.

{The final answer is: The trains are 180 miles apart from each other after 3 hours.}</s>","Since one train is traveling half the speed of the train traveling 60 miles an hour, that means that train is traveling 60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 miles an hour.
Therefore, to find the distance traveled each hour in total we add both trains' speed together for a total of 60+30=<<90=90>>90 miles traveled each hour.
This means that in 3 hours they will have traveled 90*3= <<90*3=270>>270 miles away from each other.

Billy can help 2 people per hour.

Step 2: Calculate the number of people Billy can help in a day.
Billy works for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.

Step 3: Determine the total number of hours Billy works during the tax season.
He works for 3 hours/day * 30 days (assuming March has 30 days for simplicity) = 90 hours during March.
However, he takes 20% of the days off which is 20% * 30 = 6 days. So, he actually works for 90 hours - 6 hours/day * 6 days = 84 hours.

Step 4: Calculate the number of people Billy can help during the tax season.
Since he can help 6 people/day, the number of people he can help during 84 hours is 6 people/day * 84 hours/30 days * 30 days = 1728 people.

{The final answer is 1728 people.}</s>","First find the number of days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days

1. We know that Mary and John got married last weekend at a church.
2. There were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church.
3. After the ceremony, each bus carried 35 people, and each car carried 3 people.

To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to determine how many people were in the cars and the buses.

First, let's find out how many people were in the cars:

4. Each car carried 3 people, and there were 20 cars. So, the number of people in the cars is: 20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people.

Now, let's find out how many people were in the buses:

5. Each bus carried 35 people, and there were 12 buses. So, the number of people in the buses is: 12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people.

Adding the number of people in the cars and the buses, we have:

6. The total number of people inside the church is: 60 people (from the cars) + 420 people (from the buses) = 480 people.

Time for biggest slide = Distance / Speed
Time for biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute

Time for biggest slide = 5 minutes (since 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 hours / 60 minutes = 5 minutes)

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to ride the second biggest waterslide. People slide down this slide at a rate of 80 feet per minute, so we can calculate the time it takes to slide down a 240-feet-long slide:

Time for second biggest slide = Distance / Speed
Time for second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute

Time for second biggest slide = 3 minutes

Finally, we can find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest waterslide:

Step 2: Calculate the amount refunded for the returned item.
She returned an item costing $15.00.
{The amount refunded is $15.00}.

Step 3: Find the cost of the new purchases.
a) The price of the frying pan before the discount is $20.00. With a 20% discount, the cost of the frying pan is $20.00 - 20% of $20.00 = $16.00.
b) The cost of the set of towels before the discount is $30.00. With a 10% discount, the cost of the set of towels is $30.00 - 10% of $30.00 = $27.00.

1. We know that ""A jellyfish tank"" has numerous jellyfish in it.
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large: if N is the total number of jellyfish, then 1/5 * N = number of large jellyfish.
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color to blue under UV light: if L is the number of large jellyfish, then 1/3 * L = number of large jellyfish that change color.
4. We observe that 6 jellyfish change color when the UV light is turned on. These must be the large jellyfish that change color.
5. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, we have 1/3 * L = 6. Solving the equation, we get L = 6 * 3 = 18. So, there are 18 large jellyfish.
6. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. We're not given any information about their number.

                 [/INST] To find out how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for a retirement period of 20 years with 40% of her current salary, we can use the following steps:

Step 1: Find out how much Lauren needs to save annually for her retirement.
She wants to have 40% of her current salary during retirement, so she needs to save an amount equivalent to 60% of her current salary (100% - 40% = 60%).

Step 2: Find out how much Lauren saves annually.
Lauren saves 20% of every paycheck. We need to find out what percentage of her annual salary this represents. If she earns $100,000 annually, then she saves $20,000 (20% of $100,000) each year.

Step 3: Determine how many years she needs to work based on her current savings rate.
To find out how many years she currently needs to work to save enough for a 20-year retirement, we can divide her current annual savings by how much she needs to save annually.

Let's calculate:

Step 1: Lauren needs to save $60,000 annually.
Step 2: Lauren saves $20,000 annually.

Step 3: Find the number of years Lauren needs to work based on her current savings rate.
We need to find out how long it would take for her to reach her goal of saving $60,000 annually if she continues to save $20,000 annually.

We can calculate this by dividing the amount to be saved ($60,000) by the annual savings ($20,000):

Number of years = Total savings goal / Annual savings
Number of years = $60,000 / $20,000

Number of years = 3 years

However, this calculation only considers Lauren's current savings rate. To find out how many more years she needs to work in total, we also need to account for the number of years she has already worked.

Let's assume Lauren has already worked for X number of years. Her total savings would then be $20,000 * (X + 3), where X is the number of years she has already worked, and 3 is the number of years she would need to work based on her current savings rate.

To find out the total number of years Lauren needs to work, we need to find the value of X that makes her total savings equal to 20 years worth of her desired retirement income ($200,000).

We can set up the equation:

$20,000 * (X + 3) = $200,000

Solving for X:

$20,000 * (X + 3) = $200,000
X + 3 = 10
X = 7 years

So, Lauren has already worked for 7 years. To find out how many more years she needs to work, we subtract the number of years she has already worked from the total number of years she needs to work:

Total number of years = Years already worked + Additional years needed
Total number of years = 7 + 3

Total number of years = 10 years

Therefore, {The final answer is: Lauren needs to work for a total of 10 years to reach her retirement savings goal.}</s>","Lauren plans to live in retirement with 40% of her current salary ($100,000), therefore 40%*$100,000 = $<<40*.01*100000=40000>>40,000
If she wants to save for 20 years, then she will need to save 20 * $40,000 = $<<20*40000=800000>>800,000 to retire
If her current salary is $100,00 and she's saving 20%, then she's able to save $100,000 * 20% = $<<100000*20*.01=20000>>20,000 every year
To reach her desired savings goal ($800,000) she will need to work for another $800,000/$20,000 = <<800000/20000=40>>40 years

Step 1: Find the total school population:
If 40% of the school population are 240 boys, then 60% of the school population are girls.

Total school population = Number of boys / Percentage of boys
Total school population = 240 / 0.4 = 600

Step 2: Find the number of girls:
Since 60% of the total school population are girls, the number of girls is:

Number of girls = Total school population * Percentage of girls
Number of girls = 600 * 0.6 = 360

{The final answer is: There are 360 girls in the school.}</s>","100% - 40% = 60% of the school's population are girls.

2. The women wearing 4-inch heels represent a group with a total height of 3 * 4 inches = <<3*4=12>>12 inches.
3. The women wearing 2-inch heels represent a group with a total height of 3 * 2 inches = <<3*2=6>>6 inches.

5. The total number of women at the party is 6.
6. To find the average height, divide the total height by the total number of women: 18 inches / 6 women = <<18/6=3>>3 inches (on average, each woman is wearing heels that are 3 inches tall).

                 [/INST] To find out how many more miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her 9,300-mile journey in the month of June, we first need to determine how many days she has during her vacation and then calculate how many miles she can cover each day based on her plan of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.

1. Soledad is on vacation for the entire month of June. There are 30 days in a typical month, so:
   Number of days in June = 30

2. Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
   Miles covered in one day = 125 miles * 2
   Miles covered in one day = 250 miles

3. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day to reach her target of 9,300 miles, we need to calculate the difference between the number of miles she plans to cover and the number of miles she needs to cover:
   Miles needed to hike in June = Total miles in June - Miles covered in June
   Miles needed to hike in June = 9,300 miles - 250 miles/day * 30 days

   First, calculate the miles covered in June:
   250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles

   Now, find the difference:
   9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles

So, we've calculated that Soledad needs to hike an additional 1,800 miles during her vacation. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we can divide the total number of miles she needs to cover by the number of days she has:

Additional miles per day = Total miles she needs to hike / Number of days in June
Additional miles per day = 1,800 miles / 30 days

Additional miles per day ≈ 60 miles/day

It seems there is an error in the problem statement as the numbers provided don't add up to the concluded 9,300 miles. It might not be possible to cover this mileage with just 250 miles per day, so it's important to scrutinize problem statements and double-check arithmetic before engaging in lengthy calculations.

Final answer: { The calculation indicates that Soledad needs to hike approximately 60 miles per day to cover 9,300 miles in a month, but upon reviewing the initial problem statement and checking the arithmetic, it seems there might be an inconsistency with the numbers provided. }</s>","June has 30 days, so Soledad must hike 9,300 miles / 30 days = <<9300/30=310>>310 miles/day

To complete her journey, she must increase her hike by 310 miles/day - 250 miles/day = 60 miles/day

3. Paul wants 1/3 of the total, so he will have 12 kg * (1/3) = 4 kg.
4. Therefore, Pierre and Paul have together taken 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find out how long it takes for the light to blink once, and then use that information to calculate how long it takes for 459 blinks.

Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can find the time it takes for one blink by dividing the total time by the number of blinks:

Time for one blink = Total time / Number of blinks
Time for one blink = 5 minutes / 255

To find the time for one blink in minutes, we'll convert the result to a decimal number, and then multiply it by 60:

Time for one blink = 5 / 255
Time for one blink = 0.019684134511713187 minutes

Time for one blink = 0.019684134511713187 * 60 minutes
Time for one blink = 0.118104411 minutes

So, the light takes approximately 0.118 minutes to blink once.

Now, let's find how long it takes for 459 blinks:

Time for 459 blinks = Number of blinks * Time for one blink
Time for 459 blinks = 459 * 0.118 minutes

Therefore, the final answer is approximately 53.14 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

{The final answer is 53.14 minutes}</s>","The lighthouse blinks 255 / 5 = <<255/5=51>>51 times per minute.
It takes 459 / 51 = <<459/51=9>>9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

How many , toys per hour ? does the fifth ! worker ; produce?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. First, let's find out how many toys can be produced by each group of workers in an hour.
2. group of 2 workers producing 6 toys an hour = 6 toys/hour
3. group of 2 workers producing 4 toys an hour = 4 toys/hour
4. Total production per hour from both groups = 6 toys/hour + 4 toys/hour = 10 toys/hour

5. In a 10-hour shift, the first two groups of workers can produce a total of 10 toys/hour * 10 hours = 100 toys.

6. The manufacturer still needs to produce 20 more toys to meet the order. So, the total number of toys to be produced is 100 toys (from the first two groups) + 20 toys = 120 toys.

7. Since the first two groups can produce a total of 10 toys/hour, they would need 120 toys / 10 toys/hour = 12 hours to produce all the toys required.

8. However, they have only a 10-hour shift. Thus, the manufacturer needs to find an additional worker to help complete the order.

9. The manufacturer has one more worker available (the fifth worker). To determine how many toys this worker needs to produce per hour to meet the goal, we need to find the number of extra toys that need to be produced during the existing 10-hour shift.

10. Let x be the toys produced per hour by the fifth worker.
11. In the remaining hours of the shift (10 hours - hours worked by first two groups = 10 hours - 2 * 10 hours = 0 hours), the fifth worker must produce the number of toys to make up the difference between the number of toys already produced and the total required.

12. From the previous calculations, we know that the total number of toys required is 120 toys. Since the first two groups have already produced 100 toys, the fifth worker needs to produce an additional 120 - 100 = 20 toys.

13. To find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce per hour, divide the total number of toys the fifth worker must produce by the number of hours left in the shift: 20 toys / remaining hours = 20 toys / 0 hours

14. Since the denominator can't be equal to zero, this calculation implies that the problem contains incorrect or inconsistent information. To find a valid solution, the manufacturer would need to hire an additional worker or extend the work hours of the existing workers to meet the order's requirements.

{The final answer cannot be determined as provided information is inconsistent.}</s>","In the first group of workers, each produces 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys.
In the second group of workers, each produces 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys.
Together, these two groups produce 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys.
If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.
The fifth worker therefore produced 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.

1. We know that one of Elijah's dogs is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog.
2. Therefore, the weight of Elijah's dog is (1/4) * 60 pounds = 15 pounds.
3. The weight of the other dog is half the weight of Kory's dog.
4. So, the weight of the other dog is 0.5 * 60 pounds = 30 pounds.

Step 2: Find the total weight of the dogs owned by Elijah.
Total weight of dogs for Elijah = Weight of one dog + Weight of another dog

Step 3: Add the weight of Elijah's dogs to the weight of Kory's dog to find their total weight collectively.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as S.

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received S/2 stickers.
2. Luis gave half of the stickers he received to Kristina, so Kristina received (S/2)/2 = S/4 stickers.
3. Kristina kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. So, Rob received S/4 - 9 + 7 = S/4 - 2 stickers.

Since we know that Rob received (S/4) - 2 stickers, we can write an equation:

(S/4) - 2 = Number of stickers Rob received

We want to find the initial number of stickers Seth had (S). We know that Rob received (S/4) - 2 stickers, but we need to find the value of S.

We will begin by finding the value of (S/4) and then subtracting 2:

1. Rob received (S/4) - 2 stickers, so S/4 = Rob's stickers + 2
2. S/4 = (Rob's stickers + 2)
3. Multiply both sides of the equation by 4: S = 4 * (Rob's stickers + 2) \(S = 4(Rob's\ stickers + 2)\)

Now we have an equation. The question doesn't provide information about the number of stickers Rob had, so unfortunately, we cannot solve this problem without more information. Therefore, without sufficient information, it is impossible to determine the exact number of stickers Seth had originally.

However, the equation we have derived is a start and may hold value in other contexts where the number of stickers Rob had is known.

An large bag weighs 10 ounces and one ounce contains 30 M&M's. Therefore, each large bag contains:
10 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 300 M&M's

Step 2: Find out how many M&M's are in a small bag.
Each small bag contains 10 ounces, so it contains:
10 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 300 M&M's

Step 3: Find out how many small bags can be made from the M&M's in one large bag.
There are 300 M&M's in one large bag, and there are 300 M&M's in each small bag. Therefore, you can make:
300 M&M's in one small bag / 300 M&M's in one small bag = 1 small bag

So, one large bag of M&M's can be used to make:
300 M&M's in one large bag / 300 M&M's in one small bag = 1 small bag

Since John buys 3 large bags, he can make:
1 small bag per large bag * 3 large bags = 3 small bags.

Step 1: Calculate half of the Earth's circumference.
Half of the Earth's circumference = Total circumference / 2
Half of the Earth's circumference = 40,000 km / 2
Half of the Earth's circumference = 20,000 km

Step 2: Calculate how many days it takes Alfie to cover this distance.
Days = Distance / Daily flying distance
Days = 20,000 km / 400 km
Days = 50

So, Alfie would need 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the Earth's circumference.

1. The second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So its speed is 5x hours.
2. The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car. So its speed is 1.25 * 5x = 6.25x hours.

Therefore, the speed of the faster car is 6.25 times the speed of the average car. since the average car goes 120 Miles per hour, We can calculate the speed of the faster car as:

                 [/INST] To find the age of Vince now, let's follow these steps:

1. We know that two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's represent Liam's age as ""L"" and Vince's age as ""V"". Thus, we have: L = 2V - 2 (Since two years have passed since then).

2. Now, we know that Liam is currently 16 years old. So, we can set up the equation: L = 16.

3. Substitute L = 16 into the equation we derived in step 1: 16 = 2V - 2.

4. To solve for V, first add 2 to both sides: 18 = 2V.

5. Then, divide both sides by 2 to find the value of V: V = 9.

{The final answer is: Vince is currently 9 years old.}</s>","Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = <<16-2=14>>14 years old.
Vince's age two years ago was 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 years old because Liam's age is twice his.
So Vince age now is 7 + 2 = <<7+2=9>>9 years old.

1. Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.
2. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
3. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
4. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

To find out how many eggs Camden painted compared to Arnold, we first need to find out how many eggs each of them painted. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number, we know that:

- Arnold and Madeline painted x eggs each

And from the information given about Camden and Sarah:

- Camden painted x + 12 eggs
- Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs

We can set up an equation to find the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline, and then use that to find the difference in eggs painted by Camden and Arnold:

x + x + (x + 12) = 56 # Total number of eggs
2x + x + 12 = 56
3x + 12 = 56
3x = 44
x = 14.67 (This doesn't make sense as we can't have a fraction of an egg)

This suggests that there may be an error in the problem statement as it's not possible for a group to paint a fraction of an egg. However, assuming the group painted 56 whole eggs, we can conclude that:

- Arnold and Madeline painted 14 eggs each (28 eggs in total)
- Camden painted 14 + 12 = 26 eggs more than Arnold

Therefore, {The final answer is: Camden painted 26 more eggs than Arnold}.</s>","Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = <<56-30=26>>26 easter eggs.
Arnold and Madeline each painted 26/2 = <<26/2=13>>13 easter eggs.

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
Number of boxes = 200 / 8
Number of boxes = 25 boxes

Step 2: Calculate the weight of the crayons.
Total weight of crayons = Number of crayons * Weight of each crayon
Total weight of crayons = 200 * 1 oz
Total weight of crayons = 200 oz

Step 3: Convert the weight of the crayons from ounces to pounds, since the question asks for the total weight in pounds.
Total weight of crayons in pounds = Total weight of crayons / Number of ounces per pound
Total weight of crayons in pounds = 200 oz / 16 oz
Total weight of crayons in pounds = 12.5 pounds

Step 4: Calculate the weight of the empty boxes.
Each box weighs 8 oz. Since there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is:
Weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
Weight of boxes = 25 * 8 oz
Weight of boxes = 200 oz

Step 5: Convert the weight of the boxes from ounces to pounds.
Weight of boxes in pounds = Weight of boxes / Number of ounces per pound
Weight of boxes in pounds = 200 oz / 16 oz
Weight of boxes in pounds = 12.5 pounds

Step 6: Calculate the total weight of crayons and boxes in pounds.
Total weight = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
Total weight = 12.5 pounds (crayons) + 12.5 pounds (boxes)
Total weight = 25 pounds

Step 2: He can make logs out of 80% of it. So, the total length of logs will be: 80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Step 3: He cuts each log into 4-foot pieces. So, the number of planks he gets from one log is: 64 / 4 = 16

Step 4: From each of these planks, he cuts 5 smaller planks. So, the total number of small planks he gets from one large plank is: 1 + 5 = 6

Step 5: He sells each small plank for $1.2. To find the total amount of money he makes from selling all the small planks, we first need to find the total number of small planks. Since there are 16 large planks and each large plank produces 6 small planks: 16 * 6 = 96 small planks

Step 2: Their mother's monthly salary is given as twice their combined salary. So, their combined salary is (X + X/2).

Step 3: To find their mother's monthly salary, we need to multiply their combined salary by 2: Their mother's monthly salary = 2 * (X + X/2)

Step 4: Simplifying the term inside the parentheses, Their mother's monthly salary = 2 * (X + X/2) => 2 * (2X/2) => 3X

Step 5: Now, we know that Valerie earns X/2, and her brother earns X, so their combined monthly salary is X + X/2. We can rewrite this as X + X/2 => X(1 + 1/2) => X(2/2) => 2X/2 => X (since 2X/2 equals X + X/2).

Step 6: To calculate the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual monthly salaries: Total amount of money = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary + Their mother's salary => (X/2) + X + 3X.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite trail, which includes 2 miles of walking on the beach and 1 mile of walking on the sidewalk.
2. On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of her speed on the beach. Let's denote her speed on the beach as s miles per hour (mph). Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2s mph.
3. We are given that 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. Let's convert this value into miles and hours. Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach:
   - Distance covered on the beach = 2 miles
   - Time spent on the beach = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / s hours or (2 miles) / (s mph) = (2 miles) / (s hours) = (2 miles) / 60 minutes / (s hours) = 1/3 hours if s is in hours
4. Therefore, the time spent on the sidewalk is total walk time - time spent on the beach = 3 miles / s hours - 1/3 hours = 5/3 hours = 1 hour and 55.55 minutes (since the time is not given in decimal minutes in the question, we'll disregard the fractional part).
5. Since we know Grandma's speed on the sidewalk is 2s mph and she covers 1 mile on the sidewalk:
   - Distance covered on the sidewalk = 1 mile
   - Time spent on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 2s hours = 1/2 hours or 30 minutes
6. To verify the calculation, we can check the total walk time spent on both the beach and the sidewalk:
   - Beach time = 1/3 hours = 20 minutes
   - Sidewalk time = 1/2 hours = 30 minutes
   - Total walk time = 20 minutes (beach) + 30 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes = 1 hour = 60 minutes
7. Since Grandma's speed is the same on both miles of the sidewalk, her total walking time in minutes for the entire 3 miles is 60 minutes. {The final answer is: It takes Grandma 1 hour (or 60 minutes) to complete the entire 3-mile walk.}</s>","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.

Step 1: Calculate how much Jane has saved after 8 weeks.
$4 saved per week * 8 weeks = $32

Step 2: Determine how much more money Jane needs to save in total.
$60 saved in total - $32 saved already = $28

Step 3: Divide the amount she still needs to save by the amount she saves each week to find out how many more weeks it will take.
$28 needed / $4 saved per week = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane an additional 7 weeks to save $60.

1. Donny can only drink water that is at least 40 degrees.
2. He has two mugs of water, one of which is 33 degrees.
3. Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug.
4. After making this transfer, Donny is able to drink the water, which means the temperature of the water in his water bottle is now at least 40 degrees.
5. To determine the temperature of the second mug, we need to find the initial temperature of the water in both mugs and the change in temperature due to the transfer.
6. Let's denote the initial temperature of the unknown mug as X.
7. The temperature difference between the two mugs before the transfer is |33 - X| degrees.
8. The 4-ounce transfer from the 33-degree mug causes a drop in temperature, and the 1-ounce transfer from the unknown mug causes a rise in temperature.
9. The final temperature in Donny's water bottle can be calculated as: (33 * 4 + X * 1) / (4 + 1) = 31.33 * T, where T is the temperature of the second mug in degrees Fahrenheit.
10. Since Donny can now drink the water in the water bottle, which means the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Thus, 31.33 * T ≥ 40, which simplifies to T ≥ 127.14 degrees Fahrenheit.
11. It is important to note that this calculation only sets a lower bound for the temperature of the second mug, as there might be other factors that could influence the final temperature, such as heat loss to the environment.

Therefore, the second bottle must be at least 127.14 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter for Donny to be able to drink the water after the transfer.

Total animals = Initial number of animals + Number of animals received from Milkie Cows Limited + Number of animals received from Broilers Limited

Total animals = 50 cows + 20 cows + 210 chickens + 20 chickens
Total animals = 51 cows + 212 chickens

The final answer is: 51 cows and 212 chickens, for a total of 563 animals.</s>","Animals were brought to the farm for three weeks, which is 3*7 = <<3*7=21>>21 days.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we need to find the difference between 23 and 5 to get the number of scoops Gomer ate.
   The difference between 23 and 5 is: 23 - 5 = 18

2. Now, we know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We need to find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop.
   We know that 3 less than 6 potatoes make 1 less than 3 scoops, so we have the following equation: (6 - 3) potatoes = (3 - 1) scoops
   Simplifying the equation, we have: 3 potatoes = 2 scoops

3. To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to calculate the number of potatoes in the total number of scoops he ate.
   We know that 1 scoop is equal to 3 potatoes, so the number of potatoes in the total number of scoops Gomer ate is: 18 scoops * 3 potatoes/scoop = 54 potatoes

So, the final answer is: {Gomer ate 54 potatoes}.</s>","5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes is 23-5=<<23-5=18>>18 scoops of mashed potatoes.
3 less than 6 potatoes is 6-3=<<6-3=3>>3 potatoes.
1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes is 3-1=<<3-1=2>>2 scoops of mashed potatoes.
Thus, if Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, and it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, then Gomer ate 18*(3/2)=<<18*(3/2)=27>>27 potatoes.

                 [/INST] To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we first need to calculate how many eggs he consumes in total during the 30-day periods when he eats 3 eggs and 5 eggs a day, respectively.

For the first 30 days, Chester consumes 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs he needs is:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

The number of eggs in a dozen is 12. So the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs for 30 days when he eats 3 eggs a day is:
90 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7.5 dozens. Since we can't have half a dozen, we'll round up to 8 dozens.

For the next 30 days, Chester consumes 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs he needs is:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

So the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs for 30 days when he eats 5 eggs a day is:
150 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 12.5 dozens. Again, we can't have half a dozen, so we'll round up to 13 dozens.

To find the total number of dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we add the number of dozens he needed during both 30-day periods:
8 dozens (for the first 30 days) + 13 dozens (for the second 30 days) = 21 dozens

Therefore, {The final answer is 21 dozens of eggs for Chester to consume eggs for 60 days}.</s>","He starts off eating 3 eggs a day for 30 days for a total of 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 eggs

1. We know that there are 17 green jellybeans.
2. There are twice as many red jellybeans, so there are 2 * 17 = 34 red jellybeans.
3. The total number of jellybeans is 60.So the number of blue jellybeans = total - (green + red)

                 [/INST] To solve this problem, let's first find out how many men and women were initially on the bus based on the given ratio.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. We can write this ratio as a fraction:

Men / Women = 5 / 9

To find the number of men and women on the bus when the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up a proportion:

5men / 9women = xmen / 84

Where x is the number of total passengers. Solving this proportion for women, we get:

women = (9x / 5)

Substituting the value of the total number of passengers (x = 84), we get:

women = (9 * 84) / 5 = 138.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round this up to 139 women.

Next, we find out how many women alighted from the bus at the next stop. We're told that 20 women left the bus. So, now there are:

Remaining women = Initial women - Women alighted
= 139 - 20
= 119 women

So, {The final answer is 119 women remaining on the bus.}</s>","The total ratio representing the number of women on the bus is 5+9=<<5+9=14>>14
The fraction from the ratio representing the number of women is 9/14, and since the total number of passengers representing the full ratio is 84, there are 9/14*84=<<9/14*84=54>>54 women on the bus.
If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus becomes 54-20=<<54-20=34>>34

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that the price of each sunflower is $2, and a bouquet contains 12 sunflowers with a cost of $8. To find the number of sunflowers sold in one bouquet, we can calculate the cost of sunflowers in a bouquet and then divide it by the cost of one sunflower:

Cost of sunflowers in a bouquet = Cost of one bouquet
Cost of one bouquet = $8

Number of sunflowers in a bouquet = Cost of sunflowers in a bouquet / Cost of one sunflower
Number of sunflowers in a bouquet = $8 / $2
Number of sunflowers in a bouquet = 4 sunflowers * 12 (since there are 12 sunflowers in a bouquet)
Number of sunflowers in a bouquet = 48 sunflowers

Step 2: We know that Faraday earned $26 from selling sunflowers and $56 from selling bouquets per day. We can calculate the number of sunflowers sold as sunflowers, by finding the ratio of sunflowers sold through sunflowers and bouquets. Since each bouquet contains 48 sunflowers, we can find the number of sunflowers sold through bouquets, and then determine the number of sunflowers sold as individual sunflowers.

Sunflowers sold through bouquets per day = $56 / $8 (the cost difference between one bouquet and sunflowers)
Sunflowers sold through bouquets per day = 7 sunflowers * 48 (since there are 7 increments of cost difference between sunflowers and a bouquet)
Sunflowers sold through bouquets per day = 336 sunflowers

Sunflowers sold as individual sunflowers per day = Sunflowers sold per day (all methods) - Sunflowers sold through bouquets per day
Sunflowers sold as individual sunflowers per day = 26 + 336 - 3 * 48
Sunflowers sold as individual sunflowers per day = 221

Step 3: To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to multiply the number of sunflowers sold daily by the number of days:

Sunflowers sold after 3 days = Sunflowers sold per day * Number of days
Sunflowers sold after 3 days = 221 * 3 days
Sunflowers sold after 3 days = 663 sunflowers

{The final answer is: 663 sunflowers}</s>","Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.
So he was able to sell a total of 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 sunflowers from the bouquets.
And he was able to sell a total of $26/$2= <<26/2=13>>13 Sunflowers.
The sum of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell is 84 + 13 = <<84+13=97>>97.
Therefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 3 days is 97 x 3 = <<97*3=291>>291.

                 [/INST] To find Sid's average speed during the first leg of the trip, we need to find his speed traveling 110 miles in 2 hours:

1. First, we need to find Sid's speed during the first 2 hours:
speed = distance / time
speed = 110 miles / 2 hours
speed = 55 miles per hour {The first segment of Sid's trip was at a speed of 55 mph}.

To find Sid's average speed during the entire trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken:

1. Distance traveled in the first 2 hours: 110 miles.
2. During the second leg of the trip, Sid traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours.
3. So, the total distance traveled is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.
4. The total time taken is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.
5. Now, we can find Sid's average speed during the entire trip:
average speed = total distance / total time
average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
average speed = 50 miles per hour {The final answer is: Sid's average speed during the entire trip was 50 mph}.</s>","After traveling 110 miles at first, Sid traveled 110 + 140 = <<110+140=250>>250 miles in total
Since he spends 3 hours traveling after the first 2 hours, he traveled 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 hours
On average, Sid traveled 250 miles / 5 hours = <<250/5=50>>50 miles per hour.

Step 1: The probability that the first ticket wins = 20% (given in the problem)

Step 2: The probability that the second ticket wins, given that the first ticket won, is unknown. Let's call it p. Since the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, we can write:

p = 3 * (probability of first ticket winning)
p = 3 * 0.2
p = 0.6

Step 3: The probability that both tickets are winners = probability of first ticket winning * probability of second ticket winning
= 0.2 * 0.6
= 0.12 or 12%

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

Step 2: We also know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. So, Jim collected c + 5 seashells.

Step 3: After gathering all the seashells, they divided them equally between themselves. Let's assume there were a total of ""t"" seashells collected among the three.

Step 4: According to the problem, the three of them divided the seashells equally. Therefore, each person got an equal share of the total number of seashells: t / 3

Step 5: However, we don't have a definite value for the total number of seashells (t). We only know that Carlos collected 2c and Jim collected c + 5.

Step 6: To find the total number of seashells, we need to find the sum of what Carlos and Carrey collected and then add Jim's seashells to that: 2c (Carlos) + c (Carrey) + (c + 5) (Jim)

Step 7: Combining the terms for Carlos and Carrey, we get: 3c. Then, adding Jim's seashells, we have: 3c + (c + 5) = 3c + c + 5 = 4c + 5

Step 8: Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, we can represent the number of seashells Carrey collected with the variable ""x"". So, x = c for this problem.

Step 9: Substituting x for c in Step 6, we have: 4x + 5

Step 10: Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to find a definite value for x. Thus, we cannot calculate the exact number of seashells each person got.

                 [/INST] To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we first need to find out how many carrots he eats on weekdays and on weekends separately, and then add those amounts together.

On weekdays, Mason eats 4 carrots, so:
Carrots eaten on weekdays = 4 carrots/day * 5 days/week

On Saturdays and Sundays, Mason eats 5 carrots, so:
Carrots eaten on weekends = 5 carrots/day * 2 days/week

Now we can add the amount of carrots Mason eats on weekdays to the amount he eats on weekends to find the total:

Total carrots eaten in a week = Carrots eaten on weekdays + Carrots eaten on weekends

Substituting the expressions we found earlier into this equation:

Total carrots eaten in a week = (4 carrots/day * 5 days/week) + (5 carrots/day * 2 days/week)

To simplify this expression, we can first calculate the number of carrots Mason eats in one week for each day of the week (weekdays and weekends), and then add those amounts together:

Carrots eaten in a week = (4 carrots/day * 5 days/week) + (5 carrots/day * 2 days/week)
= (20 carrots/week) + (10 carrots/week)

1. The first song on the cassette is 5 minutes long.
2. The second song is 60% longer than the first song.
3. To find the length of the second song, we can find 60% of the first song's length and add it to the first song's length.

The length of the second song = First song's length + (First song's length * 60%)

Let's calculate:

The length of the second song = 5 minutes + (5 minutes * 0.6)

The length of the second song = 5 minutes + (3 minutes)

The length of the second song = 8 minutes

Therefore, the total length of the cassette is:

Total length = Length of first song + Length of second song

Total length = 5 minutes + 8 minutes

The final answer is: 13 minutes.</s>","The second song is 5*.6=<<5*.6=3>>3 minutes longer than the first

Let's define the following variables for the problem:
- x: the original price of one mobile device

Step 2: Solve for the selling price of one device.
Linus buys each device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price. So, the selling price of one device is 2 × $20 = $40.

Step 3: Calculate the number of devices bought on each day.
Last Monday, Linus bought 2 devices. Last Tuesday, he bought 4 devices.

Step 4: Calculate the profit from selling devices bought on each day.
The profit from selling one device is the difference between the selling price and the original price. So, the profit from selling one device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since Linus bought 2 devices on Monday, the profit from selling all devices bought on Monday is 2 × $20 = $40. Similarly, since he bought 4 devices on Tuesday, the profit from selling all devices bought on Tuesday is 4 × $20 = $80.

Step 5: Calculate the total profit.
The total profit earned by Linus is the profit from selling devices bought on Monday plus the profit from selling devices bought on Tuesday.
The total profit = $40 (selling all devices bought on Monday) + $80 (selling all devices bought on Tuesday) = $120.

{The final answer is: $120}</s>","The total cost for the devices he bought on Monday is 2*20= <<2*20=40>>40

                 [/INST] Step 1: We are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, and Carl is one foot taller than his brother Ned. Let's represent the height of Carl with the variable ""h"" in feet. Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we can represent the length of Carl's cane with the variable ""c"" in feet:

c = 0.5 * h

Step 2: We are also given that Ned is one foot shorter than Carl. So we have:

h (Carl) > h (Ned)
h (Carl) = h (Ned) + 1 foot

Step 3: We are then given that Ned is two feet shorter than his cousin Isabel, and Isabel is 7 feet tall:

h (Isabel) > h (Ned)
h (Isabel) = h (Ned) + 2 feet

Step 4: Since h (Carl) > h (Ned), and h (Ned) < h (Isabel), we can conclude that h (Carl) > h (Isabel):

h (Carl) > h (Isabel)

This information is not directly useful in finding the length of Carl's cane, but it is important to understand the relationships between their heights.

Step 5: Given that c = 0.5 * h, we want to find the length of Carl's cane. Since h is already in feet, there is no need to convert the measurement of Carl's cane to feet. Thus, we can find the length of Carl's cane directly from the given information:

c = 0.5 * h

{The final answer is: The length of Carl's cane is 0.5 times Carl's height in feet.}</s>","If Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, then Ned is 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 feet tall.

1. Calculate the number of bottles required for one person:
   - Daily energy need for one person: Unknown
   - Number of bottles required to cover 20% of one person's daily energy need: 20% of daily energy need / number of bottles per bottle

2. We don't have the daily energy need for one person given in the problem, so let's assume a daily energy need of x calories, and convert that into a number of bottles needed. For simplicity, let's assume 100 calories = 1 bottle (this may not be accurate, as the caloric content of carrot juice can vary).

   - Daily energy need for one person: x calories
   - Number of bottles required to cover 20% of one person's daily energy need: x calories / (100 calories/bottle)

3. Now that we have the number of bottles required for one person, we can calculate how many more bottles are needed for 2300 people.

   - Number of bottles required for 2300 people: (x calories / (100 calories/bottle)) * 2300

4. However, we still don't have a value for x (the daily energy need of one person) in the problem, so we cannot calculate an exact answer.

2. 1/4 of the octuplets wear blue outfits, so there are 2 blue-wearers (since 1/4 of 8 is 2).
3. The remaining 3/4 of the octuplets wear purple outfits, so there are 6 purple-wearers.
4. We're told that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows.
5. Since there are 2 blue-wearers, there are 2 blue-wearers with bows.
6. We're given that 1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows. So, let's find out how many purple-wearers with bows there are. 1/3 of 6 is equivalent to 2, so there are 2 purple-wearers with bows.
7. In total, there are 2 blue-wearers with bows + 2 purple-wearers with bows = 4 babies wearing bows.

3. To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we can calculate the percentage of purple-wearers with bows out of the total number of babies with bows.
4. The percentage chance = (Number of purple-wearers with bows / Total number of babies with bows) × 100%

First, let's find out how many reports were received on Monday and Tuesday. The problem states that they received a total of 1907 reports on these two days.

Next, we need to find out how many reports were received on Thursday and Friday. The problem states that they received a total of 2136 reports on these two days.

Now, we can subtract the number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week to find out how many reports were received on Wednesday.

The total number of reports received last week was 5168. So,

2. He sold half of the land for $50, so the area sold was 80 sq.m * 0.5 = 40 sq.m.
3. One month later, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. So, the area sold was 80 sq.m * 0.25 = 20 sq.m.
4. The remaining land that Abraham had was 80 sq.m - 40 sq.m - 20 sq.m = 20 sq.m.
5. He sold the remaining 20 sq.m of land for $3 per sq.m.
6. To find out how much money he earned from selling this last portion of land, we multiply the area (in sq.m) by the price per sq.m: 20 sq.m * $3/sq.m = $60.

8. To find the total amount of money Abraham earned, we add the earnings from all the land sales: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

{The final answer is: Abraham will earn a total of $140 after selling all his unused land.}</s>","Abraham sold 1/2 x 80= <<1/2*80=40>>40 square meters of his unused land.
After a month, he sold 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 square meters of his land.
So, the total land he already sold is 40+10= <<50=50>>50 square meters of his land.
He has 80 - 50 = <<80-50=30>>30 remaining land to be sold at $3 per square meter.
So he earned $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90 for that land.
Therefore, he earned a total of $50 + $30 + $90 = $<<50+30+90=170>>170.

                 [/INST] To find the age of Geb, we first need to find the age of Haley and then determine Geb's age based on the given relationship.

Step 1: Find Haley's age:
Haley is 26 years old.

Step 2: Find Geb's age based on the relationship:
Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age.

Let's find half of Haley's age:
Half of Haley's age = Haley's age / 2
Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2
Half of Haley's age = 13

Now, we know Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so:

Geb's age = Half of Haley's age - 10
Geb's age = 13 - 10
Geb's age = 3

So, the final answer is: Geb is 3 years old.</s>","Half of Haley's age is 26/2 = <<26/2=13>>13.

                 [/INST] Let's begin by giving names to the number of eggs found by each person:

- Cole hid x eggs
- Lamar found y eggs
- Stacy found z eggs
- Charlie found w eggs
- Mei found v eggs

From the problem, we know the following relationships:

1. Lamar found 5 fewer eggs than Stacy: z = y + 5
2. Stacy found twice as many eggs as Lamar: z = 2y
3. Charlie found 2 fewer eggs than Stacy: w = z - 2
4. Mei found half as many eggs as Charlie: v = w/2
5. The total number of eggs found is equal to the number of eggs hidden: x = y + z + w + v

Now, let's solve this equation to find the number of eggs hidden:

1. First, let's express z and w in terms of y:
   z = 2y
   w = 2y - 2

2. Next, let's substitute y, z, w, v into the original equation:
   x = y + z + w + v
   x = y + 2y + 2y - 2 + (2y)/2

3. Simplify and combine the terms:
   x = 5y + 1

4. Since Cole hid a multiple of a dozen eggs, x must be a multiple of 12. Also, x is the sum of a finite set of positive integers. Because of this, x can only take certain values that meet these conditions. For example, there is no solution to this problem if x = 7 or x = 11.

5. If we test small enough multiples of 12 as possible values of x, we can find the solution. When x = 12, it works:
   12 = 1 + 2(5) + 2(5) - 2 + (2)(2)(5)/2

6. Finally, check that the number of eggs found is equal to the original number of eggs hidden:
   x = 12
   y = 5
   z = 10
   w = 8
   v = 4
   5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 22 ≠ 12

From this, it seems that the problem is inconsistent or contains a mistake. {The final answer is not possible, given the information provided in the problem.}</s>","Cole hides 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 eggs.
Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Mei finds 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 eggs.
The children find a total of 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = <<5+10+8+4=27>>27 eggs.

- There are 200 apartments in each of the first two complexes.
- The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined.
- 60% of (2 * 200) = 60% of 400 = 0.6 * 400 = 240 apartments.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments that John collects garbage from.
- Total number of apartments = 200 (complex 1) + 200 (complex 2) + 240 (complex 3) = 640.

Step 3: Calculate the money John makes per week from one apartment.
- He gets paid $.40 per collection per apartment.

Step 4: Calculate the money John makes per week for each complex.
- Money per week per complex = Number of apartments in complex × Money per collection per apartment × Collections per week
- Money per week per complex = 200 (apartments in complex 1, 2, and 3) × $.40 (amount per collection) × 3 (collections per week) = 1200 × $.40 × 3 = $1440.

Step 5: Calculate the total money John makes per week.

                 [/INST] To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree produces during its first 10 years of life, we need to calculate the fruit production for each year and then sum up the production for all those years. From the given information, we have:

- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 * 50 = <<3*50=150>>150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 * 50 = <<7*50=350>>350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 less than a 10-year-old tree's fruit production.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 * 50 = <<20*50=1000>>1000 fruits.
- During the ninth year, a tree doesn't produce any fruits.

First, let's find out how many fruits an 8-year-old tree produces:
An 8-year-old tree produces <<7*50=350>>350 fruits.
Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits and an 8-year-old tree produces 350 fruits, an 8-year-old tree produces 200 less fruits than a 10-year-old tree. So, the number of fruits an 8-year-old tree produces is 1000 - 200 = <<1000-200=800>>800 fruits.

Now, let's calculate the total fruit production during the first 10 years:
Total fruit production = Fruits at age 5 + Fruits at age 6 + Fruits at age 7 + Fruits at age 8 + Fruits at age 9 + Fruits at age 10
Total fruit production = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
Total fruit production = 1950

{The final answer is 1950 fruits}</s>","At 5 years it produces 50 fruits
At 6 years it produces 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 fruits.
At 7 years, it produces 50 * 7 = <<50*7=350>>350 fruits
At 10 years, it produces 50 * 20 = <<50*20=1000>>1000 fruits
At 8 years, it produces 200 fewer fruits than at 10 years, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits
During 10 years, an avocado tree can produce a total of 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = <<50+150+350+800+1000=2350>>2350 fruits

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: red = 4x
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: x < y
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: x + y + red = 37

Now, let's find the length of the red rope using these clues:

Step 1: Solve for y (length of the yellow rope) using the information given in step 1 and 3.
We already know that red = 4x, and we're given that x + y + red = 37. Substituting red with 4x, we get: x + y + 4x = 37
Simplifying: 5x + y = 37

Step 2: Find the length of the yellow rope in terms of x.
Subtracting x from both sides of the equation x + y = 37: y = 37 - x

Step 3: Find the length of the red rope using the length of the blue rope (x) and the relationship between the red and blue ropes (red = 4x).
The length of the red rope is given as red = 4x

So, {The final answer is 4x, or 4 times the length of the blue rope.}</s>","Let Y = the length of the yellow rope in centimeters

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given three times as much money as Ronnie. So, Rissa was given $5 * 3 = $15.
3. They both gave equal amounts to their little sister. Let x be the amount each gave to their little sister.

Now, we know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. So, the amount left with Rissa is $15 - x.

We're also given information that the amount Rissa has left is 4/5 of her original amount. So, we can write the equation: $15-x = (3/5)*$15

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$15-x = \frac{3}{5}*\$15
$15-x = \$9

Now, we need to find the difference between the initial amount and the amount that was given away to the sister.
$9 = $15 - x
x = $15 - $9
x = $6

So, each sister initially had $1 more than what they gave to their little sister ($5 + $1 = $6 for Ronnie and $15 + $1 = $16 for Rissa).

Therefore, Ronnie started with $5 + $1 = $6, and now he has $6 - $x = $6 - ($6) = $0 (Since he gave all his money away).

1. We know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural. Let's call the amount of each color ""x"".
2. Half of the mural is yellow, so the other half is red, white, and purple. The total amount of paint in the mural is 12 pints.
3. Half of the mural is yellow, so the other half is red, white, and purple. The amount of yellow paint is 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.
4. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and there are three colors besides yellow, the amount of each of those colors is x.
5. We know that x (red, white, or purple) + 6 (yellow) = 12 (total paint).
6. Let's first find the total amount of non-yellow paint. x + x + x = 12 - 6 = 6.

The dimensions of one bedroom are given as 20 feet by 12 feet. To find the area of one bedroom, multiply its length and width:
Area of one bedroom = 20 ft × 12 ft = 240 sq ft

Step 2: Find the area of the living room.
The living room is stated to be 5 times bigger than one bedroom. So, the area of the living room is 5 × Area of one bedroom:
Area of living room = 5 × 240 sq ft = 1200 sq ft

Step 3: Find the area of the rest of the house.
The rest of the house has an area of 1000 sq ft.

Step 4: Find the total area of the house.
To find the total area of the house, add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
Total area = Area of bedrooms + Area of living room + Area of other spaces
Total area = (Number of bedrooms × Area of one bedroom) + Area of living room + Area of other spaces
Total area = (4 × 240 sq ft) + 1200 sq ft + Area of other spaces

                    question:
                    ? A regular box of 100 ! dishwasher pods costs $12. There's , currently a , special size , box : for the ? same price that , has ! 20% more pods. ! How many dishwashing cycles , with . the new box can : you run for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle?
                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many dishwasher cycles can be run with the regular box of 100 pods at a price of $1 per pod.

Cost of a single pod = $1
Number of pods in a regular box = 100

Number of cycles with a regular box = Total number of pods / Number of pods per cycle
= 100 / 1
= 100 cycles

The question states that the special size box costs the same as the regular box, so we can determine the number of cycles with the special size box by finding out how many pods it has and dividing that number by the number of pods per cycle.

Cost of special size box = $12 (Same as regular box)

We're told that the special box has 20% more pods than a regular box, so let's calculate the number of pods in the special box:

Pods in a special box = Pods in a regular box + (20% of Pods in a regular box)
= 100 + (0.2 * 100)
= 100 + 20
= 120 pods

Number of cycles with the special size box = Total number of pods / Number of pods per cycle
= 120 / 1
= 120 cycles

Now we can answer the question: To run 1 cycle at a cost of $1 using the special size box, we can use one of the 120 pods, so the number of cycles we can run for $1 with the special size box is:

Number of cycles for $1 with special size box = 120 / 1
= 120

So, the special size box can be used to run 120 cycles with a cost of $1 per cycle.

{The final answer is: The special size box can be used to run 120 cycles at a cost of $1 per cycle.}</s>","If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods
If the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods
If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10
If 1 cycle costs $0.10, then for $1 I could run $1/$0.1 = 10 cycles

                 [/INST] Step 1: Thomas withdraws $1000 from the bank. Since $1 equals 5 $20 bills, Thomas receives $1000 / $20 = 50 stacks of $20 bills, or a total of 50 x 20 = 1000 $20 bills.

Step 2: Thomas loses 10 bills. So, he now has 1000 - 10 x 20 = 990 $20 bills.

Step 3: Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, he uses 990 / 2 = 495 sets of $20 bills, or a total of 495 x 20 = 9900 $20. We're told to assume that the bill is exactly 9900 $, so Thomas paid the bill and has no money left.

Step 4: Thomas triples his money. Since Thomas had 990 $20 bills before paying the bill, he now has 3 x 990 = 2970 $20 bills.

Step 5: Thomas converts all his bills to $5 bills. Since $1 equals 5 $20 bills, Thomas converts 2970 $20 bills into 2970 x 5 = 14850 $5 bills.

Step 2: In the second half, team A scores 1/4 * (number of goals team B scored in the second half). Since team B scored 4 times the number of goals in the first half, team B scored 4X goals in the second half.

Step 3: Therefore, 1/4 * (4X) = X goals for team A in the second half.

Step 4: To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to find the total number of goals scored by both teams in both halves:

Total goals for Team A = X (first half) + X (second half) = 2X
Total goals for Team B = X (first half) + 4X (second half) = 5X

Step 5: The final answer is the sum of the total goals scored by both teams:
Total goals = 2X (Team A) + 5X (Team B) = (2+5)X = 7X = 7 * (number of goals scored by Team A in the first half). Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 7 times the number of goals scored by Team A in the first half. {The final answer is 7 * (number of goals scored by Team A in the first half)}.

So the total number of goals scored in the match is 7 times the number of goals scored by team A in the first half.</s>","In the first half, team B scores 4 goals - 2 goals = <<4-2=2>>2 goals.

                 [/INST] Let's call the length of the new piece of chalk ""x"" (in inches). We know that on Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, so the amount of chalk used was 0.45x.Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. Therefore, the length of the chalk left after Monday is x - 0.45x = 0.55x.

Now, we know that the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day for writing equations. So, the amount of chalk used each day is 0.20x.

To find the number of days before the teacher has to recycle the piece of chalk, we divide the amount of chalk left with the amount used each day:

Number of days = (Length of chalk left) / (Amount of chalk used each day)

Substituting the values we have:

Number of days = (0.55x) / (0.20x)

Simplifying the above expression:

Number of days = 2.75x / 0.20x

Number of days = 13.75

As the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number:

Number of days = 13

So, the teacher has used up about 45% of a 5-inch piece of chalk on Monday, and he will have to recycle the piece after using it for 13 more days.

                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many teeth the dentist fixes in total. We know he drills and fills 4 teeth, and he also caps 7 teeth. So the total number of teeth the dentist fixes is: 4 (drilled) + 7 (caps) = <<4+7=11>>11 teeth.

Now let's find out the total number of teeth James has. We started by saying James has 30 teeth. {The final answer is, the dentist fixes a percentage of 37.33% of James' teeth: (11/30)*100% = 37.33%}

However, the question asked for the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist ""fixes."" They didn't specifically ask for the percentage of teeth that are drilled and capped combined.

Let's try another approach and calculate the percentage of teeth that are drilled and capped respectively.

We know there are 30 teeth in total, and 4 teeth are drilled. So, the percentage of teeth that are drilled is: (4/30)*100% = <<4/30*100=13.33>>13.33%. Now let's find out how many teeth are capped. We were told there are 7 more teeth than those drilled, so there are 7 + 4 = <<7+4=11>>11 teeth that are capped. So, the percentage of teeth that are capped is: (11/30)*100% = <<11/30*100=36.67>>36.67%.

So, the dentist ""fixes"" a percentage of 13.33% + 36.67% = <<13.33+36.67=49.99>>49.99% of James' teeth. But since the percentage can't be more than 100%, the correct answer should be either 13.33% or 36.67%, depending on whether we include only the drilled teeth or the drilled and capped teeth. However, in the previous response I got 37.33%, which is a mistake from my part. I apologize for that error. {The final answer is, the dentist fixes a percentage of 13.33% or 36.67% of James' teeth, depending on the definition of ""fixes"".}</s>","First find the total number of teeth the dentist caps: 4 teeth + 7 teeth = <<4+7=11>>11 teeth

Then divide that number by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of teeth he fixes: 15 teeth / 30 teeth * 100% = 50%

Total amount paid = Gallons of milk purchased * Cost per gallon
Total amount paid = 4000 gallons * $3.5/gallon
Total amount paid = $14,000

Step 2: Calculate the amount of milk that went bad and was returned.
Amount of milk that went bad = Total gallons purchased * Percentage that went bad
Amount of milk that went bad = 4000 gallons * 20%
Amount of milk that went bad = 800 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the refund amount given that the company did not specify a refund percentage. To do this, we will assume a refund percentage of 50% (as a common practice). But without specific information, we cannot be certain of the refund amount.

Refund amount = Amount of milk that went bad * Refund percentage
Refund amount = 800 gallons * 50%

                 [/INST] Let's denote the current age of Colin as C, and the current age of Wendy as W. According to the problem, we have:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now, so:
   W = 5 * (C + 7)

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. We can write this as:
   C + 25 = (1/3) * W

Now, we have two equations with two variables. We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination method. Here, we'll use the substitution method.

First, let's solve for C in the second equation:

C = (1/3) * W - 25

Next, we'll substitute this expression for C into the first equation:

W = 5 * (C + 7)
W = 5 * ([1/3] * W + 7)
W = 5 * (1/3 * W + 7)
W = 5 * (1/3 * W + 2(1/3) * W + 5)
15 * W = 5W + 15W + 35
16 * W = 20W + 35
W(16-20) = 35
W = 35/(-4) = -8.75 (This answer doesn't make sense in the given context, as ages should be positive numbers. We possibly made an error in our calculations. Let's double-check the equations.)

We made an error in our calculations. Let's fix it. We'll use the elimination method instead.

First, let's eliminate W from the two equations:

W = 5 * (C + 7)
C + 25 = (1/3) * W

Subtract C + 7 from the first equation:

4W = 5*(C + 7)

Now, use the given relationship from the second equation to replace W:

C + 25 = (1/3) * W
C + 25 = (1/3) * [5 * (C + 7)]

To find the value of C, we need to solve this equation. Let's first find a common denominator for 1 and 5. Since 15 is a common multiple of both, let's multiply both sides of the equation by 15 to get:

15*(C+25) = 5*(3*C+35)

Now, distribute the 5 on the right side:

15C + 15*25 = 5*3C + 5*35

Next, distribute the 3 on the left side:

15C + 375 = 15C + 175C

Combine like terms on the left side:

15C + 375 = 190C

Subtract 15C from both sides to isolate C:

375 = 175C

To find the value of C, divide by 175:

C = 375 / 175
C = 2 (approximately)

So, Colin's age is approximately 2 years old now. {The final answer is 2.}</s>","Let x be Colin's age now.

                 [/INST] To find out how many books Bob can buy for each school, we first need to find out how many books he can buy in total with his budget of $27,000.

1. Calculate the number of books Bob can buy with $500: Bob can buy 100 books for $500, so the cost of one book is $5 per book (500 dollars divided by 100 books).

2. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy: With a budget of $27,000, Bob can buy 27,000 dollars worth of books, which is 27,000 books divided by $5 per book.

3. Find out how many books Bob can buy for each school: Since Bob is distributing the books between 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy for each school.

Therefore, the final answer is {Bob can buy 9,000 books in total and can buy approximately 3,000 books for each school}.

Note that the approximate value of 3,000 books for each school is calculated by dividing the total number of books (9,000) by the number of schools (3). The exact number of books Bob can buy for each school may vary slightly depending on the exact number of books he can buy with $500.</s>","He spends 27000/3=$<<27000/3=9000>>9000

We know that each bag contains 50 kg of coal and Ali ordered 850 kg of coal. So, we need to find out how many bags are needed to hold that amount.

850 kg (coal ordered by Ali) / 50 kg (coal in one bag) = 17 bags

So, Ali ordered 17 bags of coal.

Step 2: Find the total cost of Ali's order.
We know that each bag costs $18. Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag

Step 1: Find the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends.
- Cheese pizza slices per friend = 6
- Number of friends = 6
- Total number of cheese pizza slices = Friends × Cheese slices per friend
          = 6 × 6
          = 36

Step 2: Find the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends.
- Pepperoni pizza slices per friend = 4
- Number of friends = 6
- Total number of pepperoni pizza slices = Friends × Pepperoni slices per friend
          = 6 × 4
          = 24

Step 3: Find the total number of slices from both types of pizzas that Kate's friends will eat.
Total number of slices = Total number of cheese pizza slices + Total number of pepperoni pizza slices
                  = 36 + 24
                  = 60

Step 4: Determine how many cheese pizza slices or pepperoni pizza slices come from one pizza pie.
- Cheese pizza slices per pie = 12
- Pepperoni pizza slices per pie = 8

Step 5: Find the number of cheese pizza pies and pepperoni pizza pies that Kate needs to buy to provide enough slices for her friends.
- Total number of pizza slices = Total number of slices for Kate's friends
- Total number of pizza slices = 60
- Number of cheese pizza slices per pie = 12
- Number of pepperoni pizza slices per pie = 8
- We will find out the minimum number of pies needed by assuming that she buys only cheese pizza pies.
- Minimum number of cheese pizza pies = Total number of pizza slices / Number of cheese pizza slices per pie
          = 60 / 12
          = 5
- Now, let's find how many pepperoni pizza slices are in 5 cheese pizza pies.
  - Total number of pepperoni pizza slices in 5 cheese pizza pies = 5 × Number of pepperoni pizza slices per pie
          = 5 × 8
          = 40
- The total number of slices from the 5 cheese pizza pies is 5 × 12 = 60
- Since her friends consumed a total of 60 slices, Kate needs to buy only 5 cheese pizza pies to satisfy her friends' demand.

                    Jay , is ? making snowballs to prepare for a snowball fight , with his sister. : He can ; build . 20 snowballs in an . hour, . but ! 2 melt every 15 minutes. How long ; will it take before he has 60 : snowballs?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.
2. Two snowballs melt every 15 minutes.

First, let's find out how many snowballs Jay loses to melting per hour. Since two snowballs melt every 15 minutes, that's the equivalent of one hour:

2 snowballs * (2 hours / 15 minutes) = 4 snowballs per hour

Now, let's find out how long it takes Jay to build 40 snowballs (since he starts with 20 and loses 4 to melting every hour):

It takes him 1 hour to build 20 snowballs, so it takes him an additional hour to build 20 more:

Total time to build 40 snowballs = 1 hour * 2 = 2 hours

However, since he loses 4 snowballs per hour to melting, it will actually take him longer to have 60 snowballs:

Let x be the number of hours it takes Jay to build and maintain 60 snowballs, then:

20 (hours to build 20 snowballs) + x (hours to build additional snowballs) = 60 (desired number of snowballs)

Subtracting the initial 20 snowballs, we have:

x = 40 + (60 - 20)

x = 40 + 40

x = 80 hours

However, this answer is not feasible because it would take longer than 80 hours for Jay to build and maintain 60 snowballs. Let's try a different approach.

Let y be the number of hours it takes for Jay to build enough snowballs that, over the course of y hours, he builds y*20 snowballs but loses y*4 snowballs to melting, resulting in a net gain of y*(20-4) = y*16 snowballs.

We know that:

20*hours to build 20 snowballs + hours to build additional snowballs = hours to build y*20 snowballs

Solving for hours to build additional snowballs, we get:

hours to build additional snowballs = (hours to build y*20 snowballs - 20*hours to build 20 snowballs) / y

Plugging in y = 3, we get:

hours to build additional snowballs = (hours to build 60 snowballs - 20) / 3

We know that 20 snowballs take 1 hour to build, so the total time to build 60 snowballs is:

Total hours to build 60 snowballs = 1 hour * 20 (for the initial 20 snowballs) + hours to build additional snowballs

We can set up the equation as:

1 hour * 20 + (hours to build additional snowballs) = (1 hour * 20 * 3) / (y) + 1 hour * 20

Substituting y = 3 and solving for hours to build additional snowballs, we get:

hours to build additional snowballs ≈ 0.84 hours

So, adding to the initial hour it takes to build 20 snowballs, the total time it takes Jay to build and maintain 60 snowballs is approximately:

Total time = 1 hour + 0.84 hours ≈ 1.84 hours.

Therefore, {The final answer is approximately 1 hour and 50 minutes (or 1.84 hours) for Jay to build and maintain 60 snowballs}.</s>","Every hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs.
At the same time, each hour 2 * 60/15 = <<2*60/15=8>>8 snowballs melt.
This means that each hour, Jay ends up with 20 – 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 more snowballs.
It will take Jay 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 hours to create enough snowballs.

                    , Digimon had : its 20th ; anniversary.  When it came , out John ? was twice ? as ? old as Jim.  If John is 28 now ? how old is Jim?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the variables and given information.

Let's denote:
- The current year as C
- The number of years Digimon has been around as D
- John's age now as J_now
- Jim's age now as I_now
- Jim's age when Digimon came out as I_digi

Given information:
- Digimon had its 20th anniversary, so D = 20
- When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim, so I_digi = 0.5 * J_digi

Step 2: Find Jim's age when Digimon came out (I_digi).

Since I_digi = 0.5 * J_digi and Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can set up the equation: 20 = D + (J_now - I_digi). Here, D is already given as 20, so we have:

J_now - I_digi = 20

Now, we can use the information that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. So we have:

I_digi = 0.5 * J_digi

Substituting I_digi in the first equation, we get:

J_now - (0.5 * J_digi) = 20

Step 3: Solve for J_digi.

First, let's solve this quadratic equation for J_digi:

J_digi = (2 * J_now) / (1 - 0.5)
J_digi = 2 * J_now / 0.5
J_digi = 4 * J_now

Now, we have J_digi = 4 * J_now and the equation J_now - I_digi = 20. We can substitute J_digi in the first equation:

J_now - (0.5 * (4 * J_now)) = 20

Solving this equation, we get:

J_now - 2 * J_now = 20
- J_now = 20
J_now = -20

Since age can't be negative, we made an error somewhere. Let's check our steps.

Step 4: Revisit our calculations.

Notice that our initial assumption of Subtracting I_digi from J_now led us to a wrong sign. The correct approach should be Adding I_digi to J_now and then subtracting 20.

Step 5: Find Jim's age now (I_now).

With the corrected approach, we have:

J_now + I_digi = 20 + J_digi
J_now + (0.5 * J_digi) = 20

Solving for J_digi:

J_digi = 40 - J_now

Now, we know that Jim's age when Digimon came out was half of John's age, so:

J_digi = 4 * J_now

Setting up both equations, we have:

4 * J_now = 40 - J_now

Solving for J_now:

2 * J_now = 39
J_now = 19.5

Since age is a whole number, we rounded down to 19.

Step 6: Find Jim's age now (I_now).

Using the information that I_now = J_now - (D - I_digi), where D is the number of years Digimon had been around (D = 20) and I_digi was found earlier (I_digi = 19):

I_now = J_now - (20 - 19)
I_now = J_now - 1

Since J_now is 19, we have:

I_now = Jim's age = J_now - 1 = 18.

{The final answer is Jim is 18 years old.}</s>","When Digimon came out John would have been 28-20=<<28-20=8>>8

2. The cost for coloring her hair is $40.
3. The cost for getting her hair cut is $30 per inch.
4. Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the difference in length is 2 inches.

To find the cost of getting her hair cut, we can multiply the number of inches that were cut by the cost per inch:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate Jen's weekly earnings without the weekly bonus.
Jen works 7.5 hours a day, so her weekly hours are:
Weekly hours = Hours per day * Days per week
Weekly hours = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week
Weekly hours = 45 hours/week

Now, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings at her hourly rate of $1.5:
Weekly earnings = Hourly rate * Weekly hours
Weekly earnings = $1.5/hour * 45 hours/week
Weekly earnings = $67.50/week

Step 2: Calculate Jen's total earnings in a month with complete attendance.
There are 4 weeks in a month, so her monthly earnings without the weekly bonus are:
Monthly earnings = Weekly earnings * Number of weeks
Monthly earnings = $67.50/week * 4 weeks
Monthly earnings = $270/month

Now, let's add the weekly bonus of $10 to her monthly earnings:
Total earnings = Monthly earnings + Weekly bonus * Number of weeks
Total earnings = $270/month + $10/week * 4 weeks
Total earnings = $270/month + $40
Total earnings = $310/month

So, the final answer is: {Jen will receive $310 in a month if she has complete attendance}.</s>","In a week, Jen works for 7.5 hours/day x 6 days = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours/week
So in a month, she works for 45 hours/week x 4 weeks = <<45*4=180>>180 hours.
180 hours of work is equal to 180 hours x $1.5 = $<<180*1.5=270>>270.
Since she has complete attendance, she will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the amount of money Jason earned for each task in a two-week period. As stated in the question, Jason earned $3.00 for doing his laundry once, $1.50 for cleaning his room once, $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb twice, and $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher six times.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Jason earned for doing his laundry, taking out the trash, and cleaning his room in a two-week period.
- For laundry: $3.00 (once every two weeks) * 1 (in the given period) = $3.00
- For cleaning his room: $1.50 (once every two weeks) * 1 (in the given period) = $1.50
- For taking out the trash: $0.75 (twice in a two-week period) * 2 (in the given period) = $1.50
Total earnings for these tasks = $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $6.00

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Jason earned for emptying the dishwasher in a two-week period. Since he emptied it 6 times during the given period, and he earned $0.50 per emptying, his total earnings for dishwasher emptying are: $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Step 4: Add the earnings from all tasks to find the total amount of money Jason earned.
Total earnings = $6.00 (from laundry, cleaning room, and taking out the trash) + $3.00 (from dishwasher emptying) = $9.00

{The final answer is $9.00}</s>","Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times at $0.50 each so he made 6*.50=$<<6*.50=3.00>>3.00
Jason did his laundry 1 time at $3.00 so he made 1*3 = $<<1*3=3.00>>3.00
Jason took the trash out 2 times at $0.75 each so he made 2*.75 = $<<2*.75=1.50>>1.50
Jason cleaned his room 1 time at $1.50 each so he made 1*1.50 = $<<1*1.50=1.50>>1.50

1. At 9:00 am, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At 10:00 am, 40 more people entered and ordered food.So, 50 (first group) + 40 (second group) = 90 people
3. At some point after the first two groups arrived, twice the number of people who came in at 10:00 am returned for lunch. Let's assume that initially, 50 people came for breakfast, so 2 * 50 = 100 people came for lunch.
4. By evening, 3 times the number of initial visitors had entered the restaurant. So, 50 (first group) + 100 (lunch group) + 3 * 50 = 200 people

Therefore, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 90 (first and second groups) + 100 (lunch group) = 190 people.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the cost of one bottle of scotch as S. We know that John buys 10 bottles of scotch, so the cost of the scotch is 10S.

Step 2: The total cost of the scotch is $600, so we have the equation: 10S = $600. To find S, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10: S = $60.

Step 3: John also buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. He buys 10 bottles of scotch, so he buys 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 bottles of cognac.

Step 4: We know that each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch, so the cost of one bottle of cognac is S + 0.5S = 1.5S.

Step 5: John spends the total cost of the cognac on everything, so we have the equation: 20 * 1.5S = total cost. To find the total cost, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 1: 20 * 1.5S = total cost => total cost = 20 * 1.5S

Therefore, the final answer is: {The total cost of John's purchase is $3000}.</s>","The scotch cost $600/10=$<<600/10=60>>60 each
He bought 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 bottles of cognac

- Half of these trees were White Oak, so there are 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 White Oak trees.
- The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted is twice the number of White Oak trees, so there are 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 Lodgepole Pine trees.
- The total number of trees planted on the first day is 10 (White Oak) + 20 (Lodgepole Pine) = <<10+20=30>>30 trees.

Step 2: Determine the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day.
- Twenty more White Oak trees were planted on the second day, so there are 10 (first day) + 20 (second day) = <<10+20=30>>30 White Oak trees in total.

                 [/INST] To find out how much root beer was available for the party guests, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer Fred had prepared and then subtract the amounts that were lost or consumed before the party. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. On the first day, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. He put all of it in the refrigerator cooler.
2. On the first day, Fred's children consumed 4 gallons of root beer.
3. On the second day, Barbie spilled 7 gallons of root beer.
4. On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie consumed 5 gallons of root beer.
5. In total, Fred had made 24 gallons of root beer, but due to the losses and consumption before the party, only the remaining gallons were left for the guests.
6. The losses were as follows: His children consumed 4 gallons, Barbie spilled 7 gallons, and Ronnie consumed 5 gallons.
7. Therefore, the total loss was 4 + 7 + 5 = <ins>16 gallons</ins>.
8. Since Fred had made 24 gallons initially and there was a loss of 16 gallons, the remaining amount was 24 - 16 = <ins>8 gallons</ins>.
9. If 3 people showed up for the party, and they were to share the remaining root beer equally, each person would get 8 gallons / 3 people = <ins>2.67 gallons (approximately)</ins>.
10. However, it's not practical to serve such a small amount to each guest. To account for this unreasonably small serving size, we can consider that Fred possibly had more root beer prepared that was not in the cooler, or the guests could have brought additional beverages, so they could all have had a normal serving size at the party.

Therefore, the final answer to this problem depends on external factors not provided in the given context - it is impossible to determine exactly how much root beer was available for each guest to drink during the party based on the information provided. {The final answer is unknown.}</s>","Fred started with 24 gallons, but on day 1, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24-4=<<24-4=20>>20 gallons of root beer.
On day two, Barbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20-7=<<20-7=13>>13 gallons of root beer.
On day three, Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons, leaving 13-5=<<13-5=8>>8 gallons of root beer for the party.
Three guests joined Fred for the party, resulting in 3+1=<<3+1=4>>4 party goers.
If the 4 party-goers split the root beer equally, each person gets 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 gallons

                 [/INST] To find the number of fish with red and blue stripes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the number of fish with red stripes. One-third of 66 fish have red stripes:
   Red striped fish = (1/3) * Total number of fish
   Red striped fish = (1/3) * 66
   Red striped fish = 22

2. Find the number of remaining fish without red stripes:
   Remaining fish = Total number of fish - Red striped fish
   Remaining fish = 66 - 22
   Remaining fish = 44

3. Find the number of fish with blue stripes. Five-elevenths of the remaining fish have blue stripes:
   Blue striped fish = (5/11) * Remaining fish
   Blue striped fish = (5/11) * 44
   Blue striped fish = (22/2) * (22/11) * 44
   Blue striped fish = 22 * (22/11) * 44/22
   Blue striped fish = 22 * 2 * 2 * 2 * (44/11)
   Blue striped fish = 22 * 2 * 2 * 2 * (4 * 11/1)
   Blue striped fish = 22 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 44
   Blue striped fish = 22 * 168
   Blue striped fish = 3696

So, the final answer is: {The final answer is 3698 fish have red stripes and 3696 fish have blue stripes (a total of 7394 fish in the fish tank).

Step 4: She used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which is 6 colors. So she had 18 - 6 = <<18-6=12>>12 colors left from the makeup sets.

Step 5: In total, Amy had 4 colors from the palettes and 12 colors from the makeup sets. So she had 4 + 12 = <<4+12=16>>16 colors left.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Mattison is 60 inches tall.

Step 2: The two-story house that Mattison lives in is 7 times as tall as he is. So, the height of the house is: 60 inches (Mattison's height) × 7 = 420 inches

Step 3: The height of the first floor in the house is three times as tall as Mattison is. So, the height of the first floor is: 60 inches (Mattison's height) × 3 = 180 inches

Step 4: To find the height of the roof from the second floor, we need to find the height of the second floor first. Since the house is two stories tall, the height of the second floor is the difference between the total height of the house and the height of the first floor: 420 inches (total height) - 180 inches (first floor height) = 240 inches

Step 5: Since the roof is on the second floor, its height is the difference between the height of the second floor and the height of the ceilings on the second floor. We don't have explicit information about the height of the ceilings on the second floor, but we know that they are higher than the first floor ceilings, which are three times Mattison's height. Therefore, the height of the roof can be estimated as: 240 inches (second floor height) - x inches (second floor ceiling height) > 180 inches (first floor ceiling height), where x > 180

For example, if the second floor ceiling height was exactly four times Mattison's height (x = 60 × 4 = 240), the roof height would be zero inches; this is clearly an error, so we need to increase the ceiling height to get a positive height for the roof.

{The final answer is: The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is greater than 0 inches but an exact value cannot be determined with the given information.}</s>","Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.
Hence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. The total number of shells discovered by the three teams is 700.
2. Team Alphas found 40% of the shells, so they found: 700 * 0.4 = 280 shells
3. Team The Finders found 60% of the remaining shells, Let's denote the total number of shells as S. since team Alphas found 280 shells, so we have 
S = 700 
280 = 40% * S
S = 700 / 0.4 = 1750
Then Team The Finders found: 1750 * 0.6 = 1050 shells
4. Now, we need to find out how many shells Team Gogetters found. We know that Team Alphas and Team The Finders have found 280 + 1050 = 1330 shells in total. 
So, the number of shells Team Gogetters found is: 700 - (280 + 1050) = -330, this result is meaningless, because number of shells cannot be negative.
It seems that there is some mistake in problem statement, the number of shells stated should be greater than 700 for the given distribution of shells among teams.

Therefore, The final answer cannot be provided as the problem statement is incorrect.</s>","Team Alphas found 40/100*700 = <<40/100*700=280>>280 shells.
If team Alphas found 280 shells, the other teams found 700-280 = 420 shells.
Team The Finders found 60% of the remaining shells, a total of 60/100*420 = <<60/100*420=252>>252 shells.
If The finders found 252 shells, team Gogetters found 420-252 = 168 shells.

1. First, let's find the daily mileage for each dog:
   - Dog 1: 1 mile
   - Dog 2: 4 miles
   - Dog 3: 3 miles

2. Next, we find the total daily mileage for all dogs combined:
   1 mile (dog 1) + 4 miles (dog 2) + 3 miles (dog 3) = 8 miles

3. The problem states that ""On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day."" This is a bit confusing since the total mileage above was 8 miles, not 3 miles. Let's clear up this discrepancy. If the average is 3 miles per day for 4 dogs, then the total daily miles for 4 dogs is 12 miles (4 dogs * 3 miles/dog).

4. Since we already determined that the total daily miles for 3 dogs was 8 miles, the fourth dog (the one we're trying to find the mileage for) must walk an additional 4 miles to make up the difference (12 miles - 8 miles).

The final answer is: The last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.</s>","The total walk distance must be 12 miles because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12

2. He gets a loan worth 40% of that. So, the loan amount is $250,000 × 0.4 = $100,000
3. He uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts, so $100,000 × 0.6 = $60,000 is used for that.
4. Since we've determined how much of the loan was used for debts ($60,000), we can find the amount of money left over by subtracting that from the original loan amount ($100,000): $100,000 - $60,000

So, the final answer is: John had $40,000 leftover after paying his debts.</s>","His loan is worth 250,000*.4=$<<250000*.4=100000>>100,000

1. Calculate the total weight of the tunas: The total weight is the sum of the weights of all three tunas.
   Total weight = weight of first tuna + weight of second tuna + weight of third tuna
   Total weight = 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg
   Total weight = 128 kg

2. Calculate the total earnings: The total earnings are the total weight of the tunas multiplied by the price per kilogram.
   Total earnings = total weight * price per kilogram
   Total earnings = 128 kg * $0.50/kg
   Total earnings = $64

{The final answer is $64}. Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.</s>","Deandre will earn 56 x $0.50 = $<<56*0.5=28>>28 from the first tuna.

And he will earn 26 x $0.50 = $<<26*0.5=13>>13 from the third tuna.

                 [/INST] To find Trinity's profit, we first need to determine the price at which she sells each magazine, and then calculate the difference between the selling price and the cost price.

We're given that Trinity sells magazines at 11/8 of the cost price. Let's call the cost price ""x"".

Then, the selling price is: Selling price = Cost price * (11/8)

Since we're given that the cost price is $72, let's substitute x with $72:

Selling price = $72 * (11/8)

Now let's find the profit: Profit = Selling price - Cost price

Profit = $72 * (11/8) - $72

Profit = $72 * (11/8) - $72

To solve this equation, we can't simply subtract the cost price from the selling price because they are not in the same units. Instead, we should find the common denominator for both expressions.

The least common multiple of 8 and 11 is 88. In other words, there exist integers m and n such that 11m = 8n. We can use this information to rewrite the expression (11/8).

Multiply both sides of the equation by 8 to eliminate the denominator: 11m = 8n * 8

Now we find that 11m = 64n. By taking the square root of both sides we obtain m = 8n. Now we substitute this in the profit expression.

Profit = $72 * (8n/8) - $72

Profit = $72n - $72

Since we don't have a value for n, we cannot calculate the exact profit.

{The final answer is: We cannot calculate the exact profit from the given information.}</s>","Trinity sells magazines at 11/8*$72=$<<11/8*72=99>>99.

The true number of red jelly beans in the . container ! is . 900.  ; How far off ! was his guess?
                 [/INST] To find out how far off Tim was with his guess, we first need to find out how many jelly beans are actually in the jar.

First, let's calculate the volume of the jar:
Volume of the jar = length ^3
Volume of the jar = 6 inches ^2 (square base) * 15 inches (height)

Volume of the jar = 324 cubic inches (6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches)

Next, let's calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar based on the given information:
Total number of jelly beans = Volume of the jar / Volume of 1 jelly bean
Total number of jelly beans = 324 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches

Total number of jelly beans = 2160 (rounded)

Now, let's calculate the number of red jelly beans based on the given efficiency and percentage of red jelly beans:
Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * Percentage of red jelly beans * Efficiency
Number of red jelly beans = 2160 * 0.3 * 0.8

Number of red jelly beans = 596.8 (rounded)

Since there are no such things as partial jelly beans, Tim's estimate of having 30% red jelly beans would result in approximately 597 red jelly beans if they could all be accounted for. While the true number of red jelly beans is 900.

The difference between Tim's guess and the true number of red jelly beans is:
Difference = |True number of red jelly beans - Tim's guess|
Difference = |900 - 597|

Difference = 303

{The final answer is: Tim was 303 red jelly beans off from his guess.}</s>","The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches
That means it can fit 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans
With 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there
So that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red
So his guess is off by 900-864=<<900-864=36>>36

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of people on the bus after the first and second stops.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, so there are now 20 (initial passengers) + 40 (new passengers) = <<20+40=60>>60 people on the bus.

On the second stop, 3/4 of the passengers from the first stop entered the bus. So, the number of passengers who entered the bus on the second stop is 60 (total passengers on the bus after the first stop) * 3/4 = <<60*3/4=45>>45 people.

Step 2: Determine the total number of passengers on the bus after the second stop.

After the second stop, there are 60 (initial passengers) + 40 (passengers who entered at the first stop) + 45 (passengers who entered at the second stop) = <<60+40+45=145>>145 passengers on the bus.

Step 3: Determine the number of remaining spaces on the bus.

The capacity of the bus is 200 people, so there are 200 (total capacity) - 145 (current number of passengers) = <<200-145=55>>55 remaining spaces on the bus.

Step 4: Determine the number of passengers required to fill the remaining spaces.

Since the number of passengers required to fill the remaining spaces doubled at the third station, there must be 55 passengers * 2 = <<55*2=110>>110 passengers on the bus after the third station.

Therefore, {The final answer is 110 people} are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.</s>","If the number of passengers increased by 3/4 times the number that entered the bus on the first station, 3/4 * 40 people = <<3/4*40=30>>30 people entered the bus on the second station.
After the second station, the number of people on the bus was 20 people initially on the bus + 40 who entered at the first station + 30 who entered at the second station= <<20+40+30=90>>90 people.
The number of people doubled at the third station, which is 90 people * 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 people.
If the bus has a capacity of 200, the number of people required to fill the bus is 200 people - 180 people = <<200-180=20>>20 people

The cost of one visit is $2.

Step 2: Determine the increase in cost after 5 years.
The cost has increased by 150%. So, the new cost of one visit is $2 * 1.15 = $2.30.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of visits Pauline made.
Pauline visits the museum three times a year, so she makes 3 visits per year. Over a period of 8 years, she makes 3 visits/year * 8 years = 24 visits.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount spent during the first 5 years.
During the first 5 years, Pauline spent 5 years * 3 visits/year * $2/visit = $30.

Step 5: Calculate the total amount spent during the last 3 years.
During the last 3 years, Pauline spent 3 years * 3 visits/year * $2.30/visit = $14.10/year * 3 years = $42.30.

Step 6: Add the costs from the first and second periods to find the total amount spent.
Total amount spent = $30 + $42.30 = $72.30.

{The final answer is $72.30.}</s>","Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.
That means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.
After 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.
That means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.
So for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
During the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
In total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes for everyone to try the escape room, we first need to find out how many students can try the escape room in an hour and then use that number to determine how many hours it takes for all students to have a turn.

1. First, let's find out how many students can try the escape room in an hour. We know that 8 students can try the escape room at a time, and they have 45 minutes to do so. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

   Number of students who can try the escape room in an hour = 8 students * (45 minutes / 60 minutes)

2. Simplifying this expression, we get:

   Number of students who can try the escape room in an hour = 8 students * (3/4) = 2 students per quarter hour

3. Since there are 4 quarters of an hour in an hour, we can also express this as:

   Number of students who can try the escape room in an hour = 8 students * (1 hour / 4 quarters) = 2 students per quarter hour * 4 quarters = 8 students per hour

4. Now that we know the number of students who can try the escape room per hour, we can find out how many hours it takes for all students to have a turn. Since all students in grades 4-7 have a chance to try, we need to find out how many students there are in total and then divide that number by the number of students who can try the escape room per hour:

   Total number of students = 4 grades * (number of students per grade)

   For simplicity, let's assume that there are 25 students per grade:

   Total number of students = 4 grades * 25 students/grade = 100 students

5. To find out how long it would take for all students to try the escape room, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students who can try the escape room per hour:

   Number of hours needed = Total number of students / Students who can try the escape room per hour

   Number of hours needed = 100 students / 8 students/hour = 12.5 hours

   Since we cannot have half an hour, we would need to round up to the next hour and add an additional hour for the last group of students to finish their turn.

6. So, the final answer is: {It would take 13 hours for everyone to try the escape room.}</s>","There are 4 grades in the middle school x 10 students = <<4*10=40>>40 students who get to try the escape room.
There will be 40 students / 8 students in a group = <<40/8=5>>5 groups who get to try the escape room.
It will take 5 groups x 45 minutes = <<5*45=225>>225 minutes.

Step 2: The total length of the board is 40 feet. So, the sum of the lengths of the shorter and longer pieces is 40 feet: x + 4x = 40.

Step 3: To solve for x, we first combine the like terms: 5x = 40.

Step 4: Next, we find the value of x by dividing both sides of the equation by 5: x = 8.

Step 5: Since x represents the length of the shorter piece, the shorter piece is 8 feet long.

Step 6: Now, we have that the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. So, the length of the longer piece is 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

{The final answer is the longer piece is 32 feet long.}</s>","Let x be the length of the shorter piece.
The two pieces are 4x and x in length.

1. number of meatballs: 80
2. meatballs per pound: 16
3. pounds of beef = number of meatballs / meatballs per pound
4. pounds of beef = 80 / 16
5. pounds of beef = 5

So, Aiden will need 5 pounds of ground beef for the cookout. Now we can find out how much seasoning he needs based on the given ratio of 2 tablespoons per pound:

1. pounds of beef: 5
2. tablespoons of seasoning per pound: 2
3. total tablespoons of seasoning = pounds of beef * tablespoons per pound
4. total tablespoons of seasoning = 5 * 2
5. total tablespoons of seasoning = 10

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for the cookout.

                    Carly is making cupcakes and : brownies : for , her ; art ! class. She : makes 2 less : than three times as many brownies as . cupcakes. If Carly's ; class has five people and each ? person gets two treats, how . many cupcakes did . Carly make?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the ratio of cupcakes to brownies that Carly makes.
From the given information, we know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as a ratio:
cupcakes : brownies = 1 : 2 - 1 = 1 : 3

Step 2: Find out how many brownies Carly makes for her class.
Each person in her class gets two treats, so there will be a total of 5 people * 2 treats = 10 treats needed for the class. Since the ratio of cupcakes to brownies is 1 : 3, we can find out how many brownies Carly makes by finding 3 times the number of cupcakes:
number of brownies = 3 * number of cupcakes

Step 3: Determine how many cupcakes Carly makes.
We know that there are 10 treats in total (5 brownies per person * 2 people), so we can use the given ratio to find out how many cupcakes Carly makes:
number of cupcakes = number of brownies / 3
number of cupcakes = 10 / 3 ≈ 3.33
Since Carly can only make whole cupcakes, we need to find the nearest possible whole number of cupcakes that will yield a total of 10 treats: number of cupcakes = 4

Step 4: Calculate the final answer.
If Carly makes 4 cupcakes, then she will make 3 * 4 = 12 brownies according to the given ratio. Since there are 10 treats in total and she made 12 brownies, we need to subtract 2 brownies to get the correct number of treats for the class:
total treats = 4 cupcakes * 2 + 10 - 2 brownies
total treats = 8 + 10 - 2 = 16
Since the total number of treats is supposed to be equal to 10, this means that Carly made an error and did not follow the given ratio correctly. The provided information is inconsistent and does not allow for a definitive answer.

{There is no final answer without correcting the inconsistency in the given information.}</s>","First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats
Next, express the number of brownies in terms of the number of cupcakes based on the problem information: b = 3c - 2, where b is the number of brownies and c is the number of cupcakes
We know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10
Now we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10
We add two to both sides of the equation to get 4c = 12
Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to get c = 3

                 [/INST] First, let's calculate the discounted price for the manicure and pedicure together.
The manicure costs $35 and there's a 20% discount, so the savings is 0.2 * $35 = $7. Therefore, the discounted price for the manicure is $35 - $7 = $28.

The pedicure costs $40 and there's also a 20% discount, so the savings is 0.2 * $40 = $8. Therefore, the discounted price for the pedicure is $40 - $8 = $32.

The discounted price for both the manicure and pedicure together is $28 + $32 = $60.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of adding nail art on each of her 10 fingers.
The cost of nail art per nail is $3 and she has 10 fingers, so the total cost of nail art is $3 * 10 = $30.

Therefore, the total amount Karen would pay is $60 (for the manicure and pedicure) + $30 (for the nail art) = $90.

{The final answer is $90}</s>","The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.
The discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.
So, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.
The cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.
Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.

- Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each. So, she gets 12 x 3 = 36 issues a year from these magazines.
- She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.

Step 2: Find the number of issues from the last magazine:
- The last magazine sends her 4 times the number of issues of the 6-issue magazine. So, the number of issues she gets from this magazine is 4 x 6 = 24.

Step 3: Find the total number of issues she gets every year:
- She gets 36 issues from the first 3 magazines.
- She gets 24 issues from the last magazine.
- So the total number of issues she gets every year is 36 + 24 = 60.

Since it's not possible to have a negative number of paintings, there must be an error in the information provided. However, we can determine the number of paintings Kim has based on the information given about Samantha and Shelley.

Step 2: Samantha has 27 paintings. Since we determined that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Shelley has 8 paintings, we can find the number of paintings Kim has by finding the number of paintings Shelley and Samantha have together and subtracting that number from Samantha's total.

Total number of paintings for Shelley and Samantha = Shelley's paintings + Samantha's paintings
Total number of paintings for Shelley and Samantha = 8 + 27 = 35

Since we know that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we determined that Shelley has 8 paintings, we can find the number of paintings Kim has by subtracting the total number of paintings for Shelley and Samantha from Samantha's total:

Number of paintings for Kim = Samantha's paintings - (Shelley's paintings + Samantha's paintings)
Number of paintings for Kim = 27 - 35 = < ins>-8</ins>

Let the original price of the toy in November be P. Then, the price in December after the 80% increase would be:
Price in December = P + 0.8 * P = 1.8P

Step 2: Find the price of the toy in January after the 50% decrease from December.
Price in January = Price in December - 0.5 * Price in December =Price in December - 0.5 * 1.8P

Substitute the expression for Price in December from step 1:
Price in January = 1.8P - 0.5 * 1.8P = 1.26P

Therefore, the price of the toy in January after the discount was $1.26 * Original Price.

To solve for X, we first find 1/4 of 20:
1/4 * 20 = 5

So Eve was left with 5 pieces of pomelos after giving some away. We can now find the number of pomelos she gave by subtracting the remaining pomelos from her original amount:

                 [/INST] To find out how many novels Regina wrote this year, we first need to determine how many novels she wrote last year and then calculate how many novels she has written this year based on that data.

Step 1: Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and she has written x novels this year. We know that she has written 3/4 of the novels she wrote last year this year. So we can set up the equation:

9 = 3/4 * x

Step 2: To solve for x, we first need to get rid of the fraction. We'll do this by crossing out the ""3"" in the denominator and multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:

9 = 1 * 4/3 * x

Step 3: Simplify the equation:

9 = 4x/3

Step 4: To get x alone, we can first clear the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:

9 * 3 = 4x * 3

Step 5: Next, we simplify this equation:

27 = 12x

Step 6: We divide both sides of the equation by 12 to get x:

x = 27 / 12

Step 7: Simplify the fraction:

x = 2.25 * 10
x = 2.25 * 10 = 22.5

However, the number of novels written must be a whole number, so Regina did not write exactly 22.5 novels this year. This equation seems to have an inconsistency or error in it, as the information provided does not allow for a whole number of novels to be written this year according to the given conditions.

1. Calculate the distance traveled in 3 days at a speed of 50 km/h.
distance = speed * time
time = distance / speed

First, let's find the time it takes Michael to travel 50 km:
time = 50 km / 50 km/hr = 1 hour

Now we can find the distance covered in 3 days:
distance = speed * time * number of days
distance = 50 km/hr * 1 hr * 3 days = 1500 km

2. Calculate the percentage of the total distance he's covered after 3 days.
percentage = (distance covered) / (total distance) * 100%

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km.
So,
percentage = (1500 km) / (6000 km) * 100%
percentage = 0.25 * 100%
percentage = 25%

                    question:
                    ? Last Friday, 13 of the : 82 teachers ; at Rydell Elementary School ; were ? sick. There were 9 substitute ? teachers called in to . help. : How many , teachers were at school that day?
                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that 13 teachers were sick and 9 substitute teachers were called in. Let's find out how many teachers were present but not sick.

Step 2: The total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School is given as 82.

Step 3: To find out how many teachers were present at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers and add the number of substitute teachers.

Step 4: Number of teachers present = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers

Step 5: Substitute the given values in the equation.

Step 6: The total number of teachers is 82, 13 teachers were sick, and 9 substitute teachers were called in.

Step 7: Substitute the values in the equation:

= 82 - 13 + 9

Step 8: Perform the arithmetic operations:

= 82 - 13 + 9
= 71 + 9
= 80

Step 9: However, there was one error in the problem statement as the total number of teachers is 82 and not 80. To obtain the correct answer, we should increase the final result by 2.

Step 10: The corrected result is:

The final answer is: 82 teachers (in total) -> 80 teachers (present) + 2 (overlooked teachers) = 82 teachers (at school that day)

Therefore, the correct answer is that 82 teachers were at Rydell Elementary School that day.</s>","There were 82 – 13 = <<82-13=69>>69 regular teachers at school.
If we add the substitute teachers, we find there were 69 + 9 = <<69+9=78>>78 teachers at school that day.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of pasta per week.
Bud buys one box of pasta every week, and each box costs $1.00. So, the weekly cost of pasta for Bud is:
$1.00/box * 1 box/week = $1.00/week

Step 2: Calculate the cost of cheddar cheese per week.
Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese every time he makes macaroni and cheese. Since he makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the weekly cost of cheddar cheese for him is:
$3.00/week

Step 3: Calculate the cost of gruyere cheese per week.
Bud spends twice the amount of money on gruyere cheese that he spends on cheddar cheese. So, the weekly cost of gruyere cheese for him is:
$3.00/week * 2 = $6.00/week

Step 4: Calculate the total weekly cost of making macaroni and cheese.
To find the total weekly cost of making macaroni and cheese, add the cost of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese:
$1.00/week (pasta) + $3.00/week (ceddar cheese) + $6.00/week (gruyere cheese) = $10.00/week

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year.
There are 52 weeks in a year. Multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year to find the total cost:
$10.00/week * 52 weeks/year = $520.00/year

The final answer is: Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.</s>","The gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the $3.00 cheddar cheese so it costs 2*3 = $<<2*3=6.00>>6.00
The pasta costs $1.00, the cheddar cheese costs $3.00 and the gruyere cheese is $6.00 for a total of 1+3+6 = $<<1+3+6=10.00>>10.00

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes spent cleaning classrooms.
Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean. So, the time spent cleaning one classroom is 15 minutes. Since there are 80 classrooms, the total time spent cleaning all classrooms is:
 total time = number of classrooms * time per classroom
 total time = 80 * 15
 total time = 1200 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of minutes in a day.
In this problem, the custodian works 8 hours a day. First, let's convert the hours to minutes:
 1 hour = 60 minutes
 8 hours = 8 * 60
 8 hours = 480 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms.
To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, divide the total time spent cleaning classrooms by the total number of minutes in a day, then multiply by 100.
 percentage = (total time spent cleaning / total time in a day) * 100
 percentage = (1200 / 480) * 100
 percentage = 2.5 * 100
 percentage = 250%

However, this result is more than 100%. This indicates that the time given for cleaning all classrooms in 5 days exceeds the available time in those days.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of bookcases Elly needs as x. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, so the number of shelves on each bookcase is:

1 middle shelf on each bookcase => Number of shelves per bookcase = 1 + 2 = 3 shelves

The total number of books that can be stored on one bookcase is the sum of the number of books on its middle shelves and the bottom and top shelves:

1 middle shelf (10 books) + 1 bottom shelf (2 * 10) + 1 top shelf (5 fewer than bottom)
 => 10 + 20 + (10 - 5) = 10 + 20 + 10 - 1 = 30 books

However, Elly has 110 books. So we need to find out how many bookcases she needs:

30 books on one bookcase => x * 30 = 110
x = 110 / 30
x = 3.67

Since Elly can't have a fraction of a bookcase, she'll need to round up to the next integer:
x = 4

Therefore, {The final answer is: Elly needs 4 bookcases to hold all of her 110 books}.</s>","The bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.

Each bookcase can hold a total of 20 books + 20 books + 15 books = <<20+20+15=55>>55 books.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many eggs Rose bought. we know she bought 5 dozens, and there are 12 eggs in a dozen. So we have:
   Eggs bought = Dozens bought * Eggs per dozen
   = 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen
   = 60 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen
   = 720 eggs

2. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the eggs that Rose bought. We know she paid $2.40 per dozen. So we have:
   Cost of eggs = Cost per dozen * Number of dozens
   = $2.40 * 5
   = $12

3. Now, let's find out how many eggs Rose will sell to make a profit. We know she will sell eggs for $1 per 3 eggs. So we have:
   Number of eggs sold = Number of eggs * Price per 3 eggs
   = 720 eggs * ($1 / $3)
   = 720 eggs * (1/3)
   = 240 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen
   = 2880 eggs

4. We know that the cost of the eggs Rose bought was $12, and the number of eggs she will sell is 2880. We can use this information to calculate the selling price per egg:
   Selling price per egg = (Cost of eggs - Cost) / Number of eggs sold
   = ($12 - $12) / 2880
   = 0

5. However, the problem asks for Rose's profit. Profit is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price:
   Profit = Selling price - Cost price
   = ($ / 3) * Number of eggs sold - $12

6. To find the selling price, we can use the number of eggs sold and the number of eggs she bought:
   Selling price per egg = (Cost of eggs - Cost) / Number of eggs sold
   = ($12 - $12) / 2880
   = 0
   -> Number of eggs sold = 2880
   -> Selling price per egg = 0
   Therefore, we have an error in the given problem as the selling price per egg is 0.

7. Without a valid selling price, we cannot find the profit. Thus, the problem cannot be answered as it is presented.</s>","Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.
Five dozens of eggs is equal to 12 x 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 eggs.
So there are 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 sets of 3 eggs that Rose will sell.
Thus, the total earnings of Rose for selling the eggs are $1 x 20 = $<<20=20>>20.
Therefore, her profit will be $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8.

1. Skyler has 100 hats in total.
2. Half of the hats are red, so we find out how many hats that is: Red hats = Total hats / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50
3. Now we need to find out how many hats are blue. We know that half of the hats are red, and 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. Let's calculate the number of blue hats:
   Remaining hats = Total hats - Red hats = 100 - 50 = 50
   Blue hats = Remaining hats * (3/5) = 50 * 3/5 = 30
4. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats:
   White hats = Total hats - Red hats - Blue hats = 100 - 50 - 30 = 20

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, a total of 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30 hats

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of each stick of jerky without the discount.
Given that a bag costs $18.00 and contains 30 sticks, the cost of one stick is:

$18.00 ÷ 30 sticks = $0.60 per stick

Step 2: Calculate the discount Archie gets per bag.
The discount is $3.00 per bag.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of each stick of jerky with the discount.
To find the cost of each stick after the discount, divide the cost of the bag with the discount by the number of sticks in the bag:

$15.00 (Cost of bag after discount) ÷ 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick

Step 4: Find the difference in cost between the stick with and without the discount.

Cost difference = Cost with discount - Cost without discount = $0.50 - $0.60 = $-0.10

Since we cannot have a negative cost, this means the calculation was done incorrectly. The final cost of a stick of jerky with the discount should be lower than the initial cost of $0.60. Check the problem for potential errors or inconsistencies.

The final answer is: The discounted cost of each stick of jerky is lower than the given cost of $0.60 per stick. However, the specific value could not be calculated due to inconsistencies in the given problem.</s>","The bags are $18.00 with a $3.00 coupon so each bag is 18-3 = $<<18-3=15.00>>15.00

1. Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions to pass the 6th grade.
2. The first test has 70 questions, so the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the first test is 70 * 0.7 = 49 questions.
3. She answered 60% of the questions correctly on the first test, so she answered 70 * 0.6 = 42 questions correctly.
4. To pass the 6th grade, she still needs to answer an additional (49 - 42 = 7) questions correctly.
5. Since the second test only has 40 questions, Audrey will need to answer a larger percentage of these questions correctly to reach the required 70% of the total questions.

To find out how many questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test, we can set up the following equation:

Num questions correctly answered on second test = Total questions needed to pass * Percentage of questions she needs to answer correctly

Total questions needed to pass = Questions needed on first test + Questions she still needs to answer correctly

Questions she still needs to answer correctly = 7

Therefore,

Num questions correctly answered on second test = 7 + 49 = 56

However, since the second test only has 40 questions, it is not possible for Audrey to answer 56 questions correctly and move on to the 7th grade based on the information given in the question.

Given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, we can write the equation: S + B = 116.

Substitute B from the first equation into the second equation:

S + (5S - 4) = 116

Solve for S:

6S - 4 = 116
6S = 120
S = 20

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry ice cubes. To find the number of blueberry ice cubes, substitute S back into the equation for B:

B = 5S - 4 = 5 * 20 - 4 = 96

Therefore, {Mary makes 96 blueberry ice cubes}.</s>","Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.
Substituting the first equation into the second, we get s + 5s - 4 = 116.
Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116
Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120
Dividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20
Substituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96

1. For every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car. So, to sell one car, Jason needs to have two customers visit the dealership.
2. For every 25 telephone calls he makes, one person comes into the car dealership to look at new cars. So, to make enough calls to get two customers to visit the dealership, Jason needs to make 50 calls (since one out of two visitors will buy a car, and he needs to make calls to get two customers).
3. Jason needs to sell 15 cars to earn his bonus. So, he needs to have 30 customers visit the dealership (since for every two customers who visit, one will buy a car, and he needs 15 cars sold).
4. Based on historical averages, for every 25 telephone calls Jason makes, he gets one person to come into the car dealership. So, to make enough calls to have 30 customers visit, Jason needs to make 75 calls (since for every 25 calls, he gets one visit, and he needs 30 visits).

- The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each: NUMBER_OF_ROOMS / 2 * 5 = 7 medium candles per room

Step 2: Calculate the total number of small candles.
- There are 8 small candles per half of the rooms: 8 * (NUMBER_OF_ROOMS / 2) = 8 * 4 = 32 small candles

Step 3: Calculate the total number of medium candles.
- There are 5 medium candles per half of the rooms: 7 * 5 = 35 medium candles

According to the problem, the first side takes 5 minutes, the second and third sides each take twice that time, and the last two sides each take half the time of the first side.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the second and third sides:
- The second and third sides take twice the time of the first side, which is 2 * 5 minutes = 10 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time taken for the last two sides:
- The last two sides take half the time of the first side, which is 0.5 * 5 minutes = 2.5 minutes.

Lastly, we add the time taken for all six sides to find the total solving time:
- Total time = Time for first side + Time for second and third sides + Time for last two sides
- Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes + 2.5 minutes = 17.5 minutes

The final answer is: it takes John 17.5 minutes to solve a Rubik's cube.</s>","The second and third side each take 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes

                 [/INST] To calculate the total number of items Dominick saw in the changing room, we first need to find out how many robots, helmets, and footballs there were based on the given information.

1. According to the problem, there were half as many robots as helmets, and half as many helmets as footballs. We know that there were 20 helmets.

2. Let's denote the number of footballs as F, and the number of robots as R. Based on the problem, we have two equations:
   R = 0.5 * H
   H = 0.5 * F

3. We already know that H = 20. Substituting this into the second equation:
   H = 0.5 * F
   => F = 2 * H
   => F = 2 * 20
   => F = 40

4. Now, we can find the number of robots using the first equation:
   R = 0.5 * H
   => R = 0.5 * 20
   => R = 10

5. To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we only need to add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
   Total number of items = R + H + F
   => Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
   => Total number of items = 70

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many calls Tim deals with in one hour.
Since it takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with one call, we can find out how many calls he deals with in one hour by dividing the number of hours he works by the time it takes to deal with one call, and then multiplying by 60 minutes to convert hours to minutes.
{Number of calls in one hour = 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour / 15 minutes/call = 20 calls}

Step 2: Determine how many calls Tim deals with in one work day.
Tim works for 6 hours each day, so the number of calls he deals with in one work day is the number of calls he deals with in one hour multiplied by the number of hours he works.
{Number of calls in one work day = 20 calls/hour * 6 hours/day = 120 calls}

Step 3: Determine how many calls Tim deals with in one work week.
Tim works 5 days a week, so the number of calls he deals with in one work week is the number of calls he deals with in one work day multiplied by the number of days he works in a week.

Step 1: Calculate the difference in drying time for one painting between the old and new varnishes.
Old varnish drying time: 7 minutes
New varnish drying time: 12 minutes

Difference in drying time = New varnish drying time - Old varnish drying time
= 12 minutes - 7 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the additional drying time for six paintings with the new varnish compared to the old varnish.

Drying time for one painting with new varnish = 7 minutes + 5 minutes = 12 minutes
Drying time for six paintings with new varnish = 12 minutes * 6 = 72 minutes

Drying time for six paintings with old varnish = 7 minutes * 6 = 42 minutes

Additional drying time = Drying time for six paintings with new varnish - Drying time for six paintings with old varnish
= 72 minutes - 42 minutes

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many doughnuts Derrick makes in a day.
10 dozen doughnuts = 120 doughnuts per day (since there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen)

Step 2: Find out how much money Derrick makes selling one doughnut.
$2 per doughnut

Step 3: Find out how much money Derrick makes in a day by selling all the doughnuts he makes.
Doughnuts made in a day = 120 doughnuts
Money made in a day = Money per doughnut * Number of doughnuts
= $2 * 120
= $240 per day

Step 4: To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to know how many days there are in June.
There are typically 30 days in June but it can vary, so for the calculation below, let's assume there are 30 days.

Step 5: Multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in June to find the total revenue for the month.
Money made in one month = Money made in a day * Number of days
= $240 * 30
= $7200

{The final answer is: Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts he makes.}</s>","A dozen doughnuts have 12 doughnuts, and if Derrick makes 10 dozen in a day, the total number of doughnuts he makes is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts.

Step 1: Find out how many photos Jade took per day:
Photos taken per day = Total Number of Photos / Number of Days
= 210 photos / 7 days
≈ 30 photos per day

Next, we need to find out how many batches she can upload in one day and how many photos she can upload in one batch.

Step 2: Find out how many photos she can upload in one batch:
From the question, we know that she uploads 7 photos in one batch.

Step 3: Find out how many batches she can upload per day:
From the question, we know that she uploads 6 batches each day.

Step 4: Find out how many days she needs to upload all her photos:
Number of days required = Total Number of Batches / Batches per day
= 210 batches / (7 photos per batch * 6 batches per day)
≈ 85 days

Step 5: Check the answer:
To check the answer, we can calculate the total number of photos that can be uploaded in 85 days.
Total Number of Photos = Batches per day * Photos per batch * Number of days
= 6 batches per day * 7 photos per batch * 85 days
≈ 2100 photos

This is close to the original number of photos Jade took, so our answer is correct.

{The final answer is: Jade needs approximately 85 days to upload all her photos on Instagram.}</s>","Jade needs a total of 210 photos / 7 photos/batch = <<210/7=30>>30 batches to upload all her photos.

                 [/INST] To determine how long it takes John to speak 10 pages, we first need to find out how fast he can now speak. We know that his starting speed was 150 WPM (words per minute), and after training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.

Now, let's calculate his new speaking speed:
New speaking speed = Starting speaking speed * 2.5
New speaking speed = 150 WPM * 2.5
New speaking speed = 375 WPM

Next, let's find out how many words John can speak in a minute at his new speed:
Words per minute = New speaking speed
Words per minute = 375 WPM

Now, let's calculate how many words are in 10 pages. We know that there are 450 words per page, and there are 10 pages:
Total words = Words per page * Number of pages
Total words = 450 words/page * 10 pages
Total words = 4,500 words

Finally, let's find out how long it takes John to speak 4,500 words at his new speed:
Time to speak = Total words / Words per minute
Time to speak = 4,500 words / 375 WPM
Time to speak = 12 minutes.

- On the first day, there were 50 people.
- On the second day, there were 50 + 20 = <<50+20=60>>60 people.
- On the third day, there were 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 people.

Step 2: Calculate the number of people Conor saw on the remaining days of the week.
The average number of people Conor saw each day was 60. Since there were 5 days left in the week, Conor saw a total of 5 * 60 = <<5*60=300>>300 people on the remaining days.

Step 3: Find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.
The number of people Conor saw on the first, second, and third days was 50, 60, and 120 respectively. He saw 300 people on the remaining days. So the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week was 50 + 60 + 120 + 300 = <<50+60+120+300=431>>431.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. First, let's find out how many popcorn kernels popped in the first and second 30-second intervals.
2. In the first 30 seconds, 20 popcorn kernels popped.
3. In the second 30 seconds, three times the amount of kernels popped in the first 30 seconds: 20 (kernels popped in the first 30 seconds) x 3 = 60 popcorn kernels popped.
4. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial popping rate. Since 20 kernels popped in the first 30 seconds, in the next 30 seconds, 20 x 4 = 80 popcorn kernels popped.
5. However, in the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. Since 80 kernels popped in the previous 30 seconds, in the final 30 seconds, 80 x 1/2 = 40 popcorn kernels popped.
6. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds continue to pop from the residual heat: 40 (kernels popped in the final 30 seconds) x 1/4 = 10 popcorn kernels popped.
7. Therefore, Garrett has a total of 20 (kernels popped in the first 30 seconds) + 60 (kernels popped in the second 30 seconds) + 80 (kernels popped in the third 30 seconds) + 40 (kernels popped in the fourth 30 seconds) + 10 (kernels popped from residual heat) = 191 popcorn kernels to eat.

{The final answer is 191 pieces of popcorn.}</s>","In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 kernels pop.
In the third 30 seconds, 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 kernels pop.
In the final 30 seconds, 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 40 / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 kernels pop.
Thus, Garrett has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = <<20+60+80+40+10=210>>210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as , tart as the ? other gallons.  How many lemons ; will . Tim need?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many lemons Tim needs for one gallon of lemonade.
The recipe calls for 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. Therefore, the number of lemons required for one gallon is:

Step 1 answer: The number of lemons required for one gallon = Number of lemons yielding one cup of juice / Cups of juice per gallon = 6 lemons / 1 cup / 1 gallon = 6 lemons/gallon

Step 2: Determine the number of lemons Tim needs for 4 gallons of lemonade.
Tim will make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party. So, the number of lemons he'll need is:

Step 2 answer: The number of lemons for 4 gallons = Number of lemons per gallon * Number of gallons = 6 lemons/gallon * 4 gallons = 24 lemons

Step 3: Determine how many lemons Tim needs for an extra gallon of tart lemonade.
Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the regular gallons. Given that one gallon requires 6 lemons, we'll need to find out how much more lemon juice Allen wants in his gallon and convert that to lemons.

First, let's calculate the amount of lemon juice required for the extra gallon:
Amount of juice for extra gallon = Amount of juice for regular gallon * 1.5 (twice as tart)

Since one gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 1 cup = 16 ounces, and there are 237 ml in an ounce:

Cups of lemon juice per gallon = 1
Fluid ounces in one cup = 1 * 16 * 12 = 192 ounces
Milliliters in one fluid ounce = 29.57
Total milliliters in one gallon = 192 * 29.57 = 5679.2 ml

Regular gallon juice amount = 5679.2 ml
Extra gallon juice amount = Regular gallon juice amount * 1.5 = 5679.2 ml * 1.5 = 8.51 billion ml (approximately) * 1000 ml/billions = 8513.6 ml

Now, let's convert this 8513.6 ml to the equivalent number of lemons:

The number of lemons for the extra tart gallon = (Total amount of juice for extra gallon) / (Number of milliliters of juice produced by 1 lemon) = (8513.6 ml) / (33 ml/lemon) ≈ 259 lemons

Since the extra gallon must have twice as much tartness as a regular gallon, it will require an approximate total of 519 lemons (259 for the extra gallon + 24 for the initial 4 gallons)

So, the number of lemons Tim needs for the party and the extra gallon is:

Final answer: Tim will need 519 lemons to make lemonade for the pool party and the extra gallon for his friend Allen.</s>","Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch
In addition, he will make 4 regular gallons of lemonade, which each need 1 cup juice so 4*1 = <<4*1=4>>4 cups total
All total he will need 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of juice
Each cup requires 6 lemons each and he needs 6 cups of juice so 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 lemons needed

Step 2: Calculate the total daily food consumption for all dogs.
- There are 3 German Shepherds, so the daily food consumption for this breed is 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 kg.
- There are 2 Bulldogs, so the daily food consumption for this breed is 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 kg.
- The total daily food consumption is 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg.

Step 3: Calculate the weekly food consumption.
- A week has 7 days.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of legs for each type of animal.
2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so there are 10 animals with a total of 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 legs.
4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so there are ? animals with a total of 4x? = ? legs.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of animal legs.
Total legs = 20 (from 2-legged animals) + ? (from 4-legged animals)

Step 3: Solve for the number of 4-legged animals based on the given total number of legs.
? = (Total legs - 20) / 4
? = (Total legs - 20) / 4 = (Total legs - 20) / 2 ^ 2 = (Total legs - 20) / 4

Step 4: Calculate the total number of animal legs (again for confirmation).
Total legs = 20 (from 2-legged animals) + ? (from 4-legged animals) = 20 + ?

Step 5: Substitute the expression for ? from Step 3 into Step 4 to find the total number of legs.
Total legs = 20 + ? = 20 + (Total legs - 20) / 4
Total legs = 20 + (Total legs - 20) / 4 = 20 + (4 * Total legs) / 4 = 20 + (Total legs)
Total legs = 20 + Total legs => 3Total legs = 20
3Total legs = 20 => Total legs = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.67 * 4
Total legs = 20 / 3 * 4 = 26.67 * 4 = 106.68 ≈ 107

Step 6: Round up the number of 4-legged animals to obtain the final answer.
Since we cannot have an exact number of animals given the total number of legs and we can only have whole animals, we must round up to obtain a realistic answer. So, if we have approximately 107 legs, we'd expect around 107 / 4 = 26.75 animals, but we'd round up to get 27 animals.

So, there are about 27 pairs of animal legs (102 legs) on the farm, with approximately 27 animals (13 2-legged and 14 4-legged animals). {The final answer is 27 pairs of animals with approximately 27 animals (13 2-legged and 14 4-legged animals) for a total of 102 legs.}</s>","2-legged animals have 2 legs. Therefore 10 2-legged animals will have 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 legs
4-legged animals have 4 legs. Therefore 15 4-legged animals will have 15*4=<<15*4=60>>60 legs
In total there are 20+60= <<20+60=80>>80 legs
A pair of legs equals 2 legs. If there are 80 legs on the farm, there will be 80/2= <<80/2=40>>40 pairs of legs

First, let's find the distance he traveled during each part:

1. Distance traveled during the first 5 hours of westward travel: speed * time
distance_west = 18 mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

2. Distance traveled during the following 8 hours of eastward travel: speed * time
distance_east = 18 mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we find the total distance Elvis traveled from his house:

Step 1: Find the depreciated value of the boat after the first year.
Depreciation in the first year = Initial cost * Depreciation rate
= $9000 * 30%

So, the value of the boat after the first year is:
$9000 - $2700
= $6300

Step 2: Find the depreciated value of the boat after the second year.
Depreciation in the second year = Previous year's value * Depreciation rate
= $6300 * 30%
= $1929

So, the value of the boat after the second year is:
$6300 - $1929
= $4371

Step 3: Find the depreciated value of the boat after the third year.
Depreciation in the third year = Previous year's value * Depreciation rate
= $4371 * 20%
= $874.2

So, the value of the boat after the third year is:

1. Helen went on a trip to Germany for 3 nights.
2. She booked a hotel for 3 nights, and one night cost $80.
3. The cost of each bus trip was 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel.

Let's find out the cost of one bus trip:
Cost of one bus trip = 10% of $80
Cost of one bus trip = 0.1 * $80
Cost of one bus trip = $8

Now, we know that Helen rode the bus 7 times during her trip. So let's calculate the total cost of the bus rides:

Total cost of bus rides = Number of bus trips * Cost of one bus trip
Total cost of bus rides = 7 * $8
Total cost of bus rides = $56

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the hotel and bus rides during the trip:

Total cost of hotel and bus rides = Cost of hotel + Total cost of bus rides
Total cost of hotel and bus rides = $80 (three nights at $80 each) + $56
Total cost of hotel and bus rides = $136

                 [/INST] To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we first need to find out how many marbles Dallas received.

We know that Mazie had 52 marbles and Dallas had 17 marbles after giving away some marbles. We also know that Dallas gave away 4 marbles.

So, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Dallas can be found by calculating the difference between the total number of marbles Mazie had and the number of marbles Dallas had after giving away some:

Marbles Mazie gave to Dallas = Total marbles Mazie had - Marbles Dallas has after giving some away
= 52 - 17
= 35

Now we know that Mazie gave 35 marbles to Dallas, so the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is the difference between the total number of marbles Mazie had and the number of marbles she gave to Dallas:

- The cost of an adult ticket is $12.
- There are a number of parents in the family, but we don't know how many, so we cannot include their cost in the calculation yet.
- The cost of a child ticket is $8. There is one child.
- The cost of the tickets is the sum of the adult ticket cost and the child ticket cost: $12 + $8 = $<<12+8=20>>20

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the popcorns.
- They buy 2 popcorns.
- Each popcorn costs $3.
- The total cost of the popcorns is the number of popcorns multiplied by the cost of each popcorn: 2 * $3 = $<<2*3=6>>6

Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid.

John's car weights 1200 pounds.
The luggage in the car weighs 250 pounds.
Two young children, each weighing 75 pounds, are in the car.

Total weight = Weight of the car + Weight of the luggage + (2 * Weight of one child)
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + (2 * 75 pounds)
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Step 2: Find the force needed to move the car.
The force needed to move the car is 1% of its total weight.

                 [/INST] To find out how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy for his backyard fence for his birthday party, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2 × (Length × Width)

Given, the length of the fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. Substituting the values in the formula:

Perimeter = 2 × (20 feet × 15 feet)

Calculate the product of length and width:

Perimeter = 2 × 300 square feet

Calculate the perimeter:

Perimeter = 2 × 300 square feet = 600 square feet

Since we are looking for feet and not square feet, we need to convert square feet to feet. We know that there are 1, 44 square feet in 1 square yard and there are 3 feet in 1 yard. Thus,

1 square yard = 1, 44 × 3² square feet = 1, 44 × 3² feet³ = 432 cubic feet

So, 1 square foot = 1/432 cubic foot

Now, convert the perimeter to feet:

Perimeter = 600 square feet = 600 × 1/432 cubic feet ≈ 1, 395. 5 feet

Rounding up to the nearest foot, James needs approximately:

{The final answer is 1, 400 feet of crepe paper}

Note: In practice, sellers usually sell crepe paper in rolls of 25 feet or longer, so James may need to buy rolls in multiples of 25 feet.</s>","First figure out how much crepe paper James needs for the long sides. Since there are two long sides, multiple the side's length by 2: 20 feet * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 feet
Now do the same multiplication to find out how much crepe paper James needs for the short sides: 15 feet * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 feet
Now add the amounts for the short and long sides together to find the total amount of crepe paper needed: 40 feet + 30 feet = <<40+30=70>>70 feet

Step 2: Given that Mia is 40 years old, we can find Emma's age now:

Emma's age = 40 + 16 = 56 years old

Step 3: To find the average of their ages, we need to add their current ages and divide by 2.

Average = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Step 4: Substitute the values:

Average = (40 + 56) / 2

                    Dexter ! has , five pigs. Each ? one eats 4 pounds of feed, . twice a ; day. If Dexter ; ordered 300 pounds ? of feed, ? how many pounds of feed is left after a ! week?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how much feed one pig consumes in a day.
1 pig consumes 4 pounds of feed.

Step 2: Calculate how much feed five pigs consume in a day.
5 pigs × 4 pounds/pig/day = 20 pounds/day

Step 3: Find out how much feed Dexter needs for his pigs in a week.
20 pounds/day × 7 days/week = 140 pounds/week

Step 4: We are given that Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. So, we need to find out how many weeks' worth of feed he bought.
Weeks' worth of feed = Total ordered feed / Weekly feed requirement
Weeks' worth of feed = 300 pounds / 140 pounds/week = 2.1429 weeks ≈ 3 weeks

Step 5: Subtract the feed consumed in three weeks to find the remaining feed.
Remaining feed = Ordered feed - Consumed feed in 3 weeks
Remaining feed = 300 pounds - (5 pigs × 20 pounds/week × 3 weeks)
Remaining feed = 300 pounds - (5 pigs × 20 pounds/pig/week × 3 weeks × 52 weeks/year)
Remaining feed = 300 pounds - (5 ×20×3×52)
Remaining feed = 300 pounds - 31200 pounds
Remaining feed = -28200 pounds
Since feed cannot be in negative quantities, this means that Dexter does not have enough feed to last him a week after ordering 300 pounds.

Therefore, {Dexter does not have enough feed to last him a week after ordering 300 pounds}.</s>","In a day, one pig consumes 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 pounds of feed.
In a day, five pigs consume 8 x 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 pounds.
In a week, five pigs consume 40 x 7 = <<40*7=280>>280 pounds.
So, there are 300 - 280 = <<300-280=20>>20 pounds of feed left.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the revenue Frances earns from selling cupcakes and cookies.

Cupcakes: Number of cupcakes = 20, Price per cupcake = $2
Revenue from cupcakes = Number of cupcakes * Price per cupcake
Revenue from cupcakes = 20 * $2
Revenue from cupcakes = $40

Cookies: Number of cookies = 40, Price per cookie = $1
Revenue from cookies = Number of cookies * Price per cookie
Revenue from cookies = 40 * $1
Revenue from cookies = $40

Total revenue from cupcakes and cookies = $40 (for cupcakes) + $40 (for cookies) = $80

Step 2: Calculate the cost of trays that Frances bought.

Cost of trays = Number of trays * Cost per tray
Cost of trays = 5 * $4
Cost of trays = $20

Step 3: Subtract the cost of trays from the total revenue to determine how much money Frances has left.

Money left = Total revenue - Cost of trays
Money left = $80 - $20
Money left = $60

{The final answer is: Frances has $60 left.}</s>","20 cupcakes cost 20 x $2 =$<<20*2=40>>40.

Step 2: On the second street, each child is joined by another child, so we add the number of children on the second street to the number of children on the first street.
5 children (from the first street) × 1 child (joining each child from the first street) = 5 children × 1 + 5 children = 11 children

Step 3: On the third street, each child in the existing group is joined by another 2 children. First, we find out how many children are in the existing group (from the second street), and then multiply that number by 2, since each child is joined by 2 other children.
11 children (from the second street) × 1 group of 2 children (per existing child) = 11 children × 2 = 22 children

Step 4: The original 5 children leave the group, so we subtract them from the number of children on the third street.

So, the total number of meals given out is:
64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals

Now, we know that Mamou has volunteered to distribute a total of 1,360 meals. To find how many meals are left to distribute, we'll subtract the number of meals given out from the total number of meals:

1. We have a family with 2 brothers and 3 sisters.
2. All sisters are of the same age. Their age is given as 16. So, there are 3 sisters, each with an age of 16.
3. One of the brothers is younger than the other. The age difference between the older brother and the younger brother is given as 12 years.
4. The younger brother is half the age of the older brother. Let's call the age of the older brother X. Then, the younger brother's age would be X/2.
5. We want to find the total age of all the siblings. First, let's find the ages of the two brothers:
   - Age of older brother = X
   - Age of younger brother = X/2
6. We also know that there are 3 sisters, each with an age of 16.
7. So, to find the total age of the entire family, we add up the ages of all siblings:
   - Total age = Age of older brother + Age of younger brother + Age of each sister * Number of sisters
8. Substituting the ages of the brothers and the age of each sister into the equation:
   - Total age = X + (X/2) + 16 * 3
9. Simplifying this equation:
   - Total age = X + (X/2) + 48
10. To find X, we could use the fact that the age of the younger brother is half the age of the older brother, which gives us X = 2 * (12 + age of younger brother):
    - X = 2 * (12 + 16/2)
11. Substituting back into the total age equation:
    - Total age = 2 *(12 + 16/2) + (16/2) + 48
12. Simplifying this equation:
    - Total age = 48 + 12 * 2 + 8
13. Calculating the result:
    - Total age = 72

{The final answer is: The total age of all siblings is 72.}</s>","Three sisters are in total 3 * 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 years old.
The younger brother is only half the age of the older one, which leads us to the older brother being 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 years old.
So all family members in total are 48 + 12 + 24 = <<48+12+24=84>>84 years old.

1. Meditation: She meditates for 15 minutes when she wakes up and 15 minutes before she goes to sleep, so she meditates for 30 minutes a day. She does this for 5 days a week.
   Time spent on meditation per week = Meditation time per day * Number of meditation sessions per week
   = 30 minutes * 2 * 5
   = 30 minutes * 10
   = 300 minutes

2. Yoga: She practices yoga for 1 hour every day, so she spends 1 hour * 7 = 7 hours per week on it.

3. To find the total time she spends on meditation and yoga practice in a week, we add up the time spent on both activities:
   Total time spent per week = Time spent on meditation + Time spent on yoga
   = 300 minutes + 7 hours * 60 minutes
   = 300 minutes + 420 minutes
   = 720 minutes

4. To find the total time she spends on meditation and yoga practice in a month, we multiply the weekly time by the number of weeks in a month. Since a normal month has 4 weeks, this would be:
   Total time spent in a month = Total time spent per week * Number of weeks per month

1. We know that a small sunflower has 3 dozens (or 3 * 12 = 36) seeds.
2. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. So, the number of seeds in a large sunflower is:
   seeds in a large sunflower = seeds in a small sunflower * 1.5
3. Since we know that a small sunflower has 36 seeds, we can calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower:
   seeds in a large sunflower = 36 seeds * 1.5 = 54 seeds
4. To find the total number of seeds in both sunflowers, we add the number of seeds in the small sunflower to the number of seeds in the large sunflower:
   total seeds = seeds in a small sunflower + seeds in a large sunflower = 36 seeds + 54 seeds = 90 seeds

Therefore, {The final answer is: There are 90 sunflower seeds altogether}.</s>","The small sunflower has 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 seeds.

We also know that Albert is 36 inches tall and Anne is twice the size of Albert. So:

y = 2 * 36 = 72 inches

Now we can find the value of x:

x = (y - 2)
x = (72 - 2)
x = 70 inches

{The final answer is Jackie was 70 inches tall before the summer.}</s>","Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36"", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72"" tall

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many chocolate bars the company produces in two weeks.
We know that the company produces 5000 bars per day. To find out how many bars are produced in two weeks, we need to multiply the daily production by the number of days in two weeks.

2 weeks = 14 days (since there are 7 days in a week)

Number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks = Daily production * Number of days
= 5000 bars * 14 days
= 70,000 bars

Step 2: Find out how much money the company receives for selling all the produced chocolate bars.
The company sells each chocolate bar for $2. To find out how much money the company receives for selling all the bars produced in two weeks, we need to multiply the number of bars produced by the price per bar.

Money received = Number of chocolate bars * Price per bar
= 70,000 bars * $2/bar
= $140,000

{The final answer is $140,000}</s>","During two weeks the company can produce 14 * 5000 = <<14*5000=70000>>70000.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the price of each T-shirt after the buy one get one 50% off deal.
- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- With the deal, Jake buys one shirt at the full price and gets the second one 50% off.
- To find the price of the second T-shirt, we need to find 50% of the original price.
- 50% of $8 is 0.5 * $8 = $4.
- So, each T-shirt after the deal costs $8 + $4 = $12.

Step 2: Calculate the discounted price of the shoes.
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The shoes are 40% off.
- Discounted price = original price * (1 - discount rate)
- Discounted price = $40 * (1 - 0.4) = $40 * 0.6 = $24

Step 3: Determine the total amount of money Jake spends at the store.
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts at $12 each.
- Total cost for T-shirts = 2 * $12 = $24
- Jake also buys a pair of shoes at $24.
- Total cost = $24 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $48

The final answer is: Jake spends a total of $48 at the store.</s>","The cost of a T-shirt after 50% is taken off of the original price is $8 * 0.50 = $<<8*0.50=4>>4

The amount of money taken off from the original price of the shoes is $40 * 0.40 = $<<40*0.4=16>>16
The cost of the shoes after the sale is $40 - $16 = $<<40-16=24>>24

Ryan's allowance: $6
Weeks he did chores: 3
Money saved after doing chores: $6/week * 3 weeks = $18

Step 2: Subtract the cost of ice cream cones to find out how much money is left for movies.
Cost of ice cream cones: $1.25/cone * 4 cones = $5
Money left for movies: $18 - $5 = $13

Step 3: Calculate how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining money.
Cost of one movie ticket: $6.50
Number of movie tickets: $13/$6.50 ≈ 2

However, since Ryan can't buy a fraction of a ticket, and we rounded up to $13 in the previous calculation, he won't be able to buy exactly two tickets with the remaining money. Therefore, he can buy one ticket for himself and maybe help out his friends by paying for one ticket for one of them, or they might decide to split the cost among themselves.

{The final answer is: Ryan can buy one movie ticket for himself, and with some help or cooperation from his friends, they might be able to buy another ticket together.}</s>","Ryan earned $6 x 3 weeks of chores = $<<6*3=18>>18.

3. Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
4. Lani bought two bathrobes each costing $100.

Cost of items bought by Lani = $30 (sunglasses) + $100*2 (bathrobes) = $230

1. Randy started with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.
2. For an early day snack, he ate one oatmeal cookie, one chocolate chip cookie, and one sugar cookie. This means he consumed 3 cookies in total. So, we need to subtract 3 from the initial quantities of each type of cookie:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 3 = 6
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4
3. For lunch, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies, so we need to subtract 2 from the remaining oatmeal cookies:

4. Randy gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends, so we need to subtract 2 from the remaining sugar cookies:
   - Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

If ; Matthew ? would agree , to : that offer, how much money would he earn?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the number of toy soldiers in each half of Matthew's collection.
since Matthew has a total of 12 unique toy soldiers, half of his collection would be:
{Number of toy soldiers in the first half = 12 / 2 = 6}

Similarly, the number of toy soldiers in the second half would be:
{Number of toy soldiers in the second half = 12 / 2 = 6}

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings from selling the first half of the collection.
Matthew will earn $5 for each toy soldier in the first half, so the total earnings from selling the first half would be:
{Total earnings from the first half = 6 * $5 = $30}

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings from selling the second half of the collection.
Matthew will earn $7 for each toy soldier in the second half, so the total earnings from selling the second half would be:
{Total earnings from the second half = 6 * $7 = $42}

Step 4: Find the total earnings Matthew would receive from the offer.
To find the total earnings Matthew would receive from the offer, we add the earnings from both halves of his collection:
{The final answer is $30 + $42 = $72}
Therefore, Matthew would earn a total of $72 if he accepts the offer.</s>","Half of Matthew collection means 12 * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 toy soldiers.
A buyer wants to buy 6 toy soldiers for $5, so he would pay 6 * 5 = $<<6*5=30>>30 for them.
And for the other half, he wants to pay $7 per toy, which would sum up to 6 * 7 = $<<6*7=42>>42.

Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day, so in 14 days he digs 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

Step 2: Calculate the number of holes filled in by Nate each day.
Nate fills in 9 holes a day.

Step 3: Calculate the number of holes filled in by Nate during a week.
There are 7 days in a week, so Nate can fill in 9 holes/day * 7 days = 63 holes/week.

Step 4: Calculate the number of weeks it takes for Nate to fill in all the holes.
Nate needs to fill in 84 holes, so the number of weeks it takes him is 84 holes / 63 holes/week = 1.33 weeks. Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a week, we'll need to round up and consider it as 2 full weeks and 1 extra day.

{The final answer is 2 weeks and 1 extra day.}</s>","First find the number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation: 14 days * 6 holes/day = <<14*6=84>>84 holes
Then find the net number of holes Nate fill in each day: 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = <<9-6=3>>3 holes/day
Then divide the total number of holes by the daily decrease in the number of holes to find the number of days Nate spends filling in holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days
Then divide the number of days by the number of days per week to convert the answer to weeks: 28 days / 7 days/week = <<28/7=4>>4 weeks

                 [/INST] To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies they have from the total number of cookies they have made.

Given:
Total number of cookies: 7995
Number of rainbow cookies: 2595
Number of oatmeal cookies: 3075

Step 1: Find the number of chocolate chip cookies.
Chocolate chip cookies = Total number of cookies - Number of rainbow cookies - Number of oatmeal cookies
= 7995 - 2595 - 3075

Step 2: Perform the subtraction calculation.
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075

Step 3: Calculate the difference.
Chocolate chip cookies = 2205 - 2595 (Error: Subtraction is backwards)

Chocolate chip cookies = 2325 - 3075
(- 751) + 7995

Step 5: Perform addition and subtraction in correct order.
Chocolate chip cookies = (- 751) + 7995
Chocolate chip cookies = 7919 + 7995

Chocolate chip cookies = 15,914 (Error: The given number is incorrect)

Step 6: Check for error.
We noticed an error in the calculation. The number obtained, 15,914, cannot be correct as it exceeds the total number of cookies made. Therefore, we need to check the given data for accuracy before performing the calculations.

In total, the number , of items ? Igor had ; placed on ; the ; lab bench : was 29.  How many beakers did Igor : lose?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to prepare for an experiment, asking for 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.
2. Igor gathered:
   - 8 test tubes instead of 16
   - 7 beakers (correct)
   - 16 Petri dishes instead of 14
3. Igor placed a total of 29 items on the lab bench.

Let's figure out how many beakers Igor had, both the ones gathered correctly and the ones lost.

1. Igor picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7.
2. So, the number of beakers Igor placed on the lab bench is 7.
3. The total number of items on the lab bench is 29.

Let's find out how many beakers Igor lost:

Number of beakers Igor lost = Total number of beakers on the lab bench - Number of beakers Igor correctly gathered

Number of beakers Igor lost = 7 (on lab bench) - 7 (correctly gathered)

Number of beakers Igor lost = 0

However, we know that Igor picked up 2 fewer Petri dishes than requested. Since there were 16 Petri dishes requested and 14 were gathered, this means that 2 items Igor picked up were not Petri dishes, but beakers. Hence, Igor effectively picked up 9 beakers (7 requested + 2 incorrect).

Since the total number of items on the lab bench is 29, while Igor placed 7 beakers, 8 test tubes (instead of 16), and 16 Petri dishes, we can now determine the number of beakers Igor lost by subtracting the number of beakers already accounted for on the lab bench from the number of beakers Igor gathered:

Number of beakers Igor lost = Number of beakers Igor requested - Number of beakers on the lab bench
Number of beakers Igor lost = 7 (requested) - 7 (on lab bench) = 0

However, we forgot to take into account that Igor picked up 2 extra items. Since those extra items were beakers, not Petri dishes, and since Igor thought he picked up the correct number of Petri dishes (14 instead of 16), we must conclude that:

Number of beakers Igor lost = 2

Therefore, the final answer is: Igor lost 2 beakers.</s>","On the lab bench, there were half of the requested number of test tubes, or 16/2=<<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.
On the lab bench, there were 14+2=<<14+2=16>>16 Petri dishes.
Since the remaining items on the bench were beakers, there were 29-8-16=<<29-8-16=5>>5 beakers on the lab bench.
Thus, Igor lost 7-5=<<7-5=2>>2 beakers.

1. Each table has 4 legs.
2. Each leg requires 2 screws.
3. Therefore, each table requires 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 screws.
4. James is putting together 4 tables.
5. So, James will use a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 screws.
6. James has 40 screws.
7. To find out how many screws he has left over, we subtract the number of screws he used from the total number of screws he had.
8. The final answer is: 40 - 32 = <<40-32=8>>8 screws. Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over.</s>","Each table will take 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 screws

- There are 10 eggs in the first basket
- The second basket has eggs that are in twos more than the first basket

Step 2: Find out how many eggs are in the second basket
- Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as follows:
- Eggs in second basket = 2 * Eggs in first basket
- Substituting the value of eggs in the first basket (10), we get:
- Eggs in second basket = 2 * 10 = 20

Step 3: Find the total number of eggs in both baskets
- To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we simply add the number of eggs in each basket:
- Total number of eggs = Eggs in first basket + Eggs in second basket
- Substituting the values, we get:
- Total number of eggs = 10 + 20

Step 4: Determine the final answer

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We know that Aaron can run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron in a single mile.
2. Vanessa ran 4 miles, so Aaron ran 2 miles [(since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa ran 4 miles)].
3. We're given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
4. Let's first find out Aaron's running speed. Since Aaron can run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we can say that Aaron runs one mile in the time it takes Vanessa to run one mile. Let's denote Vanessa's miles per hour (mph) as V.
5. Using given information, we have Aaron's miles per hour as 2V.
6. Now, let's find out how long it takes Vanessa to run one mile. Since Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron in one mile, we know Aaron's speed is half of Vanessa's.
7. Therefore, it takes Vanessa one mile in [2*(given time Aaron took for 1 mile)/1] minutes.
8. Substituting the value of Aaron's speed (2V) in the above equation, we get Vanessa's miles per hour as 4A.
9. Given that Aaron completed his part of the race (2 miles) in 16 minutes, we have: 2*(16/60) = 1/3 hours or 20 minutes for one mile (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
10. Now, we can find the time it takes Vanessa to complete her 4 miles: 4 miles / (4A/60) minutes = 15 *(2A) minutes = 30A minutes.

{The final answer is 30A minutes.}</s>","Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 miles.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the cost price of each watermelon.
The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price of one watermelon is:

Cost price of one watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
Cost price of one watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price of one watermelon = $1.6

Step 2: Find the selling price of each watermelon.
The vendor sold all the watermelons at a profit of 25%. So, the selling price of one watermelon is:

Selling price of one watermelon = Cost price * (1 + Profit percentage)
Selling price of one watermelon = $1.6 * (1 + 0.25)
Selling price of one watermelon = $1.6 * 1.25
Selling price of one watermelon = $2

Step 3: Check the answer.
Let's make sure that the profit percent is correct.
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = $2 - $1.6
Profit = $0.4
Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) * 100%
Profit percentage = ($0.4 / $1.6) * 100%
Profit percentage ≈ 25%

The final answer is: Each watermelon was sold for $2.</s>","The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.
So, he was able to sell them all for $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.

1. John had a son, James, when he was 19 years old.
2. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who is turning 12 in 3 years.
3. John also has another son who was born when John was 32 years old.

Let's find the age of Dora first:

Dora is turning 12 in 3 years. So, her current age = 12 + 3 = <15>.

Let's find the age of James:
James is twice as old as Dora. So, James' age = 2 * (Dora's age) = 2 * (15) = <30>.

Since James was born when John was 19, we can find John's age when James was born by subtracting James' age from John's current age:
John's age when James was born = John's current age - James' age = 19 + 30 = <49>.

Now let's find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:
John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old, so his current age = 32 + 3 = <35>.

{The final answer is: John's youngest son will be 35 years old in 3 years.}</s>","Dora is 12-3=<<12-3=9>>9

3. They both start peeling oranges from the same basket at the same time.
4. We want to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour.

First, let's calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so she peels 60 minutes / 3 minutes = 20 oranges in an hour.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so she peels 60 minutes / 4 minutes = 15 oranges in an hour.

Now, let's find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour.

Ana peels 20 oranges, and Jane peels 15 oranges. The difference is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

{The final answer is: Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.}</s>","There are 60 minutes in an hour. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes so she will peel 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 oranges in an hour
Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes so she will peel 60/4 = <<60/4=15>>15 oranges in an hour
Ana will have peeled 20-15 = <<20-15=5>>5 more oranges

                    Mark's : car breaks down and he needs to ; get a : new . radiator. ;  The cost . for a new radiator is $400 but he goes ! to ; get it at ! a junk ! shop and gets , it ! for , 80% off.  . He then hires a mechanic to install it and ; it takes 3 , hours . at $50 an hour.  How , much did he pay?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Mark buys a new radiator for 80% off the original price. The original price is $400. {80% of $400 = $400 * 0.8 = $320} So Mark pays $320 for the new radiator.

Step 2: Mark hires a mechanic to install the new radiator. The mechanic charges $50 an hour and it takes 3 hours to install. {3 hours * $50/hour = $150}

Step 3: Add the cost of the new radiator and the installation fee to find the total amount Mark paid. {$320 for the radiator + $150 for the installation = $470}

{The final answer is: Mark paid $470}</s>","The discount on the radiator was 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320
So he paid 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80
The mechanic charges 3*50=$<<3*50=150>>150
So in total he paid 80+150=$<<80+150=230>>230

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Farmer Brown ! has 20 . animals on his farm, ! all either chickens or ; cows. ; They have a total of 70 legs, all together. . How many of . the animals ? are chickens?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as K. We are given that C + K = 20 (the total number of animals) and that each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs. The total number of legs is given as 70.

We can set up two equations to represent this information:

1) C + K = 20
2) 2C + 4K = 70

To solve for C and K, we first need to get rid of one of the variables. We can do this by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + 4K) - (C + K) = 70 - 20

This simplifies to:

2C + 4K - C - K = 50

Combining like terms:

C + 3K = 50

Now, we can set K in terms of C: K = (C-50)/3

However, since K and C are non-negative integers, and K is always less than C, this equation doesn't yield valid solutions for this problem. This equation can be checked by substituting valid integer values for C, like C = 10, which results in a negative value for K, and thus invalid.

Instead, we can solve for C directly from the first equation:

C = 20 - K

Now, we can substitute this expression for C into the second equation:

2(20 - K) + 4K = 70

Expanding and simplifying:

40 - 2K + 4K = 70

2K = 30

K = 15

So, there are 15 cows. Therefore, the number of chickens is:

C = 20 - K = 20 - 15 = 5

Thus, there are 5 chickens on the farm.

{The final answer is: 5 chickens}</s>","Let C be the number of chickens.
There are 20-C cows.
The cows have 4*(20-C) legs.
The cows have 2C legs.
The total number of legs is 2C+4(20-C)=70.
2C+80-4C=70
2C=10
C=<<5=5>>5

                 [/INST] Step 1: Henry and 3 of his friends order a total of 7 pizzas.

Step 2: Each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So the total number of slices is: 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Step 3: Henry and his 3 friends want to share the pizzas equally. This means that the number of slices each of them can have is the total number of slices divided by the number of people.

So the number of slices each of them can have is: 56 slices / (Henry + 3 friends) = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

Therefore, {The final answer is 14 slices each}.</s>","There are 7*8=<<7*8=56>>56 slices in total.
There are 1+3=<<1+3=4>>4 people in total.
They can each have 56/4=<<56/4=14>>14 slices.
