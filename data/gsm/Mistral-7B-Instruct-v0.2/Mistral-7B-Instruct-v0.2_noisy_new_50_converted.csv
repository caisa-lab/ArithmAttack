                    . Janet’s ? ducks lay ! 16 . eggs per . day. She eats : three for : breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for . her , friends every : day with . four. She sells ! the remainder at the , farmers' : market . daily ! for $2 ! per ! fresh ! duck , egg. How . much ! in dollars ; does she : make every day : at the ; farmers' market?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Janet's ducks lay a total of 16 eggs per day.

Step 2: Janet uses three eggs for breakfast every day, so she uses 3 eggs × 1 egg/day = <<3*1=3>>3 eggs/day from her eggs.

Step 3: Janet bakes muffins for her friends with 4 eggs/day. So, 4 eggs/day are used for baking muffins.

Step 4: To find the number of eggs Janet sells at the farmers' market every day, we have the total number of eggs she lays minus the number she uses for her own consumption and muffin baking: Total eggs = 16 eggs/day. Eggs used for Janet's consumption = 3 eggs/day + 4 eggs/day = <<3+4=7>>7 eggs/day. Remaining eggs for sale = 16 eggs/day - 7 eggs/day = <<16-7=9>>9 eggs/day.

Step 5: The price Janet receives for each egg at the farmers' market is $2/egg. To calculate her daily earnings, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: Daily earnings = 9 eggs/day × $2/egg = $<<9*2=18>>18.

{The final answer is $18 in dollars that Janet makes every day at the farmers' market.}</s>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Interpret the problem
The problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. We need to find out how many bolts in total the robe requires.

Step 2: Find the number of bolts for blue fiber
The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. So, the number of bolts for blue fiber is 2.

Step 3: Find the number of bolts for white fiber
The problem states that the amount of white fiber is half that of blue fiber. Therefore, the number of bolts for white fiber is half of the number of bolts for blue fiber, which is 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt.

Step 4: Find the total number of bolts
We have determined that the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber. Thus, the total number of bolts required is 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts.

{The final answer is: 3 bolts}.</s>","It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs for Josh.
Total cost = Cost of house + Repairs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

Step 2: Find out the initial value of the house before repairs.
Initial value = Total cost - Repairs
Initial value = $130,000 - $50,000
Initial value = $80,000

Step 3: Find out how much the value of the house increased after repairs.
The value increased by 150%.
Increased value = Initial value * 1.5
Increased value = $80,000 * 1.5
Increased value = $120,000

Step 4: Calculate the profit made by Josh.
Profit = Increased value - Initial value

Step 1: James runs 3 sprints, each sprint is 60 meters long. That means James runs 3 * 60 = <u>180</u> meters in one session.

Step 2: He runs 180 meters 3 times a week. So, the total distance James runs in a week is 180 * 3 = <u>540</u> meters.

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the amount of feed Wendi gives to her chickens in each meal and find out how much feed she will need for the final meal with 20 chickens.

Wendi feeds her chickens three times a day:
1. In the morning: 15 cups
2. In the afternoon: 25 cups

To find out how much feed Wendi gives to her chickens in one meal, we'll find the average amount of feed she gives per meal:

Average feed per meal = (Total feed per day) / (Number of meals per day)

First, let's calculate the total feed Wendi gives to her chickens per day:
Total feed per day = Morning feed + Afternoon feed
Total feed per day = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Now, let's find the average feed Wendi gives per meal:
 Average feed per meal = Total feed per day / Number of meals per day
 Average feed per meal = 40 cups / 3 meals = 13.33 cups (Approximately, since we know she gives a multiple of 3 cups in each meal)

However, since Wendi gives a multiple of 3 cups in each meal, we can assume that she gives 12 cups in the morning meal and adjusts the amount in the afternoon to make up for the difference, which is 2 cups. So, the actual average feed per meal is 12 + 2 = 14 cups.

Now, to find out how much feed she needs for the final meal of the day for 20 chickens, we can use the average feed per meal (14 cups) and multiply it by the number of chickens (20).

Total feed needed for the final meal = Average feed per meal * Number of chickens

Total feed needed for the final meal = 14 cups * 20 chickens = 280 cups.

{The final answer is: Wendi needs 280 cups of feed for the final meal of the day for her 20 chickens.}</s>","If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.

                    question:
                    . Kylar went to ! the : store to ; buy glasses . for his new apartment. ? One : glass costs : $5, but ? every , second glass costs only ; 60% ! of the ; price. ! Kylar wants to : buy 16 , glasses. How ? much : does he . need to pay . for them?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the price of one regular glass.
One glass costs $5.

Step 2: Determine the price of one discounted glass.
Every second glass costs 60% of the price of one regular glass.
60% of $5 = 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Step 3: Identify how many discounted glasses Kylar wants to buy.
Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, and every other glass is discounted. This means Kylar wants to buy 8 discounted glasses.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the regular glasses.
There are 16 glasses in total, and 8 of them are discounted. This means there are 8 regular glasses. The cost of 8 regular glasses is $5 each, so the total cost for the regular glasses is $8.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the discounted glasses.
The cost of 8 discounted glasses is $3 each, so the total cost for the discounted glasses is $24.

Step 6: Add the cost of the regular glasses and the discounted glasses to find the total cost.
The total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses is the cost of the regular glasses plus the cost of the discounted glasses, which is $8 + $24 = $32.

{The final answer is: $32}</s>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of sheep in Toulouse as x, Charleston as y, and Seattle as z. Based on the given information, we have the following relationships:

x = 2 * y
y = 4 * z

We also know that Seattle has 20 sheep, so z = 20.

Now we need to find the values of x and y and the total number of sheep they have together.

Substituting z = 20 into the second equation, we get:

y = 4 * 20
y = 80

Now we can find x by substituting y into the first equation:

x = 2 * y
x = 2 * 80
x = 160

So Toulouse has 160 sheep, Charleston has 80 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep.

The total number of sheep they have together is:

x + y + z = 160 + 80 + 20 = <<160+80+20=300>>300

{The final answer is 300}</s>","If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

2. He spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

3. He spends the next half-hour (30 minutes) driving at 30 mph.
Additional distance covered = 30 mph * (30 minutes / 60 minutes) = 15 miles

4. For the remaining 3.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph.
Additional distance covered = 80 mph * (3.5 hours) = 280 miles

5. In total, John covers a distance of 180 miles + 15 miles + 280 miles = 475 miles during the 7-hour trip.

6. However, John wanted to get home in 4 hours. So, he still needs to cover the difference in distance between the 475 miles he covered and how far he was initially from home when he started driving.

7. Since John traveled 180 miles in the first 3 hours at 60 mph, then his initial distance from home was 180 miles.

8. The difference in distance between the 475 miles John covered and his initial 180 miles is 295 miles (475 miles - 180 miles).

9. Therefore, John is 295 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours.

{The final answer is: John is 295 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours.}</s>","When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home
He was only able to drive 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours in the first four hours

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find Eliza's hourly rate for the first 40 hours.
We know that Eliza earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours. So, her hourly rate is $10.

Step 2: Calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours this week.
Since Eliza works for 40 hours each week at $10 per hour, her earnings for the first 40 hours are:
Earnings for the first 40 hours = Hourly rate * Hours worked
Earnings for the first 40 hours = $10/hour * 40 hours
Earnings for the first 40 hours = $400

Step 3: Calculate Eliza's overtime hours and earnings.
The number of overtime hours is the difference between the total hours worked this week and the hours worked during regular working hours:
Overtime hours = Total hours worked - Hours for regular hours
Overtime hours = 45 hours - 40 hours
Overtime hours = 5 hours

To calculate Eliza's earnings for overtime hours, we'll use her regular hourly rate multiplied by 1.5 (time and a half) since she earns overtime pay at 1.2 times her regular hourly rate:
Overtime earnings = Hourly rate * Overtime hours * 1.5
Overtime earnings = $10/hour * 5 hours * 1.5
Overtime earnings = $75

Step 4: Calculate Eliza's total earnings for this week.
Total earnings = Earnings for regular hours + Overtime earnings
Total earnings = $400 + $75
Total earnings = $475

{The final answer is: Eliza's earnings for this week, when she worked for 45 hours, are $475.}</s>","Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.

Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.

3. In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30%. So, the number of downloads in the third month was: 180 downloads * 0.7 = 126 downloads

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we just add the number of downloads in each month: 60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366 downloads

                 [/INST] To determine how many years it takes before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate when the annual revenue from selling the lemons will exceed the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree.

Step 1: Calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons
The tree produces 7 lemons each year, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5.
Annual revenue = Number of lemons × Price per lemon
Annual revenue = 7 lemons/year × $1.5/lemon
Annual revenue = $10.5/year

Step 2: Calculate the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree
The annual cost is $3.

Step 3: Determine when annual revenue exceeds annual cost
We need to compare the annual revenue and the annual cost. When the annual revenue is greater than the annual cost, Carlos will start earning money on the lemon tree.

To find out how many years it takes to reach that point, we can set up the following inequality:
$10.5/year > $3/year

Dividing both sides by $1.2 (the difference between the annual revenue and the annual cost):
$10.5/year > $3/year ⇒ ($10.5/year)/($1.2/year) > ($3/year)/($1.2/year)

Simplifying the inequality:
$8.75/year > $2.5/year

Multiplying both sides by $1.2:
$10.5/year > $3/year ⇒ 10.5 > 1.8

Since 10.5 is not greater than 1.8, we cannot find a solution with the given data. In other words, the lemon tree does not generate enough revenue each year to cover its watering and feeding costs, making it an unprofitable investment based on the information provided.

Therefore, there is no answer for the number of years it takes before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.</s>","He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5
He earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5
It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had at the beginning of this sequence ""x"". So, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she sold x/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners in total after the green house.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners she had left after the red house as y. So, she sold y/2 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

4. We know she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house. So, y = 5.

5. Going back to the previous step, we found that y = 5, so she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house. We know she sold y/2 there, so we can find the number of vacuum cleaners she had before the orange house:

     y = 5
     y = 2 * x/2 (since she sold half)
     x/2 = 5/2
     x = 5 * 2 = 10

Therefore, Melanie started with 10 vacuum cleaners.

{The final answer is: Melanie started with 10 vacuum cleaners.}</s>","First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10
Then add two to figure out how many vacuum cleaners she had before visiting the red house: 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12
Now we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18

                 [/INST] To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to find out how many students are enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance first, and then subtract those numbers from the total number of students to find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 students = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

Then, let's find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of the remaining students = 25% of (20 - 4) = 25% of 16 = 4 students

Now, we can find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
The total number of students is 20. We know that 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance and 4 students enrolled in jazz dance. So, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is:
20 students - 4 students (contemporary dance) - 4 students (jazz dance) = 12 students

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can use the following formula:
Percentage = (Number of students in hip-hop dance / Total number of students) * 100%

{The final answer is: 60%}

Note: It seems there is a mistake in the question, as the sum of students enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance is 8, which is 4 more than the total number of students. I assumed there was a mistake in the numbers provided in the question and corrected it to make the problem solvable.</s>","There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.

There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
This is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.

1. Let's calculate the expected profit from the jewelry purchase. Assume the merchant sells the jewelry for the same $5,000 he paid. In this case his profit would be:
   $5,000 (total cost) x 1.025 (market growth rate for jewelry) = $5,125

2. Now let's calculate the expected profit from the electronic gadgets purchase. Assume the merchant sells the gadgets for the same $8,000 he paid. In this case his profit would be:
   $8,000 (total cost) x 1.012 (market growth rate for electronic gadgets) = $8,192

Comparing the expected profits from both options, the merchant's profit would be higher from purchasing the electronic gadgets ($8,192) than from the jewelry ($5,125). Therefore, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets purchase plan to maximize his profit at the end of the month.

{The final answer is: The merchant should purchase electronic gadgets to maximize his profit at the end of the month, and his expected profit would be $8,192.}</s>","If he purchases jewelry, he will make a profit of 2.5% which is $5000*(2.5/100) = $<<5000*(2.5/100)=125>>125

Step 2: Train B also travels 80 miles westward on the first day.

Since they both travel the same distance on the first day and start at the same time, their positions will be the same after the first day.

Step 3: On the second day, they travel 150 miles northwards. This distance is not added to their current positions, as they are traveling in a perpendicular direction to their initial westward direction.

So, the questions asks for the distance covered in two days for each train, not the total distance they have travelled from San Rafael. Therefore, there is no change in their distances since they travel the same distance each day and in a perpendicular direction on the second day.

Answer: Each train covers a distance of 80 miles on both days. {The final answer is: Each train covers 80 miles in each of the two days, resulting in a total distance of 160 miles for each train in two days.) However, the confusion in the wording of the question made it seem like they would cover the distance traveled on the second day along with the distance traveled on the first day, but since they travel in perpendicular directions, their positions remain the same after the second day.</s>","On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.

The combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles
The average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train

1. Claire makes a 3-egg omelette every morning.
2. So, she uses 3 eggs to make 1 omelette.
3. Therefore, the number of eggs she uses in one week is:
   Eggs in one week = Number of omelettes per week * Eggs per omelette
   = 7 days per week * 3 eggs per omelette * 1 omelette per day
   = 21 eggs per week

4. To find out how many eggs she'll eat in a month (4 weeks), we multiply the weekly amount by 4:
   Eggs in 1 month = Eggs per week * Number of weeks
   = 21 eggs per week * 4 weeks
   = 84 eggs

5. Finally, to find out how many dozens of eggs that is, we divide by the number of eggs in a dozen:
   Dozens of eggs in 1 month = Eggs in 1 month / Eggs per dozen

                 [/INST] To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to find out how long it took her to cover the first 6 miles and then calculate the time she needs to cover the remaining distance.

1. Calculation of time taken for the first 4 miles:
Marissa took 1 hour to cover the first 4 miles. So the speed during this part of the hike is: 4 miles / 1 hour = 4 miles per hour.

2. Calculation of time taken for the next 2 miles:
Marissa took another hour to cover the next 2 miles. So the speed during this part of the hike is: 2 miles / 1 hour = 2 miles per hour.

3. Calculation of time taken for the first 6 miles:
Marissa took 1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles. So the total time taken for the first 6 miles is 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.

4. Calculation of the distance of the remaining trail:
The total trail length is 12 miles. Marissa has covered the first 6 miles, so the remaining distance is: 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

5. Calculation of Marissa's required speed for the remaining distance:
Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. Since she has already covered the first 6 miles at different speeds, her speed during the last 6 miles needs to be faster than 4 miles per hour.

The time taken to cover the remaining 6 miles should be less than 1.5 hours (since 4 miles per hour * 1.5 hours = 6 miles). By the formula distance = speed * time, we have 6 miles = x miles per hour * t hours. Solving the equation for 'x', we get x = 6 miles / t.

Since Marissa wants to have more than 4 miles per hour as her speed, let's assume she maintains a speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining distance. We have 6 miles = 5 miles per hour * t hours. Solving for 't', we have t = 6 miles / 5 miles per hour, which equals 1.2 hours.

Marissa needs to cover the remaining 6 miles at a speed greater than 4 miles per hour, so she will aim for 5 miles per hour.

Therefore, there is no need to calculate another speed since Marissa will maintain 5 miles per hour for the last part of her hike.

{The final answer is: Marissa needs to walk at 5 miles per hour for the remaining distance.}</s>","First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours
Next subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour
Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph

                 [/INST] First, let's find the amount of water in each type of drink:

1. Orange drink: 10 liters, two-thirds water
   Water in orange drink = 10 liters * (2/3)
   Water in orange drink = 6.67 liters

2. Pineapple drink: 15 liters, three-fifths water
   Water in pineapple drink = 15 liters * (3/5)
   Water in pineapple drink = 9 liters

Next, let's find the total amount of water before we add the orange drink to the pineapple drink:

Total water before adding = Water in orange drink + Water in pineapple drink
Total water before adding = 6.67 liters + 9 liters
Total water before adding = 15.67 liters

During the process, the question states that one liter of orange drink is spilled. This means that we have 9 liters of orange drink left to be added to the pineapple drink.

Now, let's calculate the total water mixture after adding the remaining orange drink to the pineapple drink:

Total water after adding = Total water before adding + Water in remaining orange drink
Total water after adding = 15.67 liters + 9 liters
Total water after adding = 24.67 liters

Since the question asks for the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to round off the total water after adding to 24 liters.

The final answer is: The total amount of water in 24 liters of the mixed drinks is approximately 24 liters.{Note: All the calculations are based on the given data and the precision of the final calculation may vary slightly due to rounding off earlier in calculations.}</s>","There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.

                 [/INST] To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, let's follow these steps:

1. We know that Raymond is Samantha's cousin and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
2. Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old.
3. Samantha is currently 31 years old.

Now let's find out the age difference between Samantha and Raymond first:

Samantha's age = 31
Raymond's age = Samantha's age - 6
Raymond's age = 25

Next, we need to find out how old Raymond was when he had his son:

Raymond's age when son was born = 23

So, the age difference between Raymond and his son is:

Age difference = Raymond's age when son was born - Raymond's age
Age difference = 23 - 25
Age difference = -2

Since the age difference is negative, it means that the age of the son cannot be correct. Therefore, there must be an error in the information provided. The question states that Raymond is Samantha's cousin and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, but it also states that Raymond had a son when he was 23, which is not possible considering Samantha's current age of 31.

{The final answer is: The information provided is incorrect, and it is not possible to find the answer based on the given data.}</s>","When Raymond's son was born Samantha was 23 - 6 = <<23-6=17>>17 years old.

1. We know that the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour.
2. From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, there are a total of 4 hours between the start and end times.
3. Since the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, the total length it will be shortened during this period is:

Total length shortened = Melting rate per hour × Number of hours

Total length shortened = 2 centimeters/hour × 4 hours

Total length shortened = 8 centimeters

Let's call the original price of the book x. Then, the discount amount is 0.25x (25% of x). Since Kyle paid $19.50 after the discount, we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = $19.50

To solve for x, we can combine like terms:

0.75x = $19.50

Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to find the original price:

x = $19.50 / 0.75
x = $26.67 (rounded to the nearest cent)

So, the original price of the book was $26.67. {The final answer is $26.67.}</s>","Let X be the original price of the book. The discounted price is X - X*25% = $19.50.

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. Milk (5 packs): 5 * $3 = $15
3. Apples (4): 4 * $1.50 = $6
4. Pizza (boxes): Unknown

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all items except pizza:

Total cost of all items except pizza = $12 + $15 + $6 + $50
Total cost of all items except pizza = $73

We know that Marie paid a total of $50. So, the total cost of the pizza boxes she ordered is:

Cost of pizza = Total cost - Total cost of all items except pizza
Cost of pizza = $50 - $73 = -$23

Since the cost cannot be negative, there's an error in the given information. The costs provided do not allow Marie to pay exactly $50 for all the items mentioned in the problem. Therefore, it's impossible to determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered based on the given information.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. First, let's find out how many servings of ice cream Cynthia consumes in 60 days. We know she eats one serving every night, so:
   Servings in 60 days = Servings per night * Number of nights
   Servings in 60 days = 1 serving * 60 nights
   Servings in 60 days = 60 servings

2. Next, let's determine how many cartons of ice cream she needs to buy to have enough servings for 60 days. We know there are 15 servings in one carton, so:
   Number of cartons = Total servings needed / Servings per carton
   Number of cartons = 60 servings / 15 servings per carton
   Number of cartons = 4 cartons

3. Now we can calculate the total amount Cynthia spends on ice cream. We know the cost per carton is $4.00, so:
   Total cost = Cost per carton * Number of cartons
   Total cost = $4.00 per carton * 4 cartons
   Total cost = $16.00

{The final answer is: Cynthia spends a total of $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.}</s>","Each container of ice cream has 15 servings and she eats 1 serving a night so after 60 days she will need 60/15 = 4 containers of ice cream

                 [/INST] To find the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance of the first stop from the total distance of the trip and add the distance of the second stop. Here are the calculations:

1. Henry first stopped after traveling 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.
3. The total distance of Henry's bike trip was 60 miles.

First, let's find the distance of Henry's second stop from the end of the trip:
- Henry stopped 15 miles before the end of the trip.
- Therefore, the distance of his second stop from the start of the trip is 60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles.

Next, let's find the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops:
- Henry traveled 20 miles from the start to his first stop.
- He traveled another 45 miles from his first stop to his second stop.
- Therefore, the total number of miles he traveled between the two stops is 20 miles + 45 miles = 65 miles.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's first find the cost of the two pairs of high heels. We know that one pair costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. So, the cost of both pairs is:

$33 + 2 * $33

Step 2: Simplify the expression above:

$33 + $66 = $99

Step 3: We know that the total cost of the boots and both pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Let's call the cost of the boots ""x"". Therefore, the total cost is:

x + $99 = x + $5

Step 4: Subtract x from both sides of the equation:

$94 = $5

Step 5: There seems to be a mistake in the problem statement as the difference between the total cost of the boots and the high heels and the cost of the boots alone is not equal to $5. Let's assume the cost of the boots is $100 instead for the problem to make sense.

Step 6: Now that the cost of the boots is $100, the total cost is:

$100 + $99 = $199

Step 7: The problem states that this total cost is five dollars less than the cost of the boots alone. But this is not the case since $199 is actually five dollars more than $194, which is the original cost stated for the boots. This inconsistency suggests that there is a mistake in the problem statement.

The final answer is: There seems to be an inconsistency or a mistake in the problem statement, and we cannot determine the cost of the boots based on the given information.</s>","The second pair of heels costs 33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Darrell and Allen's ages now are in a 7:11 ratio. Let's represent Darrell's age as D and Allen's age as A. Since the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11, we can write the equation:

7D = 11A

Step 2: We also know that their total age is 162. So, we can write another equation:

D + A = 162

Step 3: We have two equations with two variables (D and A). To solve the system of equations, we need to eliminate one variable. Let's eliminate D by multiplying the first equation by 11:

7D = 11A
 => 77D = 111A

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation by 7:

D = \frac{11}{7}A

Step 4: To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we first need to find their current ages. Let's find an expression for Darrell's age:

D = \frac{11}{7}A
 => D = \frac{11}{7}(A + 10) {Since we want to find their ages 10 years from now}

Step 5: We know that D + A = 162. Substitute D with its expression we found:

\frac{11}{7}(A + 10) + A = 162

Step 6: To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 7:

11(A + 10) + 7A = 113

Step 7: Now, we can distribute the 11 on the left side of the equation:

11A + 11\*10 + 7A = 113

Step 8: Simplify the equation:

11A + 110 + 7A = 113
 => 18A + 110 = 113

Step 9: Subtract 110 from both sides:

18A = 6

Step 10: Finally, divide both sides by 18 to find Allen's age:

A = \frac{6}{18}
 A = \frac{1}{3}
 A = 1

Since Allen's current age is 1, Darrell's age is given by:

D = \frac{11}{7}(A + 10)
 D = \frac{11}{7}(1 + 10)
 D = \frac{11}{7}(11)
 D = 11 \times 11/7

Using a calculator, we can find the decimal approximation of D, which is approximately 41.34 (rounded to two decimal places).

If we multiply 41.34 by 7 to find Darrell's age, we get an approximation of 290.01. However, since the given information is about ages in whole numbers, it is likely that there is a mistake in the problem or some missing information. Therefore, we cannot give a definitive answer to this problem.

{The final answer is: Based on the given information, Darrell's age is approximately 41.34 (rounded to two decimal places), and Allen's age is 1. However, due to potential errors in the problem or missing information, this answer may not be completely accurate.}</s>","The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18
Since the fraction of the ratio that represents Allen's age is 11/18, Allen's current age is 11/18*162 = <<11/18*162=99>>99
If Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be 99+10 = <<99+10=109>>109 years old

- Gretchen has a certain number of coins.
- There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Step 2: Define variables and set up an equation
- Let's denote the number of silver coins as S.
- Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we have the number of gold coins as G = S + 30.

Step 3: Use the given information to set up an equation
- We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
- Therefore, we have the equation: S + (S + 30) = 110.

Step 4: Solve for S
- First, combine the terms with S: 2S + 30 = 110.
- Next, subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.
- Finally, divide by 2 to find the number of silver coins: S = 40.

Step 5: Find the number of gold coins
- Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we have: G = S + 30.
- Substitute the value of S from step 4: G = 40 + 30.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, the number of jewels Aaron has is:
   Aaron's jewels = half of Raymond's jewels + 5

2. We also know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, the number of jewels Siobhan has is:
   Siobhan's jewels = Aaron's jewels - 2

3. Now we have two equations relating the quantities of jewels that Aaron and Siobhan have to the number of jewels Raymond has:

   a) Aaron's jewels = (1/2) * Raymond's jewels + 5
   b) Siobhan's jewels = Aaron's jewels - 2

4. To solve this system of equations, we can first find the number of jewels Aaron has, then use that result to find the number of jewels Siobhan has.

5. Substitute Raymond's jewels (R) into the first equation:
   Aaron's jewels = (1/2) * R + 5

6. Solve for Aaron's jewels:
   Aaron's jewels = (1/2) * R + 5
   Aaron's jewels = R/2 +5
   Aaron's jewels = (R+10)

7. Use the second equation to find Siobhan's jewels:
   Siobhan's jewels = Aaron's jewels - 2
   Siobhan's jewels = (R+10) - 2
   Siobhan's jewels = R+8

8. Since we're looking for the number of jewels Siobhan has, the final answer is:
   {The final answer is: Siobhan has R+8 jewels}

Given that Raymond has 40 jewels, you can substitute R with 40 to find the number of jewels Siobhan has.

Siobhan's jewels = R+8
Substituting R with 40:
Siobhan's jewels = 40+8
Siobhan's jewels = 48
So, the final answer is: {The final answer is: Siobhan has 48 jewels}</s>","Half of Raymond's jewels is 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20
Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, he has 20+5 = <<5+20=25>>25 jewels.
If Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, he has 25-2 = 23 jewels.

Step 1: Determine how many points Mike scores in each 20-minute interval.
- In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points.

Step 2: Calculate how many points Mike scores in the second 20-minute interval.
- He scores 25% more points in the second interval than in the first.
- First, find the number of points he scored in the first interval: 4 points
- Then, find 25% of that number to determine how many more points he scored in the second interval: 0.25 * 4 = 1 point
- Add that number to the points he scores in the second interval: 4 + 1 = 5 points

Step 3: Determine the total number of points Mike scored.
- He scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes.
- He scored 5 points in the second 20 minutes.
- Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is 4 + 5 = 9 points.

Terry buys 2 yogurts in a day.

Step 2: Determine the price of yogurts during the sale.
Each yogurt costs $2.50 during the sale (since 4 yogurts cost $5.00).

Step 3: Calculate how many yogurts Terry buys in 30 days.
Terry buys 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days he buys 2 * 30 = <<2*30=60>>60 yogurts.

Step 4: Find out how much Terry spends on yogurts during the sale.
Since each yogurt costs $2.50 during the sale, Terry spends 60 * $2.5 = $<<60*2.5=150>>150 during the sale.

Step 5: Since the sale price is a discount, we must find out how much Terry usually spends on 60 yogurts to compare the savings.
First, we find how much 1 yogurt usually costs based on the sale price:  $5.00 / 4 yogurts = $<<5/4=1.25>>1.25 (one yogurt costs $1.25).
Then, we find how much Terry spends on 60 yogurts without the sale: 60 * $1.25.

Step 6: Determine the difference between the cost during the sale and the usual cost for 60 yogurts.
The difference in cost is 60 * $1.25 (usual cost) - $150 (sale cost) = $<<60*1.25-150=112.5>>112.5.

Step 7: The final answer is, Terry spends $150 on yogurts during the sale, and the savings compared to the usual cost for 60 yogurts is $112.5.

13 sets * $15 per set = $195 in total

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the video games John bought. He bought 8 games and each one costs $20:
8 games * $20 per game = $160 in total

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money left from the selling price after buying the video games. We know that John had $5 left:
Total revenue ($195) - Total cost of video games ($160) = $35

Step 4: Check if our calculation in Step 3 is correct. We know that $195 is the total revenue that John made from selling all his sets. Deducting the cost of video games ($160) should leave him with $35:
$195 - $160 = $35

Step 5: Find out how many sets John still has after selling all of them and using the money to buy the video games. We know that each set was sold for $15 and John had $195 in total, so he sold 13 sets. However, in the problem it says that ""He plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 lego sets and he sells them for $15 each"" indicating that this is the complete selling of all the lego sets. Therefore, John does not have any Lego sets left.

                 [/INST] To find out how fast John runs per hour, we first need to calculate how many miles he runs in one hour on each day, and then find the average miles per hour for all three days. Here are the steps:

1. Find out how many miles John runs in one hour on the first day: He runs 60 miles in 3 days, so he runs 20 miles per day. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours, so:
   Miles per hour (first day) = Miles per day (first day) / Hours per day (first day)
   = 20 miles / 3 hours
   = 6.67 miles per hour (approximately)

2. Find out how many miles John runs in one hour on the other two days: Since he runs half the distance on those days, he runs 10 miles on each of them. So, his hourly running speed on the other two days is:
   Miles per hour (other days) = Miles per day (other days) / Hours per day (other days)
   = 10 miles / 3 hours
   = 3.33 miles per hour (approximately)

3. Calculate the average miles per hour for all three days: Since John runs for the same number of hours on each day, we can simply take the arithmetic mean of his hourly running speeds:
   Average miles per hour = (Miles per hour (first day) + Miles per hour (other days)) / 2
   = (6.67 miles per hour + 3.33 miles per hour) / 2
   = 5 miles per hour (approximately)

Therefore, the final answer is: John runs approximately 5 miles per hour.</s>","He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.
He runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.
So for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.
So in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.
So he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.

                 [/INST] To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours when she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we first need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds.

1. Dana can run at a rate of 4 times her walking speed. Let's represent her walking speed as w. Her running speed is 4w.
2. Dana can skip at a rate of half her running speed. So her skipping speed is 0.5 * 4w = 2w.
3. Dana walks at a speed of w. According to the problem, she can skip at 3 miles per hour. We know that:
   distance = speed * time
   So: 3 miles = 2w * time_skipping
   Solving for time_skipping, we find that time_skipping = 1.5 hours
4. To find out how long she spends running and walking in six hours, we need to find the proportions:
   Running time = 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours
   Walking time = 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours
5. Dana's running speed is 4w. So in 2 hours, she covers a distance of 2 * 4w = 8w miles.
6. Her walking speed is w. In 4 hours, she covers a distance of 4w miles.
7. To find the total distance she covers in 6 hours, we add the distances she covers while running and walking: 8w + 4w = 12w miles.

{The final answer is 12w miles}.

Hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. 🤓😊</s>","If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

From the text, we know that when she doesn't hold the gemstone, she can throw the javelin 400 feet. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.

Let's calculate how far she can throw the javelin when she holds the gemstone: 400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet

Now, we need to find out if Polly can still hit the dragon with the javelin if she stands outside the reach of the dragon's flames, which have a range of 1000 feet.

The problem states that Polly can hit the dragon with the javelin when she doesn't hold the gemstone (400 feet throw), so it's safe to assume that the dragon's head or body is closer than 1000 feet away from where Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone.

Therefore, Polly can stand beyond the reach of the dragon's flames (1000 feet) and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin if she throws it from a distance greater than her maximum reach when holding the gemstone (1200 feet).

{The final answer is: Polly can stand beyond the reach of the dragon's flames (1000 feet) and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when she throws it from a distance greater than her maximum reach with the gemstone (1200 feet).}</s>","With the gemstone, Polly could throw the javelin 3 times farther than 400 feet, for a distance of 3*400=<<3*400=1200>>1200 feet.

Total pie pieces = 40

Step 2: At the end of the evening, there were 14 pie pieces remaining. To find out how many pie pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pie pieces from the total pie pieces:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of calories in one serving of chips from the nutritional information.
- According to the nutritional info, a serving of chips is 250 calories.

Step 2: Determine the total number of calories in a 300g bag of chips.
- One serving is 250 calories, and there are 5 servings in a 300g bag.
- So, the total number of calories in a 300g bag is 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

Step 3: Determine the number of grams of chips you can eat while staying under your daily calorie target.
- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.
- To calculate how many calories you have left, subtract the number of calories you've consumed from your daily calorie target: 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.
- Now, you need to find out how many grams of chips contain 200 calories.
- Recall that a serving of chips is 250 calories, so you can find the number of grams of chips in a serving by using the ratio 250 calories : 1 serving.
- To find the number of grams of chips that contain 200 calories, you'll set up the proportion: 250 calories : 1 serving :: 200 calories : x grams
- Solve for x: x grams = 200 calories * (1 serving / 250 calories) = 0.796 grams/calorie * 200 calories = 159.2 grams (approximately)

The final answer is: You can eat approximately 159.2 grams of chips to reach your daily calorie target of 2000 calories.</s>","If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat
If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 tapered candles.
2. One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00.
3. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
4. Charlie makes and sells 20 candles.

First, let's calculate the cost of producing one candle:

Cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks = $10.00
Cost per candle = Cost of producing 1 pound of beeswax and wicks / Number of candles made from 1 pound of beeswax
Cost per candle = $10.00 / 10 = $1.00

Next, let's find out the total cost of producing 20 candles:

Cost of producing 20 candles = Cost per candle * Number of candles
Cost of producing 20 candles = $1.00 * 20 = $20.00

Now, let's find out the revenue he earns from selling 20 candles:

Revenue = Selling price * Number of candles sold
Revenue = $2.00 * 20 = $40.00

Lastly, let's find out the net profit:

Net profit = Revenue - Cost of producing candles
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

{The final answer is: $20.00}</s>","1 pound of beeswax and the wick make 10 candles and he wants to make 20 candles so he needs 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 pounds of beeswax
1 pound of beeswax costs $10.00 and he needs 2 pounds so his supplies will cost 10*2 = $<<10*2=20.00>>20.00
He wants to sell each candle for $2.00 each and he's selling 20 candles so that's 2*20 = $<<2*20=40.00>>40.00
If he makes $40.00 selling candles and his supplies cost $20.00 then his net profit is 40-20 = $<<40-20=20.00>>20.00

- On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 3 * 2 = << 5*2/5 = 6 >> 6 articles (twice the number of articles on Monday)
- On Wednesday, she wrote 2 * 6 = 12 articles (twice the number of articles on Tuesday)

Step 2: Calculate the time spent on each article and the total time spent on articles for each day.
- The time it takes to write an article is an average of 4 hours.
- The total time spent writing articles on each day is the number of articles multiplied by the time it takes to write one article.
- On Monday: 5 articles * 4 hours/article = 20 hours
- On Tuesday: 6 articles * 4 hours/article = 24 hours
- On Wednesday: 12 articles * 4 hours/article = 48 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles in the three days.
Total hours = Monday hours + Tuesday hours + Wednesday hours
Total hours = 20 hours + 24 hours + 48 hours = 82 hours.

{The final answer is 82 hours}</s>","If she wrote five articles on Monday, then on Tuesday she wrote 2/5* 5 = 2 more articles.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many Post-it notes Candice had before purchasing more.
Before she left her house, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

Step 2: Find out how many Post-it notes she used at work.
She used one Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, so she used 220 notes in total at work.

Step 3: Calculate how many Post-it notes Candice had after using those at work.
Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work from the initial number she had: 80 - 220 = -140

This result doesn't make sense, as it indicates she had fewer Post-it notes than she actually started with. However, we found an error in the problem: She can't have had -140 notes, so something must be incorrect.

To solve this, let's check the information given for any potential errors and go back through it methodically.

We'll assume there's an error in the number of Post-it notes used at the coffee shop: 220. Since it doesn't seem possible for Candice to end up with fewer Post-it notes than she started with, it's more likely that there is an error in the number of notes used at the coffee shop.

Let's try to find the correct number of Post-it notes Candice purchased at the store:

Step 4: Calculate how many additional Post-it notes Candice bought at the store.
Let x be the number of Post-it notes in the package she bought at the store.
So, the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after purchasing more would be 80 + x.
The problem tells us that she had 23 notes remaining after buying a package. Plug these values into the equation and solve for x:

80 + x = 23 + 80 (add the initial number of notes with the remaining number and solve for x)
x = 53

So, the final answer is {Candice purchased a package of 53 Post-it notes at the store}.</s>","Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.
Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.
And if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23
Subtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of blue ties John bought as x. Then, he bought twice as many red ties, so the number of red ties is 2x. We're given that the cost of each blue tie is $40, so the cost of blue ties is 40x.

The problem states that the cost of red ties is 50% more than the cost of blue ties, so the cost of red ties is 1.5 times the cost of blue ties. We can express the cost of red ties as 1.5 * 40x = 60x.

The total cost of all ties is the sum of the cost of blue ties and the cost of red ties:

Total cost = Cost of blue ties + Cost of red ties
           = 40x + 60x
           = 100x

We know that John spent $200 on blue ties, so:

40x = $200
x = $200 / $40
x = 5

So John bought 5 sets of blue ties. Since he bought twice as many red ties, John bought 2 * 5 = 10 sets of red ties.

Now we can calculate the total cost of all ties:

Total cost = 100x
          = 100 * 5
          = $500

Therefore, {The final answer is: John spent $500 on ties.}</s>","He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties
So he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties
Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties

                 [/INST] To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained from the 4-foot long wire, which was cut into 6-inch long pieces, we need to perform the following calculations:

1. First, let's determine how many 6-inch long pieces can be made from a single 4-foot long piece. We know that there are 12 inches in a foot, so a 4-foot long piece contains 4 * 12 = 48 inches. Since there are 6 inches in a 6-inch long piece, we can calculate the number of 6-inch long pieces from the total length of the wire:
   Number of 6-inch long pieces = Total length / Length per piece
   Number of 6-inch long pieces = 48 inches / 6 inches

2. To obtain the whole number of pieces, we'll round down the quotient obtained in the previous step:
   Number of pieces = Quotient (rounded down)
   Number of pieces = 48 / 6 ≈ 8
   Number of pieces = 7

So, Tracy obtained 7 pieces of wire, each 6 inches long, from the 4-foot long piece. {The final answer is: Tracy obtained 7 pieces of wire, each 6 inches long.}</s>","If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.

1. We know that the apartment building has 15 floors.
2. Each floor contains 8 units, so the total number of units in the building is: Number of units = Floors * Units per floor = 15 * 8 = 120
3. Three-quarters of the building is occupied, which means that one-quarter of the building is unoccupied. So, the number of unoccupied units is: Number of unoccupied units = Total number of units * (1/4) = 120 * (1/4) = 30

{The final answer is 30 unoccupied units}</s>","The total number of units in the building will be 8 units/floor * 15 floors = <<8*15=120>>120 units.

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs sold per day in dozens.
Since Lloyd sells eggs in dozens and there are 12 eggs in a dozen:
Number of dozens sold per day = Number of eggs produced per day / Number of eggs per dozen
Number of dozens sold per day = 252 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 21 dozens

Step 3: Calculate the revenue Lloyd generates per day from selling eggs.
Revenue per day = Price per dozen * Number of dozens sold per day
Revenue per day = $2/dozen * 21 dozens = $42

Step 4: Calculate the revenue Lloyd generates per week from selling eggs.

                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many comic books Uriah needs to remove to reach the goal of removing 15 pounds from his bag. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of comic books to remove = Target weight / Weight of one comic book
Number of comic books to remove = 15 pounds / 1/4 pound/comic book

Calculation: 15 * 4 = 60 pounds total weight of comic books
Number of comic books to remove = 60 pounds / 1/4 pound/comic book = 240 comic books

Now that we know Uriah needs to remove 240 comic books, let's find out how many toys he needs to remove to reach the target weight of 15 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can calculate this as follows:

Weight of toys to remove = Target weight
Weight of toys to remove = 15 pounds

Number of toys to remove = Weight of toys to remove / Weight of one toy
Number of toys to remove = 15 pounds / 1/2 pound/toy = 30 toys

Therefore, {Uriah needs to remove 30 toys to meet the target weight of removing 15 pounds from his bag} after removing 240 comic books.</s>","30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5

- Number of car tires repaired: 4
- Fee for each car tire: $40
- Revenue from car tire repairs on Thursday: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue earned on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday:
- Number of truck tires repaired: 0 (none)
- Fee for each truck tire: $60
- Revenue from truck tire repairs on Friday: 0 * $60 = $0
- Number of car tires repaired: 12
- Fee for each car tire: $40
- Revenue from car tire repairs on Friday: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue earned on Friday: $0 + $480 = $480

Step 2: Compare the revenue earned on Thursday and Friday.

Total revenue on Thursday: $520
Total revenue on Friday: $480

Step 3: Find the difference in revenue earned between Thursday and Friday.

Difference in revenue = Total revenue on Thursday - Total revenue on Friday

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the number of kittens the Doubtfire sisters were driving home from the animal shelter. The problem states that they were traveling with 7 adopted kittens.

Step 2: Determine the number of kittens born to each of the Doubtfire house cats. We know that Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens the sisters had, while Trixie had 12. Let's find out how many kittens Patchy had first:

- Patchy had three times the number of adopted kittens (7), so Patchy's kittens = 3 * 7 = 21
- Trixie had 12 kittens

Step 3: Add the number of kittens the sisters had adopted from the animal shelter and the number of kittens born to the Doubtfire house cats to find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has:

- Total number of kittens = Adopted kittens + Patchy's kittens + Trixie's kittens
- Total number of kittens = 7 + 21 + 12

Step 4: Calculate the final answer:

The final answer is: 30 kittens.</s>","Patchy has just had 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 kittens
Since Trixie's kittens are 12, both cats have 21 +12 = <<21+12=33>>33 kittens.
Combining the adopted kittens with those from the two cats, the Doubtfire family now has 7 + 33 = <<7+33=40>>40 kittens.

                 [/INST] To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we first need to calculate the weight of the truck and the boxes when fully loaded.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of the truck and driver:
Weight of an empty truck = 0 pounds (given)
Weight of the driver = 3755 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the weight of boxes when fully loaded:
Number of boxes = ?
Weight of each box = 15 pounds

Weight of all boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of one box

Step 3: Find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck:
Total weight of truck, driver, and boxes = Weight of truck + Weight of driver + Weight of all boxes

The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. Therefore,

5000 pounds (bridge weight limit) >= Weight of truck + Weight of driver + Weight of all boxes

Step 4: Set up the inequality:
5000 pounds >= 0 pounds (weight of truck) + 3755 pounds (weight of driver) + (Number of boxes * 15 pounds (weight of each box))

Step 5: Solve for the number of boxes:
5000 pounds >= 3755 pounds + Number of boxes * 15 pounds
Number of boxes <= (5000 pounds - 3755 pounds) / 15 pounds

Number of boxes <= 3408 / 15
Number of boxes <= 227.2 (approximately, which is not a whole number)

Since we cannot have a fractional number of boxes, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 227. It is essential that the driver and empty truck also weigh less than the bridge's capacity to ensure safety. {The final answer is 227}.</s>","The boxes can weigh up to 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = <<5000-3755=1245>>1245 pounds in total.

x = $40.00

Step 2: The delivery vendor added a 25% service fee to Stephen's order. This amount is 0.25 multiplied by the cost of Stephen's groceries.
Service fee = 0.25 * x

Step 3: Delivery fees were charged, costing Stephen an additional $3.00.

Step 2: We also know that there are 67 individual fruits scattered across the bush. So, the number of raspberries in the individual fruits is:
 Individual fruits = Number of individual fruits

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of oranges that are bad and unripe.
- We know that there is 1 bad orange and 20% of the oranges are unripe.
- To find the number of unripe oranges, we need to find 20% of the total number of oranges.
- Oranges = Total number of oranges
Oranges = 25
- Percent of unripe oranges = 20%
Unripe oranges = (Percent of unripe oranges * Total number of oranges) / 100
Unripe oranges = (20 * 25) / 100
Unripe oranges = 5
- Since there is 1 bad orange, we need to add it to the number of unripe oranges.
Total number of bad and unripe oranges = Bad oranges + Unripe oranges
Total number of bad and unripe oranges = 1 + 5
Total number of bad and unripe oranges = 6

Step 2: Find the number of good oranges.
- Subtract the number of bad and unripe oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges.
Good oranges = Total number of oranges - Number of bad and unripe oranges
Good oranges = 25 - 6
Good oranges = 19

The final answer is: There are 19 good oranges in the basket.</s>","20% of 25 oranges is (20/100)*25 = <<(20/100)*25=5>>5 oranges

The problem states that Janet paid $500 for the material. Therefore, the cost of the material is $500.

Step 2: Find the cost of having it made.
The problem states that Janet paid an additional $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch. Therefore, the cost of having it made is $800.

Step 3: Find the total cost before insurance.
The total cost before insurance is the sum of the cost of the material and the cost of having it made.

Total cost before insurance = Cost of material + Cost of construction
Total cost before insurance = $500 + $800
Total cost before insurance = $1300

Step 4: Find the cost of insurance.
The problem states that Janet paid 10% of the total cost before insurance for insurance. Therefore, the cost of insurance is 10% of $1300.

Cost of insurance = 0.1 * Total cost before insurance
Cost of insurance = 0.1 * $1300
Cost of insurance = $130

Step 5: Find the total cost.
The total cost is the sum of the total cost before insurance and the cost of insurance.

                 [/INST] To determine Marcy's pension after 30 years of service, we need to consider the two parts of her pension: the initial annual pension and the percentage of the pension value she becomes entitled to after 20 years.

Step 1: Calculate the initial annual pension after 40 years of service.
Marcy has been working for 40 years, and she currently receives an annual pension of $50,000.
{The initial annual pension is $50,000.}

Step 2: Determine the percentage of the pension value Marcy is entitled to after 20 years of additional service.
After 20 years of additional service, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the pension value per year.

Step 3: Calculate the annual increase in pension value due to the entitlement.
To find the annual increase, we need to know the current pension value (which is $50,000). Then we can calculate 5% of the current pension value, which represents the annual increase.

Annual increase = 5% of $50,000
Annual increase = 0.05 * $50,000
Annual increase = $2,500

Step 4: Determine the pension value after 30 years of service.
To find the pension value after 30 years of service, we need to find the pension value after adding 10 years (from age 50 to 60) of earning the annual increase of $2,500.

Using the formula for the future value of a series of payments (PMT, I/Yr, FV, n, PV), where PMT is the annual payment, I/Yr is the interest rate, FV is the future value, n is the number of periods, and PV is the present value:

FV = PV x (1 + I/Yr) ^ n

Using the pension value ($50,000) as the present value, the annual increase as the payment, 5% as the interest rate, and 10 years as the number of periods, we can calculate the pension value after 30 years of service:

FV = $50,000 x (1 + 0.05) ^ 10
FV = $50,000 x (1.05) ^ 10
FV = $50,000 x 1.61051
FV = $80,525.50

So, the pension value after 30 years of service is approximately $80,525.50.

Step 5: Determine the annual pension after 30 years of service.
To find the annual pension, we can divide the pension value by the expected lifespan or the number of years until retirement:

Annual pension = Pension value / Years until retirement
Assuming a lifespan of 20 years:
Annual pension = $80,525.50 / 20
Annual pension = $4,026.28 per month
Annual pension = $48,315.36 per year

{The final answer is $48,315.36 per year.}</s>","First find how many years Marcy works after 20 years: 30 years - 20 years = <<30-20=10>>10 years

Then multiply that percentage by the total amount of the full pension to find how much she gets: $50,000 * 50% = $<<50000*50*.01=25000>>25,000

Monthly charge = $140

Step 2: Calculate the total charge for one half of the year. Since there are 6 months in a half year, the total charge for the first half is:
Total charge for first half = Monthly charge * Number of months in first half
Total charge for first half = $140 * 6

Step 3: Calculate the total charge for the second half of the year. Since there are also 6 months in a half year, the total charge for the second half is:
Total charge for second half = Monthly charge * Number of months in second half
Total charge for second half = $140 * 6

Step 4: Find the total charge for the second half of the year after the 10% discount. Discounted charge = Total charge for second half * (1 - Discount rate)
Discounted charge = $140 * 6 * (1 - 0.1)

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of miles driven since last fill-up.
Sophia has traveled 100 miles since the last filling.

Step 2: Find the number of gallons used since last fill-up.
Sophia added 4 gallons of gas to her tank last time. So the number of gallons used since last fill-up is 100 miles (distance traveled) ÷ 25 miles per gallon (average fuel efficiency) + 4 gallons (added gallons) = ≈34 gallons

Step 3: Find the number of miles that can be driven with one gallon of gas.
The car's owner's manual states that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. So the car can drive 12 gallons × Miles per gallon = 12 gallons × 25 miles/gallon = 300 miles on a full tank.

Step 4: Find the number of miles that can be driven on a single tank of gas.
To find the number of miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we can use the number of gallons in a full tank and subtract the number of gallons used since the last fill-up.

The final answer is: 300 miles (full tank) - 34 gallons (used since last fill-up) × 25 miles/gallon = ≈228 miles (miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas)</s>","To find miles per gallon divide 100 miles / 4 gallons = <<100/4=25>>25 miles per gallon
To find how far Olivia can go on a single tank, multiply 25 miles per gallon x 12 gallons = <<25*12=300>>300 miles

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find out how long Jim spends on TV and reading in one week.

1. He spends 2 ! hours (which translates to 2! * 60 minutes = 720 minutes) watching TV.
2. He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he spends 720 minutes * 0.5 = 360 minutes (or 6 hours) reading.
3. He does this 3 times a week, so his weekly total is 720 minutes (TV) + 360 minutes (reading) = 1080 minutes (or 18 hours).

Step 2: Now, let's find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks.

1. In 4 weeks, he spends 18 hours * 4 = 72 hours on TV.
2. He also spends 72 hours reading.

{The final answer is}: Jim spends a total of 144 hours (or 72 hours on TV + 72 hours reading) on TV and reading in 4 weeks.</s>","He reads for 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 hour a night

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. Each school has:
   - A girls' basketball team with 5 players = 5 girls per team
   - A boys' basketball team with 5 players = 5 boys per team
   - A coach for the girls' team = 1 coach (for girls)
   - A coach for the boys' team = 1 coach (for boys)

2. So, the number of people sent by each school is:
   - Girls' team: 5 players + 1 coach = 6 people
   - Boys' team: 5 players + 1 coach = 6 people
   - Therefore, each school sends a total of: 6 (girls) + 6 (boys) = 12 people

3. Since there are 4 schools in total, the number of people sent by all the schools is:
   - People per school: 12
   - Number of schools: 4
   - Total number of people: 12 (people per school) * 4 (schools) = 48 people

{The final answer is 48 people}</s>","Each school has sent 1 girls’ basketball team + 1 boys’ basketball team = <<1+1=2>>2 teams.
So each school has sent 2 teams * 5 players per team = <<2*5=10>>10 players.

In total, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = <<10+2=12>>12 people.
Therefore, the schools have sent a total of 12 people per school * 4 schools = <<12*4=48>>48 people.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We have identified that there are three types of gems in the treasure chest: diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.

Step 2: We know that there were 175 diamonds in the chest.

Step 3: We also know that there were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So we need to find the number of rubies, which is:

Rubies = Diamonds - 35

Step 4: We know that there were twice the number of emeralds as the rubies, so the number of emeralds is:

Emeralds = 2 × (Rubies)

Step 5: Substitute the expression for rubies from Step 3 into the equation for emeralds:

Emeralds = 2 × (Diamonds - 35)

Step 6: Now we have the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. We can calculate the total number of gems in the chest by summing these quantities:

Total gems = Diamonds + Rubies + Emeralds
          = (175) + [(175) - 35] + [2 × (175 - 35)]
          = 175 + 140 + 300

                 [/INST] To find the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school, we first need to determine the number of boys and then calculate the number of teachers based on the given student-teacher ratio.

Step 1:
Given that there are 60 girls at the school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can find the number of boys as follows:

Boys = Boys per girl * Girls
Boys = 2 * Girls
Boys = 2 * 60
Boys = 120

Step 2:
Now, we have the number of boys and girls, which is 120 boys and 60 girls. In total, there are 180 students.

Step 3:
Given that there are 5 students per teacher, we need to find the number of teachers at the school by dividing the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

Teachers = Total students / Students per teacher
Teachers = 180 / 5
Teachers = 36

{The final answer is: There are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.}</s>","There are twice as many boys as girls, so if there are 60 girls, there are 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 boys

- Each cell phone costs $150.
- Sheila bought five cell phones.

Total cost = Number of cell phones * Cost per cell phone
Total cost = 5 * $150
Total cost = $750

Step 2: Calculate the interest on each cell phone.
- Each cell phone costs $150.
- A 2% interest rate will be charged.

Interest per cell phone = Cost per cell phone * Interest rate
Interest per cell phone = $150 * 0.02
Interest per cell phone = $3

Total cost with interest = Number of cell phones * Cost per cell phone with interest
Total cost with interest = 5 * $153
Total cost with interest = $765

Step 5: Divide the total cost with interest by the number of months (3 months) to find the monthly payment.

                 [/INST] Let's first find out the square footage of each level in the given sandcastle.

Since each level has half the square footage as the level below it, we can find the square footage of each level by using the following formula:

Level i square footage = Level 1 square footage / 2^(i-1)

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, let's find the square footage of the first level:

First level square footage = 16 / 2^(1-1) = 16 / 2^0 = 16

Now, let's find the square footage of the other levels:

Second level square footage = 16 / 2^(2-1) = 16 / 2 = 8

Third level square footage = 16 / 2^(3-1) = 16 / 4 = 4

Assuming there is a fourth level, the calculation would be:

Fourth level square footage = 16 / 2^(4-1) = 16 / 16 = 1

However, from the given question, it seems that there is a mistake as the top level has a square footage of 16, but based on the given condition, every level above the first should have half the square footage, thus no level should have a square footage of 16.

If we assume the top level has a different square footage, let's call it 'x'. Then, we can use the condition and find the square footage of the other levels as follows:

Level 1 square footage = x

Level 2 square footage = x / 2

Level 3 square footage = x / 2^2 = x / 4

Level 4 square footage = x / 2^3 = x / 8

We're asked to find the average square footage of a level. However, given that the information about the top-level square footage is incorrect and confusing, we cannot accurately determine the answer based on the given information.

To summarize:

Without a valid assumption for the top level's square footage, we cannot determine the average square footage of a level. The question itself contains conflicting information. Therefore, the question lacks a clear answer and requires additional information or correction.</s>","Level 3 is 32 square feet because 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32
Level 2 is 64 square feet because 32 x 2 = <<32*2=64>>64
Level 1 is 128 square feet because 64 x 2 = <<64*2=128>>128
The four levels total to 240 square feet because 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = <<128+64+32+16=240>>240
The average square footage of a level is 60 because 240 / 4 = <<240/4=60>>60

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the amount of dog food Cecilia needs for the first 180 days and the rest of the puppy's life.

For the first 180 days: Cecilia has to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day, so she will need:
180 days * 1 cup/day = <ins>180 cups</ins>

For the rest of its life: Cecilia will have to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day, so she will need:
[Total amount of dog food for the entire life] = [Amount of dog food for the first 180 days] + [Amount of dog food for the rest of its life]
Total amount of dog food = 180 cups (for the first 180 days) + ?

To find the amount of dog food for the rest of its life, we know that the puppy will eat 2 cups per day after the first 180 days. We don't have the information about how long the puppy will live, so let's represent the rest of its life in number of days: let's call this 'x'.

So, the amount of dog food for the rest of its life is x days * 2 cups/day.

Step 2: Determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year.

We know that one bag of dog food contains 110 cups. We want to find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia needs for both the first 180 days and the rest of its life.

Let's start by finding the number of bags needed for the first 180 days:
180 cups / 110 cups/bag = <ins>1.64 bags</ins>
Since Cecilia can't buy a fraction of a bag, she will buy 2 bags instead.

Now, let's find the number of bags needed for the rest of its life (x days):
x days * 2 cups/day / 110 cups/bag = x/(110/2) = x*((1/2)/(110/110)) = x*(1/11) = x/11 bags

So, Cecilia will need 1 bag for the first 180 days, and x/11 bags (where x is the number of days for the rest of its life) for the rest of its life. To find the total number of bags she needs in the first year, we can add these together:

Total number of bags = 1 bag (first 180 days) + x/11 bags (rest of its life)

Calculating this final term depends on knowing the length of 'x' (i.e., the rest of the puppy's life) in days. Once we have that information, we can easily calculate the total number of bags needed for the first year.

{The final answer is: The total number of bags Cecilia needs in the first year depends on the number of days 'x' in the rest of the puppy's life.}</s>","The number of cups of dog food given for the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = <<180*1=180>>180 cups
The number of days left in the year is 365 - 180 = <<365-180=185>>185
The number of cups of dog food given for the rest of the first year is 185 * 2 = <<185*2=370>>370 cups
The total number of cups given in the first year is 180 + 370 = <<180+370=550>>550 cups
The number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = <<550/110=5>>5 bags

1. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so we'll represent the amount of laundry David does as X. Sarah does 4 times that amount, so she does 4X.
2. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so he does half of her amount, which is 0.5 * 4X = 2X.
3. We're given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. So, Sarah does 4X = 400.
4. Now we need to find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. That would be the difference between 2X (laundry Raymond does) and X (laundry David does).
5. Hence, the difference in the amount of laundry they do is 2X - X = X.

{The final answer is X pounds of laundry difference between what Raymond and David do.}</s>","If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does 1/2*400 = 200 pounds of laundry.
Sara also does 4 times as much laundry as David, meaning David does 400/4 = <<400/4=100>>100 pounds of laundry.
The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200-100 = <<200-100=100>>100 pounds

                 [/INST] To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we first need to calculate the number of packages and the cost of buying flowers at each price.

1. Buying flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50:
   - Number of flowers in one package: 3
   - Cost of one package: $2.50
   - Cost of 18 flowers: 18 * $2.50 = $45

2. Buying flowers in packages of 2 for $1:
   - Number of flowers in one package: 2
   - Cost of one package: $1
   - Cost of 18 flowers: 18 * $1 = $18

Now we can calculate the savings by comparing the cost of buying flowers at each price:

Savings = Cost of buying flowers at the less favorable price - Cost of buying flowers at the better price

Savings = $45 (cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price) - $18 (cost of buying 18 flowers at the less favorable price)

Savings = $27

So, Vincent saves $27 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

{The final answer is $27.}</s>","Find how many packages of 3 would be needed which is 18 ÷ 3 = <<18/3=6>>6.

Step 2: Identify the unknown variable and calculate it using given information.
The grooming cost before discount is given as $100. We need to find the discounted amount. Since the groomer offers a 30% discount, we calculate the discounted amount as follows:

Discounted Amount = Original Amount - (Discount Percentage * Original Amount)
Discounted Amount = $100 - (0.3 * $100)
Discounted Amount = $100 - ($30)
Discounted Amount = $70

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 24 liters of water.
2. Two girls each got 1/6 of the water. So, together they got: 2 * (1/6) = 1/3 of the water.
3. This leaves: 24 - (1/3) = 23/3 liters of water.
4. A boy then got 6 liters of water.
5. So, the amount of water left is: 23/3 - 6.

To find out how many liters of water were left, we have to subtract the amount of water that the boy took from the amount of water left after the girls had their share.

Step 5 calculation:
23/3 - 6 = (23 - 18)/3 = 5/3 liters.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is 5/3 liters}.</s>","Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.
So the two girls got a total of 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 liters.
Thus, a total of 8 + 6 = <<8+6=14>>14 liters of water were gotten by the two girls and the boy.
Therefore, 24 - 14 = <<24-14=10>>10 liters of water were left.

                 [/INST] To find out how many games the football team won, we need to subtract the number of losses from the total number of games played.

1. We know that the team played 22 games in total.
2. We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost.

To calculate the number of wins, let's denote the number of losses as L. Then, we have the following equation:

Number of wins = Number of games played - Number of losses

We know that the number of losses is less than the total number of games played by 8. So, we can write:

L < 22
L = 22 - 8 - X

where X is the number of additional games they won beyond just winning the number of games required to make up for their losses (i.e., X > 0).

Since L is less than 22, we can calculate the minimum number of losses by setting L = 0 and solving for X:

X = 22 - 8 = 14

So, the minimum number of games they won is 14 + 8 = 22 (games played). However, we know that they won more than this minimum number, so X > 0.

Therefore, the team won a final total of 22 + X games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, we can set up the following equation:

W = (Number of wins) = 22 + X
L = (Number of losses) = 22 - X
W = L + 8

Substituting the expression for L from the second equation into the third equation, we get:

(22 + X) = (22 - X) + 8

Solving for X, we find that:

X = 16

So, the team won a total of 22 + 16 = 38 games. However, since the question originally stated that the team played 22 games, it appears that there may be some inconsistencies or errors in the information given. Thus, it is not possible to definitively determine the exact number of wins based on the given information alone.

{The final answer is not readily given; the information provided appears to be inconsistent.}</s>","Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.

The , company , has ; a policy of increasing , the : salaries of , each ? of ! its employees by 10% of the , initial ? salary every ! year : for , those who've stayed ; in , the company for five , years. ; If Sylvie just clocked ? 5 years ? in the . company . last , December, what's . her annual : salary after three ? more years ? of ! service?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Sylvie has completed 5 years of service in the company. According to the company's policy, she has received a salary increase of 10% after every year of service. So, we need to find out her current salary.

Step 2: Sylvie started working in the company 5 years ago, and she receives a base salary of $600 per month. Since she has received one salary increase of 10% after every year, we'll calculate her annual salary after 5 years of service.

Year 1: Salary = base salary * (1 + 0.1) = $600 * (1 + 0.1) = $660
Year 2: Salary = $660 * (1 + 0.1) = $726.40
Year 3: Salary = $726.40 * (1 + 0.1) = $801.04
Year 4: Salary = $801.04 * (1 + 0.1) = $878.14
Year 5: Salary = $878.14 * (1 + 0.1) = $960.95

So her current annual salary is $960.95

Step 3: Sylvie is now entering her 8th year of service, and the company will give her another salary increase of 10% after this year.

Salary after 6 years = $960.95 * (1 + 0.1) = $1,057.05

Since Sylvie just clocked 5 years in the company last December, she has completed only 2 full years of service with the salary increase after the first 5 years. The remaining 3 years consist of one year she's already completed, and two more years.

Step 4: So if Sylvie continues to receive a 10% salary increase every year, her salary after three more years of service would be calculated as:

Annual salary after 5 years = $960.95
Annual salary after 6 years = $1,057.05
Annual salary after 8 years = $1,152.86 (given by the calculation in the previous step)
Annual salary after 10 years = $1,261.32

She has already received a salary increase in December, so she is now in the 10th year, but we want to find her salary in the 11th year. Therefore, we need to calculate the salary increase for the 11th year:

Salary increase = annual salary after 10 years * (1 + 0.1)
Salary increase = $1,261.32 * (1 + 0.1)
Salary increase = $1,377.06

Annual salary after 11 years is the sum of her annual salary after 10 years and her salary increase for the 11th year:

Annual salary after 11 years = $1,261.32 + $1,377.06
Annual salary after 11 years = $2,638.38

Step 5: We need to find Sylvie's monthly salary after 11 years of service to determine her total annual salary. To do this, divide her annual salary by 12.

Monthly salary after 11 years = $2,638.38 ÷ 12 ≈ $219.86

{The final answer is her monthly salary of approximately $219.86 in the 11th year of service.}</s>","In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.
Sylvie earnings will increase by 10/100 * $7200/year = $<<10/100*7200=720>>720/year after 5 years.
In three years, the total increase in her salary will be 3 years * $720/year = $<<3*720=2160>>2160
After three years, Sylvie will be paid $7200 + $2160 = $<<7200+2160=9360>>9360

                 [/INST] To find the number of copies Harald sold, we first need to determine how many copies Marilyn sold. We know that Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's record, and that they sold a total of 88,000 copies combined.

Let's represent the number of copies Harald sold as X. Then Marilyn sold 10X copies. The total number of copies sold was X + 10X = 11X. We're given that they sold 88,000 copies, so we have the equation: 11X = 88,000

To find X, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 11: X = 88,000 / 11 ≈ 7,913

Since X represents the number of copies Harald sold, this calculation shows that Harald sold approximately 7,913 copies of his record.

{The final answer is: Harald sold approximately 7,913 copies.}</s>","Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000
Combining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000
Dividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000

Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we need to find 3/4 of the invited guests:
Number of guests who will attend = Invited guests * 3/4
Number of guests who will attend = 16 * 3/4
Number of guests who will attend = 12

Step 2: Determine how many gift bags are needed.
Each guest receives a gift bag, so we need one gift bag per guest:
Number of gift bags needed = Number of guests
Number of gift bags needed = 12

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.
Each gift bag costs $2:
Total cost of gift bags = Number of gift bags needed * Cost per gift bag
Total cost of gift bags = 12 * $2
Total cost of gift bags = $24

- An adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- A child eats half as much as an adult, so a child eats 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of potato salad required for adults.
- There will be 20 adults at the picnic.
- Each adult requires 10 lbs of potato salad.
- So, Ted needs to bring 10 lbs/adult * 20 adults = 200 lbs of potato salad for the adults.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of potato salad required for children.
- There will be 5 children at the picnic.
- Each child requires 5 lbs of potato salad.
- So, Ted needs to bring 5 lbs/child * 5 children = 25 lbs of potato salad for the children.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of potato salad required for the picnic.
- Ted needs to bring 200 lbs of potato salad for the adults.
- Ted needs to bring 25 lbs of potato salad for the children.

1. We know that Jan has three times the number of pets that Marcia has. Let x be the number of pets Marcia has, then Jan has 3x pets.
2. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. Cindy has 4 pets, so Marcia has x = 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the age of Jackson as X. According to the problem, we know that:

1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy's age is X + 5.
2. Jackson is 2 years younger than Corey.
3. Corey is 1 year younger than James, and James is 10 years old.

So we have:

1. Corey's age is X + 2 + 1 = X + 3.
2. James's age is 10.

Now we want to find Jackson's age, but we only have two equations with three variables. To find Jackson's age, we need to eliminate one variable. We can use the fact that Amy's age is X + 5 and that she is older than Jackson:

1. Amy's age (X + 5) > Jackson's age (X).

Therefore, X + 5 > X. Subtracting X from both sides, we get X + 5 > X + X. Simplifying, we have X > X + (-1). Rearranging, we get X > -1.

Since Jackson's age is a positive number, we know that X must be a positive number as well. Now let's try to find X algebraically:

Using the information given, we have:

1. Jackson (X) is 2 years younger than Corey (X + 3), so X = X + 3 - 2.
2. Solving for X, we get X = X + 3 - 2 -> X = X + 1.
3. However, we also know that X < 5 (since Amy is at least 5 years older than Jackson).

To fulfill both conditions, we can use the fact that X is an integer and try values of X starting from 1:

1. If X = 1, then Corey's age would be 1 + 3 = 4, which is not possible since Corey's age is given as being greater than James' age (10).
2. Trying the next possible value, X = 2, leads us to Corey's age being 2 + 3 = 5. This satisfies the condition that Corey is older than James.
3. With this value of X, Jackson is 2 years younger than Corey, which makes Jackson's age X - 2 = 0. However, since Jackson's age must be positive, X cannot be 0, so this solution doesn't work.
4. Trying the next possible value, X = 3, leads us to Corey's age being 3 + 3 = 6. This also satisfies the condition that Corey is older than James.
5. With this value of X, Jackson is 2 years younger than Corey, which makes Jackson's age X - 2 = 1. This is a valid solution.

Therefore, Jackson is 1 year old.

However, this solution seems counterintuitive, as it requires Jackson to be younger than Amy. To check if our solution is correct, let's verify the other given conditions:

1. Amy (X + 5) is older than Corey (X + 3), so X + 5 > X + 3.
2. Subtracting X from both sides, we get X + 5 > X + 3 -> X > -2.
3. Since X is an integer, the smallest valid value for X would be 1 (X = 1 and Corey's age would be X + 3 = 4), but we saw above that this value does not satisfy the condition that Corey is older than James (since James is 10 and 4 < 10).
4. The next valid value for X is X = 2 (Corey's age would be X + 3 = 5), and this satisfies the condition that Corey is older than James (since James is 10 and 5 < 10).

With this validation, we can conclude that Jackson is indeed 1 year old.

{The final answer is Jackson is 1 year old.}</s>","James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = <<10+1=11>>11 years old
Amy is 2 years younger than Corey so is 11 - 2 = 9 years old
Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = <<9-5=4>>4 years old

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's determine the time difference between Lee and Gerald when they originally ran the 400-meter hurdles. According to the problem, Lee was able to run two seconds faster than Gerald.

Step 2: Let's represent the original Gerald's time as ""g."" Since Lee was two seconds faster, Lee's original time was ""g + 2 seconds.""

Step 3: The problem states that Gerald changed his diet and improved his speed by 10%. Let's calculate Gerald's new speed in terms of his original speed. If Gerald's original speed was ""s,"" then his new speed after improving his diet is ""s + 10%.""

Step 4: Now let's find the new time it takes for Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved speed. We know that time is inversely proportional to speed, so if Gerald's original time was g seconds and his new speed is s + 10%, then his new time (Gerald's improved time) is given by the formula: g = s / v, where ""s"" is the length of the 400-meter hurdles race (fixed), and ""v"" is Gerald's original speed. Solving for ""s"" in that equation, we get: s = g * v.

Step 5: Substituting the new Gerald's speed (s + 10%) into the formula above, we get: s = g * (s + 0.1s)

Step 6: Simplifying the equation above, we get: s = g / (1 - 0.1)

Step 7: Solving for ""g,"" we get: g = s / (1 + 0.1) = 0.9 * s

Step 8: Since Lee was two seconds faster than Gerald originally, and now Gerald has improved his speed by 10%, we can set up an equation comparing their performances. The equation is: 0.9s + 2 = 38, where ""s"" represents Gerald's original time in seconds.

Step 9: Solving for ""s,"" we find that Gerald's original time was 39.22 seconds.

Step 10: To find Gerald's improved time, we use the equation g = 0.9s from Step 7. Substituting 39.22 for ""s,"" we get: g = 35.30 seconds.

{The final answer is Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 35.30 seconds with his improved diet.}</s>","If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles, then Gerald initially would run the 400-meter hurdles in 38+2=<<38+2=40>>40 seconds.
10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.
The improved diet reduced Gerald's race time to 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 seconds.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that in the ""a"" neighborhood, the number of rabbit pets is less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Let's denote the number of rabbits as R, the number of dogs as D, and the number of cats as C.
2. We're given that R < D + C and that there are two cats for every dog.
3. We're also given that the number of dogs is 60.
4. Since there are two cats for every dog, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2: C = 2D.
5. We want to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood. So we need to find R + D + C.
6. We can substitute C in terms of D: C = 2D. So the total number of pets is R + D + 2D.
7. Since R < D + C, we know that R < D + 2D.
8. We can look at this inequality visually: R < (D + 2D), or R < 3D.
9. Since R is less than the number of dogs, it must be a relatively small number. We don't have any concrete information about the number of rabbits, but we know that there are fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, and there are two cats for every dog.
10. Based on this information, it's unlikely that there are more than a few rabbits in the neighborhood, perhaps no more than 10.
11. If there are only 5 rabbits, for example, then the inequality becomes 5 < 60 + 2(60), or 5 < 126. This is false, so there must be more rabbits than 5.
12. Let's try 10 rabbits instead: 10 < 60 + 2(60), or 10 < 126. This is true.
13. Therefore, one possible solution is that there are 10 rabbits in the neighborhood.
14. This would mean a total of 70 pets (10 rabbits + 60 dogs), but we have no way of knowing for sure, because we don't have concrete information about the number of rabbits.

3. Therefore, there are 200 - 40 = ↓160↓ girls.
4. 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout group. So, the number of girls in the Girl Scout is 160 x 2/3 = ↓106.67↓. Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll round it to the nearest whole number. So, 107 girls are in the Girl Scout.
5. To find out how many girls are not in the Girl Scout, we subtract the number of girls in the group from the total number of girls: 160 girls - 107 girls = ↓53 girls↓.

                    question:
                    . When ? Freda : cooks canned ! tomatoes , into , sauce, they ; lose half their volume. , Each 16 ounce can ; of : tomatoes : that , she uses contains three tomatoes. Freda’s , last . batch of : tomato . sauce made ; 32 ounces of sauce. How many ; tomatoes . did Freda : use?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many tomatoes are in a 16-ounce can. Since each can contains three tomatoes and there are 16 ounces in a can, we can calculate the number of tomatoes using the given information:

3 tomatoes = 16 ounces
1 tomato = 16 ounces / 3
1 tomato =  approx. 5.33 ounces

Step 2: Calculate the number of tomatoes lost when converting 32 ounces of canned tomatoes into sauce. Since they lose half their volume, we can find the number of tomatoes in the original 32 ounces of sauce:

32 ounces of sauce =  original number of tomatoes
original number of tomatoes * 0.5 = lost tomatoes

Step 3: Add the number of tomatoes in the lost tomatoes to the number of tomatoes in the final sauce to find the total number of tomatoes used:

original number of tomatoes + lost tomatoes = total number of tomatoes
(32 ounces of sauce) * 2 = total number of tomatoes

Step 4: Convert the total number of tomatoes back to the number of cans to check if it matches the expected number of cans used:

total number of tomatoes / number of tomatoes per can = number of cans
(total number of tomatoes from step 3) / 3 = number of cans

If the number of cans matches what was used initially in the process, we can confirm the answer.

{The final answer is the number of tomatoes used in creating 32 ounces of tomato sauce.}

[Note: Unfortunately, without calculating the numbers, it is impossible to know for certain if the final answer matches the number of cans used. The calculation would provide the definitive answer.]</s>","Tomatoes lose half their volume when made into sauce, so Freda started with 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces of tomatoes.
At 16 ounces per can, she used 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 cans of tomatoes.
At 3 tomatoes a can, Freda used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 tomatoes.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem.
- The problem describes a traffic jam on the motorway, with cars lined up.
- Some cars drive through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes.
- More cars drive through the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam.
- Five cars from the line take an exit and don't drive through the traffic jam.
- If there were originally 30 cars on the motorway, how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?

Step 2: Extract the relevant information.
- At least 25 cars (30 original cars - 5 cars that took an exit) drove through the traffic jam.
- Some cars drove through during the first 15 minutes.

Step 3: Reasoning.
- We don't have the exact number of cars that drove through during the first 15 minutes.
- However, we know that more cars drove through during the last 15 minutes (20 cars).
- Since a total of 25 cars drove through the traffic jam, the remaining cars must have passed during the last 15 minutes.

Step 4: Calculate the number of cars that drove through during the first 15 minutes.
- The number of cars that drove through during the last 15 minutes is 20.
- Since a total of 25 cars drove through the traffic jam, the number of cars that drove through during the first 15 minutes must be: 25 total cars - 20 cars in the last 15 minutes = 5 cars

{The final answer is: 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.}</s>","The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
Most of the cars exited in the final 15 minutes so in the first 15 minutes, there must have been 25 total cars – 20 cars that drove through in the final 15 minutes = 5 cars that drove through the traffic jam.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the number of potted plants Mary already has on her window ledges.
Each window ledge has 2 potted plants, and there are 40 window ledges in Mary's home. So, Mary has a total of 40 x 2 = 80 potted plants.

Step 2: Determine the number of potted plants Mary received yesterday.
She received 18 new potted plants.

Step 3: Calculate the number of potted plants Mary will give away to her friends and family.
She will give away 1 plant per ledge, so she will give away 40 plants.

Step 4: Subtract the number of potted plants Mary gave away from the total number of potted plants she had to determine the number of potted plants she will remain with.
80 (potted plants Mary had) - 40 (potted plants Mary gave away) = 40 potted plants

{The final answer is: Mary will remain with 40 potted plants.}</s>","Yesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants

Tomorrow, Mary’s plant giveaway will be 40 *1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.
She will therefore remain with 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants.

Step 2: The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, we need to find 1/4 of the number of rings produced by the first friend:
1/4 * 20 = 5

Step 3: The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the number of rings produced by the third friend is:
60 (rings produced by the fourth friend) + 10 = 70

Step 4: We already know the number of rings produced by the first (20) and second (5) friends. Let's calculate the number of rings produced by the third friend (70). We also know that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. Since the third friend pressed 10 rings more than the fourth friend, we can calculate their rings as:
60 (rings produced by the fourth friend) + 10 = 70

Step 5: To find the total number of doorbell rings, we add the number of rings produced by each friend:
Total rings = 20 (first friend) + 5 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) = 95

{The final answer is 95}</s>","The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, a total of 1/4*20=<<1/4*20=5>>5 times.
Jerome's second friend pressed on the doorbell 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25
The first two friends pressed on the doorbell 25+20=<<25+20=45>>45 times altogether before Jerome could open the door.
Jerome's third friend pressed on the doorbell 60+10=<<60+10=70>>70 times before Jerome could open the door.
Altogether, Jerome's third and fourth friends pressed on the doorbell 70+60=<<70+60=130>>130 times before Jerome could open.

| History     | 15               | 7                       |
| Geography   | 8                | 8                        |

First, let's find out how many pages Solo has left to read in total:

Total Pages to Read = Science: 40 - 4 = 36
                    + Social Studies: 20
                    + History: 15
                    + Geography: 8
                    = 65 pages

Since Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading, let's find out how many pages he needs to read on average per day:

Pages to Read per Day = Total Pages / Number of Days
                        = 65 pages / 5 days
                        = 13 pages per day

However, since it's not possible to read a fraction of a page, Solo will have to read an additional page each day to meet the requirements:

Pages to Read per Day = 13.5 pages/day (rounded up to 14 pages/day)

So, Solo needs to read an average of 14 pages per day to finish all his assigned reading within five days.

{The final answer is: Solo needs to read an average of 14 pages per day.}</s>","Solo has to read a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = <<4+20+7+8=39>>39 pages.

                 [/INST] Step 1: determine the number of glasses John drinks per day for water and soda on weekdays and weekends.
John drinks a glass of water with every meal on weekdays: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day.
On weekdays, he also drinks one glass before going to bed.
So John drinks a total of 4 glasses (3 meals + 1 before bed) of water per weekday.

On weekends, John drinks a soda with dinner instead of water. Since he has dinner three times a day on weekends too, he drinks 3 glasses of soda.
Since he doesn't drink water before bed on weekends, the total number of glasses John drinks on weekends is 3 (breakfast, lunch, and dinner).

Step 2: calculate the total number of glasses of water John drinks per week.
Since John follows this routine every weekday, the total number of glasses of water he drinks per week is:
4 glasses (per weekday) * 5 days (per week) = 20 glasses of water per week.

Final answer: {The final answer is John drinks 20 glasses of water in a week}.</s>","John has 4 glasses of water a day on each of the 5 weekdays, for 4*5= <<4*5=20>>20 glasses.

1. Calculate time it takes to cover 3 miles: 10 minutes
2. Divide the time it takes to cover 3 miles by the number of miles covered in 3 miles to find out how long it takes to cover 1 mile: 10 minutes / 3 miles = 3.33 minutes per mile (approximately)

Now that we know it takes approximately 3.33 minutes to cover one mile of the city, we can calculate how long it takes to cover the entire city, which is 42 miles across:

1. Multiply the number of minutes it takes to cover one mile by the number of miles in the city: 3.33 minutes per mile * 42 miles = 139.26 minutes (approximately)

{The final answer is: It will take approximately 139.26 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.}</s>","The city will be covered in 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 intervals of 10 minutes.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's find out how many pieces Poppy has placed on the board. We know that she has placed a quarter of the pieces:

Quarter of the pieces = Poppy's pieces on the board

Step 2: Let's assume that the total number of pieces in the 1000-piece puzzle is X. Poppy has placed a quarter of the pieces on the board, so we have:

Poppy's pieces on the board = X / 4

Step 3: Now, we know that after Poppy finished placing her quarter of the pieces, her mom placed a third of the remaining pieces. Let's find out how many pieces are left after Poppy placed her quarter:

Remaining pieces = Total pieces - Poppy's pieces

Step 4: We have the total number of pieces as X and Poppy has placed X / 4 pieces. So the remaining pieces are:

Remaining pieces = X - (X / 4)

Step 5: To solve this equation, we need a common denominator for the fractions. In this case, the least common multiple of 4 and 3 is 12. So let's convert the fractions to have a common denominator of 12:

Poppy's pieces = X / 4
Remaining pieces = X - (X / 4)

To convert X / 4 to have a denominator of 12, we need to multiply both the numerator and denominator by 3:

Poppy's pieces = 3X / 12

To convert X - (X / 4) to have a denominator of 12, we need to modify the denominator of (X / 4) to 12 using the following equation: X * (denominator of the fraction we want) = numerator * (denominator of the original fraction):

X * 3 = 4X
X = 4X / 3

Now we can convert X - (X / 4) to have a denominator of 12 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 3:

(X - X / 4) * 3 = (3X / 4) * 3 = 3X

So, the remaining pieces are:

Remaining pieces = X - 3X / 12

Step 6: To simplify the equation, first subtract the fractions:

Remaining pieces = X / 12

So, there are X / 12 pieces left to be placed. Since X is the total number of pieces, we don't have enough information to find an exact value for the remaining pieces. However, we know that the remaining pieces are a twelfth of the total number of pieces. {The final answer is X / 12 pieces left to be placed.}</s>","Poppy has placed 1000 pieces / 4 = <<1000/4=250>>250 pieces.
This means there are 1000 – 250 = <<1000-250=750>>750 pieces remaining.
Her mom therefore places 750 / 3 = <<750/3=250>>250 pieces.
This leaves a total of 750 – 250 = <<750-250=500>>500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

                 [/INST] To find the total inner volume of the three boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of each box, and then add those volumes together.

The dimensions of one box are given as height 5 inches, width 6 inches, and length 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the dimensions of the inner box are:

Height: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch (for the two side walls) = 4 inches
Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 5 inches
Length: 4 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches

So the inner volume of one box is:

Inner Volume = Height * Width * Length
            = 4 inches * 5 inches * 3 inches
            = 60 cubic inches

Since there are three boxes, the total inner volume of all three boxes is:

Total Inner Volume = Inner Volume of One Box * Number of Boxes
                = 60 cubic inches * 3
                = 180 cubic inches

{The final answer is 180 cubic inches}.</s>","The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
So each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width
It also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height
Finally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth
So the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches
So in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches

                 [/INST] To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we first need to determine the total number of hours he watched on that day and then subtract the hours spent on 1-hour episodes.

1. Calculate the hours Frankie watched on each day:
   - Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour (per episode) x 2 episodes x 2 days = 4 hours
   - Wednesday: a few episodes (less than 10, assuming each episode is less than 30 minutes) x 30 minutes x number_of_episodes (to be determined) + 1 hour
   - Thursday: 1 hour (per episode) x 2 episodes = 2 hours
   - Friday: 2 hours (per 1-hour episode) x 2 episodes = 4 hours
   - All days: 4 hours (Monday-Tuesday) + hours_on_Wednesday + 2 hours (Thursday) + 4 hours (Friday)

2. Find the total hours Frankie watched on Wednesday:
   hours_on_Wednesday = hours_ watched _ 30-minute_ episodes _ 30 minutes + 1 hour
   Since the number of episodes is unknown, we cannot directly calculate the hours Frankie watched on Wednesday. However, we do know that he watched 7 hours in total.

3. Calculate the hours watched on Wednesday by solving for the number of 30-minute episodes:
   hours_on_Wednesday = 30 minutes x number_of_episodes + 1 hour
   7 hours = 30 minutes x number_of_episodes + 1 hour
   To find the number of 30-minute episodes, we need to subtract 1 hour from the total hours.
   6 hours = 30 minutes x number_of_episodes
    number_of_episodes ≈ 2 (rounded down since it cannot be a fraction of a episode)

{The final answer is: Frankie watched approximately 2 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.}</s>","Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.
After Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.
After Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.
After Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.
After Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.
Each 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.
Thus, W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.

                    question:
                    Henry ? is making cookies for . a local baking competition. ; He wants , to make twice ; as many ? as he ? did last : year. . When . he finishes , baking, he ; realizes , he . actually baked . 15 , more cookies than , he meant : to. ; He . drops , 5 ! of his cookies as ; he ; is , putting : them out to cool, and now has ; a total of ? 110 ! cookies. : How many . cookies did Henry ? bake last , year?
                 [/INST] To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we need to work backward through the given information. Here are the steps:

1. Henry baked 110 cookies this year.
2. He baked twice as many cookies as he did last year, so:
Henry baked last year = 110 cookies / 2
Henry baked last year = 55 cookies

3. Henry baked 15 more cookies than he meant to this year, so:
Henry meant to bake this year = Henry baked this year - 15
Henry meant to bake this year = 110 cookies - 15
Henry meant to bake this year = 95 cookies

4. Henry wanted to makecookies twice as many as he did last year, so:
Henry baked last year = Henry means to bake this year / 2
Henry baked last year = 95 cookies / 2
Henry baked last year = 47.5 cookies
Since it's not possible to bake half a cookie, we need to adjust our calculation:

5. Since Henry could only bake full batches of cookies, he likely baked an additional batch to reach the intended quantity:
Additional batch = (Henry means to bake this year - Henry baked last year) / 2
Additional batch = (95 cookies - 47 cookies) / 2
Additional batch = 39 / 2
Additional batch = 19.5 ≈ 20 batches
Since Henry couldn't bake a partial batch, he must have baked 20 batches last year instead of 47.
So the final answer is:

{Henry baked last year = 110 cookies / 2 = 55 cookies * 2 = 110 cookies / 2 = 55 batches * 24 cookies/batch = 120 cookies}
(Note that I incorrectly calculated 55 batches * 24 cookies/batch in my initial response. Apologies for the confusion, the correct calculation is 55 batches * 20 cookies/batch = 1100 cookies / 20 = 55 batches.)

The final answer is: {Henry baked last year = 55 batches * 20 cookies/batch = 1100 cookies / 20 = 55 batches}</s>","Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.
He had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.
Therefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of purchasing 10 gallons of gas at the station.
Cost of gas = Price per gallon * Number of gallons
Cost of gas = $3.00/gallon * 10 gallons
Cost of gas = $30.00

Step 2: Calculate the cashback reward.
Cashback reward = Number of gallons * Cashback per gallon
Cashback reward = 10 gallons * $0.20/gallon
Cashback reward = $2.00

Step 3: Subtract the cashback reward from the cost of gas to find the total amount spent.
Total amount spent = Cost of gas - Cashback reward
Total amount spent = $30.00 - $2.00
Total amount spent = $28.00

Step 4: The final answer is: After receiving cashback rewards, someone would spend $28.00 for purchasing 10 gallons of gas at the local gas station.</s>","Gas is $3.00 a gallon and they buy 10 gallons of gas so that's 3*10 = $<<3*10=30.00>>30.00

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the dimensions of each roll-up for Marcell and Beatrice.
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 rolls wide X 14 rolls long = 42 rolls total
Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 rolls wide X 24 rolls long = 48 rolls long (although a mistake was made, we'll use this information in the calculation)

Step 2: Calculate the number of rolls each person consumed if they ate their entire amount.
Marcell: Consumed 42 rolls
Beatrice: (Since her rolls were larger due to the mistake, we need to determine how many of her wider rolls can be found in Marcell's 42 rolls) 
3 rolls (width of Marcell's roll) = 1 width of Beatrice's roll
So, 13.933rolls (length of Marcell's roll) = x rolls (length of Beatrice's roll)
x = 13.933 rolls / 3 rolls ≈ 4.644
This means Beatrice can eat approximately 5 rolls of her size to match Marcell's 42 rolls. So, Beatrice consumed 5 rolls * 2 widths = 10 rolls

Step 3: Calculate the number of rolls they ate on average.
Total number of rolls eaten = Marcell's rolls + Beatrice's rolls
Total number of rolls eaten = 42 rolls (Marcell) + 10 rolls (Beatrice) = 52 rolls

Step 4: Divide the total number of rolls eaten by the number of participants to find the average.
Average number of rolls eaten = Total number of rolls eaten / Number of participants
Average number of rolls eaten = 52 rolls / 2 participants = {26 rolls}

Therefore, the final answer is that on average, they each ate 26 rolls.</s>","Beatrice ate 48 because 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.

                 [/INST] To solve this problem, let's first find out how much water Julia's boat took on per unit distance and time, and then use that information to find out how much water it took on during the whole journey to the shore.

1. First, let's find out how much water the boat took on per unit distance. We are told that the boat took on 2 liters of water every 10 feet while rowing back towards shore. So we can calculate water intake per unit distance as: 2 liters / 10 feet = 0.2 liters/foot.

2. Next, we need to find out how long it took Julia to row 20 feet, and use that information to calculate how much water the boat took on during that distance. We are told that it took 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So we can calculate water intake per unit time as: 0.2 liters/foot * 20 feet = 4 liters. Also, since it took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, the water intake per unit time is 4 liters/16 seconds = 0.25 liters/second.

3. Finally, to find out how much water the boat took on during the whole journey to the shore, we need to know how long it took Julia to row the distance between the leak and the shore. We are told that the shore was 64 seconds away. So the total water intake during the journey is: 0.25 liters/second * 64 seconds = 16 liters.

So, the final answer is: Julia's boat took on 16 liters of water by the time she reached the shore.</s>","It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.
Thus, she had to row 20 * 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 feet back to shore.
In those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.
Thus, the boat had taken on 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

Each teacher uses the whiteboard in each lesson, so each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times per day.

Step 3: Find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in one lesson.
The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

Step 4: Find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day by one teacher.
One teacher cleans the whiteboard 2 times per lesson and has 2 lessons per day, so one teacher cleans the whiteboard 2 x 2 = 4 times per day.

Step 5: Find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day by all teachers.
There are 4 teachers in the classroom, so they clean the whiteboard 4 x 4 = 16 times per day.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as X. Then, Jamal's phone can hold 6X photographs.
2. The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times less than the number of birds in a photograph of ducks at the zoo. Let's assume there are Y birds in the photograph. Then, Brittany's phone can hold MAX(X) = 50/6 * Y photographs.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. So, we have the equation 6X = 1800. Solving for X, we find that X = 300.
4. Brittany's phone can hold MAX(Y) = 50/6 * Y photographs. Substituting X = 300 in the equation, we get MAX(Y) = 166.67 * Y. Since the number of photographs must be an integer, we can round up or down to the nearest integer.
5. Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is equal to the number of ducks in the photograph that Brittany's phone could hold. Since Brittany's phone can hold only 166 ducks (rounded down), there must be at least 167 ducks in Jamal's photograph for it to contain the same number of photographs.

Final answer: At least 167 ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.</s>","Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos, which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone can hold, Brittany's phone can hold `1800/6=<<1800/6=300>>300 photographs.

10x2 boards: 10 boards * 2 inches * 4 feet * $10/board = $200
5x10 boards: 5 boards * 10 inches * 4 feet * $10/board = $200

Step 2: Determine the new cost of leftover 10x2 and 5x10 boards due to the 50% price increase.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We are given the ratio of sugar to water in Katy's coffee as 7:13, meaning 7 parts sugar to 13 parts water.

Step 2: We need to find the number of teaspoons of sugar in one part. Since 1 cup of water equals 16 tablespoons (which is 16 x 6 = 96 teaspoons), we first need to find how many teaspoons are in one part of the 13 part water.

13 parts water = 13 x 96 = 1248 teaspoons

Step 3: Now that we know there are 1248 teaspoons in 13 parts water, we can find how many teaspoons are in one part of the sugar (which is 7 parts).

1 part sugar = 7 parts sugar / 13 parts total = 7/13 of the total amount of sugar

7 parts sugar = (7/13) x 1248 = 460.61 teaspoons ≈ 461 teaspoons

So 1 part sugar is approximately 461 teaspoons.

Step 4: To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used with a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and the same amount of water as before, we need to determine how many parts of sugar that represents.

120 teaspoons of sugar = 120 / 461 ≈ 0.2645 parts sugar

Step 5: Finally, to find the number of teaspoons of sugar that correspond to approximately 0.2645 parts of the sugar, we multiply 0.2645 by the number of teaspoons in one part of sugar.

Number of teaspoons of sugar = 0.2645 x 461 ≈ 119.18 teaspoons ≈ 120 teaspoons

{The final answer is approximately 120 teaspoons of sugar}.</s>","The total ratio representing the ingredients she used to make the coffee is 7+13 = <<7+13=20>>20

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago. Let's call Lylah's salary X. Therefore, Adrien's salary was $1.3 * X (where $1.3 is 1 + 0.3 = 1.3).

Step 2: Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40%, so Adrien was earning $1.404 * X (where $1.404 is 1 + 0.4 = 1.404).

Step 3: We're also given that Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, so Adrien's salary was $40000. We can find Lylah's salary by finding how much less Adrien's salary was four years ago.

Step 4: Since Adrien's salary was $1.3 * X four years ago and $40000 four years earlier, we can set up the equation: $1.3 * X = $40000 + $X.

Step 5: Solving for X, we get: $1.3X = $44000 => X = $44000 / $1.3 ≈ $33846.15. Therefore, Lylah was earning approximately $33846.15 four years ago.

Step 6: Four years later, Lylah's salary had also increased by 40%, so Lylah was earning $1.404 * $33846.15 ≈ $48718.82.

Step 7: Adrien's salary was $1.404 * $33846.15 ≈ $49898.11.

In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000

                 [/INST] To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we first need to find out how many miles she runs during each part of her run.

1. Rosie runs 10 mph for 3 hours:
Miles ran during the first part = Speed * Time

= 30 miles

2. Rosie then runs 5 mph for the remaining time:
We're given that she runs for a total of 7 hours, so she runs 4 hours at 10 mph and the remaining time at 5 mph.
Let's find the time she runs at 5 mph:
0 hours (the first 3 hours are at 10 mph) + Time (in hours) at 5 mph = 7 hours
Time (in hours) at 5 mph = 7 hours - 3 hours

1. The number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is equal to the number of letters she stamped.
2. She put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. So, the number of letters she stamped is one-third of the initial number of letters needing stamps.
3. The initial number of letters needing stamps is 60.
4. To find the number of letters that were originally in the pile of already-stamped letters, we need to find one-third of 60.

                 [/INST] Let's work through this problem step by step:

1. Julia was preparing a dinner party for 12 people, and she intended to serve stew.
2. Julia noticed she was out of plastic spoons.
3. She bought a new package of spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as x.

4. Her husband later bought a new package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.

So, the total number of spoons Julia had when setting the table was:

12 (for the dinner party) + x (from her initial purchase) + 5 (from her husband's purchase)

We know that the total number of spoons was 17, so:

12 + x + 5 = 17
x = 17 - 12 - 5
x = 0

That doesn't make sense in the given context (as you'd end up with fewer spoons than you started with). Let's go back to the initial purchase and assume the package size is a multiple of 12 to avoid fractional calculations.

Let's say Julia bought a package of 13 or 14 spoons initially, which would mean she had a total of 15 or 16 spoons. Since her husband bought a small package of 5 spoons, Julia's spoons count would be:

15 (or 16) + 5 = 20 (or 21)

To satisfy the statement that she had a total of 12 spoons when setting the table, we need to find out how many spoons she used during the cooking process. Since she used three spoons, and we know her table setting had 12 spoons left:

12 + 3 = 15

Therefore, she must have initially bought a package of 15 spoons, which is not a multiple of 12. Let's try the other possibility: 14 spoons. This would make her table setting process have 11 spoons left over:

12 + 3 = 15, 15 + 11 = 26, 26 - 14 = 12

This time, the numbers work. Since she bought a package of 14 spoons and used 3 during cooking, she had a total of 17 spoons when buying the new set but only 12 left when setting the table.

{The final answer is: Julia bought a package of 14 spoons initially}</s>","The total number of spoons from Julia and her husband was 12+3=<<12+3=15>>15 spoons.

We are given that a watermelon costs 3 times what each pepper costs, and an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs. Let's represent the cost of a pepper as x.

From this information, we know that:
- A watermelon costs 3x
- An orange costs 3x - 5

Step 2: Find the cost of 1 orange and 1 watermelon.
To find the cost of 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges, we first need to know the cost of one watermelon and one orange.

- Cost of 1 watermelon: 3x
- Cost of 1 orange: 3x - 5

Step 3: Calculate the cost of 4 watermelons and 10 oranges.

- Cost of 10 oranges: 10 * (3x - 5)

Step 4: Calculate the cost of 20 peppers.
The question states that Dillon is buying 20 peppers, so we need to find the cost of these peppers.

- The cost of each pepper is 15$, so the cost of 20 peppers is 20 * $15 = $300

Step 5: Find the total amount of money spent.
To find the total amount of money spent, we need to add the costs of the watermelons, oranges, and peppers.

- Total cost: 12x + 10 * (3x - 5) + $300

Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of x, we cannot provide a final numerical answer. However, the equation above shows how to calculate the total amount spent based on the cost of each pepper.

{The final answer is: $[12x + 10(3x-5) + 300]$}</s>","A watermelon costs three times what pepper costs, which is 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
An orange price is 45 - 5= $<<45-5=40>>40.
Dillon buys four watermelons at a total cost of 45 * 4 = $<<45*4=180>>180.
He also purchases peppers at a total price of 20 * 15 = $<<20*15=300>>300.
The oranges cost him a total of 10 * 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
He used a total of 400 + 300 + 180 = $<<400+300+180=880>>880.

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many hours the hospital spends seeing patients per day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the average time spent with each patient from minutes to hours.

Next, we'll find out how many hours the hospital spends seeing patients in total per day. Multiply the number of hours spent with each patient by the number of patients seen per day.

Then, we'll calculate the revenue the hospital earns per hour from seeing patients. To do this, multiply the number of patients seen per hour (from the previous step) by the fee the hospital charges per hour.

Finally, we'll calculate the profit the hospital makes per hour by subtracting the cost of having doctors present from the revenue earned per hour.

{The final answer is the profit per hour, multiplied by the number of hours in a day to find the total daily profit.}

Step 1: Average time spent with each patient: 24 minutes
--> Hours spent with each patient: 24 minutes * (1 hour / 60 minutes) = 0.4 hours

Step 2: Total hours spent with patients per day: 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient
--> 200 hours

Step 3: Hourly revenue from patient visits: $200/hour * 500 patients
--> $1,000,000/day / 24 hours
--> $41,666.67/hour

Step 4: Hourly cost of doctors' fees: $150/hour * number_of_doctors
Since the question didn't provide information about the number of doctors, we cannot calculate the exact hourly cost.

Step 5: Profit per hour: Revenue per hour - Cost per hour
--> $41,666.67/hour - Cost_per_hour

{The final answer is $X per hour, where X is the hourly cost of doctors' fees.}

For example, if the hospital spends $105,000 on doctors per day, the hourly cost would be $46,875/hour (assuming 24 hours of operation). The profit per hour would be $24,791.67, and the total daily profit would be around $596,700.

{The final answer is $X per hour and $596,700 daily profit, where X is the hourly cost of doctors' fees.}</s>","The hospital sees patients for 500*24=<<500*24=12000>>12000 minutes a day
That means they see patients for 12000/60=<<12000/60=200>>200 hours a day
They profit 200-150=$<<200-150=50>>50 per hour
So they make a profit of 200 hours * $50/hour = $<<200*50=10000>>10000 a day from patient visits

- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.

Step 2: Calculate the number of tickets Pam used for riding the roller coaster.
- Each roller coaster ride costs 6 tickets.
- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets for roller coaster rides.

Step 3: Calculate the number of tickets Fred used for riding the roller coaster.
- Each roller coaster ride costs 6 tickets.
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets for roller coaster rides.

1. On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
2. On Tuesday, he walked 6 miles for each day that he walked on Monday. Since he walked 4 miles on Monday, he walked 6 miles \*\*x\**\* number of days on Tuesday.

Let x represent the number of days he walked on Tuesday:

3. Total miles he walked on Tuesday = 6 miles/day \*\*x\**\ days: 6x miles

4. The total number of miles he walked from Monday to Wednesday is given as 41 miles.

5. Miles he walked on Monday = 4 miles

6. Miles he walked on Tuesday = 6x miles

7. Therefore, the total number of miles he walked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is: 4 miles + 6x miles

8. We are given that the total number of miles he walked from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles.

9. Setting up the equality: 4 miles + 6x miles = 41 miles

10. Solving for x, we need to get x alone:

6x = 37 miles
x = 37 miles / 6 miles/day
x ≈ 6.2 days

11. However, we know that Walt walked exactly 3 days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), so the value of x cannot be approximate. This means that there is an error in the problem statement, and the total number of miles he walked from Monday to Wednesday cannot be 41 miles, according to the provided information.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how long it took Mark to complete the first test.
Mark completed 75 questions in 1.5 hours (5 questions per hour). So, the time it took Mark to complete the first test is 75 questions ÷ 5 questions per hour = 15 hours.

Step 2: Calculate how many questions Mark was able to answer in the first test.
Mark had 1.5 hours (or 90 minutes) to complete the first test, and he answered 75 questions. Therefore, he was able to answer 75 questions ÷ 1.5 hours = 50 questions per hour.

Step 3: Determine how many questions Mark completed in the first test.
We know that Mark had 1.5 hours (or 90 minutes) to complete 75 questions, so he was able to answer 50 questions per hour. We can then find out how many questions he completed by multiplying the number of hours by the number of questions he can answer per hour: 1.5 hours × 50 questions per hour = 75 questions.

Step 4: Find out how many questions Mark was able to answer in the second test with the given amount of time.
Mark completed 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour, so he completed them in 100 questions ÷ 5 questions per hour = 20 hours.

Step 5: Calculate how many questions Mark answered in total in both tests.
Mark answered 75 questions in the first test and 100 questions in the second test, so he answered a total of 75 + 100 = 175 questions.

Step 6: Determine how many questions Mark left incomplete.
Mark had a total of 8 hours for the first test and 6 hours for the second test, so he had a total of 8 hours + 6 hours = 14 hours to complete both tests. We found that he was able to answer 175 questions in both tests, so we need to find out how many questions were in the tests and subtract the number of questions he answered from that total.
We know that Mark answered 175 questions and there were 75 questions in the first test, so the second test had 100 questions (175 - 75). Since Mark was able to complete the entire second test with the time given, he was able to answer all 100 questions, so there were no unanswered questions in that test.
So, to find out how many questions were left unanswered in both tests, we need to subtract the number of questions Mark answered from the total number of questions in both tests: 75 (first test) + 100 (second test) = 175 questions. However, we already know that Mark answered 175 questions, so there are no unanswered questions in this scenario. {The final answer is: No questions were left incomplete}.</s>","Questions Mark completed in yesterday’s test: 5*8 = <<5*8=40>>40.

                 [/INST] To find out what percentage of the cars are semi-automatic, we first need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. The problem states that there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars
= 20 - 12 - 4
= 4

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we can use the following formula:

% of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100%
= (4 / 20) * 100%
= 20%

Therefore, {The final answer is: 20% of the cars are semi-automatic}.</s>","12 + 4 = <<12+4=16>>16 cars are either automatic or manual.
So, 20 - 16 = <<20-16=4>>4 cars are semi-automatic.
Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 4/20 x 100% = 20%.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. We start with the total number of bees in the hive, which is given as 700.

2. We're told that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. Let's denote the number of worker bees as W and the number of baby bees as B. Then, we have:

W = 2B

3. We're also told that there are twice as many babies as queens. Let's denote the number of queens as Q. Then, we have:

B = 2Q

4. Now, we want to find the number of worker bees. From the first equation, we have W = 2B. Substituting the expression for B from the second equation into the first equation, we get:

W = 2(2Q)

5. Simplifying, we have:

W = 4Q

So there are 4 queen bees for every worker bee, and there are 4 worker bees for every baby bee (from the first equation). Therefore, the total number of worker bees is:

{The final answer is} 700 bees / (4 babies/worker + 1 queen/4 workers) = 175 workers.

This calculation assumes that there is at least one queen, but if there are no queens, then there would be no bees in the hive since the worker bees cannot exist without a queen to begin the colony.</s>","Let x represent the number of queens
Babies:2x
Workers:2(2x)=4x

Workers:4(100)=400 worker bees

1. Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day.
2. So, in one week (7 days), he spends: 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week on video games.

3. Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, so to find out how much money he would earn if he worked instead of playing video games, we multiply the number of hours he spends on video games per week by his hourly wage: 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.

- Light bulbs: $3.00
- Cups: $3.00
- Roach traps: $4.00
Total cost of non-food items = $2.20 + $3.00 + $3.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $15.20

Step 2: Calculate the tax on non-food items.
Tax on non-food items = 10% of $15.20 = 0.10 * $15.20 = $1.52

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of non-food items with tax.
Total cost of non-food items with tax = $15.20 + $1.52 = $16.72

Step 4: Calculate the cost of food items.
- Milk: $2.20
- Eggs: $3.00
Total cost of food items = $2.20 + $3.00 = $5.20

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of all items.
Total cost of all items = Total cost of food items + Total cost of non-food items with tax
Total cost of all items = $5.20 + $16.72 = $21.92

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total expenses for the current and potential clients.
Since Kim has 3 current clients and each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, the total number of bottles and packs needed for the current clients is:
Current clients' bottles: 3 * 2 = 6
Current clients' packs: 3 * 1 = 3
So the total number of bottles and packs for the current and potential clients is:
Total bottles: 6 (from current clients) + 2 * 5 (from potential clients) = 11
Total packs: 3 (from current clients) + 5 (from potential clients) = 8
The cost of a bottle of bleach is $2 and the cost of a pack of cloths is $5.
So, the total expenses for bleach are: 11 * $2 = $22
And the total expenses for cloths are: 8 * $5 = $40
The total expenses for the week are: $22 + $40 = $62

Step 2: Calculate the total income for the week.
The total income for the week is given as $92.

Step 3: Calculate the weekly profit.
Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses.
Weekly profit = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $62 = $30

The final answer is: {Lucas will make a profit of $30 each week}.</s>","Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.
Each week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.
Each week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.
The bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.
The packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.
His profit will therefore be $92 total income - $72 total expenses = $<<92-72=20>>20.

Step 3: John harvests his pineapples every 3 months. Therefore, he harvests 4 times a year because there are 12 months in a year and 3 months between each harvest.
Step 4: To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in one year, we multiply the total number of pineapples he has by the number of harvests in a year: 1000 pineapples * 4 harvests/year = <<1000*4=4000>>4000 pineapples.

1. The first box has 500 pieces.
2. The second box has 3 times the number of pieces in the first box, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
3. The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces in the first box, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now we know that Johnny picked up all the Lego blocks from the floor. So, the total number of pieces he picked up is the sum of the pieces in the three boxes:

Total blocks = Blocks in box 1 + Blocks in box 2 + Blocks in box 3
Total blocks = 500 + 1500 + 125

1. Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. She saw 1/2 of that number (15 bees) return in the next 6 hours.
3. Then, she saw twice as many bees leave the hive in the next 6 hours, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. After that, every bee that left before that hadn't returned yet returned to the hive in the next 6 hours.

We want to find the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours. The total number of bees Debra saw leave the hive in the first 12 hours (2 cycles of 6 hours each) is 30 (first cycle) + 60 (second cycle) = 90 bees.

Since Debra saw half of the bees that left return during the first 6 hours, then during the second 6 hours, the same number of bees also returned. So, 15 bees returned during the second 6 hours, making a total of 30 bees that returned during the entire day.

Now, we know that Debra saw twice as many bees leaving the hive during the third cycle (6 hours) as during the first cycle (30 bees). So, there were 2 * 30 = 60 bees leaving the hive during the third cycle. Since half of these bees had already returned during the second 6 hours, there were still 30 bees that hadn't returned yet. These bees would return during the last 6 hours of the day.

Therefore, the final answer is: {Debra saw 30 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.}</s>","Debra first sees 30 bees leave the hive, then sees 1/2 that many return, 30 x 1/2 = <<30*1/2=15>>15 bees that return and 15 bees that are still away from the hive.

Cost of one adult ticket = $12
Cost of one child ticket = $10

Next, we know that Brittany gave $8 in change after purchasing one adult ticket and one child ticket. We need to find out how much money she gave the cashier in total.

To do this, we can find the cost of one adult ticket and one child ticket and add them together. Then, we can subtract the amount of change Brittany received to find out how much money she gave the cashier.

Cost of one adult ticket = $12
Cost of one child ticket = $10
Total cost = Cost of one adult ticket + Cost of one child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Finally, to find out how much money Brittany gave the cashier, we can subtract the amount of change she received from the total cost of the tickets.

1. Steve's biking speed: 3 miles = 5280 feet ⏤ Steve bikes at 440 feet per minute, so the time it takes him to bike home is: 5280 feet ÷ 440 feet per minute = 12 minutes.
2. Tim's skateboarding speed: 2 miles = 3280 feet ⏤ Tim skateboards at 264 feet per minute, so the time it takes him to skateboard home is: 3280 feet ÷ 264 feet per minute = 12.3 minutes (approximately).

Since Steve bikes faster than Tim's skateboarding speed, Steve will finish first and wait for Tim to arrive. The difference in their travel times is 12 minutes (Steve) vs. 12.3 minutes (Tim). Therefore, the winner (Steve) will wait for the loser (Tim) for approximately 0.3 minutes or 18 seconds before they arrive home.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the cost of inflating one tire for a bicycle.
Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for inflating the tires of a bicycle.
Since there are two tires on a bicycle, the total cost for inflating the tires of one bicycle is 2 x 25 cents = 50 cents.

Step 3: Calculate the revenue generated from inflating the tires of bicycles.
Five people came by bicycle, so the total revenue generated from inflating their tires is 5 x 50 cents = $2.50.

Step 4: Calculate the revenue generated from inflating the tires of tricycles.
Three people came by with tricycles. Since a tricycle has three wheels, the total revenue generated from inflating their tires is 3 x 50 cents x 3 = $4.50.

Step 5: Calculate the revenue generated from inflating the tire of a unicycle.
One person came by with a unicycle. Since a unicycle has one wheel, the revenue generated from inflating its tire is 1 x 25 cents = 25 cents.

Step 6: Calculate the total revenue generated on the first day.
The total revenue generated on the first day is $2.50 (bicycles) + $4.50 (tricycles) + $0.25 (unicycle) = $7.25.

{The final answer is $7.25}.</s>","There were 10 bike tires to fill up because 2 times 5 equals <<2*5=10>>10.
There were 9 tricycle tires to fill up because 3 times 3 equals <<3*3=9>>9.
There was one unicycle tire to fill up because 1 times 1 equals 1.
There were 20 total tires to fill up because 10 plus 9 plus 1 equals <<10+9+1=20>>20.
She made $5 because 20 times .25 equals <<20*.25=5>>5.

Ten packs × Number of cookies per pack = Total number of cookies
10 × 6 = 60 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cookies.
Total number of cookies × Cost per cookie = Total cost
60 × $0.10 = $6

Step 3: Subtract the total cost of the cookies from the $10 bill to find out the change Carl will receive.
Change = $10 - Total cost
$10 - $6 = $4

The final answer is: Carl will receive a change of $4.</s>","A pack of cookies costs 6 x $0.10 = $<<6*0.1=0.60>>0.60.

                 [/INST] To find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it, we need to follow the chain of events and find out how many fries were left after each incident.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries.
The number of fries left = Initial number of fries - Number of fries eaten
Initial number of fries = 14 + Number of fries in the pack

2. A seagull stole half of the fries Dave had left.
Number of fries left after seagull = Initial number of fries left after Dave ate - Number of fries eaten by the seagull
Initial number of fries left after Dave ate = Initial number of fries - 14
Half of the fries were eaten by the seagull, so the number of fries left after the seagull = Initial number of fries left after Dave ate / 2

3. Three pigeons each ate three fries.
Number of fries left after pigeons = Initial number of fries left after the seagull / (1 + 3*3)

4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
Number of fries left after raccoon = Initial number of fries left after pigeons / (1+2/3)

5. An ant carried off one single french fry.
Number of fries left = Initial number of fries left after raccoon - 1

At last, the number of french fries that were initially in the pack when Dave bought it, can be calculated as following:

Initial number of fries = Initial number of fries left after raccoon * (1+3*3+1) / (1/2)

{The final answer is:  Initial number of fries = 83 * 2 = 166 french fries.}</s>","Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.
The 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.
The ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.
The raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.
Thus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
Since he has three 1-hour classes each day, the number of hours on these days is:
3 classes/day * 1 hour/class * 3 days/week = 9 hours/week

Step 2: Calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Since he has two 2-hour classes each day, the number of hours on these days is:
2 classes/day * 2 hours/class * 2 days/week = 8 hours/week

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in one semester.
Since there are 16 weeks in one semester, the total number of hours is:
(hours/week on Mon-Fri) * (weeks/semester) + (hours/week on Tues-Thurs) * (weeks/semester)

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of baked goods.
Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes daily. So the total number of baked goods is: 300 rolls + 120 chocolate croissants + 60 baguettes = 480 baked goods.

Step 2: Convert rolls to inches.
Each roll is 4 inches long. So the total length of rolls is 480 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1920 inches.

Step 3: Convert chocolate croissants to inches.
Each chocolate croissant is 6 inches long. So the total length of chocolate croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.

Step 4: Convert baguettes to inches.
Each baguette is 2 feet long, and 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long. The total length of baguettes is 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches.

Step 5: Calculate the total length of all baked goods.
Total length = length of rolls + length of chocolate croissants + length of baguettes.
Total length = 1920 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches.

Step 6: Simplify the calculation.
Total length = 1920 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 4080 inches.

Step 7: Convert inches to feet.
1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So we have: Total length = 4080 inches / 12 inches/foot = 340 feet.

{The final answer is 340 feet}.</s>","First find the total length of the rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = <<300*4=1200>>1200 inches
Then find the total length of the croissants: 120 rolls * 6 inches/roll = <<120*6=720>>720 inches
Then add the length of the rolls and croissants to find the total length in inches: 1200 inches + 720 inches = <<1200+720=1920>>1920 inches
Then divide the total length by 12 inches per foot to find the length in feet: 1920 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1920/12=160>>160 feet
Then find the total length of the baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = <<60*2=120>>120 feet

- Monkeys need 200 bananas.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas.
- Baboons need 100 bananas.

To find the total number of bananas needed for all apes in one month, we can add their requirements together:

Total bananas needed per month = Monkeys + Gorillas + Baboons
= 200 + 400 + 100
= 700 bananas

Now, we want to find out how many bananas are needed to last for 2 months. Since there are 2 months in 60 days (approximately), we can find the number of bananas needed for that period:

Total bananas needed for 2 months = Total bananas needed per month * Number of months
= 700 bananas * 2 months
= 1,400 bananas

{The final answer is 1,400 bananas}</s>","The total number of bananas the prime apes need every month is 200+400+100= <<200+400+100=700>>700.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the distance run by Blake.
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. This means Blake runs a total of 15 times * 100 yards = <1500 yards>.

Step 2: Calculate the distance run by Kelly.
Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. This means she runs a total of 34 times * (2 * 40 yards) = <1760 yards>.

Step 3: Determine the difference in distance between the two runners.
The difference in distance is the distance that Blake ran minus the distance that Kelly ran = <(1500 yards) - (1760 yards)>.

However, the expression (1500 yards) - (1760 yards) shows that Blake ran a shorter distance than Kelly, which contradicts the problem statement. Let's check for any possible errors in the problem.

Here's a mistake in the problem statement: Blake actually runs longer than Kelly. The corrected calculation will yield a different result.

Step 3 (Corrected): Determine the difference in distance between the two runners.
The difference in distance is the distance that Blake ran minus the distance that Kelly ran = <(1500 yards) - (1760 yards)>.

But since the expression (1500 yards) - (1760 yards) shows that Blake ran a shorter distance than Kelly, let's revisit the problem statement and calculate the true difference in distances:

Step 1 (Revisited): Calculate the distance run by Blake.
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. This means Blake runs a total of 15 times * 100 yards = <1500 yards>.

Step 2: Calculate the distance run by Kelly.
Kelly runs back and forth 14 times (original 15 times, but she ran to the 40-yard line, which is half of the field length) on a 100-yard football field. This means she runs a total of 14 times * 100 yards = <1400 yards>.

Step 3 (Corrected): Determine the difference in distance between the two runners.
The difference in distance is the distance that Blake ran minus the distance that Kelly ran = <(1500 yards) - (1400 yards)>.

Answer: The winner runs <100 yards> farther than the loser. {The final answer is 100 yards.}</s>","Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200
He runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000
Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80

2. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 5 starfish less than Anakin, i.e., Anakin caught X starfish and Locsin caught (X-5) starfish.
3. Locsin caught 3 fewer seahorses than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 3 seahorses less than Anakin, i.e., Anakin caught Y seahorses, and Locsin caught (Y-3) seahorses.
4. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 2 clownfish more than Anakin, i.e., Anakin caught Z clownfish, and Locsin caught (Z+2) clownfish.
5. We need to find the total number of fish (starfish + seahorses + clownfish) that Anakin and Locsin were able to catch.
6. First, let's calculate the number of starfish, seahorses, and clownfish that Anakin caught: Anakin caught 10 starfish, Y seahorses, and Z clownfish.
7. Next, let's calculate the number of starfish, seahorses, and clownfish that Locsin caught: Locsin caught (X-5) starfish, (Y-3) seahorses, and (Z+2) clownfish.
8. Now, we need to add the number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin to find the total number of fish they caught: (10 + X) for starfish, (Y + (Y-3)) for seahorses, and (Z + (Z+2)) for clownfish.
9. Simplifying the equations for each group of fish: For starfish, Anakin caught 10, and Locsin caught X, so the total number of starfish they caught is 10 + X.
10. For seahorses, Anakin caught Y, and Locsin caught (Y-3), so the total number of seahorses they caught is Y + (Y-3) = Y + Y - 3 = 2Y - 3.
11. For clownfish, Anakin caught Z, and Locsin caught (Z+2), so the total number of clownfish they caught is Z + (Z+2) = 2Z+2.
12. To find the total number of fish they caught, we need to add the total number of starfish, seahorses, and clownfish they caught: 10 + X + 2Y - 3 + 2Z+2.

{The final answer is: The total number of fish they caught is 10 + X + 2Y - 3 + 2Z + 2}</s>","Locsin caught 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 starfishes.
They caught 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 starfishes.
Locsin caught 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 seahorses
They caught 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 seahorses
Locsin caught 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 clownfish.
So, they caught 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 clownfish.
Therefore, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 15 + 9 + 8 = <<15+9+8=32>>32 fish.

                    If a : bag ! of marbles . costs $20 and : the ; price : increases by ! 20% of the original : price every , two ! months, how much , would ; a bag of : marbles ! cost , after 36 months?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the cost of a bag of marbles after every two months. We know that the price increases by 20% every two months.

Let's denote the initial cost of a bag of marbles as C. After two months, the cost will be:

C_2 = C + 0.2 * C = 1.2 * C

After four months (two intervals of price increase), the cost will be:

C_4 = C_2 + 0.2 * C_2 = 1.2^2 * C

We can keep calculating the cost after more intervals of two months in the same way:

C_6 = C_4 + 0.2 * C_4 = 1.2^3 * C
C_8 = C_6 + 0.2 * C_6 = 1.2^4 * C
...

Step 2: Calculate the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months. We can write this expression using the initial cost C:

C_36 = C_34 + 0.2 * C_34 = 1.2^17 * C

Step 3: Find the final cost. We know that the initial cost is $20 (C = $20):

C_36 = 1.2^17 * $20

To find the value of 1.2^17, we can use a calculator or a spreadsheet program. The result is approximately $233.42.

So, the final answer is: {The final cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $233.42}.</s>","When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4
If the price increases after every two months, in 36 months, it will increase 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 times.
If each increase is $4, the total amount the price of the bag of marbles will have increased by after 36 months is 18*$4 = $<<18*4=72>>72
After the total increase of the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, the total cost will be $20+$72 = $<<20+72=92>>92

Step 1: Identify the number of each type of toy and their respective costs.
- There are 5 red cars, and each red car costs $4.
- There are 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5.
- There is one doll, but we don't have its cost.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of red cars and action figures.
- The total cost of red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.
- The total cost of action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Step 3: Determine the cost of the doll (since it was missing in the question).
Since the total cost of red cars and action figures is $20 + $15 = $35, and the total cost of red cars, action figures, and the doll should be $35 + cost_of_doll = $40, the cost of the doll must be $40 - $35 = $5.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all toys.
The total cost of all toys (red cars, action figures, and doll) is $20 + $15 + $5 = $40.

                 [/INST] To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we first need to calculate the cost of her time and the cost of hiring an accountant.

1. The cost of Jackie's time:
She loses 3 hours of freelance work at a rate of $35/hour.
Cost = (Number of hours) x (Rate per hour)
Cost = 3 hours x $35/hour
Cost = $105

2. The cost of hiring an accountant:
The accountant charges $90.

3. Comparison of costs:
Let's compare the cost of Jackie doing her taxes herself (lost income) and the cost of hiring an accountant.

If Jackie hires an accountant, she will spend $90, but if she does her taxes herself, she loses $105 in income from the three hours of freelance work she cannot do.

4. Conclusion:
Since $105 (the cost of doing her taxes herself) is greater than $90 (the cost of hiring an accountant), Jackie will save $15 by hiring an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself. {The final answer is: She will save $15 by hiring an accountant.}</s>","First find the total lost revenue if Jackie does her taxes herself: $35/hour * 3 hours = $<<35*3=105>>105

1. For one Spanish flan, Sandra needs 3 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits.
3. To make 1 Spanish flan, Sandra needs 3 eggs, so she needs to babysit _______ times to make ______ Spanish flans.

First, let's find out how many Spanish flans Sandra can make with the eggs her neighbor gives her during one babysitting session:

4. Number of Spanish flans made from one babysitting session = Number of eggs given / Number of eggs needed for one Spanish flan
5. Number of Spanish flans made from one babysitting session = 9 / 3
6. Number of Spanish flans made from one babysitting session = 3

                 [/INST] Let's denote Brooke's age as x. Then, Seth's age is 2 x (since he is twice as old as Brooke).

Now we are given that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So, we can write an equation: x + 2 (years for Brooke) + 2x + 2 (years for Seth) = 28.

Solving this quadratic equation:
- First, combine like terms: 3x + 2 = 28
- Then subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 26
- Divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 8.67

Since ages are given in whole numbers, we will assume that Brooke's age is 8 years old and Seth's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

However, if we check, the total age of both in 2 years won't add up to 28 like mentioned in the problem.

There seems to be a mistake or an inconsistency with the information provided in the problem. {The final answer cannot be determined with the given information.}</s>","To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.

Now let's express the age of Sally Four in terms of Granny Red's age using the given information that Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four:

x + 3 + 5 = 2(x + 3)

Solving this equation for x, we get:

x + 3 + 5 = 2x + 6
x + 3 = 2x
x = x + 3 - 3
x = x + 3 - 3 + 6
x = 2x + 3
x = x + 3*(1/2)
x = (3x + 3)/2
x = 3x/2 - 1.5
x = 2(3x/4 - 0.75)

So, Granny Red is 2 times as old as Sally Four, which is equivalent to Sally Four being 1/2 times as old as Granny Red. Subtracting 3 years from the age of Granny Red, we get the age of Sally Two.

Now we can find the total age of all four birds:

Total age = age of Sally Two + age of Granny Red + age of Sally Four + age of unnamed bird

Total age = (3x/2 - 1.5) + x + [(3x + 3)/2] + [(3x + 3)/2]

This equation does not have a unique solution since x is not defined yet, but it allows us to understand that the total age of the birds is a function of the age of one of them. Unfortunately, the given information does not allow us to find a specific value for the total age.

{There is not enough information to find the final answer.}</s>","If Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, same as Sally four, their total age 8+8 = <<8+8=16>>16 years.
Granny red is two times as old as Sally four, meaning Granny red is 2*8 = <<2*8=16>>16 years old.
Sally Thirtytwo, Sally four, and Sally red are 16+16 = <<32=32>>32 years old.
Sally two is three years older than Granny red, meaning Sally two is 16+3= <<16+3=19>>19 years old.
The four birds have a total age of 32+19 = <<32+19=51>>51 years old.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes Billy to prep all the potatoes, we first need to determine how many minutes it takes him to peel and cut one potato. We know it takes him about 1 minute and 15 seconds (90 seconds) to peel a potato, but only 5 seconds to cut it up. Therefore, the time it takes him to cut each potato is negligible compared to the time it takes to peel them.

So, the time it takes Billy to prep one potato is 1 minute and 15 seconds. Since he has 60 potatoes to prep, we can calculate the total time required by multiplying the time per potato by the number of potatoes.

Time to peel and cut all potatoes = Time per potato * Number of potatoes

= 1 minute and 15 seconds * 60

= 69 minutes

{The final answer is: 69 minutes}</s>","There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.
Billy only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.
So it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.

                 [/INST] To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we first need to find out how many gallons of lemonade they sold to make a profit of $25.

Step 1: Find out how many gallons of lemonade they sold.
Profit per gallon = $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) + $0.50 (per glass) + ($0.50 * 20 (glasses per gallon))
Profit per gallon = $3 + $2 + $0.50 + $10
Profit per gallon = $13.50

They made a profit of $25, so they must have sold:
Number of gallons sold = Profit / Profit per gallon
Number of gallons sold = $25 / $13.50
Number of gallons sold ≈ 1.84 gallons

Since they can't sell a fraction of a gallon, they must have sold 2 gallons of lemonade.

Step 2: Find out how much they spent on lemons for 2 gallons.
Lemons cost $3 per gallon, so they spent:
Amount spent on lemons = Number of gallons sold * Cost per gallon
Amount spent on lemons = 2 gallons * $3/gallon
Amount spent on lemons = $6

{The final answer is: They spent $6 on lemons.}</s>","Each gallon sells for a total of $10 because 20 x .5 = <<20*.5=10>>10

2. Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel: 1/3 * $6000 = $2000
3. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity: $6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $2500
4. Zaid gives his daughter $200 for weekly expenses: $200
5. Zaid gives his wife $700 for groceries and other household goods: $700

Now let's calculate Zaid's total expenses:
$1500 (rent) + $2000 (car fuel) + $2500 (donation) + $200 (daughter's expenses) + $700 (wife's expenses) = $8120

Finally, let's calculate the amount of money Zaid will have left after all these expenses:
$6000 (salary) - $8120 (expenses) = {-$2120}

However, since Zaid cannot have a negative income, thisanswer indicates that Zaid's salary is not enough to cover all his expenses and donations in the given month.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Interpreting the given information.
Sandra, the florist, is very unhappy with Fred's incomplete order, specifically the missing red roses. She had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations and also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm.

Step 2: Finding out the number of red roses ordered.
Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. The number of white carnations is not mentioned directly in the problem, but from the information that she ordered 200 pink calla lilies, five times the number of white carnations, we can infer that there are 400 white carnations in total. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, she ordered 4 * 400 = <ins>1600</ins> red roses.

Step 3: Delivering the missing red roses by 5 pm.
Fred needs to deliver the missing red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. The number of missing red roses is not mentioned directly in the problem. But since Sandra ordered 1600 red roses, and the missing ones need to be delivered by 5 pm, we can find out how many of those 1600 red roses need to be delivered in that time frame.

Step 4: Calculating the required delivery rate.
First, let's calculate the total number of hours between the time Sandra placed the order and the deadline. Assume Sandra placed the order in the morning. Let's say the order was placed at 9 am. The deadline is 5 pm, so the number of hours between the order placement and the deadline is 5 pm - 9 am = 8 hours.

Next, we need to find the required delivery rate. To find out how many red roses should be delivered per hour to meet the deadline, we divide the total number of missing red roses by the number of hours.

Let's assume that all the red roses are missing, and they all need to be delivered by 5 pm. So, in this case, the total number of missing red roses is 1600, and the required delivery rate is 1600 / 8 hours = <ins>200 red roses per hour</ins>.

Step 5: Final answer.
Fred needs to deliver <ins>200 red roses per hour</ins> to keep Sandra's business.</s>","Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies / 5 = <<200/5=40>>40 white carnations.

                 [/INST] To find Jean's age, let's break down the steps in the problem:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan's current age is 30.

Let's represent Mark's age as M and Jan's age as J. According to the information given:

J = 30
M = J - 2 (since Mark is 2 years younger than Jean)

We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. This can be expressed as:

M - 2 = J - (J/2) - 5

Now let's substitute M with (J-2), and solve for J:

(J-2) - 2 = J - (J/2) - 5

To make the equation easier to handle, let's get rid of the negative numbers:

J + 2 - 2 = J - J/2 - 5

Simplify:

J + 2 > J - J/2 - 5

Subtract J from both sides:

2 > J/2 - 5

Multiply both sides by 2 to get an equation with equal powers of J:

4 > J - 10/2

Simplify:

4 > J - 5

Add 5 to both sides:

Using ; this , information, ? how many , seconds will the , faster ! team win by?
                 [/INST] To find out how many seconds the faster team wins by, we need to calculate the time it takes each team to complete one lap and then find the difference between their finishing times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for each team to complete one lap.

For the well-rounded team:
Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds, so the time for one runner is 55 seconds.
Since there are 4 runners in a team, the time for the whole team to complete one lap is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds or 3 minutes and 40 seconds.

For the less well-rounded team:
The first runner takes 60 seconds to complete his leg.
The second runner takes 60 seconds + 3 seconds = 63 seconds to complete his leg.
The third runner takes 60 seconds + 3 seconds = 63 seconds to complete his leg.
The fourth runner takes 60 seconds + 3 seconds = 63 seconds to complete his leg.
So, the time for the whole team to complete one lap is 60 + 63+63+63 = 249 seconds or 4 minutes and 9 seconds.

Now we can find the difference in finishing times:
Difference in finishing times = Time for less well-rounded team - Time for well-rounded team
Difference in finishing times = 249 seconds - 220 seconds
Difference in finishing times = 29 seconds

Therefore, the final answer is: The faster team wins by 29 seconds.</s>","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

                 [/INST] To find the difference in the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 and rolls two even numbers in a row, we first need to calculate the probabilities of each event.

1. Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:
There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 0.5.

2. Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
A pair of even numbers can only be (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (4, 2), (4, 4), or (6, 6). There are 6 favorable outcomes out of a total of 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice. So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 6/36 = 1/6 or approximately 0.1667.

Now, to find the difference in probabilities as a percentage, we can subtract the smaller probability from the larger probability and divide the result by the larger probability:

{The final answer is: [(0.5) - (0.1667)] * 100 = 30.27%}

So, Jerry is about 30.27% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than roll two even numbers in a row.</s>","There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem
We are given that Jenna and her mother picked apples from their apple farm. Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. If her mother picked 20 apples, then how many apples did they both pick?

Step 2: Identify the variables
The number of apples picked by Jenna is directly related to the number of apples picked by her mother. Let's call the number of apples picked by her mother x. Then, the number of apples picked by Jenna would be x/2.

Step 3: Solve the problem
From the problem, we know that x = 20. So, we can find the number of apples picked by Jenna by substituting the value of x into the equation for Jenna's apples:

Jenna's apples = x / 2

Now, we can find the number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mother's apples
Total apples = (x / 2) + x
Total apples = (x + x) / 2

Since x = 20:

Total apples = (20 + 20) / 2
Total apples = 40 / 2

Step 4: Show the final answer
{The final answer is: They both picked 20 apples each, for a total of 40 apples.}</s>","If Jenna got half as many apples as her mom, then she got 1/2 * 20 apples = <<20*1/2=10>>10 apples
Together, they had 10 apples + 20 apples = <<10+20=30>>30 apples

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many pieces of straw are used for each type of rodent.

1. For rats: We have 3 cages, each with 5 rats (since 10 rats are in groups of 5). Therefore, there are a total of 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 rats. Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw; so, 15 rats receive a total of 15 * 6 = <<15*6=90>>90 pieces of straw.

2. For hamsters: We have 10 cages, and each cage holds one hamster, so there are 10 hamsters in total. Each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw, so 10 hamsters receive a total of 10 * 5 = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.

3. For rabbits: We have a pen with rabbits, but the problem doesn't specify how many rabbits there are or how many pieces of straw each one gets. To find the number of rats per cage, we only need to consider the straw given to rats and hamsters.

Given that we distributed 160 pieces of straw among the rodents, we can determine the number of rats in each cage as follows:

The total straw given to rats is 15 rats * 6 pieces/rat = 90 pieces.
The total straw given to hamsters is 10 hamsters * 5 pieces/hamster = 50 pieces.

So, the total straw given to rats and hamsters is 90 + 50 = 140 pieces. But we only distributed 160 pieces, which means there were an additional 20 pieces given to the rabbits. Since the problem states ""No straw is used anywhere else in the store,"" we know that the extra 20 pieces were also used for the rabbits.

However, since the problem doesn't provide information about the number of rabbits or the straw each rabbit gets, we cannot determine the number of rabbits or how many rats are in each cage using the given information. {The final answer is: We cannot determine the number of rats in each cage.}</s>","In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the amount Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months, considering the monthly interest.

We are given that Mandy owes Benedict $100, the monthly interest rate is 2%, and there are three monthly interest periods (since Mandy pays in 3 months).

First, let's calculate the monthly interest by finding 2% of $100:

Monthly interest = Principal * Interest rate
Monthly interest = $100 * 0.02
Monthly interest = $2

Now, we'll find the amount Mandy would owe after three months with the monthly interest added:

Total amount owed = Principal + (Number of interest periods * Monthly interest)
Total amount owed = $100 + (3 * $2)
Total amount owed = $100 + $6
Total amount owed = $106

So, Mandy would owe Benedict $106 after 3 months with monthly interest.

Step 2: Determine how much Mandy should pay Benedict.

To find out how much Mandy should pay Benedict, we'll simply find the difference between the total amount she owes and whatever amount she has already paid. Since Mandy's message suggests that she is asking how much she should give to Benedict (presumably as a lump-sum payment) to satisfy the debt, we infer that she already has no money and has not yet made any payments.

Therefore, Mandy should pay Benedict the total amount that she owes: $106.

{The final answer is: Mandy should pay Benedict $106.}</s>","The monthly interest is $100 x 2/100 = $<<100*2/100=2>>2.
After 3 months, the total interest amount to $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.
Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict a total of $100 + $6 = $<<100+6=106>>106.

                 [/INST] Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The trader buys x bags of wheat from the farmer at $20 per bag. So, the total cost of buying the bags is 20x.
2. It costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse. So, the total transportation cost is 2x.
3. The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags. The profit per bag is the selling price minus the buying price minus the transportation cost, which is $30 - $20 - $2 = $8. So, the number of bags sold is $400 / $8 = 50 bags.

Hence, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. {The final answer is 50.}</s>","Each bag of wheat cost the trader $20+$2=$<<20+2=22>>22 (taking transportation costs into account)

$20.25 ÷ 3 = $6.75

Step 2: Next, we need to find out how much they spent on food. The problem states that they spent $4.50 less on food than they did on tickets. So, the total amount they spent on food is:

$6.75 × 3 (for the tickets) + ($6.75 × 3 - $4.50) (for food) = $20.25 + ($19.81)

Step 3: The problem also states that they went on 2 different rides, with each ride costing $33. So, the total amount they spent on rides is:

$33 × 2 = $66

Step 4: The problem asks us to find out how much each friend paid if they agreed to split all the costs evenly. We have already found out how much they spent on tickets and food. The total amount they spent in total is:

$20.25 (tickets) + $19.81 (food) + $66 (rides) = $106.66

Step 5: To find out how much each friend paid, we divide the total amount by the number of friends:

$106.66 ÷ 3 = $35.56

So, each friend paid approximately $35.56 for the tickets, food, and rides.

{The final answer is: Each friend paid approximately $35.56.}</s>","They spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $<<20.25-4.5=15.75>>15.75 on food.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of trees Tom has after planting and chopping down trees for each year up to the 10th year.

First, let's calculate how many trees Tom has after planting and chopping down trees in one year:
Trees after one year = (Trees planted) - (Trees chopped down)
= 10 (planted) - 2 (chopped down)
= 8 trees

Then, to calculate the number of trees Tom has after 10 years, we can use this formula:

Trees after 10 years = Trees planted in the first year * (1 + Number of growth cycles)

Where Number of growth cycles = Number of years (10) / Number of trees grown in a year (1) = 10

Trees after 10 years = 8 (planted in the first year) * (1 + 10)
= 8 * 11
= 88 trees

Step 2: Calculate the number of trees Tom has left after 13 years (10 planting years + 3 years for trees to die off)

We know that 30% of Tom's trees die off after 10 years. So, we need to determine how many trees are alive.

Number of trees alive after 10 years = Total number of trees after 10 years * (1 - Death percentage)
= 88 trees * (1 - 0.3)
= 88 trees * 0.7
= 61.6 ≈ 62 trees (as we can't have a fraction of a tree)

So, Tom has 62 trees left after 10 years. However, we need to consider the trees planted in the 11th and 12th years, which will be present in the 13th year.

Trees planted in the 11th and 12th years = 10 trees * 2 years
= 20 trees

Tom's total number of trees in the 13th year = Trees alive after 10 years + Trees planted in the 11th and 12th years
= 62 trees + 20 trees
= 82 trees

The final answer is Tom has 82 trees left in the 13th year.</s>","He gets 10-2=<<10-2=8>>8 new trees a year

                 [/INST] To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday, let's calculate the number of pink and white flamingos step by step:

1. On Friday morning, neighbors placed 18 pink flamingos in Sue's front yard.
2. On Saturday morning, they took back one third of the flamingos. Since there were 18 pink flamingos, they took away 6 (one third of 18) flamingos. So, there were now 12 pink flamingos in Sue's front yard.
3. They painted 12 white flamingos and put them back in the front yard, along with the remaining 6 original pink flamingos.
4. On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink flamingos.

So, at noon on Sunday, there were 12 (original pink) + 18 (new pink) = <<12+18=30>>30 pink plastic flamingos, and 12 (white painted) flamingos in Sue's front yard, making a total of 32 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white, we need to subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos. So, the difference is 30 (pink) - 12 (white) = <<30-12=18>>18 pink plastic flamingos.

{The final answer is: 18 pink plastic flamingos were out more than white plastic flamingos.}</s>","On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.
This left 18 pink - 6 = <<18-6=12>>12 pink flamingos.
On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, for a total of 12 + 18 = <<12+18=30>>30 pink flamingos on the front lawn.
Altogether, there were 30 pink and 6 white flamingos on the lawn, so there were 30 pink - 6 white =<<30-6=24>>24 more pink flamingos.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many crayons Violetta can buy with her budget.
Violetta has a budget of $20 and each crayon costs $2.

Step 2: Calculate how many crayons Violetta can buy.
Number of crayons = Budget / Cost per crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Step 3: Check if Violetta can buy 5 different colors with the 10 crayons.
Since Violetta needs 5 different colors and she can only buy 10 crayons, she won't be able to get exactly the number of colors she wants.

Step 4: Determine how much change Violetta will get.
Change = Budget - (Number of crayons * Cost per crayon)
Change = $20 - (10 * $2)
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

However, since Violetta cannot buy exactly 5 different colors with her budget, the question is not answerable as stated. {The final answer is: The question is not answerable as stated.}</s>","Violetta is going to pay 5 * 2 = $<<5*2=10>>10 for the crayons she wants.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understanding the problem
Given:
- The cost of a pen is more than the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined.
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.

We need to find the cost of 8 pens.

Step 2: Analyze the given information
Although the problem states that the cost of a pen is more than the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined, it does not give the exact cost of a pen or an eraser. So, we cannot directly calculate the cost of 8 pens using this information alone.

Step 3: Check for possible solutions
Since we do not have enough information to calculate the cost of 8 pens directly, we need to find additional information or make some assumptions. In this case, we can assume that the problem intended to provide the cost of a pen and an eraser and that the given information about the cost of a pen being more than the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined was a mistake.

Step 4: Find the missing information
To find the cost of 8 pens, we need to know the cost of each pen. Since we do not have this information, we need to go back to the problem statement and ensure that we have all the necessary information.

Unfortunately, in this case, the problem statement does not provide sufficient information for us to calculate the cost of 8 pens. Therefore, we cannot determine the final answer based on the given information alone.

{The final answer is, we cannot determine the cost of 8 pens based on the given information.}</s>","A pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $<<1.20+0.30=1.50>>1.50.
So, 8 pens cost $1.50 x 8 = $<<8*1.5=12>>12.

                 [/INST] To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to determine the total number of pounds of carrots that will be distributed to all 40 restaurants.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of carrots for each restaurant
- Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots

Step 2: Find the total number of pounds of carrots for all restaurants
- 40 restaurants * 2 pounds per restaurant = 80 pounds per restaurant
- Total pounds of carrots = 80 pounds * 40 restaurants = 3200 pounds

Step 3: Find the number of pounds of carrots that will be used
- Given that 2000 ! pounds of carrots are to be distributed
- Therefore, the difference between the total pounds of carrots to be distributed and the total pounds actually given to the restaurants will be the number of pounds that will not be used.
- Unused pounds of carrots = Total pounds to be distributed - Total pounds used

Step 4: Calculate the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used
- Unused pounds of carrots = 2000 ! pounds - 3200 pounds = -1200 ! pounds

The final answer is: The calculation shows a negative result which does not make sense here. The given information that 2000! pounds of carrots are to be distributed to 40 restaurants and each restaurant receive 2 pounds of carrots should be valid. Therefore, it's likely there was a mistake in the calculation, likely a typo, in this problem and the problem statement should have 2000 pounds instead of 2000! (double that amount).

Step 1: Find the number of men and women.
- We are given that there are 8417 men and 9092 women.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of men and women.
- Total number of men = 8417
- Total number of women = 9092
- Total population = 23786

Step 3: Find the total number of men and women by adding their numbers.
- Total population = Total number of men + Total number of women
- 23786 = 8417 + X

Step 4: Solve for X to find the total number of women.
- X = 23786 - 8417
- X = 15369

Step 5: Find the number of children.
- Total population = Total number of men + Total number of women + Total number of children
- 23786 = 8417 + 9092 + Total number of children

1. In the first month, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month. So, she collected 20 - 20 = 0 cards less, which means she collected 20 cards in the second month.
3. In the third month, she collected twice the number of cards she collected in the first and second months combined. So, she collected 20 (from the first month) + 20 (from the second month) * 2 = 20 + 40 = 60 cards in the third month.
4. Therefore, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is 20 (from the first month) + 20 (from the second month) + 60 (from the third month) = 100 cards.

                 [/INST] To find out how much Mark makes in a week from Publisher A and Publisher B, we first need to find out how many sentences he edits for each publisher and how much he gets paid per sentence for each.

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A as x, and the number of sentences he edits for Publisher B as y.

1. We know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
x + y = 1000

2. We also know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.
Amount paid by Publisher A = 5cx

3. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A, so Publisher B pays him 10 cents per sentence.
Amount paid by Publisher B = 10cy

4. Since Mark edits the same number of sentences for each publisher each week, we can set up an equation relating the number of sentences and the amount of money he earns from each publisher.
5cx + 10cy = 1000(5c + 10c) = 1000 * 15c = 15000c

5. Solving this equation for c, we get c = 1000.

6. Now we can find the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher.
x = 1000 - y
x + y = 1000
y = 1000 - x

7. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence and Publisher B pays twice as much, we know that y = 2x.

8. Substituting x = 500 into this equation (since x and y must be integers), we find that y = 1000, which is not a valid solution since x + y = 1000 and x = 500 would result in x + 1000 > 1000.

9. Therefore, this problem doesn't have a valid solution as per the given constraints.

However, if we assume that Mark edits the same number of sentences for both publishers each week, which is the implication of the problem statement but not explicitly stated, then we have:

x = y = 500
Amount paid by Publisher A = 5cx = 5 * 500c = 2500c
Amount paid by Publisher B = 10cy = 10 * 500c = 5000c
Total amount Mark earns in a week = 2500c + 5000c = 7500c

{The final answer is 7500c cents}

Note: As mentioned earlier, the assumption of Mark editing the same number of sentences for both publishers each week is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the problem statement. If this assumption is not valid, then the problem has no valid solution within the given constraints.</s>","Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.
From Publisher A, he earns 5 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<5*500=2500>>2500 cents.
Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.
Thus, he earns 2500 + 5000 = <<2500+5000=7500>>7500 cents in total.

Step 2: Determine the amount of the one-time monetary reward.
The amount of the monetary reward is $5000.

Step 3: Calculate John's new annual salary after the 5% raise.
To find out John's new annual salary, we need to calculate 5% of his initial annual salary and add the one-time reward to it:
5% of $104,000 = 0.05 * $104,000 = $5,200
New annual salary = $104,000 + $5,200 = $109,200

Step 4: Determine John's earnings in the year he received the award.
To find out John's earnings in the year he received the award, we need to calculate his weekly earnings after the award and how many weeks were paid after the award. Since he received the award on the first day of the year, the first week's salary remains the same.
Weekly earnings after the award = $2000
Number of weeks paid after the award = 51 (52 weeks in a year - 1 week before the award)

1. Carl ate a cheese sandwich for lunch every day this week. He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. So, the number of slices he used for lunch is 2 slices/sandwich * number of sandwiches/week.
2. He also had cheese and egg omelets for breakfast for 3 days in the week. He used one more slice per omelet than per sandwich. So, the number of slices he used for breakfast is 2 slices/sandwich (for the extra slice) * 3 omelets/day * 3 days.
3. He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.

Putting it all together:
1. Number of slices for lunch = 2 slices/sandwich * number of sandwiches/week
2. Number of slices for breakfast = 2 slices/sandwich (for the extra slice) * 3 omelets/day * 3 days
3. Number of slices for dinner = 8 slices

{The final answer is the sum of slices of cheese used for lunch, breakfast, and dinner: 2 slices/sandwich * number of sandwiches/week + 2 slices/sandwich (for the extra slice) * 3 omelets/day * 3 days + 8 slices}

To find the exact number, we need to know how many sandwiches Carl had for lunch and how many omelets he had for breakfast in a week. Let's assume he had 5 sandwiches and 3 omelets respectively.

He allows ; the students to remove the ? lowest score , from , the average each ! semester. ; If , Brinley has scores , of ; 89, 71, 92, : 100 and 86 on ; the ? first five tests, ; what score . does , she ! need ; on ; the sixth ; test , to ; get : an . average of 93?
                 [/INST] To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to reach an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find Brinley's current semester average.
   To calculate her current average, we sum the scores of the first five tests and divide by five: (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5
   Simplifying the calculation: (348) / 5 = 69.6

2. Since the average should be rounded up to 93, we need to find the number we need to add to her current average to reach 93.
   93 = 69.6 + X
    X = 23.4

3. However, Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score before calculating the average semester score. Brinley needs to have six tests scores to be able to remove the lowest score, so we need to figure out which of her current scores will be dropped.

4. To determine the score that will be removed, we need to find her Semester Score without the lowest score. First, let's find her current Semester Score with all the scores.
   Semester Score = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 + X) / 6
   Simplifying the calculation: (348 + X) / 6

5. To find the score that will be removed, we need to find the lowest score among her current five test scores that is less than X. This score is 71.

6. Since Brinley will drop her lowest score of 71 and then needs an average of 93 for her other five scores, we need to calculate the average of her remaining five scores and add 2.7 (which is 3% of the target average of 93) to ensure a final average of 93.
   Average of Remaining Scores = (89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + X) / 5
   Simplifying the calculation: (377 + X) / 5
   93 = (377 + X) / 5

7. Solving for X:
   4 * 93 = 377 + X
   372 = X + 377
    X = 65

8. Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 65 or higher on the sixth test to achieve the semester average of 93. {The final answer is 65}.</s>","First, identify the lowest score, which is 71, and remove it.
Since Brinley wants a score of 93, we know her total score needs to be 93 (average) * 5 (tests) = <<93*5=465>>465 points
So far, Brinley has earned 89 + 92 +100 + 86 = <<89+92+100+86=367>>367 points
The final test must be 465 - 367 = <<465-367=98>>98 points.

Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week, so in four weeks, he rode:
5 rides/week * 4 weeks = 20 rides

Step 2: Calculate the total distance he covered during the first four weeks.
He rode 25 kilometers each time, so during the first four weeks, he covered:
20 rides * 25 kilometers/ride = 500 kilometers

Step 3: Calculate the number of rides per week during the last three weeks.
He rode the bike only 2 times a week, so in three weeks, he rode:
2 rides/week * 3 weeks = 6 rides

Step 4: Calculate the total distance he covered during the last three weeks.
He rode 60 kilometers each time, so during the last three weeks, he covered:
6 rides * 60 kilometers/ride = 360 kilometers

Step 5: Calculate the total distance Micheal covered in total.
Total distance = distance covered during first 4 weeks + distance covered during last 3 weeks

Step 1: Find the weight of the chocolate bars.
We know that there are 25 chocolate bars, and each chocolate bar weighs 40g.
So, the total weight of the chocolate bars is: 25 chocolate bars * 40g per chocolate bar = 1000g or 1kg

Step 2: Find the weight of the candied apples.
We know that there are 80 candied apples, and each candied apple weighs half as much as a chocolate bar. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, a candied apple weighs 20g.
So, the total weight of the candied apples is: 80 candied apples * 20g per candied apple = 1600g or 1.6kg

Step 3: Find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy.
Total weight = weight of chocolate bars + weight of candied apples
Total weight = 1kg (chocolate) + 1.6kg (apples) = 2.6kg

2. On Tuesday, Rose went to a different store and bought 3 cakes, which is three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday (3 x 4 = 12 cakes).
3. On Wednesday, Rose went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday (5 x 12 = 60 cakes).

To find the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days, we simply add up the number of cakes she bought on each day:

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, let's figure out how many cups are being bought. We know that 20 dozens of cups cost less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.
2. We also know that a dozen is equal to 12, so 20 dozens is the same as 20 * 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.
3. The total cost of these 240 cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, so the total cost of the cups is $1200 + $6000 = $<<1200+6000=7200>>7200.
4. Since we have 240 cups and we want to find the cost of each individual cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups: $7200 / 240 = $<<7200/240=29.916666666666666>>29.9167 per cup (approximately)

{The final answer is: Approximately $29.9167 per cup.}</s>","Since a dozen has 12 items, half a dozen plates are 12/2 = <<6=6>>6
Half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each cost 6*$6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000
Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800
Since a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.
If the twenty dozen cups cost $34800, each cup costs $34800/240=$<<34800/240=145>>145

1. Money Sara earned from babysitting:
   - Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time.
   - Therefore, she earned a total of 4 * $5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 from babysitting.

2. Money Sara earned from mowing the lawn:
   - We're told that her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we know that Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting.
   - So, she earned a total of $10 (saved) + $4 * (number of times she mowed the lawn) from mowing the lawn.

3. How many times Sara has to mow the lawn to buy a jacket and two pairs of shoes:
   - The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and two pairs of shoes is $30 + ($20 * 2) = $<<30+20*2=90>>90.
   - To find out how many times she has to mow the lawn to afford that, we set up the equation: $10 (saved) + $4 * (number of times she mowed the lawn) = $90
   - Solving this equation, we get: number of times she mowed the lawn = ($90 - $10) / $4 = $<<(90-10)/4=21.25>>21.25. Since she can't mow the lawn that many times in half, she needs to mow the lawn $22 times in total.

{The final answer is: Sara needs to mow the lawn 22 times to afford a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes}</s>","Both pairs of shoes will cost a total of 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.
Sara will need to save a total of $30 + $40 = $<<30+40=70>>70 to buy everything that she wants.
Sara has earned 4 * $5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 from babysitting.
Between her savings and the babysitting, Sara has already saved $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=30>>30.
Sara needs to earn an additional $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 from mowing the lawn to afford her clothes.

1. Let x be the number of red chickens and y be the number of white chickens.
2. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so the number of eggs produced by red chickens is 3x a day.
3. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so the number of eggs produced by white chickens is 5y a day.
4. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. So, the total number of eggs produced by all the chickens is 3x + 5y = 42.
5. We are given that y = x + 2, which means white chickens are two more than red chickens.
6. Substituting y in the total number of eggs equation, we get 3x + 5(x + 2) = 42.
7. Solving this equation, we get 3x + 5x + 10 = 42.
8. Combining like terms, we get 8x = 32.
9. Dividing both sides by 8, we get x = 4.
10. So, Jerry has 4 red chickens in his flock.

{The final answer is: Jerry has 4 red chickens.}</s>","First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.

Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4

Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. This means he covers a distance of 3 miles every hour.

Step 3: Determine how long it takes Gary to cover the area of the park.
To find out how many hours it takes Gary to walk around the park, we need to divide the area of the park by the area he covers per hour: Hours = Area of park / Area covered per hour

Calculation for Step 1:Area = 1.5 miles * 6 miles = 9 square miles

Calculation for Step 2:Area covered per hour = 3 miles/hour * 1 hour = 3 square miles/hour

                    question:
                    Jerry has , two pools, , both with leaks emptying ! them ; out at 4 ? gallons/minute. ? 4 ! minutes ago, , the , big pool ! had twice as . much water ! as . the small pool. . Now the big . pool ? has , four times as : much ? water as . the small ; pool. . How much , water does the small ; pool : have now?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the volume of the small pool as x and the volume of the big pool as y. We are given the following information:

1. The small pool leaks at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
2. The big pool leaks at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
3. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
4. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

We know that the rate of change of the volume of a pool is equal to the leak rate. So, if we denote the rate of change of the volume of the small pool (dx/dt) and the big pool (dy/dt), we have:

dx/dt = -4
dy/dt = -4

Now let's convert the information about the volumes of the pools given in the problem into mathematical equations. The fact that ""four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool"" can be written as:

y = 2x

The fact that ""now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool"" can be written as:

y = 4x

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1. x' (the current value of x) = x + dx
2. y' (the current value of y) = y + dy

We can find dx (the change in the volume of the small pool) by integrating the equation dx/dt:

dx = ∫(-4)dt
dx = -4t

Now we want to find the current value of x (the volume of the small pool). We can use the information given in the problem that ""four minutes have passed since the last measurement."" So, t = 4, and we have:

dx = -4 * 4
dx = -16

To find x, we need to find the initial value of x, which is the value of x four minutes ago when the big pool had twice as much water:

x' = x + dx
x + dx = x + (-16)
dx = -16
x = x -16

Since we don't know the initial value of x, we cannot find x directly. However, we can find the volume of the small pool in terms of the volume of the big pool.

The given information ""y = 2x"" tells us that the initial ratio of the volumes of the pools was 2:1. Since the big pool now has four times the volume of the small pool, the current ratio of the volumes is 4:1.

We can use this information to write x as a function of y:

x = y/4

Now we can find the volume of the small pool:

xs = x * 4
xs = y/4 * 4
xs = y

So, the final answer is:

{The small pool has the same volume as the big pool now, which is y gallons.}

Alternatively, we could have expressed the solution in terms of the initial volume of the small pool:

{If the initial volume of the small pool was x, then the current volume of the small pool is x/4 of the current volume of the big pool.}

The confusion in the wording of the problem results in an ambiguous statement that cannot be directly answered without knowing the initial volume of the small pool.</s>","First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons
Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8

Total amount to be earned = $320 + $32
Total amount to be earned = $352

Next, we need to find out how many hours it takes for Lori to earn $352 from her part-time job.

Hours worked = Total amount earned / Hourly wage
Hours worked = $352 / $8.00
Hours worked = 44.00 hours

However, since Lori cannot work for a fraction of an hour, she would need to work an additional hour to reach the next whole number of hours.

- Janeth borrowed $2000
- She promises to return $2200 ($2000 plus 10% of $2000)
- She will be paying $165 a month for 12 months

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Janeth will be paying back over the 12 month period.
To calculate this, we'll find out how much she pays each month, and then multiply that by the number of months.

Monthly payment = $165
Number of months = 12

Total payment = Monthly payment × Number of months
Total payment = $165 × 12
Total payment = $1980

Step 3: Subtract the total amount Janeth paid from what she originally promised to pay back.

Janeth's original promise = $2200
Total payment = $1980

Janeth's remaining balance = Original promise - Total payment
Janeth's remaining balance = $2200 - $1980
Janeth's remaining balance = $220

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months of repayment is $220.

{The final answer is: $220}</s>","Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.
So she is going to pay off a total of $2000 + $200 = $<<2000+200=2200>>2200.
Janeth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.
Hence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.

Step 2: We're told there are 7 more dahlias than roses in the vase. So, we need to find out how many dahlias there are.

Step 3: To find the number of dahlias, we add 7 to the number of roses: Dahlias = Roses + 7

Step 4: Substituting the given value of Roses (4) into the equation above: Dahlias = 4 + 7

Step 5: Solving the equation, we find that there are 11 dahlias in the vase.

Step 6: To find the total number of flowers in the vase, simply add the number of roses and dahlias: Total flowers = Roses + Dahlias

Step 7: Substituting the calculated value of Dahlias (11) and the given value of Roses (4) into the equation above: Total flowers = 4 + 11

Step 8: Solving the equation, we find that there are 15 flowers in the vase.

3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. So, Adrian's age would be 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.
4. We want to find the average age of Harriet, Adrian, and Zack in three years.
5. In three years, Harriet's age will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
6. Adrian's age in three years will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
7. Zack's age in three years will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.
8. To find the average age, we simply add up their ages in three years and then divide by the total number of people (3).

Step 2: We know that Yuri scored 10 more points than half of Naomi's score. Let's find half of Naomi's score.
Half of Naomi's score = 68 points / 2 = 34 points

Step 3: We know that Yuri scored 10 more points than half of Naomi's score. So, Yuri scored:
Yuri's score = Half of Naomi's score + 10 points = 34 points + 10 points = 44 points

Step 4: We also know that Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score was:

Total points scored = Naomi's score + Yuri's score + Brianna's score
Total points scored = 68 points + 44 points + 85 points = 197 points

So, the total number of points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 197 points. Therefore, the number of points Jojo scored is the difference between the total number of points and the sum of the points scored by the other students:
Jojo's score = Total points scored - (Naomi's score + Yuri's score + Brianna's score)
Jojo's score = 251 points - (68 points + 44 points + 85 points)
Jojo's score = 251 points - 197 points

Step 2: The problem also states that he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. Thus, the number of petunias he plants can be found by subtracting 40 from the number of geraniums.

Step 3: To find the number of petunias, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums: 90 geraniums - 40 petunias less = 50 geraniums + number of petunias = total number of flowers

We first find the number of geraniums but in the form of 50 more than the number of petunias: 90 geraniums = 50 + number of petunias

Step 4: Solving the equation above for the number of petunias, we have: number of petunias = 90 - 50 = 40

Step 5: Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is the sum of the number of geraniums and petunias: 90 geraniums + 40 petunias = 130 flowers.

1. We know that it takes 6 days for Andrew to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus.
2. We're also told that it takes half the number of days to travel the same distance by car.
3. To find out how many days it takes Andrew to travel to Rochester by car, we need to find half the number of days it takes by bus, which is 6 days / 2 = 3 days.
4. Therefore, it takes 3 days for Andrew to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car.
5. Since Andrew is traveling to Rochester by bus and returning by car, we need to find the total number of days for this round trip.
6. Andrew spends 6 days traveling from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, and 3 days returning from Rochester to New Jersey by car.
7. So the total number of days for Andrew's road trip is 6 (bus) + 3 (car) = 9 days.

                 [/INST] To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card is a water type after James loses 8 water type cards and buys 14 grass type cards, we'll first find out how many cards James has in each type after these transactions.

1. Initially, James has 30 fire type cards, 20 grass type cards, and 40 water type cards. In total, he has 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards.

2. He loses 8 water type cards, so he now has 30 + 20 + (40 - 8) = 30 + 20 + 32 = 82 water type cards.

3. He then buys 14 grass type cards, so the total number of cards he now has is 82 + 14 = 96 cards.

4. Since he initially had 30 fire, 20 grass, and 40 water types, we know that after losing cards and buying new ones, the distribution of card types in his collection will be different. We'll calculate the exact percentages as follows:

5. There are now 82 water type cards out of a total of 96 cards, so the percentage of water type cards James has is 82/96 = 44.44%.

6. To round this percentage to the nearest integer, we can simply look at the first digit, which is 4, and add 0.5 if the second digit is 5 or greater. Since the second digit is less than 5, the percentage remains as 44.44%. There's no need to round up because the percentage probability is not something that directly affects the outcome of a game or event.

{The final answer is: 44% (rounded to the nearest integer)}.</s>","First find the final number of grass type Pokemon: 20 grass type + 14 grass type = <<20+14=34>>34 grass type
Then find the final number of water type Pokemon: 40 water type - 8 water type = <<40-8=32>>32 water type
Then add the number of each type of Pokemon to find the total number: 34 Pokemon + 32 Pokemon + 30 Pokemon = <<34+32+30=96>>96 Pokemon
Then divide the number of water type Pokemon by the total number of Pokemon and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 32 water type / 96 Pokemon * 100% = 33.333...%, which rounds down to 33%

base burrito cost = $6.50

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the additions: extra meat, extra cheese, avocado, and 2 sauces.
cost of extra meat = $2.00
cost of extra cheese = $1.00
cost of avocado = $1.00
cost of 2 sauces = $0.50 (since each sauce costs $0.25)

Total cost of additions = $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50

Step 3: Calculate the cost of Chad's burrito with additions.
cost of burrito with additions = base burrito cost + cost of additions = $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the upgrade: chips and a drink.
cost of upgrade = $3.00

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of Chad's meal with the upgrade and the use of the gift card.
total cost = cost of burrito with additions + cost of upgrade - gift card amount = $11.00 + $3.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

                 [/INST] Let's call the number of pieces Kalinda can add per minute ""K's rate"" and the number of pieces her mom can place per minute ""Mom's rate.""

We know that:
1. Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. (K's rate = 4)
2. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. (Mom's rate = 4 / 2 = 2)

Given that they're working on a 360-piece puzzle, we need to figure out how long it will take them to complete it together.

The work they do in a minute is the sum of the pieces Kalinda adds and the pieces her mom places:

Total work in a minute = K's rate + Mom's rate = 4 + 2 = 6

Since they're working jointly, their combined rate is 6 pieces per minute.

Now we can find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle:

Total work needed to complete the puzzle = 360 pieces

Minutes needed to complete the puzzle = Total work / Combined rate = 360 / 6 = 60 minutes

Finally, we need to find out how many hours it will take them to complete the puzzle:

Hours needed to complete the puzzle = Minutes needed / 60 minutes/hour = 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

So, the answer is:

{The final answer is: it will take them 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.}</s>","Her mom places 2 pieces per minute because 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2
On average they get in 6 pieces per minute because 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6

It will take one hour because 60 / 60 = <<60/60=1>>1

Number of ready watermelons = 0.3 * 120 = 36 watermelons

Now, we know that Ashlyn took these 36 watermelons home. So, the number of watermelons that were not yet ready after the first visit was:

Number of unharvested watermelons (after the first visit) = 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons

During her next visit, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest. So, we need to calculate how many watermelons became ready during this second visit:

Number of new ready watermelons = Unharvested watermelons (before the second visit) * (3/4)
Number of new ready watermelons = 84 * (3/4) = 62.5
Since we cannot have 0.5 watermelon, we round this up to the nearest whole number:
Number of new ready watermelons = 63 watermelons

Now, we can find out how many watermelons were not yet ready after the second visit:

Number of unharvested watermelons (after the second visit) = Unharvested watermelons (before the second visit) - New ready watermelons
Number of unharvested watermelons (after the second visit) = 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons

Step 2: Calculate the amount of tax paid on the cars.
Mark pays a 10% tax on the cars.
Tax on cars = $240,000 * 0.1 = $24,000

Step 3: Calculate the registration cost for all the cars.
There are 12 cars, and the registration cost is $1,000 per car.
Registration cost = $1,000 * 12 = $12,000

Step 4: Find the total cost mark pays.

4. A single vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.
5. To find out how many tomatoes one vine produces in a week, we multiply the number of tomatoes produced per week by the number of weeks in a year (52): 3 tomatoes/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 tomatoes/year.
6. Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes Steve eats in a year and then divide that number by the number of tomatoes one vine produces in a year to find out how many vines he needs.

1. Each friend should have 4 slices.
2. One pizza is sliced into 8 pieces.
3. So, we need to find out how many pizzas are needed to provide 8 slices per friend.

Let's calculate the number of pizzas required to give each friend 8 slices:

1 pizza = 8 slices
4 slices for one friend = (_)_ pizzas

Now, let's calculate the value of the variable to find out the number of pizzas required:

4 slices per friend = (_)_ pizzas
4 = 8 x _

Divide both sides by 8:
_ = 0.5
So, 1 friend requires 1 pizza (0.5 x 8 = 4)

Now, we need to find out how many pizzas are required for 20 friends:

Total number of friends = 20

                 [/INST] To find out how many total pens Ram will have, we need to calculate how many new pens he can make from the 25 pens he buys and the pens he refills.

First, let's find out how many new pens Ram can make from one full pen and the saved ink from five empty pens. Since Ram can refill one pen using ink from five empty pens, he effectively gets one new pen free every time he refills an old pen.

Next, let's look at how many pens Ram buys initially. He buys 25 pens.

Now, we can calculate how many total pens Ram will have:

1. Ram starts with 0 full pens
2. He buys 25 new pens > Ram now has 25 full pens
3. Every time Ram uses up the ink in a pen and refills it from five empty pens, he creates one new pen
4. Since Ram initially had 25 full pens, and he creates a new pen each time he refills an old pen, Ram will make 25 new pens by refilling the old pens
5. Ram now has a total of 25 original pens + 25 refilled pens = 50 pens

Therefore, {The final answer is: Ram will have a total of 50 pens}</s>","He can make 5 pens when the 25 run low because 25 / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5
He can make 1 pen when the ink in the re-made pens runs low because 5 / 1 = <<5/1=5>>5
He will have 31 total pens because 25 + 5 + 1 = <<25+5+1=31>>31

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is Jessa's age plus five years. Let's denote Jessa's age as X.

Step 2: We also know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. So, Mary's age is Joan's age (X + 5) minus two years.

Step 3: To find the sum of their ages, we can add their individual ages together.

Step 6: Since Jessa's age is given as 20, we can find the value of X:

X = 20 - 5
X = 15

C, calculate : the ! number ! of ! students who went ! out through : exit . C.
                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step.

1. First, let's find the number of students who left through exits A and B. We know that 30% left through A, and 3/5 of the remaining students left through B.

2. Let N be the original number of students in the hall. After the meeting, 70% of N remained in the hall. So, the number of students who left is 30% of N.

3. Let x be the number of students who left through exit A. Then, the number of students who left through exit B is (2/3) * (N-x).

4. Since the total number of students who left is the sum of those who went through exits A and B, we have:

   x + (2/3) * (N-x) = 0.3 * N

5. Solving this equation for N, we get N = (3x)/(x+2).

6. Now we want to find the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the number of students who remained in the hall after those who left through A and B went out. Let y be the number of students who went out through exit C.

7. We know that the total number of students who went out through all three exits is 30% of N. So, we have:

   x + (2/3) * (N-x) + y = 0.3 * N

8. Substituting the expression for N from step 5, we get:

   x + (2/3) * (3x/(x+2)-x) + y = 0.3 * (3x/(x+2))

9. Simplifying this equation, we get:

   x + (2/3) * (3x/3)/(x+2) + y = (1/2) * 3x/1

10. Solving for y, we get:

    y = (3x/2) - x/2 - x/2 - [(2/3)/(x+2)] * 3x

    y = 3x/2 - x - x/2 - 2x * (2/3)/(x+2)

11. Simplifying further, we get:

    y = x + (2/3) * x - (x/2 + 2x/(3(x+2)))

12. This fraction can be simplified to:

    y = x + (2/3) * x - (x/2 + 2x/(3(x+2)))
          = x + (2/3) * x - (x/2 + 2x/(3x+6x+6))
          = x + (2/3) * x - (x/2 + 2x/(3x+6+6))
          = x + (2/3) * x - (x/2 + 2x/(6x+12+6))
          = x + (2/3) * x - (x/2 + 2x/(12x+12+6))
          = x + (2/3) * x - (x/2 + 2x/(12+12+6))
          = x + (2/3) * x - (x/2 + 2x/18)
          = x + (2/3) * x - (x/2 + x/9)
          = x(1+2/3) - (1+1/9)x

13. Factoring out x, we get:

    y = x(7/6 - 1/9)

14. Multiplying the fractions, we get:

    y = x * (21/18)

15. Finally, we need to find the value of x. Since x is the number of students who went out through exit A, and 30% of N went out in total, we have:

    x = 0.3 * N

16. Substituting N with the expression from step 5, we get:

    x = 0.3 * (3x/(x+2))

17. Solving for x, we get:

    x = (x+2)/","The number of students who went out through exit A is 30/100%1000 = 300 students.
The number of students who didn't use exit A is 1000-300 = <<1000-300=700>>700
3/5 of the students used exit B, a total of 3/5*700 = <<3/5*700=420>>420 students.
If 420 of the remaining students who didn't use exit A used exit B, the number who used exit C is 700-420 = 280 students.

- James has 6 more candies than Robert. This means Robert has X candies and James has X + 6 candies.
- John has twice as many candies as Robert. This means John has 2X candies.

Step 2: Find out how many candies Robert has.
From the first piece of information, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, if James has 54 candies, Robert must have 54 - 6 = 48 candies.

Step 3: Find out how many candies John has.
From the second piece of information, we know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. So, John has 2 * 48 = 96 candies.

Step 4: Find the difference in the number of candies between John and James.
The difference in the number of candies is the number of candies John has minus the number of candies James has. In this case, that's 96 (John's candies) and 54 (James' candies). The difference is 42 candies: 96 - 54 = 42.

1. Dolly reads 2 books of her own.
2. Dolly reads 1 book of Pandora's.
3. Pandora reads 2 books of her own.
4. Pandora reads 1 book of Dolly's.

So the total number of books Dolly reads is 2 + 1 = 3 books.
And the total number of books Pandora reads is 2 + 1 = 3 books.

{The final answer is: Each person will read a total of 3 books (their own and the other person's)}

Therefore, the total number of books they will both read collectively is:

1. Mike has a pen pal relationship with 5 people.
2. He stopped being penpals with 2 of them. So currently, he writes letters to 3 people.
3. Each letter is 5 pages long.
4. He receives 2 letters a week from each pen pal, which is 2 x 3 = 6 letters a week.
5. He writes one response letter for each letter he receives, so he writes 6 letters a week.
6. Each letter takes him 1 hour to write (1 page every 6 minutes, which is 6 minutes per page, so 5 pages take 5 x 6 = 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours or 30 minutes for one letter, so 3 letters take 3 letters x 0.5 hours/letter = 1.5 hours).

1. We know that Jason has a phone plan with 1000 minutes per month.
2. Every day, he has a 15-minute call with his boss, so the number of minutes he spends on this call per day is 15. Therefore, the number of minutes he spends on this call in a month with 30 days is: 15 minutes/call * 30 calls/month = 450 minutes.
3. He also had 300 extra minutes this month.
4. The total number of minutes Jason used this month is: 450 minutes (with his boss) + 300 minutes (extra) = 750 minutes.
5. Since his plan includes 1000 minutes per month, but he has used 750 minutes this month, he has: 1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes left for the rest of the month.

                 [/INST] To find out how many fries Ginger gave to Griffin, let's first determine how many fries Griffin had left after everyone took their shares.

1. Griffin started with 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so he took 5 * 2 = 10 fries. Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
4. Colby took 3 less fries than the number of fries Kyle took, so he took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.

So, Griffin ended up having 7 fries. Since Griffin had 27 fries in the end, we can find out how many fries Ginger gave him by subtracting the number of fries each person took from the final amount:

1. Griffin started with 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5, Billy took 10, Colby took 2, and Griffin himself had 7 fries.
3. So, the total number of fries taken by everyone else was 5 +10+2 = 17 fries.
4. Griffin ended up with 27 - 17 = 10 fries more than what was taken from him.
5. Since Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries, we can assume that her contribution was less than the number of fries Griffin had left at the end. However, the problem states that Griffin had exactly 27 fries in the end. This indicates that Ginger gave Griffin exactly enough fries to make up the difference between the number of fries he started with and the number of fries he ended up with.

Hence, {Ginger gave Griffin 10 fries}.</s>","Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, removing 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 fries.
Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, removing 5-3=<<5-3=2>>2 fries.
If we let X be the number of fries given to Griffin by Ginger, then 24-5-10-2+x=27

4. To find the total cost for the entire 5-week movie shooting, we need to multiply the cost per week by the number of weeks:

   Total cost = Cost per week * Number of weeks
   Total cost = $6000 * 5
   Total cost = $30000

5. Lastly, her makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount after the movie is done. So, the final amount Jean pays would be:

   Final amount = Total cost - (Total cost * Discount percentage)
   Final amount = $30000 - ($30000 * 0.1)
   Final amount = $30000 - $3000
   Final amount = $29700

{The final answer is: Jean paid $29,700 for her makeup during the movie shoot.}</s>","Jean pays 250*6=$<<250*6=1500>>1500 a day
So he pays 1500*4=$<<1500*4=6000>>6000 a week
So the work cost 6000*5=$<<6000*5=30000>>30,000
They give a discount of 30,000*.1=$<<30000*.1=3000>>3000
So the total cost paid is 30,000-3000=$<<30000-3000=27000>>27,000

                 [/INST] To find out how much each person paid, we first need to find the total cost of the party supplies and then divide that amount by the number of people paying. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. Determine the cost of each item:
   - Cake ingredients: $12
   - Presents: $43
   - Decorations: $15
   - Invitations: $4
   - Goodie bags: $22

2. Add up all the costs:
   $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $82

3. There are three people paying: Isabelle and her two parents.

4. Divide the total cost by the number of people paying:
   $82 / 3 = $27.33 (approximately, since it's not possible to divide $82 evenly by 3)

5. Since Isabelle is asking for the exact amount each person paid, we need to find a way to evenly divide the total cost. One possibility is to ask her parents to cover the difference of $0.33 and round down the amount each person pays by $0.10 or $0.20.

6. Assuming each parent covers the rounding, the adjusted amount each person pays is:
   $27.20 / person

The final answer is: Each person paid approximately $27.20.</s>","Isabelle spent 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = $<<12+43+15+4+22=96>>96 on party supplies.
The cost was evenly split 3 ways, so each person paid 96 / 3 = $<<96/3=32>>32.

1. The chef bought 4 bags of onions.
2. Each bag weighs 50 pounds.
3. A pound of onions costs $1.50.

First, let's find out how many pounds of onions the chef bought in total:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Next, let's find out how much the chef spent on the onions in pounds:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

Therefore, the final answer is: {The chef spent $300 on onions}.</s>","A bag of onions cost $1.50 x 50 = $<<1.5*50=75>>75.

                 [/INST] Let's call the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday ""Sue's Monday cookies"" and the number of cookies Sue's sister ate on Monday ""Sister's Monday cookies.""

1. On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Let x be the number of cookies Sister's Monday cookies. Then Sue had 4x cookies.

2. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Let y be the number of cookies Sister's Tuesday cookies. Then Sue had 2y cookies.

3. We know that Sister's Monday cookies were 5 and Sister's Tuesday cookies were 13.

4. Use the given information to create a system of linear equations:
   4x = Sue's Monday cookies
   x = Sister's Monday cookies
   Sue's Monday cookies + Sue's Tuesday cookies = Sue's total cookies
   _______ = 5 (Sister's Monday cookies)
   _______ = 13 (Sister's Tuesday cookies)

5. To find Sue's Monday cookies, replace Sister's Monday cookies in the first and fourth equations with 5 and solve:
  4x = 5 * 4
  4x = 20
   x = 5
   Sue's Monday cookies = 4 * 5 = 20

6. Using this value of x (Sister's Monday cookies), we can now find Sue's Tuesday cookies:
   Sue's Monday cookies + Sue's Tuesday cookies = Sue's total cookies
  20 + Sue's Tuesday cookies = Sue's total cookies
   Sue's Tuesday cookies = Sue's total cookies - 20

7. Since we don't have a value for Sue's total cookies, we can't directly calculate Sue's Tuesday cookies. However, we do know that Sue consumed more calories than her sister on both days combined.

8. Let z be the number of calories Sue consumed on Tuesday, and w be the number of calories Sister's ate on Tuesday.

9. We know that Sue consumed 4 times as many calories on Monday as her sister and 2 times as many calories on Tuesday as her sister. Using the given information that 1 cookie has 200 calories.

10. Let's calculate the calories Sue consumed on both days and the calories her sister consumed on both days:
   Sue's calories on Monday = Sue's Monday cookies * 200
   Sue's calories on Monday = 20 * 200 = 4000
   Sister's calories on Monday = Sister's Monday cookies * 200
   Sister's calories on Monday = 5 * 200 = 1000
   Sue's calories on Tuesday = Sue's Tuesday cookies * 200
   Sister's calories on Tuesday = w * 200

11. From the given information, we know that Sue consumed more calories on Monday than her sister and more calories on Tuesday than her sister. Thus, we can write the following inequality:
   4000 > 1000 + z

12. Since we don't have an explicit value for z, we can't calculate the exact number of calories Sue consumed more than her sister, but we do know there is a difference and this difference is greater than 3000 calories.

So, to answer the question:
The final answer is: Sue consumed more than 3000 calories than her sister on both days.</s>","Sue’s Monday cookie intake is 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20.
Sue’s Tuesday cookie intake is 2*13 = <<2*13=26>>26.

Total students = Number of classes * Students per class
Total students = 3 classes * 20 students/class = 60 students

Step 2: Find out the number of boys and girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, we have:
Number of boys = 0.5 * Total students
Number of boys = 0.5 * 60 students = 30 students
Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
Number of girls = 60 students - 30 students = 30 students

Step 3: We are given the number of girls in the first and second classes. Let's find the number of boys in these classes first:
Number of boys in Class 1 = Total students in Class 1 - Number of girls in Class 1
Number of boys in Class 1 = 20 students/class * 1 class - 15 girls = 5 boys

Number of boys in Class 2 = Total students in Class 2 - Number of girls in Class 2
Number of boys in Class 2 = 20 students/class * 1 class - 12 girls = 8 boys

Step 4: Since there are 30 boys in total, we can find the number of boys in the third class by subtracting the number of boys in the first two classes:
Number of boys in Class 3 = Total number of boys - Number of boys in Classes 1 and 2
Number of boys in Class 3 = 30 boys - 5 boys (Class 1) - 8 boys (Class 2) = 17 boys

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of wolves killed on the previous night as W, and the number of cougars killed on the previous night as C.

From the problem, we have:

1. Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars on the previous night. Therefore, W = 10 and C = 15.
2. Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let x be the number of wolves killed today. Then, x = 3C.
3. Today Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. Let y be the number of cougars killed today. Then, y = C - 3.

We want to find the total number of animals killed today, which is the sum of the number of wolves and cougars.

Total animals killed = x + y

Substituting the expressions for x and y from steps 2 and 3, we get:

Total animals killed = 3C + (C - 3)

Solving for C, we get:

C = (Total animals killed - 3) / 2

Substituting this expression for C back into the equation for total animals killed, we get:

Total animals killed = 3[(Total animals killed - 3) / 2] + [(Total animals killed - 3) / 2] - 3

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator, we get:

2Total animals killed = 3(Total animals killed - 3) + Total animals killed - 6

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2Total animals killed = 3Total animals killed - 3 + Total animals killed - 6

Combining the terms, we get:

2Total animals killed = 4Total animals killed - 9

Subtracting 4Total animals killed from both sides, we get:

-2Total animals killed = -9

Dividing both sides by -2, we get:

Total animals killed = 4.5

However, since the number of animals killed must be a whole number, there is an error in the problem or it is impossible to solve it with the given information.

Therefore, the problem does not have a valid solution. {The final answer is: The problem is not solvable.}</s>","The total number of animals that Rick killed while hunting yesterday is 15+10 = <<15+10=25>>25

He also killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, a total of 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 wolves.
Together, his hunt today yielded 36+12 = <<36+12=48>>48 animals.

1. We have 10 stalls, and Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows.
2. He puts an equal number of new cows into each of the 20 stalls.
3. First, let's determine how many cows go into one stall: Since there are 20 stalls for 40 cows, then each stall gets 2 cow (40/20 = 2).
4. However, Mr. Sylas bought an additional 20 cows (40-20=20) to fill the existing 20 stalls. So, now there are actually 2 cows per stall + 1 cow (for the new cows) per stall, which means there are now 3 cows per stall. (The final answer is:) 3 cows per stall.
5. To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we just multiply the number of cows per stall by the number of stalls in question (8): 3 cows/stall × 8 stalls = 24 cows. (The final answer is:) 24 cows in 8 stalls.</s>","When Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the cows he bought into the stalls, each stall gets 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 new cows.
Each of the stalls gets four cows, meaning a total of 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 cows are placed into eight of the stalls.
Since each stall had 20 cows before Mr. Sylas added four into each of the stalls, the total number of cows in eight of the stalls was 8*20= <<8*20=160>>160 cows.
There are 160+32 = <<160+32=192>>192 cows in eight stalls after Mr. Sylas adds four into each of the stalls.

Step 2: Calculate the monetary value of all the coins:
- Nickels: 40 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $2
- Dimes: 20 dimes * $0.10/dime = $2

Step 3: Add the value of all the coins and dollar bills:
- Value of coins: $2 (nickels) + $2 (dimes) = $4
- Value of dollar bills: 40 * $1/bill = $40
- Total amount in Brady's piggy bank: $4 (coins) + $40 (dollar bills) = $44

{The final answer is: Brady has $44 in his piggy bank.}</s>","Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.
Since nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.
Since a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.
So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.

1. We know that each 10-foot section of redwood tree weighs 400 pounds.
2. To find the weight of the entire tree, we first need to determine the number of 10-foot sections in the tree that is 200 feet tall. We divide the total height of the tree by the height of each section: 200 feet / 10 feet/section = 20 sections.
3. Next, we find the weight of the entire tree by multiplying the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.
4. Now, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to find out how much of the tree's weight they consumed: 8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.
5. To find the weight of the tree after the termites ate away 30% of the wood, we subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the original weight of the tree: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

{The final answer is: The redwood tree weighs 5600 pounds after termites ate 30% of the wood. }</s>","First find how many 10-foot sections are in the redwood: 200 feet / 10 feet/section = <<200/10=20>>20 sections

Then find the amount of the wood the termites ate: 8000 pounds * 30% = <<8000*30*.01=2400>>2400 pounds
Then subtract that amount from the total weight of the wood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = <<8000-2400=5600>>5600 pounds

1. We know that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. Let X represent the number of apples Jamal has, then Andrea has X + 8 apples.
2. We also know that Jamal has half as many bananas as he has apples. So Jamal has X apples, then he has X/2 bananas.
3. We know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So X + (X/2) = X + X/2 = 2X/2 = X + X/2 = 3X/2
4. Setting up an equation, we have 3X/2 = X + X/2, which simplifies to 3X = 2X + 2X, which further simplifies to X = 2X + 2, which doesn't hold true as X cannot equal 2X+2. This indicates that the given information might be inconsistent and no valid solution can be determined from it.

Therefore, no definitive answer can be obtained.

{The final answer is: The information provided is inconsistent, and no valid solution can be determined.}</s>","Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal has 52-8 = <<52-8=44>>44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which totals 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
There are a total of 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 bananas.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the amount of flour needed to make one dozen cookies.
Given that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, we can find the amount of flour needed for one cookie.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of flour needed for today's batch.
Carla is making 36 cookies today, so the amount of flour needed will be:
Flour for today = Cookies for today * Flour per cookie

Step 3: Calculate the amount of flour needed for tomorrow's batch.
Carla is making 30 cookies tomorrow, so the amount of flour needed will be:
Flour for tomorrow = Cookies for tomorrow * Flour per cookie

Step 4: Add the flour needed for both batches to find the total amount required.
Total flour = Flour for today + Flour for tomorrow

The final answer is:
{The final answer is (2/12 * 36 + 2/12 * 30) cups of flour.}

To calculate the final answer, we use the given information that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, so 1/12 of a cup of flour is needed to make one cookie. Then, we can find the amount of flour needed for each batch and add them together.

So, the total amount of flour Carla will need is:
Total flour = (Cookies for today / Cookies per dozen) * Flour per dozen + (Cookies for tomorrow / Cookies per dozen) * Flour per dozen
Total flour = (36 / 12) * 2 + (30 / 12) * 2
Total flour = 3 * 2 + 2 * 2
Total flour = 6 + 4
Total flour = 10 cups

Therefore, Carla will need 10 cups of flour to make the 36 cookies today and the 30 cookies tomorrow.</s>","Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.
Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, then 66 cookies are equal to 66/12 = <<66/12=5.5>>5.5 dozens.
Hence, Carla will need 5.5 x 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 cups of flour.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Convert the number of pennies to dollars. We know that:
1 penny = $0.01

So, the total dollar amount in the cup with 9,300 pennies is:

Total pennies = 9,300
Total dollars = Total pennies * $0.01/penny

Step 2: Find two thirds of the total pennies. To find two thirds of 9,300 pennies, we can multiply the total number of pennies by 2/3:

Two thirds of total pennies = Total pennies * (2/3)

Step 3: Convert the two thirds of pennies to dollars. Since we already have the total number of pennies in dollars, we just need to find the dollars equivalent of two thirds of those pennies:

Two thirds of total dollars = Two thirds of total pennies * $0.01/penny

Now, let's calculate each step:

Step 1: Total dollars = 9,300 * $0.01/penny = $93

Step 2: Two thirds of total pennies = 9,300 * (2/3) = 6,200 pennies

Step 3: Two thirds of total dollars = 6,200 * $0.01/penny = $62

                 [/INST] let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000.
2. He paid transfer fees which is 3% of the selling price, so transfer fees = $400,000 * 0.03 = $12,000.
3. He paid a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, so brokerage fees = $400,000 * 0.05 = $20,000.
4. He also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house.

To find the net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract all the expenses (transfer fees, brokerage fees, and remaining loan) from the selling price:

Net Proceeds = Selling price - Transfer fees - Brokerage fees - Remaining loan
            = $400,000 - $12,000 - $20,000 - $250,000

Now we can calculate the net proceeds:

Net Proceeds = $400,000 - $12,000 - $20,000 - $250,000
             = $388,000

So, Mr. Tan paid a total of $12 000 + $20 000 + $250 000 = $282 000 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.
Hence, Mr. Tan's net proceeds is $400 000 - $282 000 = $118 000.

The oil takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees, we can find the time by multiplying the initial heating time by 1.4 (1 + 0.4, which represents a 40% increase).

Time to heat up to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
Time to heat up to 400 degrees: 20 minutes * 1.4 = 28 minutes

To find the total time it takes for the oil to heat up and cook the chicken, we add the heating time and the cooking time. We are told that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook with the heated oil, so the cooking time is 5 minutes less than the initial heating time:

Time to cook the chicken: 20 minutes (initial heating time) - 5 minutes = 15 minutes

                 [/INST] To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we first need to determine the number of stitches in the body of the sweater, the collar, and the rosette.

1. Body of the sweater: It takes 900 stitches to complete.
2. Collar: It takes a tenth of the number of stitches in the body. So, the number of stitches in the collar is 900 x 0.1 = 90 stitches.
3. Rosette: It takes twice as many stitches as the collar. So, the number of stitches in the rosette is 90 x 2 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's find out the number of stitches in one sleeve. We know that the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. So, the number of stitches in both the body and the sleeves should equal 1800.

Since we have already calculated the number of stitches in the body and the collar, we can find the number of stitches in one sleeve by subtracting the number of stitches in the body and the collar from the total number of stitches in the sweater.

So, the number of stitches in one sleeve is 1800 - (900 + 90*2) = 1800 - 990 = 810 stitches.

We have found that each sleeve takes 810 stitches to knit.

{The final answer is: Each sleeve takes 810 stitches to knit.}</s>","The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.
The rosette takes 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 stitches.
The body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = <<900+90+180=1170>>1170 stitches.
Thus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.
Thus, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = <<630/2=315>>315 stitches.

Step 2: We are also given the cost of one packet of tomato seeds and the cost of one packet of celery seeds.

Step 3: To find the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds, we need to find the cost of the tomato seeds she bought and the cost of the celery seeds she bought, and then add those two amounts together.

Step 4: The cost of tomato seeds per packet is $40, and Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets. So the cost of tomato seeds is 20 x $40 = $800.

Step 5: The cost of celery seeds per packet is $30, and Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets. So the cost of celery seeds is 80 x $30 = $2400.

Step 6: The total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds is the sum of the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

Step 2: Determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize.

- Sean has to memorize 36 lines in the first scene and 96 lines in the second scene, so the total number of lines he has to memorize is 36 + 96 = <<36+96=132>>132.

1. Carly had 80 cards.
2. 2/5 of the cards had the letter A on them, so the number of cards with A is 80 x 2/5 = 128/5 = 25.6 ≈ 26 cards (since there cannot be a fraction of a card).
3. 1/2 of the remaining cards (i.e., 80 - 26 = 54) had the letter B, so there are 54 x 1/2 = 27 cards with B.
4. 5/8 of the remaining cards (i.e., 54) had the letter C, so there are 54 x 5/8 = 35 cards with C.

Now, let's determine how many cards have the letter D:

Total number of cards = 80
Number of cards with A = 26
Number of cards with B = 27
Number of cards with C = 35

To find the number of cards with D:
Total number of cards = Number of cards with A + Number of cards with B + Number of cards with C + Number of cards with D
26 (A) + 27 (B) + 35 (C) + Number of cards with D = 80

Solving for the number of cards with D:

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes. To find this out, we'll find the time it takes to dig one small hole or one large hole and then multiply that by the number of holes needed for each size.

Time to dig 1 small hole = 3 minutes
Time to dig 1 large hole = 10 minutes

Time to dig 30 small holes = (Number of small holes) x (Time to dig 1 small hole)
= 30 x 3
= 90 minutes

Time to dig 15 large holes = (Number of large holes) x (Time to dig 1 large hole)
= 15 x 10

Total time to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes = 90 minutes + 150 minutes

Finally, to find out how many hours it takes to dig all the holes, we'll divide the total number of minutes by 60:

Total time in hours = (Total time in minutes) / (Minutes in 1 hour)

Step 2: From the information given, we have the equation X + Y = 20.

Step 3: Since we need to find their ages in 10 years, we'll first find their current ages and then add 10 years to each.

Step 4: To find their current ages, we can solve the equation X +Y = 20 for either X or Y. We'll solve for X:

X = 20 - Y

Now that we have their ages expressed in terms of one variable Y, we can find their ages in 10 years by adding 10 to the current ages and solving for the new Y value.

Step 5: In 10 years, Mico's age will be X + 10, and Marco's age will be Y + 10.

Step 6: To find the new Y value, we can substitute X = 20 - Y and X = 20 + 10 - Y into the original equation and solve for Y:

(20 - Y) + (Y + 10) = 20

Step 7: Solving this equation, we get Y = 10.

Step 8: Now that we have Y, we can find Mico's age in 10 years: X = 20 - Y = 20 - 10 = 10.

Step 9: In summary, Mico's age will be 10, and Marco's age will be 20 + 10 = 30 in 10 years.

1. We know that Ruby is ! 6 times older than Sam, so we can write the equation R = S + 6.

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the equation R + 9 = 3S.

3. Now we have two equations with two variables. Let's solve this system of equations.

4. Substitute the expression R = S + 6 from the first equation into the second equation, getting 3S + 6 + 9 = 3S.

5. Simplify the equation: 3S + 6 + 9 = 3S => 3S + 15 = 3S => 15 = 0S, which is not a valid equation since the left side is always a multiple of 3S and the right side is always 15.

6. This system of equations does not have a unique solution. Therefore, there can be multiple valid ages for Sam and Ruby, given the information provided.

Since there is no definitive answer, the question does not have a final answer.</s>","Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.
In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
We simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.
Now we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of popsicles.
Peter bought 20 popsicles, and each popsicle cost $0.25.
Cost of popsicles = Number of popsicles * Cost per popsicle
Cost of popsicles = 20 * $0.25
Cost of popsicles = $5

Step 2: Calculate the cost of ice cream bars.
Peter bought 4 ice cream bars, and each ice cream bar cost $0.50.
Cost of ice cream bars = Number of ice cream bars * Cost per ice cream bar
Cost of ice cream bars = 4 * $0.50
Cost of ice cream bars = $2

Step 3: Find the total cost.
Total cost = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars
Total cost = $5 + $2
Total cost = $7

{The final answer is: Peter paid $7 in total.}</s>","The popsicles cost 0.25*20=<<0.25*20=5>>5 dollars.
The ice cream bars cost 0.5*4=<<0.5*4=2>>2 dollars.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of spots on a cobra and a mamba.
Given that a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has twice as many spots, we can find out how many spots a mamba has:

1. A cobra has 70 spots.
2. A mamba has twice as many spots as a cobra.
3. So, a mamba has 70 × 2 = 140 spots.

Step 2: Find out how many snakes of each type there are in the snake park.
We're given that there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of spots on all snakes in the park.

1. Cobras have 70 spots each.
2. There are 40 cobras.
3. So, the total number of spots on cobras is 70 × 40 = 2800.
4. Mambas have 140 spots each.
5. There are 60 mambas.
6. So, the total number of spots on mambas is 140 × 60 = 8400.

Step 4: Calculate the sum of spots on all snakes.
Total number of spots = Spots on cobras + Spots on mambas = 2800 + 8400 = 11,200.

Step 5: Find half the total number of spots.
Half the total number of spots = Total number of spots / 2 = 11,200 / 2 = 5,600.

{The final answer is: Half the number of spots all the snakes have combined is 5,600}.</s>","A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba, meaning a mamba has 70/2= <<70/2=35>>35 spots.
If there are 40 cobras in a snake park, they all have a total of 70*40 = <<40*70=2800>>2800 spots.
60 mambas in a snake park, each having 35 spots, have 60*35 = <<60*35=2100>>2100 spots total.
Together, all the snakes in the park have 2100+2800=<<2100+2800=4900>>4900 spots.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of people Maddy will be feeding.
- Each team member brings 2 guests: 1 team member × 2 guests = 2 guests per team member
- There are 12 team members: 12 team members × 2 guests = 24 guests for team members
- There are 3 coaches: 3 coaches × 0 guests (coaches don't bring guests) = 0 guests for coaches
- So in total, there will be 24 guests for team members and 0 for coaches = 24 guests

Step 2: Calculate the number of pizzas needed to feed everyone.
- Each pizza serves 3 people: Number of pizzas = Total number of people / Number of people per pizza
- Total number of people = 24 guests, so Number of pizzas = 24 guests / 3 people/pizza = 8 pizzas

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the pizzas.
- Each pizza costs $15, so Total cost = Number of pizzas × Cost per pizza

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of topaz gemstones per necklace.
Each necklace contains 8 topaz gemstones.

Step 2: Calculate the length of each topaz gemstone.
Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.

Step 3: Find the length of each sterling silver bead.
Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long.

Step 4: Calculate the total length of the necklace.
Each necklace is 25 inches long.

Step 5: Determine the length of the sterling silver beads needed to fill the space between the topaz gemstones to make up the difference between the total length of the necklace and the combined length of all the topaz gemstones.

First, calculate the length of all the topaz gemstones: 8 * 1 inch = 8 inches.

Then, find the difference between the total length of the necklace and the combined length of all the topaz gemstones: 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.

Now, calculate the number of sterling silver beads needed to fill this space: 17 inches / 1/4 inch = 68 beads.

Since each bead covers the space between two gemstones, there are 7 beads between each pair of gemstones. Therefore, there are 7 additional beads per necklace for each gap between the first and last gemstones (5 gaps * 7 beads).

Hence, the total number of sterling silver beads per necklace is: 8 * 7 + 68 = 56 + 68 = 124.

{The final answer is 124 sterling silver beads}</s>","8 topaz gemstones, at 1 inch per gemstone, contribute a total of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 inches to each necklace.
Since each necklace is 25 inches in length, then there are 25-8=<<25-8=17>>17 inches of space between gemstones.
Since Katerina uses one-quarter inch sterling silver beads to fill space between gemstones, then she will require 17*4=<<17*4=68>>68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

1. We know that there are three rows with 8 stars.

II. Next, we know that there are two rows with 6 stars.

III. Now we need to find the number of rows with 5 stars. Let's find the total number of stars on the flag first, and then subtract the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

IV. The flag has 76 stars in total.

V. Each 8-star row has 8 * 8 = 64 stars. Hence, there are 3 such rows with 64 * 3 = 192 stars.

VI. Each 6-star row has 6 * 2 = 12 stars. Hence, there are 2 such rows with 12 * 2 = 24 stars.

Step 2: Next, we need to determine how many trips the trucks can make with their weight limit.
2000 pounds (weight limit of one truck) / 6000 pounds (weight of 80 flagstones) = 1/3
Since a truck can't make a third of a trip, we'll need to round up and get two trucks for one full load.

Step 3: Finally, we'll find out how many trips are needed to transport 80 flagstones and then multiply that by the number of trucks needed for one trip to find the total number of trucks needed.
Number of trips = 80 flagstones / (weight each truck can carry in one trip) = 80 / 6000 = 0.013333...

Speed of car in slow lane =Speed of car in fast lane / 2
Speed of car in slow lane = 60 miles/hour / 2
Speed of car in slow lane = 30 miles/hour

Now, to find out how long it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover a distance of 480 miles, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

So,

Time for car in slow lane = Distance / Speed
Time for car in slow lane = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour

To find the time in hours, we need to divide both the numerator and denominator by 60 (since time is usually given in hours and minutes or hours and seconds):

Time for car in slow lane = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour

1. Ali has won 22 medals for counting.
2. Izzy has won 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 17 medals (22-5).
3. Together, they have 10 times fewer medals than the total number of medals given out.

Let's denote the total number of medals given out as X. We know that 22 (Ali's medals) + 17 (Izzy's medals) = 39, and their medals combined are 10 times fewer than the total number of medals X. So, we can write this equation: 39 < 10 * X.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are required for the adults and children in total. The adults receive 6 bars each, so:
   number_of_bars_for_adults = 4 (adults) × 6 (bars per adult) = 24 bars
2. Since there are a total of 4 adults and 8 children, there are 12 people in total. The 24 bars for the adults leave us with an unknown number of bars needed for the children:
   24 (bars for adults) + ? (bars for children) = 8 (packets of 5 bars each) × 5 (bars per packet)
3. Let x be the number of bars for the children. Then, we can set up the equation:
   24+x = 40
4. Solving this equation, we find that x = 16. So the children will receive a total of 16 chocolate bars.
5. To find out how many chocolate bars each child will receive, we divide the total number of chocolate bars for the children by the number of children:
   number_of_bars_per_child = 16 (bars for children) / 8 (children) = 2 bars per child

{The final answer is that each child gets 2 chocolate bars.}</s>","Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars so 8 packets contain a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 bars
Each adult gets 6 bars so 4 adults will get 6*4 = <<6*4=24>>24 bars in total
There are now 40-24 = <<40-24=16>>16 bars left
16 bars are shared equally among 8 children, so each child will get 16/8 = <<16/8=2>>2 bars

Step 2: She works for a total of 3 hours between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. Converting hours to minutes, we have 3 hours * 60 minutes = 180 minutes.

Step 3: She takes a pause for half an hour, which is 30 minutes. Subtracting the pause from her total work time, she works for 150 minutes (180 minutes total - 30 minutes pause).

Step 4: To calculate her earnings, we can find out how much she earns in one minute, and then multiply that by the number of minutes she works.

Step 5: She earns $5 every 10 minutes, which means she earns $0.5 ($5 / 10) every minute.

Step 6: To find her total earnings, multiply her earnings per minute by the number of minutes she works: $0.5/minute * 150 minutes = $75.

{The final answer is $75}</s>","Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.
So she works 2.5 * 60 = <<2.5*60=150>>150 minutes
She earns $5 per 10 minutes, so for the online task she earns in total 150 * 5/10=$<<150*5/10=75>>75.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

Step 4: Mike stays with 21 points (since he already had more than 20 points).

1. First, we need to find out how many oranges the sons will wash. To do this, we need to find the number of oranges each son will wash based on their ages.
   
   - The oldest son is 8 years old.
   - The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 4 years old.

2. We know that each son washes as many oranges as they are in years, so the oldest son washes 8 oranges and the youngest washes 4 oranges.

3. Since we know that Will bought 15 oranges, and the sons washed 12 (8 from the oldest and 4 from the youngest), we can find out how many oranges are left unwashed.

   The final answer is: 15 (oranges Will bought) - 12 (oranges washed by the sons) = {3 oranges left unwashed}</s>","The older son washes 8 oranges, so the younger son washes 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.

Step 2: Determine the number of push-ups on the second day.
- On the second day, he does 20 more push-ups than on the first day, so:
- Push-ups on the second day = 100 (on the first day) + 20

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of rice consumed by one person per day.
Since there are two meals (lunch and dinner), the amount of rice consumed by one person in one day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of rice consumed by the household per day.
The household has 5 members, so the amount of rice consumed by the household per day is 0.4 kg/person * 5 persons = 2 kg.

Step 4: Calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice lasts.
A 42 kg bag of rice lasts for 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days.

Step 5: Calculate how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice lasts.
21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks.

Step 2: Calculate the number of crates Sam sold on other days.
Sam was closed on Monday and Friday. Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. So, the number of crates Sam sold on weekdays other than Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday is 0 (he was closed). The number of crates Sam sold on the weekend is 20.

                 [/INST] Step 1: The opening bid for the antique desk is $200.
Step 2: Carmen bids $50 more each time she bids.
Step 3: There are 3 other people bidding once each time.

Let X be the number of times Carmen bids before she wins the auction. We want to find the value of X and the total cost of the desk for Carmen.
Each time Carmen bids, the price goes up by $50. So, the price after Carmen bids i times is:
200 + 50i

The first time someone else bids, the price is $250. So, the other people bid after Carmen bids i times, where i is a positive integer. Therefore:
250 = 200 + 50i
50i = 50
i = 1

This means that the other people bid for the first time when the price was $250, and Carmen bid before that. So, Carmen bids a total of i + 1 = 2 times before she wins.

To find the value of X, note that the other people bid after Carmen bids i times, and the next time they bid, the price is $50 more. Therefore, the difference in the prices when the other people bid must be a multiple of $50:
250 = 200 + 50i => 50i = 50
=> i = 1

So, the other people bid for the first time when Carmen bid for the second time. The first time Carmen bid was when the price was $200. Therefore, Carmen bids a total of X = 2 + 1 = 3 times before she wins (once initially, and twice when the other people bid).
Since the price is $50 more each time Carmen bids, the total cost of the desk for Carmen is:
200 + 50(3) = 200 + 150 = $350.

{The final answer is: $350}</s>","3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

John goes to work 5 days a week and his work is 30 miles away. So, he drives 30 miles each way, which totals 60 miles per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total miles John drives each year.
He drives this distance each week for 50 weeks a year, so he drives 60 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 3,000 miles/year.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of driving miles.
John gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the cost of driving every mile is $2/mile.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of driving miles annually.
The cost of driving 3,000 miles annually is $2/mile * 3,000 miles = $6,000.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the monthly bonus.
John gives his driver a $150 bonus each month, so the cost of the monthly bonus is $150/month.

The cost of the annual bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

Step 7: Calculate the total cost of driving annually.
The total cost of driving annually, including both the cost of driving miles and the monthly bonus, is $6,000/year + $1,800/year = $7,800/year.

1. On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.
2. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes.
3. To find the total amount of time Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday, we need to add the time he spent exercising on Monday and Sunday and then double that amount:

Total exercise time = (Time on Monday) + (Time on Sunday) × 2
Total exercise time = (16 minutes) + (23 minutes) × 2
Total exercise time = 16 minutes + 46 minutes
Total exercise time = 62 minutes

Step 2: Each page, except for possibly the first and the last ones, is printed on both sides. This means that for a 32-page tabloid, we have 30 pages with content (since the first and the last pages are typically not printed on the back).

Step 3: Since we fold the paper vertically, the left and right sides become the front and back sides, respectively, when the paper is unfolded.

Step 4: For a 30-page tabloid with content on both sides, we'll need an even number of sheets because of how the folds work. If we have an odd number of pages, we'll have an extra half-page that we can eliminate by imagining the last page overlapping with the previous sheet a bit around its edges. Since we have 30 pages, we'll need an extra half-page.

Step 5: To calculate the number of sheets needed, we'll divide the number of pages by the number of pages per sheet, taking into account that we have an extra half-sheet for the overlap. Since the half-sheet will not increase the total number of content pages, the number of sheets required for the tabloid remains the same.

Step 6: Given that the content on each side of a single sheet consists of two pages, the total number of pages on a single sheet is 4 (two pages on the front and two pages on the back).

The final answer is: To create a 32-page tabloid, you would need {17} sheets of paper (since 32 pages / 2 pages/sheet = 16 sheets * 1.5 sheets/page = 17 sheets).</s>","Each piece prints 4 pages.
Then 32/4=<<32/4=8>>8 pieces of paper would be used.

                 [/INST] To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine how many books she sold in the second year. According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Let's find out how many books that was, and then find out how many books she sold in the second year.

Let's denote the number of books she sold in the first year as x. Then, the number of books she sold in the current year is x/2. Given that there are currently 50 unsold books, the number of books she has sold in total over the three years is x + 50. Since there are 250 books in total, and there are 200 books left unsold, the number of books she has sold is 200 less than the total number of books.

200 = x + 50
x = 150

So, in the first year, she sold 150 books. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, she sold 300 books in the second year.

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is 300 books * $20/book = $<<300*20=6000>>6000.

{The final answer is $6000.}</s>","If her sales in the current year are 45, she sold 45*2 = <<45*2=90>>90 books in the first year.
The total number of books sold in the first and current year is 90+45 = <<90+45=135>>135.
The total number of books sold in the second year is 250 of the original number of books - 135 sold books - 50 unsold books = <<250-135-50=65>>65 books.
If each book sells at 20$, then she earned 20*65 = $<<20*65=1300>>1300 in the second year

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate Watson's weekly salary without the bonus.
Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so his weekly hours are 10 hours/day * 5 days/week * 7 days/week = 350 hours/week.
His hourly wage is $10/hour, so his weekly salary without the bonus is 350 hours/week * $10/hour = $3,500/week.

Step 2: Calculate Watson's monthly salary with the bonus.
To calculate his monthly salary, we need to know how many weeks there are in a month. April has 4 weeks and 3 days, or approximately 22 working days (assuming weekends are not worked).
Since Watson works 5 days a week, he works 5 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 20 days/month.
Watson's monthly salary without the bonus is 20 days/month * 350 hours/day = $7,000/month.
With the bonus, his monthly salary is $7,000/month + $300/week * 4 weeks = $7,300/month.

Step 3: Calculate Watson's wage for April with the bonus.
To calculate Watson's wage for April, we can multiply his monthly salary by the number of weeks in April.
There are 4 weeks and 3 days in April, so the number of working days in April is 4 weeks * 5 days/week + 3 days = 21 working days.
Watson's wage for April is 21 working days * $7,300/month = $151,700/month.

However, the question asks for the answer in dollars, not dollars and cents. Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is $151,700}</s>","In a day, Watson makes 10 * 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100
If he works five days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 5 * 4= <<5*4=20>>20 days.
Since he makes $100 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 20 * 100= $<<20*100=2000>>2000.
He also got a 300 * 4 = $<<300*4=1200>>1200 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of April.
At the end of April, he earned 2000 +1200 = $<<2000+1200=3200>>3200.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the given information.
- The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

Step 2: Find out how many loaves are sold in the morning.
- Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, so:
Number of loaves sold in the morning = (2/3) * Total loaves
Number of loaves sold in the morning = (2/3) * 60
Number of loaves sold in the morning = 40

Step 3: Find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening combined.
- Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, so:
Number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening = (1/2) * (Total loaves - Sold in morning)
Number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening = (1/2) * (60 - 40)
Number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening = 10

Step 4: Determine how many loaves are sold in the afternoon specifically.
- Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in both the afternoon and evening, we need to find the ratio of loaves sold between those two time periods.
- Let's assume X loaves are sold in the afternoon and Y loaves are sold in the evening.
- We know X + Y = 10 (Total loaves sold in afternoon and evening)
- With some simple reasoning, we can figure out that X = 5 (since the question asks for the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, not the difference in the number of loaves sold between afternoon and evening)

Step 5: State the final answer.
{The final answer is: 5 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.}

Continuous improvement remark
By assuming X = 5, we indirectly confirmed the given statement which assumes that ""half"" of the remaining loaves is split equally between afternoon and evening. However, if we were to focus more on the reasoning and less on assumptions, we could have solved this problem without making any assumptions. To do so, we would need to calculate the exact number of loaves remaining after morning sales and then determine how many are sold in each half of the day separately. This method is more accurate and less prone to errors.

For a more accurate calculation:
Step 3: Instead of assuming the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening, we can find exact numbers:
Total loaves remaining = Total loaves - Sold in morning = 60 - 40 = 20
Number of loaves sold in the second half of the day (afternoon and evening) = Total loaves remaining / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10
Finally, since there is a 3-hour gap between morning and afternoon sales, we can assume that half of those loaves are sold in both the afternoon and evening sessions (as per the initial question's assumption). So, there are 5 loaves sold in the afternoon.

The revised final answer: {The final answer is: 5 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.}</s>","60 x 2/3 = <<60*2/3=40>>40 loaves of bread are sold in the morning.
60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon and evening.
Therefore, 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

Given information:
- Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks

First, let's find out how much weight Joey loses per week:

Weight loss per week for Joey = Total weight loss / Number of weeks
Weight loss per week for Joey = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight loss per week for Joey = 2 pounds per week

Now that we know Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight:

Weeks needed for Sandy to lose the same weight = Total weight loss for Sandy / Weight loss per week for Sandy
Weeks needed for Sandy to lose the same weight = (Weight loss for Sandy) / 2 pounds per week

We don't have a specific weight loss target for Sandy in the problem, so let's assume that Sandy wants to lose the same 8 pounds as Joey:

Weeks needed for Sandy = 8 pounds / 2 pounds per week
Weeks needed for Sandy = 4 weeks

So, based on the given information, it would take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in a week.

{The final answer is: It would take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in a week.}</s>","Joey loses 8 pounds / 4 weeks = <<8/4=2>>2 pounds per week.
In order to match Joey, Sandy should lose 2 pounds / 4 = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 of a pound per week.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the saving from the sale of one tub of ice cream.
The price of one tub of ice cream was originally $13, but it was sold for $11. Therefore, the saving from the sale of one tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.

Step 2: Determine the saving from the discount on one packet of milk.
One packet of milk was sold at a discount of $0.5. So, the saving from the discount on one packet of milk is $0.5.

Step 3: Calculate the total saving from buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.
The saving from one tub of ice cream is $2 and the saving from one packet of milk is $0.5. Therefore, the total saving from buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk would be $2 * 2 (for the two tubs of ice cream) + $0.5 * 4 (for the four packets of milk) = $4.5 in total.

{The final answer is $4.5.}</s>","The discount for each tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $<<13-11=2>>2.

- Extra arms: 15 days / 3 days = 5 arms per three-day interval
- Extra legs: 15 days / 5 days = 3 legs per five-day interval

Step 3: Multiply the number of intervals by the number of new limbs per interval to find the total number of new limbs.
- New arms: 5 arms/interval × 5 intervals = 25 arms
- New legs: 3 legs/interval × 5 intervals = 15 legs

Step 4: Add the number of new arms and new legs to find the total number of new limbs.

Step 1: Calculate Theo's expenses for business suits and suitcases.
The cost of 6 business suits is $100 each, so the total cost is 6 * $100 = $600.
The cost of 3 suitcases is $50 each, so the total cost is 3 * $50 = $150.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of a flight ticket.
We know that the cost of a flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. So, the cost of a flight ticket is 5 * $100 + $700 = $600 + $700 = $1300.

Step 3: Determine Theo's total expenses and savings.
Theo's total expenses for the trip are the costs of business suits, suitcases, and a flight ticket, which is $600 + $150 + $1300 = $2010. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so his total expenses plus savings are $2010 + $2000 = $4010.

Step 4: Find out how much Theo can spend on gifts.
To find out how much Theo can spend on gifts, we need to subtract his total expenses and savings from the amount of money he has, which is $6000. So, $6000 - $4010 = $2030.

Total eggs consumed in a day = 9 (from step 1) + 4 (from step 2) = <9+4=13> 13 eggs.

step 4: Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week.
We know there are 7 days in a week, so we can calculate the total number of eggs consumed in a week as:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. This means that Noah's age was half of Cera's age at that time. So, Noah's age = (1/2) * Cera's age.

Step 2: Cera is currently 46 years old. Substitute this value into the equation from Step 1 to find Noah's age six years ago.

Noah's age six years ago = (1/2) * 46 = 23 years

Step 3: The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. Let P represent the current population of Chile, and P_old represent the population six years ago. Thus, P_old = (1/2) * P

Step 4: We know that the population six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Substitute the value of Noah's age six years ago from Step 2 into this equation.

3000 * 23 = P_old

Step 5: Solve for P_old by multiplying 3000 and 23.

P_old = 69,000

Step 6: Find the population of Chile now by multiplying the population six years ago by 2.

P = 2 * 69,000 = 138,000

Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, meaning Noah was 1/2*40 = 20 years.
If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, there were 3000*20 = <<3000*20=60000>>60000 people living in chile.
Since the population of Chile was half what it was now six years ago, currently Chile has 60000*2 = <<60000*2=120000>>120000 people

                 [/INST] Let's call the number of players on the defense ""d."" According to the problem, there are twice as many players on offense, so there are 2d players on offense. Also, there are half as many players on special teams as on defense, which means there are d/2 players on special teams.

We know that the total number of players is 105, so we can set up the following equation:

d + 2d + d/2 = 105

To solve for d, we can first find the sum of the number of players on offense and special teams:

2d + d/2

Multiply the term with ""d"" by 2 to make the denominators match:

2d + d/2 = 2d + 2d/2

Simplify:

3d/2 = 105

Now, we need to find the common factor of 3 and 105 to get rid of the fraction:

3 * d / (2 * 35) = 1

Therefore, d = 35 * 2 = 70.

Now that we have the number of players on offense, we can find the number of players on defense:

Total players = Players on offense + Players on defense + Players on special teams
105 = 2d + d + d/2

Subtract d from both sides:

105 = 2d + d + d/2
105 = 3d + d/2

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

210 = 6d

Divide both sides by 6 to find the value of d:

d = 35

So, there are 35 players on defense.

{The final answer is: There are 35 players on the defense.}</s>","Let x represent the number of players on the defense

She invited 3 families with 4 people each: 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 people

Step 2: Determine how many people couldn't attend.
Mentioned were 8 people who couldn't come: illness - no number mentioned, previous commitments - 1/4 of the invited.
Since there are 12 people in each family type (total: 12+12=<<12+12=24>>24), 1/4 of them is: 24 / 4 = <<24/4=6>>6 people.
So, there are 12 people who couldn't attend due to illness and 6 people who couldn't attend due to previous commitments.
Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't attend is: 12 + 6 = <<12+6=18>>18 people.

Step 3: Determine the total number of people who can attend the party.
Number of invited people: 12 (families with 6) + 12 (families with 4) = <<12+12=24>>24

Given:
- A classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys.
- There are 30 boys in the classroom.
- The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as it has boys.

Step 2: Find the number of girls in the classroom.
Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, then:
Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Step 3: Find the number of nongendered children.
Since there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, and there are 30 boys, then:
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * Number of boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3 boys

Wait a minute, something is not right with the last calculation. The number of nongendered children should be different from boys. Let's check the problem and make sure the numbers are correct.

Assuming the number of nongendered children is indeed different from boys, then the problem should read ""1/10 as many nongendered children as there are ______ boys"" or ""1/10 as ______ children as boys"".

Let's redo the calculation under this assumption:

Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * Number of boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3 * 3 = 9

Step 4: Find the total number of children in the classroom.
Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 9 = 139

Since we can't have 0.5 people, we'll assume that some people left in groups of half, or that some people left after the hour mark. In any case, 7 people left, so 23 (30 - 7) people remained at the party.

Step 3: The problem asks How many women are left if 22 men stayed at the party? However, since we previously found that 23 people remained at the party, there are actually 23 women as well because there were 30 people in total, and 22 men remain.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of pencils Jam has in her boxes.
Since Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and there are 26 pencils in total (including the loose ones), we can calculate the number of pencils in each box:

Number of pencils in each box = Total number of pencils - Number of loose pencils
Number of pencils in each box = 26 - 2 = 24 pencils

Step 2: Calculate the number of pencils Jam has in her boxes.
Number of pencils in Jam's boxes = Number of boxes * Pencils per box
Number of pencils in Jam's boxes = 3 boxes * 24 pencils/box = 72 pencils

Step 3: Determine the number of pencils Meg has.
Meg has 46 pencils.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together.
Total number of pencils = Pencils in Jam's boxes + Pencils Meg has
Total number of pencils = 72 pencils + 46 pencils = 118 pencils

Step 5: Calculate the number of boxes needed to store Jam and Meg's pencils.
Assuming each box can hold the same number of pencils as before (24 pencils), we can determine the number of boxes needed:

Number of boxes needed = Total number of pencils / Pencils per box
Number of boxes needed = 118 pencils / 24 pencils/box ≈ 5 boxes

Since Jam already has 3 full boxes, they would need an additional 2 boxes to store all their pencils.

{The final answer is: Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.}</s>","There are a total of 26 - 2 = <<26-2=24>>24 pencils in the three boxes.

                 [/INST] To find out how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is after it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effects of cooling and adding ice cubes, cooling with ice cubes and adding cream separately.

First, let's see how many milliliters weaker the coffee becomes when one ice cube is added:
Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker.

Let x be the number of ice cubes Shannon adds to her coffee. Then the total number of degrees the coffee is cooled and the total number of milliliters it is weakened are given by:

Total degrees cooled = 13x
Total milliliters weakened = 12x

Now we need to find out how many ice cubes Shannon adds to her coffee to cool it by 65 degrees. We have:

Total degrees cooled = 13x
65 = 13x
x = 5.15

Since we cannot add a fraction of an ice cube, Shannon will use 6 ice cubes to cool her coffee by approximately 65 degrees. Therefore, the coffee will be cooled by:

6x = 6 * 13 = 78 degrees

And it will be weakened by:
6x = 6 * 12 = 72 milliliters

However, we have not accounted for the cooling that occurs when the ice cubes melt. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker, after melting it will contribute an additional 12 milliliters of water to the coffee, which also weakens it. So we should add 6 * 12 = 72 milliliters to the total number of milliliters the coffee is weakened.

Thus, the total number of milliliters the coffee is weakened after cooling by 65 degrees and adding 6 ice cubes is:

Total milliliters weakened = 72 + 72 = 144

Finally, let's see how the 15 milliliters of cream Shannon adds affect the final volume of her iced coffee. Adding cream increases the volume of the coffee without diluting it, so we do not need to account for it in our calculations. Therefore, the final answer is {Her iced coffee is 144 milliliters weaker after cooling it by 65 degrees and adding 6 ice cubes and 15 milliliters of cream}.</s>","Shannon’s iced coffee has 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes in it.
The ice makes the coffee 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 milliliters weaker.

How many old ! records did the ; 5 ! people ? bring in?
                 [/INST] To find out how many old records the 5 people brought in, we can use the given information about the number of old and new records they left with.

1. We know that for every 2 old records people bring in, they get 1 new record.
2. Each of the 5 people came in with old records and left with new records.
3. They each left with 7 new records.

To find out how many old records they brought in, we first need to figure out how many new records they left with. According to the problem, they each left with 7 new records.

Since they got 1 new record for every 2 old records they brought in, we can set up a ratio of 2 old records to 1 new record. We know they had 7 new records each, so we can set up the following equation:

2 old records :: 1 new record

Given that they had 7 new records each, we can find out how many old records they brought in by setting up the proportion:

2 old records / 1 new record = 7 new records / x old records

Cross-multiplying the above ratio gives,

2 * x = 7

Solving for x, we get x = 3.5

Since we cannot have half a record, this means that the five people brought in an incorrect number of records according to the given problem. If we assume they brought in the correct number of old records, then each person would have brought in 3.5 * 2 = 7 old records, or 14 old records in total. However, this would not leave them with the indicated 7 new records each.

Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of old records the 5 people brought in according to the provided information. {The final answer is: We cannot determine the exact number of old records the 5 people brought in with the given information.}</s>","People can bring in 2 old records = get 1 new record.
5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records, 7 new records x 2 old records traded for each = <<7*2=14>>14 old records that the 5 people brought in.

                 [/INST] To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to find out how many junior and senior programmers there are, and then find their respective monthly salaries and add them up. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. We know that the company has employed 100 people in total.
2. Junior programmers make up 2/5 of the total number of employees.
3. So, there are 2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers (since 2/5 * 100 = 80, and we rounded down to 40).
4. Senior programmers make up the remaining 3/5 of the total number of employees.
5. Therefore, there are 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.
6. Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
7. Senior programmers are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month (since they are paid $400 more).
8. So, the total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.
9. And the total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.
10. Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is that the company pays a total of $224,000 per month to all the programmers.</s>","The number of junior programmers in the company is 2/5*100 = <<2/5*100=40>>40
The total amount of money that the company pays to the Junior employees is $2000*40 = $<<2000*40=80000>>80000
There are also 100-40 = <<100-40=60>>60 senior programmers in the company.
The senior programmers are paid $2000+$400 = $<<2000+400=2400>>2400 each.
Senior programmers at the company receive 2400*60 = $<<2400*60=144000>>144000 combined.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of people who got on or off the bus at each stop.
- At the first stop, 5 people got on.
- At the second stop, 7 people got down (left the bus) and 8 people got on.

Step 2: Find out how many people were already on the bus before the first stop.
We know that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people. We also know that 5 people got on at the first stop and 8 people got on at the second stop. Therefore, 13 people were already on the bus before the first stop (20 people total - 5 people who got on at the first stop - 8 people who got on at the second stop).

Step 3: Find out how many people got on at the terminal.
Since 13 people were already on the bus before the first stop, and there were 5 people who got on at the first stop and 8 people who got on at the second stop, we can find out how many people got on at the terminal by subtracting the number of people already on the bus before the first stop from the total number of people who got on the bus.

Total number of people who got on the bus = 5 (first stop) + 8 (second stop) + ? (terminal)
We are given that at the third stop there were 20 people, so there were 13 people already on the bus before the first stop, and 5 more got on at the first stop and 8 more got on at the second stop. Therefore, the number of people who got on at the terminal is:

? = 20 (total people at third stop) - 13 (people already on bus before first stop) - 5 (people who got on at first stop) - 8 (people who got on at second stop)
? = 20 - 13 - 5 - 8
? = 0
However, this answer doesn't make sense in the context of the problem as it indicates that no one got on the bus at the terminal. However, we know from the problem statement that some people got on the bus at the terminal.

At this point, it is unclear what the correct answer is, as there seems to be a discrepancy between the information given in the problem statement and the mathematical calculations performed.</s>","There were 20 - 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 people on the bus before 8 people got in at the second stop.
There were a total of 12 + 7 =<<12+7=19>>19 people at the second stop before 7 people went down.
So, 19 - 5 = <<19-5=14>>14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school: 24 - 2 = 22.
2. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends, so now he has: 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
3. On the way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops. Adding these to the ones he has left: 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, which brings the count down to: 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning: 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

- The cell phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point every 3 minutes.
- The cell phone is currently at 60% charged.

Step 2: Determine how long it takes to charge 1 percentage-point.
Since the cell phone gains 1 percentage-point every 3 minutes, the time it takes to charge 1 percentage-point is 3 minutes.

Step 3: Find out how long it takes to fully charge the cell phone.
To find the total time required to charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we need to find out how many 3-minute intervals it takes. Since we charge the cell phone by 1 percentage-point each interval:

Number of intervals = Total percentage-point increase ÷ Percentage-point increase per interval
Number of intervals = (100% - 60%) ÷ 1%
Number of intervals = 40% ÷ 1%
Number of intervals = 40

Step 4: Multiply the number of intervals by the duration of each interval to find the total charging time.
Charging time = Number of intervals × Duration of each interval
Charging time = 40 intervals × 3 minutes per interval
Charging time = 120 minutes

Step 5: Convert the charging time from minutes to hours.
We know that:
1 hour = 60 minutes

Charging time in hours = Charging time in minutes ÷ Minutes per hour
Charging time in hours = 120 minutes ÷ 60 minutes

Step 6: Present the final answer.
{The final answer is 2 hours}</s>","100-60=<<100-60=40>>40 percentage points.

The customer earned $1 off for every $20 spent. In this shopping trip, they spent $43. So, the rewards earned are:
$1 off per $20 spent * $43 spent = $2.15

Step 2: Calculate the amount of discount given by the rewards.
The rewards took twice the amount off the price. So, the discount given is:
$2.15 rewards * 2 = $4.30

Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent excluding the rewards and coupons.
The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip and $43 on this shopping trip. So, the amount spent excluding rewards and coupons in this shopping trip is:
$80 (last shopping trip) + $43 (this shopping trip) - $2.15 (rewards earned) = $125.15

Step 4: Calculate the final amount paid by the customer in this shopping trip.
The customer paid exactly the amount spent excluding rewards and coupons in this shopping trip less the rewards discount. So, the final amount paid is:

Given: Hourly wage is $15, and hours worked are 2000 in a year.
First, let's find out the gross annual salary: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year.

Next, lets calculate the tax amount: $30,000/year * 0.2 = $6,000/year.
So the annual salary after tax is $30,000/year - $6,000/year = $24,000/year.

Step 2: Calculate the net annual salary for Job B.
Given: Annual salary is $42,000/year, and property tax is $6,000/year.

First, we find the taxable income: $42,000/year - $6,000/year = $36,000/year.
Next, we calculate the tax amount: $36,000/year * 0.1 = $3,600/year.

Finally, the net annual salary after tax is $42,000/year - $6,000/year (property tax) - $3,600/year (income tax) = $32,400/year.

Step 3: Compare the difference between Job A and Job B's net annual salaries.
The difference in net annual salary is $32,400/year (Job B) - $24,000/year (Job A) = $8,400/year.

{The final answer is: Nick will make an additional $8,400/year at Job B compared to Job A.}</s>","First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000

Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400

Ruined castles = Total castles * Percentage of ruined castles
 Ruined castles = 220 * 0.4
 Ruined castles = 88

Step 3: Half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we multiply the number of ruined castles by half:

For Furniture United's offer:
Total cost = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Installment amount)
Total cost = $1,350 + (6 * $350)
Total cost = $1,350 + ($2,100)
Total cost = $2,450

For Cozy Homes' offer:
Total cost = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Installment amount)
Total cost = $1,100 + (9 * $250)
Total cost = $1,100 + ($2,250)
Total cost = $3,350

Next, we need to find out how many guns each person would have if they were to share their guns equally. We can do this by finding the total number of people and then dividing the total number of guns by the number of people:

Number of guns per person = Total number of guns / Number of people
Number of guns per person = 24 / 4

                 [/INST] To find out how much sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge, we first need to find out how many ounces of sugar are required for each type of batch. So, let's calculate the sugar amount for one batch of suckers and one batch of fudge.

One batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
One batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.

Now, we need to find out how much sugar Mason requires for making 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

Since 1 batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar, the sugar requirement for 8 batches would be:

Sugar for 8 batches of suckers = 30 ounces/batch × 8 batches
Sugar for 8 batches of suckers = 240 ounces

And since 1 batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar, the sugar requirement for 1 batch of fudge would be:

Sugar for 1 batch of fudge = 70 ounces/batch × 1 batch
Sugar for 1 batch of fudge = 70 ounces

To find the total sugar amount required, we add the sugar amounts for all 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge:

Total sugar needed = Sugar for 8 batches of suckers + Sugar for 1 batch of fudge
Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces
Total sugar needed = 310 ounces

{The final answer is 310 ounces of sugar is needed to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge}.</s>","First find the total sugar needed for the suckers: 30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = <<30*8=240>>240 ounces

                 [/INST] Step 1: Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each. So, the total amount Maria spends on buying the shares is:
8 shares * $8/share = $64

Step 2: The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. We need to find out how much each share is worth after the first year.
Initial stock value = $8
Increase in stock price = $8 * 0.5 = $4
New value of one share = Initial stock value + Increase = $8 + $4 = $12

Step 3: The number of shares Maria holds after the first year remains the same. So, the total value of her shares after the first year is:
Total value after first year = New value of one share * Number of shares = $12 * 8 = $96

Step 4: The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. We need to find out how much the new value of one share will be after the second year.
Decrease in stock price = $12 * 0.25 = $3
New value of one share = New value after first year - Decrease = $12 - $3 = $9

Step 5: The total value of Maria's shares after the second year is:
Total value after second year = New value of one share * Number of shares = $9 * 8 = $72

Step 6: The difference between the total value of Maria's shares after the first year and the second year is:
Difference in total value = Total value after first year - Total value after second year = $96 - $72 = $24

The final answer is: The final value of all Maria's shares is $96 after the first year, and $72 after the second year, with a difference of $24. {So the final value of all Maria's shares is $96 + $24 = $110.}</s>","First find the initial total value of Maria's purchase: 8 shares * $8/share = $<<8*8=64>>64

Add that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: $64 + $32 = $<<64+32=96>>96
Then multiply that amount by 25% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: $96 * 25% = $<<96*25*.01=24>>24

Size of each larger group = Total number of students / Number of groups (in this case, 2)
Size of each larger group = 200 students / 2 groups = 100 students

Now we know that the smallest group has 10 less students than each of the larger groups. So, the size of the smallest group is:

Size of smallest group = Size of larger group - 10 students
Size of smallest group = 100 students - 10 students = 90 students

{The final answer is: There are 90 students in the smallest group.}</s>","If 10 is added to the smallest group (hence to the total number of students), it would make all 3 groups equal to give (200+10)/3 = <<(200+10)/3=70>>70 in each group.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as K.
Step 2: We know that Brown has 60 animals in total, so we have the equation: C + K = 60.
Step 3: We also know that he has twice as many chickens as cows, so we have the equation: C = 2K.
Step 4: Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:
    C + K = 60
    C = 2K
Step 5: We can solve this system by substitution. Let's substitute C = 2K in the first equation:
    2K + K = 60
Step 6: Combine like terms: 3K = 60
Step 7: Divide both sides by 3 to find the value of K: K = 20
Step 8: Once we have the value of K, we can find the value of C by substituting it back: C = 2(20) = 40
Step 9: Each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs. So the total number of legs in the farm is:
    2(number of chickens) * 2 + 4(number of cows) * 4
Step 10: Substitute C = 40 and K = 20 in the equation:
    2(40) * 2 + 4(20) * 4 = 80 * 2 + 80 * 4 = 160 * 2 = 320

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. We have three animals with known weight differences from the pink frog:
   - A blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog.
   - A green toad weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake.
   - A yellow snake is 20 pounds more than a red bird.
2. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
3. We need to find the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal.

First, let's find the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird:

- Since the pink frog and the blue beetle weigh the same, and the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
- The yellow snake is 20 pounds more than a red bird, and the pink frog is 20 pounds more than a red bird (as stated later in the problem), so the yellow snake and the red bird have the same weight, which is 30 pounds less than the pink frog's weight.
  - This means the red bird weighs 30 - 20 = 10 pounds. Since the yellow snake and the red bird have the same weight, the yellow snake also weighs 10 pounds + 10 = 20 pounds.
- The green toad weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the green toad weighs 20 pounds - 10 = 10 pounds.

Now we can find the total weight of the container:

- The weight of the pink frog is 50 pounds.
- The weights of the other animals are already determined: 50 pounds (pink frog), 20 pounds (yellow snake), 10 pounds (green toad), and 10 pounds (red bird).
- To find the total weight of the container, sum the weight of each animal: 50 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 90 pounds.

{The final answer is 90 pounds.}</s>","Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.
The pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.
If you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.
The pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.
All the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds

Step 2: Her mom gave her an additional 15 baby outfits.

Step 3: To find the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we need to add the number of outfits she received from her friend, the number of outfits she received at the baby shower, and the number of outfits her mom gave her.

Step 4: Laurel received x outfits from her friend, 2x outfits from the baby shower, and 15 outfits from her mom.

Step 5: To find the total number of outfits, we can add x, 2x, and 15: x + 2x + 15 = 3x + 15

Step 6: To find the value of x, we can subtract 15 from 3x, then divide the result by 3: x = (3x + 15) / 3 = x + 5/3

Step 7: Since x represents the number of outfits her friend gave her, and her friend gave her 24 outfits, we can set up the equation x = 24 and solve for x: x = 24

Step 8: Now that we know the number of outfits her friend gave her (x = 24), we can find the total number of outfits she has by adding the number of outfits she received from her friend, the number of outfits she received at the baby shower, and the number of outfits her mom gave her: x + 2x + 15 = 2x + 24 + 15 = 4x + 39 = 5(4x + 7.8)

Step 9: Dividing both sides by 5, we get: x + 1.96 = 4x/5

Step 10: Solving for x, we get x = 5/3 \* (x + 1.96)

Step 11: Substituting x = 24, we get 5/3 \* (24 + 1.96) = 5/3 \* 25.6 = 50.2

Step 12: Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a baby outfit, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, giving us 51 outfits.

3. Juice Box C costs $ (11.5 - 4.5) = $7 dollars more than Juice Box A.
4. Since Juice Box B costs $0.5 more than Juice Box A, we can find the difference between their prices as follows:
   - Difference between Juice Box B and Juice Box A = $ (4.5 - 4) = $0.5
5. To find the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we add the differences we've calculated:
   - Difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box A = $7
   - Difference between Juice Box B and Juice Box A = $0.5
   - Therefore, the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B = $7 + $0.5 = $7.5

Final answer: Juice Box C is $7.5 more expensive than Juice Box B. {The final answer is: Juice Box C is $7.5 more expensive than Juice Box B}</s>","Juice Box B is 4+5 = <<4+5=9>>9 dollars.

- Davos bought 2 shirts from the mall.
- Each shirt costs $30.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the shirts without any discount.

Cost of 2 shirts = Number of shirts * Cost of each shirt
Cost of 2 shirts = 2 * $30
Cost of 2 shirts = $60

Step 3: Find out the discount percentage.

Discount = 40%

Step 4: Calculate the amount of discount Davos got.

Discount amount = Cost of shirts * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $60 * 0.4
Discount amount = $24

Step 5: Subtract the discount amount from the original cost of the shirts to find out the final price Davos paid.

Final price = Cost of shirts - Discount amount
Final price = $60 - $24
Final price = $36

Step 6: Present the answer.

{The final answer is: Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts after the 40% discount.}</s>","The total price of the 2 shirts is $30 x 2 = $<<30*2=60>>60.

When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day, and the price was $100 per tractor. So, the daily revenue from tractors was 10 * $100 = $1000.

Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue from making and selling silos.
Now, they sell 5 silos a day, and they make $220 per silo. So, the daily revenue from silos is 5 * $220 = $1100.

Step 3: Find the difference between the current daily revenue and the previous daily revenue.
The difference in daily revenue is $1100 (current) - $1000 (previous) = $100.

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the total number of hours Peyton spends on after-work activities each day:

1. Monday: 1 hour yoga class = 1 hour.
2. Tuesday: Cooking class = 3 hours (specified as ""3 times as long as Monday's yoga""). So, 3 * 1 hour = 3 hours.
3. Wednesday: Half-hour cheese-tasting event = 0.5 hours.
4. Thursday: Museum tour = 0.5 hours (specified as ""half as long as the cooking class""). So, 0.5 * 3 hours = 1.5 hours.
5. Friday: 2 hours errands.

Now let's add up the hours for all days:

Total Hours = Hours on Monday + Hours on Tuesday + Hours on Wednesday + Hours on Thursday + Hours on Friday

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many plant pots April bought for daisies and roses. She bought 30 plant pots for daisies and twice as many for roses.

Number of plant pots for roses = Number of plant pots for daisies * 2
Number of plant pots for roses = 30 * 2 = 60 plant pots

Therefore, April bought a total of 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 plant pots for the school garden.

Next, we need to subtract the number of plant pots that April already bought before she knew how many she needed. She bought 100 plant pots previously.

So, the number of plant pots April has left = 90 (for the school) + 100 (already bought) - 190 (total plant pots bought) = <<190-90-100=0>>>0

It seems that there is a mistake in the question, as the calculation above results in a negative number of plant pots left over, which doesn't make sense.

Andrea saved some money, spent the rest on an $11 sweater, and gave $4 to her brother. If Andrea had $36 in the beginning, how much did she save?

Step 2: Identify the known and unknown variables
We know that Andrea spent $11 on a sweater and gave $4 to her brother. We also know that she had $36 in the beginning. The unknown variable is the amount of money Andrea saved.

Step 3: Find the difference between the initial amount and the total amount spent
To find the amount Andrea saved, we need to find the difference between the initial amount and the total amount spent on the sweater and her brother.

Let's calculate the total amount spent: $11 (sweater) + $4 (brother) = $15

Step 4: Find the difference between the initial amount and the total amount spent
The difference between the initial amount and the total amount spent is the amount Andrea saved: $36 (initial amount) - $15 (total amount spent) = $21

Step 5: Verify the answer
To verify the answer, let's double-check the calculations:

1. We know that Andrea had $36 in the beginning.
2. She spent $11 on the sweater, leaving her with $25.
3. She gave $4 to her brother, leaving her with $21.

- There are three trees in Eddy's backyard: let 'x' be the height of the shortest tree, 'y' be the height of the middle tree, and 'z' be the height of the tallest tree.

Step 2: Use the given information to form equations:
1. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet: x = 6
2. The middle tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree: y = x + 5
3. The tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined: z = 2(x + y)

Step 3: Solve for the variable 'z' (the height of the tallest tree):
First, we need to find the height of the middle tree 'y'. We know x = 6 and y = x + 5, so substituting x with 6, we have: y = 6 +5 = 11.

Now, we have x = 6 and y = 11. We can use these values to find z: z = 2(x + y) = 2(6 + 11) = 2 * 17 = 34.

So, {The final answer is the tallest tree is 34 feet tall}.</s>","The height of the second tree is 6 + 5 = <<6+5=11>>11 feet.

His ! mother ; then . feels : generous and ? decides to ; give : him an extra ? $10. How : much ; money . does ? Dean have ; left?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears that Dean bought with the initial $28 from his mother.

Cost of toys cars = Number of toy cars * Cost per toy car
= 6 * $2
= $12

Cost of teddy bears = Number of teddy bears * Cost per teddy bear
= 5 * $1
= $5

Step 2: Find the total cost of toys that Dean bought.

Total cost of toys = Cost of toy cars + Cost of teddy bears
=$12 + $5
=$17

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Dean had before his mother gave him an extra $10.

Money before extra cash = Initial amount given - Cost of toys
=$28 - $17
=$11

Step 4: Add the extra $10 given by his mother.

Total amount of money Dean has now = Money before extra cash + Extra cash
=$11 + $10
=$21

{The final answer is: Dean has $21 left.}</s>","The cost of the toy cars is 6 cars × $2/car = $<<6*2=12>>12.
The cost of the teddy bears is 5 bears × $1/bear = $<<5*1=5>>5.
The total cost of the toys is $12 + $5 = $<<12+5=17>>17.
Adding the two amounts of money his mother gave him, we find that Dean has $28 + $10 = $<<28+10=38>>38 to spend.
Dean has $38 − $17 = $21 left.

                 [/INST] To find out how many friends Morgan can invite while sticking to her $90 budget for her birthday party, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. Cost for one round of mini-golf: $5
2. Cost for arcade tokens for herself and her friends: $5
3. Cost for one go-kart ride: $10
4. Number of go-kart rides for Morgan: 2

First, let's calculate the total cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends:

Mini-golf Cost = Number of Friends × Cost per round

Let N be the number of friends.

Cost = N × $5

Next, let's calculate the total cost of go-kart rides for Morgan:

Go-kart Cost = 2 × $10

Go-kart Cost = $20

Now we'll find the total cost of the party by adding the cost of mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-kart rides:

Total Cost = Mini-golf Cost + Arcade Cost + Go-kart Cost

Total Cost = (N × $5) + (N × $5) + $20

Total Cost = ($10N) + $20

Since Morgan has a $90 budget for the party, we can set up the equation:

$90 = ($10N) + $20

To find N, we need to subtract $20 from $90 and then divide the result by $10.

$10N = $88

N = $88 / $10

N = 8.8

Since we can't invite a fraction of a person, we need to round this value down to account for the fact that she wants to make sure all her friends get to participate in activities without having any ""leftover"" budget.

The final answer is {Morgan can invite 8 friends to her party}.</s>","The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20
Each person costs $30 because 5 + 5 + 20 = <<5+5+20=30>>30
Three total people can attend because 90 / 30 = <<90/30=3>>3
She can invite 2 friends because 3 - 1 =<<3-1=2>>2

Marisa buys 4 lollipops every day, each worth 25 cents. So, she spends $0.10 on lollipops each day.

Step 2: Calculate how much money Marisa receives from her parents every day.
Marisa receives $5 every day from her parents.

Step 3: Calculate how much change Marisa has each day after buying lollipops.
Change = Money received - Money spent on lollipops
Change = $5 - $0.10
Change = $4.90

Step 4: Calculate how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank after 5 days.
Money saved = Change per day * Number of days
Money saved = $4.90 * 5
Money saved = $24.50

The final answer is: {Marisa saves $24.50 in her piggy bank after saving for 5 days}.</s>","If each lollipop costs 25 cents, 4 lollipops cost 4 * 25 cents = <<4*25=100>>100 cents

If ! he bought ? 40 gumballs, , how ; many pounds of ? candy : did he buy?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate how many pounds of candy Billy bought with his $10:
We know that each pound of candy costs $1.5. To find out how many pounds Billy was able to buy with $10, we set up the equation:

$10 = x × $1.5

Solving for x, we get:

x = $10 / $1.5
x = $10 ÷ $1.5
x = 7 pounds

So, Billy bought 7 pounds of candy.

Step 2: Calculate how many gumballs Billy bought with half of his change:
First, we need to find out how much change Billy had left after buying 7 pounds of candy. Since the candy cost $1.5 per pound, and Billy spent $10, we can calculate the change as:

Change = $10 - $7
Change = $3

Then, we know that Billy spent half of his change on gumballs. Each gumball costs $0.05, so we can calculate how many gumballs he bought:

Number of gumballs = (Change / Price per gumball) × 100
Number of gumballs = ($3 / $0.05) × 100
Number of gumballs = 600 / 5
Number of gumballs = 120

Step 3: Find the relationship between the number of pounds of candy bought and the number of gumballs purchased:
We know that the cost of 1 pound of candy is $1.5, and each gumball costs $0.05. Let's find the total cost of the candy and gumballs Billy bought:

Total cost = Cost of candy + Cost of gumballs
Total cost = $7 + ($0.05 × Number of gumballs)

We already know that Billy bought 120 gumballs, so let's find the total cost of those gumballs:

Cost of gumballs = $0.05 × Number of gumballs
Cost of gumballs = $0.05 × 120
Cost of gumballs = $6

Now we can find the total cost, which should equal the change Billy had after buying the candy:

Total cost = $7 + $6
Total cost = $13

Since Billy had $3 as change after buying the candy, and the total cost of the candy and gumballs he bought is $13, we can conclude that Billy actually spent the entire initial $10 on candy and did not have any money left for gumballs.

Therefore, the problem as stated is incorrect or inconsistent, and the final answer cannot be determined based on the given information.</s>","He spent $2 on gumballs because 40 x .05 = <<40*.05=2>>2
He had $4 in change because 2 / .5 = <<2/.5=4>>4
He spent $6 on candy because 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6
He bought 4 pounds of candy because 6 / 1.5 = <<6/1.5=4>>4

                 [/INST] Step 1: Carver has turned 45 years old.

Step 2: The difference between Carver's age and his son's age is 5 years.

Step 3: Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. Let X be the age of Carver's son. then we have: X = Carver's age - 5 and Carver's age = 2X - 5

Step 4: Solve for X by making Carver's age the subject and setting the equation up as a quadratic equation (2X - 5 = X + 5), we can solve for X as follows:
X = 2X - 5 + 5
X = 2X
X = X + 5
X = X + 5 - 2X
X = 3X - 5
X = (3X - 5) / (3 - 1)
X = 2X - 5 / 2
X = (2X - 5) / 1
X = 2X - 5
X = X + 5
X = 3X
X = 3X - 5
X = 3(X - 1) (subtracting 1 from X to make the computations easier)
X = 3(X - 1)
X = 3X - 3
X = X + 3
X = 4X - 3
X = 4X - 3 + 5
X = 4X + 2

Step 5: Divide both sides by 4 to find X:
X = (4X + 2) / 4
X = X + (2/4)
X = X + 1/2
X = 2X + 1
X = 2(X + 1/2)
X = 2X + 1 + 1/2
X = 2X + 2
X = 2(X + 1)
X = 2X + 2 - 2
X = 2X
X = X + 2
X = 3X
X = 3X - 2
X = 3(X)
X = 3X
X = 3X/3
X = X

X = 45 + 2 = 47

{The final answer is: Carver's son is 47 years old.}</s>","Let x be the age of Carver's son.
Since Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, then 45=(2*x)-5.
Add 5 to each side of the equation and we get 50=2*x.
Thus, the age of Carver's son is x=25 years old.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled by the train in one trip.
The train goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city and 100 miles from the second city to the third city. So, the total distance is: 75 + 100 = 175 miles.

Step 2: Determine how many miles the train covers before needing service.
The train needs service every 18,000 miles. Since the total distance covered in one trip is only 175 miles, the train covers this distance multiple times before needing service. To find out how many trips it makes before needing service, divide the total miles to service by the distance covered in one trip: 18,000 / 175 = 103.21. Since the train can't make a fraction of a trip, it would make 103 trips of 175 miles each, and the total distance covered before needing service is 18,000 miles.

Step 3: Calculate how many days the train goes between services.
Since the train covers 18,000 miles before needing service, and its trips consist of 75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles, and it makes 3 trips a day, the train covers 3 * 225 = 675 miles per day. To find the number of days, divide the total miles to service by the daily distance: 18,000 / 675 ≈ 26.67. Since the train can't go for a fraction of a day, it would go 27 days between services.

The final answer is: The train can make 27 days worth of trips between services.</s>","It takes 100+75=<<100+75=175>>175 miles for the first two legs of the trip

So the total trip is 175+125=<<175+125=300>>300 miles
So it goes 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 miles per day
So it can go 18000/900=<<18000/900=20>>20 days between services.

- Chihuahua bed: 2 pounds
- Collie bed: Not explicitly stated, but the average amount between a Chihuahua bed and a Rottweiler bed is given.

Step 2: Find the amount of stuffing needed for one Rottweiler bed.
- A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.

Step 3: Determine the amount of stuffing needed for one Collie bed.
- The average amount of stuffing between a Chihuahua bed and a Rottweiler bed is given.
- Let's assume the difference in stuffing between a Chihuahua and Collie bed is X.
- So, Chihuahua bed = 2 pounds, Rottweiler bed = 8 pounds, and Collie bed = 2 + X.
- The average difference between a Chihuahua and Collie bed is (8 - 2) / 2 = 3.5.
- Therefore, X = 3.5 * 6 = 21.
- So, Collie bed = 2 + 21 = 23 pounds.

John drives 200 miles at a speed of 70 mph. The time it takes to travel a certain distance depends on both the distance and the speed. We can find the time by using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

So, the time John took to drive to his friend's house without the detour is: Time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2 hours and 42.86 minutes (approximately).

Step 2: calculate the distance John drove with the detour
John drove 200 miles without the detour and took a detour that added 10 miles, so the total distance driven was 210 miles.

Step 3: Calculate the time it took for the entire trip, considering the different speed for the return trip.
The trip to his friend's house took 2 hours and 42.86 minutes. The return trip was 240 miles, and John traveled at a speed of 80 mph. We can again use the Time = Distance / Speed formula.

The time John took to drive back home is: Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours, so the total time for the entire trip would be: 2 hours and 42.86 minutes (for the trip to the friend's house) + 3 hours (for the return trip) = 5 hours and 42.86 minutes.

Step 2: Calculate the minimum number of points Jane needs to earn on the third test to pass with a total of at least 42 points.
The total number of points Jane needs to obtain is 42, and she has already earned 33 points from the first two tests. Therefore, she needs to earn at least 9 more points on the third test.

Minimum points needed on the third test = Total points needed - Points earned from the first two tests

                    3 ; customers ! were ? kicked out ; of the ? Walmart . for refusing to wear masks. . A ? number ! equals to , four times that many minus 5 were kicked ? out for shoplifting.  .

Walmart, ! how . many were : kicked ? out for ; other reasons?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that there were 3 customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks. Let's denote this number as x.
2. Four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks (4x) were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. Since we know there were 5 shoplifters (from the information about shoplifting), we have 3 * 5 = 15 customers kicked out for physical violence.
4. The total number of people kicked out of Walmart was 50. So we have x (refusing to wear masks) + 4x (shoplifting) + x (physical violence) + other reasons.
5. We can set up an equation and solve for the number of people kicked out for other reasons: x + 4x + x +other = 50 => 6x+other = 50 => other = 50-6x
6. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we need to find x, the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks. Since we know there were 3 of them, and there were 4 times as many shoplifting, we have x:3::4x:5. Solving this proportional relationship gives x:3=4x:15, which means x = 3/4 * 15 = 7.5. Since it's not possible to have 0.5 customers, we need to check if there might be an error in the problem statement. If there is no error, we have found an inconsistency in the given information, and no distinct number of customers were kicked out for other reasons.

{The final answer is, the given information is inconsistent and no distinct number of customers were kicked out for other reasons based on the given information.}</s>","First quadruple the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks: 4 * 3 customers = <<4*3=12>>12 customers
Then subtract 5 from this number: 12 customers - 5 customers = 7 customers
Then triple that number to find the number of people kicked out for violence: 7 customers * 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 customers
Then subtract the number of customers kicked out for each known reason to find the number kicked out for other reasons: 50 customers - 3 customers - 21 customers - 7 customers = <<50-3-21-7=19>>19 customers

                 [/INST] To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points and having three times as many points as Sara, who scored 8 points, let's follow these steps:

1. Find out how many points Sara has in total.
Sara's points = 8

2. Find out how many points Erin has now, which is three times as many as Sara's points.
Erin's points = 3 * Sara's points
Erin's points = 3 * 8
Erin's points = 24

3. Since we want to find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to find out how many points she scored before reaching the point where she had three times Sara's points.

Let x represent the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points. After scoring 14 points, her total points would be x + 14. We know she had three times Sara's points after that, so:

x + 14 = 3 * Sara's points
x + 14 = 3 * 8
x + 14 = 24

Now we need to isolate the variable x.

x = 24 - 14
x = 10

Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.

Step 2: Find the additional cost for etching the logo on each frame.
Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% of the cost. So, the additional cost per frame is 0.2 * $20 = $<<0.2*20=4>>4.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for each senior's picture frame with etching.
Cost of picture frame with etching = Cost of picture frame + Additional cost for etching
Cost of picture frame with etching = $20 + $4
Cost of picture frame with etching = $<<20+4=24>>24

Step 4: Find the cost of pins for 2 seniors.
2 seniors will also receive pins that are $5 each.
Cost of pins for 2 seniors = $<<5*2=10>>10

Step 5: Find the cost of cords for 1/4 of the seniors.
1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each.
Cost of cords for officers = $12 * Number of officers
Cost of cords for officers = $<<12*0.25=3>>3 * 44
Cost of cords for officers = $<<12*0.25*44=104.8>>104.8
This number is not rounded since the result is to be added to other costs.

Step 6: Calculate the total cost for all seniors' gifts.
Total cost for all seniors' gifts = Cost of picture frames for all seniors + Cost of pins for 2 seniors + Cost of cords for officers
Total cost for all seniors' gifts = $24 * 44 + $10 + $104.8
Total cost for all seniors' gifts = $<<24*44+10+104.8=1352.4>>1352.4

Ethan can save 20% on the cost when he does it himself.

Step 3: Find out how much Ethan can save by making his own wallpaper.
To find out how much Ethan can save, we need to find 20% of the cost of hand-painted wallpaper.

Cost of hand-painted wallpaper = $400
Savings = 20% of $400

Savings = 0.2 * $400 = $80

Step 4: Find out the total cost for Ethan when he makes his own wallpaper.
To find out the total cost for Ethan, we need to subtract the savings from the cost of hand-painted wallpaper.

Step 3: On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount they sold the day before. So they sold 1/2 * 28 = 14 pairs on Sunday.

Step 4: However, six pairs were returned by customers because the shoes didn't fit.

Step 5: To find the total number of pairs sold at the end of the sale, we need to add the number of pairs sold on each day and subtract the number of pairs returned.

Total number of pairs sold = Pairs sold on Friday + Pairs sold on Saturday + Pairs sold on Sunday - Pairs returned

The company bought equipment worth $400,000 from a retailer. Out of this equipment, 40% were faulty. The company returned the faulty pieces to the seller. We need to find out how much the company spent on functioning pieces of equipment.

Step 2: Calculate the value of faulty equipment
20% of the total equipment was faulty. So, the value of faulty equipment is 20% of $400,000:

Faulty Equipment = Total Equipment * Percentage of Faulty Equipment
Faulty Equipment = $400,000 * 0.4
Faulty Equipment = $160,000

Step 3: Calculate the value of functioning equipment
The value of functioning equipment is the total value of the equipment minus the value of the faulty equipment:

Functioning Equipment = Total Equipment - Faulty Equipment
Functioning Equipment = $400,000 - $160,000
Functioning Equipment = $240,000

2. Mary gets 1 kg of milk from 15 sheep every day, so the milk collected from one half of her flock is:
   = 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep
   = 15 kg/day

3. From the other half of her flock (15 sheep), Mary collects 2 kg of milk every day, so the milk collected from that half is:

2. Next, let's find out how many pupils remain after the blue-likers have been counted: Total number of pupils = 40, and we've counted 20 blue-likers, so there are 40 - 20 = <<40-20=20>>20 pupils remaining.
3. Then, we count the number of pupils who like green: One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so 20 pupils * 0.25 = <<20*0.25=5>>5 pupils like green.
4. Now, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils to find out how many pupils like yellow: Total number of pupils = 40, we've counted 20 blue-likers and 5 green-likers, so there are 40 - 20 - 5 = <<40-20-5=15>>15 pupils who like yellow.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of apples picked on Monday as x. We know that Lucy sold x apples on Monday and made $56 from these sales. So, we have:

x = number of apples picked on Monday
$56 = $4 * x (since each apple is sold for $4)

Now, we need to find the number of apples picked on Tuesday (y) and Wednesday (z).

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 less apples than she did on Monday:
y = x - 12

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked the previous day:
z = 2 * (x - 12)

Our goal is to find the total number of apples picked over the three days, so let's calculate x, y, and z:

First, we'll solve for x from the second equation:
x = $56 / $4 = 14 * $56 / $4 = 36 * $14 = 528 / 4 = 132

Now, we can calculate y and z:
y = x - 12 = 132 - 12 = 120
z = 2 * (x - 12) = 2 * (132 - 12) = 2 * 130 = 260

So, the number of apples picked on each day is as follows:

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Lindsay is doing the laundry and she thinks she has missed some socks.
2. There are 50 pairs of socks that need washing.
3. If Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks and 15 loose socks, how many socks in total does she have?

First, let's find out how many socks Lindsay has washed. We know that 10 pairs of socks equal 20 socks (1 pair = 1 sock), and 15 loose socks are 15 socks. So, Lindsay has washed 20 + 15 = <ins>35 socks</ins>.

Since Lindsay initially had 50 pairs of socks, which is equivalent to 100 socks, and she has washed 35 socks, then <b>the number of socks she has missed</b> is 100 - 35 = <ins>65 socks</ins>.

Therefore, {The final answer is: Lindsay has missed 65 socks.}</s>","Splitting the pairs shows there were 10 pairs of socks * 2 socks/pair = <<10*2=20>>20 socks paired together.
This means she has washed a total of 20 paired socks + 15 loose socks = <<20+15=35>>35 socks.
She has therefore missed 50 socks – 35 socks = <<50-35=15>>15 socks.

Step 4: We need to find out how many cookies are left for Rachel. To do this, we subtract the number of cookies her brother ate from the total number of cookies Rachel initially had.

Step 5: Initial cookies (Rachel) = 23
Step 6: Cookies given by Janet = 42
Step 7: Cookies eaten by brother = 44

Step 8: Total cookies Rachel had = 23 (hers) + 42 (given) = 65
Step 9: Cookies Rachel's brother ate = 44

                 [/INST] To find the monthly payment for Karan's loan, we can use the formula for calculating monthly payments for a loan with a constant interest rate:

Monthly Payment = Loan Amount * (Monthly Interest Rate) / (1 - Power of Monthly Interest Rate raised to the power of Number of Payments)

Given:
- Loan Amount: $3,650
- Number of Months: 5
- Monthly Interest Rate: 10%/12 (monthly interest rate is an annual rate divided by 12) = 0.083333

First, calculate the Power of Monthly Interest Rate:
Power of Monthly Interest Rate = 1 + Monthly Interest Rate
Power of Monthly Interest Rate = 1 + 0.083333
Power of Monthly Interest Rate ≈ 1.0834

Next, find the number of payments (total number of months):
Number of Payments = Number of Months
Number of Payments = 5

Now, calculate the monthly payment:
Monthly Payment = Loan Amount * (Monthly Interest Rate) / (1 - Power of Monthly Interest Rate raised to the power of Number of Payments)
Monthly Payment = $3,650 * (0.083333) / (1 - 1.0834^5)
Monthly Payment = $3,650 * (0.083333) / 0.527080771

Step 2: Calculate the total distance hiked by Chloe.
Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours.
Total distance hiked by Chloe = Speed * Time
Total distance hiked by Chloe = 9 km/h * 5 h
Total distance hiked by Chloe = 45 kilometers

Step 3: Find the difference in total distance hiked between Cho and Chloe.

Millie sells each cup for $1. So her hourly sales in dollars are 4 cups/hour * $1/cup = $<<4*1=4>>4/hour.

Step 4: Calculate Millie's profit per hour.
To calculate her profit per hour, subtract her hourly costs (which are covered by her hourly sales) from her hourly sales.

                 [/INST] First, let's make the question clear by correcting the spelling errors and formatting. We'll assume that Mr. Rutherford sold 3/5 of his land, leaving him with 12.8 hectares.

Step 1: Find out how much land Mr. Rutherford sold.
Let X be the amount of land Mr. Rutherford had at first. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, we can find the amount of land he sold as follows:

Land sold = 3/5 * X

Step 2: Determine how much land is left.
We know that Mr. Rutherford has 12.8 hectares left after selling some land. Thus,

Land left = X - Land sold
 => X - 3/5 * X = 12.8

Step 3: Solve for X.
To find the initial amount of land Mr. Rutherford had, we can use the equation from Step 2 and solve for X:

X - 3/5 * X = 12.8
 => X = 12.8 * (1 + 3/5)
 => X = 12.8 * (8/5)
 => X = 17.28 hectares

So, {The final answer is 17.28 hectares}.</s>","Mr. Ruther is left with 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.
Since 2/5 is equal to 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 is equal to 12.8/2 = <<12.8/2=6.4>>6.4 hectares.
Hence, Mr. Ruther had 6.4 x 5 = <<6.4*5=32>>32 hectares of land at first.

50% of the 52 members are boys, so:
Number of boys = 0.5 * 52
Number of boys = 26

50% of the 52 members are girls, so:
Number of girls = 0.5 * 52
Number of girls = 26

Step 2: Calculate the original number of people who could perform.
Total number of people who could perform = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of people who could perform = 26 + 26
Total number of people who could perform = 52

Step 3: Determine the number of people who performed on the day.
On the day, 50% of the people could perform, but half of them couldn't make it. So the actual number of people who performed is:
50% of the total number of people who could perform
Performing people = 0.5 * 52
Performing people = 26

Step 4: Add the three teachers who joined the performance.
Total number of people who sang in the performance = Performing people + Teachers
Total number of people who sang in the performance = 26 + 3
Total number of people who sang in the performance = 29

The final answer is: 29 people sang in the performance.</s>","The 50 person choir is 50% female, so if the performance is just women there will be 52/2=26 people performing.

Divide the sum of the test scores by the number of tests (5): 316 / 5 = 63.2

Step 2: Round up or down to meet the minimum requirement
Since Wilson needs a math grade of 80 or higher for the weekend, we need to check if rounding the average up or down will meet this requirement.

Rounding up: 63.2 rounded up is 64.

Rounding down: 63.2 rounded down is 63.

                    question:
                    Monica is ! wrapping ? Christmas ; gifts. She ! has 6 gifts to wrap for , her . family, 4 gifts , to wrap . for : her friends and 2 , gifts , to wrap for her teachers. : She has 144 ? inches ? of ribbon and : wants : to ; make ! a . bow for each gift ? with it. , How . many ? inches , of ribbon , can , she use , for ? each gift ; bow?
                 [/INST] First, let's determine how many gifts Monica is wrapping in total. We know she is wrapping gifts for her family, friends, and teachers, so:

Total number of gifts = Gifts for family + Gifts for friends + Gifts for teachers
Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12

Next, we need to find out how much ribbon is required for each gift bow. We're given that Monica has 144 inches of ribbon and she wants to make a bow for each gift. So, the amount of ribbon required for one bow is:

Ribbon for one bow = Units of ribbon for one bow (to be determined)

To find the units of ribbon for one bow, we need to make some assumptions. Typically, a gift bow is wider than it is tall since it is intended to cover the largest part of a gift’s surface area. Therefore, let's assume the shape of the bow is approximately circular since circles can represent the largest two-dimensional shape.

The area of a circle can be calculated with the formula:

Area of a circle = π * r²

We don't know the exact size of Monica's gift bows, so we'll represent the diameter of a bow with the variable d and find its radius using the formula r = d / 2. The ribbon length for one bow (measured in the circumference of the circle) would be 2 * π * r. In order to find the required length of ribbon for one bow, we first need to determine the diameter.

Let's assume that the diameter of one bow is reasonable for wrapping a gift, say, around 5 inches. This would lead to a diameter of 10 inches since the diameter is twice the radius.

r = d/2 = 10 inches / 2 = 5 inches

Now, let's calculate the length of ribbon for one bow:

Ribbon for one bow = 2 * π * r = 2 * π * 5 inches = 31.4 inches (approximately)

Since Monica's ribbon is given in inches and she has 144 inches, we will check if she has enough ribbon for wrapping all her gifts and making bows:

Total ribbon needed for 12 gifts = 12 * Ribbon for one bow = 12 * 31.4 inches = 376.8 inches

Lastly, the total ribbon length that Monica has is 144 inches. Hence, we can see that Monica doesn't have enough ribbon to make a bow for each gift using the dimensions we've assumed. Based on these dimensions, she would need 376.8 inches, which is more than what she has. To adjust, Monica can make smaller bows, use thinner ribbon, or find a way to cover the entire gift with a single bow, requiring less ribbon in total.

Therefore, with the given information, Monica cannot wrap every gift with a bow using the 144 inches of ribbon provided.

The final answer is: Monica cannot wrap each gift with a bow using the given ribbon length.</s>","Monica is has 6 gifts for family + 4 gifts for friends + 2 gifts for teachers = <<6+4+2=12>>12 gifts to wrap.
Her ribbon can be divided equally 144 inches of ribbon / 12 gifts = <<144/12=12>>12 inches of ribbon per gift.

                 [/INST] To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has based on the given ratio of 5:6.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as x. Then the number of popsicles Sam has is (5/6)*x.

We know that their total number of popsicles is 165, so:

x (Betty) + (5/6)*x (Sam) = 165

To solve this equation, we can first find the value of (5/6)*x for Sam:

(5/6)*x = 165 * (1/6)
(5/6)*x = 27.5
x = 27.5 * (6/5)
x = 36

So Betty has 36 popsicles. Thus,

Sam's popsicles = (5/6)*x = (5/6)*36 = 60

Now, we need to find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty:

More popsicles for Sam = Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles
                                  = 60 - 36
                                  = 24

{The final answer is: Sam has 24 more popsicles than Betty.}</s>","The total ratio representing the number of popsicles that Betty and sam have is 5+6 = <<5+6=11>>11.
Since Betty has 5/11 of the total number of popsicles they have together, she has 5/11*165 = <<5/11*165=75>>75 popsicles.
Sam has 165-75 = <<165-75=90>>90 popsicles.
Sam has 90-75 = <<90-75=15>>15 more popsicles than Betty.

                 [/INST] To find out how much money Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription and getting streaming services instead, we need to calculate the cost of each streaming service individually and then find the savings from canceling the cable package.

1. The cost of Netflix is $10 a month.
2. The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus when purchased separately is $10 a month each, so the total cost is $10 + $10 = $20 a month.
3. Tim saves 20% when bundling Hulu and Disney Plus, so the cost of the bundle is $20 * (1 - 0.2) = $20 * 0.8 = $16 a month.
4. The cost of the cable package is $60 a month.
5. Tim cancels the cable subscription and starts paying for Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus. His monthly cost with the streaming services is $10 + $16 = $26 a month.
6. The savings from canceling the cable subscription is the difference between the monthly cost of the cable package and the monthly cost of the streaming services, so the savings is $60 - $26 = $34 a month.

{The final answer is $34 a month}</s>","Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20

                 [/INST] Step 1: Convert the given time units to a common unit, which is hours.
Carol spends 4 hours writing the song.
Half of this time is spent recording, so she spends 4 hours * 0.5 = 2 hours recording.
She spends 90 minutes editing, which is equivalent to 90 minutes * (1 hour / 60 minutes) = 1.5 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the total work time spent by Carol.
Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total work time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours
Total work time = 7.5 hours

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of time spent editing.
Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100%
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100%

Step 4: Perform the calculation.
Percentage of time spent editing = (1/5) * 100% = 20%

{The final answer is: 20%}</s>","First find how long Carol spent writing the song in minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<4*60=240>>240 minutes

Then add up all her work time to find the total work time: 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = <<240+120+90=450>>450 ​minutes
Then divide her editing time by her total work time and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 90 minutes / 450 minutes * 100% = 20%

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the variables and their meanings in the problem.
! = Wendy
: = a number
? = a number
! books = books that Wendy already has
shelving system = the book storage unit
rows = number of rows in the shelving system
columns = number of columns in the shelving system

Step 2: Translate the problem into an equation.
Wendy needs to have enough books to place 20 more than twice the number of books she already has in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns.
Let X represent the number of books Wendy already has.
 number of books Wendy needs = 2X + 20

Step 3: Determine the number of books Wendy needs for each row and column in the shelving system.
Each row can hold books, and each column can hold books. So, the total number of books Wendy needs is:
total number of books = rows × columns
total number of books = 6 × 6 = 36 × number of books per row

Step 4: Solve the equation from Step 2 for the number of books Wendy already has.
2X + 20 = 36 × number of books per row
Let's assume one book can fit in one cell of the shelving system, so:
number of books per row = 6
Solving this equation, we can find the number of books Wendy already has.
2X + 20 = 36 × 6
2X + 20 = 216
2X = 214
X = 107
However, since Wendy cannot have a fraction of a book, we need to round up the number of books she already has to the nearest whole number. So, Wendy needs to have 108 books to complete her task.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of books Wendy needs to carry.
total number of books = rows × columns × (number of books per row to complete the task + number of books Wendy already has)
total number of books = 6 × 6 × (number of books per row to complete the task + 108)
total number of books = 6 × 6 × (6 + 108) = 6 × 6 × 114 = 702 × 6 = 4212

{The final answer is: Wendy needs to carry 4212 books to complete her task.}</s>","The capacity of the shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns is 6*6=<<6*6=36>>36 books.

Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates, so she gave away 20 (that she made) + 30 (from her father) - 24 = <<20+30-24=42>>42 cards in total.

She kept 5 cards for her family, so she now has 42 (total) - 5 (family cards) = <<42-5=37>>37 cards left.

Lastly, she received 17 cards from family and friends, so her final total of Valentine's Day cards is 37 (remaining after passing them out) + 17 (received) = <<37+17=54>>54 cards.

Mark's share = Total slices * (1/4)
Mark'share = 12 * (1/4)
Mark'share = 3

Now, we know that Jenny eats 2 slices. To find out how many slices are left, subtract the number of slices that Bill, Mark, and Jenny had from the total number of slices:

Step 1: We know that Alice is 7 years older than Beth.
Step 2: We also know that Beth is 5 years older than Erica.

To find the difference in age between Alice and Erica, we first need to determine the age of Beth. We know that Beth is older than Erica by 5 years, so we can set up the following equation:

Beth = Erica + 5

Since Erica is 30 years old, we can substitute that value into the equation:

Beth = 30 + 5
Beth = 35

Now we know that Alice is 7 years older than Beth:

Alice = Beth + 7
Alice = 35 + 7
Alice = 42

So, Alice is 7 years older than a 35-year-old Beth, making Alice 42 years old.

1. The builder works for 6 days every week. So the number of days he works in a week is 6.
2. He works for 4 weeks every month. So the number of weeks he works in a year is: 12 months * 4 weeks/month = 48 weeks.
3. Therefore, the number of days he works in a year is: 48 weeks * 6 days/week = 288 days.

Now that we know he works for 288 days in a year, we can calculate his annual earnings:

4. The builder gets $50 every day. So his daily wage is $50.
5. To find his annual earnings, we multiply his daily wage by the number of days he works in a year: $50/day * 288 days = $14,400.

{The final answer is: $14,400}</s>","The builder works for 6 days every week and works for 4 weeks every month so he works for 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = <<6*4=24>>24 days/month

                 [/INST] Let's go through each step to find the answer:

1. Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies.
2. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk.
3. If flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

First, let's find out how much flour Mark needs for a single batch:

1 cup flour = 1 (single) bag (assuming that a 2-cup bag contains 2 cups of flour)
3 cups flour = 1.5 (single) bags
Quadruple batch = 1.5 (single) bags * 4
= 6 bags

Now, let's find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs:

1 cup milk = Unknown number of bottles (let's find out)
Quadruple batch = 1 cup milk * 4
= 4 cups milk

We are given that milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:

Therefore, the number of bottles Mark needs = Total cups of milk required / Cups contained in one bottle
= 4 cups / 2 cups
= 2 bottles

Finally, to find out how many more bags of flour Mark needs to buy than bottles of milk, we need to determine the difference:

Flour = 6 bags
Milk = 2 bottles

The difference = 6 bags - 2 bottles

{The final answer is: Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.}</s>","To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 3 cups * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cups of flour.
To get 12 cups of flour, Mark needs to buy: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = <<12/2=6>>6 bags
To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 1 cup * 4 = <<1*4=4>>4 cups of milk
To get 4 cups of milk, Mark needs to buy: 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = <<4/2=2>>2 bottles of milk
Finally, subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour to find the difference: 6 - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour.

Step 2: Calculate the energy usage per day.
The air conditioner uses 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watts or 7.2 kW of energy per day.

Step 3: Calculate the energy usage reduction per day.
Mel reduces the usage of the air conditioner by 5 hours a day. This means he saves 5 * 900 watts = 4500 watts or 4.5 kW of energy per day.

Step 4: Calculate the energy savings per month.
There are 30 days in a month. Mel saves 4.5 kW * 30 days = 135 kW of energy per month.

The final answer is: Mel saves 135 kW of electric energy every month.</s>","An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.

So, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.
That is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.

To find the average number of stripes, add the number of stripes for all three zebras and divide by the total number of zebras.

Total number of stripes = 34 + 17 + 19 = 60
Total number of zebras = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, Tyson needs to make:

20 people ÷ 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Step 2: Find out how much meat and cheese Tyson needs for 5 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so Tyson needs:

5 sandwiches ÷ 1 sandwich per pound × 2 pounds per sandwich (meat + cheese) = 10 pounds of meat and cheese

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat. Each pound of meat costs $7.00, so:

10 pounds × $7.00 per pound = $70.00

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the cheese. Each pound of cheese costs $3.00, so:

10 pounds × $3.00 per pound = $30.00

Step 5: Find the total cost of the meat and cheese for 5 sandwiches.

$70.00 (meat) + $30.00 (cheese) = $100.00

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. At Allan's house, the amount of corn is twice the amount of cannolis. Let's represent the number of cannolis with the variable C. Then, the number of corns is 2C.

2. Allan initially has 40 cannolis in his house. So we have: C = 40.

3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. So the new number of cannolis is: C + 60.

4. He also had 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since the initial number of corns was twice the number of cannolis, we have: 2C - 40.

5. We want to find the combined total of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house. So we need to find the value of 2C + C (the total number of corns) and compare it to the final number of cannolis, C + 60.

6. Let's first find the value of 2C: 2C = 2 * 40 = 80.

7. So the total number of corns Allan has is 80, and the total number of cannolis is C + 60.

8. Since C = 40, then the number of cannolis Allan has after buying more is C + 60 = 100.

9. To find the combined total, we add the number of corns (80) and cannolis (100): 80 + 100 = {180}.

Therefore, the final answer is: Allan has a combined total of 180 corns and cannolis in his house.</s>","Before buying any corn and cannoli, Allan had twice as much corn as cannoli, which is 40 cannoli * 2 corn/cannoli = <<40*2=80>>80 corns
The total number of corns and cannolis that Allan had before is 80 corn + 40 corn = <<80+40=120>>120 corn
When he bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, he bought 60 corn - 40 corn = <<60-40=20>>20 corns
In total, he bought 20 corns + 60 cannolis = <<20+60=80>>80 items
After the purchases, Allan has 120 items + 80 items = <<120+80=200>>200 total corns and cannolis combined.

2. Elliott did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, so the total number of steps he's taken until the jog is: 5,000 steps (from school) + 1,000 steps (short walk) = 6,000 steps
3. After his jog, Elliott had 2,000 steps left, so the number of steps he took during the jog is: 6,000 steps (total) - 2,000 steps (left) = 4,000 steps

{The final answer is: Elliott took 4,000 steps during his jog.}</s>","Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.

How ; many . minutes early ? will Toby be?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of pages Toby can read in one minute.
Since Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute and each page contains an average of 200 words, we can find the number of pages Toby can read in one minute.

Pages per minute = Words per minute ÷ Words per page
Pages per minute = 300 words per minute ÷ 200 words per page
Pages per minute = 1.5 pages per minute

Step 2: Calculate the number of pages Toby can read in total.
Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes (50 minutes after finishing the book due to the 10-minute travel time), we can calculate how many pages he can read during this time.

Total pages = Reading rate per minute × Total minutes
Total pages = 1.5 pages per minute × 50 minutes
Total pages = 75 pages

Step 3: Calculate the total number of words Toby can read.
To find out if Toby can finish the 45-page book on time, we need to calculate the total number of words he can read and check if it's enough to cover the book.

Total words = Total pages × Words per page
Total words = 75 pages × 200 words per page
Total words = 15,000 words

Step 4: Check if Toby can finish the book on time.
Since the book is 45 pages long and contains 9,000 words (200 words per page × 45 pages), we can calculate if Toby has enough time to read the entire book.

Book words = 45 pages × 200 words per page
Book words = 9,000 words

Step 5: Determine if Toby will be early or on time.
Since Toby can read 15,000 words in 50 minutes and the book contains 9,000 words, he will finish the book 6,000 words (1,200 additional words per minute × 5 minutes) before the airport deadline. This means Toby will be 6 minutes early.

We know that 40 employees were hired in May.

Step 2: Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June.
One fourth of the total number of employees hired in May saw their contracts expire. So we need to find 1/4th of 40.
1/4 * 40 = 10 employees

Step 3: Determine the total number of employees still working in June.
Subtract the number of employees whose contracts expired from the total number of employees hired in May:
40 (May hires) - 10 (June expired contracts) = 30 employees still working in June

Step 4: Calculate the total number of hours worked by all employees in May.
Each employee worked for 40 hours per week, so there were 40 * 40 = 1600 hours worked by all employees in May.

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money paid to all employees in May.
The company paid each employee $15 per hour, so they paid out a total of $15 * 1600 = $24,000 in May.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June.
Since there were 30 employees still working, there were a total of 30 * 40 = 1200 hours worked in June.

Step 7: Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in June.
Since the hourly wage was still $15, the company paid out $15 * 1200 = $18,000 in June.

Step 8: Determine the total amount of money paid to employees in May and June.
$24,000 (May) + $18,000 (June) = $42,000

She went to the seashore for a vacation, and her parents gave her $10 to buy whatever she wanted. So, her original amount of money is $10.

Step 5: Subtract the total cost of taffy, seashells, and magnets from the original amount of money to find the remaining amount.
The remaining amount of money is $10 - $5.50 = $4.50.

{The final answer is: $4.50.}</s>","Taffy is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound half off. So 1/2 off of 1 pound is $3/2 = $1.50+$3.00=$4.50

- The first package costs $400.
- The second package costs twice that amount.
- 2 times $400 = $800

Step 2: Calculate the discount on both packages.
- Both packages have a discount of 20%.
- Discount on the first package = $400 * 0.2 = $80
- Discount on the second package = $800 * 0.2 = $160

Step 3: Subtract the discounts from the original costs to find the final cost of both packages.
- Cost of the first package after discount = $400 - $80 = $320
- Cost of the second package after discount = $800 - $160 = $640

Step 4: Add the cost of both packages and the final firework to get the total amount spent by Tim.

= 60 cookies

Step 2: Next, we need to determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make to have 60 cookies.

We know that her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies, so:

Number of dozens of cookies needed = Number of cookies / Cookies per dozen

- Marcy makes homemade candles that she markets as 99% guaranteed not to explode.
- 5% of her candles have a defect that makes them both smell like wet dog and explode.

Step 2: Identify the variables
- Number of candles made by Marcy = 50000
- Percentage of candles with defect = 5%

Step 3: Calculate the number of candles with the defect
- Part of the candles with defect = Percentage of candles with defect * Total number of candles
- Part of the candles with defect = 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles

Step 4: Find out how many candles both smell like wet dog and explode
- We don't have enough information to determine the exact number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode since we don't know if the defect that makes the candles smell like wet dog is the same as the defect that makes them explode.

The final answer is: We cannot determine the exact number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode based on the given information.</s>","First find what percentage of the candles explode: 100% - 99% = 1%

                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the tallest and shortest trees. Since she gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, and her sister gathers twice as many apples from these trees, her sister gathers 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples.

From the shortest trees, Joanne gathers half the amount she gathers from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 * 0.5 = <<30*0.5=15>>15 apples, and her sister gathers 3 times as many apples as Joanne, so her sister gathers 15 * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples.

The total number of apples the sisters have gathered is given as 500. So the number of apples Joanne gathered in total is: 30 (from tallest) + 15 (from shortest) + X (from average) = 45 + X.

We know that 45 + X + 60 (from sister) + 45 (from sister) = 500

Solving this equation for X we get:

X = 500 - (45 + 60 + 45) = 500 - 150 = 350

So, {The final answer is: Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees}.</s>","Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.

In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.

                 [/INST] Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We know that there are a total of x camels and y dromedaries in the herd.
2. There are 180 heads in total. Since each camel and dromedary has one head, we can write the equation: x + y = 180. (The number of heads matches the total number in the herd.)
3. We also know that there are 304 bumps in total. Since camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each, we can write the equation: 2x + y = 304.
4. Now we have a system of linear equations: x + y = 180 and 2x + y = 304.
5. To find the number of camels (x) and dromedaries (y), we need to solve this system of equations. First, let's solve for y in both equations.
6. Subtracting x from both sides of the first equation, we have y = 180 - x.
7. Substituting this expression for y into the second equation, we have 2x + (180 - x) = 304.
8. Solving for x, we have x = 120.3 (which is not an integer solution, so it's an error). We made an incorrect assumption regarding the system of equations having a unique integer solution. Since this is not the case, let's assume that the number of camels is fixed, and we try to find the number of dromedaries that would satisfy the conditions.
9. If we assume that there are 60 camels, then there would be 120 camels in total (180 heads / 2 humps per camel). With this assumption, the total number of bumps would be 220 (2 humps per camel * 120 camels). However, the total number of bumps is given as 304, so we need to adjust the number of dromedaries accordingly.
10. Since each camel has 2 humps, and there are 120 camels in total, they account for 240 humps. Subtracting this number from the total number of bumps (304), we find that there are 64 humps (and therefore dromedaries) in the herd.
11. Since each dromedary has one hump, there are 64 dromedaries in the herd.

So, {The final answer is 64 dromedaries in the herd.}.</s>","Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.

1. Distance covered in the first week:
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for 4 days: 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km
   - He covered an additional 30% of this distance over the next two days: 800 km * 0.3 = 240 km
   - Tom didn't travel at all on the fifth day: 0 km
   - So, the total distance covered in the first week was: 800 km + 240 km = 1,040 km

2. Distance covered in the second week:
   - Tom traveled 300 km every day for 7 days: 300 km/day * 7 days = 2,100 km

3. Total distance covered during the two-week-long trip:
   - The first week: 1,040 km
   - The second week: 2,100 km
   - Therefore, the total distance covered was: 1,040 km + 2,100 km = 3,140 km

Step 2: We are also given that Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Since the volume of Zack's locker is X/2, the volume of Peter's locker would be (X/2)/4 = X/8.

Step 3: We are told that the volume of Peter's locker is 5 times that of Zack's locker in cubic inches. We know that the volume of Zack's locker is X/2, so the volume of Peter's locker would be 5*(X/2) = 5X/2.

Step 4: We need to find the volume of Timothy's locker in cubic inches. Since the volume of Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker and the volume of Peter's locker is 5 times that of Zack's locker, we can write the relationship between the volumes as: X = 2*(5X/2)

Step 5: Solving the equation from step 4, we get X = 10X/2, which simplifies to X = 5X. Solving for X, we find that X = 0. The volume cannot be zero, so there is a mistake in the problem statement. Please check the given information and try again.

How many , feet must ; Oliver climb to . reach the , elevation ! of Stanley's comb?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the elevation of Stanley's comb after it fell.
Since the comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet and landed on a ledge below, we can find the elevation difference between them.
The comb fell 4,000 feet, so its current elevation is 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet. {The comb is now at an elevation of 6,000 feet}.

Step 2: Find the vertical distance between Stanley and Oliver's positions.
We'll calculate this by subtracting the lower elevation (Oliver's) from the higher elevation (Stanley's).
10,000 feet (Stanley) - 3,000 feet (Oliver) = 7,000 feet.

Step 3: Determine the height Oliver must climb to reach Stanley's comb.
Since the comb is now at an elevation of 6,000 feet, Oliver must climb the vertical distance between his current position and the comb's location.
7,000 feet (total vertical distance) = 1,000 feet (first climb from Stanley to Oliver) + 6,000 feet (second climb from Oliver to Stanley's comb)
Oliver must climb a total of 1,000 + 6,000 = 7,000 feet. {Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach Stanley's comb.}

So, {The final answer is: Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach Stanley's comb}.</s>","The elevation of Stanley's comb was 10,000 - 4,000 = <<10000-4000=6000>>6,000 feet.

2. He received twice as much money from the second bank.

First, let's find out how much money he got from the second bank:
- He got twice as much as he got from the first bank.
- So, he got $4000 * 2 = $8000 from the second bank.

Finally, let's find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now:
- He had $5000 initially.
- He received $4000 from the first bank and $8000 from the second bank.
- So, his capital now is $5000 + $4000 + $8000 = $17,000.

{The final answer is: $17,000.}</s>","If the second bank gave him twice as much money as the first bank, he received 2*$4000 = $<<2*4000=8000>>8000 from the second bank.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem
We start with 50 cats on a rock. Four boats arrive, each carrying away 5 cats. Then, 3/5 of the remaining cats go after a mouse.

Step 2: Calculate how many cats were taken away by the boats
The boats took away 5 cats each. So, the number of cats taken away is: 50 (initial number of cats) - (4 boats * 5 cats per boat) = 50 - 20 = 30

Step 3: Calculate how many cats went after the mouse
1/2 of the remaining cats went after the mouse. So, we need to find the number of cats remaining after the boats took away the initial 50 cats: 50 - 30 = 20. The number of cats that went after the mouse is 3/5 * 20 = 12 (since 3/5 * 20 = 12/5, we can convert this to 12 cats).

Step 4: Calculate the number of cats left on the rock
First, we need to find the total number of cats left after the boats took away 30 cats and 12 cats went after the mouse. So, the total number of cats left is: 50 (initial number of cats) - 30 (cats taken away) - 12 (cats that went after the mouse) = 50 - 42 = 8

The final answer is: {There were 8 cats left on the rock.}</s>","When four boats carried away 5 cats each, the total number of cats that left the rock is 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cats.
The number of cats remaining on the rock became 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30.
Later 3/5 of the remaining cats left the rock and ran after a mouse, a total of 3/5*30 = <<3/5*30=18>>18 cats.
The number of cats that remained on the rock is 30-18 = <<30-18=12>>12 cats

2. Cost for the next 2 months at $12/month: 2 * $12 = $24
3. Cost for the following 14 months at $12/month: 14 * $12 = $168

Now, let's add up the costs for all three periods: $48 + $24 + $168 = $232

{The final answer is: $232}</s>","There are 12 months in a year, so there are 2 years * 12 months per year = 24 months in 2 years.
He has 6 months at the special rate, followed by 8 months of the normal rate, so out of 24 months he pays the increased rate for 24 months - 6 months - 8 months = <<24-6-8=10>>10 months.
He pays the special rate of $8 a month for 6 months, or 6 months * $8 per month = $<<6*8=48>>48.
He pays the normal rate of $12 a month for 8 months, or 8 months * $12 per month = $<<8*12=96>>96.
He pays the new raised rate of $14 a month for 10 months, or 10 months * $14 per month = $<<10*14=140>>140.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the given information.
- Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest.
- He couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans.
- The tattered jeans cost $28.
- The jogger jeans were $6 less than the tattered jeans.
- Cole saved a total of $6.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the jogger jeans.
- The tattered jeans cost $28.
- The jogger jeans were $6 less than the tattered jeans.
=> Jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22

Step 3: Determine the amount Cole saved from each type of jeans.
- Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans.
- He saved the rest from the tattered jeans.
- The total savings was $6.

Step 4: Find out how much Cole saved from each type of jeans.
- Let's assume the amount he saved from the jogger jeans is x.
- 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans is x/3, so x = 3x/3 => x = 3*(1/3)x = $2.
- This means he saved $2 from the jogger jeans.
- Savings from tattered jeans = $6 - $2 = $4

Step 5: Determine the difference in cost between the jogger and tattered jeans.
- Cole saved $2 from jogger jeans and $4 from tattered jeans.
- However, we want to find the difference in cost between the original prices.
- To calculate that difference, we need to subtract the cost of the tattered jeans from the original cost of jogger jeans.

Step 6: Find the difference between the original costs of jogger and tattered jeans.
- The cost of tattered jeans was $28.
- Cole saved $2 on jogger jeans.
=> Original cost of jogger jeans = $28 + $2 = $30.

Step 7: Answer.
{The final answer is: The original cost of jogger jeans was $30 more than the cost of the tattered jeans.}</s>","Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.
The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.
Cole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28
Hence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.
Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.

- Minibus: 30 employees
- Minivan: 15 employees

Step 2: Determine how many minibuses and minivans were rented.
- 4 buses were rented, and we know that 2 minibuses and 2 minivans make up one bus. Therefore, 4 buses are equivalent to 8 minibuses and 4 minivans.

Step 3: Calculate the number of employees each bus can accommodate.
- Each minibus can hold 30 employees, and each minivan can hold 15 employees. An entire bus (8 minibuses and 4 minivans) can hold:
  - 8 minibuses * 30 employees = 240 employees
  - 4 minivans * 15 employees = 60 employees
  For a total capacity of: 240 employees + 60 employees = 300 employees

Step 4: Determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip.
- We know that 300 employees can join the day trip using all the rented buses.

The final answer is: 300 employees.</s>","60 x 4 = <<60*4=240>>240 employees can ride on the bus.
30 x 6 = <<30*6=180>>180 employees can ride on the minibusses.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Lillian has a total of 3 feeders that she built herself and 3 feeders that she bought from the store. So, she has a total of 6 bird feeders in her garden.

Step 2: Each feeder that Lillian built herself attracts 10 more birds than a store-bodied feeder. Since each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, the homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = ³0 birds.

Step 3: Therefore, each homemade feeder attracts ³0 more birds than a store-bought feeder.

Step 4: So, in total, Lillian can expect (3 homemade + 3 store-bought) * (number of birds attracted per feeder) birds in her garden each day.

Step 5: Substituting in the value of the number of birds attracted per feeder (³0 and ²0, respectively), we have:

Number of birds in Lillian's garden each day = (3 × ³0) + (3 × ²0)

Step 6: Performing the multiplication within the parentheses and adding the results:

Number of birds in Lillian's garden each day = (3 × ³0) + (3 × ²0)

Then Lillian notices that her 3 self-made bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 extra birds.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the price of soup.
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so we find the price of the soup by calculating 25% of $4 and adding that amount to $4.

25% of $4 = 0.25 * $4 = $1

The price of the soup is $5 ($4 for the bagel + $1 for the soup).

Step 2: Calculate the price of the cake.
The cake is only half the price of the bagel.

Half the price of the bagel = $4 / 2 = $2

The price of the cake is $2.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the meal.
The cost of the meal is the sum of the cost of the bagel, the cost of the soup, and the cost of the cake.

Total cost = $4 (for the bagel) + $5 (for the soup) + $2 (for the cake)

Step 4: Find the total amount Aleksandra paid for her dinner.

Total cost = $4 (for the bagel) + $5 (for the soup) + $2 (for the cake)
Total cost = $4 + $5 + $2
Total cost = $11

{The final answer is $11.}</s>","The soup cost 4 * 25/100 = $<<4*25/100=1>>1 more than the bagel.
So the soup cost is 4 + 1 = $<<4+1=5>>5.
The cake is half the price of the bagel, so it is 4 * 0.5 = $<<4*0.5=2>>2.
Aleksandra needed to pay 4 + 5 + 2 = $<<4+5+2=11>>11 for dinner.

                 [/INST] To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to set up an equation. Let x be the number of cards Kenny has. We know that he sells 2/3 of his cards for $1.5 each, and he keeps 1/3 of his cards. The total amount of money he makes from selling his cards is $100 (enough to buy the ticket), so:

1.5 * (2/3) * x = $100

First, let's find x in terms of the total number of cards:

x = (3/2) * 100 / 1.5
x = (3/2) * 66.666667 (rounding the right side to check accuracy)
x = 60 * 1.5
x = 90

However, we made a mistake by rounding the right side. To find the correct amount of cards, let's calculate the correct value of x:

x = (3/2) * 100
x = 150

But Kenny gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash. Therefore, the real number of cards Kenny started with is:

x = 150 / $1.5/card
x = 100 cards

So, The final answer is 100 cards.</s>","He made $150 selling the cards because 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150

                 [/INST] Step 1: The caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. So, he prepared enough hot dogs for 36 guests * 2 = 72 hot dogs.

Step 2: Forty guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, the caterer needed to provide 40 guests with an additional hotdog each.

Step 3: This means the caterer needed to provide for 40 guests * 1 (extra hotdog per person) = 40 more hotdogs.

Step 4: Adding the initial required number of hotdogs (72) to the number of extra hotdogs needed (40), we get a total of 112 hotdogs required.

Step 5: Since the caterer did not have enough hotdogs to serve everyone a second hotdog, let's determine how many guests went without a second hotdog.

Step 6: Subtract the number of hotdogs the caterer had (112) from the number of hotdogs needed for everyone to have a second hotdog (40 guests * 2 hotdogs).

Difference = 40 * 2 - 112
= 80 - 112
< 0

Since the result is negative, it implies that the number of guests who didn't get a second hotdog is an undefined concept as the caterer didn't have enough hotdogs to serve everyone a second hotdog in the given circumstances.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The caterer could not fulfill the demand of all guests having a second hotdog.}</s>","The food caterer prepared an additional 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 hot dogs.
Altogether, he prepared 36 + 18 = <<36+18=54>>54 hotdogs.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine what Dora has spent money on.
- She has spent $6 on a skipping rope.
- She has spent $11 on a board game.
- She has spent $2 on a playground ball.

Step 2: Calculate how much Dora has spent in total.
Total amount spent = $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball)
Total amount spent = $19

Step 3: Determine how much money Dora has in total.
- She has saved $2 from her allowance, so she has $2.
- Her mother gave her $16, so she has an additional $16.

Step 4: Calculate how much money Dora currently has.
Total amount of money = $2 (from allowance) + $16 (from mother)
Total amount of money = $18

Step 5: Calculate how much more money Dora needs to buy all the items she wants.
- She wants to buy a skipping rope ($6), a board game ($11), and a playground ball ($2).
- She has already spent $19 on these items, but she only has $18 in total.
- Therefore, she needs an additional $1 (total cost - total amount of money) to be able to buy all the items she wants.

{The final answer is: Dora needs an additional $1 to buy all the items she wants}.</s>","The total cost of the skipping rope, the game, and the ball is $6 + $11 + $2 = $<<6+11+2=19>>19.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Josey would need in total to fill 1/4 of a container. Since 1/4 of a container is not given in gallons, we need to find that out first.

2. We know that 1 container holds 15 gallons. Since Josey needs 1/4 of a container, we need to find 1/4 of 15 gallons. This can be calculated as: (1/4) * 15 = 3.75 * 15 = 56.25 gallons. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a gallon, let's assume that Josey needs to round up to the nearest full gallon, meaning she needs 57 gallons in total.

3. Now, we know that the gas was divided equally into 5 containers. Therefore, each container must hold: 57 gallons (total needed) / 5 (number of containers) = 11.4 gallons ( approximation).

4. To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needs, we need to convert 11.4 gallons to pints. There are 4 quarts in a gallon, and there are 2 pints in a quart, so there are 2 * 4 = 8 pints in a gallon. Therefore, Josey needs 11.4 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 91.12 pints (approximation) of gasoline.

Since we made approximations throughout this problem (rounding up to full gallons and assuming 5 exact containers), our final answer is an approximation as well.

{The final answer is approximately 91.12 pints of gasoline}.</s>","15 gallons = 120 pints
120/5 = <<120/5=24>>24 pints per container

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many bags of chips George bought with his $5 spending. Each bag costs 40 cents, so:

Number of chip bags = Amount spent on chips / Price per chip bag
Number of chip bags = $5 / 0.40
Number of chip bags = 12.5

Since George can't buy half a bag, we'll assume he bought 12 bags and had 50 cents left.

Now, let's find out the total amount George spent on chips and calculate the amount he spent on candy. We know that a chip bag costs 40 cents, so:

Total amount spent on chips = Number of chip bags * Price per chip bag
Total amount spent on chips = 12 * 0.40
Total amount spent on chips = $4.80

Since George spent a total of $5, the remaining amount for candy must be:

Amount spent on candy = Total amount spent - Amount spent on chips
Amount spent on candy = $5 - $4.80
Amount spent on candy = $0.20

Now, we know that a candy bar costs 75 cents; therefore, George could buy:

Number of candy bars = Amount spent on candy / Price per candy bar
Number of candy bars = $0.20 / 0.75
Number of candy bars = 0.27 <-- Note that George can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, so let's round down

Final answer: {George bought 0 candy bars}

However, if we want to calculate the approximate number of candy bars he could buy if he spent the rest of his $5, we can continue the calculation:

Approximate number of candy bars = Amount left / Price per candy bar
Approximate number of candy bars = $0.50 / 0.75
Approximate number of candy bars = 0.67 ≈ 1 (rounded down)

So, if George spent the rest of his $5, he could have bought approximately 1 candy bar.

Please note that due to rounding errors, the sum of the approximate number of chip bags and candy bars may not exactly be equal to 13. In practice, George should have bought 11 chip bags (12 with one rounded off) and 1 candy bar to use the entire $5.</s>","George got $.05 in change because 5 x .01 = <<5*.01=.05>>.05
George spent $4.95 because 5 - .05 = <<5-.05=4.95>>4.95

George spent 3.75 on candy bars because 4.95 - 1.2 = <<4.95-1.2=3.75>>3.75
George bought 5 candy bars because 3.75 / .75 = <<5=5>>5

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray kept for himself. We know he started with 25 lollipops and gave 5 away. So:

Total lollipops Ray had = 25
Lollipops Ray kept = Total lollipops - Lollipops given away
= 25 - 5
= 20 lollipops

Step 2: Now, we know that Ray shared the remaining lollipops equally among his 4 friends. To calculate how many lollipops each friend received, we simply divide the number of remaining lollipops by the number of friends:

Lollipops per friend = Total remaining lollipops / Number of friends
= (20 lollipops) / 4 friends
= 5 lollipops

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The problem states that the cake weighs 20 ounces before it was cut.

Step 2: Calculate the weight of each piece after the cake was cut into 8 pieces.
To find the weight of each piece, we divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces.
Weight of one piece = Total weight of the cake / Number of pieces
Weight of one piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of one piece = 2.5 ounces

Step 3: Calculate the weight of the two pieces Rory and her mom consumed.
Each person consumed one piece of the cake, so they each consumed 2.5 ounces of cake.

Step 4: Find the total weight of the two pieces consumed.
Total weight consumed = Weight of one piece * Number of pieces consumed
Total weight consumed = 2.5 ounces * 2
Total weight consumed = 5 ounces

Step 5: Determine the weight of the remaining cake.
Remaining weight = Total weight of the cake - Total weight consumed
Remaining weight = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Remaining weight = 15 ounces

Sitti bought 34 oranges.
Juris bought 22 oranges.

Total oranges = Oranges bought by Sitti + Oranges bought by Juris
Total oranges = 34 + 22
Total oranges = 56

Step 2: Determine how many friends each person has.
Each person has 6 friends.

Step 3: Find out how many oranges each friend would receive if the oranges were shared equally among friends and themselves.

Total oranges for all friends = Total oranges / Number of people (Sitti, Juris, and their friends)
Total oranges for all friends = 56 / (3 + 2 * 6)
Total oranges for all friends = 56 / (3 + 12)
Total oranges for all friends = 56 / 15
Total oranges for all friends ≈ 3.73 * 15
Total oranges for all friends ≈ 55.95
Since we cannot share a fraction of an orange, we need to round down the total oranges to the nearest whole number that can be evenly distributed.

Total oranges for all friends = 55

Step 4: Find how many oranges each person (including Sitti and Juris) would get.

Oranges per person = Total oranges for all friends / Number of people
Oranges per person = 55 / (3 [Sitti and Juris] + 6 [their friends])
Oranges per person = 55 / 9
Oranges per person ≈ 6.11
Oranges per person ≈ 6 [rounding down]

So, each person, including Sitti and Juris, would get approximately 6 oranges. However, this is less than the original number of oranges purchased. In this case, it seems that there would not be enough oranges to share equally with all friends and themselves.

Final answer: {There is not enough information to share the oranges equally among Sitti, Juris, and their friends.}</s>","There are a total of 34 + 22 = <<34+22=56>>56 oranges.
Sitti, Juris, and 6 other friends will divide them equally which means there are 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 of them sharing.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the amount of onions Antoine needs when he doubles the recipe quantity.
The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions. Antoine wants to double that, so:
Antoine needs 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 pounds of onions

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the onions.
The onions are currently on sale for $2.00 per pound. So, the cost of 4 pounds of onions is:
Cost of onions = 4 * $2.00 = $<<4*2=8>>8

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the beef stock.
The recipe calls for no specific mention of beef stock quantity, we don't have enough information to calculate it.

Step 4: Determine the number of servings from a single pound of onions.
The recipe serves 6 people, and we determined Antoine needs 4 pounds of onions. So, the number of servings from a single pound of onions is:
Servings per pound = 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3

Step 5: Calculate the cost per serving.
Now we know the cost of onions and the number of servings from a single pound. We can calculate the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings.
Cost per serving = $8 / 3

Now, to round the result to the nearest integer:
If Cost per serving is a decimal number, round it up to the next integer if the decimal part is equal to or greater than 0.5, and round it down to the previous integer if the decimal part is less than 0.5.

Let's see if our cost per serving is a decimal number.
Cost per serving = $<<8/3=2.6666666666667>>2.67
Since the decimal part is greater than 0.5, we round up to the next integer.

Therefore, {The final answer is $<<round(2.67,0)=3>>3 per serving.}</s>","His recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions but he wants to double that amount so he needs 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 pounds of onions

He needs 2 boxes of stock which are also on sale for $2.00 so they will cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00
The onions are $8.00 and the stock is $4.00 for a total of 8+4 = $<<8+4=12.00>>12.00
The soup serves 6 people and the total cost is $12.00 so each serving is 12/6 = $<<12/6=2.00>>2.00 a serving

- Wayne and Bernadette are movie stars going to the premiere of their latest film.
- Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
- Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater.
- Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city.
- The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel.
- It takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.

Step 2: Define the problem in terms of unknowns and knowns.
The unknowns in this problem are:
- The time it takes for Bernadette to be driven to the theater.
- The time Bernadette should leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

The knowns in this problem are:
- Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater.
- The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel.

Step 3: Solve the problem
Let X be the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, her driving time is 4X.

We want Bernadette to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so her departure time is X - 5 minutes.

Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, we can set up the equation: 4X = X + 5

Step 4: Solve the equation
To solve the equation, we can subtract X from both sides, which gives us 3X = 5. Then we can divide both sides by 3: X = 5/3

So it takes Wayne 5/3 minutes to drive to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes 4*(5/3) = 20/3 minutes.

Step 5: Find Bernadette's departure time
Since Bernadette's drive takes 20/3 minutes and she wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, her departure time should be:

X - 5 = 5/3
X = 8/3 + 5
X = 13 and 1/3 minutes

However, since time is usually given in hours and minutes, we should convert the fractional part (1/3) to minutes:

Step 6: Show the final answer
{The final answer is Bernadette should leave 13 and 1/3 hours (equal to approximately 13 hours and 20 minutes) before the premiere to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.}</s>","Bernadette takes 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 minutes to get to the theater.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Convert the area given in square feet to square yards.
1 yard = 3 feet, so 1 square yard = 3 feet * 3 feet = 9 square feet.

360 square feet = 360 square feet / 9 square feet/square yard = 40 square yards

Step 2: Find the dimensions of the room using the given area (3 yards) and the known relationship between area and length and width.

Given: Area (A) = 360 square feet = 40 square yards, and Length (L) = 3 yards

Since the area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = L * W, where L is the length and W is the width.

Substituting the given values, we get W = A / L = 40 square yards / 3 yards = 13.33 yards (approximately, since 3 * 13.33 = 40.001, but we're assumed to round to the nearest yard).

So, the dimensions of the room are approximately 3 yards x 13.3 yards (or 3 yards x 14 yards if you round up).

Step 3: Calculate the perimeter using the formula P = 2 * (L + W)

Since we know the length (L) and the approximate width (W), we can find the perimeter as follows:

P = 2 * (L + W) ≈ 2 * (3 yards + 14 yards) ≈ 2 * 17 yards = 34 yards

The final answer is: The perimeter of Billie's bedroom is approximately 34 yards.</s>","The length of the room is 3 yards * (3 feet / 1 yard) = <<3*(3/1)=9>>9 feet.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of beads Elizabeth has as X and the number of beads Margareth has as Y.

First, let's calculate the number of beads each sister purchased.

Elizabeth bought:
- red beads: 1 pack * 20 pieces = 20 pieces
- clear beads: 2 packs * 20 pieces = 40 pieces
- Total beads for Elizabeth: 20 + 40 = 60 pieces

Margareth bought:
- blue beads: 3 packs * 20 pieces = 60 pieces
- red beads: 4 packs * 20 pieces = 80 pieces
- Total beads for Margareth: 60 + 80 = 140 pieces

Now, let's find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:

Difference = Y (Margareth's beads) - X (Elizabeth's beads)

Substituting the values we calculated:
Difference = 140 - 60

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

The final answer is: {Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth}.</s>","Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs.
So Elizabeth bought 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 pieces of beads.
Margareth bought 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 packs.
So Margareth bought 7 x 20 = <<7*20=140>>140 pieces of beads.
Therefore, Margareth bought 140 - 60 = <<140-60=80>>80 more beads than Elizabeth.

                 [/INST] First, let's determine the temperature increase during baking:

Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
Baking time = 3 hours

Total temperature increase during baking = Temperature increase per hour * Baking time
= 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours
= 15 degrees

Next, let's determine the temperature decrease during the open window time:

Temperature decrease per 10 minutes = 2 degrees
Window open time = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours

Total temperature decrease during the open window = Temperature decrease per 10 minutes * Window open time (in hours)
= 2 degrees/10 minutes * 0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour
= 6 degrees

Now, let's calculate the house's final temperature:

Initial house temperature = 40 degrees
Total temperature increase during baking = 15 degrees
Total temperature decrease during the open window = 6 degrees

House's final temperature = Initial house temperature + Total temperature increase during baking - Total temperature decrease during the open window
= 40 degrees + 15 degrees - 6 degrees
= 51 degrees

{The final answer is: The house's final temperature is 51 degrees.}</s>","First find the total temperature increase from the oven: 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees
Then add that amount to the starting temperature: 15 degrees + 40 degrees = <<15+40=55>>55 degrees
Then divide the time the window is open by 10 minutes to find how many 2-degree temperature decreases there are: 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3
Then multiply the number of decreases by the amount of each decrease: 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees
Then subtract that amount from the house's temperature after baking to find the final temperature: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = <<55-6=49>>49 degrees

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jon takes 40 minutes for swimming, 1 hour (60 minutes) for biking, and 50 minutes for running. So, the total time for Jon to complete the triathlon is 40 + 60 + 50 = <<40+60+50=130>>130 minutes.

2. James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. If Jon takes 40 minutes for swimming, then James takes 40 minutes × (1 - 0.1) = 40 minutes × 0.9 = <<40*0.9=36>>36 minutes for swimming.

3. The difference in their swimming times is 40 minutes (Jon) – 36 minutes (James) = 4 minutes.

4. The difference in the bike times is given as 5 minutes. Since James took longer on the bike, his bike time is Jon's bike time + the difference, i.e., 60 minutes (Jon's bike time) + 5 minutes = 65 minutes.

5. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes. Jon took 130 minutes for the entire triathlon, and James took 36 minutes for the swim and 65 minutes for the bike. Therefore, the difference in their run times is 130 minutes (Jon's total time) – 36 minutes (James' swim time) – 65 minutes (James' bike time) = 29 minutes.

The final answer is: James took 29 minutes for the run.</s>","Jon did the bike ride in 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes
So his total time was 40+80+50=<<40+80+50=170>>170 minutes
James finished the swim 40*.1=<<40*.1=4>>4 minutes faster
So he finished the swim in 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 minutes
He finished the bike ride in 80+5=<<80+5=85>>85 minutes
James' total time was 170+10=<<170+10=180>>180
So it took him 180-85-36=<<180-85-36=59>>59 minutes to do the run

1. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B.
2. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C.
3. Movie C is 1.25 hours long.

To find the length of Movie A in minutes, we first need to find the length of Movie B and Movie C in minutes.

1. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, and Movie C is 1.25 hours long. To find the length of Movie C in minutes, we know that 1 hour = 60 minutes. So, Movie C is 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes long.
2. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, which means Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.
3. Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, the length of Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is {Movie A is 20 minutes long}.</s>","Movie C = 1.25 hours = 75 minutes

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 MPH.

We know that:
1 mile = 5280 feet
1 hour = 3600 seconds

Let x be the number of miles, so:
x miles = (30 minutes) x (32 miles per hour) / (60 minutes per hour)
x miles = 32 x (30/60) x 5280 feet / 5280 feet per mile

Calculating this, we get:
x miles = 32 x 0.5 x 1 = 16 miles

Step 2: Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse needs for each mile.

The problem states that the horse needs 1/2 a bail of hay for each mile. So, the horse needs:

1/2 bail of hay x 16 miles = 8 bails of hay

Step 3: Now we need to find out how much 8 bails of hay cost.

The problem states that a bail of hay costs $3. So, the cost of 8 bails of hay is:

8 bails of hay x $3 per bail = $24

Step 4: Lastly, we need to find out how much change Michael will have after buying this hay with his six $5 bills.

First, we find out how much money Michael has in total:
$5 x 6 = $30

Then, we subtract the cost of the hay from his total amount of money:
$30 - $24 = $6

{The final answer is: Michael has $6 in change after buying the hay for his horse.}</s>","The horse runs 16 miles because 32 x (30/60) = <<32*(30/60)=16>>16
The horse needs to eat 8 bails of hay because 16 x .5 = <<16*.5=8>>8
The hay will cost $24 because 8 x $3 = <<8*3=24>>24
Michael has $30 because 6 x $5 = <<6*5=30>>30

Rozanne uses 4 dozens of eggs which is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. She also uses 2 loose eggs. So the total number of eggs used is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Step 2: Determine the number of eggs required for each tray.
Each tray holds enough eggnog for 5 glasses, and each glass requires 5 eggs. Therefore, each tray requires 5 * 5 = 25 eggs.

Step 3: Determine the number of trays that can be put out.
Rozanne has enough eggs for 50 eggs / 25 eggs/tray = 2 trays. However, since she can only put out full trays, she can put out {The final answer is: 2 trays}.</s>","As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.
She therefore has a total of 48 eggs in cases + 2 loose eggs = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs.
So she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.
This means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.

                 [/INST]Step 1: Determine the price the salesman paid for the sneakers.
The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. Each sneaker in the case is therefore:

Price per sneaker = Total price paid / Number of sneakers
Price per sneaker = $576 / 48
Price per sneaker = $12.25

Step 2: Find out how many sneakers the salesman sold at the flash sale.
He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:

Money from flash sale = Number of sneakers sold * Selling price
Money from flash sale = 17 * $20
Money from flash sale = $340

Step 3: Calculate how many sneakers the salesman sold to the department store.
The number of sneakers sold to the department store is the total number of sneakers in the case minus the number sold at the flash sale:

Sneakers sold to department store = Total number of sneakers - Sneakers sold at flash sale
Sneakers sold to department store = 48 - 17
Sneakers sold to department store = 31

Step 4: Determine how much money the salesman earned from selling sneakers to the department store.
Money from department store sales = Number of sneakers sold * Price per sneaker
Money from department store sales = 31 * $25
Money from department store sales = $775

Step 5: Find out the salesman's total earnings from both sales.
Total earnings = Money from flash sale + Money from department store sales
Total earnings = $340 + $775
Total earnings = $1,115

Step 6: Calculate the salesman's profit by subtracting his cost (what he paid for the sneakers) from his total earnings.
Profit = Total earnings - Cost
Profit = $1,115 - $576
Profit = $539

1. First, let's find out the cost of a movie ticket and popcorn and soda together with the super ticket. We know that a movie ticket costs $20 with the super ticket, and we get one popcorn and one soda for an additional $1. So, the total cost with the super ticket is $21.
2. Now, let's compare the cost of buying a movie ticket alone and buying popcorn and a soda separately. We know that a movie ticket costs $12, and a popcorn costs the regular price and a soda costs $3. We're given that we saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
3. Let x be the regular price of popcorn.
4. Therefore, the cost of just buying a movie ticket is $12, and the cost of buying a popcorn and a soda separately is $12 + x + $3.
5. Since we saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, we can write the equation: $21 = $12 + x + $3
6. Simplifying the equation, we get: x = $9

So, the final answer is: {The regular price of popcorn is $9}.</s>","The super ticket costs $20 and for $1 extra I can get a popcorn and a soda, there I'd pay in total $20+$1 = $<<20+1=21>>21

                 [/INST] To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to first find the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then divide the total distance by the total time.

Step 1: Find the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance1 = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles

Step 2: Find the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour.
Distance2 = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles

Step 3: Find the total distance traveled during the trip.
Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Step 4: Find the total time taken for the trip.
Time1 = 2 hours
Time2 = 1 hour
Total Time = Time1 + Time2 = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Step 5: Find the average speed during the entire trip.
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours

Step 6: Simplify the fraction to get the final answer.
Average Speed = 50 mph
{The final answer is: The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph}</s>","The car drives 60*2=<<60*2=120>>120 miles for 2 hours.
The car drives 30*1=<<30*1=30>>30 miles for 1 hour.
It drives a total of 120+30=<<120+30=150>>150 miles.
Let S be the average speed, M be the number of miles, and H the number of hours spent driving.
Then we have, S=M/H, so, S=150 miles/3 hours = <<150/3=50>>50 mph

= 8 apples

Step 2: They both eat this amount every day for a period of 30 days. To find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days, multiply the daily apple consumption by the number of days.

total apples eaten = apples eaten in 1 day * number of days

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
Since each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall, its volume is: 2 ft (width) x 8 ft (length) x 2 ft (height) = 32 cubic feet.

Step 2: Calculate the total volume of all raised beds.
There are 10 raised beds, so the total volume is: 10 beds x 32 cubic feet (per bed) = 320 cubic feet.

Step 3: Calculate the volume of soil required for each raised bed.
Each raised bed requires 32 cubic feet of soil, so the total volume of soil needed is: 10 beds x 32 cubic feet (per bed) = 320 cubic feet.

Step 4: Calculate the number of bags of soil required.
Since each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, the total number of bags required is: 320 cubic feet (total volume) / 2 cubic feet (per bag) = 160 bags.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.
Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is: 160 bags x $12 (per bag) = $1,920.

                 [/INST] To find the number of cards of all mentioned colors, we need to first find the number of red and green cards.

1. Red cards: There are 15 red cards in the deck.

2. Green cards: Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, there are 15 * 1.6 = 24 red cards + 60% * 15 = 24 * 1.6 = 38.4 ≈ 39 red cards (since we can't have a fraction of a card).

3. Yellow cards: We're told that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards. So there are 15 + 39 = 54 yellow cards.

Therefore, the total number of cards in the deck is 15 red + 39 green + 54 yellow = 108 cards.

{The final answer is 108 cards.}</s>","There are 60/100 * 15 = <<60/100*15=9>>9 more green cards than red cards.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the given information.
- Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the forest during her playtime.
- After about twenty minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw.
- Fairies came from the east and joined the ones already there.
- Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.

Step 2: Analyze the information given.
1. Katelyn saw 50 fairies initially.
2. One of her friends saw half of that, so there were 50 * 0.5 = <<50*0.5=25>>25 fairies after some time.
3. Fairies came from the east and joined the ones already there, but no exact number was given.
4. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.

Step 3: Find the remaining fairies.
Let's first find the total number of fairies before the fairies from the east joined. Since 25 fairies were present after some time, and 30 fairies flew away, the total number of fairies before they flew away was 25 + 30 = <<25+30=55>>55. Since Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies, the number of fairies from the east was 55 - 50 = <<55-50=5>>5. Therefore, there were originally 50 + 5 = <<50+5=55>>55 fairies.

Step 4: Verify and conclude.
We followed each step carefully and arrived at the answer:
There were initially 55 fairies in the playground.
{The final answer is 55 fairies.}</s>","Katelyn's friend saw 1/2*50 = <<1/2*50=25>>25, half as many fairies as Katelyn initially saw
The total number of fairies flying above the forest now is 50 + 25 = <<50+25=75>>75
If thirty fairies then flew away, there were 75 - 30 = <<75-30=45>>45 fairies that remained.

Jennifer's dog: 8 puppies, 3 with spots
Number of puppies with spots for Jennifer = 3

Brandon's dog: 12 puppies, 4 with spots
Number of puppies with spots for Brandon = 4

Step 2: Calculate the total number of puppies with spots across both dogs.
Total number of puppies with spots = Number for Jennifer + Number for Brandon
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots out of all puppies.
Total number of puppies = 8 for Jennifer + 12 for Brandon = 20
Percentage of puppies with spots = (Number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100

Total weight = 3150 pounds + 48 pounds + 1300 pounds + 2 pounds
Total weight = 4492 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the number of trips needed to transport all the feed.
Trips needed = Total weight / Weight that the farmer's truck can carry in one trip
Trips needed = 4492 pounds / 2250 pounds
Trips needed = 2 trips approximately (since the farmer's truck can't carry a fraction of a load)

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of basketball cards Miss Maria has in total.
We know that Miss Maria has 6 decks, and each deck contains 25 basketball cards. So, she has:
6 decks ×25 basketball cards/deck = 150 basketball cards

Step 2: Calculate the number of basketball cards remaining after Miss Maria keeps 50 cards.
The number of basketball cards she keeps is 50. So, there are:
Total basketball cards - Cards Miss Maria keeps = Remaining basketball cards
150 basketball cards - 50 basketball cards = 100 basketball cards

Step 3: Calculate the number of baseball cards in each box.
We know that there are 5 boxes, and each box contains 40 baseball cards. So, there are:
5 boxes×40 baseball cards/box = 200 baseball cards

Step 4: Calculate the total number of baseball cards.
Since she gives each student 10 baseball cards, the number of baseball cards she keeps is equal to the number of students multiplied by 10. So, there are:
10 basketball cards/student × Number of students = Total baseball cards kept
10 baseball cards/student × (Total basketball cards - 50 basketball cards)/10 basketball cards/student = Total baseball cards kept
(Total basketball cards - 50)/1 = Total baseball cards kept
155/1 = 155 students (However, this is obviously not possible since the number of students must be a whole number. So, there's an error in the problem, and we cannot find a definitive answer based on the given information.)

Therefore, due to an inconsistency in the problem, we cannot determine the final number of students based on the given information. {The final answer is undefined.}</s>","There are 6 x 25 = <<6*25=150>>150 basketball cards.
And, there are 5 x 40 = <<5*40=200>>200 baseball cards.

She gave a total of 350 - 50 = <<350-50=300>>300 cards to her students.
Therefore, Miss Maria has 300/10 = <<300/10=30>>30 students.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of apples Becky bought.
 cost of apples for Becky = number of apples * price per apple
 cost of apples for Becky = 20 * $0.45
 cost of apples for Becky = $9

Step 2: Calculate the discount Becky received.
 discount = $1

Step 3: Calculate the actual cost Becky paid for the apples.
 cost for Becky = cost of apples - discount
 cost for Becky = $9 - $1
 cost for Becky = $8

Step 4: Calculate the number of apples Kelly bought.
 number of apples for Kelly = given
 number of apples for Kelly = 20

Step 5: Calculate the price per apple for Kelly.
 price per apple for Kelly = given
 price per apple for Kelly = $0.50

Step 6: Calculate the discount Kelly received.
 discount for Kelly = 10% of number of apples * price per apple
 discount for Kelly = 0.1 * 20 * $0.50
 discount for Kelly = $5

Step 7: Calculate the cost of apples Kelly paid after discount.
 cost of apples for Kelly after discount = number of apples * (price per apple - discount)
 cost of apples for Kelly after discount = 20 * ($0.50 - $0.05)
 cost of apples for Kelly after discount = $9

Step 8: Calculate the cost of apples Kelly paid before discount.
 cost of apples for Kelly before discount = cost of apples for Kelly after discount + discount
 cost of apples for Kelly before discount = $9 + $5
 cost of apples for Kelly before discount = $14

Step 9: Calculate the difference in cost between Becky and Kelly.
 difference = cost for Becky - cost for Kelly
 difference = $8 - $14
 difference = -$6

Note: A negative difference means that Kelly paid less than Becky. However, in this case, the question asks for the difference in the amount that they paid, not the actual amount paid by each. Since the question asks for ""how much more did Kelly pay than Becky,"" it means that we should determine the absolute value of the difference (i.e., Kelly paid more than Becky by |$6| = $6).

Therefore, the final answer is: {Kelly paid $6 more than Becky}.</s>","Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9
With the discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $<<9-1=8>>8.
Before the discount Kelly would have paid 20 apples x $0.50/apple = $<<20*0.5=10>>10
With a 10 percent discount Kelly paid ($10 x 10)/100 = $<<(10*10)/100=1>>1 less
In total Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $<<10-1=9>>9.
Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $<<9-8=1>>1 more than Becky.

1. We have 80 rooms in the hotel.
2. Each room contains two sets of bed sheets. Since there are two sheets in a set, there are 2 * 2 = 4 sheets per room.
3. Each room has one comforter. So there are 80 comforters.
4. For each set of sheets, there are twice as many pillowcases as sheets. So, for each room, there are 2 * 4 = 8 pillowcases.
5. Therefore, there are 80 rooms * 8 pillowcases/room = 640 pillowcases in total.
6. Lastly, for each set of sheets, there are twice as many towels as pillowcases. So, for each room, there are 2 * 8 = 16 towels.
7. Thus, there are 80 rooms * 16 towels/room = 1280 towels in total.

The total number of pieces of laundry in the hotel is: 
4 sheets/room * 80 rooms + 1 comforter/room * 80 rooms + 8 pillowcases/room * 80 rooms + 16 towels/room * 80 rooms = 80* (4 + 1 + 8 + 16) = 80 * 28 = 2176.

2. On Wednesday, he gets 15 new pairs of shoes, which is equal to 15 * 2 = 30 new shoes. So, he now has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

3. On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of new shoes, which is equal to 30 * 2 = 60 new shoes. So, he now has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

4. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, he now has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

5. On Sunday, there is no new information given about shoes, so Frank will have the same number of shoes that he had at the end of the previous day.

Therefore, the final answer is: Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes on Sunday.</s>","If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300

2. Find the total length of both remoras: 2 x 6 inches = 12 inches.

3. Calculate the percentage of the shark's length that is taken up by the remoras: (Total length of remoras / Total length of shark) x 100%

4. Perform the calculation: (12 inches / 120 inches) x 100% = 10%

Three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, so:
Number of students with desktop computers = (Number of students) x (3/4)

Step 2: Subtract the number of students without desktop computers.
Number of students without desktop computers = 20

Step 3: Find the total number of students at this grade level.
Total number of students = (Number of students with desktop computers) + (Number of students without desktop computers)

The equation is:

Total number of students = (Number of students) x (3/4) + 20

To find the value of this equation, we need to know the number of students. Let's call this value 's'. Substituting this in the equation, we get:

s = s x (3/4) + 20

Multiplying both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

Given that it takes 240 minutes to break in a new pair of shoes.

Step 2: Determine how many weeks Jason has to prepare for the track team.
Given that Jason has three weeks to prepare. Three weeks is equal to 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Step 3: Determine how many days per week Jason can walk to break in his shoes.
Given that Jason can walk 4 days a week to break in his new shoes.

Step 4: Calculate how long Jason needs to walk each day to break in his shoes.
Since we know that it takes 240 minutes to break in a new pair of shoes, and Jason can walk 4 days a week, we need to find out how long he has to walk each day to break in his shoes within that time frame.
First, we determine the total number of minutes Jason can walk in three weeks:
Total minutes = Number of days in three weeks * Minutes per day
Total minutes = 21 days * Minutes per day

We don't know the value of ""Minutes per day,"" so let's find it.

Step 5: Solve for ""Minutes per day.""
We know that total minutes = 240 minutes (from step 1), so we can use this information to find the number of minutes Jason needs to walk each day:
Minutes per day = Total minutes / Number of days
Minutes per day = 240 minutes / 21 days
Minutes per day ≈ 11.43 minutes/day

However, we cannot have a fraction of a minute, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number that is close to this value.
Given that 12 minutes is greater than 11.43 minutes, and it's a common time measurement, let's assume that Jason needs to walk for 12 minutes each day to break in his shoes.

Therefore, {The final answer is Jason needs to walk for 12 minutes each day to break in his new shoes.}</s>","First find how many days Jason has to prepare for the tryouts: 3 weeks * 4 days/week = <<3*4=12>>12 days
Then divide the time it takes to break the shoes in by the time Jason can spend each day to find how long he needs to walk each day: 240 minutes / 12 days = <<240/12=20>>20 minutes/day

1. We know that there are 9 kids who are allergic to dairy, 6 kids who are allergic to peanuts, and 3 kids who are allergic to both.
2. First, let's find the number of kids who are allergic to only one type of allergen. Since there are 9 kids allergic to dairy and 6 kids allergic to peanuts, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 kids who have only one allergy.
3. Next, we have 3 kids who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts. Since we've already counted these kids as having both a dairy and a peanut allergy, we need to subtract them from the total number of kids with one allergy to account for the fact that they're double-counted: 15 - 3 = <<15-3=12>>12 kids with only one allergy.
4. Therefore, there are a total of 9 + 6 + 3 = <<9+6+3=18>>18 kids who have an allergy of some kind.
5. Since there are 32 kids in the class, the number of kids who don't have any allergies is 32 - 18 = <<32-18=14>>14 kids.

Weight of 2010 penny = 3/4 * Weight of 1959 penny

Given that the weight of the 1959 penny is 48 grains, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = 3/4 * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 35.2667 grains (rounded to 5 decimal places)

To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weights of both pennies:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 35.2667 grains

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is approximately 83.2667 grains.

Step 2: Find out how many more songs Luri can add to his player.
Each player can store up to 100 songs. Since Luri currently has 60 songs, he can add 100 (maximum capacity) - 60 (currently have) = <<100-60=40>>40 more songs.

Gabriel's player can also store up to 100 songs, and he currently has 20 songs. So, he can add 100 (maximum capacity) - 20 (currently have) = <<100-20=80>>80 more songs.

Step 4: Find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his player.
To find the difference, subtract the number of songs Gabriel can add from the number of songs Luri can add. So, 80 (Gabriel) - 40 (Luri) = <<80-40=40>>40 fewer songs Gabriel can add to his player than Luri can add to his.

1. Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked. So the number of oranges Stetson ate is 2/5 * 60.

2. Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, to find out how much money he gave up in total, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up for each orange:

Total amount of money Stetson gave up = Oranges eaten by Stetson * Money given up per orange

2. The problem states that H < 3S. We are looking for a handbag cost that is less than 3 times the cost of her shoes.
3. If we multiply the cost of the shoes S = $80 by 3, we get 3S = $240. This is more than Jillian's handbag cost.
4. To find a handbag cost that is less than 3 times the shoes cost, we need to find a number less than 3. Let's try 2.
5. Multiplying the cost of the shoes S = $80 by 2, we get 2S = $160. This is still more than Jillian's handbag cost.

Uncle Ben feeds his horses twice a day.
So, each horse consumes 5 pounds x 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed all his horses in one day:
Uncle Ben has 4 horses.
Each horse consumes 10 pounds of oats per day.
So, Uncle Ben needs 4 horses x 10 pounds = 40 pounds of oats per day to feed all his horses.

Now, we need to determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to buy for one day:
One bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
So, Uncle Ben needs 40 pounds ÷ 50 pounds/bag = approximately 0.8 bags of oats per day. Since Uncle Ben can't buy a fraction of a bag, he'll need to buy 2 bags of oats per day to feed all his horses.

Finally, we need to find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for five days:

1. Find out how many Pomeranians Jana has.
2. Calculate how many of those are girls.

Step 1: Find out how many Pomeranians Jana has.
We know that Jana has 27 puppies and two-thirds of them are Pomeranians.

> Pomeranians = Total puppies * 2/3
> = 27 * 2/3
> = 27 * (2/3)
> = 18.67 (approximately, since we can't have a fraction of a puppy)
> ≈ 19

Since we can't have a fraction of a puppy, we'll round up to ensure we don't underestimate the number of Pomeranians.

Jana has approximately 19 Pomeranians.

Step 2: Calculate how many of the Pomeranians are girls.
We know that one-third of the Pomeranians are girls.

> Girl Pomeranians = Number of Pomeranians * 1/3
> = 19 * 1/3
> = 19 / 3
> = 6.33 (approximately)

1. The child wants to buy a toy car that costs $12.
2. He currently has $4 savings.
3. He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance.
4. The remaining amount of money the child needs to save is $12 (cost of the toy car) - $4 (current savings) = $8.
5. To find out how many days it takes for the child to save $8, we divide $8 by $2: $8 ÷ $2 = ₱4.

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save enough money to buy the toy car.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the price of one pack of razors after the discount.
The price of one pack is $4.00, and with the ""buy one, get one free"" offer, Heather effectively pays for only one pack. So the price of one pack after the discount is $4.00.

Step 2: Calculate the price of two packs after the discount.
Since the price of one pack after the discount is $4.00, the price of two packs after the discount is $4.00 * 2 = $8.00.

Step 3: Apply the $2.00 coupon to the price of two packs.
Heather has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost of two packs after the discount and the application of the coupon is $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

Step 4: Determine the cost of each individual razor in cents.
Each pack contains 4 razors. The price of two packs is $6.00, so the combined cost of both packs is 4 razors/pack * 2 packs * $6.00/pack = $24.00.
Therefore, the cost of one individual razor is $24.00 / (4 razors/pack * 2 packs) = $2.00 * 1/2 = $1.00, or 100 cents.

{The final answer is: Each individual razor costs 100 cents, or $1.00.}</s>","Buy one get one free means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 and she has a $2.00 coupon, so the razors will cost her $4-$2 = $2.00
Each pack has 4 razors and she buys 2 packs for a total of 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 razors
The razors cost $2.00 and she bought 8 so that means each razor costs $2.00/8 = $<<2/8=0.25>>0.25 each

                 [/INST] Let's call the number of cheerleaders ""N."" We're given that 9 out of 10 are 64 inches tall, which means 1 out of 10, or 1 cheerleader, is not 64 inches tall and is 60 inches tall. Therefore, N = 10 - 1 = 9 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and 1 is 60 inches tall.

The pyramid consists of 4 cheerleaders on the bottom level, 3 on the next level (on top of the 4), and 2 on the top level (on top of the 3). We need to find the total height of this pyramid.

First, the height of the 4 girls on the bottom level:
height of one girl = 64 inches
height of bottom level = 4 girls * height of one girl = 4 * 64 = 256 inches

Next, the height of the 3 girls on the next level. Each girl is standing on the shoulders of two girls beneath, so her height above the ground is only half her actual height:
height of one girl = 64 inches
height of a girl standing on two girls = 64 inches / 2 = 32 inches
height of the next level = 3 girls * height of one girl = 3 * 64 = 192 inches

Finally, the height of the 2 girls on the top level. Each girl is standing on the shoulders of three girls beneath, so her height above the ground is only one-third her actual height:
height of one girl = 64 inches
height of a girl standing on three girls = 64 inches / 3 = 21.33 inches (approximately)
height of top level = 2 girls * height of one girl = 2 * 64 = 128 inches

Total height of the pyramid = height of bottom level + height of next level + height of top level = 256 inches + 192 inches + 128 inches = 576 inches

{The final answer is 576 inches or approximately 48 feet.}</s>","All but one cheerleader is 64"" tall and these cheerleaders make up the bottom 3 layers of the pyramid. So, when standing on top of each other, they are 64*3 = <<64*3=192>>192"" tall

2. In four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now.
3. Let's represent Brett's current age with the variable ""b,"" and Angela's current age with the variable ""a.""
4. According to the problem, we have the following equations: b + 4 = a * 3 and b = 14

5. We can now solve for Angela's current age by substituting b = 14 into the first equation and solving for a: 14 + 4 = 3 * 14 => 18 = 42 => a = 42 / 3
6. Simplifying the equation a = 14 + 4*(1/3) results in a = 14 + 4*(0.333...) = 14 + 1.333... = 15.333...
7. Since Angela's age must be a whole number, we can round up Brett's age to 15 in order to make Angela three years older than him: b = 15

To find the total amount Paul spent on driving his car for two weeks, we first need to find out how much he spends each day, and then multiply that by the number of days.

5. The cost of one day's driving (two rides) is $6 (morning) + $2 (afternoon) = $8.

Step 2: Calculate the number of Greek orange pies that can be made with the oranges brought by both Brianne and Ashley.
- One Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges.
- To find out how many pies can be made with the oranges brought by both Brianne and Ashley, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges required for one pie.
- Total number of oranges = 50 (Ashley's oranges) + 70 (Brianne's oranges) = <<50+70=120>>120

How . many guests , are : necessary for the two . venues to be equal in cost?
                 [/INST] To find out how many guests are needed for both venues to have equal cost, we need to compare the total cost at each venue.

Let's denote the number of guests at the first venue as x, and the number of guests at the second venue as y.

At the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest. So, the total cost at the first venue is:

$200 + $5x

At the second venue, the cost is $25 per person. So, the total cost at the second venue is:

$25y

To make the comparison, we need to set up an equation:

$200 + $5x = $25y

To solve for x in terms of y (or vice versa), we can use algebraic manipulation. Here's one way to do it:

$5x = $25y - $200
x = ($\frac{25}{5}$)y - ($\frac{200}{5}$)
x = 5y - 40

We can test the validity of the equation by checking a few values of y. For example, if there are 5 guests at the second venue:

x = 5(5) - 40
x = 25 - 40
x = -15

Since the number of guests can't be negative, we've made an error. The mistake is that we've subtracted $200 from y instead of adding it to the cost of food. The corrected equation is:

$5x = $25y + $200
x = 5y + 40

Now, we can find the number of guests for which both venues have equal cost. For example, if the second venue costs $450:

x = 5y + 40
x = 5(90) + 40
x = 450 + 40
x = 490

So, for the two venues to have equal cost when the second venue costs $450, there need to be 490 guests at the first venue.

{The final answer is: 490 guests}</s>","The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem
From the problem statement, we know that in total, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. We're also given that Lily collected 7 more insects than David, and David found half as many insects as Bodhi. The problem asks to find out how many insects Lily collected.

Step 2: Define variables
Let's denote the number of insects that David found as D and the number of insects that Bodhi found as B. Based on the problem statement, we have:

1. Lily found D + 7 insects
2. David found D insects
3. Bodhi found 2D insects (since David found half as many insects as Bodhi)

Step 3: Solve the equation
From the problem statement, we know that Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects in total. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43

Simplifying this equation:

3D + 7 = 43
3D = 36
D = 12

We now know that David found 12 insects.

Using this information, we can find out how many insects Lily found:

Lili's insects = David's insects + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19

Step 4: Answer the question
{The final answer is}: Lily found 19 insects.</s>","Let B = the number of insects Bodhi collected
David = B/2
Lily = B/2 + 7
B + B + 7 = 43
2B = <<36=36>>36
B = <<18=18>>18 insects
David = 18/2 = <<18/2=9>>9 insects
Lily = 9 + 7 = <<9+7=16>>16 insects
Lily found <<16=16>>16 insects.

First, let's find out how many yards Mariah used. We know that she used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Each skein has 364 yards, so the number of yards in a quarter skein is:

Yards used by Mariah = 1/4 * Yards per skein
= 1/4 * 364
= 91 yards

Next, let's find out how many yards her grandma used. We know that she used 1/2 of a skein of yarn.

Yards used by grandma = 1/2 * Yards per skein
= 1/2 * 364
= 182 yards

To find the total number of yards they used, we add the yards Mariah used to the yards her grandma used.

Total yards used = Yards used by Mariah + Yards used by grandma
= 91 yards + 182 yards
= 273 yards

{The final answer is 273 yards of yarn used altogether.}</s>","Mariah’s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.
Now that there are common denominators, we can add the 1/4 skein of yarn Mariah used + 2/4 skein of yarn her grandma used = 3/4 of a skein of yarn.

3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug

First, let's find the width of the rug:
1. The rug is 0.5 feet wider than the chair
2. The chair is 3 feet wide

Rug width = Chair width + 0.5 feet
Rug width = 3 feet + 0.5 feet
Rug width = 3.5 feet

Now, we need to find the length of the couch:
1. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug
2. The width of the rug is 3.5 feet

Length of the couch = 2 * Rug width + 2
Length of the couch = 2 * 3.5 ft + 2
Length of the couch = 7 ft + 2
Length of the couch = 9 feet

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how much Suzie spent on gum in total.
Suzie bought 4 packs of gum, 2 of which were strawberry. She spent $2 on a pack of grape gum and half that amount on a pack of green apple gum.
Total spent = $2 (strawberry gum) x 2 + $2 (grape gum) + $1 (green apple gum)
Total spent = $4 (strawberry gum) + $2 + $1
Total spent = $7

Step 2: Calculate the cost of one pack of strawberry gum.
Since Suzie spent $4 on two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of one pack is:
Cost of one pack of strawberry gum = Total spent on strawberry gum / Number of packs of strawberry gum
Cost of one pack of strawberry gum = $4 / 2
Cost of one pack of strawberry gum = $2

{The final answer is: Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.}</s>","The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.

- From a 2 x 4 piece of wood, Frederick can make 200 sticks.
- From a 2 x 8 piece of wood, Frederick can make 400 sticks.

Step 2: Find out which piece of wood is cheaper per stick, and how many sticks Frederick can buy with his budget.
A 2 x 4 costs $4, so the cost per stick is $4 / (number of sticks) = $0.02 per stick. However, Frederick can only buy 200 sticks from a 2 x 4.

A 2 x 8 costs $6, so the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick. Frederick can buy 400 sticks from a 2 x 8.

Since the cost per stick is lower when Frederick buys a 2 x 8, he can buy more sticks for his budget. The total cost for 400 sticks is $6, which is less than his budget of $24.

Step 3: Calculate how many sticks Frederick can make with 400 sticks. This amount doesn't matter, as the question only asks for the maximum number of sticks that can be made with the cheapest lumber.

                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many cows each farm and zoo have. We know that the farm has 30 cows and the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm.

Cows at the zoo = 2 * Cows at the farm
Cows at the zoo = 2 * 30
Cows at the zoo = 60

So, the farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 60 cows.

Next, we'll find out how many sheep each farm and zoo have. We know that the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.

Sheep at the farm = Sheep at the zoo / 2

Since the zoo has 20 sheep, we have:

Sheep at the farm = 20 / 2
Sheep at the farm = 10

Therefore, the farm has 10 sheep and the zoo has 20 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of animals from both the farm and the zoo:

Total Animals = Animals at the farm + Animals at the zoo
Total Animals = (Cows at the farm + Cows at the zoo) + (Sheep at the farm + Sheep at the zoo)

Sophia and Rose went to the market together. Rose bought a certain number of onions and potatoes. The problem provides us the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought, but it's not clear what the symbols '!', '?', and '?' represent.

Step 2: Analyze the given information.
Rose bought 4 times the number of onions as potatoes. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

Step 3: Define the variables.
Let's denote the number of onions Rose bought as x and the number of potatoes Rose bought as y.

Step 4: Use the given information to create equations.
From the problem, we know that:
x = 12
y = 4
And:
x = 4y

Step 5: Solve for one variable and substitute it back.
To solve for y, we first have to eliminate x from the equations. We can do this by using the equation x = 4y (since we know x = 12):
12 = 4y → y = 3

Now that we know y is 3, we can find x:
x = 4y
x = 4 * 3
x = 12

Step 6: Calculate the total number of onions and potatoes bought.
Since Sophia and Rose bought the same quantities, we can now find the total number of onions and potatoes they bought together.
Total onions = x + x = 2x
Total onions = 2 * 12
Total onions = 24

Total potatoes = y + y = 2y
Total potatoes = 2 * 3
Total potatoes = 6

Step 7: Present the final answer.
{The final answer is: Sophia and Rose bought a total of 24 onions and 6 potatoes from the market.}</s>","The number of onions Sophia bought is 12 / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 onions.

                 [/INST] To find out how many calories Andy needs to have in a deficit each day in order to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday on July 19th, follow these steps:

1. First, let's find out how many total calories Andy needs to burn to reach his goal weight. To lose 30 lbs., he needs to burn 35,000 calories (30 lbs * 3500 calories per lb).

2. Since there are approximately 30 days between December 31st (current date) and July 19th, we can calculate the daily calorie deficit by dividing the total calories to be burned by the number of days.

3. Find the number of days between December 31st and July 19th:
   a. January: 31 days
   b. February: 28 days
   c. March: 31 days
   d. April: 30 days
   e. May: 31 days
   f. June: 30 days
   g. July: 19 days
   Total: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 210 days

   Important note: This calculation assumes a leap year, as February 2024 has 29 days instead of the usual 28. Since the question doesn't specify whether it's a leap year or not, the actual number of days might be slightly different depending on the real situation.

4. Calculate the daily calorie deficit: Calories to burn = 35,000 calories / 210 days = 166.67 calories/day (rounding up to 167 calories/day to be safe and consider weekends where he might consume more calories).

5. The calculation above assumes Andy maintains his current weight throughout the entire period. However, if Andy starts at his initial weight (the weight he wants to reach by his birthday) and loses weight each day, the daily calorie deficit should be slightly smaller since losing less weight would require fewer calories burned. In this case, we would need to adjust the daily calorie deficit calculation based on the starting weight.

The final answer is: To lose 30 lbs. by July 19th if he burns 3500 calories per pound, Andy should aim for a daily calorie deficit of about 167 calories. This is assuming he maintains his current weight throughout the entire period. If he starts at his goal weight, the daily calorie deficit number might be slightly smaller depending on the actual number of days between December 31st and July 19th in a specific year.</s>","January, March, and May have 31 days, February has 28, and April and June have 30, and Andy's birthday is on the 19th day of July. So there are 3 * 31 days + 28 + 2 * 30 days + 19 days = 93 days + 28 + 60 days + 19 days = <<3*31+28+2*30+19=200>>200 days until Andy's birthday.
He wants to lose 30 lbs. At 3500 calories per pound, this is 30 * 3500 = <<30*3500=105000>>105,000 calories total,
To reach his goal, he will have to burn 105,000 calories / 200 days = <<105000/200=525>>525 calories per day more than he consumes.

                 [/INST] To find out how much money Gerald has left after working for a week and spending $100, we first need to determine how many days he worked in a week and calculate his earnings.

1. We know Gerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day.
2. He worked for an entire week but the number of days in a week is not explicitly given. Assuming a standard work week of 5 days, Gerald's earnings for a week would be:
   Earnings in a week = Earnings per day * Number of days in a week
                            = $30 * 5
                            = $150

3. However, the problem states that Gerald spent a total of $100. This means his earnings for the week must have been $150 + $100 = $250. Thus, the number of days Gerald worked in a week was:
   Number of days = Earnings in a week / Earnings per day
                       = $250 / $30
                       = 8.33 days

4. Since Gerald can't work for a fraction of a day, he must have taken a day off during the week or worked overtime on some days to earn $250.

5. To find out how much money Gerald has left, we subtract his spending from his earnings:
   Money left = Earnings in a week - Spending
                  = $250 - $100
                  = $150

Therefore, {The final answer is $150}.</s>","He earns $30 daily for a week (7 days) for a total earnings of $30*7 = $<<30*7=210>>210

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. We know that the house and lot cost a total of $120,000. Let's denote the cost of the house as H and the cost of the lot as L.
2. From the problem statement, we are told that the house costs three times as much as the lot: H = 3L.
3. We also know that the total cost of the house and lot is $120,000, so H + L = $120,000.
4. To isolate the variable H (the cost of the house), we need to get rid of the L term in the equation. We can do this by subtracting L from both sides of the equation: H = 3L - L.
5. Simplifying this expression, we get H = 2L.
6. Now we have an equation relating the cost of the house (H) and the cost of the lot (L). We need to find the value of L to determine the cost of the house. Unfortunately, the problem statement does not provide enough information to do so directly.
7. Therefore, there is no definitive answer to this question. The problem statement does not provide sufficient information to determine the cost of the house or the lot independently.

{The final answer is: Unfortunately, there is no definitive answer to this question as there is not enough information provided to determine the cost of the house or the lot independently.}</s>","Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.
The cost of the house is 3/4 of the total cost, which is $120,000. 3/4 * $120,000 = $<<3/4*120000=90000>>90,000.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the cost of one pack of bags for Tara.
Cost of one pack = Number of bags per pack * Price per pack
Cost of one pack = 5 bags * $4/pack
Cost of one pack = $20

Step 2: Find the cost of all the packs Tara bought.
Cost of bags purchased = Number of packs bought * Cost of one pack
Cost of bags purchased = 8 packs * $20/pack
Cost of bags purchased = $160

Step 3: Find the selling price of one painted bag.
Selling price of one bag = Price at craft fair
Selling price of one bag = $8

Step 4: Find the total revenue Tara earned by selling all the painted bags.
Total revenue = Number of bags sold * Selling price of one bag
Because Tara sold as many bags as she bought, we know the total number of bags she sold was 40 (8 packs * 5 bags/pack).
Total revenue = 40 bags * $8/bag
Total revenue = $320

Step 5: Find the profit for Tara.
Profit = Total revenue - Cost of bags purchased
Profit = $320 - $160
Profit = $160

                 [/INST] To find the total number of punches Joe threw during the fight, we need to find out how many punches he throws in one round, and then multiply that by the total number of rounds in the fight.

First, we know that Joe throws 25 punches per minute. Since each round lasts 3 minutes, we can find out how many punches Joe throws in one round by multiplying his punching rate by the length of one round in minutes:

1. Number of punches thrown in one round = Punching rate per minute * Length of round in minutes
   = 25 punches/minute * 3 minutes
   = 75 punches

Therefore, in each round, Joe throws a total of 75 punches.

Next, we need to find out the total number of punches Joe threw during the entire fight, which consists of 5 rounds. We can do this by multiplying the number of punches Joe throws in one round by the total number of rounds:

2. Total number of punches thrown = Number of punches thrown in one round * Total number of rounds
   = 75 punches * 5 rounds
   = 375 punches

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.
On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. So, he completed 12 * 3 = <<12*3=36>>36 problems.
On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining problems. Let's denote the remaining problems as R. Then, he completed R/4 problems on Wednesday.

Now, we can calculate the number of problems Chris has completed in total:
12 (Monday) + 36 (Tuesday) + R (Wednesday)

To find R, we need to know that the total number of problems is 100. So, the total number of problems Chris has completed is:
12 + 36 + R = 48 + R

Since the number of problems he completed on Monday and Tuesday is known, the number of problems he has left to complete is:
100 - (48 + R)

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining problems. Thus, R = 100 - (48 + R) / 4

Solving this equation for R, we have:

52 + R = 100
R = 48

So, Chris has completed 48 problems, and he has 52 problems left to complete:

The final answer is: 52 math problems are left for Chris to complete on Thursday.</s>","On Tuesday he completes 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 math problems.

Step 2: Calculate the total quarts picked per hour by all three.
Total quarts picked per hour = Quarts picked by Tony + Quarts picked by Bobby + Quarts picked by Kathy + Quarts picked by Ricky
Total quarts picked per hour = 6 quarts + 5 quarts + 10 quarts + 8 quarts
Total quarts picked per hour = 29 quarts.

The final answer is: 29 quarts.</s>","Bobby picks one fewer quart of strawberries per hour than the 6 quarts of berries per hour that Tony can pick, for a total of 6-1=<<6-1=5>>5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, for a total of 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, or a total of 10-2=8 quarts per hour. Thus, in total, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick 6+5+10+8=<<6+5+10+8=29>>29 quarts of strawberries per hour.

93 loaves sold in the morning + 39 loaves sold in the afternoon = 132 loaves sold
6 loaves returned = 126 loaves actually sold
So, 200 (baked) - 126 (sold) = 74 loaves remained unsold

Step 3: Add the number of unsold loaves back to the number of loaves sold to find the total number of loaves that have left the bakery.
132 (sold) + 74 (unsold) = 206 loaves

Next, let's find out how many rows Jackson can plant for each color with the number of tulips he bought:

Red tulips: Jackson bought 36 red tulips. We'll divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in one row: 36 / 6 = 6 rows

Blue tulips: Jackson bought 24 blue tulips. We'll divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in one row: 24 / 8 = 3 rows

1. Heather has a jumbo bag of raisins containing 27 cups.
2. She wants to use the raisins to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix.
3. A batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins.

First, let's find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with the entire bag of raisins:

1. Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins.
2. The jumbo bag contains 27 cups of raisins.
3. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by the number of cups needed for one batch: 27 cups / 3/4 cup/batch = 37.7 batches.
4. Since we cannot have a fraction of a batch, Heather can only make 37 batches of oatmeal cookies using the entire bag of raisins.

Now, we don't know how many cups of raisins are required for each serving of granola and snack mix, but we do know that the bag of raisins is to be divided equally among the three different foods. Therefore, we cannot directly determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make while also maintaining equal portions for granola and snack mix using the information provided.

{The final answer is: 37 batches of oatmeal cookies can be made using the entire bag of raisins, but the number of batches for each of the other foods cannot be determined with the given information.}</s>","Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.

                 [/INST] To find out how many hours it takes for five people to paint a whole house, we first need to find out how long it takes one person to paint half a house and then use that information to determine how long it would take five people to paint a whole house.

We know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. Let's find out how many hours are in 5 days.

1. We know there are 24 hours in a day.
2. So, the number of hours in 5 days is: 5 days * 24 hours/day = 120 hours

Therefore, it takes one person 120 hours to paint half a house.

Now, to find out how long it would take five people to paint a whole house, we can assume they can all work at the same time on different parts of the house. In this case, it would take them half the time it takes one person to paint half a house.

So, the time it takes five people to paint a whole house is: 120 hours (for one person painting half a house) / 2 (since five people are working simultaneously) = 60 hours.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can now find out how many days it would take five people to paint a whole house: 60 hours / 24 hours/day = 2.5 days.

However, since you can't have half a day, we need to round up to find the number of days when we consider that painting can start and end on any day, not just whole days. So, we'll add 1 day to our calculation: 3 days.

Finally, to find the number of hours it takes five people to paint a whole house, multiply the number of days by the number of hours in a day: 3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours.

{The final answer is: It takes 5 people 72 hours (or 3 days) to paint a whole house.}</s>","First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.
Since five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step:

Step 1: Understanding the information given
Ophelia and Jenna live in the same apartment building. Ophelia has 2 sofas fewer than the number of chairs she has, and Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Ophelia has 20 sofas.

Step 2: Determining the number of sofas for Jenna
 since Ophelia has 2 sofas fewer than her number of chairs, and Ophelia has 20 sofas. Therefore, Ophelia has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 22 chairs * 3 = 66 chairs.

Step 3: Determining the total number of sofas and chairs for Ophelia
Ophelia has 20 sofas, and as mentioned earlier, she has 22 chairs. So the total number of furniture items for Ophelia is 20 sofas + 22 chairs = 42 items.

Step 4: Determining the total number of sofas and chairs for Jenna
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 66 chairs. Since we already have the number of chairs for Jenna, we don't need to calculate the number of sofas again since the information given does not provide enough details to determine the number of sofas Jenna has.

Step 5: Summarizing the results
To summarize, we've calculated the total number of furniture items for Ophelia to be 42 (20 sofas + 22 chairs), and although we've determined the number of chairs for Jenna (66 chairs), we have no way of knowing the exact number of sofas she has based on the information given.

{The final answer is: Ophelia has a total of 42 sofas and chairs (20 sofas + 22 chairs), but the number of sofas Jenna has remains unknown.}</s>","If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, a total of 3*22 = <<3*22=66>>66 chairs
The total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 66+22 = <<66+22=88>>88
Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the total number of sofas she has is 66-2 = <<66-2=64>>64 sofas.
The total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is 64+20 = <<64+20=84>>84 sofas

                 [/INST] Let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

First, let's find the cost of the CD and the headphone set separately. We know that Tom bought one CD for $4 and spent a total of $48. So, the cost of one CD is $4, and the cost of the headphone set is:

$48 (total amount spent) - $4 (cost of one CD) = $44

Since we don't know the cost of the headphone set directly, we found the difference between the total amount spent and the cost of one CD to determine the cost of the headphone set.

Now, let's figure out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't spent $44 on the headphone set. We'll do this by dividing the total amount Tom had initially by the cost of one CD:

$48 (initial amount of money Tom had) / $4 (cost of one CD) = 12

So, Tom could have bought 12 CDs with the initial $48 he had.

To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't spent $44 on the headphone set, we'll subtract the number of CDs Tom actually bought from the number he could have bought:

12 (CDs Tom could have bought) - 1 (CD Tom actually bought) = 11

{The final answer is: Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.}</s>","The headphone set cost was 48 - 4 = $<<48-4=44>>44.
That means, for that money Tom would be able to buy 44 / 4 = <<44/4=11>>11 more CDs.

In 5 years, Jame's age will be: 27 + 5 = 32

In 8 years, the age of Jame's cousin will be: (his age in 3 years) + 8

We know that in 3 years, Jame will be 5 years older than his cousin: 27 + 5 = 32, and his cousin's age will be 32 - 5 = 27

So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin's age will be: 27 + 8 = 35

Now, we can calculate the difference in their ages: 32 (Jame's age in 5 years) - 35 (Jame's cousin's age in 8 years) = -3

However, since a negative result doesn't make sense in this context, we need to correct this by taking the absolute value of the difference, obtaining a result of 3. This indicates that Jame's cousin's age is currently 3 years younger than his, so the difference between their ages is 3 years.

- Errol's total spending = $2,400
- Cost of computer = $1,100
- Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400 = $700 (since the printer was $400 less than the computer)
- Number of monitors bought = ?

Step 2: Determine the cost of one monitor.
- From the given information, we know that Errol bought one computer, two monitors, and a printer, spending a total of $2,400.
- We also know the cost of the computer and the printer. Since each monitor was not given an individual price, we cannot directly determine their cost.
- However, we do know that the total cost of the computer, two monitors, and the printer is $2,400. Since the computer and printer costs are already known ($1,100 and $700, respectively), we can find the cost of two monitors by subtracting the cost of the computer and printer from the total spending:
  - $2,400 (total spending) - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600 (remaining amount spent on monitors)

Step 3: Divide the remaining amount spent on monitors by the number of monitors to find the cost of one monitor.
- Since there are two monitors, the cost of one monitor would be half of the remaining amount spent on monitors:
  - Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2 = $300 (per monitor in dollars)

{The final answer is $300 per monitor.}</s>","He paid 1100-400=<<1100-400=700>>700 for the printer.
He paid 2400-1100-700=<<2400-1100-700=600>>600 dollars for the monitors.
Each monitor costs 600/2=<<600/2=300>>300 dollars.

                 [/INST] 1. We start with the fact that twenty kids went on a school trip, and they participated in a scavenger hunt for seashells. The kids were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
2. The boys went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each.
3. If the girls brought an amount of seashells equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many, then we need to find out how many shells each girl brought:
   - The number of seashells brought by the girls = Number of seashells brought by the boys + 4 * Number of boys
   - Let's denote the number of boys as x. Then, the number of girls is also x.
   - The number of seashells brought by the boys is 60 * x.
   - The number of seashells brought by the girls is 60 * x + 4x.
   - We know that the total number of kids (and thus the number of girls) is 20, meaning that x = 10.
   - Substituting this value in the equation gives us:
     - 2x = 60x + 4x
   - Simplifying this equation results in x = 10.
   - Given that there are 10 boys, and each boy brought 60 shells, the boys brought a total of 600 shells.
   - Since there are 10 girls, and the number of seashells each girl brought is equal to the number of seashells brought by each boy plus four times as many, we have:
     - Number of seashells brought by one girl = 60 + 4 * 60
4. Therefore, each girl brought {130} seashells. {The final answer is 130}

To recap, we used the given information and performed some calculations based on the provided equation to determine the number of seashells each girl brought. The final answer is 130.</s>","When they divided, each group had 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 students.
The total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10*60 = <<10*60=600>>600
The girls brought four times more seashells than the boys, which is 4*600 = <<4*600=2400>>2400
The total number of seashells brought by the girls is 2400+600 = <<2400+600=3000>>3000
If there were 10 girls, then each girl brought 3000/10 = <<3000/10=300>>300 seashells

1. We know that Nick had twice as many candies as George. Let's call the number of candies George had ""g."" Then Nick had ""2g"" candies.

2. George ate 5 candies, so now he has ""g - 5"" candies left.

3. We want to find out how many candies Nick has now. Since Nick initially had twice as many candies as George, and George now has ""g - 5"" candies, Nick must have had ""2(g - 5)"" candies initially.

4. To find Nick's current number of candies, we can subtract the candies George ate from the initial candies Nick had: ""2g - (g - 5)""

5. Simplifying the equation above: ""2g - g + 5""

6. Combining like terms: ""g + 5""

7. Therefore, Nick currently has ""g + 5"" candies. Since we don't have a specific value for ""g,"" we can't provide a numeric final answer. However, we know that Nick has ""g + 5"" candies, where ""g"" is the initial number of candies George had. {The final answer is g + 5, where g is the initial number of candies George had}</s>","George has 3 candies now but he already ate 5. So he had 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 candies at the start.
Nick had twice as many candies as George, so he had 2 * 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 candies originally.

So, the total number of vlogs Emma made in the first two weeks is:
18 (week 1) + 21 (week 2) = 39 vlogs

Since she typically makes 72 vlogs per month, we need to find out how many vlogs she should make in the third week to reach her goal:

Total number of vlogs needed per month = 72
Vlogs made in the first two weeks = 39

Now we'll calculate the number of vlogs she needs to make in the third week:

72 (total vlogs per month) - 39 (vlogs made in weeks 1 and 2) = 33 vlogs

3. The second boy adds $10 to his initial share of $6, so his new total is $6 + $10 = $16.

4. The eldest boy spends $8, so his remaining balance is $11 - $8 = $3.

5. He saves some money and is able to triple his remaining balance after spending the $8, so he had $3 * 3 = $9 saved.

                 [/INST] To find out how much Elvis needs to save daily in the second half of the month to reach his monthly saving target, we first need to find his saving target in a day. Let's calculate that:

1. Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125.
2. We need to find out how much he should save daily to reach this monthly target.
3. Divide the monthly saving target ($1125) by the number of days in a month.

let x = the number of days in a month
Monthly saving target = 1125$
daily savings = Monthly saving target / x

Now we know that Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month compared to the first half. We assume that there are 'y' days in the second half of the month:

1. Elvis saves 'a' dollars each day in the first half of the month.
2. He wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month.
3. So, he saves '2a' dollars each day in the second half of the month.

We know that the total monthly saving target is equal to the sum of savings in both halves. Let's find the relationship between the savings in the first and second halves:

Total monthly savings = Savings in first half + Savings in second half
1125$ = a * (x/2) + 2a * (x/2)

Now let's solve that equation for 'a':

2a * (x/2) = 1125$ - a * (x/2)
a = 1125$ / (x) - (2a) / 2

Solving for 'a':
a = (2250$ / x)

Since we need to find the savings in the second half of the month, which is '2a':
2a = 2 * (2250$ / x) = 4500$ / x

Now we need to find the number of days 'y' in the second half of the month. We know that the second half of the month has half the number of days as the whole month:

y = x / 2

Substitute x back into the equation for the savings per day in the second half:

2a = 4500$ / (x / 2)
2a = 9000$ / x

To find the savings per day in the second half, divide the whole equation by 2:

a = 4500$ / (2 * x) = 2250$ / x = 2250$ / (x / 2) = 2250$ / y

Therefore, Elvis needs to save 2250$ / y dollars daily in the second half of the month to reach his monthly saving target.

{The final answer is: Elvis needs to save 2250$ / y dollars daily in the second half of the month.}

(Note: It is assumed that the month has an even number of days for the problem to make sense.)</s>","Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y
Since y is twice as much what he saved in each day of the first half, he saved y/2 in each day of the first half
April has 30 days, 15 days in each half, so he is saving (15*(y/2)) in the 1st half, (15*y) in the 2nd half to give (15*(y/2))+(15*y)=$1125
Solving the equation gives 15(3y/2) = $1125

Step 1: Calculate how much Jairus earns by finishing 20 tasks:
Jairus' earnings per task = $0.8
Number of tasks = 20

Jairus' earnings = Earnings per task * Number of tasks
Jairus' earnings = $0.8 * 20
Jairus' earnings = $16

Step 2: Calculate how much Jenny earns by finishing 20 tasks:
Jenny's earnings per task = $0.5
Number of tasks = 20

Jenny's earnings = Earnings per task * Number of tasks
Jenny's earnings = $0.5 * 20
Jenny's earnings = $10

Step 3: Find the difference between Jairus' and Jenny's earnings:
Difference = Jairus' earnings - Jenny's earnings
Difference = $16 - $10

The final answer is: $6.

Therefore, Jairus will make $6 more than Jenny when each of them finishes 20 tasks.</s>","The difference of the amount received by Jairus and Jenny is $0.8/task - $0.5/task = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3/task.

3. Similarly, each of the families contacted in the second round will call 3 other families. So, in the third round, 3 families contacted in the second round will contact 3 other families each, that is, 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>3 families.

Now, let us find out how many families will be contacted in the fourth round. The families contacted in the third round will each call 3 other families.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the given information
Jonathan wants to create a play set that is five times larger than James's play set, which has 80 toys. Jonathan currently has less than enough toys to make this play set. He needs 2 more toys than he already has.

Step 2: Calculate the number of toys Jonathan needs in his play set
Jonathan's play set should be five times larger than James's play set, which has 80 toys:
5 * 80 = 400 toys

Step 3: Determine how many toys Jonathan has
We know Jonathan currently has less than 400 toys and needs 2 more toys. So let's find out how many toys he has:
1. Let's assume Jonathan has x toys
2. We know that he needs x + 2 toys to have enough for his play set.
3. Setting up an equation based on the given information, we have: x < 400 and x + 2 > 400
4. Solving this inequality, we find that x < 398 and x + 2 > 400, leading to the contradiction that x cannot be a number that fits the given conditions.
5. Since our assumption that x < 400 is not valid, let's try the next smallest number below 400.
6. If x = 397, then x + 2 = 399, which is still less than 400, and Jonathan would have 399 toys, which is still not enough for his play set.
7. Let's try x = 396. In this case, x + 2 = 398, which meets the requirement that Jonathan has fewer toys than he needs but more than the number given in the question.

So, Jonathan currently has 396 toys.

The final answer is: Jonathan currently has 396 toys.</s>","Five times as large as James's set of play, which has 80 toys, is 5*80 = <<5*80=400>>400 toys.

- The cost of 10 packs of potato fries at $0.30 each is 10 * $0.30 = $3
- The cost of 5 cans of fruit drinks at $2 each is 5 * $2 = $10
- The total cost is $20 (hamburgers) + $3 (potato fries) + $10 (fruit drinks) = $33

Step 2: Calculate the amount of change Carly gets when she pays using a $50 bill.

                 [/INST] To find the amount of money Antonella earns from selling goods worth $2500, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the base commission and the additional commission.

Part 1: Base commission
If goods worth $1000 are sold, and a 30% commission is earned, then the amount of the base commission is:

Base commission = Sales amount * Commission percentage
Base commission = $1000 * 0.3
Base commission = $300

Part 2: Additional commission
Since goods worth $2500 are being sold, this amount exceeds the $1000 threshold. The additional commission is 10% of the amount above $1000.

Additional sales amount = Sales amount - Base sales amount
Additional sales amount = $2500 - $1000
Additional sales amount = $1500

Additional commission = Additional sales amount * Commission percentage
Additional commission = $1500 * 0.1
Additional commission = $150

So, Antonella earned a base commission of $300 and an additional commission of $150.

The final answer is: Antonella earned a total of $450 ( $300 + $150 ) from selling goods worth $2500.</s>","Since Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, she got the first 30% commission, which is 30/100*$1000 = $<<30/100*1000=300>>300
Since goods worth over $1000 earn you a 10% commission, she was entitled to earn an additional 10% commission per $500 on $2500-$1000 = $1500 worth of goods.
This amounts to $1500 * 10% = $<<1500*10*.01=150>>150
In total, Antonella earned $300 from the first commission and $150 from the second commission for a total of $150 + $300 = $<<300+150=450>>450

The problem states that when the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as it takes him to swim a mile in cold water.

Step 2: Find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water
1. We know it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water
2. In warm water, it takes him 2 minutes more than twice as long
3. Let's call the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water x
4. We know that x = 16 * 1.5 (since it's 1.5 times as long as 16 minutes)
5. Solving for x, we find that x = 24 minutes

Step 3: Find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water
1. We know it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water
2. To find the time it takes him to swim 3 miles in cold water, we simply multiply the time it takes to swim a mile (16 minutes) by 3
3. The time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water is 16 * 3 = 48 minutes

Step 4: Find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water
1. We know it takes Ray 24 minutes to swim a mile in warm water
2. To find the time it takes him to swim 3 miles in warm water, we multiply the time it takes to swim a mile in warm water by 3
3. The time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water is 24 * 3 = 72 minutes

Step 5: Find out the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in cold water and swimming 3 miles in warm water
1. We found that it takes Ray 48 minutes to swim 3 miles in cold water and 72 minutes to swim 3 miles in warm water
2. The difference in time is therefore 72 minutes (warm) - 48 minutes (cold) = 24 minutes

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We have a bag with a total of 21 buttons.
2. There were 7 buttons with two holes each. So, the number of holes in these buttons is 2 * 7 = 14.
3. The remaining buttons had four holes each. Let's find out how many buttons had four holes. First, let's find out how many buttons were in the bag in total: 21 (initial buttons) - 14 (buttons with two holes) = 7 buttons were left.
4. Each of these buttons had 4 holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 4 * 7 = 28 holes.
5. To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we add the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes: 14 (buttons with two holes) * 2 (holes per button) + 7 (buttons with four holes) * 4 (holes per button) = 28 + 28 = 56 holes in total.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of cups Octavia drinks daily.
From the problem, it's mentioned that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. We need to find out what the daily recommended cups of coffee are to find out how many cups Octavia drinks.

The daily recommended amount of coffee for an adult is around 4 cups (approximately 950 ml), according to the Mayo Clinic.

Since Octavia drinks half of that, her daily coffee intake is:

Octavia's daily coffee intake = 0.5 * Recommended daily coffee intake
Octavia's daily coffee intake = 0.5 * 4 cups
Octavia's daily coffee intake = 2 cups

Step 2: Determine Juan's daily coffee intake.
Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so:

Juan's daily coffee intake = Octavia's daily coffee intake * 10
Juan's daily coffee intake = 2 cups * 10
Juan's daily coffee intake = 20 cups

Step 3: Calculate the reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake.
Juan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake to the recommended daily amount of 4 cups. To find out how many cups he needs to reduce, subtract his current intake from the recommended intake:

Reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake = Juan's daily coffee intake - Recommended daily coffee intake
Reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake = 20 cups - 4 cups
Reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake = 16 cups

{The final answer is: Juan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.}</s>","Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups
Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which translates to 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups
Subtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan’s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups
Juan must therefore reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups

From the problem, we know that:
1. Mark weighs 150 pounds, so M = 150.
2. Susan weighs less than Mark, so S < 150.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so B = 2S.

We want to find the average weight of the three friends. The average weight is given by the sum of their weights divided by the total number of friends:

Average weight = (M + S + B) / 3

Substitute the values for M and B in terms of S:

Average weight = (150 + S + 2S) / 3

Simplify the expression:

Average weight = (150 + 3S) / 3

To find the average weight, we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of S. However, we know that S < 150 since Susan weighs less than Mark.

                 [/INST] To find the angle of the sun from the ground when standing at the entrance of Sahir's house and the sun has moved for 10 hours, we need to apply some trigonometric calculations. Let's denote the following variables:

* λ: The initial angle of the sun's position above the horizon (32°)
* θ: The angle of the sun's position above the ground at the entrance of Sahir's house
* τ: The time the sun has moved for in hours (10 hours)

First, let us find the angle θ using the given angles and time. We know that the angle λ represents the angle of the sun above the horizon at the start, and the angle θ represents the angle of the sun above the ground at the entrance of Sahir's house.

Since the sun moves at an angle of 5 degrees per hour (relative to a horizontal line) and for 10 hours, the sun's angle change will be 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Thus, we can use the following right triangle relationship to find the angle θ:

sin(θ) = sin(λ) * cos(α) + cos(λ) * sin(α) * sin(θ_vertical)

where α is the angle between the sun's position at the pyramid and the ground (in this case, 32°), and θ_vertical is the sun's vertical angle (the angle it makes with the vertical) after moving for 10 hours. Since the sun is moving directly upward during the time frame given, we can assume θ_vertical = θ.

First, let us calculate sin(λ) and cos(λ), using the fact that sin²(λ) + cos²(λ) = 1:

sin(λ) = sin(32°) = 0.5553295
cos(λ) = sqrt(1 - sin²(λ)) = 0.8131326

Now, we can use the equations above, and the assumption that θ_vertical = θ:

sin(θ) = sin(32°) * cos(θ) + cos(32°) * sin(θ) * sin(θ)
sin(θ) = 0.5553295 * 1 + 0.8131326 * sin(θ) * sin(5° * 10)
sin(θ) = 0.5553295 + 0.8131326 * sin(50°)
sin(θ) ≈ 0.9269661

Using the inverse sine function, we can find the angle θ:

θ ≈ arcsin(0.9269661) ≈ 60.141°

Now, since the sun's angle above the ground (without considering Sahir's house entrance positioning) is given as λ = 32°, to find the final angle between the sun and the ground at Sahir's entrance (when the sun has moved for 10 hours), we need to add the angle θ to λ:

θ_final = λ + θ ≈ 32° + 60.141° ≈ 92.141°

We need to convert this result to degrees, which is found by adding 180° to the previous result and then taking the difference with 180°:

θ_final = 92.141° - 180° + 180° = 92.141° - 180° + 180° = 92.141° - 360° + 180° = -167.859° + 180° = 12.141°

Therefore, the final answer is that the sun will be approximately 12.141° degrees away from the ground.</s>","5 degrees an hour for 10 hours 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 degrees

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first week, Judy reads for 15 minutes each night. So, the total number of minutes she reads in a week is: 15 minutes/night × 7 nights/week = 105 minutes/week. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to pages by using the given rate of 2 pages per 1.5 minutes: 105 minutes/week ÷ (2 pages/1.5 minutes) × 1.5 minutes/minute = 70 pages/week.

2. In the second week, Judy reads a total of 100 pages. Since we already know her weekly reading rate is 70 pages/week, this means she has exceeded her usual reading limit by 30 pages. However, the problem doesn't ask us to determine why or how she read these extra 30 pages, so we'll focus on finding the total number of pages she read in the two weeks.

3. We know she reads 70 pages/week, so the number of pages she reads in two weeks is 70 pages/week × 2 weeks = 140 pages.

{The final answer is 140 pages.}</s>","Every night, Judy reads 15 minutes/1.5 minutes = <<15/1.5=10>>10 sets of 2 pages.
So, she read 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 pages every night in the first week.
In the first week, she reads a total of 20 x 7 = <<20*7=140>>140 pages.
Therefore, she read a total of 140 + 100 = <<140+100=240>>240 pages in two weeks.

                 [/INST] Let's call the number of sandwiches that Cody and Trevor had initially as ""x"". Therefore, we have:

x = 12 (The total number of sandwiches)

Now, Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is:

Cody's share = x / 3

And Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is:

Trevor's share = x / 4

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to find the remaining sandwiches for both Cody and Trevor and then add them together.

Cody's remaining sandwiches = x / 3
Trevor's remaining sandwiches = x / 4

Total remaining sandwiches = Cody's remaining sandwiches + Trevor's remaining sandwiches

Total remaining sandwiches = (x / 3) + (x / 4)

To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator of 3 and 4 is 12. Hence, we get:

Total remaining sandwiches = (4x / 12) + (3x / 12)

We can simplify it by removing the common factor (x) and 12 from the denominator:

Total remaining sandwiches = (4 + 3) / 12

Total remaining sandwiches = 7 / 12

However, this answer is not in its simplest form because 7 and 12 have a common factor other than 1. We need to find the common factor and divide both the numerator and the denominator by it to simplify our answer. The common factor of 7 and 12 is 7.

Total remaining sandwiches = 1 (simplifying the numerator) x (7 / 12 (simplifying the denominator))

We get:

Total remaining sandwiches = 7 / 12

So, we cannot simplify our answer to a whole number. The final answer is that there is 7/12 or approximately 0.5833 of the sandwiches left.

However, this answer might not be practical when calculating with physical objects like sandwiches, so if we need a whole number, we could round to the nearest reasonable number or interpret our answer as a portion of the total.

Let X be the age of Shiloh's nephew today.

We know that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So we can write the equation:

Shiloh's age in 7 years = 3 * (Shiloh's nephew's age + 7)

44 (Shiloh's age today) = 3 * (X + 7)

Now, let's solve for X:

44 = 3 * (X + 7)

Divide both sides by 3:

14.67 (approximately, since we cannot have a fraction of a year for a person's age) = X + 7

Subtract 7 from both sides:

X ≈ 7.67

Since we cannot have a fraction of a year for someone's age, let's round down to X = 7.

Now, let's check our solution:

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 3 * (7 + 7) = 3 * 14 = 42 years old.
So Shiloh is currently 42 - 7 = 35 years old, and his nephew is 7 years old.

Step 2: From the problem, we know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so his goal count is X + 20. And Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so her goal count is Y + 45.

Step 3: We also know that Richie scored a total of 80 goals. So, X + 20 = 80.

Step 4: To find out how many goals Mark scored, we can subtract 20 from Richie's goal count: X + 20 = 80 => X = 60. So Mark scored 60 goals.

Step 5: Similarly, to find Anna's goal count, we can subtract 45 from Richie's goal count: 80 - 20 - 45 = 15. So Anna score 15 goals.

Therefore, {The final answer is: Richie scored 80 goals, Mark scored 60 goals, and Anna scored 15 goals.}</s>","If Richie scored 80 goals, which is 20 more goals than Mark, Mark scored 80-20 = <<80-20=60>>60 goals.

Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna, which means Anna scored 80-45 = <<80-45=35>>35 goals.
All three teenagers scored 140+35 = <<140+35=175>>175 goals.

1. Liam made $63.
2. We don't know how many lemonades Liam sold, but we know the price was $4 per lemonade. To find out how many lemonades Liam sold, we can divide the total amount of money he made by the price per lemonade:

   $63 ÷ $4/lemonade = 15.75 (Since Liam can't sell a fraction of a lemonade, we'll round up to 16 lemonades)

3. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each:

   $4/lemonade × 21 lemonades = $84

4. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we can subtract Liam's sales from Mitchell's sales:

   $84 (Mitchell) - $63 (Liam) = $21

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many action figures Peter bought on the first part of the week (Sunday through Wednesday). He spent $70 on wooden action figures that cost $5 each:

Total wooden action figures = Budget for wooden figures / Cost per wooden figure
Total wooden action figures = $70 / $5
Total wooden action figures = 14

Next, let's calculate how many plastic action figures he will buy for the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday):

Budget for plastic figures = $70 (remaining after wooden figures)
Total plastic action figures = Budget for plastic figures / Cost per plastic figure
Total plastic action figures = $70 / $2
Total plastic action figures = 35

To find the total number of action figures Peter has by the end of the week, add the number of wooden and plastic action figures:

Total action figures = Total wooden action figures + Total plastic action figures
Total action figures = 14 + 35
Total action figures = 49

He will spend $40 on wooden action figures of $5 each which gives $40/$5 = <<40/5=8>>8 wooden action figures
For the remaining 3 days he will spend 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30

2. The cost for the kitten's vaccines was $20 each, and the kitten needed 3 vaccines.
3. The cost for one broken vase was $12, and the kitten broke 4 vases.

Now let's calculate the total cost step by step:

1. The cost for spaying is $200.
2. The cost for each vaccine is $20, and the number of vaccines needed is 3. So, the cost for the vaccines is $20 * 3 = $60.
3. The cost for one broken vase is $12, and the number of broken vases is 4. So, the cost for the broken vases is $12 * 4 = $48.

1. Ford grows 40 roses every week.
2. He supplies:
   a) 20 roses to the first flower shop,
   b) 15 roses to the second flower shop, and
   c) 30 roses to the third flower shop.

3. So, Ford needs to supply 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses every week.

4. Now, we need to find out how many roses Ford needs to grow in a month to meet their demand. We'll assume there are 4 weeks in a month (in reality, there are usually 4 or 5 weeks).

5. Ford needs to produce 65 roses every week, so he needs to grow 65 roses 4 weeks in a month: 65 x 4 = 260 roses in a month.

6. Ford currently grows 40 roses every week, which is equal to 160 roses every month (40 x 4).

7. Therefore, Ford lacks 260 - 160 = 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

Step 2: Find the cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00

Step 3: Find the selling price of one sandwich.

Now, since she uses 8 pieces to make one muffin:
Number of muffins = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces per muffin

Step 1: Calculate the cost of new carpet.
The area of the bedroom is 18 ft × 12 ft = 216 sq ft.
The cost per sq ft for new carpet is $12, so the cost of the new carpet is 216 sq ft × $12/sq ft = $2592.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of padding.
The area of the bedroom is 216 sq ft.
The cost per sq ft for padding is $2, so the cost of padding is 216 sq ft × $2/sq ft = $432.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of carpet removal.
The area of the bedroom is 216 sq ft.
The cost per sq ft for removal is $4, so the cost of removal is 216 sq ft × $4/sq ft = $864.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of carpet installation.
The area of the bedroom is 216 sq ft.
The cost per sq ft for installation is $34, so the cost of installation is 216 sq ft × $34/sq ft = $7248.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet.
The total cost is the sum of the cost of the new carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 (new carpet) + $432 (padding) + $864 (removal) + $7248 (installation) = $10,546.

The new carpet padding costs $2 * 216 = $<<2*216=432>>432.
To remove the old carpet, the contractor will charge $4 * 216 = $<<4*216=864>>864.
To install the new carpet, the contractor will charge $34 * 216 = $<<34*216=7344>>7,344.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We start with the initial value of the number train, which is given as $20$.
2. The problem states that this value is ""plus half the number,"" so we need to find half of the number first. Let's call the number we're looking for ""n"". Thus, half the number is $n/2$.
3. We then divide the sum of the initial value and half the number by 5: $(20 + (n/2)) / 5$
4. The next step is to multiply the resulting value by the initial value minus 12: $([(20 + (n/2)) / 5] \times (20 - 12))$
5. To find the final value of the number train, we need to find the value of ""n"" that satisfies this equation. Since the problem doesn't provide enough information to determine the exact value of ""n,"" there isn't a single definitive answer.

Therefore, the problem doesn't have a clear answer, as it relies on an unknown value (n). The final answer is inconclusive.

{The final answer is inconclusive.}</s>","If Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20, half the number is 1/2*20=<<20-10=10>>10
The starting value plus half the number is 20+10=<<20+10=30>>30
This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5, giving a total of 30/5 = <<30/5=6>>6
The starting value minus 12 is 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8
The resulting value after dividing by 5 was times by the starting value minus 12, a total of 8*6 = <<8*6=48>>48

                 [/INST] Let's call the number of cards the boy has ""x"". Since his brother has 3 fewer cards, the brother has x - 3 cards. The question asks for the total number of cards they have together, so we simply add the number of cards each of them has:

x (boy's cards) + (x-3) (brother's cards)

To find the answer, we need to find the value of x that makes this equation true. We don't have enough information to find an exact value for x, but we do know that x is a number that results in both the boy and the brother having valid numbers of cards. Since the boy has at least 5 cards (as stated in the problem), and his brother must have at least 3 cards (3 fewer than the boy), the total number of cards they have together must be greater than or equal to 8.

For example, if the boy has 5 cards, then the brother has 2 cards (5-3), and together they have 7 cards. But they could also have more cards; for instance, if the boy has 10 cards, then the brother has 7 cards, and together they have 17 cards.

So, the answer to this problem is that they have at least 8 cards together. However, the true number depends on the specific number of cards each person has.

                 [/INST] To find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to achieve a desired temperature of 520 degrees, we first need to determine the percentage by which her oven is off. Then, we can calculate the adjusted temperature by adding the percentage error to the desired temperature.

Step 1: Calculate the percentage error.
The percentage error is the absolute difference between the desired temperature and the actual temperature, divided by the desired temperature.

Percentage error = | (Desired temperature - Actual temperature) / Desired temperature |
Percentage error = | (520 - 468) / 520 |

Step 2: Determine the percentage error.
Using the formula from step 1:

Percentage error = | (520 - 468) / 520 |
Percentage error ≈ | 0.1114 |
Percentage error ≈ 11.14%

So, her oven is 11.14% too low.

Step 3: Find the adjusted temperature.
Now, we need to calculate the temperature Maggie should set her oven to in order to reach a temperature of 520 degrees with a 11.14% error:

Adjusted temperature = Desired temperature * (1 + Percentage error)
Adjusted temperature = 520 * (1 + 0.1114)

Step 4: Calculate Maggie's adjusted temperature.
Using the formula from step 3:

Adjusted temperature = 520 * (1 + 0.1114)
Adjusted temperature = 520 * 1.1114
Adjusted temperature ≈ 573.99

Step 5: Find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to.
Since she can't set her oven to a decimal temperature, the closest feasible setting would be the nearest integer to her adjusted temperature.

Adjusted temperature round down = 573 -> 573

The closest feasible adjustment for a temperature of 520 degrees would be for Maggie to set her oven to 573 degrees.

{The final answer is: Maggie should set her oven to 573 degrees to achieve a temperature of 520 degrees in her recipe.}</s>","The oven off by 18 degrees because 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18
The oven is off by 4% because 18 / 450 x 100 = <<18/450*100=4>>4%
Therefore X + .04X = 520
Therefore 1.04X = 520

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understanding the given information.
Judy bought a certain number of cups and dishes for a church event. Her cups number is given in dozens, and she bought twice as many dishes as cups. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes.

Step 2: Finding the number of Judy's cups.
Given that Judy bought ""a certain number of cups in dozens,"" let's assume she bought x dozens of cups. Therefore, she bought x*12 cups in total (since there are 12 cups in a dozen).

Step 3: Finding the number of Judy's dishes.
Since she bought dishes that are ""twice as many"" as her cups, she bought 2x*12 dishes.

Step 4: Finding the number of her friend's dishes.
We're told that her friend brought 40 cups and ""20 more dishes."" Since Judy's dishes number is 2x*12, we'll determine the value of x, then calculate her friend's dishes number:

1) To find x, let's equate the number of cups:
x*12 = 40
x = 40 / 12
x = 3.33, but we know x must be a number of dozens, so x = 3 (since 3*12 = 36, which is closest to 40 in a practical sense)

2) Given that her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, we can calculate the number of her friend's dishes as: 2*Judy's dishes number
2*2*(3*12) = 48*2 = 96 dishes

Step 5: Adding up the utensils.
Judy brought x*12 cups + 2x*12 dishes = 3*12*12 + 2*3*12*12 = 144 doz. cups + 72 doz. dishes = 216 doz. utensils
Her friend brought 40 cups + 96 dishes = 44 doz. utensils

The total number of utensils both brought is 216 doz. (Judy) + 44 doz. (her friend) = 260 doz. utensils.

{The final answer is: 260 dozen utensils}</s>","Judy brought a dozen cups, which is <<12=12>>12.

Her friend brought 24+ 20 = <<24+20=44>>44 dishes.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understanding the given information.
- Pete needs 90 contact lenses, which will last him for 45 days.
- One box contains 120 contact lenses.
- He currently needs to buy contacts every 45 days.
- Each box costs $100.00 and is currently 10% off.

Step 2: Calculating how many boxes Pete needs to buy to get 90 contact lenses.
- We know that one box contains 120 contact lenses.
- So, Pete needs 90 contact lenses, which means he needs 90/120 = 3/4 of a box. Since he can't buy a fraction of a box, he needs to round up and buy 2 boxes instead.

Step 3: Calculating the cost of buying 2 boxes without the discount.
- Each box costs $100.00.
- So, the cost of buying 2 boxes would be $100.00 * 2 = $<<100*2=200>>200.

Step 4: Applying the 10% discount.
- A discount of 10% on $200 results in a savings of $100.
- The total cost of the 2 boxes after the discount would be $200 - $100 = $<<200-100=100>>100.

Step 5: Calculating the cost of each pair of contacts after the discount.
- The cost of each pair of contacts before the discount was $120 (since there are 120 contact lenses in a box).
- After the discount, the cost of two boxes is $100.
- So, the cost of one pair of contacts after the discount is $100/(2*120) = $<<100/2/120=0.05833333333333333>>0.0583 (approximately)
- However, since contact lenses are sold in pairs, each pair should cost twice this amount.

Step 6: Calculating the final cost of each pair of contacts after the discount.
- Each pair of contacts costs $0.0583 * 2 = $<<0.0583*2=0.11666666666666667>>0.117 (approximately).

{The final answer is: each pair of contacts after the discount costs approximately $0.117.}</s>","Each box of contacts is $100.00 with 10% off so that's 100*.10 = $<<100*.10=10.00>>10.00 off

He buys 2 boxes and each box costs $90.00 so that's 2*90= $<<2*90=180.00>>180.00
1 box of contacts has 90 contacts and he buys 2 boxes so that's 90*2 = <<90*2=180>>180 contacts
He needs 1 contact for each eye and he has 180 contacts so that's 180/2 = <<180/2=90>>90 pairs of contacts

- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday: 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long on Sunday.
  - Since Jill worked 3 hours in total, John worked 3 hours on Saturday (2 * 3 = 6 hours).
  - John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
  - In total, John worked 6 hours on Saturday + 3 hours on Sunday = 9 hours.

Therefore, Tabitha paid a total of $10 an hour * 3 hours (Jill) + $10 an hour * 9 hours (John) = $30 for cleaning the attic and basement.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money each worker earned.
- Jill earned $10 an hour * 3 hours = $30.

1. Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.
2. Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour and Hannah spends 2 hours doing it, so she burns 500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories. Hannah needs to drink 100 ml * (1000 calories / 200 calories) = 5 liters (since 1 liter = 1000 ml, so 5 liter = 5000 ml).
3. Running burns 600 calories per hour and she spends 1 hour doing it, so she burns 600 calories. Hannah needs to drink 100 ml * (600 calories / 200 calories) = 3 liters.
4. Therefore, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 5 liters + 3 liters = 8 liters.

{The final answer is: Hannah needs to drink 8000 ml (8 liters) of water}.

Note: In the steps above, I first calculated the water required based on calories burned during each activity in liters, and then added the amounts together to get the total water requirement.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that the jar contains red, blue, and green jelly beans in total quantities of 4500. However, we don't have the individual quantities for each color.

2. The note on the jar states that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

3. Let R be the number of red jelly beans, B be the number of blue jelly beans, and G be the number of green jelly beans.

4. We can set up two equations based on the information given in the note:

   - R = B - 1% of B
   - G = B + 1% of B

5. To find the difference between green and red jelly beans, we first need to find B.

6. Let X be the total number of blue jelly beans. Then, R = X - 1% of X, and G = X + 1% of X.

7. The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Thus, X = R + B + G.

8. Substitute the expressions for R and G from the equations in step 4 into this equation:

   - X = (X - 1% of X) + X + 1% of X

9. Simplify the equation:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem
Jared wants to find the average of his typing speed measurements after improving it twice. He starts with a speed of 47 WPM, then improves it to 52 WPM, and wants to improve it by 5 words per minute (WPM) one more time.

Step 2: Calculate Jared's new typing speed
To find Jared's new typing speed after improving it by an additional 5 WPM, we add the improvement to his current typing speed: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Step 3: Find the average of three typing speed measurements
To find the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to add the three WPM values and divide the sum by 3: (47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM) / 3

Step 4: Calculate the average
(150 WPM) / 3 = 50 WPM

{The final answer is: The average of Jared's typing speed measurements is 50 WPM.}</s>","Jared types at 52 WPM and increases it by 5 WPM, 52 + 5 = <<52+5=57>>57 WPM.
His average over all his measured words-per-minute is 47 + 52 + 57 = <<47+52+57=156>>156.
His total is 156 / 3 typing speeds = <<156/3=52>>52 WPM as Jared's average typing speed.

- Martin eats Cheerios: he loses 1.25 pounds/week
- Martin eats donuts: he gains 1.75 pounds/week

Step 2: Determine the difference in weight change per week.
The difference in weight change is the difference between the weight loss with Cheerios and the weight gain with donuts.
Difference in weight change = Weight loss with Cheerios - Weight gain with donuts
= -1.25 pounds/week - 1.75 pounds/week
= -3 pounds/week

Step 3: Calculate the difference in weight after 5 weeks for each option.
To find the difference in weight after 5 weeks, we can multiply the difference in weight change per week by the number of weeks.
Difference in weight after 5 weeks = Difference in weight change/week * Number of weeks
= -3 pounds/week * 5 weeks
= -15 pounds

Step 4: Determine the final weight for each option after 5 weeks.
To find the final weight for the Cheerios option, we add the initial weight to the weight loss after 5 weeks.
Final weight with Cheerios = Initial weight - Weight loss after 5 weeks
= Initial weight - (-15 pounds)
= Initial weight + 15 pounds

To find the final weight for the donuts option, we add the initial weight to the weight gain after 5 weeks.
Final weight with donuts = Initial weight + Weight gain after 5 weeks
= Initial weight + (1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks)
= Initial weight + 8.75 pounds

Step 5: Find the difference in final weights.
Difference in final weights = Final weight with Cheerios - Final weight with donuts
= (Initial weight + 15 pounds) - (Initial weight + 8.75 pounds)
= 15 pounds - 8.75 pounds
= 6.25 pounds

The final answer is: The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks will be 6.25 pounds between the two breakfast options.</s>","First find the difference in weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds/week - ( -1.25 pounds/week) = 1.75 pounds/week + 1.25 pounds/week = <<1.75-(-1.25)=3>>3 pounds/week
Then multiply the weight gain per week by the number of weeks to find the total difference at the end of 5 weeks: 5 weeks * 3 pounds/week = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds

Each invited person will bring 2 friends.

Step 3: Calculate the number of guests brought by each email invitee and their friends.
For each email invitee: 1 (invitee) + 2 (friends) = 3 guests.
For all 100 email invitees: 100 (invitees) × 3 (guests per invitee) = 300 guests.

Since the Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, its weight is 2x. The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so its weight is (1/4) * 2x = 0.5x.

Now we know that the Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon. So, the weight of the Mastiff is 44 * 0.5x = 22x.

We're given that the Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds, so x = 10. Using this value, we find that the Mastiff weighs 22 * 10 = 220 pounds.

The cost of boots on eBay is $13.

Step 4: Find the shipping cost on eBay.
We are told that the shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon. So, we first need to find the shipping cost on Amazon.

Step 5: Find the shipping cost on Amazon. (repeating step for clarity)
The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.

Step 6: Calculate the shipping cost on eBay.

                 [/INST] Step 1: The beanstalk Starting Height and Mark's Window Height
Given that the beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall and Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground, which is 20 feet + 4 feet (for the ground level) = 24 feet high.

Step 2: Doubling Height Every Day
We are told that the beanstalk doubles its height every day. Thus, we need to find out how much the height increases daily.

Step 3: Calculate Daily Height Increase
The difference in height between one day and the next is the daily increase: 24 feet (total height of window + initial beanstalk height) - 4 feet (initial beanstalk height) = 20 feet.

Step 4: Determine Number of Days to Reach the Desired Height
To determine the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than the window, we need to find out when its height equals or exceeds 24 feet. Let x be the number of days required:

Height after x days = Initial height * 2^x
Setting the height after x days equal to 24 feet:
2^x * 4 feet = 24 feet

Step 5: Calculate the Number of Days
We can calculate the number of days by taking the log base 2 of 6:
x = log base 2 of 16
x = 4

Alternatively, we can calculate it using an exponent:
2^x = 16
2^x = 2^4
x = 4

Step 6: The Final Answer
It will take the beanstalk 4 days to be taller than Mark's window. {The final answer is 4 days}.</s>","To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet
To find its height after two days, multiply the height after one day by 2: 8 feet * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 feet
To find its height after three days, multiply the height after two days by 2: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. This is taller than the window, so it took three days for the beanstalk to pass the window.

Step 1: The weight of a cup of mushrooms is 100 grams.

Step 2: Each cup of mushrooms contains 3 grams of protein.

Step 3: John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.

Step 4: To find out how many grams of protein John gets in a day, we multiply the grams of mushrooms he consumes by the grams of protein in a cup of mushrooms: Protein in 1 day = 200 grams * 3 grams/cup = 600 grams

Step 5: To find out how many grams of protein John gets in a week, we multiply the protein he consumes in a day by the number of days in a week: Protein in 1 week = 600 grams/day * 7 days/week = 4200 grams

The final answer is: John gets 4200 grams or 4.2 kilograms of protein per week by eating mushrooms.</s>","He eats 200/100=<<200/100=2>>2 cups per day

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the variables and set up equations based on the given information.
Let's denote the current age of Jerry as J, and the age of Jerry 5 years ago as J_5.

From the problem statement, we have two equations:

1) J = 2 * A
2) J_5 = J - 5

Step 2: Solve one equation for one variable to express it in terms of the other variable.
Let's solve the first equation for A:

A = J / 2

Step 3: Substitute this expression for A into the second equation to eliminate the variable J_5.

J = 2 * A
J = 2 * (J / 2)

Solving this equation for J:

J = 2 * (J / 2)
J = 2 * J / 2
J = 2 J / 4
J = J / 2
J = 2 * (J / 2)
J = 2 * (1 * J / 2)
J = 2 * 1 * J / 2
J = J / 1
J = J

This shows that the equation J = 2 * A is already in the simplified form for J, no further calculations are required.

Step 4: Solve the second equation for A.
J_5 = J - 5
A_5 (A age 5 years ago) = J_5
A_5 = J - 5

Now we have A_5 in terms of J.

Step 5: Determine Jerry's age in 3 years.
First, we need to find Jerry's age in 1 year from now.

J_1 = J + 1

Now we can find Jerry's age in 3 years, by calculating J_3:

J_3 = J_1 + 1
J_3 = (J + 1) + 1
J_3 = J + 1 + 1
J_3 = J + 2

To calculate Jerry's age in 3 years based on the given information, we need to use the expression J=2A and the fact that A_5 = J-5 to derive an expression for A_3 in terms of A.

We know J = 2 * A, and A_5 = J - 5.

Substituting the expressions for J and J_5 in terms of A into A_5 = J - 5:

2 * A = 2 * A_5
A = A_5

And A_5 = 2 * A - 5, since J = 2 * A and J_5 = J - 5.

Therefore, A_5 = 2 * A - 5, which can be rearranged to calculate A_3:

A_3 = 2 * A - 3

Now we know that J = 2 * A, and we can calculate J_3:

J_3 = J + 2
J_3 = 2 * A + 2

To calculate Jerry's age in 3 years (J_3), we can substitute the expression for A_3 in terms of A into J_3:

J_3 = 2 * (2 * A - 3) + 2
J_3 = 4 * A - 2 + 2
J_3 = 4 * A

Step 6: Show the final answer.
The final answer is:
Jerry will be 4 * A years old in 3 years.
Since A is Jerry's age now, this can be written as:
Jerry will be 4 * (his current age) years old in 3 years.</s>","We know that Jerry's Age/2 = Jerry's Age - 5
Therefore Jerry's Age = 2 Jerry's age - 10
Therefore -Jerry's Age = - 10
Therefore Jerry's Age = <<10=10>>10
In three years Jerry will be 13 because 10 + 3 = <<10+3=13>>13

                 [/INST] To find out how many hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The cost of each implant is $2000. There are 2 implants, so the cost of both is: $2000 * 2 = $4000
2. The cost of one implant with a porcelain crown is $2000 (base price) + $500 (crown feature) = $2500
3. George has already paid a deposit of $600, which needs to be deducted from the total cost.

The total cost of the dental work for George is: $4000 (for 2 implants) + $2500 (for one implant with a porcelain crown) - $600 (deposit) = $7500

Next, let's find out how many hours George needs to work to reach the final payment amount:

$7500 / $15/hour = 500 hours

{The final answer is: George needs to work for 500 hours to pay for the dental work.}</s>","The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.

                 [/INST] To find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we first need to determine the measures of the two given angles. Let's denote the smallest angle as x.

1. Given information: The sum of the three angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, angle A = x, angle B = 2x, and angle C = x + 2x = 3x.

2. The sum of the angles x, 2x, and 3x is equal to 180 degrees. So, x + 2x + 3x = 180.

3. Combine the terms to simplify the equation: 6x = 180.

4. Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to find the value of x: x = 30.

5. Now that we have the value of the smallest angle x = 30 degrees, we can find the measures of the other angles. Angle B = 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees, and angle C = x + 2x = 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

{The final answer is: The largest angle C measures 90 degrees.}

Keep in mind that this triangle with angles 30, 60, and 90 degrees is a right-angled triangle, which follows the 30-60-90 degree relationship.</s>","Let x be the measure of the smallest angle
x+2x+3x=180
6x=180
x=<<30=30>>30
Then the largest angle is 3*30=<<3*30=90>>90 degrees.

                 [/INST] To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to convert all his coins into nickels, as each gumball costs a nickel. To do this, we'll calculate the number of nickels he has in total.

1. Quarters: 8 quarters * 5 nickels = 40 nickels
2. Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 nickels = 60 nickels
3. Nickels: 14 nickels * 1 nickel = 14 nickels
4. Pennies: 15 pennies don't count towards buying gumballs, as they are not worth a nickel.

Now, let's calculate the total number of nickels Colby has:

Total nickels = Nickels from quarters + Nickels from dimes + Nickels from pocket = 40 + 60 + 14 = 114 nickels

{The final answer is 114 nickels which can be used to buy 114 gumballs.}</s>","He has $2 in quarters because 8 times .25 equals <<8*.25=2>>2.

                 [/INST] To find out how many games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he bought with his savings and the number of games he received as gifts.

First, let's find out how many games Steve bought with his savings. He saved up enough money to buy one game per month for a year and then bought twice as many games the following year. So, the number of games he bought in each year is:

Year 1: 1 game per month * 12 months = 12 games
Year 2: 1 game per month * 12 months * 2 = 24 games
Year 3: 1 game per month * 12 months * 2 * 2 = 48 games

Therefore, Steve bought a total of 12 + 24 + 48 = <<12+24+48=84>>84 games with his savings.

Next, let's calculate how many games Steve received as gifts. He received 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas every year. So, the total number of games he received as gifts is:

Gifts for the first year: 5 games (birthday) + 5 games (Christmas) = 10 games
Gifts for the second year: 10 games (birthday) + 5 games (Christmas) = 15 games
Gifts for the third year: 10 games (birthday) + 5 games (Christmas) = 15 games

Therefore, Steve received a total of 10 + 15 + 15 = <<10+15+15=40>>40 games as gifts.

Finally, to find out the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we add the number of games he bought with his savings to the number of games he received as gifts:

Total number of games = Number of games bought with savings + Number of games received as gifts
Total number of games = 84 games + 40 games = <<84+40=124>>124 games

So, {The final answer is Steve has 124 games after 3 years}.</s>","Steve buys 1 game a month his first year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*1=<<1*12=12>>12 games

Steve then buys 4 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*4=<<4*12=48>>48 games
Steve also gets 5 games for Christmas each year for three years, for another 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 games.
In total over three years, Steve gets 12+24+48+15=<<12+24+48+15=99>>99 games

Given:
1. Distance traveled: 1200 miles
2. Time taken: 3 hours

We can calculate the plane's speed using the formula: Speed = Distance / Time

Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles/hour

Now that we know the plane's speed (400 miles/hour), we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find out how long it takes to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Step 3: Marissa produces 3/4 times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour, so: 60 pounds/hour * 3/4 = 45 pounds/hour.

Step 4: To find the total amount of chocolates they make in a day (12 hours), we need to find their combined hourly production: Ruiz: 60 pounds/hour, Marissa: 45 pounds/hour. So, their combined hourly production is: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds/hour.

Step 5: To calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in a day, simply multiply their hourly production by the number of hours in a day: 105 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1260 pounds.

                 [/INST] To solve this problem, let's first find out how many rotations Jeremey's tires make in a month. We're given that every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times, and Jeremy drives 400 miles in a month.

First, we'll find out how many rotations occur during the entire 400 miles drive:

Number of rotations during 400 miles = (number of rotations per 2 miles) × (number of miles driven in one month ÷ number of miles per 2 miles)

First, let's calculate the number of miles driven per month: 400 miles.

Now, calculate the number of rotations during the entire 400 miles drive:

Number of rotations during 400 miles = 725 × (400 miles ÷ 2 miles)

Next, we'll calculate the number of rotations in a month:

Number of rotations per month = Number of rotations during 400 miles ÷ (number of miles driven in one month ÷ number of miles per 2 miles)

Number of rotations per month = 725 × 200 ÷ 1 = 145,000

Now that we know the number of rotations per month, we'll calculate how many years would pass before the tire needs to be replaced based on the total rotations it can undergo before needing replacement, which is 10,440,000 rotations.

Number of months before tire replacement = Total rotations before replacement ÷ Number of rotations per month

Number of months before tire replacement = 10,440,000 ÷ 145,000 ≈ 72.6 years

Since we cannot have a fraction of a year, we'll round this up to the next whole number:

{The final answer is: Approximately 73 years before the tire needs to be replaced}</s>","Jeremy drives 400/2=<<400/2=200>>200 segments of 2 miles
That means each month the car undergoes 200*725=<<200*725=145000>>145,000 rotations
So the tire can last for 10,440,000/145,000=<<10440000/145000=72>>72 months
That means the tires will last 72/12=<<72/12=6>>6 years

Since one washing requires 2 pumps according to the directions and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, one wash for Jackie requires 1 more pump than the amount needed for one washing according to the directions.

 step 1 answer: Jackie needs 3 pumps per wash.

Step 2: Calculate the number of washes Jackie can get out of one bottle.
We know that one bottle gives 120 washes according to the directions and each of Jackie's washes requires 3 pumps. So, we need to find out how many pumps are in total in 120 washes for Jackie.

Total number of pumps for 120 washes = Pumps per wash * Number of washes
Total number of pumps for 120 washes = 3 pumps/wash * 120 washes

 step 2 answer: The jumbo bottle contains 360 pumps.

Step 3: Determine the cost of one pump.
We know that the cost of one jumbo bottle is $24.00. So, we can find the cost of one pump by dividing the cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps in the bottle.

Cost of one pump = Cost of one bottle / Total number of pumps in the bottle
Cost of one pump = $24.00 / 360 pumps
Cost of one pump = $0.067 cents (rounded to two decimal places)

 step 3 answer: Each pump costs approximately 6.7 cents.

Assuming ; that . sales ? tax , is included, ; how much ! money will Joe ! have left : after . the purchase?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of the shirt before the sale.
$25 (cost of shirt) * 1.3 (100% + 30% sales tax) = $32.50

Step 2: Calculate the discounted cost of the shirt.
$32.50 (cost before tax) * 0.7 (100% - 30% sale) = $23.10 (approximately)

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the shorts before sales tax.
$35 (cost of shorts) * 1.3 (100% + 30% sales tax) = $46.50

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the shorts after the sale.
$46.50 (cost before tax) * 0.7 (100% - 30% sale) = $32.95 (approximately)

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the items (shirt and shorts) for Joe.
$23.10 (cost of shirt) + $32.95 (cost of shorts) = $56.05 (approximately)

Step 6: Subtract the cost of the items from the money Joe has to find out how much he has left.
$50 (money Joe has) - $56.05 (total cost) = -$16.05

Since Joe cannot have a negative amount of money, there seems to be a mistake in the original problem or the sales tax calculation. Based on the information given, Joe will not have enough money for the purchase with the given prices and sales tax amount.

{The final answer is, there is a mistake in the information provided, and Joe cannot make the purchase with his current budget.}</s>","The price of the two clothing items totals 35 + 25 = <<35+25=60>>60 dollars before discount.
The total sale discount comes to 60 * 0.3 = <<60*0.3=18>>18 dollars.
The final sale price comes to 60 - 18 = <<60-18=42>>42 dollars.
Joe ends up with 50 - 42 = <<50-42=8>>8 dollars change.

                 [/INST] To find out how much John's research ended up costing, we need to find the total amount of funding he received during the first 5 months and then find the additional funding he received each month after the first 5 months and add it to the total.

First, we know that John had initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months.

Next, we're told that every month after the first 5 took 50% more funding. So, we can calculate the funding for each month after the first 5 by multiplying the previous month's funding by 1.5 (100% + 50%).

Let's assume the funding for the first month after the first 5 is X.

Funding for second month after first 5: X * 1.5
Funding for third month after first 5: (X * 1.5) * 1.5
Funding for fourth month after first 5: ((X * 1.5) * 1.5) * 1.5
......
Funding for tenth month after first 5: ((X * 1.5) ^ 9) * 1.5

Since we know that research took 10 times longer than the first 5 months, we can find the length of each month after the first 5 by dividing the total number of months by 15 (the number of months in the first 5).

Total number of months: 5 * 15 + 10 = 25

Since there are approximately 30-31 days in a month, let's use an average of 30.4 days per month.

Now, we can find the number of days in each month after the first 5.

Number of days in first 5 months: 5 * 30.4
Number of days in first additional month: 30.4
Number of days in second additional month: 30.4 * 1.5 = 45.6 (rounding up to 46 days)
Number of days in third additional month: 46 * 1.5 = 69 (rounding up to 70 days)
....
Number of days in tenth additional month: 250 (rounding up to 251 days)

Total number of days in research: 75 * 30.4 + 10 * 251 = 16362

Now, we can find the amount of funding for each month after the first 5 and add it up to find the total cost of the research.

Funding for first month after first 5: $100,000
Funding for second month after first 5: $150,000
Funding for third month after first 5: $225,000
......
Funding for tenth month after first 5: $2,343,750

Total funding for research: $100,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + ... + $2,343,750 = $3,031, 125,000

Therefore, John's research ended up costing approximately $3,031,125.

{The final answer is $3,031,125}</s>","The research ended up taking 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 months
So he paid for expensive research for 50-5=<<50-5=45>>45 months
Each month of research at the cheaper stage cost 100,000/5=$<<100000/5=20000>>20,000
So the more expensive research cost 20,000*1.5=$<<20000*1.5=30000>>30,000
So that research cost 45*30,000=$<<45*30000=1350000>>1,350,000
So the total cost was 1,350,000+100,000=$<<1350000+100000=1450000>>1,450,000

- The third player consumed 1 pound of meat, which is equal to 16 ounces.

Step 2: Sum up the total amount of meat consumed by all players.
Total meat consumption = 6 oz (first player) + 8 oz (second player) + 16 oz (third player) = 20 oz

Posts by one member in March = Posts per day * Days in a month
= 3 posts per day * 30 days
= 90 posts in March

Step 4: Therefore, the total number of posts by all members in March is:

Then, we'll calculate the number of gallons of water he uses in a year and finally, find out the cost of water used in a year.

1. Gary does laundry twice a week, so he does:
   Loads of laundry per week = 2

2. Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used per week is:
   Gallons of water per week = Loads of laundry per week * Gallons per load
   Gallons of water per week = 2 * 20
   Gallons of water per week = 40 gallons

3. To find the amount of water Gary uses in a year, we need to find out how many gallons of water he uses in a year. We know there are 52 weeks in a year, so:
   Gallons of water per year = Gallons of water per week * Weeks per year
   Gallons of water per year = 40 gallons/week * 52 weeks
   Gallons of water per year = 2080 gallons

4. Now, let's find out how much money Gary spends on water for doing laundry per year. We know that a gallon of water costs $0.15, so:
   Cost of water per year = Gallons of water per year * Cost per gallon
   Cost of water per year = 2080 gallons * $0.15/gallon
   Cost of water per year = $312

{The final answer is: Gary spends $312 on water for doing laundry in a year}</s>","First multiply the number of times Gary does laundry per week by the number of weeks per year to find how many times he does it in a year: 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = <<2*52=104>>104 loads/year

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each one step by step:

1. Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour he works, and he works for 10 hours a day. So, he sells:
15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg/day

2. His friend Bill gives him a bull that weighs 750kg. The meat from the bull will weigh less than the total weight of the bull since a significant portion of the weight is not meat but bones and other non-edible parts. Typically, the carcass of a bull can yield around 55-65% of its live weight as edible meat. So, let's assume 60% of the 750kg bull weight will be meat.
750 kg * 0.6 = 450 kg of meat

3. Prince sells 150 kg/day of meat, so it will take him some number of days to sell the entire 450 kg.

To find the number of days, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount Prince sells every day:
450 kg / 150 kg/day = 3 days {This is an approximation, as the actual number of days may vary slightly depending on the exact percentage of the bull's weight that becomes sellable meat.}

So, it will take Prince approximately 3 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

Therefore, {The final answer is 3 days}</s>","In a day Bill sells 15 * 10 = <<15*10=150>>150kg of meat.
It will take Bill 750 / 150 = <<750/150=5>>5 days to sell all the meat from the bull.

Step 2: Find the number of seats occupied by administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, so:
seats occupied by administrators = (1/4) * total number of seats = (1/4) * 72 = 18 seats

Step 3: Find the number of seats occupied by parents. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents. First, let's find the number of seats that were not occupied by administrators:
seats not occupied by administrators = total number of seats - seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats
Now, one-third of these seats were occupied by parents:

- Jim chews one piece every 2 hours.
- School lasts for 8 hours.
- To find out how many pieces he chews at school, we divide the total school hours by the hourly rate of gum consumption.

Number of pieces at school = School hours / Hours between gum pieces

Step 4: calculating the number of gum pieces Jim gives to his sister.
- Jim gives half the remaining gum to his sister when she asks right before bed.
- Therefore, the number of pieces Jim has left will be half of the initial amount minus the pieces he chewed throughout the day.

Step 5: finding the total number of pieces Jim chews throughout the day.
= 4 (school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner)
= 6 pieces

Step 6: finding the number of pieces Jim has left after giving some to his sister.

Age in 12 years = 28 years old

Step 3: Determine Charmaine's age 4 years after her age in 12 years. We now need to find her age 4 years after she turns 28.

Age 4 years later = Age in 12 years + Years after that

Step 1: Calculate Ashley's internet connection speed in kb per hour.
Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb per second. We need to find out how many kilobytes she can download in one hour.

1 hour = 60 minutes
1 minute = 60 seconds

So,
1 hour = 60 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 3600 seconds

Ashley can download 20 kb every second, so in one hour she can download:
20 kb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72,000 kb/hour

Step 2: Convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.
Now that we have Ashley's internet connection speed in kb per hour, we can convert it to Mb per hour. We know that 1 Mb equals 1000 kb.

72,000 kb/hour / 1000 kb/Mb = 72 Mb/hour

1. Tow truck towed ten cars for the first three days. So, the number of cars towed on each of these three days is ten.
2. Tow truck towed four fewer cars on each of the remaining days. To find out how many cars were towed on each of these days, we need to find the number of cars towed on the first day when it towed ten cars and subtract four from it.
3. Let x be the number of cars towed on the first day when it towed ten cars.
4. Then, the number of cars towed on the remaining days is (x - 4).
5. Since there are 7 days in a week, and the first three days had 10 cars towed each day, we have 10 + (number of cars towed on the remaining 4 days) = 13.
6. Substituting x = 10 in the equation x - 4, we get that the tow truck towed 6 cars on each of the remaining days.
7. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in a week is 10 * 3 (for the first three days) + 6 * 4 (for the remaining days).

The final answer is: 10 * 3 + 6 * 4 = 30 + 24 = 54. The tow truck towed a total of 54 cars that week.</s>","On the first three days, towing ten cars a day, the tow truck pulled 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 cars.

Step 1: Convert Adam's height and growth rate from inches to feet:
- Adam's height: 40 inches = 40 inches / 12 inches per foot = 3.33 feet
- Adam grows 2 inches a year, so his annual growth rate is 2 inches = 2 inches / 12 inches per foot = 0.17 feet per year

Step 2: Determine how many inches Adam needs to grow to meet the minimum height requirement:
- The roller coaster has a minimum height requirement of 4 feet, which is equal to 48 inches
- Adam needs to grow this many inches: 48 inches - 3.33 feet * 12 inches per foot = 15.25 inches

Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take Adam to grow tall enough:
- Adam grows 0.17 feet per year, so he grows 0.17 * 12 inches per foot = 2.04 inches per year
- To find out how many years it takes for Adam to grow 15.25 inches, we divide the number of inches by the number of inches he grows per year: 15.25 inches / 2.04 inches per year = 7.48 years

Since Adam can't grow a fraction of a year, he will need to wait until he turns 8 years old to meet the minimum height requirement for the roller coaster.

Given that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel, we have:

X = 4/5 * $2000

Step 2: Simplify the expression for X:

X = $4000 / 5
X = $800

So, the price of the gold jewel is $800.

Step 3: The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel:

Cost of silver jewel = $800 - $400
Cost of silver jewel = $400

Step 4: To find the total price for all three jewels, add the prices of each:

2. Some of the stamps had a snowflake design, some had a truck design, and some had a rose design.
3. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
4. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, number of truck stamps = 16 + 3 = 19.
5. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, number of rose stamps = 19 - 9 = 10.
6. To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to find the sum of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps.
7. We have: Snowflake stamps = 16, Truck stamps = 19, and Rose stamps = 10.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes Tom to catch up with Bob, we first need to determine the difference in their speeds and the distance between them.

1. The difference in their speeds: Bob drives 55 mph faster than Tom, so Bob's speed is 70 mph + 55 mph = 125 mph.

2. The distance between them: Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, so that's the distance we're interested in.

3. Time to catch up: To find out how long it takes Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to divide the distance by Tom's speed.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 75 miles / 70 mph

We can simplify the division by dividing the numerator and denominator by 5 (a common factor in the numerator and denominator), so the distance is reduced by a factor of 5 and the speed is increased by a factor of 5. However, since we're looking for the actual time difference and not a ratio, we don't need to convert the final answer back to the original units.

Simplified math:

Time = 15 miles / 350 mph

Calculating the time difference in hours:

Time = 15 miles / 350 mph * 3600 seconds/hour

Time = 0.042857 hours

So the time it takes Tom to catch up with Bob is approximately 0.0429 hours, or about 2.57 minutes if we convert it back to minutes (0.0429 hours * 60 minutes/hour).

Therefore, {The final answer is Tom takes approximately 2.57 minutes to catch up with Bob}.</s>","Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour to Bob's 55 miles per hour, meaning Tom is gaining at a rate of 70 mph - 55 mph = <<70-55=15>>15 mph.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Darren caught 6 - x fish less than Naomi, who caught 17 fish. So, Darren caught (17 - 6 + x) fish.
2. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, Tommy caught (17 - 6 + x + 3) fish.

Let's solve for x:
3. We want to find the value of x such that Tommy caught a certain number of fish. Let's assume Tommy caught N fish.

Substituting N for Tommy's catch in our equation, we have:

(17 - 6 + x + 3) = N
13 + x + 3 = N
x = N - 16

Now we have an expression for x in terms of N. Substituting this expression into the equation for Tommy's catch, we have:

(17 - 6 + (N - 16) + 3) = N
13 + N - 16 + 3 = N
13 + N - 13 = N - 3
N = 3

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the cost per class.
Given that Manny paid $60 for 10 classes, we can find out the cost per class by dividing the total cost by the number of classes.

Cost per class = Total cost / Number of classes
Cost per class = $60 / 10
Cost per class = $6

Step 2: Determine how many classes he can miss while staying within $10 per class.
Manny's parents have stated that they won't sign him up again if the classes end up costing more than $10 per class. To find out how many classes he can miss while still keeping the cost below $60, we need to calculate the number of classes he can attend for $60. Then, we can subtract that number from the total number of classes to find out how many he can miss.

Attendable classes = Total cost / Cost per class
Attendable classes = $60 / $6
Attendable classes = 10

So, Manny can attend 10 classes with the money he has. When subtracting the number of classes he can attend from the total number of classes, we find out that he can miss as many as 0 classes without violating his parents' condition.

Step 3: Combine the results.
The final answer is: Manny can miss 0 classes.

Explanation: Manny can attend all 10 classes with the money he has. Therefore, he doesn't need to miss any classes to abide by his parents' conditions.</s>","He must attend at least six classes, because 60 / 6 = <<60/6=10>>10

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many customers Julie processes per day. We know she processes exactly twice as many customers as Jewel, who processes 50 customers per day. So, Julie processes 50 * 2 = 100 customers per day.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of customers processed by each person in a week. since there are 7 days in a week:
Jewel: 50 customers/day * 7 days = 350 customers/week
Julie: 100 customers/day * 7 days = 700 customers/week

Step 3: The total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel is the sum of their individual weekly productions.
The total weekly production = Jewel's weekly production + Julie's weekly production = 350 customers + 700 customers = 1050 customers.

{The final answer is: The total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers.}</s>","While Jewel is processing 50 orders in a day, Julie processes 50 orders/day * 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 orders/day.

                 [/INST] To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to use the given information to set up and solve an equation. Let's follow these steps:

1. Let x represent the number of laps Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 miles per lap, then the total number of miles Reggie ran is 5x.

2. From the problem, we know that the total number of miles Paisley ran is 4 miles less than Lynn ran, and Reggie ran 3 miles more than Lynn. So, we can set up the following equation:
   Lynn = Paisley + Reggie

3. Substitute 5x for Reggie's miles in the equation:
   Lynn = Paisley + 5x

4. We know that Paisley ran 4 miles, so we can replace ""Paisley"" with 4 in the equation:
   Lynn = 4 + 5x

5. To find the number of miles Lynn ran, we need to isolate Lynn on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides:
   Lynn - 4 = 5x

6. Now, we can solve for x (the number of laps Reggie ran) by dividing both sides by 5:
   (Lynn - 4) / 5 = x

7. To find the number of miles Lynn ran, we just need to substitute this expression for x back into the original equation:
   Lynn = 4 + 5(Lynn - 4) / 5

8. Simplify the equation:
   Lynn = 4 + Lynn - 4
   Lynn = Lynn + 0
   Lynn = Lynn

9. Notice that the left side of the equation is equal to itself. This means that the equation is true for any value of Lynn. However, since the problem requires a concrete answer, we must assume that the difference between Lynn's and Paisley's miles is significant. Therefore, Lynn must have run more miles than Paisley.

10. Since we have the relationship Lynn = 4 + 5x, where x represents Reggie's number of laps, we can find the number of miles Lynn ran by increasing the value of x and calculating the corresponding Lynn value until we find a significant difference in miles. For instance, if we assume that Reggie ran 10 laps (x = 10), we get:
      Lynn = 4 + 5(10)
      Lynn = 4 + 50
      Lynn = 54

      Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Lynn ran 54 miles, the difference is 50 miles. This difference is significant, and so we have our answer.

{The final answer is: Lynn ran 54 miles.}</s>","Paisley ran <<4=4>>4 miles.
Reggie ran 5 * 4 miles = <<5*4=20>>20 miles

                 [/INST] To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges for Clyde, we first need to find the price of one apple and one orange.

Step 1: Price of one apple = Cost of 4 apples ÷ Number of apples
Price of one apple = $5.20 ÷ 4
{Price of one apple = $1.30}

Step 2: Price of one orange = Cost of 3 oranges ÷ Number of oranges
Price of one orange = $3.30 ÷ 3

Step 3: Cost of 5 apples = Price of one apple × Number of apples
Cost of 5 apples = $1.30 × 5

Step 4: Cost of 5 oranges = Price of one orange × Number of oranges
Cost of 5 oranges = $1.10 × 5
{Cost of 5 oranges = $5.50}

Step 5: Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges = Cost of 5 apples + Cost of 5 oranges

1. The volume of the hole is given as 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. We can calculate the volume using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: length × width × depth.

Volume of the hole = 6 ft × 4 ft × 3 ft
                             = 6 × 4 × 3
                             = 144 cubic ft

2. Now we know that the volume of the hole is 144 cubic feet, and it takes Bob 3 seconds to remove one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, we need to find out how long it takes him to dig the entire hole.

Time to dig the hole = Volume of the hole × Time to dig one cubic foot of earth
                                 = 144 cubic ft × 3 sec/cubic ft

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the king cab upgrade.
The king cab is an extra $7,500.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the leather seats.
The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade. So, let's find one-third of $7,500:
One-third of $7,500 = $7,500 ÷ 3 = $2,500
Therefore, the cost of the leather seats is $2,500.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the towing package.
We don't have information about the cost of the towing package in the question.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of running boards.
The cost of running boards is $500 less than the cost of leather seats. So, the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

1. Tim's monthly salary is $20000.
2. He gets a 5% raise on his salary. So his new monthly salary will be:
   New monthly salary = Old monthly salary + (Old monthly salary * Percentage increase)
   New monthly salary = $20000 + ($20000 * 0.05)
   New monthly salary = $20000 + $1000
   New monthly salary = $21000
3. He also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary. So his annual bonus will be:
   Annual bonus = New monthly salary * Bonus percentage

   Annual bonus = $10500
4. To find his total annual income, we add his new monthly salary to his annual bonus:
   Total annual income = New monthly salary * 12 months + Annual bonus
   Total annual income = $21000 * 12 + $10500
   Total annual income = $252000 + $10500
   Total annual income = $262500

{The final answer is: Tim will make $262500 in a year.}</s>","The promotion increased his monthly salary by 20000*.05=$<<20000*0.05=1000>>1000

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the cost of suits and dress pants.
- The cost of each suit is $750.
- James bought 10 suits, so the cost of suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.
- Each dress pant costs 1/5th the cost of a suit. Since a suit costs $750, each dress pant costs 1/5 * $750 = $150.
- James bought 10 dress pants, so the cost of dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of dress shirts.
- The cost of each dress shirt is $60.
- James bought 3 dress shirts, so the cost of dress shirts is 3 * $60 = $180.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
- The cost of suits and dress pants is $7500 + $1500 = $9000.
- The cost of dress shirts is $180.
- The total cost of everything James bought is $9000 + $180 = $9018.

{The final answer is $9018.}</s>","The suits cost 750*10=$<<750*10=7500>>7500
The dress pants cost 750/5=$<<750/5=150>>150 each

He bought 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 dress shirts
so he spends 30*60=$<<30*60=1800>>1800 on dress shirts
Thus the total cost is 7500+1500+1800=$<<7500+1500+1800=10800>>10,800

For the political and weather news website:
Average number of articles published daily = 20

For the business news website:
Average number of articles published daily = 10

Total number of articles published by both websites daily = Political and weather news + Business news
= 20 + 10
= 30 articles

Now, we need to find out how many articles are published by both websites in February, which has 28 days.

Total number of articles published in February = Daily total * Number of days

From the problem we know that:
1. Steve is 60 years old, so S = 60.
2. Steve's wife is 4 years older than him, so W = S + 4.
3. Their son is half the age of Steve, so C = 0.5 * S.
4. Their daughter-in-law is 3 years younger than her husband, so X = C - 3.

Substitute the given values into the equation for W and solve for C:
C = 0.5 * S
C = 0.5 * 60
C = 30

Since we have found the age of Steve's son, now we can calculate the age of his daughter-in-law:

Step 1: Find the number of 2-kilogram portions in one bag.
We know that one bag is divided into 8 portions, each of 2 kilograms. So, the number of 2-kilogram portions in one bag is:

Number of portions = Total weight of flour in the bag / Weight of each portion
Number of portions = 8 * 2
Number of portions = 16

Step 2: Find the total weight of flour in three bags before they were divided into portions.
We want to find the total weight of flour in three bags, so:

Total weight of flour in 3 bags = Number of bags * Weight of one bag
Total weight of flour in 3 bags = 3 * Weight of one bag

Step 3: Find the weight of one bag.
Let's denote the weight of one bag as x. Then, from Step 1, we know that the weight of one bag is equal to the weight of 16 portions of 2 kg each. So:

Weight of one bag = 16 * 2
Weight of one bag = 32 kg

So, the total weight of flour in three bags before they were divided into portions is:

Total weight of flour in 3 bags = 3 * Weight of one bag
Total weight of flour in 3 bags = 3 * 32
Total weight of flour in 3 bags = 96 kg

{The final answer is: 96 kilograms}</s>","A bag of flour has 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 kilograms.

First, let's find out how many miles Alisa biked:
 distance covered by Alisa = speed * time
 distance covered by Alisa = 12 miles per hour * 4.5 hours
 distance covered by Alisa = 54 miles

Next, let's find out how many miles Stanley biked:
 distance covered by Stanley = speed * time
 distance covered by Stanley = 10 miles per hour * 2.5 hours
 distance covered by Stanley = 25 miles

Now, we can find the total distance covered by both Alisa and Stanley:
 total distance covered = distance covered by Alisa + distance covered by Stanley
 total distance covered = 54 miles + 25 miles
 total distance covered = 79 miles

{The final answer is: 79 miles}</s>","Alisa = 12 * 4.5 = <<12*4.5=54>>54 miles

- Bill can dig 8 feet per hour through soil.
- Bill can dig half that speed through clay, which is 4 feet per hour.

Step 2: Calculate the total volume of soil and clay that Bill needs to dig through.
- There are 24 feet of soil to dig through.
- There are 8 feet of clay to dig through.

Step 3: Calculate the total digging time for the soil.
- Time taken to dig through soil = Volume of soil to be dug * Digging rate in soil
- = 24 feet * 8 feet/hour
- = 192 feet/hour

Step 4: Calculate the total digging time for the clay.
- Time taken to dig through clay = Volume of clay to be dug * Digging rate in clay
- = 8 feet * 4 feet/hour

                 [/INST] Step 1: We need to find out how many cupcakes Howie needs to buy for himself, his teacher, and each classmate. Since he gets 2 cupcakes for each person, we can calculate this as follows:

- Howie gets 2 cupcakes for himself, so he needs none for himself.
- He gets 2 cupcakes for the teacher, so he needs to buy 2 for the teacher.
- Each classmate gets 2 cupcakes, so he needs to buy 2 cupcakes for each classmate.

Step 2: Since there are 25 classmates, Howie needs to buy cupcakes for all of them:

Number of cupcakes for classmates = Number of classmates * Number of cupcakes per classmate
= 25 * 2
= 50

Step 3: So far, we have calculated the number of cupcakes for the teacher and all the classmates. Howie also needs to buy his own cupcakes:

Total number of cupcakes = Number of cupcakes for himself + Number of cupcakes for the teacher + Number of cupcakes for classmates
= 0 + 2 + 50
= 52

However, since Howie buys one of each type of cupcake for everyone, including himself, he will end up with an extra cupcake that he didn't intend to buy. To find the actual number of cupcakes he needs to buy, we should subtract one from the total:

The final answer is: {Howie should buy 51 cupcakes}</s>","Howie wants to get cupcakes for his 25 classmates + his 1 teacher + 1 himself = <<25+1+1=27>>27 people.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. So, the cost of pomegranates on Tuesday was 20 (pomegranates) x $20 (price per pomegranate) = $400.

Step 2: Find the discount Clara got on Tuesday.
She got $2 off, so her total cost after discount was $400 - $2 = $398.

Step 3: Find the cost of pomegranates Sheila bought on Wednesday.
She bought 20 pomegranates when the price had shot up to $30 per fruit, and she took advantage of a 10% discount. So, her cost before discount was 20 (pomegranates) x $30 (price per pomegranate) = $600. Then, with a 10% discount, the final cost she paid was $600 - (10% of $600) = $540.

Step 4: Find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days.
Price difference = Clara's final cost ($398) - Sheila's final cost ($540).

The final answer is: Sheila paid $142 ($540 - $398) more for the pomegranates than Clara did.</s>","On Tuesday, the pomegranates cost Clara 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranates = $<<20*20=400>>400

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the sales volume of red hats in the first month as `R_1`, and the sales volume of green hats in the first month as `G_1`. We know that the sales volume of red hats is $400. So, we have:

R_1 = $400

Step 2: The problem states that the sales volume of green hats is half the total sales of red and green hats in the first month. Mathematically, we can represent this as:

G_1 = 1/2 * (R_1 + T), where T is the total sales in the first month

Step 3: From the problem statement, we know that the total sales in the first month is the sum of the sales volumes of red and green hats:

T = R_1 + G_1

Substitute `R_1 = $400` from Step 1 and solve for `G_1`:

G_1 = 1/2 * ($400 + G_1)

Doubling both sides to eliminate the fraction:

2 * G_1 = $400 + G_1

Subtracting G_1 from both sides:

G_1 = $200

Step 4: The problem states that in the second month, sales were 3/4 of the total sales in the first month. Mathematically, we can represent this as:

T_2 = 3/4 * T

Substitute `T = $800` (from the previous calculation), and calculate `T_2`:

T_2 = 3/4 * $800

T_2 = $600

Step 5: Since the sales volumes of red and green hats in the second month are 3/4 of their respective sales volumes in the first month, we can represent the sales volumes as:

R_2 = 3/4 * R_1 = 3/4 * $400 = $300

G_2 = 3/4 * G_1 = 3/4 * $200 = $150

Step 6: Calculate the total sales in the second month:

T_2 = R_2 + G_2

T_2 = $300 + $150

T_2 = $450

Step 7: Therefore, the total sales in two months are:

Total sales = T_1 + T_2

Total sales = $800 + $450

Total sales = $1250

{The final answer is: The total sales in two months were $1250}</s>","Since the total sales of red hats were half that of green hats in the first month, she made 2*$400=$<<2*400=800>>800 from green hats.

                 [/INST] steps:

1. First, let's determine how many hours James actually paid for. The hiring is from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only paid for 3 hours.
2. The cost for the first hour is $15. The cost for each hour after that is twice the cost of the first hour. So, the cost for the second hour is 2 * $15 = $30. The cost for the third hour is 2 * $15 = $30 as well.
3. To calculate the total cost, we simply add up the cost for each hour James paid for: $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

{The final answer is: $75.}</s>","He got it for 9-5=<<9-5=4>>4 hours

- The start of the week: $200
- The current amount in her account: $420

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Sally received this week besides her wage.
- The current amount in her account ($420) minus the amount at the start of the week ($200): $420 - $200 = $220

Step 3: Find out the difference between the amount Sally should have received as wage and the amount she actually has.

Eggs needed = Servings per guest * Number of guests
Eggs needed = 3 deviled egg halves * 16 guests
Eggs needed = 48 deviled egg halves

Step 3: We know that 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves. So, to make 48 egg halves, Lori will need:
Eggs needed = Halves * Number of eggs
Eggs needed = 48 egg halves * 1 whole egg / 2 egg halves
Eggs needed = 24 eggs

* The book is 200 pages long.
* Mike is required to read the entire book for an assignment.
* The assignment is due within 30 days.
* Mike plans to read 10 pages per day.

To find out how many days before the deadline Mike will have finished reading the book, we first need to determine how many days it will take him to read the book in full based on his reading plan.

1. First, calculate how many pages Mike will read in total according to his plan: 10 pages/day * Number of days.

2. Next, determine the number of days it will take Mike to finish the book: Number of days = Total pages / Pages read per day.

3. Subtract this number from the total number of days Mike has to complete the assignment to find out how many days before the deadline he will finish.

Let's calculate:

1. Total pages Mike will read: 10 pages/day * Number of days.
                                   = 10 pages/day * 30 days
                                   = 300 pages

2. Number of days it will take Mike to finish the book: Number of days = Total pages / Pages read per day.
                                                                           = 200 pages / 10 pages/day

3. Days before deadline Mike will finish: 30 days (total assignment duration) - 20 days (time it takes Mike to finish the book)
                                                        = 10 days

The cost of renting the hanger is $5000 per month, so that's $5000 × 12 = $60,000 per year.

The cost of fuel is twice the amount spent on rent, so that's $5000 × 12 × 2 = $120,000 per year.

Therefore, the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year is C + annual rental + annual fuel = $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

1. Finley went to the grocery store and bought rice, beans, and pork for her home.
2. It took her 20 minutes more to cook pork than rice.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
4. It took her 30 minutes to cook rice.

First, let's find out how long it took Finley to cook pork. Since it took her 20 minutes more to cook pork than rice, and rice took 30 minutes to cook, pork took 30 + 20 = <<30+20=50>>50 minutes to cook.

Next, let's find out how long it took to cook beans. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so beans took (0.5) * (30 + 50) = <<0.5*(30+50)=75>>75 minutes to cook.

Finally, to find the total time it took Finley to cook all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans: 30 minutes for rice + 50 minutes for pork + 75 minutes for beans = <<30+50+75=155>>155 minutes.

Given that a pound of almonds costs $10 and a pound of walnuts costs $15:

1. Calculate the cost of 1/2 pound of almonds: C_A = (1/2) * $10 = $5
2. Calculate the cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts: C_W = (1/3) * $15 = $5 (approximately)
3. Calculate the cost of 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts: C = C_A + C_W = $5 + $5 = $10

Now let's find the cost of 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts.

1. Calculate the cost of 1/5 pound of almonds: C_Almonds_5 = (1/5) * $10 = $2
2. Calculate the cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts: C_Walnuts_3 = (1/3) * $15 = $5
3. Calculate the cost of 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts: C = C_Almonds_5 + C_Walnuts_3 = $2 + $5 = $7

Now to find the difference in cost, subtract the cost of the first mixture from the cost of the second mixture:

Difference in Cost = C_56Percentury - C = $10 - $7 = $3

{The final answer is: The cost of 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts is $3 more than the cost of 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts.}</s>","One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
One-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.
A one-third pound of walnuts costs $15/3 = $<<15/3=5>>5.
So, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $5 + $5 = $10.
And 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $2 + $5 = $7.
Therefore, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $10 - $7 = $3 more than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. We are given two equations based on the information in the problem:

1. The total number of animal legs is 70. In other words, S sheep have 4 legs each, and G geese have 2 legs each, so: S * 4 + G * 2 = 70
2. The total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head as well, we have: S + G = 20

We have two equations with two unknowns. To solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination method. Here, we will use the elimination method. First, let's solve the second equation for one of the variables:

S = 20 - G

Now, substitute this expression for S into the first equation:

4 * (20 - G) + 2 * G = 70

Multiplying this equation out:

80 - 4 * G + 2 * G = 70

Combining the terms with G:

6 * G = 10

Dividing both sides by 6 to find the value of G:

G = 10 / 6 ≈ 1.67

Since the number of geese cannot be a fraction, there's an error in the problem. However, if we round up to the nearest whole number, we get:

G = 2

Now, we can find the value of S using the expression we derived earlier:

S = 20 - G

S = 20 - 2

S = 18

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 18.

The final answer is: 18 sheep.</s>","Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.
Therefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.
The animals have 2g + 4s = 70 legs.
Using the value of s above, 2g + 4(20-g) = 70.
2g + 80 - 4g = 70.
2g = 10.
There are therefore 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 geese.
There are 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 sheep remaining on the farm.

Step 1: Find the cost of the normal brand of coffee that Roger bought.
- Roger bought the normal brand of coffee, which costs $5 per pound.
- Let's assume Roger bought 'x' pounds of coffee. Then the cost of the normal brand coffee is 5x dollars.

Step 2: Find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee that Roger bought.
- Since this brand costs 20% more than the normal brand, its cost per pound is 1.20 * $5 = $6.
- Roger bought 'y' pounds of the more expensive brand of coffee. Then the cost of the more expensive brand coffee is 6y dollars.

Step 3: Find the total cost of coffee and donut.
- The cost of coffee is the sum of the cost of normal brand coffee and the cost of more expensive brand coffee. So, 5x + 6y.
- Roger also bought a donut that costs $2.
- The total cost of coffee and donut is 5x + 6y + 2.

Step 4: Determine how many days' worth of coffee Roger bought.
- Rogers uses 1 pound of coffee per day, so he bought enough coffee for 'z' days.
- We know that x pounds of coffee can make z days, so x = z.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of Rogers purchase.
- Since x = z, the total cost of coffee and donut is 5z + 6y + 2.

So, the final answer is 5z + 6y + 2, where z is the number of days' worth of coffee Roger bought and y is the number of pounds of the more expensive brand of coffee he bought.</s>","The coffee he bought was 5*.2=$<<5*.2=1>>1 more expensive per pound than what he normally buys

Total spent = $4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Step 2: Find the cost of the apple pie
The total amount Gus spent was $13.00, but we don't know the cost of the apple pie. To find out, we need to subtract the known costs from the total amount:
$13.00 (total) - $4.00 (chips) - $8.00 (chicken) - $1.00 (soda) = $0.00 (oops, we spent more than we bought...)

This appears to be a mistake in the problem statement. If each piece of information is meant to be correct, then it's not possible for Gus to have spent $13.00 on the items mentioned and also bought an apple pie.

However, let's assume that there was a typo or omission in the problem, and the cost of the apple pie was also given, but we missed it. In that case, we'd need another piece of information to solve the problem.

The final answer is: We cannot determine the cost of the apple pie with the given information.</s>","He bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each so they cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00
He spent $4.00 on chips, $8.00 on fried chicken and $1.00 on soda so he spent 4+8+1 = $<<4+8+1=13.00>>13.00
He spent $20.00 and all of the groceries, except for the pie cost $13.00 so that means the apple pie cost 20-13 = $<<20-13=7.00>>7.00

2. Next, let's identify the number of newspapers James delivers to District C: He delivers 209 newspapers to District C.
3. Therefore, the number of newspapers James delivers to District B is the difference between the total number of newspapers James delivers in a day and the number of newspapers he delivers to Districts A and C.

Total number of newspapers James delivers = 600

1. We know that Kassidy has 3/4 the amount of money Aurelia has. So, we first need to find out how much money Kassidy has.

Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 the amount of money Aurelia has:

Money_Kassidy = 3/4 * Money_Aurelia
Money_Kassidy = 3/4 * $120
Money_Kassidy = $96

2. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy:

Money_Rayna = Money_Kassidy + $60
Money_Rayna = $96 + $60
Money_Rayna = $156

3. To find out how much each of them would get if they shared the money equally, we can simply divide the total amount by the number of people:

Total_Money = Money_Aurelia + Money_Rayna = $120 + $156 = $276
Shared_Money = Total_Money / Number_of_People

Shared_Money = $276 / 3 = $91.67 per person (approximately)

{The final answer is that Rayna has $156 more than Kassidy, and they would each get approximately $91.67 if they shared the money equally.}</s>","Since Arelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money Arelia, Kassidy has 3/4*$120 = $<<3/4*120=90>>90

Adam bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B. Therefore, the total cost of candies is:

Total cost = Cost of candies of type A * Number of candies of type A + Cost of candies of type B * Number of candies of type B

Cost of one candy of type A = $0.5
Cost of one candy of type B = $0.75

Total cost = $0.5 * 7 (candies of type A) + $0.75 * 10 (candies of type B)

Total cost = $3.5 + $7.5

Total cost = $11

Step 2: Calculate the change Adam received.

Adam paid the cashier $15. The difference between the amount paid and the cost of candies is the change he received.

Change = Amount paid - Total cost

Change = $15 - $11

Change = $4

1. Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has.
2. Janey has 21 books.

Let's denote the number of books Sally has as x.

According to the problem statement, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. Mathematically, this can be written as:

x + 3 = 2(x)

Now, let's solve for x:
1. Subtract x from both sides: x = 2x - 3
2. Solve for x: x = 3 (this is not a valid solution as x cannot be a number of books)
3. Instead, we can divide both sides by 1 (this is a valid solution): x = 2 - 0.5 = 1.5. Since the number of books cannot be a fraction, we need to find an integer value close to 1.5 that fulfills the condition.

Step 3: Find out how many inches the bamboo will grow in the remaining height to reach 600 inches.
600 inches (desired height) - 240 inches (current height) = 360 inches

Step 4: Divide the remaining height to reach in inches by the number of inches that grows in a day.
360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days

So, {The final answer is: it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to a height of 600 inches.}</s>","Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that James currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so each dog will need one toy, making the total number of toys needed 12 (4 toys for current dogs + 8 toys for new dogs).
3. James bought additional toys to accommodate the new dogs.
4. When he came back a second time, there were twice as many dogs as before. So, the number of new dogs was 8 (twice the number of dogs when James left). Therefore, he needed to buy 8 more toys for those dogs.
5. Altogether, James needed to buy 12 toys for the current dogs and 8 toys for the new dogs.
6. However, when he came back a third time, he found that 3 dogs were gone. Therefore, he no longer needed the 3 toys he bought for those dogs.
7. Thus, the total number of toys James needs is 12 + 8 - 3 = {17 toys}.

So, the final answer is: {The final answer is 17 toys.}</s>","James has 4+8=<<4+8=12>>12 toys.
There were 12*2=<<12*2=24>>24 dogs.
James needed to buy 24-12=<<24-12=12>>12 more toys.
There are 36 total toys.
36-3=<<36-3=33>>33 toys are now needed.

                 [/INST] To determine how many signatures the sisters need to collect in the remaining three weeks to reach a total of 100 signatures between them, we first need to find out how many signatures each sister needs to collect individually.

Since they want to have a total of 100 signatures between them, and Carol currently has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures, we can find out how many signatures each sister needs to collect in the remaining three weeks by subtracting their current number of signatures from their goal and then distributing that difference evenly between them.

First, we need to find the total number of signatures they need to have between them by the end of the summer.

Total signatures needed = 100 signatures

Next, we need to find out how many signatures each sister needs to collect in the remaining three weeks to reach their goal.

Signatures needed for both sisters = 100 signatures
Signatures Carol currently has = 20 signatures
Signatures Jennifer currently has = 44 signatures

To find out how many signatures each sister needs to collect in the remaining three weeks, we need to find the difference between the total number of signatures they need and the total number of signatures they currently have and then divide that difference by 2 to find the number of signatures each sister needs to collect.

Signatures needed for both sisters = 100 signatures
Signatures Carol currently has = 20 signatures
Signatures Jennifer currently has = 44 signatures

Total signatures needed for both = Signatures needed for both sisters + Signatures Carol currently has + Signatures Jennifer currently has
Total signatures needed = 100 + 20 + 44 = 124 signatures

Signatures each sister needs to collect in the remaining three weeks = (Total signatures needed - Signatures Carol currently has - Signatures Jennifer currently has) / 2
Signatures each sister needs to collect = (124 - 20 - 44) / 2
Signatures each sister needs to collect = 18.5

Since it's not possible for each sister to collect a half signature, they need to collect at least 19 signatures each in the remaining three weeks to reach their goal of having a total of 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer.

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 19 signatures each, for a total of 38 signatures in the remaining three weeks to reach their goal.

{The final answer is: The sisters need to collect a total of 38 signatures in the remaining three weeks to reach their goal of having 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer.}</s>","Carol and Jennifer have already collected 20 + 44 signatures = <<20+44=64>>64 signatures.
Since their goal is 100, they need to collect 100 - 64 signatures. 100 - 64 = <<100-64=36>>36 signatures

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find Karen's hourly wage.
Karen earns twice what Lorie earns hourly, so:
Karen's hourly wage = 2 * Lorie's hourly wage = 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Step 2: Find Karen's hourly earnings in one day.
Karen works 3 hours per day, so her daily earnings are:
Karen's daily earnings = Karen's hourly wage * hours worked per day = $20 * 3 = $60.

Step 3: Find Karen's earnings in two days.
To find Karen's earnings in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by the number of days:
Karen's earnings in two days = Karen's daily earnings * number of days = $60 * 2 = $120.

{The final answer is: Karen earns $120 in two days.}</s>","Karen earns $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20 per hour.

                 [/INST] To solve this problem, we first need to understand the concept of factorials and how many hash browns we get from one potato.

1. We know that 6! (6 factorial) potatoes make 36 hash browns. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. In this case, 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720. Therefore, one potato makes 720/6 = 120 hash browns.
2. To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we simply multiply the number of hash browns made from one potato by the number of potatoes: 120 hash browns/potato × 96 potatoes = {5,728 hash browns}.

So, the final answer is 5,728 hash browns.</s>","First find the number of hash browns per potato: 36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = <<36/6=6>>6 hash browns/potato

- Jack's weight is 80 kg.
- Each of the other adults weighs 80 kg as well.
- So, there are 9 people in total, and their combined weight is:

Step 2: Calculate the total weight of Jack and the other adults.
Total weight = Jack's weight + (Number of other adults * Weight of one adult)
Total weight = 80 kg + (8 * 80 kg)
Total weight = 80 kg + 640 kg
Total weight = 720 kg

Step 3: Compare the total weight to the maximum load of the elevator.

Step 4: Determine if they have exceeded the maximum load.
The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg. The total weight of Jack and the other adults is 720 kg, which is greater than the maximum load.

Step 5: Calculate the excess weight.
Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

                 [/INST] Let's denote the ages of the two twins as A and B, and the ages of all three triplets as C, D, and E. We know that one twin (A) is 7 years older than one triplet (C). Also, the combined ages of two twins and three triplets is 44.

Now we have two equations:

1. A = C +7
2. A + B + C + D + E = 44

We can substitute C in equation 2 with A-7 to make use of the information given in equation 1:

A + B + (A-7) + D + E = 44

Simplifying this equation:

A + B + A - 7 + D + E = 44
2A + (B-7) + D + E = 41

We currently have three variables (A, B, and D+E) for only two known values (A+B and A). To solve for A, we would need an additional equation or constraint. One possible solution could be to make assumptions about the variables B and D+E or make an assumption about the relationship between the variables.

For example, if we assume that one triplet's age is always less than one twin's age, then D would be less than B-7. However, without a clear restriction on the variables or additional information, there isn't enough data to determine the exact age of one of the twins.

{The final answer is: There isn't enough information to determine the exact age of one of the twins from the given data.}</s>","Let T = age of triplet
Twin's age = T + <<+7=7>>7
Twin's combined age = 2 * (T + 7)
Triplet's combined age = <<3=3>>3T
2 * (T + 7) + 3T = 44
2T + 14 + 3T = 44
5T + 14 = 44
5T = 30
T = <<6=6>>6
Twin = 6 + 7 = <<6+7=13>>13
The twins are each <<13=13>>13 years old.

1. John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. Therefore, the total time he spends on his homework is:
2. 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

3. John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Let's convert this time to minutes:
4. 3 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

5. Now we need to find out how many minutes are left for John to nap. To do that, subtract the time John spent on his homework from the time he has before dinner:
6. 180 minutes (time before dinner) - 80 minutes (time spent on homework) = 100 minutes

7. {The final answer is: John has 100 minutes to take a nap.}</s>","John has to spend 20+40+20 = <<20+40+20=80>>80 minutes on homework.
John has 3 hours*60 minutes= <<3*60=180>>180 minutes before dinner.
Thus, John has 180-80=<<180-80=100>>100 minutes for his nap.

1. Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies that cost $3.20.
2. Each lollipop costs $0.40.
3. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.
4. The given total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20, and the cost of 5 lollipops is $2.00. So, the cost of 4 candies is $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.
5. Since 1 candy costs the same as each lollipop, the cost of 1 candy is $0.40.
6. Therefore, the cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.
7. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.
8. The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 (for lollipops) + $4.00 (for candies) = $8.00.

{The final answer is: $8.00}.</s>","Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.
So four candies cost $3.20 - $2 = $1.20.
Thus, each candy costs $1.20/4 = $<<1.20/4=0.30>>0.30.
Ten lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.
Ten candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.
Hence, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4 + $3 = $7.

                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many coins Rong saves every month: Rong saves 20 coins every month.

Next, we need to find out how many coins Neil saves every month. We know that Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong every month. So, the number of coins Neil saves every month is 20 * (2/5 + 1).

Let's calculate this: 20 * (2/5 + 1) = 20 * (7/5) = 20 * 1.4 = 28 coins.

Now we want to find out how many coins they each have after saving for 10 years. Since they both save monthly, we'll find out how many coins they have in a year and then multiply that by 10.

Let's find out how many coins Rong has after 1 year: Rong saves 20 coins every month, so he saves 20 coins every month * 12 months = 240 coins every year.

Now let's find out how many coins Neil has after 1 year: Neil saves 28 coins every month, so he saves 28 coins every month * 12 months = 336 coins every year.

Finally, to find out how many coins they both have after 10 years, we multiply the number of coins they save in a year by 10:

Rong's savings after 10 years = 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins
Neil's savings after 10 years = 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins

{The final answer is: Rong has 2400 coins and Neil has 3360 coins after saving for 10 years}.</s>","Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong, a total of 2/5*20 = <<2/5*20=8>>8 more coins.
The total number of coins that Neil has been saving in his piggy month per month is 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 coins.
If Rong has been saving 20 coins every month for ten years, the total number of months he's been saving for is 12*10 = <<12*10=120>>120 months.
Saving 20 coins every month for ten years, Rong has 20*120 = <<20*120=2400>>2400 coins in his piggy bank.
If Neil has also been saving for ten years, he has saved 120*28 = <<120*28=3360>>3360 coins in his piggy bank.

                 [/INST] To find out how much John leaves with after paying for his dog's vet bill, we need to first calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.

The cost of one vaccine is $20. Since his dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost of vaccines is:

Cost of vaccines = Number of vaccines * Cost per vaccine
Cost of vaccines = 2 * $20
Cost of vaccines = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's assume the total bill (without the heartworm check) is x. Then the cost of the heartworm check is:

Cost of heartworm check = 0.6 * x

The total bill (including the cost of vaccines and the heartworm check) is:

Total bill = Cost of vaccines + Cost of heartworm check

We know that John brought $125 with him. We want to find out how much he leaves with:

Total bill = $125 - x

Substitute the expressions we found for the cost of vaccines and the heartworm check into the equation for the total bill:

$125 - x = $40 + 0.6x

Subtract 0.4x from both sides of the equation:

$125 = 1.4x

Divide both sides by 1.4:

x = $96.43

The total bill is $96.43. Since John brought $125 with him, he leaves with:

$125 - $96.43 = $28.57

Therefore, the final answer is: John leaves with $28.57.</s>","The vaccines cost 40 because 2 x 20 = <<2*20=40>>40
The vaccines are 40% of his total bill because 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40

He leaves with $25 because 125 - 100 = <<125-100=25>>25

- 5 bananas
- 12 apples
- 7 oranges

Step 2: Calculate the cost of bananas, apples, and oranges separately.

Cost of bananas = Number of bananas * Price per banana
= 5 * 2 * $0.5
= $5

Cost of apples = Number of apples * Price per apple
= 12 * $0.5
= $6

Step 3: Calculate the cost of oranges.

Cost of oranges = Number of oranges * Price per orange
= 7 * 3 * $0.5
= $10.5

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of a crate.

Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges

One orange is three times more expensive than a banana, so it costs 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.
So for the oranges in the crate, one needs to pay 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.
So the whole crate costs 6 + 5 + 21 = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.

The comforter has 14 red squares, 18 red squares more than the number of blue squares, and 6 blue squares more than the number of green squares. Additionally, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.

Let's find the number of red, blue, and green squares:
1. The comforter has 14 red squares.
2. There are 18 more red squares than blue squares: Red squares = 14 + 18 = 32. To find the number of blue squares, we subtract the difference between red and blue squares from the number of red squares: Blue squares = Red squares - (Red squares - Blue squares) = 14 + 18 - 12 = 22.
3. There are 6 more blue squares than green squares: Green squares = Blue squares + 6 = 22 + 6 = 28.
4. There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares: White squares = Green squares - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16.

Now, we can calculate the total number of square feet by finding the area of each color and summing them up:
1 square foot = 1 foot × 1 foot = 1 square foot

Total square feet = (Number of red squares × 1 square foot) + (Number of blue squares × 1 square foot) + (Number of green squares × 1 square foot) + (Number of white squares × 1 square foot)

Total square feet = (32 × 1) + (22 × 1) + (28 × 1) + (16 × 1) = 32 + 22 + 28 + 16 = 92 square feet.

{The final answer is 92 square feet.}</s>","With 4 more blue than red squares, the comforter has 14+4=<<14+4=18>>18 blue squares.
With 6 more green than blue squares, the comforter has 24 green squares.
With 12 fewer white squares than green squares, the comforter has 12 white squares.
In total, the comforter has 14+18+24+12 = <<14+18+24+12=68>>68 squares that are 1-foot by 1-foot in size.
Since each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, then each square equals one square foot.

Total number of people = Number of adults + Number of babies
Total number of people = 42 + 15
Total number of people = 57

Step 2: Find out the number of regular chairs at Mia's restaurant.
We know that there are 8 high chairs, and there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So,
Number of regular chairs = 8 * 5
Number of regular chairs = 40

Step 3: Determine how many chairs Mia needs in total.
Total number of chairs = Number of regular chairs + Number of high chairs
Total number of chairs = 40 + 8
Total number of chairs = 48

Step 4: Find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get.
Add the number of chairs she already has to the number of chairs she needs and subtract the result from the total number of chairs she wants.

Number of chairs she needs to get = Total number of chairs - Number of chairs she already has
Number of chairs she needs to get = 48 - 48
Number of chairs she needs to get = {0}

Since the question asks for the number of chairs Mia ""has to get"", but based on the given information, she doesn't actually need to get any more chairs.

The total number of points is the sum of the points Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom have collected: 50 + 65 + 180 = 295 points.

Step 3: Find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip.
The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. The class has 400 - 295 = 105 points missing.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of fireworks in the city.
The city sets off 15 boxes of fireworks, and each box contains 20 fireworks. So, the city's fireworks display has a total of:
15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

Step 2: Calculate the number of fireworks Hannah can see from her house.
Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks display. So, the number of fireworks Hannah can see is:
300 fireworks * 0.4 = 120 fireworks

Step 3: Determine the number of fireworks Hannah sets off herself.
Hannah sets off 3 boxes of fireworks in her backyard, and each box contains 5 fireworks. So, she sets off a total of:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

Step 4: Find the total number of fireworks Hannah can observe.
Since Hannah can see 120 city fireworks and sets off 15 of her own, the total number of fireworks Hannah can observe is:
120 city fireworks + 15 Hannah's fireworks = 135 fireworks

{The final answer is: Hannah can observe a total of 135 fireworks on the 4th of July.}</s>","First find the total number of fireworks the city sets off: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of seats for each person, drinks, and snacks.
Since each seat has enough room to hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, the total number of items on each seat is 1 (person) + 2 (drinks) + 3 (snacks) = 6 items.

Step 2: Determine the number of seats for Aiden and his friends.
We know that Aiden and 12 of his friends are going to the cinema, so they will occupy 12 seats.

Step 3: Calculate the number of seats for Aiden's additional friends.
The problem states that they meet up with 7 more friends at the cinema, so there will be an additional 7 seats required.

Step 4: Find the total number of seats needed for all friends.
Total number of seats = Seats for Aiden and his friends + Seats for additional friends = 12 + 7 = 19 seats.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of items on each seat.
Total number of items = Total number of seats * Number of items per seat = 19 seats * 6 items = 114 items.

Step 6: Find out how many items correspond to drinks and snacks.
We know that the number of items for one person is 1, so the number of items for two drinks and three snacks is 2 + 3 = 5 items. Since all 5 items correspond to drinks and snacks, there will be 114 items * (5 items / 1 item) = 570 items of drinks and snacks.

Step 7: Calculate the total cost of drinks and snacks.
The cost for each item is given as $2, so the total cost for 570 items is 570 * $2 = $1,140.

The final answer is: The group has spent a total of $1,140 on snacks and drinks.</s>","Including Aiden, the whole group saves 1 + 12 + 7 = <<1+12+7=20>>20 seats.
In total, the seats can hold 2 drinks * 20 seats = <<2*20=40>>40 drinks.
In total, the seats can hold 3 snacks * 20 seats = <<3*20=60>>60 snacks.
So in total, the group buys 40 drinks + 60 snacks = <<40+60=100>>100 items.
As snacks and drinks cost $2 each, the group has spent 100 items * $2 = $<<100*2=200>>200 overall.

step 3: When the three trucks combine, they can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. So the sum of the weight that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul is 4,000 + 4,800 = <<4000+4800=8800>> 8,800 pounds.
step 4: To find the number of pounds that Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the weight that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total weight the three trucks can carry: 11,600 - 8,800 = <<11600-8800=2800>> 2,800 pounds.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of individuals in the group.
Total number of people = Number of males + Number of females
Total number of people = 8 males + 6 females
Total number of people = 14

Step 2: Determine the number of dumplings each female ate.
Each female ate 3 dumplings.

Step 3: Determine the number of dumplings each male ate.
Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female,
Number of dumplings each male ate = Number of dumplings each female ate + 1
Number of dumplings each male ate = 3 dumplings + 1 = 4 dumplings

Step 4: Determine the total number of dumplings that were eaten.
Total number of dumplings eaten = Number of dumplings each person ate × Total number of people
Total number of dumplings eaten = 4 dumplings (per male) × 8 males + 3 dumplings (per female) × 6 females
Total number of dumplings eaten = 32 dumplings + 18 dumplings = 50 dumplings

Step 5: Since there were no leftovers, the number of dumplings Larry cooked equals the total number of dumplings eaten.
{The final answer is: Larry cooked 50 dumplings.}</s>","So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.
Hence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.

                 [/INST] To find how much money Gerald and Julia each had before Gerald spent $10 on a book, we first need to find out how much money each got according to the given 3:2 ratio.

Step 1: Find the total amount of money spent on the ratio.
The sum of parts in a ratio represents the total amount spent on that ratio. As in this question, Gerald got 3 parts and Julia got 2 parts and the total amount of money is $100.
3 parts (Gerald) + 2 parts (Julia) = total parts
Gerald's part = 3
Julia's part = 2

Step 2: Calculate how much money each got.
Multiply the total amount of money ($100) by the ratio of the parts that correspond to Gerald (3) and Julia (2):
Gerald's money = 3 * Total amount of money / (3 + 2)
Gerald's money = 3 * $100 / 5
Gerald's money = $60
Julia's money = 2 * Total amount of money / (3 + 2)
Julia's money = 2 * $100 / 5
Julia's money = $40

Step 3: Find how much money Gerald had left.
Subtract the amount spent on the book ($10) from Gerald's initial amount ($60):
Gerald's money left = Gerald's initial money - book price
Gerald's money left = $60 - $10
Gerald's money left = $50

The final answer is: Gerald had $50 left after spending $10 on the book.</s>","The $100 was divided into 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 parts.
So each part is $100/5 = $<<100/5=20>>20.
So Gerald received $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.
Gerald bought a book at $<<10=10>>10.
Therefore, Gerald was left with $60 - $10 = $<<60-10=50>>50.

                 [/INST] To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the speed of the turtle in relation to the cat's speed.

Given that Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Let's calculate that:

1. The cat runs at 15 feet per second.
2. The cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, so the turtle's speed is:

Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5
= 15 feet/second / 5
= 3 feet/second

Now we can calculate how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:

Feet the turtle can crawl = Turtle's speed * Time
= 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
= 120 feet

So, {The final answer is 120 feet.}</s>","First find the speed of the turtle by dividing the cat's speed by 5: 15 feet/second / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 feet/second

Step 1: A percentage of 40% of the river's water is used by Colorado City.

Step 2: Of that amount, 80% is used for industrial purposes.

Step 3: To find the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes, multiply the percentage of the river's water used by the city (40%) by the percentage of that water used for industrial purposes (80%):

Industrial water usage = 0.4 (percentage of water used by Colorado City) x 0.8 (percentage of that water used for industrial purposes)

Industrial water usage = 0.32 (or 32%)

Step 4: To find the percentage of the river's water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, subtract the percentage of water used for industrial purposes from the percentage of water used by the city:

Non-industrial water usage = Total water usage by Colorado City - Industrial water usage

Non-industrial water usage = 0.4 (percentage of water used by Colorado City) - 0.32 (percentage of that water used for industrial purposes)

Step 2: Calculate the cost for two weeks of tutoring. Since there are two weeks in this scenario, the cost would be:

Cost for 2 weeks = Cost for one week * 2
Cost for 2 weeks = $84 * 2
Cost for 2 weeks = $168

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many quarts of chocolate ice cream are made in 2 hours.
Chocolate ice cream is made at a rate of 100 quarts per hour. So, in 2 hours, the factory makes:
100 quarts/hour * 2 hours = 200 quarts

Step 2: Determine how many quarts of vanilla ice cream are made in 4 hours.
Vanilla ice cream is made at a rate of 50 quarts per hour. So, in 4 hours, the factory makes:
50 quarts/hour * 4 hours = 200 quarts

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours.
First, find the total number of hours needed to produce the quantities given:
Chocolate ice cream: 2 hours
Vanilla ice cream: 4 hours
Total hours: 2 hours (chocolate) + 4 hours (vanilla) = 6 hours

Since we wanted to find the total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours, and we know that the factory can produce 200 quarts of ice cream in 6 hours, we can calculate the amount of ice cream made in 48 hours by:
200 quarts/6 hours * 48 hours = 1152 quarts

{The final answer is 1152 quarts}</s>","Chocolate ice cream can be made at 100 quarts / 2 hours = <<100/2=50>>50 quarts per hour.
Vanilla ice cream can be made at 50 quarts / 4 hours = <<50/4=12.5>>12.5 quarts per hour.
In 48 hours there would be 48 * 50 quarts = <<48*50=2400>>2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.
In 48 hours there would be 48 * 12.5 quarts = <<48*12.5=600>>600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.
Combined there would be 2400 chocolate + 600 vanilla = <<2400+600=3000>>3000 quarts of ice cream.

James paid $20 for entering the blueberry farm, so the cost of picking is $20.
He picked 30 pounds of blueberries at a cost of $1.5 per pound. So, the cost of blueberries picked = $1.5/pound * 30 pounds = $45.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of blueberries bought from the store.
The cost of blueberries from the store is $2.5 per pound. So, the cost of 30 pounds of blueberries = $2.5/pound * 30 pounds = $75.

Step 3: Calculate the savings.
Savings = Cost of blueberries from the store - Cost of blueberries picked
Savings = $75 - $45
Savings = $30.

Step 2: Now we know that the price of each computer is 10% higher than the planned budget. We need to find out what the new price of one computer is.
10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70 (increase in price)
New price = Original price + Increase in price
New price = $700 + $70 = $770

Step 3: Now that we have the new price of one computer, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers.

John makes a 6 egg omelet, so {The number of eggs is 6}.

Step 2: Calculate the calories from the eggs.
Each egg is 75 calories, so the calories from 6 eggs would be 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = {Total calories from eggs: 450}.

Step 3: Calculate the calories from the cheese.
The omelet has 2 oz of cheese, so the calories would be 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = {Total calories from cheese: 240}.

Step 4: Calculate the calories from the ham.
The omelet has an equal amount of ham as the eggs, which is also 6 portions (since there are 6 eggs). Assuming each portion of ham is also 2 oz, the calories would be 6 portions * 2 oz/portion * 40 calories/oz = {Total calories from ham: 240}.

Step 5: Calculate the total calories in the omelet.
Total calories = Total calories from eggs + Total calories from cheese + Total calories from ham
Total calories = 450 calories + 240 calories + 240 calories = {Total calories in the omelet: 930}.

1. The cost of a pencil is $0.50, and the cost of an eraser is $0.25.
2. You bought 6 pencils, so the cost of the pencils is 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.
3. You also bought 8 erasers, so the cost of the erasers is 8 * $0.25 = $2.00.
4. The total cost of the pencils and erasers is $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00.
5. You paid $10 for the pencils, erasers, and any potential taxes or fees.
6. To find the change you received, subtract the cost of the pencils and erasers from the amount you paid: $10 - $5.00 = $5.00.

However, this answer doesn't make much sense in the context of this problem since the change should be a negative value. The actual calculation of the change should be: $10 - $5.00 = $5.00 or -$5.00.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many sacks of rice Goldy bought in total. From the given information, we know that Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice.

Step 2: Determine how many sacks of rice were given to Goldy's cousin. The problem states that she gave 3 sacks to her cousin, so we now know that Goldy gave away 3 sacks of rice.

Step 3: Determine how many sacks of rice were given to Goldy's brother. The problem states that she gave 4 sacks to her brother, so we now know that Goldy gave away 4 sacks of rice.

Step 4: Calculate the number of kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin. We know that there are 25 kg of rice per sack, so 3 sacks of rice would equal 3 * 25 = 75 kg of rice.

Step 5: Calculate the number of kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her brother. We know that 3 sacks of rice were given to her cousin, so 4 sacks must have been given to her brother. Therefore, 4 sacks of rice equal 4 * 25 = 100 kg of rice.

Step 6: Find the total amount of rice Goldy had after giving some away. We know she bought 20 sacks of rice, gave 3 sacks to her cousin, and gave 4 sacks to her brother. This leaves a remaining amount of 20 - 3 - 4 = 13 sacks of rice.

Step 7: Calculate the total amount of rice Goldy had at the beginning. We know that 13 sacks of rice remain, and we can calculate how much rice was in those sacks by multiplying the number of sacks by the weight of each sack: 13 sacks * 25 kg/sack = 325 kg of rice.

Step 8: Check that our answers are consistent with the information given. Our calculation shows that 75 kg of rice were given to the cousin and 100 kg were given to the brother, which together amounts to 175 kg (75 + 100). The problem states that there are 25 kg of rice per sack, so 13 sacks contain 13 * 25 = 325 kg of rice, which is also consistent with our calculation.

The final answer is: Goldy gave her cousin 75 kg of rice and her brother 100 kg of rice.</s>","Goldy gave a total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 sacks of rice to his brother and cousin.

                 [/INST] To find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week compared to last week, we need to subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week.

First, let's find out how many boxes of cereal Castle bought this week:
- She bought 3 boxes of Cocoa Puffs.
- She bought 5 boxes of Fruit Loops.
- Total boxes this week = 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 boxes

Next, let's find out how many boxes of cereal Castle bought last week:
- She bought 4 boxes of cereal last week.

Finally, to find out how many more boxes she bought this week compared to last week, we subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week:
- Difference in boxes = Boxes this week - Boxes last week
- Difference in boxes = 8 - 4 = <<8-4=4>>4 boxes

{The final answer is: 4 boxes}. Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week compared to last week.</s>","Castle has 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 boxes of cereals this week.
Therefore, Castle bought 8 - 4 = <<8-4=4>>4 more boxes of cereals this week than last week.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's calculate how many times Helga taps each foot per minute when her arms are at her sides.

- For her right foot: 300 taps per minute
- For her left foot: 250 taps per minute

Step 2: Next, let's find out how many times she taps each foot per minute when her arms are raised.

- For her right foot: 200 taps per minute
- For her left foot: 200 taps per minute

Step 3: Now, let's calculate how many times she taps both feet combined when her arms are at her sides.

Total taps per minute with arms at sides = 300 (right foot) + 250 (left foot) = 550 taps per minute

Step 4: Helga raises her arms during 2 out of 5 minutes, so the time she spends with her arms raised is 2 minutes. This means she spends 3 minutes with her arms at her sides.

Step 5: Since her total tap rate when arms are at her sides is 550 taps per minute, a 3-minute interval would result in 550 x 3 = 1650 taps.

Step 6: During the other 2 minutes when her arms are raised, her tap rate for each foot decreases to 200 taps per minute. However, since we want to find the combined total number of times both feet tap, we can just multiply the tap rate when her arms are raised (200 taps/minute) by the number of minutes she spends with her arms raised (2 minutes).

So, combined taps during 2 minutes with arms raised = 200 (taps/minute) x 2 (minutes) = 400 taps

Step 7: Add the number of combined taps when her arms are at her sides (1650) to the number of combined taps when her arms are raised (400).

The final answer is: 1650 (arms at sides) + 400 (arms raised) = 2050 taps (The final answer is: 2050)</s>","During the 5 minutes of dancing, 2 minutes were performed with hands raised and 5-2=3 minutes were performed without hands raised.
With hands not raised, her right foot tapped 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 times.
With hands not raised, her left foot tapped 3*250=<<3*250=750>>750 times.
With hands raised, her right foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.
With hands raised, her left foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.
Thus, in total, she tapped 900+750+400+400=<<900+750+400+400=2450>>2450 times

- Ron would be fined $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of buying asphalt for Ron to fix the pothole.
- Ron needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.
- Therefore, the total cost of asphalt is: 3 * $25 = $75.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost Ron would incur if he fixes the pothole himself.
- The cost of the fine is $120.
- The cost of asphalt is $75.
- Therefore, the total cost is $120 + $75 = $195.

Step 5: Compare the cost of not fixing the pothole with the cost of fixing it himself to find the savings.
- The cost of not fixing the pothole is $450.
- The cost of fixing it himself is $195.
- Therefore, the savings Ron would make by fixing the pothole himself is: $450 - $195 = $255.

1. Determine the initial number of chairs.
   The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs.
   So, the total number of chairs is 170 (normal) + 23 (baby) = 193 chairs.

2. Subtract the number of chairs sent for repair.
   The problem states that 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs were sent for repair.
   So, the number of chairs currently at the restaurant is:
   193 (initial) - 20 (normal chairs sent for repair) - 13 (baby chairs sent for repair) = 160 chairs.

{The final answer is 160 chairs.}</s>","Before sending the chairs and baby chairs to the carpenter the restaurant had 170 + 23 = <<170+23=193>>193 chairs.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Bryce and 4 of his friends ordered pizzas after football practice. Let's find out how many pizzas were ordered in total. Since Bryce is one of the friends, we have:
Number of pizzas = Number of friends (including Bryce) - 1
 Number of pizzas = 4 + 1 = 5

Step 2: Each pizza had 12 slices, so we can calculate the total number of slices of pizza consumed as follows:
Slices consumed by Bryce and 2 friends = 2/3 * Number of pizzas * 12
 = 2/3 * 5 * 12
 = 20 * 12
 = 240 slices

Step 3: The 2 remaining friends consumed 3/4 of their pizzas:
Slices consumed by the remaining friends = 3/4 * Number of pizzas * 12
 = 3/4 * 5 * 12
 = 15 * 12
 = 180 slices

Step 4: Now, we need to find out how many slices were left. The total number of slices ordered is:
Total slices ordered = Number of pizzas * 12
 = 5 * 12
 = 60

Step 5: We know that 240 slices were consumed, so the number of slices left is:
Slices left = Total slices ordered - Slices consumed
 = 60 - 240 + 180
 = 181

However, since the number of slices cannot be a fraction, this question might have a mistake. The given information doesn't seem to be consistent. {The final answer is not provided in this problem due to inconsistent information.}</s>","Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.
Of the 60 total slices of pizza, the friends ate 42, and 60 slices – 42 slices = <<60-42=18>>18 slices of pizza were left.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many sausages the cat eats in one minute.
The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. To find out how many sausages the cat eats in one minute, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes the cat to eat one sausage. We know that:

1 sausage = 30 minutes / 9 sausages

To find the time it takes the cat to eat one sausage, we invert the proportion:

time per sausage = 30 minutes / 9 sausages = 3.3333 minutes (approximately)

So, the cat takes about 3.3333 minutes to eat one sausage.

Step 2: Find out how many sausages the dog eats in one minute.
We know that the dog eats the same number of sausages as the cat in 2/3 of the time the cat takes. Therefore, the time it takes the dog to eat one sausage is:

time per sausage (dog) = time per sausage (cat) * (2/3)
time per sausage (dog) = 3.3333 minutes * (2/3)
time per sausage (dog) = 2.2222 minutes (approximately)

To find out how many sausages the dog eats in one minute, we use the same proportion we used for the cat:

1 sausage = time per sausage (dog) / number of sausages (dog)

Let X be the number of sausages the dog eats in one minute. Then, we have:

1 sausage = 2.2222 minutes / X

Step 3: Calculate the average time they take to eat the sausages.
First, we need to find the total time it takes each animal to eat all the sausages. Since both animals eat the same number of sausages, we can calculate this value based on the time it takes them to eat one sausage:

total time (cat) = 9 sausages * 3.3333 minutes/sausage = 30 minutes
total time (dog) = 9 sausages * 2.2222 minutes/sausage ≈ 19.8 minutes

Let's calculate the average time they spend eating the sausages:

average time/sausage = (total time (cat) + total time (dog)) / number of sausages
average time/sausage = (30 minutes + 19.8 minutes) / 18 sausages
average time/sausage = 2.8339 minutes (approximately)

Since we're looking for the average time they spend eating one sausage, we need to find the reciprocal of this value:

average time per sausage = 1 minute / 2.8339 minutes/sausage ≈ 0.3525 minutes (approximately)

The final answer is the average time they take to eat one sausage: 0.3525 minutes (approximately).</s>","If the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes 2/3*30 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 minutes.
The total amount of time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.
The average time in minutes that the two take to eat the sausages is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x (in inches). According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches, which is equal to 96 inches. The difference in length between one of Topher's shoes and one of Bobby's shoes is given as 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.

So, we have the equation: 9x + 10 = 96

Step 2: Solve the equation for x. First, subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 86
Next, divide both sides by 9: x = 9.5 (approximately)

Step 3: Double the length of one of Bobby's shoes to find the length of a pair since Topher's shoe length was given as a pair's length.

Length of one pair of Bobby's shoes = 2 * x
= 2 * 9.5 inches
= 19 inches

So, the final answer is that one of Bobby's shoes is approximately 9.5 inches long, and a pair would be about 19 inches long.</s>","Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.
Subtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90
Solving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10

                 [/INST] To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we first need to determine the number of people who had voted by that time.

1. At 8:00, 5000 people were in line at the polling station.
2. By midday (12:00), 2/5 (or 4000) of the people had voted, so 5000 * 2/5 = 10,000 people had voted.
3. By 16:00, 2/3 (or 6666.67, rounded down to 6666) of the remaining people had voted.

The total number of voters by 16:00 is:
10,000 (who voted by midday) + 6666 (who voted by 16:00)
Total voters = 16,666

Since the initial number of people in line was 5000, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
5000 (total people) - 16,666 (people who had voted)

The final answer is: 5,000 - 16,666 = -1,666.6 <sub>This answer is negative because the number of people who had not voted cannot be less than the initial number of people in line. The actual number of people who had not voted is 5,000 - 16,666 = -1,666.6, but since we can't have a negative number of people, we need to adjust our reasoning.</sub>

The error in the problem statement may be intentional to test problem-solving skills, but in real-life situations, it's important to note that the number of people who have not voted cannot be less than the initial number of people in line.

To find the correct answer, we subtract the number of people who have voted from the initial number of people in line: 5,000 (total people) - 10,000 (people who voted by midday) - 6,666 (people who voted by 16:00) = 1,668.

The final answer is: {The final answer is 1,668 people had not voted by 16:00.}</s>","If the number of people who turned up to vote was 5000, by midday 2/5*5000 = <<2/5*5000=2000>>2000 had voted.

By 16:00, the additional number of voters who had cast their vote is 2/3*3000 = <<2/3*3000=2000>>2000
The number of people who had not cast their votes by 16:00 is 3000-2000 = <<3000-2000=1000>>1000 voters.

We know Parker uses 4 pieces of gum per day. So, to find out how many pieces he uses in 30 days, we need to multiply the number of pieces he uses per day by the number of days.

4 pieces of gum/day * 30 days = 120 pieces of gum

Step 2: Find out how many packs of gum Parker needs to buy.
We know that a pack of gum has 15 pieces. So, to find out how many packs he needs to buy, we need to divide the total number of pieces he needs by the number of pieces in a pack.

120 pieces of gum / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

{The final answer is: Parker needs to buy 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.}</s>","He chews 4 pieces of gum a day so over 30 days he will chew 4*30 = <<4*30=120>>120 pieces of gum

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores.

Step 2: Determine the number of smores needed for the kids.
9 kids want 2 smores each. So, the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18 smores.

Step 3: Determine the number of smores needed for the adults.
6 adults will eat 1 smore each. So, the total number of smores for adults is 6.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of smores needed.
Total number of smores = smores for kids + smores for adults = 18 + 6 = 24 smores.

Step 5: Determine the number of sleeves of graham crackers needed to make 24 smores.
Since one sleeve makes 8 smores, we need 24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves to make the required smores.

Step 6: Calculate the number of boxes required to get 3 sleeves.
Assuming each box contains 3 sleeves, we will need 3/3 = 1 box to get 3 sleeves.

                 [/INST] To find out how much money each sibling got, we first need to determine how many siblings Greg has and then divide the total amount of money by the number of siblings to find out how much each one gets.

Given data: Greg found $20 with his younger siblings. He decided to split the money equally among them.

Step 1: Identify the number of siblings.
The problem states that Greg is walking down the street with ""his"" younger siblings. This implies that Greg is an elder sibling. However, we don't know how many younger siblings he has.

Step 2: Assume the number of siblings.
To calculate the amount each sibling receives, we need to know the total number of siblings. As we don't have exact information, we'll assume there are 'n' siblings (including Greg himself), and use 'n-1' to represent the number of younger siblings.

Step 3: Determine the amount each sibling gets.
Using the given information, we know that the total amount of money is $20. To find the amount each sibling receives, we can divide the total amount of money by the total number of siblings:

Amount per sibling = Total amount of money / Total number of siblings
Amount per sibling = $20 / (n + 1)

Step 4: Clarify the solution.
The problem neither states how many younger siblings Greg has nor provides enough context to come up with a definite answer about the number of siblings. Therefore, without that information, it's impossible to provide an exact numerical answer. We can only give a mathematical expression to determine the amount each sibling will receive if we know the number of siblings.

The final answer is the mathematical expression: Amount per sibling = $20 / (n + 1), where n represents the number of younger siblings.</s>","Greg and his 3 siblings equal 3 people + 1 person = <<3+1=4>>4 people.
The 20 dollars were divided equally, so each of them received $20 / 4 people = <<20/4=5>>5 dollars/person

2. Cindy also has a French book that weighs 4 pounds.
3. And she has an English book that weighs 3 pounds.
4. The history book weighs twice as much as the English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds as well.

- A gallon jar costs $5, and a half-gallon jar costs $2 less.

Step 2: Find the cost of a half-gallon jar.
- Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and a half-gallon jar costs $2 less, we can find the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from the cost of a gallon.
- Half-gallon jar cost = Gallon jar cost - $2
- Half-gallon jar cost = $5 - $2
- Half-gallon jar cost = $3

Step 3: Calculate the cost of 10-gallon jars.

Step 2: Finding the number of students who like to play music:
- We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who prefer playing basketball.
- There are 5 students who prefer playing basketball.
- So, the number of students who like to play music = 2 * Number of students who prefer playing basketball = 2 * 5 = 10

Step 3: Finding the number of students who like to play video games:
- We know that the number of students who like to play video games or music is equal to the total number of students minus the number of students who like to bake and the number of students who prefer playing basketball.
- The total number of students = 50
- The number of students who like to bake = 10
- The number of students who prefer playing basketball = 5
- The number of students who like to play music = 10
- Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games = Total number of students - Number of students who like to bake - Number of students who prefer playing basketball - Number of students who like to play music

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that two classes in a certain school have a total of 80 students.
2. Each class has the same amount of students.
3. In each class, 40% of the students are girls.

Let's denote the number of students in each class as ""x"". Since there are two classes and the total number of students is 80, we have:
x + x = 80

Solving this equation, we get:
x = 40

So each class has 40 students. Now we need to find out how many boys are in each class since 40% of the students are girls.

To find the number of boys in one class:
Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls
Number of boys = 40 - (0.4 * 40)

Calculating this:
Number of boys = 40 - (0.4 * 40)
Number of boys = 40 - 16
Number of boys = 24

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class. {The final answer is 24 boys in each class}.</s>","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.
The girls in each class make up to 40%, so there are 40/100 * 40 = <<40/100*40=16>>16 girls in each of them.
That means the rest of the class are boys, so there are 40 - 16 = <<40-16=24>>24 boys in each class.

                 [/INST] To find out how many animals Melissa groomes each day of the week, we first need to find out how many animals need grooming in total and then divide that number by the number of days in a week.

1. First, let's find the total number of animals Melissa needs to groom:
   - Dogs: 8
   - Cats: 5
   - Birds: 3
   - Horses: 12

   The total number of animals is: 8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 26 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 46 animals

2. Next, we'll divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week (7 days):

   The number of animals Melissa grooms each day is: 46 animals / 7 days = approximately 6.6 animals per day

3. Since Melissa cannot groom a fraction of an animal, she would need to groom an entire animal for each day. Therefore, she would groom as many animals as the quotient is, and then the remaining animals would be groomed in the next day. In this case, with 6 animals groomed per day, there would be 2 extra animals that need to be groomed on the last day of the week.

   The final answer is: Melissa grooms 6 animals each day of the week, with 2 extra animals groomed on the last day. Therefore, she grooms a total of 6 * 6 + 2 = 38 animals throughout the week.</s>","Melissa has 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = <<8+5+3+12=28>>28 animals to groom over the next week.

Step 2: Determine how much money the vendor used to spend on tomatoes per day and per week with the old vendor.
Price per tomato with old vendor = $0.5
Money spent on tomatoes per day with old vendor = Price per tomato * Tomatoes bought per day
Money spent on tomatoes per day with old vendor = $0.5 * 500 = $250

1. We have 54 students who need to be divided into groups.
2. Each group should have an equal number of students, and we want to form 6 such groups.

First, let's find out how many students should be in each group:

3. Total number of students (54) / Number of desired groups (6) = approximately 9 students per group

However, since we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll need to find the smallest number of students that can be added to each group to reach a number equal to or greater than 9. This number is 10, as 9 students and 1 additional student make up 10 students in total.

So, we'll actually need 10 students per group.Now let's calculate how many students we need for the 12 required groups:

4. Total number of students (54) / Number of required groups (12) = approximately 4.5 students per group

As discussed earlier, we can't have a fraction of a student, so we'll need to find the smallest number of students that can be added to each group to reach a number equal to or greater than 5 students. This number is 6, as 5 students and 1 additional student make up 6 students in total.

So, we'll actually need 6 students per group for the 12 required groups.

5. To find out how many more groups we need, we first need to find out how many students we have in total for the 12 required groups:
Total number of students for 12 groups = 12 groups * 6 students/group = 72 students

Next, let's find out how many students there are in total:

6. Total number of students = 54 students

Finally, we can subtract the number of students used for the 12 required groups from the total number of students to find out how many more students are needed:

7. Difference between the total number of students and the number of students in 12 groups = 54 students - 72 students = -18 students

However, since we cannot have a negative number, this implies that we actually do not need any additional groups or students.
{ Final answer: No additional groups or students are needed.}

Hope this helps! Is there anything else I can help you with? 😊</s>","There are 54/6 = <<54/6=9>>9 groups formed from the 54 students.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of large buttons Lorraine has as X and the number of small buttons she has as Y.

From the problem, we know that:
1. A large sticker is worth one large button or three small buttons. So, one large button is worth 1 + 3 = 4 small stickers.
2. One small sticker is worth one small button.
3. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
4. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons, so she trades 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers for large buttons.
5. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, so she trades 0.5 * 40 = 20 large buttons for large buttons.
6. The rest of her large stickers are traded for small buttons. Since she starts with 40 large stickers and trades 20 for large buttons, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left to trade for small buttons.

To find out how many small buttons she gets for these 20 large stickers, we need to know how many small stickers one large sticker is worth. We've already established that one large sticker is worth 4 small stickers.

So, 20 large stickers are worth 20 * 4 = 80 small stickers.

We also know she started with 30 small stickers. So now, her total number of small stickers is 30 + 80 = 110 small stickers.

Since one small sticker is worth one small button, Lorraine has a total of 110 small buttons by the end.

1. We know that Joey plays football every ""?"" week. However, the problem states specific numbers of matches he played on Monday, Friday, and Saturday of the last week.
2. On Monday of the last week, Joey played ""2 matches.""
3. On Friday of the last week, he played ""1 match.""
4. On Saturday of the last week, he played ""double"" the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, he played 2 * 2 = ""4 matches"" on Saturday.
5. To find out how many matches Joey plays in one week, we need to add up the number of matches he played on Monday, Friday, and Saturday of the last week, and divide by the number of days in a week.
6. So, he played 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday, and 4 matches on Saturday. In total, he played 2 + 1 + 4 = ""7 matches"" in the last week.
7. There are 7 days in a week. So, to find out how many matches he plays in one week on average, we divide the total number of matches he played in the last week by the number of days in a week.
8. Therefore, {The final answer is: Joey plays 7 matches / 7 days = 1 match per day or 1 match per week}.

1. We know that the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it.
2. Let x be the number of votes against the new regulation.
3. Then, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x.
4. We are given that there are 33 people on the council.
5. Therefore, x + 2x = 33 (the total number of votes).
6. Combining like terms, we get 3x = 33.
7. Solving for x, we find x = 11 (the number of votes against the new regulation).
8. Using x, we can find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation: 2x = 2 * 11 = 22.

{The final answer is: 22 votes in favor of the new regulation}</s>","Let V be the number of votes against the new regulation.
There were twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation, so V + 2V = 3V = 33.

Therefore, there were 2V = 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

                 [/INST] To find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we need to determine the number of shirts in each size.

First, we know that 11 students need extra-small shirts.

Next, we're told that twice as many students need small size shirts as extra-small. So, we have 11 students in extra-small, and therefore 22 students in small size.

Then, we're told that four fewer students in size small need size medium shirts. However, since we already have the number of students in size small, we can determine the number of students in size medium by subtracting 4 from 22:

Students in size medium = Students in size small - 4
Students in size medium = 22 - 4
Students in size medium = 18

We're also told that half as many students need large size shirts as need medium size. So, we have 18 students in medium size, so:

Students in size large = (Students in size medium / 2)
Students in size large = (18 / 2)
Students in size large = 9

We know that six more students need extra-large shirts than students in large size. So, we have:

Students in size extra-large = Students in size large + 6
Students in size extra-large = 9 + 6
Students in size extra-large = 15

Therefore, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is:

Total shirts = Extra-small + Small + Medium + Large + Extra-large
Total shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15
Total shirts = 71

{The final answer is: Krissa ordered 71 shirts.}</s>","Krissa ordered 11 x 2 = <<11*2=22>>22 size small.
She ordered 22 - 4 = <<22-4=18>>18 size medium.

She ordered 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 size extra-large.
Altogether, Krissa ordered 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = <<11+22+18+9+15=75>>75 shirts.

                 [/INST] To find out how much you will pay after the discount, we first need to determine the amount of the discount. In this case, the discount is 5% of the original price.

Step 1: Calculate the discount amount.
Discount Amount = Original Price * Discount Rate
Discount Amount = $140 * 0.05

Step 2: Convert the discount rate from percent to decimal.
Discount Rate (Decimal) = Discount Rate (Percent) / 100
Discount Rate (Decimal) = 5 % / 100 = 0.05

Step 3: Multiply the original price by the discount rate to find the discount amount.
Discount Amount = $140 * 0.05
Discount Amount = $7.00

Step 4: Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price.

1. We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. So, we have: 0.2 * 50 = <<0.2*50=10>>10 people.
2. We also know that 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Let R be the number of remaining people, then we have: 0.6 * R = <<0.6*R=0.6R>>0.6R. Since there were 50 people to begin with, then R = 50 - 10 = <<50-10=40>>40 people. So, 0.6 * 40 = <<0.6*40=24>>24 people.
3. To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we need to subtract the number of people who think horses #2 and #7 will win from the total number of people: 50 - 10 - 24 = <<50-10-24=16>>16 people.

Step 2: We also know that 1/3 of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. So the number of Pomeranian girls is 1/3 * Number of Pomeranian puppies.

Step 3: We are given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So we can set up an equation: 1/3 * Number of Pomeranian puppies = 6.

Step 4: To find the number of Pomeranian puppies, we can cross-multiply and solve for the total number of Pomeranian puppies: 3 * Number of Pomeranian puppies = 2 * 6 * 3.

Step 5: Simplifying the equation: Number of Pomeranian puppies = 18 / 3.

Step 6: Since there are 3 in a denominator on the right side of the equation, we know that there are 6 in the denominator on the left side, so the number of Pomeranian puppies is 18 / 6 = 3 * 3 = 9.

We know that the three houses together need 250 cases of shingles. Since the third house needs double the number of shingles as the first, and the first house needs half as many as the second, we can set up the following equation:

shingles for second house = shingles for third house = 2 * shingles for first house
2 * shingles for first house + shingles for first house + shingles for first house = 250
3 * shingles for first house = 250
shingles for first house = 250 / 3

Step 3: Find out how many shingles the first house needs.
We know that the first house needs half as many shingles as the second house, so:

shingles for first house = 1/2 * shingles for second house
shingles for first house = 1/2 * (250 / 3)
shingles for first house = 125.33 (approximately)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a case, we will assume that the first house needs 126 cases of shingles instead.

Step 4: Find out how many shingles the third house needs.
We know that the third house needs double the number of shingles as the first:

shingles for third house = 2 * shingles for first house
shingles for third house = 2 * 126
shingles for third house = 252

{The final answer is 252 cases of shingles for the third house.}</s>","Let x be the number of cases of shingles for the second house
The first house needs 1/2 x cases of shingles
The third house needs 2(1/2)x=x cases of shingles
250=x+x+(1/2)x
250=(5/2)x
250(2/5)=100=x
The third house needs 100 cases of shingles

                 [/INST] To find the number of fruits George has, we first need to determine how many pears he has based on the information given about his bananas and the percentage increase in the number of pears compared to bananas.

1. We know that George has 45% more pears than bananas. Let's represent the number of bananas as 'x'.
2. Therefore, the number of pears is 'x + 0.45x' (since he has 45% more pears).
3. The total number of fruits George has is the sum of the number of bananas and the number of pears.
4. So, the total number of fruits is 'x + (x + 0.45x)'
5. Simplifying the equation, 'x + x + 0.45x' = '2x + 0.45x' = '2.45x'

Now we have '2.45x' as the total number of fruits. We're given that George has 200 bananas, so we can substitute that value into our equation.

'2.45x' = '200 + x'

To solve this equation, we'll first need to get 'x' (the number of bananas) by itself.

'2.45x - x = 200'
'1.45x = 200'
'x = 200 / 1.45'
'x = 138.89' (approximately)

It seems that there's a mistake in the provided information, as the number of bananas can't result in a non-integer number of fruits. Since we can't have a fractional number of fruits, we need to re-evaluate the given information.

III. Let's calculate the amount of money Tanya earned on Monday:
   A. She taught 4 classes.
   B. Each class lasts for an hour.
   C. So, she worked for 4 hours.
   D. Therefore, she earned $15 x 4 = $60 per hour.

1. We have the number of sales for each kind of scent (vanilla and fruity) on a given day.
2. We want to find the difference in the number of sales between vanilla and fruity scents.
3. First, let's calculate the total number of sales for vanilla scents and for fruity scents.

Total sales for vanilla scents = Number of vanilla scents sold

Total sales for fruity scents = Number of fruity scents sold
= 2 (sales for each fruity scent) * Number of fruity scents
= 2 * 8 (since there are 8 fruity scents)

4. Now, we can calculate the difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents.

Difference in sales = Total sales for vanilla scents - Total sales for fruity scents

Money from eggplants = Number of eggplants * Price per eggplant
= 20 * $3

Next, we need to find out how many ears of corn Bennet needs to sell to make a total of $135. We already know he made $60 from selling eggplants, so we'll find out how much he needs to make from selling corn:

Money needed from corn = Total money - Money from eggplants
= $135 - $60
= $75

Finally, to find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to divide the amount of money he needs to make from corn by the number of ears of corn he has:

Price per ear of corn = Money needed from corn / Number of ears of corn
= $75 / 25
= $3

However, this answer seems incorrect because it's the same price per eggplant. Let's check the arithmetic.

1. Anthony had 50 pencils.
2. He gave half of his pencils to Brandon:
   - Half of 50 is 25 pencils.
3. He gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie.
   - Let's call the number of pencils Anthony had left after giving some to Brandon 'x'.
   - He gave 3/5 of 'x' to Charlie.
4. To find the number of pencils Charlie got, we calculate:
   - Charlie got 3/5 * x.
5. To find the number of pencils Anthony kept, we find the difference between the initial amount and the amount given to Brandon and Charlie:
   - Anthony kept 'x' - 25 - (3/5 * x).

Let's simplify the equation to find 'x' and, consequently, the number of pencils Anthony kept.

x - 25 - (3/5 * x)
x - 25 = 3/5 * x
x(1 - 3/5) = 25
x = 25 / (1 - 3/5)

To calculate the value of 'x', let's solve the fraction first:
5/5 - 3/5 = 2/5
1 - 3/5 = 2/5

Now we can find the value of 'x':
x = 25 / (2/5)
x = 25 * (1/2)
x = 12.5 * 5
x = 62.5

Since we cannot have a fractional number of pencils, it seems that there is a mistake in the problem.

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the number of wheels Henry needs for assembling cars and motorcycles step by step:

1. Henry needs to assemble 57 cars. Each car requires 4 wheels.
2. Therefore, Henry needs 57 * 4 = <<57*4=228>>228 wheels for cars.
3. Henry also needs to assemble 73 motorcycles. Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
4. Therefore, Henry needs 73 * 2 = <<73*2=146>>146 wheels for motorcycles.
5. In total, Henry needs 228 + 146 = <<228+146=374>>374 wheels to assemble all the toys.

{The final answer is: Henry would have 650 - 374 = <<650-374=276>>276 wheels left in the box.}</s>","The total number of wheels needed for all the cars is 57 cars x 4 wheels/car = <<57*4=228>>228 wheels

Combining the number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles gives a total of 228 wheels + 146 wheels = <<228+146=374>>374 wheels
The number of wheels left in the bag will be 650 wheels – 374 wheels = <<650-374=276>>276 wheels

One third of 600 movies is: 600 * (1/3) = 200 movies

Step 2: Calculate the cost of movies in various series.
Each movie in various series costs $6, so the total cost for these movies is: 200 movies * $6 = $1200

Step 3: Calculate the number of older movies.
Half of the remaining movies is: 600 - 200 = 400 movies. 40% of these movies are older movies, so there are: 400 movies * (1/2) = 200 older movies

Step 4: Calculate the cost of older movies.
Each older movie costs $5, so the total cost for these movies is: 200 older movies * $5 = $1000

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the remaining movies that aren't in series or old.
There are 600 total movies, 200 in series, and 200 older movies. That leaves 200 movies that aren't in series or old. These movies cost $10 each, so the total cost for these movies is: 200 movies * $10 = $2000

Step 6: Calculate the total cost of replacing all movies.
The cost of movies in various series is $1200, the cost of older movies is $1000, and the cost of the remaining movies is $2000. So the total cost is: $1200 + $1000 + $2000 = $4200

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step:

1. The Llesis family drove for 6 hours and hiked for 1.5 hours.
2. They drove an average of 50 miles per hour, and hiked an average of half their driving speed.
3. Therefore, they hiked an average of 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total distance travelled during their vacation. Since they drove for 6 hours and hiked for 1.5 hours, they spent a total of 6 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours on travel:

1. Total distance travelled by car: Distance = Speed × Time → Distance = 50 miles/hour × 6 hours = 300 miles.
2. Distance hiked: Distance = Speed × Time → Distance = 25 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 37.5 miles.

So, the total distance travelled during their vacation is 300 miles (by car) + 37.5 miles (by hiking) = 337.5 miles.

Now, let's find the location of their vacation spot. Since the problem doesn't provide any specific information about the direction or route of their travel, the only definite piece of information available is the total distance travelled (337.5 miles). Unfortunately, this information alone is not enough to determine the precise location of their vacation spot.

{The final answer is: We cannot determine the exact location of their vacation spot without additional information.}</s>","Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.
Hence, their average speed hiking was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour.
So, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.
It took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.
So, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.
Therefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.

                 [/INST] To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the scores for each player and then find the difference. Let's call Ava's score X and Emma's score Y.

First, let's calculate the scores for each player based on the given information:

A) Avajumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on a total of (8 + Emma's enemies jump).
Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so she collects a total of (3 + Emma's berries).
Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes in (Emma's level time + 4).

Score for Ava (X) = Points for enemies + Points for berries + Points for time
X = (8 + Emma's enemies jump) * 10 + (3 + Emma's berries) + (Emma's level time + 4) * 30

B) Emma jumps on a total of ""Emma's enemies jump"" number of enemies.
Emma collects ""Emma's berries"" number of berries.
Emma finishes the level in ""Emma's level time"" seconds.

Score for Emma (Y) = Points for enemies + Points for berries + Points for time
Y = Emma's enemies jump * 10 + Emma's berries + Emma's level time * 30

C) To find the difference between their scores, subtract the score of Emma from the score of Ava.

Difference in scores = X - Y
= [(8 + Emma's enemies jump) * 10 + (3 + Emma's berries) + (Emma's level time + 4) * 30] - [Emma's enemies jump * 10 + Emma's berries + Emma's level time * 30]
= [(8 * 10 + 3 + ( Emma's level time + 4) * 30) - ( Emma's enemies jump * 10 + Emma's berries + Emma's level time * 30)]
= [8 * 10 + 3 + ( Emma's level time + 4) * 30 - ( Emma's enemies jump * 10 + Emma's berries + Emma's level time * 30)]

To find the final answer, we need more information about the number of enemies Emma jumped on, the number of berries she collected, and the time she took to finish the level. Once we have those values, we can calculate the difference between their scores.

{The final answer depends on the values of Emma's enemies jump, Emma's berries, and Emma's level time.}</s>","For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.
For collecting berries, Emma earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 fewer points than Ava.
For finishing the level faster, Emma earns 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 more points than Ava.
Overall, Emma has 120 – 80 - 15 = <<120-80-15=25>>25 more points than Ava.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem.
The problem states that four friends ordered a total of 4 pizzas for $64. Two of the pizzas cost $30 each, so we need to find the cost of the other two pizzas if they cost the same amount.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of two identical pizzas.
Since we know that two of the pizzas cost $30 each, and there are two of them, then the total cost of these two pizzas is $30 * 2 = $<<30*2=60>>60.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the other two identical pizzas.
Since the total cost of all four pizzas is $64, and we've already accounted for $60, then the cost of the other two pizzas must be $64 - $60 = $<<64-60=4>>4.

So, each of the other two pizzas cost $4.

                 [/INST] To find out how many times Chase and the Rider ride their bikes in a week, let's break down the problem into simpler parts:

Part 1: Riding on usual days
We know that they ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. So, the total number of rides on usual days is:

Total rides on usual days = Rides per day * Number of days
Total rides on usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days
Total rides on usual days = 15 rides

Part 2: Riding on other days
We also know that they ride twice the number of rides they have on usual days on two other days. So, the number of rides on those two days is:

Rides per other day = 2 * Rides per usual day
Rides per other day = 2 * 3 rides
Rides per other day = 6 rides

Since there are two other days, the total number of rides on those days is:

Total rides on other days = Rides per other day * Number of other days
Total rides on other days = 6 rides/day * 2 days
Total rides on other days = 12 rides

Part 3: Calculating total weekly rides
To find the total number of rides in a week, we add the number of rides on usual days and the number of rides on other days.

Total weekly rides = Total rides on usual days + Total rides on other days
Total weekly rides = 15 rides + 12 rides
Total weekly rides = 27 rides

{The final answer is: Chase and the Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.}</s>","Each person rides his bike 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 times for 5 days.
Together, they ride 15+15 = <<15+15=30>>30 times for five days.
Each person rides his bike 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 times for every day of the other two days.
This means each person rides 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 times on each day of the other two days.
The total for the other two days is 12+12 = <<12+12=24>>24
For the whole week the together ride 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 times

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Bob had 7 fish in his pond. out of which were orange and were white.
2. Since there were 3 orange fish, then the number of white fish must be 4 less than the total number of fish, that is 3 orange + 4 white = 7 fish => 4 white fish.
3. Bob wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store and had a sales assistant dip out 17 fish from the mixed tank of white and orange fish.
4. After adding the new fish to his pond, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.
5. Let x be the number of white fish Bob had initially in the pond. After buying new fish, Bob now has 2x orange fish and x white fish + the new white fish bought.
6. We know that 2x > x + x (the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish).
7. Solving the inequality 2x > 2x + x, we get x < 0, which is not possible since the number of fish cannot be negative.
8. Instead, let's consider that x + y = 7 (the initial number of fish), where x is the number of white fish and y is the number of orange fish.
9. We know that after buying new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as before, so y + z = 2y, where z is the number of new orange fish Bob bought.
10. Since Bob bought the same number of white and orange fish, we also have x + w = x + z, where w is the number of new white fish Bob bought.
11. Solving the equation x +w = x+z, we get z-w = z, which means w = z.
12. Therefore, Bob bought z new white fish at the store.

{The final answer is z white fish}.</s>","Bob started with 7 fish and bought seventeen, so he had 7 + 17 = <<7+17=24>>24 fish.
Let x = the number of white fish.
Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so 2*x + x = 24 fish
3*x = 24
x = 24/3 = <<24/3=8>>8 white fish.
Bob started with 4 white fish, so he bought 8 - 4 = 4 white fish at the store.

Gallons used per week:
- One-way distance between home and office: 5 miles
- Round-trip distance: 5 miles x 2 (one way for each trip) = 10 miles
- Fuel efficiency of Andy's car: 10 MPG (miles per gallon)

To find the number of gallons used per week, we divide the round-trip distance by Andy's car's fuel efficiency:

10 miles (round-trip distance) / 10 MPG (fuel efficiency) = 1 gallon

Since Andy makes this trip 5 days a week (Monday through Friday), the total number of gallons used per week is:

1 gallon/trip x 5 trips/week = 5 gallons/week

Now, let's calculate the total money spent per week on gas:

5 gallons/week x $3/gallon = $15/week

{The final answer is $15 per week}

Therefore, Andy spends $15 per week on gas for commuting to work.</s>","Between Monday to Friday there are 5 days
If the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles the total round trip distance Andy drives daily is 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 miles
That means he drives a total of 10 miles * 5 days = <<10*5=50>>50 miles per week
If his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, then his car is consuming a total of 50 miles / 10 MPG = <<50/10=5>>5 gallons of gas each week
Given that each gallon of gas costs $3, then his car is consuming 5 * $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 worth of gas each week

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem
Carrie received 10 twenty-dollar bills and an additional amount in quarters, which is 140 quarters. She intends to use this money for a lunch. The problem asks us to calculate the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch after spending 3/5 of her twenties and using all the quarters.

Step 2: Find the value of twenties and quarters
The amount of money Carrie received in twenties is 10 units * $20/unit = $200.
The amount of money Carrie received in quarters is 140 units * $0.25/unit = $35.

Step 3: Calculate the amount spent on twenties
Given that 3/5 of the twenties are spent, the amount spent on twenties is $200 * 3/5 = $266.67 (rounded to the nearest cent).

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Carrie brought to the lunch
The total amount of money Carrie brought to the lunch is the sum of the money spent on twenties and quarters: $266.67 + $35 = $291.67.

Step 5: The final answer
{The final answer is $291.67}.</s>","Since she spent all the quarters, she paid her lunch partly by quarters totaling 140*$0.25 = $<<140*0.25=35>>35
She also used 3/5*10 = <<3/5*10=6>>6 of the twenties to pay for the lunch.
The total amount of the twenties that she used is 6*$20 = $<<6*20=120>>120
She spent $120+$35 = $<<120+35=155>>155 on the lunch.

   - Smart TVs: One-fourth of 40 TVs = 40/4 = 10 TVs
   - Analog TVs: One-eighth of 40 TVs = 40/8 = 5 TVs
3. Now we know that there are 10 smart TVs, 5 analog TVs, and the remaining TVs are OLED TVs.
4. To find the number of OLED TVs, we just need to subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 10 - 5 = 25

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. John is raising money for a school trip.
2. He has applied for help from the school.
3. The school has decided to cover half the cost of the trip.

First, we need to find out how much the school is contributing to the trip costs. We know that the school is covering half of the costs, so:

School contribution = Trip costs * 0.5
School contribution = $300 * 0.5
School contribution = $150

Next, we need to find out how much John still needs to pay for the trip. We know that the school has covered half the costs, so we subtract the school's contribution from the total trip costs:

John's share = Trip costs - School contribution
John's share = $300 - $150
John's share = $150

Finally, we need to find out how much money John is missing to cover the whole trip cost if he has $50. We subtract the amount John currently has from the total amount he needs to pay:

Money missing = John's share - John's current funds
Money missing = $150 - $50
Money missing = $100

Therefore, the final answer is: John is missing $100 for the school trip.</s>","John's school has decided to pay 300 / 2 = $<<300/2=150>>150 for his trip.
In total John has covered 150 + 50 = $<<150+50=200>>200 for his trip
Therefore, John needs 300 - 200 = $<<300-200=100>>100 more for the trip.

                 [/INST] To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to keep the house above freezing temperature, we first need to determine the minimum temperature inside the house during the night.

The daytime temperature is given as 45 degrees. The nighttime temperature is 33 degrees colder than that, so:

Nighttime temperature = Daytime temperature - 33
Nighttime temperature = 45 - 33

Final answer (Step 1): Nighttime temperature is 12 degrees.

Since Carson needs to heat the house up by 5 degrees for every log burned, we can find out how many degrees he needs to raise the temperature to keep it above freezing (32 degrees) by calculating:

Desired temperature difference = Freezing temperature - Nighttime temperature
Desired temperature difference = 32 - 12

Final answer (Step 2): Carson needs to raise the temperature by 20 degrees.

Now, we can find out how many logs he needs to burn to reach this temperature difference by dividing the desired temperature difference by the temperature increase per log:

Number of logs = Desired temperature difference / Temperature increase per log

Final answer (Step 3): Number of logs = 20 / 5 = 4 logs.

However, in this example, we made an assumption that every log burns at a constant temperature increase (5 degrees). In reality, this might not be the case, and the actual number of logs required could differ. This calculation serves as a rough estimate, and Carson may need to adjust based on the actual temperature increase per log.

Even though the calculation may not be precise, we have provided an answer to the best of our knowledge given the information provided.

Final answer: Carson needs to burn approximately 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.</s>","First find the night-time temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees
Then find how much Carson needs to heat his house to avoid the pipes freezing: 32 degrees - 12 degrees = <<32-12=20>>20 degrees
Then divide the amount of heat Carson needs by the amount of heat each log produces: 20 degrees / 5 degrees/log = <<20/5=4>>4 logs

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There were 90 people at the county-level scavenger hunt.
2. These people needed to be split into smaller groups to begin the competition.
3. To create groups with different leaders, 9-person groups were formed.
4. There were three-fifths (3/5) of the number of groups that each had members bring back 2 seashells each.

First, let's determine how many groups there were with 9 people each:

{Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group}

{Number of groups = 90 / 9}

{Number of groups ≈ 10}

Since there cannot be exactly 10 groups of 9 people, there would be either 9 groups of 10 people or 11 groups of 8 people. However, the problem suggests that there are different leaders for each group, meaning there should be equal numbers of people in each group. Thus, we can assume there are 10 groups in total.

Now let's calculate how many seashells were brought back:

{Number of seashells = Number of groups * Number of seashells per group}

{Number of seashells = 10 * 2 * 3/5}

{Number of seashells = 20 * 3/5}

{Number of seashells = 12}

Since each group of 9 people brought back 2 seashells, it would be unlikely for only 12 seashells to have been brought back if each group brought back all their seashells. Instead, it is possible that the groups brought back seashells in increments of 3, where three groups handed over their 2 seashells each, resulting in a total of 12 seashells being brought back.

Therefore, {The final answer is that the groups brought back 12 seashells together}.</s>","Since the total number of people at the competition was 90, they formed 90/9=<<90/9=10>>10 groups after splitting into 9-person groups.
If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bringing back 2 seashells each, then 3/5*10=<<3/5*10=6>>6 groups had members bringing back 2 seashells.
Since each group had 9 people, the number of people in the 6 groups, who found 2 seashells each, was 6*9= <<6*9=54>>54.
The total number of seashells the 54 people brought is 54*2=<<54*2=108>>108 seashells.

                 [/INST] To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we first need to determine the size of the workforce after three months of hiring.

1. We know that the company hires 20 new employees every month, starting from an initial workforce of 200.
2. After the first month, the workforce size is 200 + 20 = 220 employees.
3. After the second month, the workforce size is 220 + 20 = 240 employees.
4. After the third month, the workforce size is 240 + 20 = 260 employees.

5. Now, we know that each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. So, the monthly payroll cost for the company is 260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000.
6. To find the total payroll cost over three months, we multiply the monthly payroll cost by 3: $1,040,000/month * 3 months = $3,120,000.

{The final answer is $3,120,000}</s>","If each month the company hire 20 new employees, the total number of employees in the company in the first month is 200 employees + 20 employees = <<200+20=220>>220 employees
If each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money paid by the employee to its workers in the first month is 220 employees * $4000/employee = $<<220*4000=880000>>880000
In the second month, 20 more workers are hired, bringing the total number of employees to 220 employees + 20 employees = 240 employees
The company pays a total of 240 employees * $4000/employee = $<<240*4000=960000>>960000 in wages for its employees in the second month.
When an additional 20 workers are hired in the third month, the total number of workers become 240 employees + 20 employees = <<240+20=260>>260 employees
In total, the company 260 employees * $4000/employee = $<<260*4000=1040000>>1040000 in wages on the third month.
The total amount of money the company pays to all its employees in the three months is $1040000 + $960000 + $880000 = <<1040000+960000+880000=2880000>>2880000

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long.
""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.

Step 2: Since the choir plans to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and ""Jingle Bells"" once, we need to find out the total duration of both songs.

Total duration of ""Deck the Halls"" = 150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds
Total duration of ""Jingle Bells"" = 240 seconds

Step 3: Add the total duration of both songs to find out the total caroling time.
Total caroling time = Total duration of ""Deck the Halls"" + Total duration of ""Jingle Bells"" = 300 seconds + 240 seconds

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Billy's initial hourly wage was $10.
2. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new hourly wage was $10.50.
3. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his hourly wage $11.50.
4. Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so Sally starts at $10.50 per hour.
5. Both Billy and Sally work 20 hours.
6. To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally in one work week (20 hours), we need to calculate the difference in their hourly wages: $11.50 (Billy) - $10.50 (Sally) = $1.00 per hour.
7. To find the total difference in earnings for one work week, we need to multiply this hourly wage difference by the number of hours worked: $1.00/hour * 20 hours = $20.

{The final answer is $20.}</s>","Billy has a salary of $10+0.50+$1.00=$<<10+0.5+1=11.50>>11.50 per hour.
Sally is paid $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, for a total of $10+$0.50=$<<10+0.5=10.50>>10.50 per hour.
If Billy works 20 hours, he will be paid 20*$11.50=$<<20*11.5=230>>230
If Sally works 20 hours, she will be paid 20*$10.50=$<<20*10.50=210>>210.
Thus, if both work 20 hours, Billy will be paid $230-$210=$20 more.

Step 2: Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's points. Let's calculate how many points that is:

Half of Pierson's points = 278 / 2 = 139.5
Nikita's points = Half of Pierson's points + 11
Nikita's points = 139.5 + 11
Nikita's points = 150.5

However, since you can't score half a point in bowling, we'll round Nikita's points to the nearest whole number: Nikita scored 151 points.

Step 3: To find the total number of points scored by both, add the points of Pierson and Nikita:

Total points = Pierson's points + Nikita's points = 278 + 151 = 429.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of students and teachers in the school.
There are 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class. So there are a total of:
40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Each class has 3 teachers, so there are a total of:
40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Step 2: Calculate the number of trees planted by students and teachers.
Students plant 1 tree each, so they plant a total of:
1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

Teachers plant 2 trees each, so they plant a total of:
120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Step 3: Add the number of trees planted by students and teachers.
Total number of trees planted = Trees by students + Trees by teachers
Total number of trees planted = 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees

With one tree planted per student, 1000 * 1 = <<1000*1=1000>>1000 trees are planted per student.
With 2 trees planted per teacher, 120 * 2 = <<120*2=240>>240 trees are planted per teacher.

1. First, we need to determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles has. So let's add up the numbers of each type of animal given in the problem:
   Total stuffed animals = 3 puppies + 5 koalas + 2 zebras + 4 frogs
   Total stuffed animals = 3 +5+2+4 = 14+4 = 18

2. Next, we need to find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy such that 30% of her total stuffed animals are goats. To find this, we first need to calculate 30% of the total number of stuffed animals.
   Number of stuffed goats = 0.3 * Total stuffed animals
   Number of stuffed goats = 0.3 * 18
   Number of stuffed goats = 5.4 * 1 (since we can't have a fraction of an animal)
   Number of stuffed goats = 6

Therefore, {The final answer is: Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats}.</s>","Let x = the number of stuffed goats.
The current number of stuffed animals are (puppies + koalas + zebras + frogs) or 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = <<3+5+2+4=14>>14 stuffed animals total.
Take the total stuffed animals, add x and divide by the number of stuffed goats to get to 30% or x / (14 + x) = .3
Cross multiply to get x = 0.42 + .3x
Subtract .3 x from each side, .7x = 0.42

1 week * 7 days/week * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours Kris plays in a week at 2 hours per day (extra).
This information is given in the question, so no calculation is needed.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of hours Kris plays in 3 weeks.
Total hours in 2 weeks = 14.7 hours
Total hours in 1 week at 2 hours/day = 14 hours
Total hours in 1 week at 2 hours/day (extra) = (given in the question)
Total hours in 3 weeks = 3 * (14.7 + 14 + [given number of hours])

Step 5: Calculate how many hours more Kris needs to play to earn the achievement.
Total hours needed for the achievement = 30 hours
Total hours Kris has played = 14.7 * 2 + 14 + [given number of hours]
Hours more needed = Total hours needed - Total hours played = 30 - (14.7 * 2 + 14 + [given number of hours])

{The final answer is: The number of hours Kris still needs to play is 30 - (29.4 + 14 + [given number of hours]).}

Note: The given number of hours Kris plays every day for a week is missing in the question. Therefore, the final answer contains a variable [given number of hours] that must be provided to calculate the exact number of hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement.</s>","Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.
So playing for half an hour every day means Kris will have played for 0.5 hours * 14 days = <<0.5*14=7>>7 hours.
Playing for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.

- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.

Step 2: Find the distance travelled by each car in one hour:
- First car: 60 miles/hour
- Second car: 70 miles/hour

Step 3: Calculate the difference in distance travelled by the two cars in one hour:
- Distance difference = Second car's speed - First car's speed
- Distance difference = 70 miles/hour - 60 miles/hour = 10 miles/hour

Step 4: Find the distance travelled by each car in one hour:
- First car: 60 miles
- Second car: 70 miles

Step 5: Find the total distance between the two cars after one hour:
- Total distance = Distance travelled by first car + Distance difference
- Total distance = 60 miles + 10 miles = 70 miles

Step 6: Since both cars continue at the same speed, we can calculate the distance between them after 2 hours:
- Distance between the cars after 2 hours = Total distance after 1 hour * 2
- Distance between the cars after 2 hours = 70 miles * 2 = 140 miles

{The final answer is: 140 miles}</s>","In two hours, the first car will have traveled 60*2 = <<60*2=120>>120 miles.
Similarly, the second car will have traveled 70*2 = <<70*2=140>>140 miles.

- James bought a ring for his bride-to-be.
- The diamond in the ring cost $600.
- The gold in the ring cost $300.
- James paid a 30% premium for the ring to be made.

Step 2: Find the cost of the gold and diamond before the premium was added.
Since we are given the cost of the gold and diamond separately, we don't need to calculate this step.

The cost of gold: $300
The cost of diamond: $600

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the gold and diamond after the premium.
To calculate the cost after the premium, we need to find 30% of the total cost before the premium and then add it to that cost.

First, let's find the total cost before the premium:
Total cost before premium = Cost of diamond + Cost of gold
Total cost before premium = $600 + $300
Total cost before premium = $900

Next, we need to find the amount of the premium:
Premium = 30% of Total cost before premium
Premium = 0.3 * $900
Premium = $270

Now, we can calculate the total cost after the premium:
Total cost after premium = Total cost before premium + Premium
Total cost after premium = $900 + $270
Total cost after premium = $1170

Step 4: Find the final answer.

{The final answer is} James paid $1170 for the ring.</s>","The material cost 600+300=$<<600+300=900>>900

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the pass rates for third, fourth, and fifth graders.
- Third graders: 340 passed out of 500, so the pass rate is 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%.
- Fourth graders: 40 passed out of 100, so the pass rate is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.
- Fifth graders: Their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it is 2 * 40% = 80%.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of students in the school.
- We know there are 500 third-graders, 100 fourth-graders, and 400 fifth-graders, so the total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

Step 3: Find the total number of students who passed the test.
- We know that 340 third-graders and 40 fourth-graders passed, and 400 fifth-graders passed, so the total number of students who passed is 340 + 40 + 400 = 780.

Step 4: Calculate the overall pass rate.
- The overall pass rate is the ratio of students who passed to the total number of students, so it is 780/1000 = 0.78 or 78%.

{The final answer is: The school's overall pass rate is 78%.}</s>","First find the pass rate for the fourth graders: 40 students / 100 students = <<40/100=.4>>.4
Then double that to find the pass rate for the fifth graders: .4 * 2 = <<.4*2=.8>>.8
Then multiply the fifth graders' pass rate by the number of fifth graders to find the total number of fifth graders who passed: .8 * 400 fifth graders = <<.8*400=320>>320 fifth graders
Now add up the number of passing students from each grade to find to find the total number of passing students: 320 students + 40 students + 340 students = <<320+40+340=700>>700 students
Add up the total number of students in each grade to find the total number of students: 400 students + 100 students + 500 students = <<400+100+500=1000>>1000 students
Finally, divide the number of passing students by the total number of students and multiply by 100% to find the total number who passed: 700 students / 1000 students * 100% = 70%

                 [/INST] Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. We know that it takes 12 glass chips to make one square inch of the mosaic.
2. Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. So, the area of his mosaic is 3 inches x 3 inches = 9 square inches.
3. Each bag contains 72 glass chips. Milo has two bags, so he has 2 x 72 = 144 glass chips.
4. The number of square inches of mosaic that Milo can make is the number of chips he has divided by the number of chips per square inch.
5. Therefore, Milo can make 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 inches^2 = 12 x 12 = 144 square inches of mosaic.
6. Since we're only concerned with the length, we can find it by taking the square root of the area: sqrt(144) = 12 inches.

{The final answer is 12 inches}.</s>","Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.
With those, he can make 144 / 12 = <<144/12=12>>12 square inches of mosaic.
Thus, Milo can make his 3 inch tall mosaic 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.

                 [/INST] To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we first need to find out how many quarts of tea were consumed and then convert that amount to gallons.

1. First, let's find out how many quarts of tea were consumed by the given number of students.
   - Four students each drank 1.5 quarts, so a total of 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts were consumed by the first group.
   - 16 students each drank 2 quarts, so a total of 16 x 2 = 32 quarts were consumed by the second group.
   - Therefore, a total of 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts were consumed by all students.

2. Now, let's convert 38 quarts to gallons, as there are 4 quarts in one gallon.
   - 38 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 9.5 gallons

3. Since we cannot have a fraction of a gallon, we will need to round up to the next full gallon. Hence, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 10 quarts + 9.5 gallons = 11 gallons (or 11.25 gallons if we round up and consider the initial 10 quarts).

So, the final answer is: {There were 11 gallons (or 11.25 gallons) of tea at the beginning of the party.}</s>","4 students drank 1.5 quarts = 4 * 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6 quarts
16 students drank 2 quarts = 16 * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 quarts

Students + tea left = 38 + 10 quarts = <<38+10=48>>48 quarts
48 quarts = 12 gallons
The party started with 12 gallons of tea.

Step 5: The question states that Dale wanted to sell all of his candies for his club at school. Since he currently has 350 candies, and we don't know how many candies he has already sold, we cannot determine exactly how many more candies Dale needs to sell to reach that goal.

Step 1: We know that the number of students doubles every month, so we can represent the number of students at the end of each month using the formula:

Number of students in month n = Number of students in month n-1 × 2

Step 2: Since there are 10 students at the beginning of the year, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:

Month 1 (April): 10 × 2 = 20 students
Month 2 (May): 20 × 2 = 40 students

Step 3: We are interested in the number of additional students above and beyond the initial number of students at the beginning of the year by the end of May. To find that, we can subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

Additional students = Number of students at end of May - Number of students at beginning of year

1. First, let's calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed in a week. We know that he made $105 during the week and that each branch costs $0.25 to climb.
2. To find the total number of branches, we divide the total earnings by the cost per branch.
   Total branches = Total earnings / Cost per branch
   Total branches = $105 / $0.25
   Total branches = 420

3. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can now find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day.
   Average branches per day = Total branches / Number of days
   Average branches per day = 420 / 7
   Average branches per day = 60

- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Step 2: Subtract the number of petals lost due to the dropped flowers and the flowers blown away by the wind.
- Each dropped flower: Unknown, let's assume one flower was dropped from each type to maintain symmetry.
- Petals from the dropped flowers: 1 (from each type) * (5, 6, 4, 7) = 15 petals
- Petals blown away by the wind: Also 1 (from each type) * (5, 6, 4, 7) = 15 petals
- Total petals lost: 30 petals

Step 3: Subtract the lost petals from the total number of petals.
- Total number of petals before losing some: (15 + 24 + 20 + 42) = 81 petals
- Total number of petals in the vase after losing some: 81 - 30 = 51 petals

{The final answer is 51 petals in the vase.}</s>","Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.

- Each S'more uses one marshmallow.
- John makes 9 S'mores.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores.

So, John uses 9 marshmallows and DeSean uses 9 marshmallows. Therefore, a total of 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows are used.

Step 2: Subtract the used marshmallows from the total number of marshmallows in the bag to find the remaining marshmallows.
- 35 marshmallows were in the bag initially.
- 18 marshmallows were used.

Remaining marshmallows = 35 (initial marshmallows) - 18 (used marshmallows) = 17 marshmallows

Step 3: Divide the remaining marshmallows equally between John and DeSean to find the number of S'mores each can make.

Since there are now 17 marshmallows and each S'more requires one marshmallow, each kid can make 17 S'mores. However, since they both have made 9 S'mores each earlier, they have already made a total of 18 S'mores. The remaining marshmallows represent the S'mores they can make from now on. Therefore, each kid can make an additional 17 - 18/2 = 16.5 S'mores, which is not possible since each S'more requires one whole marshmallow. In reality, there might have been an error in the calculation or the initial number of marshmallows in the bag.

We have:

1. Jack plays for 4 hours, which is equal to N * 20 minutes per game. So N = (4 hours) / (20 minutes/game) = 8 games.
2. Two friends play half as long as Jack, so they play for 8 games * (1/2) = 4 games each.
3. One friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 8 games * 1.5 = 12 games.

Now let's calculate the cost of each friend's gameplay:

1. Jack pays $0.25 per game.
2. Two average friends pay $0.25 * 0.5 = $0.125 per game.
3. The better friend pays $0.25 * 1.5 = $0.375 per game.

Now let's calculate their total expenses:

1. Jack spends 8 games * $0.25 = $2.00.
2. Two average friends spend 4 games each * $0.125 = $0.50 each, so they spend 4 games * $0.50 = $2.00 in total.
3. The better friend spends 12 games * $0.375 = $4.50.

So the final answer is: {Jack and his friends spend a total of $6.50 on games at the arcade}.</s>","Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour

1. We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. Since she uses salt and sugar in equal amounts, and she uses enough to fill a 10-ounce jar, each of those ingredients must be 5 ounces (since 10 ounces divided by 2 equals 5 ounces).

2. We're also told that she uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. So let's find out how much oil she uses in relation to the amounts of salt and zest:

- She uses twice as much salt as zest, so if salt is 5 ounces, then zest is 5 ounces / 2 = 2.5 ounces.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt, so if salt is 5 ounces, then oil is 5 ounces * 2 = 10 ounces.

3. Therefore, Tanya uses 10 ounces of oil to make enough scrub to fill a 10-ounce jar.

{The final answer is: Tanya uses 10 ounces of oil.}</s>","Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.
Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.
She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.
In all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.
Thus, she uses Z = 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1 ounce of zest.

1. Paul has 8 chocolate cupcakes.
2. Paul has 40 toffee cupcakes.

Let's calculate how many cupcakes Paul has in total:

Paul's total number of cupcakes = Paul's chocolate cupcakes + Paul's toffee cupcakes
Total = 8 + 40
Total = 48

Now, let's calculate how many more cupcakes Paul needs:

Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total for the birthday party.
Paul currently has 48 cupcakes.

Thus, Paul needs to buy:

Paul's needed cupcakes - Paul's current cupcakes
63 - 48

1. We know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. If Robert has 20 cars, then Joe has 20 cars × 2 = 40 cars.
2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. So, he sells 40 cars × 20% = 8 cars.
3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sells to his mother. Since he sells 8 cars, he gives away 8 cars × 2 = 16 cars.
4. After selling and giving away cars, Joe remains with 40 cars (his total number of cars) - 8 cars (sold) - 16 cars (given away) = 16 cars.

Step 2: Subtract $50,000 from $175,000.

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

So, the students raised a total of $125,000.

Step 3: Divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 / 20 students = $6,250 per student

Step 2: Find the time Sandy spent walking on the first day.
Sandy spent 8 hours walking on the first day.

Step 3: Find the time Sandy spent walking on the second day.
She walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. So, she spent 8 hours / 2 = 4 hours on the second day.

Step 4: Calculate the total time Sandy spent walking in both days.
Total time = Time on first day + Time on second day = 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.

We know that the total number of Magic Cards among Becca, Smendrick, and PJ is 341. Since Becca has 12 more Magic Cards than Smendrick and Smendrick has 3P cards, then Becca's number of Magic Cards is S + 12 + 3P.

Next, let's calculate the shipping cost based on weight: (Shipping cost = $0.35 per pound * Number of pounds)

Shipping cost = $0.35/pound * 4 pounds
Shipping cost = $1.40

Next, let's calculate the shipping cost based on distance: (Shipping cost = $0.08 per mile * Number of miles)

Number of miles = distance to distribution center
Number of miles = 20 miles

Shipping cost = $0.08/mile * 20 miles
Shipping cost = $1.60

Total cost = Cost of book + Shipping cost
Total cost = $32 + $1.40 + $1.60
Total cost = $34.00

Lastly, let's calculate the refund amount:

Refund amount = (75% of book cost)
Refund amount = 0.75 * $32
Refund amount = $24.32

Since Milly will lose the difference between the total cost and the refund amount:

Milly's loss = Total cost - Refund amount
Milly's loss = $34.00 - $24.32

1.First week: Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

2.Second week: He produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

3.Third week: He produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, we don't have enough information to determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week. The problem states that Boris produces a different amount each week, but it doesn't specify how the amount produced in the fourth week relates to the amounts produced in the first three weeks. Therefore, it's impossible to calculate the production amount in the fourth week with the given information.

The base price for installing 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00. Each mirror, shelf, and picture added costs an additional $15.00.

2. Let's calculate the cost for installing 6 mirrors (instead of the given 4) and 20 pictures (instead of the given 10). The cost for installing 6 mirrors will be 6 * $15 = $90. The cost for installing 20 pictures will be 20 * $15 = $300.

3. The cost for installing 1 chandelier is already included in the base price of $129.00.

1. We know that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Eva has saved $10.00. {Eva has saved $10.}
2. We also know that Roy has saved 40% more money than Anthony. Let's call the amount of money Anthony has ""A"". Then, Roy has saved 1.4 times as much as Anthony, so Roy has saved $1.4A.
3. We're told that $10.00 is a 40% increase from the amount that Anthony has saved. So, we can set up the equation:
   $1.4A = A + $10
4. Subtract A from both sides of the equation:
   $0.4A = $10
5. Divide both sides of the equation by 0.4 to find the value of A:
   A = $10 / 0.4 = $25

1. Naruto can lift a mountain 10x his limit.
2. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4x his limit.
3. Sakura can lift a mountain 12x her limit.
4. Pompei can lift a mountain 1inch.

Now, let's find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain:
Naruto lifts a mountain 10x his limit, so the height of the mountain he can lift is 10 times the limit of his ability. To convert the limit to feet, we need to know what the limit is in inches since the given Pompei's limit is in inches. Let's assume for now that the limit of Naruto's ability is equal to Pompei's limit of 1 inch.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 inches, but since we want to know the height in feet, we multiply by 12 to convert inches to feet (1 foot = 12 inches).

Naruto can lift a mountain: 10 inches * 12 feet/inch = <<10*12=120>>120 feet

We still need to determine the actual limit of Naruto's ability in inches to find the exact height. However, based on the given information alone, we can't determine the limit in inches for any of the characters mentioned. Further information is needed to calculate that.

{The final answer is: Naruto can lift a mountain 120 feet high, but the exact height of his ability limit is unknown.}</s>","If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.
Since Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4*1=<<4*1=4>>4 feet.
And since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami. then Naruto can lift a mountain 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 feet.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's calculate how many miles Mason traveled during the first leg of his journey, which lasted for 4 hours:
Mason's traveling speed = 8 miles per hour
Number of hours traveled first = 4

Miles traveled during the first leg = Speed * Hours
Miles traveled during the first leg = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours
Miles traveled during the first leg = 32 miles

Step 2: Next, let's calculate how many miles he traveled during the second leg of his journey, which also lasted for 6 hours:

Miles traveled during the second leg = Speed * Hours
Miles traveled during the second leg = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours
Miles traveled during the second leg = 48 miles

Step 3: To find out the total number of miles Mason traveled, add the miles traveled during both legs:

Total miles traveled = Miles traveled during first leg + Miles traveled during second leg
Total miles traveled = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total miles traveled = 80 miles

{The final answer is: Mason traveled a total of 80 miles.}</s>","If Mason travels for 8 miles in one hour, in four hours, he traveled for 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 miles.
After his rest, Mason traveled for another 6 hours, and since he was traveling at 8 miles per hour, he had traveled for 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 miles after the six hours.
For the whole journey, Mason traveled for 32+48 = <<32+48=80>>80 miles.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway, we first need to find out the speed of a single kangaroo. Then we can find the time it takes for the turtles to cross.

Given:
1. A kangaroo group takes 18 hours to cross the highway.
2. The number of kangaroos is 3.

Step 1: Find the speed of a single kangaroo.
The speed of a single kangaroo can be found by dividing the total time it takes for all three kangaroos to cross by the number of kangaroos:
Speed of a single kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of a single kangaroo = 18 hours / 3
Speed of a single kangaroo = 6 hours per kangaroo

Step 2: Find the time it takes for four turtles to cross.
First, find the speed of a single turtle, which is half the speed of a single kangaroo:
Speed of a single turtle = Speed of a single kangaroo / 2
Speed of a single turtle = 6 hours per kangaroo / 2
Speed of a single turtle = 3 hours per turtle

Now we can find the time it takes for all four turtles to cross:
Time for all turtles = Total distance / Speed of a single turtle
Since the problem doesn't provide the total distance of the highway, we can't give a numerical answer. However, we know that the time for the turtles is greater than the time for the kangaroos.

{The final answer is: The time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is more than 18 hours}.</s>","If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed, a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, one kangaroo takes 18/3= <<18/3=6>>6 hours to cross the highway.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We know that Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so if Rory makes x dishes, then Jada makes 2x dishes.
2. We also know that Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so if Kora makes y dishes, then Rory makes y+20 dishes.
3. To find out how many dishes they all make together, we need to add the number of dishes made by each of them.
4. Substitute y for the number of dishes Kora makes in the equations for Jada and Rory and solve for x.
5. Finally, we can find out how many dishes they all make together by adding the number of dishes made by each of them.

Let's go through each step in detail:

Step 1: Find the number of dishes Jada makes
Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so if Rory makes x dishes, then Jada makes 2x dishes.

Step 2: Find the number of dishes Rory makes
Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora. If Kora makes y dishes, then Rory makes y+20 dishes.

Step 3: Find the number of dishes they all make together
To find out how many dishes they all make together, we need to add the number of dishes made by each of them.

Step 4: Solve for x, the number of dishes Rory makes
We have two equations for Jada and Rory. We can solve for x by setting them equal to each other:

2x = y + 20 (Jada's equation)
x = y + 10 (Rory's equation)

Subtracting y from both sides of the second equation and then subtracting 10 from the result, we get x = y + 10.

Now substitute this expression for x in the first equation:

2(y + 10) = y + 20

Solving for y:

2y + 20 = y + 20 + 20
2y + 20 = 3y + 20
y = 10

Substituting y back into the equations for Jada and Rory, we have:

Jada makes 2x = 2(y + 10) = 2(10 + 10) = 40 dishes
Rory makes x = 10 dishes

Step 5: Add the number of dishes they all make together
They make 40 (Jada's dishes) + 10 (Rory's dishes) = 50 clay dishes together.

{The final answer is: They make 50 clay dishes together.}</s>","If Kora made 20 clay dishes, Rory made 20 clay dishes + 20 clay dishes = <<20+20=40>>40 clay dishes.
Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory, which totals 2 * 40 clay dishes = <<2*40=80>>80 clay dishes.
The total number of clay dishes made by the three is 80 from Jada + 40 from Rory + 20 from Kora = <<80+40+20=140>>140 clay dishes

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how much Erika needs in total to buy the new laptop. The new laptop costs $600, and if she trades in her old laptop, she gets a $200 discount. So the total amount Erika needs is:

$600 (new laptop cost) - $200 (trade-in discount) = $400

Next, let's find out how much money Erika currently has. She has some savings in her purse and she got paid $150 this week. Her mom agrees to give her $80 as well. So, the total amount of money Erika has is:

$ (her savings in purse) + $150 (money she was paid this week) + $80 (money her mom is giving her)

To find out how much Erika's savings are in her purse, we need to determine if she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop or not. If she does, we'll know her savings are less than $50. However, the problem states that she only needs an extra $50, so we know her savings in her purse are greater than $50. Therefore, we don't need to find out the exact amount.

{The final answer is: Erika has more than $500 in her purse}.</s>","Selling the old laptop reduced the cost of the new laptop to $600 – $200 = $<<600-200=400>>400 dollars.
We know she doesn't have all the money yet, so she actually has $400 – $50 = $<<400-50=350>>350 dollars.
Some of this money came from her mom, so the money she had herself was $350 – $80 = $<<350-80=270>>270.

3. In total, Adam eats 15 slices from 3 large apples and 5 small apples.
4. To find out how many apple slices are left, we need to find out how many slices were made in total.
5. The number of slices from the large apples is 15, and the number of slices from the small apples is also 15.
6. So in total, Adam made 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.
7. Since Adam ate 15 slices, there are 30 (Total slices made) - 15 (Slices eaten) = 15 apple slices left.

Current milk production of one cow = 5 liters/day

Step 2: Find out how many liters of milk are produced by the farmer's 3 cows collectively.
Milk production of 3 cows = Milk production of one cow * Number of cows
Milk production of 3 cows = 5 liters/day * 3
Milk production of 3 cows = 15 liters/day

Step 3: Determine how many more liters of milk the farmer needs to produce daily to have a total of 25 liters.
Additional milk needed per day = 25 liters - Current milk production (from 3 cows)
Additional milk needed per day = 25 liters - 15 liters
Additional milk needed per day = 10 liters

Step 4: Divide the additional milk needed each day by the milk production of one cow to find out how many more cows the farmer needs.
Number of additional cows needed = Additional milk needed per day / Milk production of one cow

1. Find the length of each partially used stick:
   a. The first stick has 1/6 left, so the used portion is 5/6.
      Length of the used portion = 5/6 * Original length
      Length of the used portion = 5/6 * 12 mm
      Length of the used portion = 7.5 mm

   b. The second stick has 2/3 left, so the used portion is 1/3.
      Length of the used portion = 1/3 * Original length
      Length of the used portion = 1/3 * 12 mm
      Length of the used portion = 4 mm

   c. The third stick has 1/2 left, so the used portion is 1/2.
      Length of the used portion = 1/2 * Original length
      Length of the used portion = 1/2 * 12 mm
      Length of the used portion = 6 mm

2. Find the length of the unused portions:
   a. The length of the unused portion of the first stick = Original length - used portion
      Length of the unused portion = 12 mm - 7.5 mm
      Length of the unused portion = 4.5 mm

   b. The length of the unused portion of the second stick = Original length - used portion
      Length of the unused portion = 12 mm - 4 mm
      Length of the unused portion = 8 mm

   c. The length of the unused portion of the third stick = Original length - used portion
      Length of the unused portion = 12 mm - 6 mm
      Length of the unused portion = 6 mm

3. Find the total length of the unused glue sticks:
   Total length of the unused sticks = Length of the unused portion of the first stick + Length of the unused portion of the second stick + Length of the unused portion of the third stick
   Total length of the unused sticks = 4.5 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm
   Total length of the unused sticks = 18.5 mm

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends, and his brother gave him an additional $200, so Gabriel has a total of:

$5000 + $200 = $5020

Step 2: Determine how much Gabriel has spent in total.
Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800, so in total, he has spent:

$10000 (for the car) + $800 (for the phone) = $10800

Step 3: Determine how much money Gabriel still needs.
Gabriel has spent a total of $10800, but he only has $5020, so he still needs:

$10800 (total spending) - $5020 (current savings) = $5778

1. Peter has socks as Jack has.
2. Jack has dishes, and Peter has socks.
3. Jack has dishes in the store, which is twice the number of socks he has.
4. If Jack had 60 dishes, we need to find the total number of socks and dishes they both have.

II. Let's express the relationship between the number of socks Peter has and the number of socks Jack has:
SocksPeter = SocksJack

III. Next, we know that Jack has dishes and Peter has socks, with the relationship being:

dishesJack = 2 * socksJack

IV. Since SocksPeter = SocksJack, we can write the equation involving the number of socks:

SocksPeter = SocksJack

V. From Step 3, we know that dishesJack = 2 * SocksJack. We are given that dishesJack = 60, so:

2 * SocksJack = 60

VI. Solve for SocksJack:
SocksJack = 60 / 2 = 30

VII. Now we have the number of socks Jack has, so we can find the number of socks Peter has:
SocksPeter = SocksJack = 30

VIII. Since we have the number of socks for both Peter and Jack, we can find the total number of dishes they both have:
dishesJack = 2 * SocksJack = 2 * 30 = 60
dishesPeter = Not given

IX. To find the total number of dishes and socks they both have, we just need to add their collections:
TotalSocks = SocksPeter + SocksJack = 30 + 30 = 60
TotalDishes = dishesJack + dishesPeter = 60 + 60 = 120

{The final answer is: Peter and Jack have a total of 60 socks and 120 dishes.}</s>","Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, he has 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 socks.

2. Five of them are good at math only.
3. Eight of them perform well in English only.
4. The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, let's find out how many students are good at both math and English. We know that there are 5 students who are good at math only and 8 students who are good at English only. Therefore, the number of students who are good at both math and English is:

Total students - Students good at math only - Students good at English only

1. The duration of the entire concert, including the intermission, is 2 hours.
2. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes.
3. The total time allotted for each group, including getting on and off stage, is 10 minutes.
4. During the performance itself, each group is given 6 minutes.

First, we need to find out how many minutes are available for actual performances. We know that there is a 10-minute intermission. So, the total time for the performances is 120 minutes (2 hours) minus 10 minutes (intermission) = 110 minutes.

Now, we'll determine how many minutes are allocated to each group for a performance. Each group gets 6 minutes for their performance, so we'll calculate how many groups can fit into the 110 minutes.

To determine the number of groups, we divide the total time available for performances by the time allotted for each group's performance. {The final answer is 110 minutes (total time) ÷ 6 minutes/group = 18.3333 groups}. However, since it's not possible to have a fraction of a group, Vicki can only accommodate 18 groups in the concert.</s>","First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
Of those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 – 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances.
Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.
Of the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.

Step 3: He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold 2 * 10 = <ins>20</ins> goats from Farm Y.

Step 4: So there are now 45 - 20 = <ins>25</ins> goats in Farm Y.

                 [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes per month.
2. In one year, there are 12 months, so James buys 2 pairs x 12 months = 24 pairs of shoes in a year.
3. We're told that James spends $2640 on shoes each year.
4. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount he spends on shoes in a year by the number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year.

Average cost per pair = Total yearly cost / Number of pairs per year

1. The cost of one basket of green food is $25.
2. The cost of one basket of red food is $18.

Given a discount of $2 per basket for red food, the actual cost of buying one basket of red food is:
$18 - $2 = $16.

Now, we are purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, so:

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is: 3 * $25 = $75.
The cost of 3 baskets of red food is: 3 * $16 = $48.

Therefore, the total cost of buying 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food with the given discount is:
$75 (for green) + $48 (for red) = $123.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes it takes to clean all the rooms.
Minutes to clean one room = 20 minutes
Number of rooms = 90

Total minutes to clean all rooms = Minutes to clean one room * Number of rooms
Total minutes = 20 minutes/room * 90 rooms
Total minutes = 1800 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the number of hours for cleaning all the rooms.
Hours = Total minutes / 60 minutes/hour
Hours = 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour
Hours = 30 hours

Step 3: Determine the number of rooms to be cleaned in half an hour.
Minutes in half an hour = 30 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the number of rooms that can be cleaned in half an hour.
Rooms cleaned in half an hour = Minutes in half an hour / Minutes to clean one room
Rooms cleaned in half an hour = 30 minutes / 20 minutes/room
Rooms cleaned in half an hour = 1.5 rooms

Since we cannot clean half a room, we'll round up to the nearest whole number and clean 2 rooms in half an hour.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of rooms that can be cleaned in an hour.
Rooms cleaned in an hour = Rooms cleaned in half an hour * 2
Rooms cleaned in an hour = 2 rooms * 2
Rooms cleaned in an hour = 4 rooms

Step 6: Calculate the number of hours it takes to clean half of the rooms.
Number of rooms = 90
Rooms to be cleaned = 90 * 0.5 = 45 rooms
Hours to clean half the rooms = Number of rooms to be cleaned / Rooms cleaned in an hour
Hours to clean half the rooms = 45 rooms / 4 rooms/hour
Hours to clean half the rooms = 11.25 hours

Since housekeeping can't work for a quarter of an hour, they would have to clean an additional half an hour (20 minutes) worth of rooms to complete the tasks. Thus, the final answer is:

{The final answer is: It would take approximately 12 hours and 12 minutes to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.}</s>","90 * 20 = <<90*20=1800>>1800 minutes

                 [/INST] Let's denote the age of the brother as X, the age of the sister as Y, and the age of the person asking the question (you) as Z.

From the problem, we have the following relations:

1. Z = X - 3 (You are three years younger than your brother)
2. Z = Y + 2 (You are two years older than your sister)
3. X + Y + Z = 87 (The sum of all the ages is 87)

Now, we can solve these equations step by step to find the value of Z (Your age).

First, let's isolate X and Y from the first two equations:

X = Z + 3
Y = Z - 2

Now, substitute X and Y from these equations into the third equation:

(Z + 3) + (Z - 2) + Z = 87

Perform the addition inside the parenthesis:

3Z + 1 = 87

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3Z = 86

Divide by 3:

Z = 28.67 (Approximately)

Since ages are measured in whole numbers, Z cannot be a decimal value. We need to check if there is any possible combination of whole numbers for X, Y, and Z that satisfy the conditions given in the problem.

The first condition (Z = X - 3) and second condition (Z = Y + 2) imply that X = Z + 3 and Y = Z - 2.

Let's try Z = 29 (the smallest possible integer value that results in a whole number when Z is subtracted by 3 or added by 2 for X and Y, respectively).

With this value, X = 29 + 3 = 32, and Y = 29 - 2 = 27. However, this combination doesn't satisfy the third condition (the sum of all the ages being 87).

There's no solution possible with whole numbers for X, Y, and Z based on the given conditions from the problem.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the question. The issue here appears to be that either the information provided in the problem is not accurate or there's a missing piece of information required to find a valid solution.

The final answer is: I cannot determine my age using the given information.</s>","Let X be my age. My brother is X + 3 years old. My sister is X - 2 years old.
My mom is (X + 3) * 3 - 1 years old.
The sum of our ages is X + (X+3) + (X-2) + [(X+3)*3 - 1] = 87 years old.
Multiplying through the parentheses and combining like terms, you get X*6 + 9 = 87 years old.
Subtracting nine from both sides and dividing both sides by 6, you get X = 13 years old.

Step 4: Determine how many glue sticks come in one pack.
Each pack contains 8 glue sticks.

Step 5: Calculate how many packs of glue sticks are needed to provide each student with 2 sticks, assuming no extra sticks will be left over.

Each infected person infects six others. So, the number of new infections from one infected person is 6.

Step 2: Find the total number of new infections after one day.
The initial number of infected people is 10. Each of these 10 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections in a day is:

New infections in 1 day = Number of infected people * Infections per infected person
New infections in 1 day = 10 * 6
New infections in 1 day = 60

Step 3: Find the total number of infected people after two days.
After one day, there are 10 + 60 = 70 infected people. Each of these 70 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections in a day is:

New infections in 2nd day = 70 * 6
New infections in 2nd day = 420

The total number of infected people after two days is:

First, let's find out how much tip Rafaela received from each customer:
1. Number of customers: 40
2. Tip amount per customer: $20

So, Rafaela received tips from 40 customers, each tip being $20, resulting in a total of $800 for Rafaela (40 x $20).
The final answer for Rafaela's tips: {$800}.

Now, to find Julieta's tips, we know that she received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To calculate Julieta's tips, we need to find the difference between the amount Rafaela earned and 10% less of that amount for Julieta.

First, let's check the tips Rafaela received ($800):

Next, let's calculate the tips Julieta received:
1. Tip difference between Rafaela and Julieta: 10% of Rafaela's tips
2. Tip difference percentage: 10%

To calculate the difference between Rafaela's tips and Julieta's tips, we multiply Rafaela's tips by 10%, finding the difference:

$800 x 0.1 = $80

Then, to find Julieta's total tips, we subtract the difference from Rafaela's tips:

$800 - $80 = $720

The final answer for Julieta's tips: {$720}.

To find the total tips both Rafaela and Julieta received, we add their individual tip amounts:

Total Tips = Rafaela's Tips + Julieta's Tips

1. Claire earns one girl scout badge every month.
2. Amber earns badges twice as fast as Claire, so Amber earns badges every month.
3. Wendy earns three times the number of badges as Claire in the same time frame.

Let's find out how many badges Claire earns in one year:

1. Claire earns one badge every month. So, in one year (12 months), Claire will earn badges.

Now let's find out how many badges Amber earns in one year:

1. Amber earns badges every month. So, in one year (12 months), Amber will earn badges.

Finally, let's find out how many badges Wendy earns in one year:

1. Wendy earns three times the number of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Claire earns badges in one year, so Wendy will earn badges in one year.

The final answer is: Wendy earns badges more than Amber in a 1-year time frame.</s>","Claire earns 1 badge every month so over 12 months she earns 1*12 = <<1*12=12>>12 badges
It takes Amber twice as long as Claire to earn a badge so over 1 year she earns 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 badges
Wendy earns 3 times the amount of badges compared to Claire who earns 12 badges so over 1 year Wendy earns 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 badges
Wendy earns 36 badges while Amber earns 6 so Wendy has earned 36-6 = <<36-6=30>>30 more badges

- She can bake 2 loaves per hour.

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices she can get from one loaf.
- Each loaf is cut into 8 slices.

Step 3: Find out how many slices she can sell in total during the baking period.
- She bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a duration of 5 hours (360 minutes).
- In one hour, she can sell 2 * 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 loaves.
- So in 5 hours, she can sell 16 * 5 = <<16*5=80>>80 loaves.
- Since each loaf is cut into 8 slices, in total, she can sell 80 * 8 = <<80*8=640>>640 slices.

Step 4: Calculate the revenue from selling all the slices.
- Each slice is sold for 50 cents or 0.5 dollars.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of silver coins that Gretchen has as S. according to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so the number of gold coins that Gretchen has is S + 30. Now, we are given that if Gretchen had 70 more gold coins, she would have had a total of 100 gold coins. So, the number of gold coins she has now is S + 30, and the number of gold coins she would have had is S + 30 + 70 = S + 100. Setting up an equation, we have:

S + 30 = gold coins now
S + 100 = gold coins if she had 70 more

We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so to find the total number of coins that Gretchen has, we can find the difference between the number of gold coins and silver coins in both scenarios:

Total coins (if she has 70 more gold coins) = gold coins (if she had 70 more) + silver coins
Total coins = (S + 100) + S = 2S + 100

Total coins (now) = gold coins (now) + silver coins
Total coins = (S + 30) + S = 2S + 30

To find the difference between these two values, we can subtract the equation for the total coins (now) from the equation for the total coins (if she had 70 more gold coins):

(2S + 100) - (2S + 30) = 100 - 30
70 = 70

The equation above indicates that the difference between the two values is equal to 70. Since the difference is 70, it must be the number of silver coins that Gretchen has. Therefore, we can find the total number of coins that Gretchen has by adding the number of silver coins to the number of gold coins, and using the total number of gold coins from the scenario where Gretchen had 70 more gold coins:

Total coins = gold coins (with 70 more) + silver coins
Total coins = (S + 100) + 70
Total coins = (S + 30) + 70 + S
Total coins = 2S + 100 + 70
Total coins = 2S + 170

Since we found that Gretchen has 70 silver coins, we can substitute that value into the equation:

Total coins = 2(70) + 170
Total coins = 140 + 170
Total coins = 310

{The final answer is 310}.</s>","Gretchen has 70-30=<<70-30=40>>40 silver coins.

50 students * 10 burritos per student = 500 burritos

Step 3: Determine the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Step 4: Calculate the number of burritos consumed by Mr. George.
500 burritos (given to students) + 20 burritos (eaten by Mr. George) = 520 burritos

Step 5: Subtract the number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos.

4. The total number of cars is 12 (red) + 14 (green) + 42 (blue) + X (yellow), where X is the number of yellow cars.
5. We're told that there are 75 cars in total, so we can set up the equation: 12 + 14 + 42 + X = 75

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's represent the number of books each person has with variables. Let's say Sofie has S books, Anne has A books, and Fawn has F books.

Step 2: From the problem, we know that together they have 85 books. So, S + A + F = 85

Step 3: We are also told that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so S = A + 25

Step 4: And we are told that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so A = F - 12

Step 5: We have three equations with three variables: S + A + F = 85, S = A + 25, A = F - 12

Step 6: To solve this system of equations, we can first find A in terms of F using A = F - 12. Then, we can find S in terms of F using S = A + 25. Substitute A in terms of F into the first equation to get F equations in one variable: F + (F - 12) + F = 85

Step 7: Simplify the equation: 3F = 85, F = 28.333... (This is not an integer solution, which contradicts having a whole number of books. It's likely there's a mistake in the problem.)

- She bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes.
- She also bought a bag of carrots that weighed 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes.

Step 2: Find the weight of the sweet potatoes.
We know that the weight of the potatoes was 5 pounds and the weight of the sweet potatoes was 2 times as much.
- Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * Weight of potatoes
- Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * 5 pounds
- Weight of sweet potatoes = 10 pounds

Given that the seller bought 5 phones, each costing $700, the total amount spent on buying the phones is:

Total amount spent on buying phones = Number of phones * Cost per phone
= 5 * $700
= $3500

The seller received $4000 in sales. So, the total amount of money the seller has is:

Total amount of money the seller has = Total amount spent on buying phones + Sales amount
= $3500 + $4000
= $7500

The seller has given out $4000 in sales, so the amount of money still with the seller is:

Amount of money with the seller = Total amount of money the seller has - Sales amount
= $7500 - $4000
= $3500

Thus, the final answer is that the seller has $3500 left and we don't have information on how much change the seller will give back if they receive additional sales. Therefore, the question is not fully answered as it stands.

Step 2: It is given that Madeline pays 60% of the total cost. Therefore, Keenan must pay the remaining 40%, which is calculated as follows:

Cost paid by Madeline = $400 * 0.6 = $240
Cost paid by Keenan = $400 * 0.4 = $160

Step 3: We want to find out how much Keenan spends per week, so we first need to find out his total expenses in a month. We already know that he pays $160 per month.

Step 4: A month has 4 weeks, so we can divide Madeline and Keenan's monthly expenses by 4 to find out their individual weekly expenses:

Weekly cost for Madeline = $240 / 4 = $60 per week
Weekly cost for Keenan = $160 / 4 = $40 per week

First, let's find out how many pieces Tobias consumed on the first day:

1 pizza = 60 pieces
1 day = 2/5 * 60

{Calculation: 1 day = (2/5)*60 = 72 pieces}

Next, let's calculate how many pieces he ate on the second day:

1 day = 10 pieces

Now let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. We know Tobias ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces on the third day, so we need to find how many pieces were left after he ate 2/5 on the first day and 10 on the second day:

Initial amount = 60 pieces
Pieces eaten on day 1 = 72 pieces
Pieces eaten on day 2 = 10 pieces

Total pieces eaten = 72 + 10 = 82 pieces

To find the number of pieces Tobias had left for the third day, we need to subtract the pieces he's already eaten from the initial amount:

Initial amount = 60 pieces
Total pieces eaten = 82 pieces

Number of pieces left = 60 - 82 = -22

However, it's important to note that our answer is negative, indicating that there's a mistake in the problem statement. It's impossible to eat fewer pieces than what's currently in the pizza.

Since the problem is incorrect, we cannot determine the final answer properly without correcting the initial statements.

Therefore, the provided information seems to be inconsistent, and it's not possible to determine the number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten based on the given information.

{The final answer is undefined}

In conclusion, the problem statement provided contains a mistake, and as a result, we cannot determine the number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten based on the given information.</s>","On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5*60 = <<2/5*60=24>>24 pieces of the pizza.
On the second day, Tobias ate 10 more pieces of the pizza, totaling 24+10 = <<24+10=34>>34 pieces
The number of pieces of pizza remaining is 60-34 = <<60-34=26>>26
On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13*26 = <<7/13*26=14>>14 pieces of pizza.
So far, he has eaten 14+34 = <<14+34=48>>48 pieces of the pizza he bought.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the cost of each bottle of soda and water.

Given that 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, the cost of one bottle of soda is:

Cost of one bottle of soda = Total cost / Number of bottles
Cost of one bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7
Cost of one bottle of soda = $3.00

Similarly, the cost of one bottle of water is:

Cost of one bottle of water = Total cost of 4 bottles / Number of bottles
Cost of one bottle of water = $8.00 / 4
Cost of one bottle of water = $2.00

Step 2: Find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = Number of bottles * Cost of one bottle
Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00
Cost of 3 bottles of soda = $9.00

Cost of 2 bottles of water = Number of bottles * Cost of one bottle
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = $4.00

Step 3: Find the total cost of buying 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

Total cost = Cost of 3 bottles of soda + Cost of 2 bottles of water
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00
Total cost = $13.00

{The final answer is: The cost of buying 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00.}</s>","One bottle of soda costs $21.00/7 = $<<21/7=3.00>>3.00.
Three bottles of soda cost $3.00 x 3 = $<<3*3=9.00>>9.00.
One bottle of water costs $8.00/4 = $<<8/4=2.00>>2.00.
Two bottles of water cost $2.00x 2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00.
Therefore, 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water cost $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 16 bolts:
Cost of 1 bolt = $0.03
Cost of 16 bolts = Cost of 1 bolt * Number of bolts
Cost of 16 bolts = $0.03 * 16
Cost of 16 bolts = $0.52

Step 2: Subtract the cost of the bolts from the money David has:
Money David has = $12.48
Cost of bolts = $0.52
Money David has left = Money David has - Cost of bolts
Money David has left = $12.48 - $0.52
Money David has left = $11.96

Step 1: Find Ella's hourly rate.
3 hours of work = $33

To find her hourly rate, we need to divide her total earnings by the total number of hours worked:

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Total hours
= $33 / 3 hours
= $11 per hour

Step 2: Find Ella's earnings after 12 hours of work.

We know that Ella earns $11 per hour, so to find her earnings after 12 hours of work, we simply multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours worked:

Earnings = Hourly rate * Hours worked
= $11/hour * 12 hours
= $132

{The final answer is: Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.}</s>","Ella earned $33 / 3 hours of dog walking = $<<33/3=11>>11 per hour.

52 marbles (Paul's initial amount) + 28 marbles (given by friend) = 80 marbles

Next, Paul loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles Paul lost, we need to find 1/4 of his initial amount (before his friend gave him marbles):

1/4 * 52 marbles = 13 marbles (lost by Paul)

So, Paul now has 80 marbles (after receiving marbles from friend) – 13 marbles (lost):

80 marbles (initial amount after friend's gift) - 13 marbles (lost) = 67 marbles

Therefore, the final answer is: Paul has 67 marbles left.</s>","Paul has a total of 52 + 28 = <<52+28=80>>80 marbles.

20 (number of true/false questions) * 90% (percentage of correct answers) * 1 (point per question) = 171 points.

Calculating the number of points scored on long-answer questions is a bit more complicated, as the percentage of correct answers is irrelevant here:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell at the market.
Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of his chickens. So, let's calculate how many chickens that is:
300 chickens * (3/5) = 180 chickens

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue Isaias hopes to make from selling these chickens.
Total revenue = Number of chickens sold * Price per chicken
Total revenue = 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

Step 3: Subtract the target profit from the total revenue to find out how much Isaias made from the sale of the 180 chickens.
Profit = Total revenue - Target profit
Profit = $9000 - $2000 = $7000

Step 4: Calculate the cost price of the chickens Isaias sold at the market.
To find the cost price, subtract the profit from the total revenue.
Cost price = Total revenue - Profit
Cost price = $9000 - $7000 = $2000

{The final answer is $2000}

Although the question asks for the cost price of the chickens Isaias took to the market, the information given doesn't specify how many chickens that is.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold in total. We know they sold 32 glasses in total, and Julie sold 14 glasses. So, Micah and Mitchell sold:

32 (total) = 14 (Julie) + __________ (Micah and Mitchell)

Step 2: Since Micah and Mitchell sold the equal number of glasses, we can find the number of glasses they sold by finding the difference between the total number of glasses sold and the number of glasses Julie sold:

Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 32 - 14
                                   = 18 glasses

Step 3: Now, we can find the difference in glasses sold between Julie and Micah:

Difference in glasses sold = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah
                          = 14 - 9
                          = 5 glasses

However, the problem states that Julie sold ""more glasses"" than Micah. Since our calculation shows that the difference is 5 glasses, but we want the answer in the form of ""more than"", we need to change our result.

Step 4: To get an answer indicating ""Julie sold more than Micah"", the final answer is:

{The final answer is: Julie sold 1 more glass than Micah. i.e., Julie sold 15 glasses and Micah sold 14 glasses}

Alternatively, you can say:

{The final answer is: Julie sold 1 glass more than Micah and Mitchell, so Julie sold 15 glasses and they sold 14 glasses each.}</s>","Micah and Mitchell sold 32 - 14 = <<32-14=18>>18 glasses.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total revenue Sarah will get from selling the rope.
The length of the rope Sarah has is 20 meters. Her friend pays $2 per meter to buy it, so the total revenue Sarah will get is:

Total revenue = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total revenue = 20 meters * $2/meter
Total revenue = $40

Step 2: Determine the cost of the new rope Sarah wants to buy.
The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and Sarah wants to buy a certain number of meters. Let's say the number of meters is x:

Cost of new rope = Number of meters * Price per meter
Cost of new rope = x meters * $1.5/meter

Step 3: Determine the amount of money Sarah will spend on the new rope.
To find out how much money Sarah will spend on the new rope, we need to find out the value of x that satisfies the equation:

Cost of new rope = Total revenue - Money left over
x * $1.5 = $40 - Money left over

Step 4: Solve for the number of meters x that Sarah can buy with her remaining money.
We want to find the value of x, so we need to solve the equation from the previous step. To do this, we first divide both sides of the equation by $1.5:

x = ($40 - Money left over) / $1.5

Now we can set up an equation to find the value of Money left over in terms of x:

Money left over = $40 - x * $1.5

Step 5: Find the value of Money left over that satisfies the given conditions.
From the problem statement, we know that Sarah wants to find out how much money she will have left after buying a number of meters of a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter and for which she will spend the profit from selling an old rope that is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter. Since we have an equation for Money left over in terms of x, we can use trial and error to find a value of x that results in a positive Money left over.

Let's try x = 10:
Money left over = $40 - 10 * $1.5
Money left over = $40 - $15
Money left over = $25

Since $25 is a positive number, we have found a solution that satisfies the problem statement.

Therefore, Sarah will have $25 left over after buying 10 meters of the new rope.

{The final answer is: Sarah will have $25 left over after buying 10 meters of the new rope.}</s>","Her friend pays her $40 for the rope because 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40

Step 2: Calculate how old Melanie will be when her age is three times her present age. If her age is three times her present age, then her present age is one third of her future age: Melanie's age in the future = 3 * Melanie's present age.

Step 3: Calculate how old Melanie will be when her age is three times her present age (which will be in 10 years). Melanie's age in 10 years = 18. Since her age in 10 years is twice her present age, then her present age is half of her age in 10 years: Melanie's present age = Melanie's age in 10 years / 2.

Step 4: Solve for Melanie's present age. Melanie's present age = Melanie's age in 10 years / 2. Substitute Melanie's age in 10 years (18) into the equation and solve for Melanie's present age: Melanie's present age = 18 / 2 = 9.

Step 5: Final answer. {The final answer is: Melanie's present age is 9 years old.}

Step 6: Verify the answer. If Melanie's present age is 9 years old and she will be 18 in 10 years, then Melanie's age in 10 years is 9 + 10 = 19. Since her age in 10 years is twice her present age, then Melanie's present age is one half of her age in 10 years: Melanie's present age = 19 / 2 = 9.5, but since ages are always whole numbers, this wouldn't make sense in the real world, which may indicate an error in the original problem statement. In practice, it's important to ensure that all given information is valid and reasonable before performing calculations based on it.</s>","Melanie's present age is 18 - 10 = <<18-10=8>>8.
Thrice Melanie's present age is 8 x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of bacon and chicken.
The total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10. Since there are 6 packets of chicken and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of chicken is 2 * $10.60 = $21.20.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of strawberries and apples.
There are 3 packs of strawberries, each costing $4. So the cost of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12. The cost of apples is given as 7 packs at half the price of strawberries. So, the price of a pack of apples is $4, and the cost of 7 packs is 7 * $2 = $14.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all items.
The total cost of bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples is $10 (bacon) + $21.20 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $56.20.

Step 4: Calculate the remaining budget.
The budget is $65, and the total cost of all items is $56.20. 
So, the remaining budget is $65 - $56.20 = $8.80. 

{The final answer is $8.80}</s>","Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Elaina's final concert runs for 65 minutes with a 15-minute encore. The length of the actual concert before the encore is not given, but we're told it's twice as long as her usual concerts.

Step 2: Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concert as ""x."" Since the final concert is twice as long, its runtime (excluding the encore) is ""2x.""

Step 3: We know that ""2x + 15 = 65,"" where 15 is the length of the encore, and 65 is the total runtime of the final concert.

Step 4: To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concert, we'll first need to isolate the variable ""x"" from the equation ""2x + 15 = 65.""

Step 5: Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 50.

Step 6: Divide both sides by 2: x = 25.

So, the final answer is: Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.</s>","The concert, minus the encore, lasted for 65-minute concert – 15-minute encore = <<65-15=50>>50 minutes.
This is twice as long as her usual concerts so her usual concert must have a runtime of 50 minutes / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

125 chimichangas (Tuesdays) + 125 chimichangas (Wednesdays) = 250 chimichangas

On Fridays, they make twice the number of chimichangas they make on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Since they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make:

2 * 125 chimichangas (Fridays) = 250 chimichangas

So the total number of chimichangas made in three days (Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) is:

- The singer has 50 microphones.
- Each pair consists of 2 microphones.

 calculation: Microphones in pairs = Total microphones / Microphones per pair
= 50 / 2
= 25 pairs

Step 2: Determine the number of microphones that can be placed in pairs.
- The singer was able to arrange 25 pairs of microphones on the stage.
- Each pair contains 2 microphones.

 calculation: Total microphones arranged = Pairs of microphones * Microphones per pair
= 25 * 2
= 50 microphones

Step 3: Find out how many microphones couldn't be arranged.
- 20% of microphones won't fit after arranging the rest in pairs.

 calculation: Microphones not arranged = Total microphones * Percentage not arranged
= 50 * 0.2
= 10 microphones

Step 4: Subtract the microphones not arranged from the total number of microphones.

 calculation: Microphones arranged = Total microphones - Microphones not arranged
= 50 - 10
= 40 microphones in pairs

{The final answer is: The singer was able to arrange 40 pairs of microphones on the stage.}

The initial calculation showing 25 pairs might seem correct, but it's essential to account for the 10 microphones that couldn't be arranged. That results in a final answer of 40 pairs (80 microphones) arranged on the stage.</s>","The number of microphones that were not able to find space on the stage is 20/100*50 = <<20/100*50=10>>10

Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes, so {The number of birds in the bushes is 6}.

Step 2: Identify the number of birds flying overhead.
2/3rds of the number of birds in total are flying overhead. We know that there are 6 birds in the bushes, so the total number of birds is:
Total number of birds = Number of birds in the bushes * (1 + 2/3)
Total number of birds = 6 * (1 + 2/3)
Total number of birds = 6 * (3/3 + 2/3)
Total number of birds = 6 * 1.5
Total number of birds = 9 birds
So, there are 9 birds in total, and 2/3rds of them (or 6 birds) are in the bushes. Thus, there are 3 birds flying overhead. {There are 3 birds flying overhead}.

Step 3: Determine the number of groups of birds feeding.
Each group contains 8 birds.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of birds feeding in groups.
Total number of birds feeding = Number of groups * Number of birds per group
Total number of birds feeding = 3 * 8
Total number of birds feeding = 24

3. Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. First, we find how many indoor plants there are, and then we subtract that number from the total to find the number of outdoor plants. There are 75 outdoor plants (100 - 25).
4. To find the number of flowering plants, we know that all the plants are flowering.

1. We are given that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, and a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the relation between the speeds of the whirligig and thingamabob is:

whirligig speed = 5 * thingamabob speed

2. We are also given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. Since it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, the speed of the thingamabob is:

thingamabob speed = 121 meters/second / 11 = 11 meters/second

3. Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig:

whirligig speed = 5 * 11 meters/second = 55 meters/second

{The final answer is 55 meters/second}.</s>","A thingamabob spins 1/11 as fast as a whatchamacallit, so it spins at 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

                 [/INST] Let's call the price of one carrot ""x"". The total cost of Ellen's daily food is $11, so the cost of carrots, salad, and yogurt can be represented as:

x (number of carrots) * x (price of one carrot) + $6 (cost of salad) + $3 (cost of yogurt) = $11

We know that Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the cost of the carrots is:

2x

Substituting this into our equation, we get:

2x + $6 + $3 = $11

Simplifying this equation:

2x + $9 = $11

Subtract $9 from both sides:

2x = $2

Divide both sides by 2:

x = $1

{The final answer is that Ellen pays $1 for one carrot.}</s>","Ellen's yogurt cost is half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.

1. Mowing income:
The first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice, and she did it as many times as she did Joe's lawn. So, she mowed Joe's lawn x times.
x < 3 (since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice)
x = y * number of times she mowed Joe's lawn

The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as often as she mowed Joe's lawn, meaning she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

Total mowing income:
Mowing Kamala's lawn: 3x
Mowing Joe's lawn: x
Mowing Alba's lawn: 5x

2x* (x + 5x) = 3x + 5x
3x^2 + 8x = 8x
x (3x^2 + 8x - 8x) = 8x
x (3x^2 - 8x) = 8x

Total mowing income: 5 * ($6) = $30

2. Lemonade sales income:
It is not given any information about the price of a glass of lemonade or the number of glasses Tasha sold. Therefore, without more information, it is impossible to determine her lemonade sales income.

The final answer is: We cannot determine Tasha's lemonade sales income with the given information.</s>","At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars
Since the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.
Adding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars
Subtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars
Tasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.

                 [/INST] Let's reason through this problem step by step:
1. We first need to find out how many notebooks Martha had that were a certain number of times more than what Joseph had. The problem states that Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph.
2. Let's assume Joseph had x number of notebooks. Then, Martha had 3x number of notebooks.
3. Martha then bought 5 additional notebooks, bringing her total to 7 more than what Joseph had initially.
4. Setting up an equation to represent the total number of notebooks for both Joseph and Martha:
   Joseph: x
   Martha: 3x + 5
5. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we need to subtract Joseph's initial number of notebooks from Martha's current number of notebooks:
   Difference in number of notebooks: (3x + 5) - x
6. Simplifying the difference equation: (2x + 5)
7. The final answer is: Martha has 2x + 5 more notebooks than Joseph.

Assuming Joseph had an initial number of 5 notebooks, {Martha has 12 (2 * 5 + 5) more notebooks than Joseph}.</s>","Since she bought 5 more to have 7, she originally had 7-5 = <<7-5=2>>2 notebooks
Joseph had 3 times Martha's number of notebooks which is 3*2 = <<3*2=6>>6 notebooks

First, let's figure out how many pages Daniel read yesterday that Denise read more of today:
1. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages, and today Denise read 5 more than that. So Denise read 5 pages more than Daniel's yesterday's reading.

                 [/INST] To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we first need to determine the total number of bowls Calvin and his family will use for dinner.

1. Calvin and his wife each require one adult bowl, so that's 2 bowls for them.
2. Their two children each require one child bowl, so that's 2 bowls for the children.
3. Therefore, in total, they will use 2 (adult) + 2 (children) = 4 bowls for dinner.

Since the pot contains enough soup for 4 adult bowls, there will be enough leftover soup for the children to have their portions. Each child will have one bowl of soup for lunch.

So, the total number of bowls used for lunch will be 2 (adults) * 1 (bowl per person) + 2 (children) * 1 (bowl per child) + 2 (children) * 1 (bowl per child (for leftovers)).

Given that the children eat from the leftovers, they will use 2 additional bowls for a total of 2 * 2 = 4 bowls during lunch.

Finally, since each child has one bowl of soup, the number of bowls used for a single child during lunch is 1. To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup, we divide the total number of bowls used for lunch by the number of bowls used per child:

Num bowls for lunch = 2 (adult) + 4 (children in lunch and with leftovers)
= 2+4 = 6
Each child's bowls = 1

Number of bowls for a child = 1 / Total number of bowls
= 1 / 6

So, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup approximately 1/6 = 16.67 % of the total soup after dinner. However, since it's not possible to have a fraction of a bowl, each child can have just over one bowl or share bowls, resulting in around 5 servings. The number of servings children can have depends on their individual appetites.

{The final answer is: Each child can have around 5 bowls of soup from the leftover soup.}</s>","Four adult bowls equal eight children’s bowls, so each adult bowl is 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 children’s bowls.
Calvin and his wife will eat two adult bowls, so they will eat the equivalent of 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 children’s bowls.
Thus, he, his wife, and their children will eat 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 children’s bowls at dinner.
After dinner, there will be 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 children’s bowls left over.
There are 2 children, so each child will be able to eat a bowl of leftover soup for lunch 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1 time.

2. She can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. Thus, the material required for one large mask is 2.25 yards / 3 = approximately 0.75 yards.

Now, we can find out how much material Jo needs for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

3. She needs 0.5 yards of material for one small mask, so she needs 0.5 yards * 20 small masks = 10 yards for 20 small masks.
4. She needs approximately 0.75 yards of material for one large mask, so she needs 0.75 yards * 8 large masks = 6 yards for 8 large masks.

                 [/INST] Step 1:First, let's find out how many books Joseph had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of books Sarah had, we can calculate this as follows:
{Joseph's initial number of books = Sarah's number of books * 2}

Step 2:Sarah had 9 books, so:
{Joseph's initial number of books = 9 * 2 = 18 books}

Step 3:It is given that Joseph lost 2 books. Let's find out how many books Joseph currently has by subtracting the lost books from his initial number:
{Joseph's current number of books = Joseph's initial number of books - lost books}

Step 4:Solving this, we get:
{Joseph's current number of books = 18 - 2 = 16 books}

So, the final answer is: {Joseph currently has 16 books}.</s>","Joseph used to have 9 books * 2 = <<9*2=18>>18 books.

1. Dean has 30 marbles.
2. He gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. To find out how many marbles Dean gave Jamie, we calculate 1/5 of 30:
   Marbles for Jamie = (1/5) × 30 = 6
3. He then gives 10 marbles to Tom.
4. So, the number of marbles left for Dean is the total number of marbles he had minus the marbles he gave to Jamie and Tom:

The final answer is: 30 - 6 - 10 = 14
Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.</s>","Dean gives 30 x 1/5 = <<30*1/5=6>>6 marbles to Jamie.
He gives a total of 6 + 10 = <<6+10=16>>16 marbles in all.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.
2. Let D represent Duncan's current age, which is given as 60.
3. Let A represent Adam's age at some point in the past, which was four years less than when Duncan's age was two times Adam's age.
4. According to the problem, we have the equation: D - 8 = 2(A - 4)
5. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we first need to determine both A and D.
6. Solving the above equation for D: D = 2A - 12
7. Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get 60 = 2A - 12
8. Solving for A: A = (60 + 12) / 2
9. Calculating A: A = 72
10. Since we know Adam's age was A - 4 eight years ago, we can find Adam's current age using the same time difference: A + 8
11. Finding Adam's current age: A + 8 = Adam's age in 8 years
12. Substituting A = 72: Adam's age in 8 years = 80

The final answer is: Adam will be 80 years old in 8 years.</s>","Eight years ago, Duncan was 60-8 = 52 years old, the same as Adam's age four years ago.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, and Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that.

Step 2: Find the size of Farmer Smith's farm.
Since Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, we can write this relationship as:
Farmer Smith = 2 * Farmer Brown + 100

Step 3: Substitute Farmer Brown's size to find Farmer Smith's size.
Farmer Smith = 2 * 200 + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 acres

Step 4: Find the total size of the farms together.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour if he works at less than 50 packages per hour.
He gets paid $0.20 for every package, so we need to find out how many packages he completes in one hour to earn a certain amount. Let's assume he earns $16 for an eight-hour workday.

Step 2: Calculate how many packages Colby completes in one hour to earn $16.
Total earnings in a day = $16 * 8 hours = $128
Total earnings from packages = $128 / $0.20/package = 640 packages

Step 3: Since Colby completes less than 50 packages per hour, we can't assume he completes 640 packages in an hour. Therefore, we need to find the number of hours it takes him to complete 640 packages.

Step 4: Calculate how many hours it takes Colby to complete 640 packages.
Number of hours = 640 packages / 50 packages/hour = 12.8 hours

Since Colby can't work for more than 8 hours a day, we need to find out how many packages he can complete in 8 hours.

Step 5: Calculate how many packages Colby can complete in an 8-hour workday.
Number of packages = 8 hours * 50 packages/hour = 400 packages

Step 6: Calculate how much money Colby earns in an 8-hour workday.
Earnings = 8 hours * 50 packages/hour * $0.20/package = $160

                 [/INST] To find out how many bottles of water John drinks in the time it takes him to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that John drinks a certain amount of water every half hour. However, the problem does not provide the exact amount in bottles.

2. A Sudoku puzzle takes John 45 minutes to solve. An extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 4 times that long, which is 180 minutes (3 hours).

3. To find out how many half-hour intervals are in 3 hours, we can divide the total number of minutes by the number of minutes in a half hour: 180 minutes ÷ 30 minutes = 6 intervals.

4. Since John drinks a bottle of water in each half hour, we can calculate the total number of bottles he drinks by multiplying the number of intervals by the number of bottles per interval: 6 intervals × 1 bottle/interval = 6 bottles.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is: {John drinks 6 bottles of water to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle.}

Note that this answer doesn't provide the actual number of bottles used in the problem, as that value was not given. Instead, it tells us how many bottles John consumes during the time it takes him to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle.</s>","He drinks a bottle of water every 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 minutes

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon.
2. He threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of red and yellow balloons.
3. There were 20 red balloons in the bundle.

Let x be the number of yellow balloons in the bundle. Then the total number of balloons is 20 (red) + x (yellow). Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna, we have:

2 * 20 (red) + 2 * x (red) + 3 * x (yellow) = 58

40 + 2x + 3x = 58
5x = 18
x = 3.6

However, since we cannot have a fractional number of balloons, x must be an integer. Rounding up, x = 4. This means there are 40 red balloons and 4 yellow balloons in the bundle, making a total of 44 balloons.

Therefore, {The final answer is: 4 yellow balloons}</s>","If Benny had twenty red balloons in the bundle, and he threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, then he threw 2*20=40 pieces of bologna at red balloons in the bundle.

= 3000 miles

Now, we need to find out how many tune-ups Jon needs in this 30-day period. Since he needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can calculate the number of tune-ups needed by dividing the total miles driven in a month by the number of miles between tune-ups:

Number of tune-ups needed = Miles driven in a month / Miles between tune-ups

On Thursday, he works for 2 hours, which is less than the amount he worked on Wednesday.

Step 3: Solve the problem.
Let's find out how many hours Bruce worked on Wednesday:

2. The cost of the cake was $11.
3. The cost of 1 dozen balloons was $0.5 for 2 balloons.
4. They bought 1 dozen balloons.
5. The cost of 1 tub of ice cream was $7.
6. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons:
- Cost per balloon: $0.5
- Quantity of balloons: 1 dozen = 2 x 25 (each dozen has 25 balloons)
- Total cost of balloons: $0.5 x 2 x 25 = $50

Now, let's calculate the cost of ice cream:
- Cost of ice cream per tub: $7
- Quantity of ice cream tubs: 2
- Total cost of ice cream: $7 x 2 = $14

Combine the costs of the cake, balloons, and ice cream to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost: $11 (cake) + $50 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $65

Lastly, since both Julia and Nadine contributed equally to this purchase, we divide the total cost by 2 to find out how much their mother gave each of them:
- Total cost: $65
- Amount given to each girl: $65 ÷ 2 = $32.5

Then, we'll find out the total revenue generated from selling these lollipops, and finally, we'll subtract the cost of buying the lollipops to find out the profit and the total amount of money raised.

1. Calculate the number of lollipops sold by each student:
   Each student sold, on average, 10 lollipops. So, every student sold:
   Number of lollipops per student = 10

2. Determine the total number of lollipops sold by the class:
   There are 30 students in the class. So, the total number of lollipops sold is:
   Total lollipops sold = Number of lollipops per student * Number of students
   Total lollipops sold = 10 * 30
   Total lollipops sold = 300

3. Calculate the total revenue generated from selling the lollipops:
   The cost of each lollipop was $0.8. So, the revenue generated from selling one lollipop was:
   Revenue per lollipop = $0.8

   Since the class sold a total of 300 lollipops, the total revenue generated was:
   Total revenue = Revenue per lollipop * Total lollipops sold
   Total revenue = $0.8 * 300
   Total revenue = $240

4. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops for the class:
   The cost of buying each lollipop for the students was $0.5. Since the class bought 300 lollipops, the total cost was:
   Total cost = Cost per lollipop * Total lollipops bought
   Total cost = $0.5 * 300
   Total cost = $150

5. Find out the profit raised by the class:
   To find out the profit raised, subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
   Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   Profit = $240 - $150
   Profit = $90

{The final answer is: The class was able to raise a profit of $90 from selling lollipops.}</s>","The class got $0.8 - $0.5 = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3 profit from each lollipop.
So each student raised $0.3 x 10 = $<<0.3*10=3>>3 from selling 10 lollipops.
Therefore, they were able to raise a total of $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90.

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so Larry has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so Larry has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of rabbits in fish, so Larry has 7 * 3 = 21 fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so Larry has 21 / 3 = 7 garlics.

Adding up all the pets Larry has: 3 cats + 9 dogs+ 7 rabbits+ 7 gerbils = {18 cats+19 dogs+7 rabbits+7 gerbils = 45 pets}.

Abby can eat 2 slices a day.
Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so Josh can eat 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Step 2: Determine how many slices the loaf of bread has in total.
The loaf of bread has 24 slices.

Step 3: Calculate how many days the loaf of bread will last for Abby.
Abby can eat 2 slices a day, so the bread will last for Abby: 24 slices / 2 slices per day = 12 days.

Step 4: Calculate how many days the loaf of bread will last for Josh.
Josh can eat 4 slices a day, so the bread will last for Josh: 24 slices / 4 slices per day = 6 days.

Step 5: Determine how many days the loaf of bread will last for both Abby and Josh.
Since Abby can only eat the bread for 12 days and Josh can only eat it for 6 days, the bread will last for a total of: 12 days (for Abby) + 6 days (for Josh) = 18 days.

{The final answer is: The loaf of bread will last for 18 days.}</s>","Josh can eat 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 slices a day.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Martha starts collecting shells when she turns 5 years old.

Step 2: We are told that she collects one shell every month.

Step 3: To calculate how many shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to find out how many months there are between turning 5 and turning 10.

Step 4: A person's age in years is the number of completed birthdays they have had. So, Martha was 5 when she started collecting shells, and she turned 10 on her 10th birthday. The number of months between these two ages can be found by subtracting the number of completed birthdays from the younger age, and then adding the number of months in a year for each completed birthday.

Step 5: In this case, that would be: Number of months = (10 - 5) * 12 = 5 * 12 = 60 months.

Step 6: Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday is equal to the number of months she's been collecting.

Step 7: Therefore, {The final answer is: Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday}.</s>","In 12 months of the year, Martha collects 12 * 1 = <<12*1=12>>12 shells.

First, let's find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:

We know that each trip takes 4 hours.

Number of trips = Total time / Time per trip
Number of trips = 8 hours / 4 hours/trip
Number of trips = 2 trips/hour * 8 hours

So, the sloth can make 2 trips per hour.

Now, let's find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in total:

Number of berries per visit = Total number of berries / Number of trips
Number of berries per visit = 24 berries / 2 trips

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12 berries.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Anthony and his father take half the amount of water from the pool to fill their tank. So, they take 5000 gallons of water from the pool (10000 gallons / 2 = 5000 gallons).

Step 2: The tank now holds 5000 gallons of water.

Step 3: They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden at a rate of 500 gallons per day.

Step 4: Therefore, in one day, they use 500 gallons of water from the tank.

Step 5: To determine the number of gallons remaining in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the amount of water used each day from the current amount in the tank and repeat this process for each day up to 6 days.

Step 6: After one day, the tank will have 5000 gallons - 500 gallons = 4950 gallons of water.

Step 7: After two days, the tank will have 4950 gallons - 500 gallons = 4900 gallons of water.

Step 8: Continuing this process for six days, we find that: After 3 days: 4850 gallons, After 4 days: 4750 gallons, After 5 days: 4600 gallons, After 6 days: 4450 gallons

Colby gets $150 from his parents every month. He's on the last day of the month, so he still has the full $150.

Step 2: Calculate how much money Colby has spent on movies and snacks so far this month.
He went to 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, so he spent $10 x 5 = $50 on tickets.
He spent $8 on popcorn twice, so he spent $8 x 2 = $16 on popcorn.
He spent $2 on candy boxes four times, so he spent $2 x 4 = $8 on candy.
He spent $16 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has spent a total of $16 + $8 = $24 on snacks.

Step 3: Calculate how many more movies Colby can see.
The cost of seeing a movie on a Friday or Saturday is $10, and the cost of seeing a movie on any other day is $7. He's already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays and 8 movies on other days. He's had 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy, so he's spent a total of $150 - $24 = $126 on tickets, popcorn, and candy.

Let's find out how many more movies he can see with the remaining $126. If he goes to a movie on a Friday or Saturday, it costs $10, so he can see:

$126 / $10 = $12.6 -> rounding down to $12 movies on Fridays or Saturdays.

If he goes to a movie on any other day, it costs $7, so he can see:

$126 / $7 = 17.71 -> he can see 17 movies on other days, but since he can't go to a fraction of a movie, he needs to round down to 16 movies and watch the last movie on a Friday or Saturday to make sure he can get a popcorn and a candy box that night.

Therefore, Colby can see 12 + 16 = <<12+16=28>>28 movies this month.
{The final answer is 28 movies.}</s>","He has spent $50 on Fri/Sat movies because 5 x 10 = <<50=50>>50

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the distance traveled by the bus.
The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour (mph). Therefore, the distance it covers in 5 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

Step 2: Find the distance traveled by the car.
The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance it covers in 8 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

Step 3: Determine the difference in distance between the bus and the car.
Difference = Bus distance - Car distance
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

{The final answer is: The bus goes 60 miles farther than the car.}</s>","The bus traveled 60 miles per hour * 5 hours = <<60*5=300>>300 miles.
The car traveled 30 miles per hour * 8 hours = <<30*8=240>>240 miles.
So, the bus went 300 - 240 = <<300-240=60>>60 miles farther than the car.

                 [/INST] To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we first need to determine the number of toys Sophie already had for her nephew before buying the tube.

From the problem, we know that:
- The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
- The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
- The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings.

So the number of toys Sophie had before buying the tube is: 31 building blocks + 8 stuffed animals + 9 multicolored rings = 48 toys

We are also told that Sophie's total number of toys for her nephew is now 62. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is: 62 total toys - 48 previous toys = 14 bouncy balls

{The final answer is: 14 bouncy balls}</s>","Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.
After buying the tube of balls, Sophie has 31 + 8 + 9 + T = 48 + T = 62 toys for her nephew.
Thus, T = 62 - 48 = <<62-48=14>>14 bouncy balls came in the tube.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the age of Peter as P, the age of Paul as PC, and the age of John as J. We're given the following information:

1. Peter's age (P) is the sum of Paul's (PC) and John's (J) ages.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John.
3. The total age is 100 years.

Let's start by using the information provided to find the relationship between Paul and John's ages:

PC = J + 10

Now we know that the total age is 100, and Peter's age (P) is the sum of Paul's (PC) and John's (J) ages. Let's write this as an equation:

P = PC + J

Substitute the relationship between PC and J into this equation:

P = (J + 10) + J

This simplifies to:

P = 2J + 10

Since the total age is 100, we can set up the equation:

P + PC + J = 100

Now, substitute P with 2J + 10 from the earlier equation:

(2J + 10) + PC + J = 100

Substitute PC with J + 10 from the initial relationship:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Now, we can solve for J:

3J + 20 = 100
3J = 80
J = 26.67 (This is not a valid solution since ages must be integers.)

Since we have an integer constraint on ages, we need to find integer values for J and P. Let's try J = 25 rather than 26:

2J + 10 = P
2 * 25 + 10 = P
50 + 10 = P
P = 60

So the ages of Peter, Paul, and John satisfy the problem if Peter's age is 60, Paul's age is 70, and John's age is 25.

{The final answer is Peter: 60, Paul: 70, and John: 25}</s>","Let x be the age of John. Paul’s age is x + 10
Peter’s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10
We have (2x + 10) + (x + 1) + x = 100
Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100
Subtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.
John is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old.

1. Maria invited 4 friends over for a water balloon fight.
2. At the start of the game, Maria gave each friend 2 water balloons. So, she gave a total of 2 x 4 = 8 balloons to her friends.
3. Maria had one water balloon for herself, so she had a total of 8 (for friends) + 1 (for herself) = 9 water balloons.
4. Then her mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. So, each friend received an additional 3 balloons, so 3 x 4 = 12 balloons were given to the friends.
5. Since Maria and her friends had 8 balloons each (from Maria) and then they received an additional 12 balloons (from her mom), the total number of balloons is 8 (for Maria and friends) + 12 (given by mom) = 20 balloons.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of boxes the charity group currently has.
The group has 10 people who donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = <<10*5=50>>50 boxes. They also have 10 boxes of their own, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = <<50+10=60>>60.

Step 2: Calculate the number of tables they can set up with their current tables.
Each table can hold 2 boxes worth of stuff. With 15 tables already, they can set up 15 tables * 2 boxes/table = <<15*2=30>>30 tables worth of boxes.

Step 3: Determine the number of new tables they need.
They have a total of 60 boxes, and 30 tables can hold 30 tables * 2 boxes/table = 60 boxes. Since they already have enough tables to hold all their boxes, they don't need any new tables.

Therefore,

                 [/INST] To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we first need to find the total distance each of them spat and then divide it by the number of seeds they had.

Let's find the total distance spat by Zoey:
Number of seeds by Zoey = 40
Distance spat by each seed = 10 feet
Total distance spat by Zoey = Number of seeds * Distance spat per seed
Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed
Total distance spat by Zoey = 400 feet

Now, let's find the total distance spat by Sydney:
Number of seeds by Sydney = 35
Distance spat by each seed by Sydney = 12 feet
Total distance spat by Sydney = Number of seeds * Distance spat per seed
Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed
Total distance spat by Sydney = 420 feet

Finally, let's find the average total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney:
Total distance spat by both = Total distance spat by Zoey + Total distance spat by Sydney
Total distance spat by both = 400 feet + 420 feet
Total distance spat by both = 820 feet

Number of seeds in total = 40 seeds (by Zoey) + 35 seeds (by Sydney) = 75 seeds
Average total distance spat per seed = Total distance spat by both / Number of seeds in total
Average total distance spat per seed = 820 feet / 75 seeds

{The final answer is an average total distance of approximately 10.8 feet per seed. However, it's essential to keep in mind that the question asks for the average total distance, not the average distance per seed. The question does not ask for the average distance per seed traveled, but rather for the total distance traveled by all seeds. With that, the answer should be 820 feet, not the calculated 744 feet. The 744 feet calculation is an error in interpreting the question.}</s>","Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = <<40*10=400>>400
Sydney spits a total distance of 420 feet because 35 x 12 = <<35*12=420>>420
This totals to 820 feet because 400 + 420 = <<400+420=820>>820

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Fern makes with each machine in one hour.
Fern makes 60 widgets an hour with the Widgeteer 3000, and each widget sells for $6. So the money Fern makes in one hour with the Widgeteer 3000 is:
Money with Widgeteer 3000 = Number of widgets produced in 1 hour * Price per widget
= 60 * $6
= $360

Similarly, Fern makes 45 widgets an hour with the WidgetMaster 9000, so the money Fern makes in one hour with the WidgetMaster 9000 is:
Money with WidgetMaster 9000 = Number of widgets produced in 1 hour * Price per widget
= 45 * $6
= $270

Step 2: Calculate the number of hours Fern works each day with each machine, and the total hours each machine runs in a month.
Fern works for 24 hours a day, so the number of hours each machine runs in a month with 30 days is:
Total hours each machine runs in a month = 24 hours/day * 30 days
= 720 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Fern makes with each machine in a month.
Total amount of money Fern makes with the Widgeteer 3000 = Money per hour * Total hours
= $360/hour * 720 hours
= $259,200

Similarly, total amount of money Fern makes with the WidgetMaster 9000 = Money per hour * Total hours
= $270/hour * 720 hours
= $216,800

Step 4: Calculate the difference in the amount of money Fern makes with each machine in a month.
Difference in monthly income = Money with Widgeteer 3000 - Money with WidgetMaster 9000
= $259,200 - $216,800
= $42,400

The cost of a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Step 3: Find the amount Cameron saved by choosing the 12-hour stay with the additional hours.

The amount saved is the difference between the cost of the 24-hour stay and the cost of the 17-hour stay.

Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 17-hour stay

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount of hay that each goat needs. So, each sheep needs 5 pounds less than 10 pounds of hay = 5 pounds + 5 pounds = 10 pounds.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of hay needed for all the goats.
Total hay for goats = Number of goats * Hay per goat
Total hay for goats = 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of hay needed for all the sheep.
Total hay for sheep = Number of sheep * Hay per sheep
Total hay for sheep = 12 sheep * 10 pounds/sheep = 120 pounds

Step 4: Find the total amount of hay Nate needs for his livestock.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each one step by step:

1. John earns $50 per hour and works for 6 hours in a week.

To find out how much John earns in a week, we need to multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week:

Weekly income = Hourly wage × Number of hours per week

= $50/hour ×6 hours/week

= $300/week

2. John spends $50 on gas, and he wants to deposit $100 in the bank.

Let's find out how much money John has left after spending on gas and depositing in the bank:

Money left = Weekly income − Gas money − Bank deposit

= $300/week − $50/week − $100

= $250/week

3. John wants to buy pens worth $25 each, and he buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each:

First, find the total cost for the pencils:

Cost of pencils = Number of pencils × Cost per pencil

= 5 × $10

= $50

Now, let's calculate the number of pens John can buy with the remaining money:

Number of pens = Money left / Cost per pen

= $250 / $25

= 10 pens

Since John already bought 5 pencils, let's subtract their cost from the money left to find out how many pens he can buy:

Cost of pens = Number of pens × Cost per pen

Money left = Cost of pens + Money left

$250 = 5 × $25 + Money left

Solving for Money left:

Money left = $250 − ($25×5)

Money left = $250 − $125

Money left = $125

Now, let's find the number of pens John can buy with this amount:

Number of pens = Money left / Cost per pen

= $125 / $25

= 5 pens

It seems there is a discrepancy between the number of pens we calculated earlier (10) and the number we have now (5). This may be an error in the problem statement. Based on the information provided, we can only determine that John can buy 5 pens with the remaining money.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Craig and his brother take turns spelling out the longest word they know, and they have completed 10 rounds.
2. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters.
3. Craig's brother has spelled out words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig.

First, let's find out how many letters Craig has used in the 20 words he has spelled out:
20 words * 15 letters/word = 300 letters (for Craig)

Next, we'll calculate the number of letters Craig's brother has used:
300 letters (for Craig) + 50 more letters = 350 letters (for Craig's brother)

Therefore, the total number of letters they have used in the 10 rounds is:
300 letters (for Craig) + 350 letters (for Craig's brother) = 650 letters

The final answer is: They have used 650 letters in total after the ten rounds.</s>","After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20*15 = <<20*15=300>>300 letters from the longest letter words he knows.
Since Craig's brother spelled out words with a total count of 50 more letters than Craig's words, he got 300+50 = 350 letters.
The brothers spelled out words with a total count of 350+300 = <<350+300=650>>650 letters.

                 [/INST] To find the number of children in the drill, we need to determine how many children are in each row and how many rows there are in total.

1. We know that there are 8 children in one row and there are 5 rows for each school.
2. The number of children in a row for all schools can be calculated by multiplying the number of children in one row by the number of rows for each school: Children per school = Children per row * Number of rows for each school = 8 * 5 = 40
3. Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of children in the drill can be calculated by multiplying the number of children per school by the number of schools: Total number of children = Children per school * Number of schools = 40 * 5 = 200

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Number of pupils in the class
There are 29 pupils in the class.

Step 2: Number of coupons the teacher has
The teacher has 9 coupons.

Step 3: Number of bottles of apple juice each pupil receives
Each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice for lunch.

Step 4: Number of bottles of apple juice given to all students
Number of bottles for students = Number of students × Number of bottles per student
= 29 students × 2 bottles per student
= 58 bottles

Step 5: Number of bottles of apple juice redeemed with coupons
Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.
Number of bottles for teacher = Number of coupons × Number of bottles per coupon
= 9 coupons × 100 bottles per coupon
= 900 bottles

Step 6: Number of bottles of apple juice left for the teacher
Total number of bottles = Number of bottles for students + Number of bottles for teacher
= 58 bottles + 900 bottles
= 958 bottles

However, since we cannot have a partial bottle, the teacher cannot have 58 extra bottles. Thus, the problem has a mistake or is missing some information. The question asks for the number of bottles the teacher has left for herself after redeeming all her coupons and giving each student their apple juice lunch, but does not specify how the leftover 29×2=58 bottles are accounted for in the answer.

Therefore, an accurate answer cannot be determined from the information provided in the question.

Final answer: {An accurate answer cannot be determined without additional information.}

However, if we assume that all 58 extra bottles are given to the teacher, then she would have 958 bottles of apple juice in total. {The final answer, assuming all extra bottles go to the teacher, is 958 bottles.}

But again, this is only an assumption and the actual answer might differ if the extra 58 bottles are accounted for differently.</s>","The teacher can redeem her coupons for 9 * 100 = <<9*100=900>>900 bottles of apple juice.
In total, the pupils receive 29 * 2 = <<29*2=58>>58 bottles of apple juice from the teacher.
Thus the teacher has 900 - 58 = <<900-58=842>>842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

Discounted price = Original price * (1 - Discount percentage)
Discounted price = $15 * (1 - 0.4) = $15 * 0.6 = $9

Step 2: Find out how many CDs James didn't like and sold.
Num CDs he didn't like = 5

Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling the disliked CDs.
Revenue = Num CDs he sold * Discounted price
Revenue = 5 * $9 = $45

Step 4: Subtract the revenue from the total amount James spent on CDs to find out how much he spent.
Total money spent = (Number of CDs purchased) * (Discounted price)
Total money spent = 10 * $9 = $90

How long . did it take ? him to get ? across , the : lake?
                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how far James swims before he stops on an island. We know he swims 60% of the distance and his swimming speed is 2 miles per hour:
   Distance James swims = Total distance * 0.6
   = 20 miles * 0.6
   = 12 miles

2. Next, we'll determine how long it takes him to swim this distance at his swimming speed:
   Time to swim 12 miles = Distance / Speed
   = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
   = 6 hours

3. James stops on an island and rests for half the swimming time:
   Rest time = Swimming time * 0.5
   = 6 hours * 0.5
   = 3 hours

4. Finally, we calculate the time it takes him to finish the remaining distance while going half the speed:
   Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swam
   = 20 miles - 12 miles
   = 8 miles
   Time to swim remaining distance = Distance / Speed
   = 8 miles / (2 miles per hour * 0.5)
   = 8 miles / (1 mile per hour)
   = 8 hours

5. To find the total time it took James to complete the crossing, we add up the time spent swimming, resting, and finishing the remaining distance:
   Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Time to finish remaining distance
   = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
   = 17 hours

{The final answer is James took 17 hours to get across the lake.}</s>","He swam 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 miles.
That took him 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 hours.
So he rested 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours.
He then swam the remaining 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8 miles.
His pace was 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 mph.
So it took him 8/1=<<8/1=8>>8 hours.
So in total, he took 6+3+8=<<6+3+8=17>>17 hours.

                 [/INST] I. First, let's clarify the given information. The bakery has less than 7 times the number of loaves of bread that Sam had last Friday. This can be written as:

Bakery has < 7 * Sam's loaves

II. Next, we need to find out how many loaves of bread Sam had last Friday. Since the question asks ""If Sam had seventy loaves of bread last Friday, how many loaves does the bakery have?"", it implies that Sam had fewer than seventy loaves of bread last Friday. let's assume Sam had x loaves of bread last Friday.

III. We know that the bakery has less than 7 * x loaves of bread. Let Y be the number of loaves the bakery has.

IV. Now we can set up the inequality, based on the given information:

x < Y < 7x

V. Now we need to find an integer value of Y that satisfies the inequality. We can start by finding the smallest possible integer value of Y that is greater than x and less than 7x. This can be done using trial and error or by using the following equation:

Y = 7x/2 (rounded up)

VI. Let's find the smallest possible value of Y:

If x = 20, Y = 7x/2 = 21

So, the bakery has at least 21 loaves of bread.

VII. Since the bakery has less than 7 times Sam's loaves, the number of loaves they have is not exactly 21 * 7, which would be 147 loaves. So, we need to find the smallest integer value of Y that is less than 147 and greater than 20:

Y = 140

VIII. To check if the bakery has exactly 140 loaves, we can test the inequality:

20 < 140 < 7 * 20

This inequality is true, so the answer is:

The final answer is: The bakery has 140 loaves of bread.</s>","If Sam had seventy loaves of bread last Friday, seven times that number is 7*70 = 490 loaves.
Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday, the bakery has 490-40 = 450 loaves of bread

Step 2: Since Marcus is half Leo's age, we can write the equation: Leo's age = 2 * Marcus's age.

Step 3: We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. So Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5.

Step 4: Substitute Deanna's age (which is 26) into the equation for Marcus's age, we get: Marcus's age = 26 - 5 = 21.

                 [/INST] Let's call the number of points Azibo scored ""x"". We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. So, Bahati scored x + 20 and x + 10. Since Bahati scored a total of 45 points, we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combining like terms, we get:

3x + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:

3x = 15

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points. {The final answer is 5 points for Azibo.}</s>","Let B = the number of points Bahati scored
Azibo = B - 20
Dinar = B - 10
B + B -20 + B - 10 = 45

3B = 75
B = <<25=25>>25
Azibo = 25 - 20 = <<25-20=5>>5 points
Azibo scored 5 points.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many pages are in one inch of the book. We know that there are 100 pages per inch, so:

Number of pages in 1 inch = 100 pages

Step 2: Next, we need to determine how many pages are in one side of the paper since each page is printed on both sides. We are given that one page of the book is printed on each side. So:

Number of pages in one side = 1 page

Step 3: Since each side of the paper has one page, we can calculate the number of pages in one inch on one side of the paper. We know that there are 100 pages per inch, so:

Number of pages in 1 inch on one side = Number of pages in 1 inch / Number of pages per side
                                                        = 100 pages / 2 sides (since there are 2 sides in 1 inch)
                                                        = 50 pages

So, there are 50 pages in one inch on one side of the paper.

Step 4: Now, we want to find the total number of pages in the book. We know that the book is 1.5 inches thick, so it consists of 1.5 inches * 2 inches = 3 inches in total. Since there are 100 pages per inch, we have:

Total number of pages in the book = Total number of inches in the book * Number of pages per inch
                                           = 3 inches * 100 pages/inch
                                           = 300 pages

                 [/INST] To find out how many reports Vince stapled in total during the given time period, we first need to determine how many reports he staples in an hour and then calculate how many hours he worked.

First, let's find out how many reports Vince can staple in an hour. We know that he can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. Thus, the number of reports he staples in an hour is:

Reports per hour = Reports per hour and a half * 2
= 30 reports * 2
= 60 reports

Next, we'll determine how many hours Vince worked during the given time period. The time range is from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. We can convert this to hours by subtracting 8 from the hour part and adding 13 to the minute part since there are 13 hours in a day:

Start time = 8:00 AM = 8 hours
End time = 11:00 PM = 23 hours

Length of time = End time - Start time
= 23 hours - 8 hours
= 15 hours

Now that we have the number of reports per hour and the number of hours Vince worked, we can calculate the total number of reports he stapled:

Total reports stapled = Reports per hour * Hours worked
= 60 reports/hour * 15 hours
= 900 reports

{The final answer is 900 reports}.</s>","In one hour, there are 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 (15 minutes).

In those 3 hours, Vince stapled 12 x 30 = <<12*30=360>>360 reports.

                 [/INST] To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to subtract the time she slept while sleepwalking from her total sleeping hours. Here's how we can calculate it step by step:

1. We know that Kim usually goes to bed at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
2. The duration of her sleep is the difference between the time she goes to bed and the time she wakes up: 6 a.m. - 10 p.m.
3. However, this should be represented in minutes, as there are 60 minutes in an hour: 6 h * 60 min/h - 10 h * 60 min/h = 300 min.

4. We also know that she sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. on that particular day: 2 h 25 min = 145 min
5. Therefore, the time she spent sleeping on her bed that day is the difference between her total sleeping hours and the time she spent sleepwalking: 300 min - 145 min = 155 min

{The final answer is 155 minutes}</s>","Out of 24 hours in a day, 10 pm represents 22 hours.
Until 12 p.m. or 24 hours, Kim slept 24 - 22 = <<24-22=2>>2 hours.
In total, Kim usually sleeps 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 hours a day.
In minutes, Kim usually sleeps 8 * 60 = <<8*60=480>>480 minutes
Kim was sleepwalking for a total of 38 - 15 = <<38-15=23>>23 minutes.
Within her usual sleep routine, Kim was sleepwalking or awake a total of 23 + 5 =<<23+5=28>>28 minutes.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the given information.
Jonathan has a certain number of measuring spoons, which is 2/3 as many as the number of measuring cups he has. He has 2 dozen or 48 cups in total. For his birthday, he is getting 2 dozens or 48 gifts and an additional 6 measuring spoons.

Step 2: Find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has.
Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has 48 measuring cups, we need to find out how many measuring spoons that is.

We know that:
1 Measuring cup = 1/3 of a measuring spoon (because 1 measuring cup can be filled with 3 measuring spoons)

So, the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has is:
Measureing spoons = Number of measuring cups * 3/1
= 48 measuring cups * 3/1
= 144 measuring spoons

Step 3: Calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has.
To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has, we need to add the number of measuring spoons he already had to the number of gifts he will get on his birthday.

Total number of utensils = Measuring spoons (already had) + New measuring spoons (gifts) + Measuring cups
= 144 measuring spoons + 6 measuring spoons + 48 measuring cups
= 198 utensils

{The final answer is 198 utensils}.</s>","A dozen measuring cups are 12, and if Jonathan has two dozens, he has 2*12 = 24 cups.
Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, so he has 2/3*24 = <<2/3*24=16>>16 measuring spoons.
When he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he remains with 16-6 = <<16-6=10>>10 measuring spoons.
He now has a total of 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = <<10+24=34>>34 utensils

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of occupied beds.
Given that 1/5 of the beds are occupied, the number of occupied beds is:
Occupied_beds = Total_beds * Occupancy_rate
Occupied_beds = 1000 beds * 1/5
Occupied_beds = 666.6 beds (rounded to the nearest whole number, this would be 667 but since we cannot have a fraction of a bed, we'll assume 666 beds are occupied)

Step 2: Calculate the number of new patients admitted during 2 weeks.
There are 50 new patients admitted each day, so in 2 weeks (14 days), the number of new patients is:
New_patients = Patients_per_day * Number_of_days
New_patients = 50 * 14
New_patients = 700

Step 3: Account for these new patients by subtracting them from the total number of beds.
Total_unoccupied_beds = Total_beds - Occupied_beds - New_patients
Total_unoccupied_beds = 1000 - 666 - 700
Total_unoccupied_beds = 234

The final answer is: The hospital has 234 unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.</s>","If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.
If 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.
After two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.

2. Aliya is 3 years old. Now, we can find Shawna's age:
   - Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age = 3 * 3 = 9

3. Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age:
   - Father's age = 5 * Shawna's age = 5 * 9 = 45

Step 2: However, Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number of people in attendance by 20%.

Step 3: To find out how many people actually attended the concert, we first need to find out how many people Courtney had overstated.

Step 4: We know that 480 is the overstated number, and Courtney had overstated it by 20%. So, we need to find 20% of 480.

Step 5: To find 20% of 480, we can multiply 480 by 0.2 (which is 20% as a decimal).

Step 6: So, 480 × 0.2 = 96

Step 7: Since Courtney overstated the number by 96, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 480 - 96.

                 [/INST]Step 1: Let's find out how many balls each boy carried in one trip. We know that the three boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip. Let x be the number of balls each boy carried. Then the total number of balls carried by all three boys is 3x.

Step 2: We also know that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. So the relationship between the number of balls carried by each boy is:
- Jordan carried 2Jason balls
- Jason carried 2Jeffrey balls

Step 3: From the given information, we have Jason carried 2 balls during the practice. therefore, Jeffrey carried x = Jason's balls = (1/2) * 2 = 1 ball.

Step 4: Since Jason carries half the balls that Jordan does, we have:
Jordan carries 2Jason balls
Jason carries Jason balls
Jason carries x balls

Substituting ""x = 1"" for Jeffrey's case into the relationship, we find that:

Jason carries 1 ball
Jordan carries 2 * Jason balls = 2 * 1 = 2 balls

Step 5: The number of balls that Coach brought to the practice is equal to the total number of balls carried by all three boys in one trip.

Total number of balls = 3 * x (since there are 3 boys)

From the problem, we know that Jason carried 2 balls during the practice, so we can find the number of balls carried by each boy and eventually, the number of balls Coach brought to practice.

x = Jason's balls = 2
Jason carries 2 balls
Jordan carries 2 * Jason balls = 2 * 2 = 4 balls

Since the three boys carried all the balls in one trip, we can calculate the total number of balls Coach brought to the practice:

Total number of balls = 3 * x
Total number of balls = 3 * 2
Total number of balls = 6

So, {The final answer is 6.} The coach brought 6 basketballs to practice.</s>","Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 balls.

1. We know that the pirates dug ten holes on the first day, thirteen holes on the second day, and eight holes on the third day. So in total, they dug 10 + 13 + 8 = <<10+13+8=21>>21 holes before finding the treasure.
2. The island had four times as many holes at the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. We'll call the number of holes at the end of the first day ""x"", so at the end of the third day, there were 4x holes.
3. Since the pirates dug 21 holes before finding the treasure, and there were 4x holes when they stopped digging for the day on the third day, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is 4x - 21.

Therefore, the answer is: The pirates dug {4x - 21} holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

But we don't have a value for x (the number of holes at the end of the first day) in the problem, so we can't find the exact number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day. We would need more information to solve the problem completely.</s>","Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.
The island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.
They dug 10 + 13 + 8 = <<10+13+8=31>>31 holes the first three days.
After filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.
When they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.
Thus, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes on the fourth day.

1. Amora and Lainey get equal shares of chips, which is 70 chips each.
2. The total number of chips for two equal shares is 2 * 70 = 140 chips.
3. Collins should get an equal share plus 15 chips more. So, Collins gets 140 + 15 = 155 chips.

1. Jen is traveling to 3 different countries.
2. He has to pay $400 in total for supplies.
3. The tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies.

Let's represent the cost of travel as X. We know that:

Supplies cost = $400
Travel cost = X
Travel cost is 50% more than supplies cost

We can set up an equation to solve for X:

X = $400 + ($400 * 0.5)

Now, we just need to solve for X:

X = $400 + ($400 * 0.5)
X = $400 + $200
X = $600

{The final answer is $600}</s>","He pays 400*.5=$<<400*.5=200>>200 more for tickets than supplies

                 [/INST] Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan, so the number of Pokemon Stan has caught can be found by subtracting 5 from the number of Pokemon Alex has caught. It is given that Alex has caught 339 - x, where x is the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
2. Stanley has caught 13 less than 4 times the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught. Mathematically, this can be represented as: 4a - 13 = x, where a is the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.
3. We know that the total number of Pokemon they have caught together is 339, so: 339 = Alex's count + Stan's count + Adelwolfe's count.
4. Substitute the expressions for Alex's count and Adelwolfe's count in terms of Stan's count from steps 1 and 2 into the equation in step 3. This will give us: 339 = (339 - x) + x + a
5. Simplifying the equation, we get: 339 = 2x + a
6. Since Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan, it means that Stan has caught 5 fewer Pokemon than Alex. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is x = 339 - a/2. However, a is not directly given in the question and appears only as a part of the equation.

I'm unable to provide a definitive answer in the given problem since the variable 'a' is undetermined. We would need more information to solve for Stan's count.

We have the following variables and their relationships:

- Number of episodes (x)
- Duration of each episode (20 minutes)

We're trying to find the total duration that John will spend watching the show.

Step 2: Determine the number of episodes based on the total minutes.
We're given that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. That is:

x = minutes per episode / 2

Substituting the known value 20 minutes per episode, we have:

x = 20 minutes / 2
x = 10 episodes

Step 3: Calculate the total minutes John will spend watching the entire show.
Given that there are x episodes, and each lasts 20 minutes, John's total viewing time will be:

total minutes = x * minutes per episode
total minutes = 10 * 20 minutes

First, let's find out how many hours the bird spent flying south in total:
1. The bird flew south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. Distance = Speed * Time
Distance_1 = 10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

2. The bird flew south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour.
Distance_2 = 5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Now, the bird flew north for 2 hours, but we don't have enough information to calculate the exact distance because we don't know the distance between the northern and southern homes.

However, we can find the total distance the bird traveled during the entire journey:
Total Distance = Distance_1 + Distance_2
Total Distance = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

{The final answer is 410 miles}.</s>","Flying for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, the bird travels 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 miles in a southerly direction.

Step 1: Greta made a batch of one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, so she had 12 brownies.
Step 2: At her office, they sent her home with half a dozen brownies, so she had an additional 6 brownies.
Step 3: When she arrived home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies (which is equal to 48 brownies) waiting.
Step 4: During the party, one and a half dozen (which is equal to 18) brownies were eaten.

Now, let's find out how many brownies Greta had in total and how many were left over:

Total brownies Greta had = Brownies she made + Brownies sent from the office + Brownies from the surprise party
Total brownies Greta had = 12 + 6 + (48 - 18)
Total brownies Greta had = 12 + 6 + 24
Total brownies Greta had = 32

So, the final answer is: Greta had 32 brownies in total and had 20 brownies left over from the entire day.</s>","Her office sent her home with a 1/2 dozen brownies so she had 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 individual brownies

She made 1 dozen brownies and had 2.5 dozen left from the party so 1+2.5 = <<1+2.5=3.5>>3.5 dozen brownies
Every dozen is 12 and she has 3.5 dozen so she has 12*3.5 = <<12*3.5=42>>42 individuals brownies

The total age of all three family members is the sum of Nani's age, his brother's age, and his sister's age:

Total age = x + 2x + 0.75x

Simplifying the equation:

Total age = 3.75x

So, for example, if Nani is 20 years old, then the total age of the family would be 3.75 * 20 = 75 years.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. Each box contains 20 oranges. So, she bought a total of 12 * 20 = <<12*20=240>>240 oranges.

Step 2: She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. So, she gave away 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 oranges.

Step 3: She kept 1/4 of the oranges for herself. So, she kept 240 * 1/4 = <<240*0.25=60>>60 oranges.

Step 4: To find out how many oranges she sold, we need to subtract the number of oranges she kept and gave away from the total number of oranges she bought. So, the number of oranges she sold is 240 - 40 - 60 = <<240-40-60=140>>140 oranges.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of states in the USA as ""u"". Since India has 4 more states than half the number of states in the USA, we can express the number of states in India as ""u + 2u/2"" or ""3u/2"".

First, let's find the number of states in India: {India has 4 more states than half the number of states in the USA, so India has 3u/2 states and the USA has u states.}.

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries, we simply add the number of states in India and the USA:

Total number of states = States in India + States in USA
= (3u/2) + u
= (3u + 2u) / 2
= 5u / 2

{The final answer is: Both India and the USA together have 5u/2 = 5(u/2) = 5 * (number of states in the USA) / 2 states.}

So, the total number of states in India and the USA is 5 * (number of states in the USA) / 2.

For example, if the USA has 50 states, India has 4 more, so India would have 52 states, and the total number of states in both countries would be:
5 * (number of states in the USA) / 2 = 5 * 50 / 2 = 125 states.</s>","Since the number of states in the USA is 50, half that number is 1/2*50 = 25
Since there are 4 more than half the number of states in the USA in India, there are 25+4 = <<4+25=29>>29 states in India.
Together, the two countries have 50+29 = <<50+29=79>>79 states.

Step 1: Find the total cost of the books.
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Step 2: Calculate how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books.

Hours worked = Total cost / Hourly earnings

Hours worked = $39 / $5/hour

Hours worked ≈ $39 / $5 = 7.8 hours

Since Tyler cannot work a fraction of an hour, he would need to work at least 8 hours to afford all three books.

{The final answer is: Tyler needs to work 8 hours to afford all three books.}</s>","Tyler wants to purchase books that cost $18 + $13 + $8 = $<<18+13+8=39>>39.

                    question:
                    Richard, ? Jerry, ; and : Robert are ! going ? to share 60 ? cherries. : If Robert has 30 cherries, and has : 10 more than ? Richard, , how : many more cherries . does Robert ! have : than , Jerry?
                 [/INST] let's first assign variables to represent the number of cherries each person has:
let R = number of cherries Richard has
let J = number of cherries Jerry has
let C = number of cherries Robert has

We are given that:
1. R + J + C = 60 (Total number of cherries)
2. C = R +10 (Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard)

Substitute the second equation into the first one:
R + J + (R+10) = 60

Combine like terms:
2R + J + 10 = 60

Subtract 10 from both sides:
2R + J = 50

Now we need to find the difference between the number of cherries Robert and Jerry have.

C = R + 10

So the difference between Robert and Jerry is:
C - J = (R + 10) - J

Now, substitute J = (60 - 2R)/2 from the first equation:

C - J = (R + 10 - (60 - 2R)/2)

Simplifying the equation:

C - J = (2R + 10 - 60 + 2R)/2

Combining terms:
C - J = (4R + 10)/2

Now we have the difference in terms of R. To find the actual difference we need to know the value of R. To do that, we need to solve for R from the first equation:

R + J + C = 60
R + J + (R + 10) = 60
2R + J + 10 = 60
2R + J = 50

Now we can use the quadratic formula to find the two possible solutions for R:

R = (50 - J)/2  or  R = (50 + J)/2

Since we know R < C, we can discard the solution with the smaller R value.

So, R = (50 + J)/2

Now we can find the difference between Robert and Jerry

C - J = (4R + 10)/2
C - J = (4 * ((50+J)/2) + 10)/2

To solve for J, we need to get rid of the radical sign:

C - J = (200 + 2J + 10)/2

Multiplying both numerator and denominator by 2:

C - J = (402 + 2J)/2

Now we can solve for J:

C - J = (402 + 2J)/2
2(C - J) = 402 + 2J
2C - 2J = 402

Subtract 2C from both sides:

-2J = 402 - 2C

Now, divide both sides by -2:

J = -(201 + C)/2

Now we can find the number of cherries Jerry has:
J = -(201 + C)/2
J = -(201 + (R+10))/2
J = -(201 + R + 10)/2

Substituting R in terms of J that we found earlier:

J = -(201 + R + 10)/2

Squaring both sides:

J^2 = 40401 + 2RJ + R^2 + 2100 + 100

Now we have a quadratic equation in terms of R and J:

J^2 - 2RJ - 40391 = 0

To find one possible solution for R, we can use the quadratic formula:

R = [ -J^2 ± sqrt(J^4 + 4*(-40391)*1) ] / 2

We know R < C, so the solution with the smaller R value is valid. Unfortunately, calculating the square root of a large number like the one in this equation is impractical. 

To get a more realistic answer, we can make some assumptions about J's value:

For example, if we assume J = 10, then the equation becomes:

","Since Robert has 30, then 60 - 30 = <<30=30>>30 cherries are left to be shared by Richard and Jerry.
Richard has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 cherries since Robert has 10 more cherries than him.
Jerry has 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 cherries.
So Robert has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 more cherries than Jerry.

                    question:
                    , Sunny is ; selling . gingerbread and ? apple ! pie ; for a , fundraiser. On Saturday, he : sold ? 10 boxes ? of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of : apple pie, . than , on Sunday. : On ! Sunday, ? he sold ! 5 ; more boxes ; of gingerbread than on Saturday ! and . 15 ? boxes ! of , apple pie. ; If the gingerbread ! cost $6 and the , apple ; pie : cost $15, ; how much did Sunny earn for . two . days?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's first find out how many boxes of gingerbread Sunny sold on each day.
- On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes less of apple pie than on Sunday, and he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread. So, let x be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday. Then x - 4 is the number of boxes sold on Saturday. Therefore, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday is x + 5.

Step 2: Now let's find the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- We know that Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday than on Saturday. So x + 5 > x. Solving this inequality, we have x > 5.
- Since the number of boxes cannot be negative, the minimum value of x is 5. So, Sunny sold at least 5 boxes of apple pie on Sunday.
- We're also told that Sunny sold 10 boxes fewer of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday. So x - 4 < x. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we have x > 5. Again, since the number of boxes cannot be negative, the minimum value of x is 5.
- Therefore, Sunny sold exactly 5 boxes of apple pie on Sunday.
- With 5 boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday, Sunny sold x + 5 = x + 5 boxes of gingerbread on that day.

Step 3: Now let's find out how many boxes of gingerbread Sunny sold on Saturday.
- With 5 boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday, Sunny sold x + 5 = x + 5 - 4 = x + 1 boxes of gingerbread on that day.
- Since Sunny sold 10 boxes fewer of apple pie on Saturday, he sold x - 4 boxes on that day.

Step 4: Let's calculate the number of boxes for each type of dessert Sunny sold on each day.
- On Saturday: gingerbread = x + 1, apple pie = x - 4
- On Sunday: gingerbread = x + 5, apple pie = 5

Step 5: Let's calculate the revenue for each type of dessert Sunny earned on each day.
- On Saturday: gingerbread revenue = (x + 1) * $6, apple pie revenue = (x - 4) * $15
- On Sunday: gingerbread revenue = (x + 5) * $6, apple pie revenue = 5 * $15

Step 6: Let's calculate Sunny's total revenue for both days.
Total revenue = gingerbread revenue on Saturday + gingerbread revenue on Sunday + apple pie revenue on Saturday + apple pie revenue on Sunday

Step 7: Plug in the expressions from Step 5 into the equation from Step 6.
Total revenue = [(x + 1) * $6] + [(x + 5) * $6] + [(x - 4) * $15] + [5 * $15]

Step 8: Simplify the equation from Step 7.
Total revenue = 6(x + 1) + 6(x + 5) + 15(x - 4) + 15(5)

Step 9: Apply the distributive property of multiplication.
Total revenue = 6x + 6+ 6x + 30+ 15x - 60+ 75

Step 10: Combine like terms.
Total revenue = 17x - 22

{The final answer is $17x - $22} This does not represent a specific amount, since x (the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday) is unknown. To find the exact revenue, you should determine the value of x first.</s>","He sold 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.
The total number of boxes of gingerbread that Sunny sold is 10 + 15 = <<10+15=25>>25.
Sunny earned 25 x $6 = $<<25*6=150>>150 for selling gingerbread.
He sold 15 - 4 = <<15-4=11>>11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.
The total number of boxes of apple pie that Sunny sold is 15 + 11 = <<15+11=26>>26.
He earned 26 x $15 = $<<26*15=390>>390 for selling apple pie.
So, Sunny earned $150 + $390 = $<<150+390=540>>540 for two days.

Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour, and one bottle contains 8 ounces.So we can calculate how many hours she can get from one bottle.
Hours from one bottle = Total ounces in the bottle / Ounces used per hour
= 8 ounces / 1 ounce/hour

Step 2: Calculate how many bottles she needs for 4 hours of sun exposure each day.
Bottles needed per day = Hours of sun exposure per day / Hours from one bottle
= 4 hours / 8 hours/bottle
= 0.5 bottles/day

Step 3: Calculate how many bottles she needs for 8 days of sun exposure.
Bottles needed in total = Bottles needed per day * Days
= 0.5 bottles/day * 8 days
= 4 bottles

The final answer is: Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.</s>","She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days so that's 4*8 = <<4*8=32>>32 hours

1. The blue car costs $100.
2. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, so we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:
   Red car price = Blue car price - (Blue car price * 0.4)
   Red car price = $100 - ($100 * 0.4)
   Red car price = $100 - $40
   Red car price = $60

3. Now that we know the price of the red car, we can find the total cost of both cars:
   Total cost = Blue car price + Red car price
   Total cost = $100 + $60
   Total cost = $160

{The final answer is: Both cars cost a total of $160.}</s>","The red car is 40/100 * 100 = $<<40/100*100=40>>40 cheaper than the blue car.

1. We know that Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, his father will be half of his father's age at that time, and Emil will be twice as old as his brother.

Let's represent the age of Emil's father as X, and the age of his brother as Y.

3. According to the problem, when Emil is 24, his father will be half his age, so X = 24 - (1/2)(24).
4. And when Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so Y = 24/2.

Solving for X:
X = 24 - (1/2)(24)
X = 24 - 12
X = 12 * 1 + 12 * (-1/2)
X = 12 + 12 * (-0.5)
X = 12 + 6
X = 18 {Emil's father is 18 years old}

Solving for Y:
Y = 24/2
Y = 12

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught the same amount, 3 pounds, 4 times. So, he caught a total of:

3 pounds * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 pounds of crawfish on Friday.

On Saturday, he caught half of his Friday's catch, which is:

12 pounds / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pounds of crawfish.

The given information states that 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds. Since Joe had 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday and 12 pounds on Friday, we can calculate the number of servings made for those two days:

Thursday: 3 pounds = 1 serving
Friday: 12 pounds = 4 servings

Saturday's catch, 6 pounds, can make 2 servings:

So, in total, Joe had:

Servings from Thursday = 1
Servings from Friday = 4

20% of 30 students = 0.2 * 30 = 6 students
So, there are 6 football players in the class.

Step 2: Find the number of students remaining after accounting for football players.
Total students = 30, Football players = 6
Remaining students = Total students - Football players = 30 - 6 = 24 students

Step 3: Find the number of cheerleaders in the class.
25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students
So, there are 6 cheerleaders in the class.

Step 4: Find the number of students in the band.
Since the problem does not provide information about the number of students in the band, we cannot determine this value.

Step 5: Find the number of students leaving early for an away game.
Since the problem does not provide information about how many students are in each of the three groups (football players, cheerleaders, or band), and how many students from each group will be leaving early, we cannot determine the exact number of students leaving early.

Therefore, we cannot provide a final answer to this problem as more information is needed.

                 [/INST] To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots and then find the average of that and Sophie's size five boots.

Given that Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's size five boots, we can represent this as:

Charlie's boot size = 5 * Sophie's boot size

Substituting Sophie's boot size as 5:

Charlie's boot size = 5 * 5 = 25

Therefore, Charlie wears boots that are a size 25.

To calculate the average size of their shoes, we add the sizes of both their shoes and divide by 2:

Average shoe size = (Charlie's boot size + Sophie's boot size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30.5

{The final answer is: The average size of shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 30.5.}</s>","If Sophie wears size five shoes, Charlie wears 5 * shoe size 5 = shoe size <<5*5=25>>25

Step 1: Calculate the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed.
Given that each plant requires 1.5 feet of space and the flower bed is 111 feet long, we can calculate the number of plants as follows:

Number of plants = Total length of flower bed / Length of space between each plant
Number of plants = 111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = 74.07 ≈ 75 plants

Pat currently owns 17 plants, so she needs to buy an additional:
Number of plants needed = Total number of plants - Current number of plants = 75 - 17 = 58

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of buying all the required plants.
Each plant costs $6, so the total cost would be:

Total cost = Number of plants needed * Cost per plant = 58 plants * $6/plant = $352

{The final answer is $352}</s>","Pat's flower bed is 111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = <<111/1.5=74>>74 plants needed.

First, let's find the number of petunias and sweet potato vines for each basket:
- Each basket will have 3 petunias, so the number of petunias is 3.
- Each basket will also have 2 sweet potato vines, so the number of sweet potato vines is 2.

Next, let's find the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines for one basket:
- The cost of petunias is $3.00 per petunia, so the cost of 3 petunias is 3 * $3.00 = $<<3*3=9>>9.
- The cost of sweet potato vines is $2.50 per vine, so the cost of 2 sweet potato vines is 2 * $2.50 = $<<2*2.5=5>>5.

And now let's find the total cost of filling one basket:
- The total cost of one basket is the cost of petunias plus the cost of sweet potato vines: $9 + $5 = $<<9+5=14>>14.

Finally, to find the total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets, we just need to multiply the cost of one basket by the number of baskets:

To find her peeling rate per minute, we can use the given information:

- Emily can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute.

Thus, her peeling rate is 6 shrimp per minute.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Given:
- She can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.

To find her cooking rate per minute, we'll divide the number of shrimp she can cook in a minute:

- Cooking rate = Shrimp cooked / Minutes
- Cooking rate = 30 shrimp / 10 minutes
- Cooking rate = 3 shrimp per minute

Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we'll find out how many minutes it takes her to peel all 90 shrimp:

- Time to peel = Number of shrimp / Peeling rate
- Time to peel = 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute
- Time to peel = 15 minutes

Finally, since it takes her 1 minute to peel each set of 6 shrimp, she needs an extra minute for other tasks like rinsing the shrimp, preparing ingredients, or setting up a cooktop.

So, the grand total of time it takes her to peel and cook 90 shrimp is:

{The final answer is}: 16 minutes (15 minutes for peeling and cooking + 1 minute for other tasks)</s>","First find how long it takes Emily to peel the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes

1. The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees in 1 hour on low. So, in 3 hours, it cools the room by 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees. The room's temperature without the air conditioner is S - 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = S - 4 degrees.
2. The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees per hour on high. In 4 hours, it cools the room by 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.
3. After turning off the air conditioner, the room warms up by 2 degrees per hour. In 2 hours, it warms up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.
4. Therefore, the final temperature is the initial temperature after cooling on low for 3 hours (S - 6 degrees), then cooling on high for 4 hours (S - 12 degrees + 12 degrees), and finally warming up while the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours (S - 12 degrees + 4 degrees).

Bill's father saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. So, the year his father saw the Comet was 1951 (C-25 = 1951).

Bill saw the Comet for the first time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill was 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time (3 * 30 = 90). Using this information, we can calculate the year Bill saw the Comet for the first time, as follows:

C - (Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time) = The year Bill saw the Comet for the first time
C - 90 = Year Bill saw the Comet for the first time

Therefore, the year Bill saw the Comet for the first time was 1921 (C-90 = 1921).

The final answer is: Bill was 60 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time (Bill was 30 when his father saw it, and 3 * 30 = 90, so Bill was 90 - 30 = 60), and he saw it for the first time when he was 71 years old (C-71 = 1949).

How many flights ! to France ? does . the ; first ; plane ? take in ; one day?
                 [/INST] To find out how many flights the first plane takes to France in one day, we need to first find out the total number of flights the first plane makes every day, as well as the number of flights it makes to Greece. Then we can subtract the number of flights to Greece and Poland to find the number of flights to France.

1. The first plane makes N flights per day.
2. It goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, which is N x 3/4 = 3N/4 flights.
3. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. Since there are two destinations and the number of flights to one destination is half the number of flights to the other, we know that the number of flights to Greece, Poland, France, and Germany are in the ratio 3:1:1:1.
4. Since the number of flights to Greece is 3N/4, the number of flights to Poland is N/4, and since the other half of the flights go to France and Germany, the number of flights to each of France and Germany is N/4.
5. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is 3N/4 + N/4 + N/4 = N flights.
6. Now, we know that the number of flights to Poland is N/4, and since these flights are less than the number of flights to France, the number of flights to France must be greater than N/4.
7. However, we also know that the number of flights to Greece and Poland together is less than half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. That is: 3N/4 + N/4 <= N/2
8. Solving this inequality, we get N > 8, since for N = 8, the left side of the inequality would be equal to the right side, but we know that the number of flights to Greece is strictly greater than N/2.
9. Therefore, N must be greater than 8. For example, if N = 12, we would have 3N/4 = 9, N/4 = 3, and N/2 = 6. The number of flights to Greece would be 9, to Poland 3, and since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, each of these destinations would receive 4 flights (N/4). Therefore, the first plane takes 4 flights to France in one day.

{The final answer is: The first plane takes 4 flights to France in one day.}</s>","The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = <<44*2=88>>88 flights a day.
If 3/4 of the first plane’s flights are to Greece, then flights to France or Germany make up 1 – 3/4 = 1/4 of the total daily flights.
Therefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 flights to France or Germany.
Splitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 flights to France in one day.

Adam bought new trousers for a certain amount. His mother gave him $6 for this purpose, and his father gave him twice as much. The question asks for how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings.

Step 2: Extract the given information
1. Adam spent $30 on new trousers.
2. His mother gave him $6.
3. His father gave him an amount equal to $6 × 2.

Step 3: Calculate the amount given by father
Father gave $6 × 2 = $12

Step 4: Find the total amount spent on trousers
Total amount spent = $30 (by Adam) + $6 (by mother) + $12 (by father)

Step 5: Find the amount contributed by Adam
Total amount spent = $30 (by Adam) + $6 (by mother) + $12 (by father)
Total amount spent = $52

Amount contributed by Adam = Total amount spent - Amount spent by others
Amount contributed by Adam = $52 - ($6 + $12) = $52 - $18 = $34. Therefore, {The final answer is $34}. Adam had to contribute $34 from his savings.</s>","Adam's father gave him $6 * 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.

                 [/INST] To find the age of Wilfred, let's follow these steps:

1. The total age of the four children is 20. So, we need to find the ages of Akbar (3 years), Alessandro (4 years), and Helene:

   The ages of Akbar and Alessandro are given as 3 and 4 years respectively, so we need to find the age of Helene.

2. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. We know the total age of the group is 20, and there are four children (including Helene), so the average age is:
    Average age = Total age / Number of children
    Average age = 20 / 4 = 5

3. Helene is twice as old as the average age:
    Helene's age = 2 × Average age
    Helene's age = 2 × 5
    Helene's age = 10

4. Now we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene. Let's see if the given information is consistent:
    Total age = Age of Akbar + Age of Alessandro + Age of Helene
    20 = 3 + 4 + Helene's age
    20 = 7 + Helene's age
    13 = Helene's age

5. We found that Helene's age is 13, but we previously calculated it to be 10. The information provided in the question seems inconsistent.

6. Since the information provided in the question is inconsistent, we cannot find the age of Wilfred using the given information.

Therefore, the final answer is: Unable to determine the age of Wilfred with the given information.</s>","If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.
Helene is twice as old as the group's average age, meaning Helene is 2 * 5 years = <<2*5=10>>10 years old.
The total age of the three children is 10 years + 3 years + 4 years = <<10+3+4=17>>17 years.
Wilfred's age is 20 years - 17 years = <<20-17=3>>3 years.

1. Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
2. Walter collects $1500 from an online fund.
3. Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates.
4. Walter will only tell his lawyer about the neighbors' donations and the online fund after his friend gives him an additional $200.

To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we first need to determine the total amount that Walter has collected so far from both sources.

Total amount collected = $500 (from neighbors) + $1500 (from online fund)
Total amount collected = $2000

Since Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else, we need to find out how much everyone else has donated in total, and then multiply that amount by three to find the lawyer's contribution.

However, we do not have enough information to determine the total amount donated by everyone else except for Walter. Therefore, we cannot find the exact amount that Walter's lawyer is going to contribute.

The final answer is: We cannot determine the exact amount that Walter's lawyer is going to contribute without knowing the total amount donated by everyone else.</s>","Walter collects $500 + $1500 + $200 = $<<500+1500+200=2200>>2,200 he collects from everyone for charity.

Step 2: Find out how many cookies were given to the church next door.

Step 3: Find out how many people in the church next door received cookies.
Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we need to find out how many people this equals. We do this by dividing the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. So, 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = <<750/15=50>>50 people.

                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many slices each adult and each kid will get.

Each kid gets one slice. Therefore, the total number of slices for the kids is 4.
Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as a kid's slice. So, each adult gets 2 slices.

Therefore, the family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) will get a total of 2 * 2 + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 slices from the watermelon.

Now, to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we first need to find out the total amount of watermelon consumed by the adults. Since each adult gets 2 slices, the total amount of watermelon for the adults is 2 slices/adult * 2 adults = 4 slices.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we'll divide the amount of watermelon they get by the total amount of watermelon in the watermelon. Since each slice is an undetermined amount of watermelon, let's assume 1 unit of watermelon is equal to 1 slice for simplicity.

Percentage of watermelon for each adult = (Amount of watermelon for each adult / Total amount of watermelon) * 100%
= (Number of slices for each adult / Total number of slices) * 100%
= (2 slices/adult * 2 adults) / (10 slices) * 100%
= 4 slices / 10 slices * 100%
= 40%

Therefore, each adult gets 40% of the watermelon.

{The final answer is: Each adult gets 40% of the watermelon.}</s>","Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.
Since each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon
So the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage
The percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)
x = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic on Mondays.
2. He has to do rounds for inpatients and takes 20 minutes per inpatient.
3. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes.

First, let's calculate the time Doctor Jones spends on doing rounds. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and he spends 20 minutes per inpatient, we can find out how many inpatients he can visit per hour.

20 minutes/inpatient / 60 minutes/hour = 1/3 inpatients/hour

So, to find the total time it takes for Doctor Jones to do rounds for all his inpatients, we multiply the number of inpatients by the time it takes to do rounds for one inpatient.

Total time for rounds = Number of inpatients * Time per inpatient

Now, let's calculate the time Doctor Jones spends on appointments. Since each appointment takes 30 minutes, we can find out how many appointments he can do per hour.

30 minutes/appointment / 60 minutes/hour = 1/2 appointments/hour

So, to find the total time it takes for Doctor Jones to complete all of his appointments, we multiply the number of appointments by the time per appointment.

Total time for appointments = Number of appointments * Time per appointment

Finally, to find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we first find the total time Doctor Jones spends at the clinic, then subtract the time for rounds and appointments from that total.

Total time at the clinic = 9 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 540 minutes

Total time for rounds = Number of inpatients * Time per inpatient
= 9 inpatients * (20 minutes/inpatient / 60 minutes/hour) * 60 minutes/hour
= 9 inpatients * (1/3) * 60
= 30 inpatients * 60
= 1800 minutes

Total time for appointments = Number of appointments * Time per appointment
= 10 appointments * (1/2) * 60
= 10 appointments * 30
= 300 minutes

Total time for records update = Total time at the clinic - Total time for rounds - Total time for appointments
= 540 minutes - 1800 minutes - 300 minutes
= -2160 minutes

The result contains a negative value, which doesn't make sense in this context. It seems that the number of inpatients or appointments provided is incorrect and needs to be adjusted to allow Doctor Jones enough time to update his records within the given time constraints.

{The final answer is: The current number of inpatients (or appointments) is incorrect, and it needs to be adjusted.}</s>","Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients, so his rounds will take 9 * 20 = <<9*20=180>>180 minutes.
He has ten appointments, which will take 10 * 30 = <<10*30=300>>300 minutes.
The rounds and appointments will take 180 + 300 = <<180+300=480>>480 minutes total.
An hour is 60 minutes, so rounds and appointments will take 480 / 60 = <<480/60=8>>8 hours.
Doctor Jones will have 9 - 8 = <<9-8=1>>1 hour left to update his records.

1. Making the cake batter: It takes 20 minutes to make the batter.
2. Baking the cake: It takes 30 minutes to bake the cake.
3. Cooling the cake: It requires 2 hours to cool.
4. Frosting the cake: It requires an additional 10 minutes to frost the cake.

Now, let's calculate the total time it takes to make the cake, from start to finish:

Total time = Time to make batter + Time to bake + Time to cool + Time to frost
Total time = 20 minutes + 30 minutes + 2 hours + 10 minutes
Total time = 2 hours 50 minutes

To find the latest time that Jordan can start making the cake to serve it at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time it takes to make the cake from the desired serving time:

5:00 pm - Total time = Starting time
5:00 pm - 2 hours 50 minutes = Starting time
5:00 pm - 165 minutes = Starting time
5:00 pm - 165 minutes = 3:35 pm

{The final answer is: Jordan can start making the cake at 3:35 pm to serve it at 5:00 pm.}</s>","1 hour is 60 minutes so we know that 2 hours to cool the cake is the same as 2*60 so <<2*60=120>>120 min
It will take Jordan 20 min to make the batter, 30 to bake, 120 to cool and 10 to frost so the cake will take 20 +30 +120 +10 = <<20+30+120+10=180>>180 minutes total
Jordan needs to convert 180 minutes to hours so 180/60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours
If the cake needs to be finished by 5:00 pm and it will take 3 hours total to make then 5-3 = <<5-3=2>>2:00 pm is the latest she can start making the cake

                    Lisa and Peter , are selling chocolate bars door : to door. Lisa , sold ? three : and ; a half boxes of ; chocolate . bars, : and ? Peter , sold four and ! a half boxes. They sold : 64 chocolate , bars ! together. . How many . chocolate ! bars are , in ! a ! box?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as x. We know that Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars she sold is 3.5x. We also know that Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars he sold is 4.5x.

The total number of chocolate bars they sold together is given as 64. So we have the equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

To solve for x, we can combine the terms with x:

7.5x = 64

Now, to find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 7.5:

x = 64 / 7.5

We can simplify the fraction to get an exact answer:

x = 8.57143 (approximately)

However, since the problem states that we need to find the number of chocolate bars in a box, it's more reasonable to assume that this number is a whole number. In that case, this problem has no solution with the given information.

Therefore, the problem as stated is inconsistent, and no definitive answer can be given with the information provided.

Final answer: There isn't a definitive answer to this problem as stated.</s>","Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.
Lisa sold 3 1/2 * B bars.
Peter sold 4 1/2 * B bars.
Together, they sold 3 1/2 * B + 4 1/2 * B = 8B = 64 bars.
Therefore, there are B = 64 / 8 = <<64/8=8>>8 chocolate bars in a box.

                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many lessons the dance studio offers per week, given that there are 10 students and it is rented 3 days a week.

1. There are 10 students and each student attends a lesson. So, the number of lessons offered per week is 10.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of renting the studio per week.

2. The cost to rent the studio is $25 per session, and there are 3 sessions per week. So, the weekly rent cost is 25 * 3 = $75.

Now, let's find out how much the studio earns per week from student participation fees.

3. The cost per student per session is $25 + $1.50 = $26.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly earnings from student participation fees are 10 * $26.50 = $265.

Finally, to find the monthly earnings, we need to multiply the weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a month. Since there are approximately 4.33 weeks in a month (considering an average month has around 4.33 weeks of 7 days each), we get:

4. Monthly earnings = Weekly earnings * Weeks per month ≈ $265 * 4.33 ≈ $1118.45

{The final answer is $1118.45}</s>","The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.
So the total earnings per session is $15 + $25 = $<<15+25=40>>40.
Thus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.
Therefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box that Peter and Martha have as ""x."" We are given the following information:

1. Peter has 4 boxes with x chocolate bars each.
2. Martha has 7 boxes with x chocolate bars each.
3. Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars.
4. Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars.

We can set up a system of linear equations to find the value of x:

1. Peter has 4x (number of boxes) * x (number of bars in each box) = 64
2. Martha has 7x (number of boxes) * x (number of bars in each box) = 56

To solve the system of equations, we'll proceed as follows:

Step 1: Solve the equation for Peter's total chocolate bars for x: 4x * x = 64

Step 2: Take the square root of both sides to find the possible value of x: x = sqrt(16*64) = 4*sqrt(16) = 8.

But since Martha has fewer boxes, her bars in each box have to be greater than Peter's for her total to be less. So, x is not equal to 8.

Step 3: Solve the equation for Martha's total chocolate bars for x: 7x * x = 56

Step 4: Divide both sides by x: 7x = 56

Step 5: Divide both sides by 7: x = 56 / 7

x ≈ 8.06, but not a whole number of chocolate bars. Since we cannot have a fractional number of chocolate bars, we need to go back and adjust the number of boxes in one of the equations.

Now let's assume Peter has 5 boxes instead of 4:

1. Peter has 5x (number of boxes) * x (number of bars in each box) = 64
2. Martha has 7x (number of boxes) * x (number of bars in each box) = 56

Step 6: Solve the equation for Peter's total chocolate bars for x: 5x * x = 64

Step 7: Take the square root of both sides to find the possible value of x: x = sqrt(25*64) = 5*sqrt(25) = 10.

Since this gives us a feasible solution for the given information.

Step 8: Compare the number of chocolate bars in one box for Peter and Martha:

- Peter: 10
- Martha: x

Step 9: Determine the difference:

Peter has (10 - x) more chocolate bars in one box than Martha.

We found that x = 8.06, but that wasn't a feasible solution. Since Peter has 5 boxes instead, x must be a number that can be multiplied by 5 and 7 to obtain the given totals. Hence, x = 10, and Peter has (10 - 8) = 2 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

{The final answer is: Peter has 2 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.}</s>","Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 equal boxes so there are 64/4 = <<64/4=16>>16 bars in each box

Peter has 16-8 = <<16-8=8>>8 bars more than Martha in each box

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool
The formula to find the volume of a rectangle prism (like a pool) is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height

Given that the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.
Substitute the values into the formula:
Volume = 14 ft * 25 ft * 4 ft

Step 2: Calculate the volume of the pool
Volume = 14 ft * 25 ft * 4 ft
Volume = 1,170 cubic feet

Step 3: Find the number of gallons in a cubic foot (since the cost is given in gallons)
We know that 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons.

Step 4: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons
Gallons = Volume * Conversion Factor
Gallons = 1,170 cubic ft * 7.48 gallons/cubic ft
Gallons = 8,765.8 gallons

Step 5: Calculate the cost to fill the pool
Cost = Volume * Cost per gallon

Bethany runs 10 laps in one hour. {We'll denote the number of laps Bethany runs as B.}

Now, let's find out how many laps Trey can run in one hour. We know Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany:

Trey runs B + 4 laps in one hour. {Let's denote the number of laps Trey runs as T.}

Next, let's find out how many laps Shaelyn can run in one hour. We know she can run half as many laps as Trey:

Shaelyn runs T/2 laps in one hour. {Let's denote the number of laps Shaelyn runs as S.}

Since we want to compare the number of laps Bethany can run to the number of laps Quinn can run, let's express the number of laps Quinn runs in terms of Bethany's:

Quinn runs S - 2 laps in one hour. {We know Quinn runs 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.}

Finally, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we just need to subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

Bethany runs B laps in one hour, and Quinn runs B + (S - 2) laps in one hour.

Bethany can run {B - (B + (S - 2))} more laps than Quinn.

To find this difference, we'll first get the value of S in terms of B:

S = T/2
 S = (B + 4)/2 {Since T = B + 4}

Now, we can find the value of the difference between the number of laps Bethany and Quinn can run in one hour:

Bethany runs B laps in one hour.
Quinn runs (B + (S - 2)) laps in one hour, where S = (B + 4)/2.

Bethany can run {B - (B + (B + 4 - 2)/2)} more laps than Quinn.

How many gallons ! of water are ? remaining for the ! tank to be : full?
                 [/INST] To find out how many gallons of water are remaining in the tank to be filled, we first need to calculate the number of gallons pumped by both Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day:
- Wanda pumped 1/4 of the tank's capacity: 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons
- Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda pumped: 3/4 * 4500 = 6750 gallons

So on the first day, they pumped a total of 4500 + 6750 = 11,250 gallons.

On the second day:
- Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day: 2/3 * 4500 = 6000 gallons
- Ms. B pumped 1/3 of what she pumped on the first day: 1/3 * 6750 = 2250 gallons

So on the second day, they pumped a total of 6000 + 2250 = 8250 gallons.

In total, they pumped 11,250 + 8250 = 19,500 gallons of water.

The tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, so they have pumped 19,500 > 18000 gallons in two days, which is not enough to fill the tank.

{The final answer is: They cannot fill the tank with the given amount of water.}</s>","On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.
On the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.
They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons
Ms. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons
Together, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons
In the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = <<4125+7875=12000>>12000 gallons
The amount of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = <<18000-12000=6000>>6000 gallons

What ; was ; the ! charge of the power bank when ! Maria went out to the . park?
                 [/INST] To find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we first need to determine how long the power bank took to charge to 28% and how much capacity it had initially.

Let's call the initial charge of the power bank x. After charging for a certain number of hours h1, the power bank was at 28% charge. Therefore, we can write an equation describing the relationship between x and h1:

x * (1 - 0.28) = x * (1 - 0.09)^h1 for h1 in [0, 5] (since the power bank lost 9% per hour for the first 5 hours).

Solving for x, we get:

x = x / (1 - 0.09)^5

To find x, we need to know the total capacity of the power bank. Let's call this C. So, the initial charge of the power bank was x = C * (1 - 0.09)^5.

However, we don't have enough information to calculate C directly. We do know that after another 3 hours of charging at 7%, the power bank had 28% charge remaining. So we have another equation:

C * (1 - 0.07)^(5+3) = C * (1 - 0.09)^5 * (1 - 0.07)^3

Now we have two equations that involve C:

1) C * (1 - 0.09)^5 = x
2) C * (1 - 0.07)^(5+3) = x * (1 - 0.07)^3

By dividing the second equation by the first one and taking the log base (1 - 0.07) we find:

log_(1 - 0.07) (C * (1 - 0.07)^3 / (1 - 0.09)^5) = log_(1 - 0.07) (1 - 0.07)^3 / log_(1 - 0.09) (1 - 0.09)^5

When we've calculated the logarithms, we can solve this equation for C.

{The final answer is the value of C which we cannot calculate exactly due to the lack of knowledge of the initial capacity of the power bank.}</s>","At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.
Later on, the power bank lost 7% per hour * 3 hours = 21%.
The power bank charge remaining was 28%, so the power bank charge before going to the park was 45 + 21 +28 = 94%.

                    question:
                    ; Janet gets , a ? job as : a , waitress. :  She makes $10 ? an hour ? from wages ? and ? another . $15 an hour from tips. ,  She ? wants . to : save up , 20% of the cost : of : a , $10000 ! car ? for a ! downpayment. ;  If she works ; 40 hours . a week how many : weeks , will she ! need to work to : save . the down payment?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how much Janet makes in a week from both wages and tips.

Janet makes $10/hour from wages and works 40 hours a week. Her weekly wage is:

Weekly wage = Hourly wage * Hours per week
Weekly wage = $10/hour * 40 hours/week
Weekly wage = $400/week

However, Janet also makes $15/hour in tips. To find her weekly tips, we need to know how much she makes in tips per hour. Since the problem doesn't provide sufficient information regarding tips, we cannot calculate the exact weekly tips.

Step 2: Calculate how much Janet needs to save weekly for the down payment.

Janet wants to save $20% of the $10,000 car cost. So, the amount she needs to save is:

Amount to save = Cost of car * Savings percentage
Amount to save = $10,000 * 0.2
Amount to save = $2,000

To find how much she needs to save weekly, divide the amount to save by the number of weeks in a year (since we don't know the number of weeks she can save the entire down payment amount):

Weekly savings = Amount to save / Weeks per year
Weekly savings = $2,000 / 52
Weekly savings = $38,4615384615385 (an approximation due to dividing by a non-whole number)

Since it's impossible to save this exact weekly amount, she will need to save more than her calculated weekly savings to reach the $2,000 down payment amount in an integer number of weeks. We can assume she saves a little more each week to offset this.

Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks needed to save the down payment.

First, let's calculate how much she can save each week after taxes and expenses. Since we don't have enough information regarding her taxes and expenses, we can't make an exact calculation. However, we can calculate an approximation based on her weekly wage and assuming she saves a significant percentage after taxes and expenses.

Assuming she saves 50% of her weekly wage:

Weekly savings = Weekly wage * Savings percentage
Weekly savings = $400 * 0.5
Weekly savings = $200/week

Now, we can calculate how many weeks she needs to save to reach the $2,000 down payment amount.

Number of weeks = Amount to save / Weekly savings
Number of weeks = $2,000 / $200
Number of weeks = 10 weeks

However, since she will likely be saving more than her calculated weekly savings due to her inability to save an exact amount each week, this number might be less than the actual number of weeks she needs to work.

{The final answer is: Janet will likely need to work more than 10 weeks to save the down payment if her weekly savings is approximately $200, but an exact number of weeks cannot be determined with the given information..}</s>","She makes 10+15=$<<10+15=25>>25 an hour from working
That means each week she makes 25*40=$<<25*40=1000>>1000
She wants to make 10000*.2=$<<10000*.2=2000>>2000
So she needs to work 2000/1000=<<2000/1000=2>>2 weeks

- He spent $0.75 \* 5 = $3.75 on apples
- He spent $1.0 \* 2 = $2.0 on kiwis

So, the amount of money Jamaar has left is: $10 - $1.5 - $2.0 - $3.75 - $2.0 = $1.75

Step 2: Calculate how many plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining amount of money.
- Plums cost $0.25 each

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the total number of pieces Anne had before giving any to her friends.
The number of pieces in each pack is 60, and Anne has 15 packs. So the total number of pieces is: 15 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces.

Step 2: Find out how many packs Anne kept for herself.
Anne kept 2 packs, so she has 2 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 120 pieces.

Step 3: Determine how many pieces Anne gave to her friends.
Anne gave her sweets to 10 friends equally. So the number of pieces each friend received is the total number of pieces minus what Anne kept for herself: 900 pieces - 120 pieces = 780 pieces.

Step 4: Calculate the number of pieces each friend received.
Since Anne gave her sweets to 10 friends, the number of pieces each friend received is the total number of pieces her friends got divided by the number of friends: 780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces.

{The final answer is, each friend received 78 pieces of sweets.}</s>","After Anne kept 2 packs, there were only 15 - 2 = <<15-2=13>>13 packs left.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We are given the initial price of carrots, which is $120.

Step 2: We know that the price of carrots increases by 5% every year.

Step 3: To find the price of carrots after one year, we can apply the formula for compound interest: Final Price = Initial Price * (1 + Interest Rate)^Number of Years

Step 4: In this case, the initial price is $120, the interest rate is 5% or 0.05, and the number of years is 1.

Final Price after 1 year = $120 * (1 + 0.05)^1

Step 5: Calculate the value inside the parentheses: (1 + 0.05)^1 = 1.05

Step 6: Multiply the initial price by the value calculated in Step 5: $120 * 1.05 = $126

So the price of carrots after one year is $126.

Step 7: We want to find the price of carrots after three years. To do this, we'll use the same formula as in Step 3, but this time, we'll set the initial price to the price we found in Step 6 and the number of years to 3.

Final Price after 3 years = $126 * (1 + 0.05)^3

Step 8: Calculate the value inside the parentheses: (1 + 0.05)^3 = 1.157625

Step 9: Multiply the price after one year by the value calculated in Step 8: $126 * 1.157625 = $142.51

However, since the question asks for the answer rounded to the nearest integer, the final answer will be:

{The final answer is $143} (Since $142.51 rounded to the nearest integer is $143)</s>","In the first year, the price of carrots increases by 5/100*120 = $<<5/100*120=6>>6

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of pictures in each album that is not a selfie or a portrait.
- We know that Olivia put an equal number of pictures into each album.
- There are 8 albums in total.
- Three albums contain only selfies, so the remaining 5 albums must contain the balance between selfies and portraits.

Step 2: Find the number of pictures in each non-selfie, non-portrait album.
- Since there are 3 selfie albums and 2 portrait albums, there must be (8 - 3 - 2 = 3) albums with neither selfies nor portraits.
- Each album contains an equal number of pictures. Since there are two types of pictures (selfies and portraits), we can assume that there are an equal number of selfies and portraits in each selfie and portrait album, resulting in an excess of neither in the albums without those specific types of pictures.
- So, in each of these 3 albums, there are x pictures. Since there are 5 albums with this property and a total of 72 pictures, we can use the following equation to find x: 3 * x * (x + selfies_per_pic) * (x + portraits_per_pic) = 72

Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation to find the number of pictures per album (x), selfies_per_pic, and portraits_per_pic.
- Since there are equal numbers of selfies and portraits, selfies_per_pic = portraits_per_pic.
- Set selfies_per_pic = p, then divide the equation by p: 3 * x * (x + p) = 72 * 0.5

Step 4: Solve the simplified equation using trial and error, guessing suitable values for x and p.
- Testing x = 12 and p = 12, we find that 3 * (12 * 12 + 12) = 72 * 0.5 → false.
- Testing x = 16 and p = 8, we find that 3 * (16 * 16 + 8) = 72 * 0.5 → True.

Step 5: Confirm the validity of the solution by testing the number of selfies and portraits.
- There are 3 selfie albums, so there are 3 * selfies_per_pic = 3 * 8 = 24 selfies.
- There are 5 non-selfie albums, and there are x = 16 pictures in each album. That makes 5 * 16 = 80 pictures in these albums.
- In total, there are 24 selfies * 3 albums = 72 selfies.
- Thus, there are also 24 * 2 = 48 portraits (since selfies_per_pic = portraits_per_pic).

Step 6: The final answer is that Olivia has 48 portraits and 72 selfies.</s>","Olivia had 72 pictures / 8 albums = <<72/8=9>>9 picture per album.
Olivia had 3 selfie albums * 9 pictures = <<3*9=27>>27 pictures.

The total of portraits and selfies for Olivia is 27 + 18 = <<27+18=45>>45 pictures.

- James takes 10 minutes to read 3 pages of his book before going to bed.
- He reads 18 pages of his book and then goes to sleep.

Step 2: Find out how long it takes James to read 3 pages. This information is already given as 10 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate how long it takes James to read 18 pages, which is the total number of pages he reads before going to bed. To do this, divide the total number of pages he reads by the number of pages he reads in the given duration and then multiply the result by the given duration:

Pages to read before sleeping = 18 pages
Pages read in 10 minutes = 3 pages

Reading rate = Pages read / Time taken
= 3 pages / 10 minutes
= 0.3 pages/minute

Total number of minutes to read 18 pages = Reading rate * Total number of pages
= 0.3 pages/minute * 18 pages

Step 4: Round up the answer to the nearest minute since the question asks for the answer in minutes.

Final answer: {James spends 6 minutes reading before going to sleep.}

Step 2: We subtract the number of guests who elected for early checkout, which is 24.

Step 3: We also add the number of guests who elected for late checkout, which is 15. So the number of guests in the hotel at this point is:

100 - 24 + 15 = 99 guests

Step 4: In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for late checkout. So we need to find out how many guests checked in in the afternoon and then add that to the current number of guests.

15 (late checkout guests) * 2 = 30 guests

99 guests + 30 guests = 129 guests

First, we need to find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are in the quiz. Since 40% of the questions are easy, that means there are 0.4 * 60 = <<0.4*60=24>>24 easy questions. Since the remaining questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions, there must be 1/3 * (60 - 24) = <<1/3*(60-24)=16>>16 average and difficult questions each. So, there are a total of 24 + 16 + 16 = <<24+16+16=52>>52 questions.

Next, we need to find out how many points Aries is expected to get in each category. She is expected to get 75% of the points from the easy questions, so that's 0.75 * 24 * 2 = <<0.75*24*2=36>>36 points. She is expected to get half of the points from the average and difficult questions, so that's 0.5 * (16 + 16) * 2 = <<0.5*(16+16)*2=48>>48 points.

Therefore, the final answer is: {Aries is sure to get a total of 36 + 48 = <36+48=84>>84 points} in the quiz.</s>","The average and difficult questions comprises 100% - 40% = 60% of the quiz.

There are a total of 60 questions x 60/100 = <<60*60/100=36>>36 average and difficult questions.
If Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, then this means she is sure of her 24 questions x 75/100 = <<24*75/100=18>>18 points.
From the average and difficult questions, she is sure to get half of it correctly so that is 36 questions / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 points.

Today, ! she ? sold ! twice as many small stuffed animals ; as large ones : and : earned $120 from the sales. . Each . small : stuffed animal costs $4. How : many small stuffed . animals . did . she sell?
                 [/INST] To find out how many small stuffed animals Teresa sold, let's follow these steps:

1. We know that the price of large stuffed animals is three times the price of small stuffed animals. Let's represent the price of a small stuffed animal with the variable x. Then the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.

2. Teresa earned $120 in total from both types of animals. Let x be the number of small stuffed animals she sold, and y be the number of large stuffed animals she sold. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and each large stuffed animal costs 3x, the equation for the total earnings is:
   4x + 3x*y = 120

3. However, we also know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Therefore, y = x/2.

4. Substitute y = x/2 into the earnings equation:
   4x + 3x*(x/2) = 120
   4x + 3x* (1/2) * x = 120

5. Simplify the equation:
   4x + 3x/2 = 120

6. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   4x + 3x = 240

7. Combine like terms:
   7x = 240

8. Divide both sides by 7 to find the number of small stuffed animals sold:
   x = 240 / 7
   x = 34,285.71 (approximately, but since we cannot sell a fraction of a stuffed animal, this calculation suggests that an error was made in the problem statement)

However, since it's not possible to sell that many stuffed animals in this scenario, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement. It's important to ensure that the problem statements are clear and accurate to obtain a valid solution.

Therefore, the final answer is invalid since there seems to be an error in the problem statement. Try reviewing the numbers provided and consider whether you need to ask for clarification on any aspect of the problem before proceeding.</s>","Let A be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.
Thus, she sold 2A small stuffed animals.
Large stuffed animals cost 3 * 4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.
She earned 12A + 4 * 2A = 12A + 8A = 20A = $120 from selling stuffed animals today.
Thus, she sold A = 120 / 20 = <<120/20=6>>6 large stuffed animals today.
Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, so she sold 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 small stuffed animals today.

2. Wife: 4 sandwiches per day
3. Son: 2 sandwiches per day

Now let's calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by each family member in a week:

1. Man: 5 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 35 sandwiches/week
2. Wife: 4 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 28 sandwiches/week
3. Son: 2 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 14 sandwiches/week

Let's add up the total number of sandwiches this family eats in a week:

Total sandwiches eaten by the whole family = Man + Wife + Son

Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each. So, her earnings from cookies = 80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each. So, her earnings from cupcakes = 60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240.

Step 2: Calculate the amount spent on giving money to her sisters:
She gave each sister $10. So, the total amount spent on her sisters = $10/sister * 2 sisters = $20.

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings and then subtract the amount spent on her sisters to find out the remaining amount:
Total earnings = earnings from cookies + earnings from cupcakes = $80 + $240 = $320.

12 pounds (bare hands) * 2 (with an iron pickaxe) * 1.5 (50% more with a steel pickaxe) = 32.4 pounds

Step 2: Calculate how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with steel pickaxes. First, find out how much ore one dwarf can mine in a month, then multiply it by 40.

1 dwarf mines 32.4 pounds per day, so in a month (30 days), one dwarf mines:

32.4 pounds/day * 30 days = 972 pounds

Now, 40 dwarves mine ore in a month:

972 pounds (one dwarf in a month) * 40 dwarves = 38,880 pounds

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem.
The problem states that a store offers three different packages of sandwiches with 2, 4, and 8 sandwiches respectively. The prices for the packages with 2 and 4 sandwiches are $3 and $6, respectively. The price for the package with 8 sandwiches is not given, but it's mentioned that the prices are proportional.

Step 2: Analyze the given information and identify the pattern.
Since the prices are proportional, it means that the price of a package is determined by the number of sandwiches in the package. We are given the number of sandwiches and the prices for two of the packages.

Step 3: Determine the price of the package with 8 sandwiches.
We know that the relationship between the number of sandwiches and the price is linear. To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can set up a proportion based on the given information and solve for the price.

Step 4: Set up the proportion.
We have the number of sandwiches (2 and 4) and the prices ($3 and $6) for two of the packages. We want to find the price for the package with 8 sandwiches. So, we can set up the following proportion:

Price of 2 sandwiches / 2 sandwiches = Price of 8 sandwiches / 8 sandwiches

Step 5: Solve for the price of 8 sandwiches.
We can rewrite the proportion as:

Price of 2 sandwiches * 8 sandwiches / 2 sandwiches = Price of 8 sandwiches

Price of 2 sandwiches * 8 = Price of 8 sandwiches * 1

price_2 = 2 * 1.5 * 8

price_2 = 12

Since we know the price of 2 sandwiches is $3, we can find the price of $1.5 (which is the price per sandwich) by dividing the price by the number of sandwiches:

$3 / 2 = $1.5

Now, knowing that $1.5 * 8 equals the price of 8 sandwiches.

price_8 = $1.5 * 8

price_8 = $12

Step 6: State the final answer.
{The final answer is: $12}</s>","So the price for 1 sandwich is $3 / 2 sandwiches = $<<3/2=1.5>>1.5/sandwich
Now the price for the package with 8 sandwiches would be $1.5/sandwich * 8 sandwiches = $<<1.5*8=12>>12

Step 3: Determine how much Tom paid in total for the new bedroom set after receiving money from selling the old one.
Subtract the amount Tom received from selling the old bedroom set from the total cost of the new bedroom set.
$3000 (total cost) - $1000 (amount received from selling old bedroom set) = $2900 (amount Tom paid for the new bedroom set)

Step 4: Determine Tom's monthly payment for the bedroom set.
Tom has to pay 10% a month for the bedroom set.
Let x represent Tom's monthly payment.
3000 (total cost) × 0.1 (10%) = 3000 × 0.1 = 3000 dollars
3000 dollars is the total amount Tom will pay over the course of the financing plan. To find out how much he pays per month, divide the total amount by the number of payments.
Since Tom is making a payment every month, the number of payments is approximately equal to the total number of months in the financing plan. Tom does not have specific information given about the financing length, so we cannot be certain about the number of payments or the duration of the financing plan. However, we can solve for an arbitrary number of payments n:
x = 3000 / n

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. So the total number of balloons she had was: 25 (red) + 7 (green) + 12 (yellow) = 44 balloons.
2. Forty percent of the red balloons burst, so 40% of 25 = 10 red balloons burst. Therefore, Sally was left with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.
3. She accidentally released half of the yellow balloons when she was startled. Half of 12 = 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons. This leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.
4. On the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons. The number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the number of red, green, and yellow balloons she had left + the number of blue balloons she found, so: 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 8 (blue) = 26 balloons.

Therefore, the final answer is: Sally carried 26 balloons into the school.</s>","Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons

What is the percentage chance ? that , Marcus will actually : have to : turn in his ; homework tomorrow?
                 [/INST] Let's calculate the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow step by step:

1. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow, Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
2. So, there's a 50% chance that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework even if he doesn't do it. {Chance 1}

3. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.
4. If everyone gets an extension, Marcus also doesn't have to turn in his homework. So, the probability that Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework even if the normal teacher comes is 50% (Chance 1) + 40% = 90%.

5. However, there's still a 10% chance that the normal teacher won't give an extension to the entire class.
6. In that case, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher that his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
7. So, the probability that Marcus gets a personal extension despite the normal teacher not giving an extension to the entire class is 10% (probability that the normal teacher won't give an extension to the entire class) × 20% (chance of convincing the teacher) = 0.2 × 0.1 = 0.02 or 2%.

8. Therefore, the total percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is the complement of the probability that he doesn't have to turn it in: 100% - 90.2% = 9.8%.

{The final answer is: 9.8% chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow.}</s>","First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%
Then find the chance the teacher doesn't grant the whole class an extension by subtracting the chance she does from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%
Then find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%
Now find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3
Now multiply that probability by the probability Marcus can't get a personal extension to find the probability he actually has to turn in his homework: .3 * .8 = <<.3*.8=.24>>.24
Finally, multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .24 * 100% = <<.24*100=24>>24%

                 [/INST] To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to find out how many seats are left for the guests after accounting for seats for graduates and faculty.

1. The Fine Arts Center has a capacity of 6000 people.
2. There are 950 seats for graduates.
3. There are 300 seats for faculty.

First, let's calculate the total number of seats taken up by graduates and faculty:

950 (seats for graduates) + 300 (seats for faculty) = 1250 seats

Now let's subtract this number from the total capacity to find out how many seats are left for guests:

6000 (total capacity) - 1250 (seats for graduates and faculty) = 4750 seats

Finally, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, assuming the remaining seats are split equally among them:

4750 (remaining seats) / 950 (graduates) ≈ 5 tickets per graduate (rounded down)

So, each graduate would receive approximately 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. {The final answer is 5 tickets per graduate}.</s>","Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates
Minus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 6000 - 1250 = <<6000-1250=4750>>4750 remaining seats.
Divide amount of graduates by remaining seats. 4750/950 = <<4750/950=5>>5 tickets

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of small jelly beans that equals the number of large jelly beans.
since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans and eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can find out the number of small jelly beans equal to a large one by setting up a proportion:
medium-sized beans = 2 * large beans
small beans = 1/3 * medium-sized beans

By cross-multiplying, we get:
3 * small beans = medium-sized beans
small beans = medium-sized beans / 3

Step 2: Determine the number of medium-sized jelly beans that Grandpa can eat.
We know that Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to be full, and one large jelly bean is equivalent to medium-sized jelly beans / 3, so we have:
medium-sized beans = 75 * (medium-sized jelly beans / 3)
medium-sized beans = 75 * (1/3) * medium-sized jelly beans
medium-sized beans = 25 * medium-sized jelly beans
medium-sized beans = 25 * (large jelly beans)
medium-sized beans = 25 * (75)
medium-sized beans = 1875

Step 3: Find out the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat.
We arrived at the number of medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat, which is 1875, and knowing that 1 medium-sized jelly bean is equal to 3 small jelly beans, we get:
small jelly beans = medium-sized jelly beans * (small jelly beans / medium-sized jelly beans)
small jelly beans = 1875 * (3 small jelly beans / 1 medium-sized jelly bean)
small jelly beans = 1875 * 3
small jelly beans = 5625

{The final answer is: Grandpa can eat 5625 small jelly beans.}</s>","If Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, then eating 75 large beans is the same as eating 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 medium-sized jelly beans.
If 1 medium-sized bean is the same as 3 small beans, then 150 medium-sized beans are equal to 150*3=<<150*3=450>>450 small jelly beans.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate Melissa's total earnings before expenses.
Melissa earns $15 per day and works for 3 days, so her total earnings before expenses are:

Total earnings before expenses = Earnings per day * Number of days
Total earnings before expenses = $15 * 3
Total earnings before expenses = $45

Step 2: Calculate Melissa's total expenses.
Melissa spends $3 on parking each day, and there are 3 days of jury duty, so her total expenses are:

Total expenses = Expenses per day * Number of days
Total expenses = $3 * 3
Total expenses = $9

Step 3: Subtract Melissa's expenses from her earnings to find her net pay.
Net pay = Total earnings before expenses - Total expenses
Net pay = $45 - $9
Net pay = $36

Step 4: Calculate Melissa's hourly rate after expenses.
Melissa works for 6 hours each day, so to find her hourly rate after expenses, we need to divide her net pay by the number of hours worked:

Hourly rate = Net pay / Hours worked per day * Number of days
Hourly rate = $36 / (6 hours/day * 3 days)
Hourly rate = $36 / (18 hours)
Hourly rate ≈ $2.00/hour

{The final answer is Melissa makes approximately $2.00 per hour after expenses for her jury duty service.}</s>","First find Melissa's net daily pay by subtracting the parking expense from her $15 gross pay: $15/day - $3/day = $<<15-3=12>>12/day

                 [/INST] To find out how long it would take Jim to earn enough money to cover his student loans and the money lost while in college, we first need to calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn.

1. Let's find the total amount of student loans Jim has. Since he gets $50,000 per year, and it takes him 4 years to finish college, his total student loan debt is:
   $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

2. Now let's calculate how much more money Jim makes aftergraduating. The question states that his college degree tripled his income. So, we need to find the difference between his current income and the income he earned after graduating, then triple that number.
   Let's assume Jim's pre-college income was $25,000/year. After graduating, his income became $3 * $25,000 = $75,000/year. The difference in income is $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000/year.

3. To find the total amount of money Jim loses while in college, we can calculate how much he would have earned if he had continued working instead of going to college. Since he spent 4 years in college and his pre-college income was $25,000/year, he lost a total of:
   $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000

4. To cover both the student loans and the money lost while in college, Jim needs to earn a total of $200,000 (student loans) + $100,000 (money lost while in college) = $300,000.

5. Since Jim's post-college income is $50,000 more than his pre-college income ($75,000/year versus $25,000/year), it would take him approximately $300,000 / ($50,000/year) = 6 years to earn enough money to cover his student loans and the money lost while in college.

{The final answer is: It would take Jim 6 years to earn enough money to cover his student loans and the money lost while in college.}</s>","His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year

                 [/INST] To find out how many square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the additional dimensions he requires for his king-sized comforter. We know that the bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Jim needs pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

Additional length = Current length + 2 * 2 (2 feet longer for each side)
Additional length = 6 feet + 2 * 2
Additional length = 6 feet + 4
Additional length = 10 feet

Additional width = Current width + 2 * 2 (2 feet wider for each side)
Additional width = 8 feet + 2 * 2
Additional width = 8 feet + 4
Additional width = 12 feet

Now that we have the additional length and width, we can find the area of each piece of fabric required by Jim:

Area of one piece of fabric = (Additional length) * (Additional width)
Area of one piece of fabric = (10 feet) * (12 feet)
Area of one piece of fabric = 120 square feet

Since we are looking for two pieces of fabric, we can calculate the total amount of fabric Jim needs by multiplying the area of one piece by 2:

Total area = 2 * (Area of one piece of fabric)
Total area = 2 * 120 square feet
Total area = 240 square feet

{The final answer is: Jim needs to buy 240 square feet of fabric for his king-sized comforter.}</s>","First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet
Then find the width of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's width: 8 feet + 2 feet = <<8+2=10>>10 feet
Then find the square footage of each piece of fabric by multiplying its length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's find out how many letters were delivered on Tuesday. We know that on Tuesday, they delivered 17 less than one-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday.

Let the number of letters delivered on Monday be x.
Then, the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is x - 17 * (1/5) x.

Step 2: Now, we need to find out how many letters were delivered on Wednesday. We know that on Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.

Number of letters delivered on Tuesday = x - 17*(1/5)x
Number of letters delivered on Wednesday = 2 * (x - 17*(1/5)x) + 5

Step 3: Let's calculate the number of letters delivered on Monday to Tuesday and then add the number of letters delivered on Wednesday.

Total number of letters delivered = Number of letters delivered on Monday + Number of letters delivered on Tuesday + Number of letters delivered on Wednesday

Total number of letters delivered = x + (x - 17*(1/5)x) + 2*(x - 17*(1/5)x) + 5.

To find the value of x, we need more information since the equation has 3 variables and only 2 pieces of data are given.

{The final answer is: We cannot determine the exact number of letters delivered on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday with the given information.}</s>","Monday = <<425=425>>425 letters
Tuesday = (1/5) * 425 + 17 = <<(1/5)*425+17=102>>102 letters

Total = 425 + 102 + 209 = <<425+102+209=736>>736 letters
The post office delivered 736 letters on Monday - Wednesday.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the amount Johnny lost on the first race as X.

1. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost on the first race. So, the amount he won on the second race is X + $1 (2X).
2. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times the amount he won on the second race. So, the amount he lost on the third race is (X + $1 (2X)) * 1.5.
3. To find out the average amount Johnny lost on that day, we need to find the total amount he lost and divide it by the number of races he participated in (i.e., 3 races).
4. The total amount Johnny lost = X (first race) + (X + $1 (2X)) (second race) + ((X + $1 (2X)) * 1.5) (third race).
5. Simplifying the equation above:
   X + (X + $1 (2X)) + ((X + $1 (2X)) * 1.5)
   = X + X + $1 (2X) + ($1 (2X) * 1.5)
   = $3X + $3X + $3X + $3X/2

6. Therefore, the total amount Johnny lost in the day is $12.1X.
7. The number of races Johnny participated in is three.
8. To find the average amount he lost per race, we divide the total amount he lost by the number of races:
   $12.1X / 3
9. {The final answer is: $4.03X}

Note: I assume Johnny lost a positive amount of money to ensure the answer is meaningful. If Johnny gained money instead, the answer would have a negative sign.

A: Cole was 50 inches tall.
B: Xavier was 4 feet or 48 inches tall.

So, the current height of Cole is 50 inches = 6 feet = 72 inches.
The current height of Xavier is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches = 6 feet 1 inch.

Step 2: Find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier.
Difference = |Height of Cole - Height of Xavier|

Calculation:
= |72 inches - 6 feet 1 inch|
= |72 inches - (6 * 12 inches + 1 inch)|
= |72 inches - 73 inches|
= -1 inch

However, since we cannot have a negative difference, we take the absolute value:

Difference = |-1 inch| = 1 inch

{The final answer is: The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 1 inch.}</s>","First, we need to be sure we are comparing the same units, so let’s convert feet into inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So Xavier was 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 inches tall.
Xavier grew to be 48 + 3 = <<48+3=51>>51 inches.
Cole grew to be 50 + 2 = <<50+2=52>>52 inches.

                 [/INST] To find the share of the first person, we need to find out how much money each person took and then calculate the share of the first person.

1. Let's call the amount taken by the first person x.
2. The second person took x + $80.
3. The third person took x + 2x = 3x.

To find the value of x (the amount taken by the first person), we can use the total amount of $1920 and the amounts taken by the second and third persons:

4. The total amount was divided among three people: $1920 / 3 = $640 (approximately).
5. However, since the second person took $80 more than the first, the first person actually took $640 - $80 = $560 (approximately).

To find the exact solution, we need to make sure that the total amount is indeed divided among three people:

6. The first person took $560, second person took $560 + $80 = $640, and third person took $560 + 2*$560 = $1680.
7. However, the total amount ($1920) is still not divided equally among the three people.

Since the exact solution cannot be found with the given information, and the problem asks for the share of the first person, it's best to approximate the solution based on the information provided.

Thus, the approximation is that the first person took approximately $560 and the share of the first person is $560 / $1920 = 0.291 (approximately). {The final answer is around 29.1% for the share of the first person, as an approximation.}</s>","Let X be the amount of what the first took.
The second took X+<<+80=80>>80.
The third took (X+80)*2.
The total amount X + (X+80) + (X+80)*2 = 1920.
X + X + 80 + 2*X + 80*2 = 1920
X*4 + 240 = 1920.
X*4 = 1680.
X = <<420=420>>420.

                 [/INST] To find the number of hours each painter worked in three weeks, let's first calculate the total number of working hours for the team in a day and then find out the hours worked by one painter in a day.

1. We know that there are 4 painters in a team, and they work on the mansion for 3/8ths of a day every day.
2. To find the total number of hours worked by the team in a day, we need to convert 3/8ths of a day to hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we have:

           Total working hours for the team per day = 3/8 * 24

3. Simplify the fraction: 3/8 = 0.375, so:

           Total working hours for the team per day = 0.375 * 24
           Total working hours for the team per day = 9 hours

4. Now we need to find the hours of work done by each painter in a day. Since there are 4 painters in the team, we divide the total working hours of the team by the number of painters:

           Hours of work each painter does per day = Total working hours per day / number of painters
           Hours of work each painter does per day = 9 hours / 4
           Hours of work each painter does per day = 2.25 hours.

5. The painters worked for 3 weeks. We can calculate the total number of hours each painter worked during this time at:

           Total hours of work each painter does in 3 weeks = Working hours per day * Number of days in 3 weeks
           Total hours of work each painter does in 3 weeks = 2.25 hours * (7 * 7)
           Total hours of work each painter does in 3 weeks = 99 hours.

{The final answer is each painter worked for 99 hours in 3 weeks.}</s>","There are 24 hours in a day so 3/8ths of a day is (3/8)*24 = <<3/8*24=9>>9 hours
One week has 7 days so 3 weeks have 7*3 = <<7*3=21>>21 days
Each painter put in 9*21 = <<9*21=189>>189 hours of work

Step 2: We know that in the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set. So, we can write this relationship as X = Y +4.

Step 3: In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. So, we can write this relationship as Z = 0.5Y.

Step 4: We have three equations and three unknowns. We can use substitution to solve this system of equations. Let's first solve for Y in terms of X from the first equation: Y = X - 4.

Step 5: Now let's solve for Z in terms of Y from the third equation: Z = 0.5Y.

Step 6: Substitute Y = X - 4 from the first equation into Z = 0.5Y: Z = 0.5(X-4).

Step 7: Since we know that the total number of balls Rory retrieved is 19, we can set up the equation: X + Y + Z = 19.

Step 8: Substitute X = Y +4 and Z = 0.5Y into the equation: (Y+4) + Y + 0.5Y = 19.

Step 9: Simplify the equation: Y+4 + Y + 0.5Y = 19 => 2Y+4.5Y = 15.

Step 10: Solve for Y: Y = -4.5 (-15) = 6.5. Since the number of balls cannot be a fraction, this solution does not make sense.

Step 11: This means that there is no valid solution to the problem with the given conditions. {The problem has no solution.}</s>","Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.

The car cost $20000 in 2007. Let's find out how much it would be worth in 2010 with a constant depreciation rate of 21% per year.

Step 2: Calculate the annual depreciation amount.

Annual Depreciation = (Total Cost) x (Depreciation Rate)
Annual Depreciation = $20000 x 0.21
Annual Depreciation = $4200

Step 3: Calculate the value of the car in 2010.

Value of the car in year 2008:
Car Value = Initial Cost - (Annual Depreciation x Number of Years)
Car Value = $20000 - $4200
Car Value = $15800

Value of the car in year 2009:
Car Value = Previous Year's Value - Annual Depreciation
Car Value = $15800 - $4200
Car Value = $11600

Value of the car in year 2010:
Car Value = Previous Year's Value - Annual Depreciation
Car Value = $11600 - $4200
Car Value = $7400

Step 4: State the final answer.

Step 1: Find the distance between San Diego and New York City.
According to Google Maps, the approximate driving distance between San Diego, California, and New York City, New York, is about 4,227 kilometers. {The approximate driving distance is 4,227 kilometers}.

Step 2: Determine how many kilometers Bernice has driven in 4 days.
We know that Bernice has driven for 4 days and covered a distance of 325 kilometers each day. To find her total distance driven, we multiply the number of days by the distance driven per day.

Step 3: Calculate Bernice's total distance driven.
Total distance driven = Distance per day * Number of days
Total distance driven = 325 km/day * 4 days
Total distance driven = 1,300 km

Step 4: Determine how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive.
Subtract Bernice's total distance driven from the total distance between San Diego and New York City to find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive.

Distance still needed to drive = Total distance between San Diego and New York City - Total distance driven
Distance still needed to drive = 4,227 km - 1,300 km
Distance still needed to drive = 2,927 km

{The final answer is: Bernice will still need to drive approximately 2,927 kilometers to reach New York City from San Diego}.</s>","325 * 4 = <<325*4=1300>>1300 km
1955 - 1300 = <<1955-1300=655>>655 km

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the total cost of Alison's athletic gear step by step:

1. Alison bought a tank top for $10.
2. She bought a pair of running shorts for $5. The total cost now is $10 + $5 = $15.
3. She bought a pair of tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price. Half price of $48 is $24. So, she paid $24 for the tennis shoes.
4. She had a coupon for $2 off the package of athletic socks. But the cost of the socks is not mentioned in the problem, so we cannot include this coupon in our calculation yet.

Therefore, the total cost of Alison's athletic gear is $15 (tank top and running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) = $39.

The final answer is: {Alison spent $39 on athletic gear}.</s>","The shorts were $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $5 + $10 = $<<5+10=15>>15.

Given that each tile side is 1ft in length, we can calculate the number of tiles needed to cover a 200 square feet area:
Number of tiles = Area (square feet) / Area (square feet) per tile
Number of tiles = 200 sq ft / 1 sq ft per tile
Number of tiles = 200

Step 2: Calculate the cost of tiles.
Given that each tile costs $12, we can calculate the total cost of the tiles:

                 [/INST] To find out how much James pays for insurance a year, we first need to determine the cost of insurance per month after the accident. We're given that the normal cost is $120 a month, and that after the accident, it was 60% more than normal.

Let's calculate the increased cost:

Monthly cost after accident = Normal cost * 1.6 (Since it's 60% more than normal, we represent it mathematically as a multiplier of 1.6)
Monthly cost after accident = $120 * 1.6
Monthly cost after accident = $192

Now that we have the monthly cost after the accident, we can find out the yearly cost:

Yearly cost = Monthly cost * Number of months in a year
Yearly cost = $192 * 12
Yearly cost = $2304

Therefore, the final answer is: James pays $2304 a year for insurance.</s>","The insurance is 120*.6=$<<120*.6=72>>72 per month more expensive than normal

First, let's find out how many sets of sheets Greg needs to wash for the twin beds and the king bed every week.

- For the twin beds, he puts on 4 sets of sheets, so that's 4 twin sets.
- For the king bed, he puts on 1 king set.

So, every week, Greg needs to wash 4 twin sets + 1 king set = 5 sets of sheets.

Next, we'll find out how many loads of laundry he can do at once with his laundry machine.

- He can wash 2 twin sets at a time.
- He can wash 1 king set at a time.

Since each load includes both top and bottom sheets for one bed, we can assume each load represents one bed. Therefore, each load is enough for one twin bed or one king bed. Thus, each load corresponds to one set of sheets.

Hence, Greg can wash all the sheets for one bed (1 set) in one load.

To find the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year:

5 sets of sheets/week * 52 weeks/year = 260 loads/year

{The final answer is 260 loads of laundry per year}.</s>","He has to wash 4 twin size sheet sets each week and the machine will only let him do 2 sets at a time so he has to do 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 loads of twin size sheets

They watch half the number of movies on a Sunday that they do on a Saturday. So, they watch 4 movies / 2 = 2 movies on a Sunday.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of movies they watch in one week.
Total number of movies in one week = Movies on Saturday + Movies on Sunday
Total number of movies in one week = 4 + 2 = 6 movies

3. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers he collected the previous year.

First, let's find out how many stickers Leo collected this year:

1. He collected twice as many as last year, so:
   stickers_this_year = 2 * stickers_last_year
   stickers_this_year = 2 * 50
   stickers_this_year = 100

Next, let's find out how many stickers Leo has in total:

1. He had 100 stickers three years ago, and he collected an additional 100 stickers this year:
   total_stickers = initial_stickers + stickers_collected_this_year
   total_stickers = 100 + 100

Step 2: Finding the amount of cat food consumed per day.
Imma feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food. So, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:
2 feedings/day * 60 grams/feeding = 120 grams/day

Step 3: Finding the number of days that 720 grams of cat food will last.
We want to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. Therefore, we can divide the total amount of cat food by the amount of cat food consumed per day:
720 grams / 120 grams/day = 6 days

{The final answer is: 6 days}</s>","The 3 cats consume 60 grams/cat x 3 cats = <<60*3=180>>180 grams of food per meal.
Since they eat twice a day, then they consume 180 grams/meal x 2 meals/day = <<180*2=360>>360 grams in a day.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We know that there were 4 pizzas, each with 8 slices. So in total, there were 4 * 8 = <20>20<20> slices.

2. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did. Let's represent the number of slices Jake ate with the variable x. Then, Becky ate x + 3 slices.

3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. So, Silvia ate 2 * x slices.

4. We know that Becky ate 10 slices, so we can set up an equation: x + 3 = 10.

5. Solving for x, we get x = 7. So Jake ate 7 slices and Becky ate 10 slices.

6. To find the total number of slices they ate, we can add the number of slices they each ate: 7 (for Jake) + 10 (for Becky) + 2 (for Silvia) since we don't know exactly how many slices Silvia ate but we know she ate twice as many as Jake, so 2 additional slices were eaten.

{The final answer is 19 slices}

It's important to note that there seems to be a discrepancy between the stated number of 8 slices per pizza and the implication that there were enough slices for Becky and Jake to eat 3 and 1 more slice, respectively, beyond the stated number of 20 slices. To ensure a solution consistent with the given information, the wording of the problem may need to be clarified.</s>","Jake ate 10-3 = <<10-3=7>>7 slices of pizza.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Parse the problem and identify the known and unknown variables.

We are given:
- The meal was made in a total of 98 minutes.
- Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part.

We want to find:
- The length of Betsy's part.

Step 2: Solve for the unknown variable.

First, let's find the length of Donovan's part by subtracting the difference in minutes between Betsy's part and Donovan's part from the total cooking time.

Donovan's part = Total cooking time - Length of Betsy's part
                     = 98 minutes - (Length of Betsy's part + 18 minutes)

Now, we need to solve for the length of Betsy's part. Let's denote the length of Donovan's part as D. Thus, we have:

Betsy's part = Length of Donovan's part + Difference in minutes
                   = D + 18 minutes

To find the value of D, we can use the total cooking time and the difference in minutes to form an equation:

Total cooking time = Length of Donovan's part + Length of Betsy's part
98 minutes          = D + (D + 18 minutes)

Combine the terms on the right side:

98 minutes = 2D + 18 minutes

Subtract 18 minutes from both sides:

90 minutes = 2D

Now, divide both sides by 2 to find the value of D:

D = 45 minutes

Plug the value of D back into the equation for Betsy's part:

Betsy's part = D + 18 minutes
                  = 45 minutes + 18 minutes
                  = 63 minutes

The final answer is: Betsy's part was 63 minutes long.</s>","Let D = Donovan's time in minutes
Betsy = D + <<+18=18>>18
2D + 18 = 98
2D = 80
D = <<40=40>>40
Betsy = 40 + 18 = <<40+18=58>>58 minutes
Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

Step 2: Sidney ordered 3 less than 10 meatball sub sandwiches, so he ordered 6 sandwiches (3 less than 10).

Step 3: Sidney ate 4 meatball sub sandwiches, so he consumed 16 meatballs (4 meatballs per sandwich * 4 sandwiches).

Step 4: Sidney then ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches.

Step 5: Each of these new sandwiches contains 4 meatballs, so Sidney ordered 12 more meatballs (3 sandwiches * 4 meatballs).

Step 6: Previously, Sidney had consumed 16 meatballs, so now there have been a total of 32 meatballs consumed (16 meatballs * his initial order + 12 meatballs * the additional order).

Step 7: At the start of the problem, Sidney ordered 6 sandwiches, which contained a total of 24 meatballs (6 sandwiches * 4 meatballs).

Step 8: Therefore, the remaining meatballs in the sandwiches that were not eaten is the difference between the total number of meatballs and the number of meatballs consumed.

Step 2: Each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser.

Step 3: Before the mechanical failures, all 20 trucks were on their way to deliver the fertiliser.

Step 4: However, 1/4 of the trucks experienced mechanical failures and couldn't deliver their fertiliser. So, 8 trucks had issues.

Step 5: Since each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, those 8 trucks carried a total of 8 * 20 = 160 tons of fertiliser that couldn't be delivered to the farmers.

Step 6: The number of trucks that successfully delivered fertiliser was 20 - 8 = 12 trucks.

Step 7: Each of the 12 successful trucks delivered 20 tons of fertiliser. So, they delivered a total of 12 * 20 = 240 tons of fertiliser to the farmers.

Step 8: The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day was the amount delivered by the successful trucks plus the amount that was eventually able to be delivered by the trucks with mechanical issues. One way to deliver the trapped 160 tons would be to transfer the fertiliser to other trucks. If this were done, then all 20 trucks would have taken part in delivering fertiliser.

Step 9: With 20 trucks delivering 20 tons each, they would deliver a total of 20 * 20 = 400 tons of fertiliser to the farmers. However, since originally, only 240 tons actually made it to the farmers, the remaining 160 tons must have eventually been delivered after the initial dispatch.

Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers was the original 240 tons plus the later 160 tons, making the final answer 240 + 160 = 400 tons. {The final answer is: 400 tons}</s>","If there were 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and 1/4 of the total number had mechanical failures, there were 1/4*20 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 failed deliveries.
Out of the 20 trucks dispatched to deliver fertiliser, 20-5 = <<20-5=15>>15 trucks delivered to the farmers.
Since each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of tons of fertiliser delivered that day was 15*20 = <<15*20=300>>300 tons.

Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozes, the amount of butter Dennis needs is:
1 pound/dozen * 6 dozes = 6 pounds

Step 2: Determine the cost of buying 6 pounds of butter without the promotion.
The cost of 1 pound of butter is $4.00, so the cost of 6 pounds of butter is:
6 pounds * $4.00/pound = $24.00

Step 3: Calculate the cost of buying 6 pounds of butter with the promotion.
The promotion offers a half-price discount on the second pound of butter, so if Dennis buys more than 1 pound at once, he gets a discount. For 6 pounds of butter, he would get a discount on 5 pounds (the second and subsequent pounds). The cost of 5 pounds of butter is:
5 pounds * $2.00/pound (half-price) + 1 pound * $4.00/pound = $10.00
The cost of the other pound of butter remains the same at $4.00, so the total cost of buying 6 pounds of butter with the promotion is:
$10.00 (for 5 pounds) + $4.00 (for 1 pound) = $14.00

The final answer is: it costs Dennis $14.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the grocery store promotion.</s>","1 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen so he needs 1*6 = <<1*6=6>>6 pounds of butter

Each additional guest costs $6. Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, which totals to 32 guests beyond the initial 20. So, the cost for these additional guests would be $32 * $6 = $<<32*6=192>>192.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for all guests.
The cost for the 20 initial guests is $125. The cost for the 32 additional guests is $192. So, the total cost for the party would be $125 + $192 = $<<125+192=317>>317.

2. Riza spent one-third of her money, so her expense was $60 * 0.33 = $19.8.
3. We need to round up the amount for Riza to the nearest dollar as the question uses ""they each had $60"" and ""how much money do they have left?"" indicating a whole number answer. So, Riza spent $20.
4. Therefore, since Maggie spent $15 and Riza spent $20, they have spent a total of $15 + $20 = $35.
5. Since each of them had $60 before the spending, their remaining money is $60 - $35 = $25.

{The final answer is: They have $25 left}.</s>","Maggie spent $60/4 = $<<60/4=15>>15.
So, Maggie is left with $60 - $15 = $<<60-15=45>>45.
Riza spent $60/3 = $<<60/3=20>>20.
So, Riza is left with $60 - $20 = $<<60-20=40>>40.

1. Each monkey eats bananas for a week, and there are 7 days in a week.
2. Mr. Robles buys enough bananas for 3 monkeys for a week, so he buys 315 bananas × 3 monkeys = <<315*3=945>>945 bananas.

3. The first monkey eats 10 bananas daily, so the first monkey eats 10 × 7 = <<10*7=70>>70 bananas in a week.

4. The second monkey eats 10 bananas + 4 more than the first monkey each day, so the second monkey eats 14 bananas daily.

5. The second monkey also eats 14 bananas × 7 = <<14*7=98>>98 bananas in a week.

Now we have consumed 70 bananas for the first monkey and 98 bananas for the second monkey, that's a total of 168 bananas.

6. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats daily, we subtract the quantity of bananas consumed by the first and second monkeys in a week from the total number of bananas purchased: 945 bananas − 168 bananas = <<945-168=777>>777 bananas.

7. Since the third monkey eats all the remaining bananas for the day, the third monkey eats 777 bananas / 7 days = <<777/7=110.85714285714286>>111 bananas (approximately) per day.

Note that the third monkey's banana consumption is approximate and not exact due to the remainder from the division (777 / 7). In practicality, we could assume the third monkey eats around 110 bananas per day.

{The final answer is approximately 110 bananas or, more realistically, around 111 bananas for the third monkey each day.}</s>","Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.
The second monkey eats 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas a day.
So the first and the second monkey eat a total of 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 bananas each day.
Hence, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = <<45-24=21>>21 bananas each day.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first part of the hour, Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle. Since half of 500 is 250, Teddy placed 250 pieces during this part of the hour.
2. In the second part of the hour, Teddy started and didn't finish another 500-piece puzzle. However, the question asks for the number of pieces Teddy placed during this hour, not how many he managed to finish.
3. Therefore, the number of pieces Teddy placed during the second part of the hour is the number of pieces he started with, which is 500.
4. To find the total number of pieces Teddy placed during the hour, we add the number of pieces placed in each part of the hour.

{The final answer is 750 pieces}.

Keep in mind that Teddy didn't actually place 750 pieces during the hour, as he didn't finish the second puzzle. The final answer is just the sum of the number of pieces he worked on during the hour.</s>","Teddy did 1/2 * 500 pieces = <<500/2=250>>250 pieces.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of the 15 roses purchased by Jenny. since the cost of one rose is $2, then the cost of 15 roses will be 15 * $2 = $30.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of a dozen roses since she mentioned she spent $15 on roses, but didn't say how many she bought besides the 15. A dozen roses cost $15, so the cost of one rose in this bunch is $15 / 12 = $1.25. This is not the cost of one rose mentioned earlier, which is $2, so there seems to be a discrepancy in the problem. {However, we'll proceed with the given problem based on the $1.25 cost for one rose.)

Step 3: Calculate the number of roses in the $15 bouquet. since one rose costs $1.25, then the number of roses in the $15 bouquet will be $15 / $1.25 = 12 roses.

Step 4: Calculate how much change Jenny will receive with her five $5 bills when she pays the $30 for 15 roses. Change = amount paid - cost of roses = $30 - $30(for roses) = $0.

Step 5: Since she only had quarters for change, let's see how many quarters she has in total, which equals $5 * 4(quarters per bill) = $20.

Step 6: Distribute the $20 change among quarters. Number of quarters = $20 / $0.25(cost per quarter) = 80 quarters.

{The final answer is: Jenny leaves with 80 quarters.}

However, since there was a discrepancy in the problem regarding the cost of one rose, this answer might not be accurate, and the reasoning may not apply to the actual price of the roses Jenny bought. In that case, it's recommended to double-check the problem's information for accuracy.</s>","Jenny has $25 because 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25

                 [/INST] To find out how long Paul will wait for his train in total, we need to calculate the waiting time between each train's arrival and Paul's train's arrival. Here's the step-by-step calculation:
1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. Paul doesn't need to get on this train, so there's no waiting time for him.
2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (10 minutes + 20 minutes = 30 minutes). It stays for a quarter of the time that the first train stayed, so it stays for 5 minutes (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
3. Paul needs to wait for the fourth train, which arrives an hour after the third train leaves. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives (previously calculated that it stays for 0 minutes), so the third train leaves 1 hour after the second train arrives. Paul needs to wait an additional 20 minutes for the fourth train to arrive after the third train leaves, so the total waiting time for Paul is 1 hour + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.

Therefore, {The final answer is: Paul will wait for a total of 80 minutes for his train.}</s>","The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.
So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.

1. Mr. Rogers bought the watch on sale for 75% of the original price: P * 0.75 = $2000.
Solving for P: P = $2000 / 0.75 = $2666.67.

2. Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend for 120% of the price he paid: $2666.67 * 1.2 = $3199.99.

3. The difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid is the profit Mr. Rogers made: P - $3199.99 = ?.

4. To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we first need to determine the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid: $3199.99.

1. We know that one spring creates one new jellyfish every second.
2. Therefore, the number of jellyfish created by five springs working at the same rate in one second is 5.
3. To find out how many jellyfish are created in 4 hours, we first need to determine how many seconds are in 4 hours.
4. We know that 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds. So, 1 hour = 3600 seconds (60 minutes * 60 seconds).
5. We also know that 1 hour = 60 minutes and 4 hours = 4 * 60 minutes = 240 minutes.
6. So, 4 hours = 240 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 14400 seconds.
7. Now, we can calculate how many jellyfish are created by five springs working together in 14400 seconds: Jellyfish = 5 (number of springs) * 1 (jellyfish created per second per spring) * 14400 (number of seconds in 4 hours).

The final answer is: 5 * 1 * 14400 = 72000 jellyfish.</s>","Since an hour has 3600 seconds, if every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, it will create 4*3600 = <<4*3600=14400>>14400 jellyfish in four hours.

2. Number of bananas in the cheaper option (bunches): 12 (from $3.00/ $0.80)
3. Number of bananas Jenny buys individually: 40 / 4 = 10 * 4 = 40
4. Cost of buying individually: 40 * $0.80 = $32
5. Cost of buying in bunches: 10 * $3.00 = $30

Let's denote the number of feet Sam gets as S and the number of feet Harry gets as H.
From the problem statement, we know that:

S + H = 100 (total fence length)
H = S + 60 (Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam)

Now we can write the equation for Harry's fence length in terms of Sam's length:
H = S + 60

Substitute H in the first equation:
S + (S + 60) = 100

Solve for S:
S + S + 60 = 100
2S + 60 = 100
2S = 40
S = 20

Now that we have calculated Sam's fence length as 20 feet.

To find the fence length left for Sam, simply subtract Sam's portion from the total length:

Total fence length = 100
Sam's portion = 20

Leftover for Sam = Total fence length - Sam's portion
Leftover for Sam = 100 - 20

{The final answer is: 80 feet left over for Sam}</s>","Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100
Subtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40
We divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of bikes sold for each type.
- Number of Trekking bikes sold: 300 * 0.5 = 150
- Number of BMX bikes sold: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- Number of MTB bikes sold: 300 - 150 - 45 = 100.5
Since there cannot be a fraction of a bike sold, we'll assume that either 101 MTB bikes were sold or round down to 100 and account for the lost sale in the calculation of earnings below.

Step 2: Calculate the earnings for each type of bike.
- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500.
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * ($500 / 2) = 22,500 * $250 = $5,625.
- Earnings from MTB bikes: 100 * $500 = $50,000 (or $49,500 if assuming 100 MTB bikes were sold instead).

Step 3: Find the total earnings for that month.
Total earnings = $67,500 + $5,625 + $49,500 (or $49,000)
{The final answer is: $118,625 (or $118,125)}</s>","First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts to find the answer:

1. In an hour, the farmer makes 5 bales of hay.
2. In the same hour, the truck picks up 3 bales of hay.

First, let's calculate how many bales are made and picked up in an hour, and then we'll calculate how many bales are left in the field after a 6-hour workday.

Step 1: Find out how many bales are made and picked up per hour:
- Farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
- Truck picks up 3 bales per hour.

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the number of bales made and the number picked up in an hour, which represents the number of bales left in the field after an hour's work.

The difference between bales made and picked up is: 5 (bales made) - 3 (bales picked up) = 2 bales.

So, after an hour of work, there are 2 bales left in the field.

Step 3: Now, let's calculate how many bales are left in the field after a full 6-hour workday.

Since after an hour there are 2 bales left, and the farmer and truck driver work for 6 hours, a total of 12 hours worth of work is done (since there are two workers, they each work for 6 hours).

Therefore, the total number of bales made during the 6-hour workday is: 12 hours * 5 bales/hour = 60 bales.

Since we know that there are 2 bales left after each hour of work, to find the number of bales left in the field after a full 6-hour workday, we just need to account for the 2 bales that are left after the last hour of work: 6 hours * 2 bales + 60 bales = 62 bales.

However, it appears that there is a mistake in the problem, as the number of bales that should be left in the field after a full 6-hour workday is actually 62 bales, not 56 as it might seem if we rely solely on the information presented in the problem without doing the calculation.

{The final answer is 62 bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour workday.}</s>","The farmer makes 5*6= <<5*6=30>>30 bales of hay.
The truck takes away 3*6= <<3*6=18>>18 bales of hay.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of minutes John spends on regular classes per week.
- There are 6 periods in a day for a normal student, and each period lasts 40 minutes.
- So, a regular school day consists of 6 * 40 = <<6*40=240>>240 minutes.
- John goes to class for 5 days a week, so he spends 240 minutes/day * 5 days/week = <<240*5=1200>>1200 minutes/week on regular classes.

Step 2: Calculate the number of minutes John spends on extra classes per week.
- He has to take 2 extra classes each week, and each class is 40 minutes long.
- So, he spends 2 * 40 = <<2*40=80>>80 minutes/week on extra classes.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on learning per week.
- He spends 1200 minutes/week on regular classes, and 80 minutes/week on extra classes.
- So, he spends 1200 + 80 = <<1200+80=1280>>1280 minutes/week on learning.

Step 4: Convert the total number of weekly learning minutes to hours.
- To find the number of hours, divide the total number of minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
- So, he spends 1280 minutes/week ÷ 60 minutes/hour = <<1280/60=21>>21 hours/week on learning. {The final answer is 21 hours/week.}</s>","He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how high the ball goes during each bounce. Since the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its previous height, we can write this relationship as:
height of ball after bounce = 2/3 * height of ball before bounce

Step 2: Let's assume the initial height (before the first bounce) of the ball is 'h' feet. We want to find the height of the ball after the second bounce (i.e., after the first bounce when it hits the ground and then bounces again).

Step 3: The height of the ball after the first bounce is given by:
height after first bounce = 2/3 * height before first bounce (given as 'h')

Step 4: Since the ball will bounce again after reaching the ground, the height after the second bounce will be:
height after second bounce = 2/3 * height after first bounce

Step 5: Substitute the height after the first bounce into the above equation to find the height after the second bounce:
height after second bounce = 2/3 * (2/3 * h)

Step 6: Simplify the equation:
height after second bounce = (2/3)^2 * h

Step 7: Now we want to find the actual height (in feet). We know that the initial height 'h' is given in terms of stories in the mall: 'h' = 3 * 24 = 72 feet. So, we have:
height after second bounce = (2/3)^2 * 72

Step 8: Calculate the height after the second bounce:
height after second bounce = (4/9) * (72)
height after second bounce = 28.89 feet (rounded to two decimal places)

1. First, we need to find out how much meat was left for the Allosaurus. We know that they ate the last 270 kilograms.

The portion that was scavenged by velociraptors was half of what was left after the T-Rex had eaten. So, the portion left for the Allosaurus was the other half.
2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so half of its meat was consumed by the T-Rex. Let x be the original weight of the triceratops.

x/2 = amount of meat eaten by the T-Rex
3. After the T-Rex ate, there was some meat left for the velociraptors to scavenge. We know that they ate half of what remained, and we also know that the Allosaurus ate the remaining half.

Half of the remaining meat was eaten by velociraptors, and half was eaten by the Allosaurus.

(x/2 - half of what T-Rex ate) / 2 = amount of meat eaten by velociraptors
(x/2 - x/2) / 2 = amount of meat eaten by Allosaurus

 x/2 - x/4 = amount of meat left for Allosaurus

 x/4 = amount of meat for Allosaurus

 x = 4x/4

 x = 4x/4 * (1/2) * 2

 x = 4x

 x = 4 * meat_weight_for_Allosaurus

 meat_weight_for_Allosaurus = x/4
4. As we know, half of the meat_weight_for_Allosaurus was eaten by the Allosaurus:

 Allosaurus_eat = meat_weight_for_Allosaurus / 2

 Allosaurus_eat = x/8
5. We also know that half of the remaining meat was eaten by velociraptors after the T-Rex ate:

 Velociraptors_eat = (x/2 - Allosaurus_eat) / 2

 Velociraptors_eat = (x/2 - x/8) / 2

 Velociraptors_eat = (5x/8 - x/8) / 2

 Velociraptors_eat = 4x/16

 Velociraptors_eat = x/4
6. Therefore, the total amount of meat eaten by the T-Rex, velociraptors, and Allosaurus is:

 T-Rex_eat = x/2

 Velociraptors_eat = x/2

 Allosaurus_eat = x/4

 Total_eaten = x/2 + x/2+ x/4

 Total_eaten = 3x/4

                 [/INST] To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the number of shaken cans left after Ellen and her brother took some. Let's work through the problem step by step:

1. Ellen bought a case of 12 sodas and shook up 3 of them.
2. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so she has 11 unshaken sodas left.
3. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 10 shaken sodas and 12 unshaken sodas in the case.
4. Ellen's friend arrived, so there are now three people (Ellen, her brother, and her friend) who could potentially get sprayed with soda from a shaken can.
5. To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed, we need to find the number of shaken sodas she could potentially get:
   - Since there are 13 people in total (Ellen, her brother, and Ellen's friend, plus the initial number of people who came into contact with the shaken sodas), we can assume that one shaken soda was consumed by Ellen, and one was consumed by her brother.
   - So, there are now 10 shaken sodas left, and three people who might be sprayed.
6. Hence, the probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed from a shaken can is:

The final answer is {approximately 33.33% (or 1 out of 3)} assuming equal opportunity for each person to get sprayed, given that one shaken soda has already been assumed to be consumed. However, the probability might change if certain actions, such as Ellen or her brother purposely giving the shaken soda to her friend, are taken into consideration.</s>","First figure out how many unshaken sodas were in the case when Ellen left the room: 12 total sodas - 3 shaken sodas - 1 taken soda = <<12-3-1=8>>8 unshaken sodas.
Next, figure out how many unshaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 unshaken sodas.
Then figure out how many shaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 shaken sodas.
Now add the number of shaken and unshaken sodas to find the total number of sodas left when Ellen's friend came along: 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 sodas
Now divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas to find the decimal probability Ellen's friend gets sprayed: 2/8 = <<2/8=0.25>>0.25
Now multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .25 * 100 = <<.25*100=25>>25%

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem
Two trains depart from a station in opposite directions. train A travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour, while train B travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour. The question asks for the distance between the two trains after 3 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the distance each train covers in 3 hours
train A covers a distance of 60 miles per hour * 3 hours = 180 miles
train B covers a distance of 30 miles per hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

Step 3: Determine the distance between the two trains
Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we can find the distance between them by adding the distances covered by each train.

The final answer is: 180 miles (train A) + 90 miles (train B) = 270 miles. {The final answer is 270 miles}.</s>","Since one train is traveling half the speed of the train traveling 60 miles an hour, that means that train is traveling 60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 miles an hour.
Therefore, to find the distance traveled each hour in total we add both trains' speed together for a total of 60+30=<<90=90>>90 miles traveled each hour.
This means that in 3 hours they will have traveled 90*3= <<90*3=270>>270 miles away from each other.

Number of people helped in 1 hour = 2 people
Number of people helped in 3 hours = 2 people/hour * 3 hours
{The number of people helped in 3 hours is 6 people}

Next, we need to figure out how many people Billy can help in total during the tax season, which lasts from March 1st to April 19th. There are 31 days in March and a total of 45 days for the tax season. Billy takes 20% of his days off, so he works on:

Total working days = 45 days - (0.2 * 45 days)
{The total working days is 36 days}

Finally, we can find out how many people Billy helps during the tax season:

Number of people helped = Number of people helped per day * Total working days
{The number of people helped is 6 people/day * 36 days}
{The final answer is: Billy helps 216 people during the tax season}</s>","First find the number of days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days

Step 2: Each bus carried a specific number of people. Each bus carried 35 people.

Step 3: Each car carried a different number of people. Each car carried 3 people.

Step 4: To find the total number of people in the private cars, we can multiply the number of private cars by the number of people per car: 20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Step 5: To find the total number of people in the buses, we can multiply the number of buses by the number of people per bus: 12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

The biggest waterslide is 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet/minute. To find the ride time for the biggest slide, we divide its length by the sliding speed:

Ride time for biggest slide = Slide length / Sliding speed
= 300 ft / 60 ft/min
= 5 minutes

Now let's find the ride time for the second biggest waterslide. This slide is 240 feet long, and people slide down at 80 feet/minute:

Ride time for second biggest slide = Slide length / Sliding speed
= 240 ft / 80 ft/min
= 3 minutes

To find the difference in ride durations between the two slides, we simply subtract the shorter ride time from the longer one:

Difference in ride duration = Ride time for biggest slide - Ride time for second biggest slide

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours.
- He takes a 2-hour 15-minute break every day, which is equivalent to 2 hours and 15 minutes or 2.25 hours.
- So, the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks per day is 0.5 hours (lunch) + 2.25 hours (break) = 2.75 hours.

Step 2: Multiply the total time spent on lunch and breaks per day by the number of days to find the total time spent over 5 days.
- Total time per day = 2.75 hours
- Number of days = 5
- Total time in 5 days = 2.75 hours/day * 5 days = 13.75 hours

{The final answer is 13.75 hours}.</s>","He has 2 15 minutes breaks per day so together they add up to 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 minutes

1. We know that there are jellyfish in the tank, but we don't have an exact number.
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
4. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
5. When a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

Let's first find out how many large jellyfish change color:

6. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, and we know that 6 jellyfish change color in total, we can find out how many large jellyfish there are by dividing the number of changing jellyfish by the proportion of large jellyfish that change color:

Number of large jellyfish = Number of changing jellyfish / Proportion of changing large jellyfish
= 6 / (1/3)
= 18

So, there are 18 large jellyfish in the tank and 15 of them change color.

To find the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we need to add the number of large jellyfish to the number of small jellyfish. Since there are always blue small jellyfish, there is no need to consider the number of changing small jellyfish.

7. Number of jellyfish = Number of large jellyfish + Number of small jellyfish
= 18 + ?

We don't know the number of small jellyfish, so we cannot determine the exact number of jellyfish in the tank with the given information.

Therefore, the final answer is undefined.</s>","A third of the large jellyfish change color, so there are 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 large jellyfish.

{ She needs a total of $1,600,000 for retirement (20 years * $80,000 per year) }

Step 3: Determine how long Lauren needs to work to save enough for retirement.
To calculate this, we'll divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings.
{ Lauren needs to work for about 80 years ( $1,600,000 ÷ $20,000/year ) }

However, this calculation assumes that Lauren starts saving at this exact moment and doesn't take into account any savings she may have accumulated beforehand. If we assume that she has already saved some money for retirement, this number could be reduced. So, the actual number of years Lauren needs to work might be less than 80.

Therefore, the final answer depends on how much Lauren has saved already. Once we have that information, we can calculate the remaining number of years she needs to work based on her current annual savings rate of $20,000.

{ The final answer is: [remaining number of years to work] }</s>","Lauren plans to live in retirement with 40% of her current salary ($100,000), therefore 40%*$100,000 = $<<40*.01*100000=40000>>40,000
If she wants to save for 20 years, then she will need to save 20 * $40,000 = $<<20*40000=800000>>800,000 to retire
If her current salary is $100,00 and she's saving 20%, then she's able to save $100,000 * 20% = $<<100000*20*.01=20000>>20,000 every year
To reach her desired savings goal ($800,000) she will need to work for another $800,000/$20,000 = <<800000/20000=40>>40 years

Let's call the total number of students in the school X. The number of boys is 240, and 40% of the students are boys. So we can write an equation:

0.4 * X = 240

Now, we can solve for X:

X = 240 / 0.4
X = 600

So, there are 600 students in total in the school. Since 40% are boys and there are 240 boys, then 60% must be girls:

0.6 * X = number of girls
0.6 * 600 = number of girls
360 = number of girls

{The final answer is 360 girls.}</s>","100% - 40% = 60% of the school's population are girls.
Since 40% is equal to 240 students, then 1% is equal to 240/40 = <<240/40=6>>6 students.
Hence, there are 60 x 6 = <<60*6=360>>360 girls.

- Cost of garden soil = $26
- Total cost before discount = $19 (pots) + $26 (garden soil)

Step 3: Subtract the discount amount.
- My mom used a coupon for $7 off.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost after the discount.
- Total cost before discount = $19 (pots) + $26 (garden soil) = $45

2. Find the total height of heels worn by all women. Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so they are wearing a total of 3 * 4 = 12 inches of heels. Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so they are wearing a total of 3 * 2 = 6 inches of heels. The total height of heels worn by all women is 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches.

3. Find the average height of heels by dividing the total height of heels by the total number of women. The average height of heels is 18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches.

1. Soledad plans to hike 125 miles each time she goes out.
2. She goes out twice a day.
3. Therefore, she hikes a total of 125 miles × 2 = <<125*2=250>>250 miles per day.
4. She will be on vacation for the entire month of June.
5. June has 30 days.
6. To find the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June, we multiply the number of miles hiked each day by the number of days in June: 250 miles/day × 30 days = <<250*30=7500>>7500 miles.
7. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day to reach this total, we subtract the number of miles she already hikes per day from the total number of miles she wants to hike: 7500 miles - 250 miles/day = <<7500-250=7250>>7250 miles - 250 miles = <<7250-250=7000>>7000 miles more.

{The final answer is: Soledad needs to hike an additional 7000 miles each month to complete her journey in one month.}

Note: It's important to point out that this calculation assumes Soledad is already covering 250 miles each day, which may not be the case based on the given information. If Soledad cannot complete 9,300 miles within a month by hiking twice a day covering 125 miles each time, then her plan is not feasible, and she would need to adjust her hiking distance or frequency per day to make her goal realistic.</s>","June has 30 days, so Soledad must hike 9,300 miles / 30 days = <<9300/30=310>>310 miles/day
Initially, she wanted to hike 2 times/day * 125 miles/time = <<2*125=250>>250 miles/day
To complete her journey, she must increase her hike by 310 miles/day - 250 miles/day = 60 miles/day

- Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought a total of 12 kg of apples.
- Pierre is giving a quarter of the apples to someone, which leaves Paul and Jacques with the remaining amount.
- Paul wants 1/3 of the remaining apples.
- We want to find out how much James will have left.

Step 2: Calculate the number of apples Pierre gave away.
- Since Pierre gave a quarter of the apples, we can find out how much he gave away by calculating a quarter of 12 kg: 12 kg * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Step 3: Calculate the amountPaul and Jacques have.
- After Pierre gave away 3 kg, the total weight of the apples was 12 kg - 3 kg = 9 kg.

Step 4: Calculate Paul's share.
- Paul wants 1/3 of the remaining apples, which is equal to 9 kg * 1/3 = 3 kg.

Step 5: Calculate James' share.
- Now we know that Paul and Jacques together have 3 kg, so James' share must be the remaining amount: 9 kg - 3 kg = 6 kg.

The final answer is: James will have 6 kg of apples left.</s>","Peter wants 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 kg of apples.
Paul wants 12 * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 kg of apples.

2. She has already spent $4.
3. Anna bought 2 books today.
4. Both books cost the same amount.
5. Anna has $2 left in her budget.

First, let's find out how much Anna spent in total on the 2 books she bought today. Since she had $16 initially, spent $4, and now has $2 left, we can find the cost of each book by subtracting the total amount spent on the books from Anna's initial budget and dividing by the number of books she bought:

Total cost of the 2 books = Anna's initial budget - Amount spent - Remaining budget
= $16 - $4 - $2
= $10

Since both books cost the same amount, the cost of each book is half the total cost:

Cost of each book = Total cost of the 2 books / Number of books
= $10 / 2
= $5

{The final answer is: Each book costs $5.}</s>","Anna had already spent some money, so she started the day with $16 – $4 = $<<16-4=12>>12.
She has money left in the budget, so she spent a total of $12 – $2 = $<<12-2=10>>10 on the books.

4. We need to find a value of y such that 459 is a multiple of 255. Unfortunately, there is no integer value of y that would make this true based on the given information. The problem is inconsistent, as 255 does not blink an integer number of times in 5 minutes and also in 5 minutes it should be able to blink 459 times which is an integer multiple of 255.

                 [/INST] To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we first need to determine how many miles he drives round trip during each visit.

1. We know that it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents' house at a speed of 70 miles per hour (mph).
2. To find the distance John travels during one visit, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time
3. So, the distance for one visit is: 70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

{The distance for one visit is 140 miles}.

4. Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the distance for one visit by the number of visits per month to find the total monthly miles driven.
5. Thus, the monthly miles driven by John are: 140 miles/visit * 2 visits/month = 280 miles/month

Sofie's daily distance = 10 miles
Number of days she walks = 7
Total distance Sofie covers = Daily distance * Number of days

Step 2: Total distance Sofie covers = 10 miles * 7 days = 70 miles

Step 3: The problem states that Sofie walks ""as far as Brian"" in 7 days. Since Sofie covers 70 miles in 7 days, it means that Brian also covers this same distance in those 7 days.

How many : toys ? per hour does ; the fifth worker produce?
                 [/INST] Let's first determine how many toys can be produced by the given number of workers in an hour. We have 2 types of workers:
1. 2 workers producing 6 toys per hour.
2. 3 workers producing 4 toys per hour.

Let's find out the total production of toys per hour:
Total production per hour = (Number of workers producing 6 toys per hour) * (Toys produced per hour by each worker) + (Number of workers producing 4 toys per hour) * (Toys produced per hour by each worker)
Total production per hour = 2 * 6 + 3 * 4 = 12 + 12 = 24 toys per hour

Now, let's determine how many toys the available workers can produce during their 10-hour shift:
Total toys produced during the shift = Total production per hour * Shift duration
Total toys produced during the shift = 24 * 10 = 240 toys

However, the manufacturer still needs to produce an additional 20 toys to complete the order. So, we need to find out how many toys the fifth worker can produce during his/her shift in order to meet the remaining demand:
Let x be the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker.
Then, during their 10-hour shift, the fifth worker would produce:
Toys produced by the fifth worker = x * Shift duration
Toys produced by the fifth worker = x * 10

To find the value of x, we can set up the equation as follows:
Total toys produced by all workers during their shift = Manufactured toys + Remaining toys to be produced
240 = 400 + Toys produced by the fifth worker - 20
220 = Toys produced by the fifth worker
Toys produced per hour by the fifth worker = 220 / Shift duration
Toys produced per hour by the fifth worker = 220 / 10
{The final answer is: The fifth worker produces 22 toys per hour.}</s>","In the first group of workers, each produces 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys.
In the second group of workers, each produces 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys.
Together, these two groups produce 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys.
If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.
The fifth worker therefore produced 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.

2. The weight of Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so y = 0.5 * 60 = 30 pounds.

To find the combined weight of all three dogs, we simply add the weights of Elijah's two dogs and Kory's dog:

The final answer is: x + y + Kory's dog's weight = 15 + 30 + 60 = 105 pounds.

                 [/INST] Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Therefore, the number of stickers Seth had in the beginning is double the number of stickers Luis received.
   {Seth had 2 * stickers for Luis = 2 * (stickers for Luis)}

2. Luis used half of the stickers for himself and gave the other half to Kris. So, the number of stickers Luis had after giving half to Seth is half of the initial number of stickers Seth had.
   {Luis had (1/2) * Seth's stickers}

3. Kris kept 9 stickers from the ones he received from Luis and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. So the number of stickers Kris had after giving the remaining to Rob is the difference between the number of stickers he received and the number he gave to Rob.
   {Kris had (stickers for Kris) = (stickers for Kris) - (stickers for Rob)}

4. We know that Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 stickers to Rob. Thus, the number of stickers Kris received from Luis is the sum of the number he kept and the number he gave to Rob.
   {stickers for Kris = 9 + 7 = 16}

5. Now we know that Luis received half of the stickers Seth had. And the number of stickers Kris received is the sum of the number he kept and the number he gave to Rob. We can set up an equation and solve for ""Seth's stickers"":
   {Seth's stickers = 2 * Luis's stickers}
   {Luis's stickers = (1/2) * Seth's stickers + (stickers for Kris)}
   {Seth's stickers = 2 * [(1/2) * Seth's stickers + 16]}

6. By solving the quadratic equation we get, Seth had 32 stickers initially. {The final answer is: Seth had 32 stickers in the beginning.}</s>","Luis gave 9 + 7 = <<9+7=16>>16 stickers to Kris.

1. First, we need to find out how many M&M's are in the large bags that John bought. We know that each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and an ounce of M&M's contains 30 pieces. So, the number of M&M's in one large bag is: 10 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 300 M&M's.
2. Next, we need to find out how many small bags John can make if he puts 10 M&M's in each small bag. To do this, we divide the total number of M&M's in the large bags by the number of M&M's in each small bag: 300 M&M's / 10 M&M's/small bag = 30 small bags.

Half of the Earth's circumference = 40,000 kilometers / 2
Half of the Earth's circumference = 20,000 kilometers

3. Simplifying the equation, we get: 14 = 2 * V
4. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that V was 7 years old two years ago.

Step 4: To find the number of Easter eggs that Camden painted, we need to first find the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline. 2x = 56, so x = 28. Thus, Arnold and Madeline painted 28 each, for a total of 56 eggs.

Step 5: We also know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's represent the number of Easter eggs Sarah painted as ""y"". Then, Camden painted y + 12 eggs.

Step 6: We have the equation 28 + 30 = Camden's and Sarah's combined total. So, y + 12 = 58.

Step 7: Solving for y, we find that Sarah painted y = 46 Easter eggs. Thus, Camden painted y + 12 = 58 - 46 = 12 more Easter eggs than Sarah.

The final answer is: Camden painted 12 more Easter eggs than Arnold. However, it's important to mention that the problem does not provide information about how many Easter eggs Arnold painted specifically.</s>","Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = <<56-30=26>>26 easter eggs.
Arnold and Madeline each painted 26/2 = <<26/2=13>>13 easter eggs.
Sarah painted (30 - 12)/2 = 18/2 = <<(30-12)/2=9>>9 easter eggs.
Camden painted 9 + 12 = <<9+12=21>>21 easter eggs.
Camden painted 21 - 13 = <<21-13=8>>8 eggs more than Arnold.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total weight of crayons in ounces.
Since Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Step 2: Determine the number of boxes Nik will have and the weight of each box.
There will be 25 boxes (200 crayons ÷ 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes), and each box weighs 8 ounces.

Step 3: Calculate the weight of the boxes.
The weight of all the boxes is 8 ounces per box × 25 boxes = 200 ounces.

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the crayons and boxes in pounds.
Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is (200 ounces for the crayons + 200 ounces for the boxes) / 16 ounces per pound = 25.63 pounds.

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and boxes is 25.63 pounds. {The final answer is 25.63 pounds.}</s>","First find how many boxes Nik needs. 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = <<200/8=25>>25 boxes.

                 [/INST] Step 1: find out how many logs John can make from the tree.
John can make logs out of 80% of the tree. So,
Number of logs = (Percentage of tree cut down) / (100% * Log length)
Number of logs = (80) / (100 * 4)
Number of logs = 20 logs

Step 2: find out how many planks John can get from one log.
John gets 5 planks from each log. So,
Number of planks per log = 5

Step 3: find out how many planks John gets in total.
Number of planks = (Number of logs) * (Planks per log)
Number of planks = 20 logs * 5 planks/log
Number of planks = 100 planks

Step 4: find out how much money John makes from selling all the planks.
Money made = (Number of planks) * (Price per plank)
Money made = 100 planks * $1.2/plank
Money made = $120

The final answer is: John makes a total of $120 from selling all the planks.</s>","He can use 80*.8=<<80*.8=64>>64 feet of the tree.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Valerie earns $5000 per month.
2. Her brother earns 1/2 of Valerie's salary, so his monthly salary is $5000 * 1/2 = $2500.
3. Their combined monthly salary is $5000 (Valerie) + $2500 (brother) = $7500.
4. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her monthly salary is $7500 * 2 = $15,000.
5. While the question asks for the total amount of money they all have together, it doesn't specify that the answer should be in monthly earnings. However, we can calculate the total amount of money they have if we assume it's for a specific period, such as a year. So, for instance:
   - Valerie has $5000 * 12 (months) = $60,000.
   - Her brother's savings is $2500 * 12 = $30,000.
   - Their mother's savings is $15,000 * 12 (months) = $180,000.

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $60,000 (Valerie) + $30,000 (brother) + $180,000 (mother) = $270,000.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the walking distances and rates.
- Grandma walks a total of 3 miles per day.
- She walks 2 miles on the beach.
- She walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Step 2: Determine Grandma's speed on the beach and the sidewalk.
- Grandma's speed on the beach is not given, but we know that on the sidewalk, she walks twice as fast. Let's denote her speed on the beach as ""s_b"" miles per hour. Her speed on the sidewalk is then ""2s_b"" miles per hour.

Step 3: Determine the time Grandma spends on the beach and the sidewalk.
- We know that 40 minutes are spent on the beach. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this into hours: 40 minutes = 0.67 hours.
- Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach, her speed on the beach is given as s_b = 2 miles / 0.67 hours.

Step 4: Determine the time Grandma spends on the sidewalk.
- The total time Grandma spends on the 3-mile walk is the sum of the time on the beach and the time on the sidewalk: 0.67 hours + t_s.
- We know that Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, so the time spent on the sidewalk is t_s = 1 mile / s_s, where s_s = 2s_b is her speed on the sidewalk.

Step 5: Solve for Grandma's speed on the beach.
- First, find her speed on the sidewalk: s_s = 1 mile / (0.67 hours + t_s) = 1 mile / (0.67 hours + 1 mile / s_b)
- To solve for s_b, we can use the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a
- Here, a = -1, b = 1, and c = 0.67: s_b = (-1 ± √(1²-4*-0.67*1)) / (2*-1)
- The positive solution is: s_b = (1 + √(1.69+0.67²)) / 2 ≈ 3.48 miles per hour

Step 6: Calculate the total time Grandma spends on the walk.
- We have s_s = 1 mile / (0.67 hours + 1 mile / 3.48 miles per hour) ≈ 4.17 miles per hour
- The time spent on the sidewalk is t_s = 1 mile / 4.17 miles per hour ≈ 0.24 hours
- The total time spent on the walk is 0.67 hours + 0.24 hours ≈ 0.91 hours

Step 7: Convert the total time from hours to minutes.
- The time spent on the entire walk is approximately 0.91 hours * 60 minutes = 54.7 minutes.

{The final answer is 55 minutes (rounded up from the calculated 54.7 minutes).}</s>","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.

- She wants to save a total of $60.
- The difference between what she has saved and what she wants to save is $60 - $32 = $28.

Step 3: Determine how many more weeks it will take for her to save that amount.
- She saves $4 every week.
- To find out how many more weeks it will take, divide the amount she needs to save by how much she saves per week: $28 / $4/week = 7 weeks.

                 [/INST] To find the temperature of the second bottle after Donny pours 4 ounces from it into his water bottle, we need to use the principle of conservation of energy, which states that the total amount of heat energy before the transfer is equal to the total amount of heat energy after the transfer.

Let's call the temperature of the second bottle ""x"" degrees. The temperature of the 33-degree mug changes by the amount of water poured, which is 4 ounces or 0.25 pounds. The specific heat capacity of water is 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius (or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit). So, the change in temperature for the 33-degree mug is:

Δt_1 = (0.25 pounds / (1 pound × 1.8°F/pound) × (9°F/5°C)) = 15.6°F ≈ 8.1°C

Since the heat energy lost by the first mug is the same as the heat energy gained by the second mug, we have:

Temperature change in the first mug = Temperature change in the second mug

We know that Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40°F. Therefore, after pouring, the temperature of Donny's water bottle must be at least 40°F. Let's call the final temperature of Donny's water bottle T_f.

We can now use the conservation of energy to set up an equation relating the initial temperatures, the amount of heat transferred, and the final temperatures.

First, let's calculate the initial temperatures:
T_1 = 33°C + Δt_1 = 33°C + 8.1°C = 41.1°C = 106.02°F
T_2 = x°C

Since the volumes of the water in the mugs are not stated and we don't know the exact masses of the water in each mug, we can only estimate the temperature change in the second mug Δt_2 based on the change in temperature for the first mug and the fact that some heat was transferred to the second mug. Based on our calculation, Δt_1 is approximately 8.1°C. Heat flows from the hotter object to the cooler one, so the temperature difference between the two objects must have been greater than 8.1°C before the pouring. Therefore, the initial temperature of the second mug, T_2, must have been higher than 41.1°C. At least:

T_2 > 41.1°C

After the transfer of heat, the temperatures change such that the final temperature T_f of Donny's water bottle is at least 40°F:

T_1_initial = T_1 + Δt_1 = 106.02°F + 8.1°F = 114.12°F // This value is not actually obtained during the process
T_2_initial > T_1_initial // Since T1_initial is too high, T2_initial must be even higher
T_f >= 40°F

Since we don't have enough information to determine the initial temperature of the second mug exactly, we cannot find its temperature after the pouring with certainty, but we can say that it must have been hotter than 41.1°C initially to result in a final temperature of at least 40°F for Donny's water bottle.

The final answer is: The temperature of the second bottle must have been higher than 41.1°C initially.</s>","There are 5 total ounces of water because 4 + 1 = <<4+1=5>>5

2. Milkie Cows Limited brings Melanie's father 20 cows per day. In three weeks, there are 21 working days in a 21-day month (for simplicity). So, Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

3. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows, so after receiving 420 cows, the total number of cows on the farm is 50 initial cows + 420 received = 470 cows.

                    Russell orders ? his : favorite bagels online. .  , Each pack , of bagels costs $10.00 ! and : has : 9 bagels ? in the pack.  . If he , orders 4 ; packs ; of bagels, ! he ; will : receive a 10% . discount. ;  After . ordering ? 4 : bags, how much ; will each single ? bagel cost?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Cost of one pack of bagels: Each pack contains 9 bagels, and the cost of one pack is $10.00. To find the cost of one bagel, we need to divide the cost of one pack by the number of bagels in that pack.

Cost of one pack = $10.00
Number of bagels in one pack = 9

Cost of one bagel = Cost of one pack / Number of bagels in one pack
Cost of one bagel = $10.00 / 9
Cost of one bagel ≈ $1.11 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 2: Cost of four packs: Russell orders 4 packs of bagels.

Cost of 4 packs = Cost of one pack * Number of packs
Cost of 4 packs = $10.00 * 4
Cost of 4 packs = $40.00

Step 3: Discount: Russell receives a 10% discount on 4 packs.

Discount amount = Total cost of 4 packs * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $40.00 * 0.1
Discount amount = $4.00

Step 4: Cost of 4 packs after discount: The cost of 4 packs after the discount is the total cost of 4 packs minus the discount amount.

Cost of 4 packs after discount = Total cost of 4 packs - Discount amount
Cost of 4 packs after discount = $40.00 - $4.00
Cost of 4 packs after discount = $36.00

Step 5: Cost of one bagel after ordering 4 bags: To find the cost of one bagel after Russell orders 4 bags, we need to divide the total cost of 4 packs after the discount by the number of bagels Russell will receive (which is 12 bagels from 4 packs).

Cost of 4 packs after discount = $36.00
Total number of bagels in 4 packs = 9 bagels * Number of packs
Total number of bagels in 4 packs = 9 * 4
Total number of bagels in 4 packs = 36 bagels

Cost of one bagel after ordering 4 bags = Cost of 4 packs after discount / Total number of bagels in 4 packs
Cost of one bagel after ordering 4 bags = $36.00 / 36
Cost of one bagel after ordering 4 bags = $1.00

{The final answer is: Each single bagel costs $1.00 after Russell orders 4 packs.}</s>","He orders 4 packs of bagels and each pack costs $10.00 so that's 4*10 = $<<4*10=40.00>>40.00
He orders 4 packs at $40.00 and receives a 10% discount so his discount is 40*.10 = $4.00
The bagels cost $40.00 and he has a $4.00 discount making his total 40-4 = $<<40-4=36.00>>36.00
Each pack of bagels has 9 bagels per pack and he orders 4 packs so that's 9*4 = <<9*4=36>>36 bagels
His order total was $36.00 and there are 36 bagels so each bagel costs 36/36 = $<<36/36=1.00>>1.00

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Gomer ate less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Let X be the number of potatoes required to make one scoop of mashed potatoes. Given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, we have:
3(X - 3) = 3 - 1

Solving the above equation, we get:
X = 6

Now we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. Since Gomer ate less than 23 scoops, we have:
Number of potatoes = Scopings * Number of scoops

We know that 1 scoop requires 6 potatoes, and Gomer ate less than 23 scoops:
Number of potatoes = < 23 * 6

Since Gomer ate less than 23 scoops, the number of potatoes he ate is less than 138 (23 * 6), which is a positive number. Therefore, the only possible integer solution for the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate lies in the range 1 to 22 (since 1 scoop is the smallest possible quantity and 23 scoops is the largest possible quantity given the given information).

To find the exact number of scoops, we can test each number within this range to determine which one gives us a number of potatoes consumed that is less than 23 * 6:

Trying with 1 scoop:
Number of potatoes = 1 * 6 = 6
This is not less than 23 * 6

Trying with 2 scoops:
Number of potatoes = 2 * 6 = 12
This is less than 23 * 6

So, the final answer is: Gomer ate 2 scoops (or 12 potatoes) of mashed potatoes.</s>","5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes is 23-5=<<23-5=18>>18 scoops of mashed potatoes.
3 less than 6 potatoes is 6-3=<<6-3=3>>3 potatoes.
1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes is 3-1=<<3-1=2>>2 scoops of mashed potatoes.
Thus, if Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, and it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, then Gomer ate 18*(3/2)=<<18*(3/2)=27>>27 potatoes.

Eggs consumed in first phase: 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs
Eggs consumed in second phase: 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the number of eggs consumed during both phases to find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days:

Total eggs needed = Eggs in first phase + Eggs in second phase
Total eggs needed = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in one dozen, we can calculate how many dozens of eggs Chester needs:

Total dozens of eggs = Total eggs needed / Number of eggs in one dozen
Total dozens of eggs = 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dokas

{The final answer is 20 dozens of eggs.}</s>","He starts off eating 3 eggs a day for 30 days for a total of 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 eggs

1. We know that there are 17 green jellybeans, and there are twice as many red jellybeans as green. So, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.
2. Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is the total number of jellybeans minus the number of green and red jellybeans: 60 - 17 - 34 = 60 - 51 = 9.

                 [/INST] To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. We know that the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9.
2. The total number of passengers on the bus is 84.
3. Let's find out how many men and women are on the bus based on the given ratio.

First, let's determine the total number of parts in the ratio: 5 parts for men + 9 parts for women = 14 parts.

Next, we can find the number of men and women on the bus by dividing the total number of passengers by the total number of parts in the ratio and multiplying each part by the corresponding number of passengers:

Number of men = 5 parts * (Total number of passengers / Total number of parts) = 5 * (84 / 14) = 28
Number of women = 9 parts * (Total number of passengers / Total number of parts) = 9 * (84 / 14) = 36

Therefore, there are 28 men and 36 women on the bus initially.

4. However, we know that 20 women have gotten off at the next stop. So, we need to find out how many women remain on the bus.

We begin by calculating the total number of passengers that remain on the bus:

Total remaining passengers = Total initial passengers - Women who got off
Total remaining passengers = 84 - 20 = 64

Next, we can find the number of women that remain on the bus:

Number of women remaining = Number of women on the bus * (Total remaining passengers / Total initial passengers)
Number of women remaining = 36 * (64 / 84) ≈ 26.07

Since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we round down to the nearest whole number:

Number of women remaining = 26.

So, there are 26 women left on the bus.

To summarize:

Given the problem, we deduced that there were initially 28 men and 36 women on the bus, but since 20 women alighted at the next stop, there are now only 26 women left on the bus.
{The final answer is 26 women}</s>","The total ratio representing the number of women on the bus is 5+9=<<5+9=14>>14
The fraction from the ratio representing the number of women is 9/14, and since the total number of passengers representing the full ratio is 84, there are 9/14*84=<<9/14*84=54>>54 women on the bus.

Step 1: Find out how many sunflowers Faraday sells from one sunflower and one bouquet per day.
- Selling price of one sunflower = $2
- Number of sunflowers in one bouquet = 12
- Selling price of one bouquet = $8

Sunflowers sold from one sunflower per day = 1 sunflower = 1 * 12 = 12 sunflowers
Sunflowers sold from one bouquet per day = 1 bouquet = 12 * 12 = 144 sunflowers

Total sunflowers sold per day = Sunflowers sold from one sunflower + Sunflowers sold from one bouquet
Total sunflowers sold per day = 12 + 144 = 156 sunflowers

Step 2: Calculate how many sunflowers Faraday sells in total after 3 days.
Daily earnings from sunflowers = $26
Daily earnings from bouquets = $56
Total daily earnings = $26 + $56 = $82

Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = Total daily sunflowers * Number of days
Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = 156 * 3 = 468 sunflowers

{The final answer is: Faraday was able to sell 468 sunflowers after 3 days.}</s>","Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.

Adam can buy rocks costing $5 each. So, the number of rocks he can buy is $100 / $5 = <<100/5=20>>20 rocks.

Step 2: Calculate how much Adam makes by selling each rock.
Adam sells each rock for $7. So, the profit he makes on selling each rock is $7 - $5 = $<<7-5=2>>2.

Step 3: Calculate the total profit Adam can make by selling all his rocks.
The total profit Adam can make is $2 for each rock he sells * number of rocks he has. So, the total profit is $2 * 20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Adam makes by selling 60% of his inventory.
Selling 60% of the inventory means selling $0.6 * $40 = $<<0.6*40=24>>24 worth of rocks.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the rocks Adam still has in inventory.
Since Adam couldn't sell $100 worth of rocks, the cost of the remaining rocks is $100 - $<<24=20*5+24=74>>74.

Step 6: Calculate the loss Adam incurs.
The loss is the difference between the cost of the remaining rocks and the amount of money Adam made by selling 60% of his inventory. Loss = $74 - $24 = $<<74-24=50>>50. {The final answer is $50.}</s>","He can buy 20 rocks because 100 / 5 = <<100/5=20>>20

                 [/INST] To find out how many days it takes Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the number of days required for each size of picture scenes and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many days it takes Lauren to draw one large-sized picture scene, one medium-sized picture scene, and one small-sized picture scene respectively.

1. Large-sized picture scenes: Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day. So, the number of days required to draw one large-sized picture scene is:
   Days required for one large-sized picture scene = 1 day / 5 large-sized picture scenes per day = 1 day / 5 ≈ 0.2 days

2. Medium-sized picture scenes: Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day. So, the number of days required to draw one medium-sized picture scene is:
   Days required for one medium-sized picture scene = 1 day / 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day = 1 day / 6 ≈ 0.17 days

3. Small-sized picture scenes: Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. So, the number of days required to draw one small-sized picture scene is:
   Days required for one small-sized picture scene = 1 day / 7 small-sized picture scenes per day = 1 day / 7 ≈ 0.14 days

Now, we can find out the total number of days required to draw all the picture scenes for the project.

Total picture scenes = 45 large-sized picture scenes + 36 medium-sized picture scenes + 49 small-sized picture scenes
                   = 120 picture scenes

We have already found out the number of days required to create one large-sized picture scene, one medium-sized picture scene, and one small-sized picture scene. So, we can calculate the total number of days required as follows:

Total number of days required = Number of large-sized picture scenes * Days required for one large-sized picture scene
                          + Number of medium-sized picture scenes * Days required for one medium-sized picture scene
                          + Number of small-sized picture scenes * Days required for one small-sized picture scene

Total number of days required = 45 * 0.2 + 36 * 0.17 + 49 * 0.14
                          = 9 + 6.12 + 6.96
                          = 16.08 ≈ 16 days

At 7 large-sized picture scenes per day, 49 large-sized scenes will take 49/7 = <<49/7=7>>7 days.
Altogether, the entire project will take 9 + 6 +7 = <<9+6+7=22>>22 days to complete.

Step 4: Since Jen has 3 fish, she spends $1 * 3 = $3 on food for her fish every day.

Step 5: To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in the month of May, we need to know how many days there are in May.

                 [/INST] To find the average speed of Sid, we first need to find his speed during each segment of the trip and then find the average of those speeds. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

Segment 1:
Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours.
Speeds are given in miles per hour (mph), so the formula for speed is:
Speed = Distance / Time

Speed in segment 1 = 110 miles / 2 hours
Speed in segment 1 = 55 mph

Segment 2:
Sid traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours.
Speed in segment 2 = 140 miles / 3 hours
Speed in segment 2 = 46.67 mph (rounded to two decimal places)

Average Speed:
To find the average speed during the entire trip, we add the distances traveled during each segment and divide by the total time.

Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average Speed = Total distance / Total time
Average Speed = 250 miles / 5 hours

Average Speed = 50 mph

{The final answer is: The average speed Sid traveled was 50 mph.}</s>","After traveling 110 miles at first, Sid traveled 110 + 140 = <<110+140=250>>250 miles in total
Since he spends 3 hours traveling after the first 2 hours, he traveled 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 hours
On average, Sid traveled 250 miles / 5 hours = <<250/5=50>>50 miles per hour.

                 [/INST] To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we first need to determine the probability of each ticket winning independent of the other. Let's call the probability of the first ticket winning ""p"" and the probability of the second ticket winning ""q"".

We're given that Mark's first lottery ticket has a 20% chance of winning, so p = 0.2.

We're also told that the second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win. Since the probability of an event is multiplied by three for three independent and identical trials, we have q = 3p.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we use the formula for the probability of two independent events:

P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)

Substituting the values for p and q:

P(both tickets are winners) = p x q
                                         = 0.2 x 3p
                                         = 0.6p

Since p is given in percentage, we can convert p to a decimal:

p = 0.2 x 100% = 0.2

Now we can find the probability of both tickets winning as a percentage:

P(both tickets are winners) = 0.6p = 0.6 x 0.2 = 0.12 or 12%

{The final answer is 12%}.</s>","First triple 20% to find the second ticket's chance of winning: .2 * 3 = <<.2*3=.6>>.6

1. Carlos collected x seashells.
2. Jim collected z = x + 5 seashells.
3. Carrey collected y = 0.5x seashells.
4. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves.

We need to find out how many seashells each person got after dividing them equally. Let's first find the total number of seashells they gathered.

Total Seashells = x + z + y

Since they divided the seashells equally, we have:

x + z + y = 3x

This equation implies that x = y. Now, we have:

2x + 5 + x = 3x

Solving for x, we get:

3x = 2x + 5
x = 5

So, Carlos collected 5 seashells. We also know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 10 seashells. Carrey collected half of what Carlos collected, so Carrey collected 2.5 seashells, which isn't possible as we can't divide seashells into halves, fraction or a decimal. This contradicts the problem and indicates that it's inconsistent.

Step 2: Calculate the profit from selling one mobile device bought on Monday.
 The profit from selling one mobile device is the difference between the selling price and the buying price: $40 - $20 = $20.

Step 3: Calculate the total profit from selling all the mobile devices bought on Monday.
 Linus bought 2 devices on Monday. So the total profit from selling all the devices bought on Monday is 2 × $20 = $40.

1. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. We'll represent Carl's height as C and his brother Ned's height as N. Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, C = N + 1.
2. Isabel is two feet shorter than Carl, so Isabel's height is C - 2.
3. From the first piece of information, we have Carl's cane length equal to the product of his height and 0.5: C * 0.5.

Now, let's find Carl's height from the given information about him and his brother Ned, and then calculate the length of Carl's cane.

1. As determined in step 1, Carl's height (C) is one foot taller than his brother's height (N): C = N + 1.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel: N = Isabel - 2.
3. Given that Isabel is 7 feet tall: Isabel = 7.
4. Substitute Isabel's value into the equation for Ned's height: N = 7 - 2 = 5.
5. Now that we have Carl's height and his brother's height, we can find Carl's cane length (C * 0.5).

{The final answer is: Carl's cane is 5 feet and a half (5.5) long.}

Here is a visual representation of this problem:
1. Height of Carl: C (represented as 6 feet for simplicity)
2. Height of Ned: N (represented as 5 feet for simplicity)
3. Height of Isabel: Isabel (represented as 7 feet for simplicity)

Therefore, Carl's cane, which is half as long as he is tall, is 5.5 feet long (5 feet + 0.5 feet).</s>","If Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, then Ned is 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 feet tall.

                 [/INST] To find out how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy the energy needs of one person, and then multiply that by the number of people.

We know that one bottle of juice can cover 20% of a person's daily energy demand. So, we need to find out how many bottles a person needs to drink to meet their 100% energy demands.

1 bottle = 20% of a day's energy needs
Let X be the number of bottles needed for 100% energy needs
X = 100% / 20% = 5 bottles

So, five bottles of Hortex juice are required to meet the daily energy needs of one person. To meet the energy needs of all 2300 people, we need to produce:

Total number of bottles = Number of people × Bottles per person
Total number of bottles = 2300 × 5
Total number of bottles = 11,500 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many days it would take to produce enough juices to meet the energy needs of all 2300 people:

Total number of bottles required = 11,500
Number of bottles produced per day = 4200
Number of days = Total number of bottles required / Number of bottles produced per day
Number of days = 11,500 / 4200
Number of days ≈ 2.74 (This is not a whole number, but since we can't produce a fraction of a bottle, we would need to round up to the next whole number.)

The final answer is: Hortex would have to produce approximately 13,050 bottles (5 days * 4200 bottles/day) to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. Note that this is a rough estimate and takes into account the daily production capacity of Hortex. In real life, Hortex might need to produce more than this to account for inefficiencies, breakdowns, etc.</s>","Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.

To cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles of juices.

                    question:
                    Abraham : owns ! 80 , square meters , of unused land. He ? sold . half : of the land , for . $50, . and ; after a month, ! he sold another . 1/4 . of his ? land for $30. He . then ? sold : the remaining land for $3 ! per ? square ; meter. How much ; money will he be . able to earn , after ; selling ! all his unused , land?
                 [/INST] Let's first find out how much land Abraham sold in each transaction:

1. He sold half of the land (80 square meters / 2 = 40 square meters) for $50. To find the price per square meter, we divide the money earned by the number of square meters sold: $50 / 40 = $1.25 per square meter.

2. He sold one quarter of his land (80 square meters / 4 = 20 square meters) for $30. The price per square meter here is $1.5 ($30 / 20).

Since we have the prices per square meter for all the land sold, we can calculate the total amount of money earned by multiplying each price per square meter by the number of square meters in the corresponding transaction and summing the results:

Total earning = (Price per square meter in transaction 1 * Square meters sold in transaction 1) + (Price per square meter in transaction 2 * Square meters sold in transaction 2) + (Price per square meter in transaction 3 * Square meters sold in transaction 3)

Let's calculate the square meters sold in transaction 3:
- Abraham had 80 square meters in total, and he sold half (40 square meters) and one quarter (20 square meters), which sums up to 60 square meters.
- Therefore, he had 20 square meters left in transaction 3.

Now, we can put everything together:

Total earning = ($1.25 * 40) + ($1.5 * 20) + ($3 * 20)

Total earning = $52 + $30 + $60

Total earning = $142

{The final answer is $142}.</s>","Abraham sold 1/2 x 80= <<1/2*80=40>>40 square meters of his unused land.
After a month, he sold 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 square meters of his land.
So, the total land he already sold is 40+10= <<50=50>>50 square meters of his land.
He has 80 - 50 = <<80-50=30>>30 remaining land to be sold at $3 per square meter.
So he earned $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90 for that land.
Therefore, he earned a total of $50 + $30 + $90 = $<<50+30+90=170>>170.

Geb is 10 years less than half the age of Haley. Haley is 26 years old.

Step 2: Find half the age of Haley.
Half the age of Haley = Age of Haley / 2 = 26 / 2 = 13 years.

Step 3: Subtract 10 years from half the age of Haley to find Geb's age.
Geb's age = Half the age of Haley - 10 = 13 - 10 = 3 years.

1. Lamar found 5 eggs.
2. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so she found 5 × 2 = 10 eggs.
3. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
4. Mei found half as many eggs as Charlie, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now let's calculate the total number of eggs found by all finders: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 23 eggs.

{The final answer is}: Subtracting the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs Cole hid, we have 3 dozen eggs = 3 × 12 = 36 eggs. So, 36 - 23 = 13 eggs are still hidden in the yard.</s>","Cole hides 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 eggs.

1. Number of apartments in the first two complexes: Each complex has 200 apartments. So, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is 2 * 200 = <<2*200=400>>400 apartments.

2. Number of apartments in the third complex: The third complex is 60% larger than the other two combined. So, the number of apartments in the third complex is 400 * 1.6 = <<400*1.6=640>>640 apartments.

3. Total number of apartments: The total number of apartments John collects garbage from is 400 + 640 = <<400+640=1040>>1,040.

4. Amount collected per apartment per week: John gets paid $0.40 for collecting garbage from each apartment once a week.

5. Total amount collected per week: To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to find the total amount collected from all 1,040 apartments. Since he gets $0.40 for each apartment and visits each apartment once a week, his weekly income is 1,040 * $0.40.

{The final answer is: $416}

Note: We rounded to the nearest whole number as $0.40 cannot be expressed as a dollar amount exactly without decimal points. However, if we want an exact answer, the week's earnings for John would be $1,040 * $0.40 = $416.00.</s>","The first two complexes have 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 apartments

So he goes to 640+400=<<640+400=1040>>1040 apartments each time
That means he visits 1040*3=<<1040*3=3120>>3120 apartments every week

                 [/INST] Let's denote the initial amount of fruits produced by a 1-year-old avocado tree as x.

Then, we're given the following information:

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits, so the number of fruits produced during these 5 years is 5x (since each year produces x fruits).
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so during its 6th year it produces 3x fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so during its 7th year it produces 7x fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fewer fruits than a 10-year-old tree, so during its 8th year it produces (10x - 200) fruits.
5. During the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so during its 10th year it produces 20x fruits.

To find the total number of fruits produced during the tree's entire 10-year life, we can sum up the fruits produced during each year:

x (1st year) + 5x (5th year) + 3x (6th year) + 7x (7th year) + (10x - 200) (8th year) + 0 (9th year) + 20x (10th year)

Combining the terms:

5x + 3x + 7x + (10x - 200) + 0 + 20x

Simplifying and solving for x:

5x + 3x + 7x + 10x - 200 + 0 + 20x = 41x - 200
41x = 200 + 20x
21x = 200
x = 200 / 21 ≈ 9.52

Since avocado trees can't actually exist with 0.52 years, we'll assume that the tree was actually 10 years old when it started bearing fruits. In this case, the total amount of fruits it will produce during its entire life is:

5 * initial production (from age 1-5) + 10th year production
5 * 9.52 + 20x = 5 * 9.52 + 20 * 9.52
≈ 51.83 * 20 = ≈ 1036.6

Since trees can't actually produce a fraction of fruits, we round the answer down to 1036 fruits.

Therefore, {The final answer is 1036 fruits}.</s>","At 5 years it produces 50 fruits
At 6 years it produces 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 fruits.
At 7 years, it produces 50 * 7 = <<50*7=350>>350 fruits
At 10 years, it produces 50 * 20 = <<50*20=1000>>1000 fruits
At 8 years, it produces 200 fewer fruits than at 10 years, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits
During 10 years, an avocado tree can produce a total of 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = <<50+150+350+800+1000=2350>>2350 fruits

                 [/INST] Let's denote the length of the blue rope as x, and the length of the red rope as y, and the length of the yellow rope as z.

According to the problem, we have two equations:
1. y = 4x  (The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.)
2. z = x + 7  (The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.)

We also have the third equation from the problem that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
y + x + z = 37

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

First, we'll express y in terms of x from the first equation:
y = 4x

We can also express z in terms of x from the second equation:
z = x + 7

Now, let's substitute the expressions for y and z into the third equation:

(4x) + x + (x + 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
5x + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the length of the blue rope:
x = 6 centimeters

Using the second equation: z = x + 7:
z = 6 + 7 = 13 centimeters

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope using the first equation:
y = 4x:
y = 4 * 6 = 24 centimeters

{The final answer is: The length of the red rope is 24 centimeters.}</s>","Let Y = the length of the yellow rope in centimeters

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given three times as much money as Ronnie.
3. After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5th of her initial amount.

Let's define X as the amount of money given to Rissa. Since Rissa received three times as much as Ronnie, Ronnie received X/3.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5th of her initial amount. This can be written as X = 4/5 *Initial Amount for Rissa.

Now, let's find the amount of money given to their little sister by both Ronnie and Rissa:
- The amount given by Ronnie: Ronnie gave an equal amount to his sister, so Ronnie gave X/3.
- The amount given by Rissa: Rissa initially had X, and after giving an equal amount to their little sister, she was left with 4/5th of her initial amount, so Rissa gave X - (4/5 * X) = 4/5 * X = X * (4/5) = X * (2/3).

Since the amount given by both Ronnie and Rissa to their little sister is equal, we have:
X/3 + X * (2/3) = X * (1/2)

Solving the equation X/3 + 2X/3 = X/2
Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2X/3 + 2X/3 = X
3X/3 = X
X = 3X/3
X = 3X/3 * (3/3)
X = 3X

Since X is the amount of money Rissa received and Ronnie received X/3, we can conclude that Ronnie received $5 and Rissa received $15.

So, after giving equal amounts of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with $15 * (4/5) = $12, and Ronnie is left with $5.

Therefore, Ronnie has $5 left. {The final answer is: $5}</s>","Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.

Since Ronnie had given the same amount as Rissa, then Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $<<5-3=2>>2.

Step 2: Half of the mural is yellow. Since we don't know the total size of the mural, we can't determine the exact amount of paint used for yellow. So we cannot find the amount of red paint directly from the given information.

Step 3: However, we do know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural. Since half of the mural is yellow, the other half must consist of the equal parts of red, white, and purple.

Step 4: Let's assume that each of the equal parts represents an amount 'x' of paint. Then, the total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple combined would be 3x (since there are three non-yellow colors).

Step 5: The mural used a total of 12 pints of paint. So, 3x = 12. Solving for x, we have x = 4 pints. This means that each of the three equal parts is 4 pints.

Step 6: Since there are equal parts of red, white, and purple, there are 4 pints of red paint in the mural.

Therefore, the final answer is: {There are 4 pints of red paint in the mural}.</s>","Half the mural is yellow, so the other half took 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pints of paint.

Living room area = Area of one bedroom * 5
Living room area = 240 square feet * 5
Living room area = 1200 square feet

Step 3: Calculate the area of all the bedrooms.
Total area of bedrooms = Number of bedrooms * Area of one bedroom
Total area of bedrooms = 4 * 240 square feet
Total area of bedrooms = 960 square feet

Step 4: Calculate the area of the rest of the house.
Area of the rest of the house = Total house area - Total area of bedrooms
Area of the rest of the house = 1000 square feet - 960 square feet
Area of the rest of the house = 40 square feet

Step 5: Calculate the total area of the house.
Total area of the house = Total area of bedrooms + Area of the rest of the house
Total area of the house = 960 square feet + 40 square feet
Total area of the house = 1000 square feet

The final answer is: The total area of the house is 1000 square feet.</s>","The bedrooms are each 20*12=<<20*12=240>>240 square feet
So in total the bedrooms are 240*4=<<240*4=960>>960 square feet
The living room is 240*5=<<240*5=1200>>1200 square feet
So in total the house is 1200+1000+960=<<1200+1000+960=3160>>3160 square feet

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that on Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

Step 2: Starting from Tuesday through Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before.

Step 3: Let's find the number of clouds Alice counts on Tuesday. We know that on Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds as on Monday, so:
Clouds on Tuesday = 2 * Clouds on Monday
Clouds on Tuesday = 2 * 3
Clouds on Tuesday = 6

Step 4: Similarly, on each subsequent day, she counts double the number of clouds from the previous day, so:
Clouds on Wednesday = 2 * 6 = 12
Clouds on Thursday = 2 * 12 = 24
Clouds on Friday = 2 * 24 = 48

Step 5: To find the total number of clouds Alice counts across all five days, we can simply add up the number of clouds she counts on each day:
Total clouds = Clouds on Monday + Clouds on Tuesday + Clouds on Wednesday + Clouds on Thursday + Clouds on Friday
Total clouds = 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
Total clouds = 85

{The final answer is: Alice will have counted 85 clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days.}</s>","On Monday Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds in the sky, and double that on Tuesday, 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 puffs of clouds.
On Wednesday she sees twice that amount, 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 puffs of clouds.
On Thursday she sees twice that amount, 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 puffs of clouds.
On Friday she sees twice the amount of the day before, 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 puffs of clouds.
In total, across all five days, she sees 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = <<3+6+12+24+48=93>>93 total cloud puffs.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that a regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12.
2. There's a special offer for a larger box with 20% more pods, which is priced the same.

First, let's find out how many pods are in the larger box:

3. Since the larger box has 20% more pods than the regular box of 100 pods, we can find the number of pods in the larger box by multiplying the number of pods in the regular box by 1.2 (1 + 0.2 = 1.2): 100 * 1.2 = <<100*1.2=120>>120 pods

Next, we'll find out how many dishwasher cycles we can run given a budget of $1. Since each cycle uses 1 pod and the price per pod is unknown:

4. Let's first find the cost per pod in a regular box of 100 pods. We know the cost is $12 for the whole box, so the cost per pod is $12/100 = $<<12/100=0.12>>0.12.

5. Given a budget of $1, we'll find out how many pods we can buy: $1 / $0.12 ≈ 8.33, which means we can buy 8 pods ($0.12*8=<<0.12*8=0.96>>0.96, rounded up to the nearest pod, since we cannot use a fraction of a pod).

Now, we'll calculate how many dishwasher cycles we can run with the larger box of 120 pods:

6. Divide the number of pods in the larger box by the number of pods used per cycle: 120 / 1 = <<120/1=120>>120 cycles

So, {The final answer is: 120 dishwasher cycles can be run for $1 using the new larger box of dishwasher pods.}</s>","If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods
If the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods
If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10
If 1 cycle costs $0.10, then for $1 I could run $1/$0.1 = 10 cycles

                 [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20-dollar bills from the bank. So he starts with $1000 ÷ $20 = <<1000/20=50>>50 bills.
2. He loses 10 bills, so he now has 50 - 10 = <<50-10=40>>40 bills.
3. Then he uses half of his remaining bills to pay for a service, so he uses 40 ÷ 2 = <<40/2=20>>20 bills.
4. After that, he triples his money, so he now has 40 × 3 = <<40*3=120>>120 dollars.
5. He then converts all of his money into 5-dollar bills. To find out how many 5-dollar bills he has, we need to find out how many 5-dollar bills make up 120 dollars: 120 ÷ $5 = <<120/5=24>>24 bills.

He triples his money which gives him 20*3=<<20*3=60>>60 bills

Step 2: In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the first half. Let's denote the number of goals scored by team B in the first half as X. Then, team A scores R(3) = X/4 goals in the second half.

Step 3: The total number of goals scored by team B in the match is the sum of the goals scored in the first and second halves. However, since we don't have the exact value of X, we cannot determine the total number of goals scored by team B directly.

Step 4: The total number of goals scored by team A in the match is the sum of the goals scored in the first and second halves.

Total goals for team A = Goals in first half + Goals in second half

                 [/INST] To determine how many days the teacher can use the current piece of chalk before having to recycle it, we first need to find out how much chalk is left. We know that the teacher used up 45% of a 5-inch piece of chalk on Monday.

1. Find the amount of chalk used on Monday: 5 inches * 0.45 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher wants to use only 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find out how long a piece of chalk lasts for him under normal circumstances.

2. Calculate the length of a chalk piece that lasts one day: 5 inches * 0.2 = 1 inch

Now, we need to find out how many inches of chalk are left in the current piece, considering that the teacher used 2.25 inches on Monday.

3. Subtract the used chalk from the original piece: 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

To find out how many days the teacher can use the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk, we divide the length of the remaining chalk by the length of a chalk piece that lasts one day.

4. Determine the number of days left before recycling: 2.75 inches / 1 inch = 2.75 days

Since we cannot count fraals of a day, we have to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the teacher has approximately 2 days left before having to recycle the current piece of chalk.

{The final answer is: The teacher has approximately 2 more days before having to recycle the current piece of chalk.}</s>","The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.

The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.

2. One-third of the girls are on varsity. So, the number of girls on varsity is 12 girls * (1/3) = 12/3 = 4 girls.

3. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity. So, the number of boys on varsity is 12 boys * (1/4) = 12/4 = 3 boys.

4. To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students: 24 students - 4 girls (in varsity) - 3 boys (in varsity) = 15 students.

First, let's identify the number of teeth that the dentist drills and caps:

1. The dentist drills 4 teeth.
2. The dentist caps 7 teeth, and since each cap replaces one tooth, the dentist also removes and replaces 7 teeth.

Therefore, the dentist works on a total of 4 (drilled teeth) + 7 (replaced teeth) = <4+7=11> [11] teeth.

Now we need to calculate the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes. James initially has 30 teeth, so the percentage is:

{The final answer is (11/30) * 100% = 36.67%}

It's important to note that the percentage is approximately 36.67%, since we're dealing with a finite number of teeth (30 for James, 11 for the dentist). In practical terms, this percentage would represent the proportion of James' teeth that the dentist worked on during this visit.</s>","First find the total number of teeth the dentist caps: 4 teeth + 7 teeth = <<4+7=11>>11 teeth

Wendy's age in 25 years = Wendy's age + 25 = 5 * (Colin's age + 7)

4. Now, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is at that time. We can set up an equation to find Colin's age:
Colin's age in 25 years = (1/3) * Wendy's age in 25 years

5. Substituting Wendy's age in 25 years from the previous step into this equation:
Colin's age in 25 years = (1/3) * (5 * (Colin's age + 7))

6. We have two equations with two unknowns, so we can solve for Colin's current age by solving this system of equations:
5 * (Colin's age + 7) = Wendy's age in 25 years
Colin's age in 25 years = (1/3) * (5 * (Colin's age + 7))

Solving these equations simultaneously will give us Colin's current age:

After solving the system of equations, we find that the current age of Colin is 10.

{The final answer is: Colin is currently 10 years old.}</s>","Let x be Colin's age now.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the total amount of money Bob spends on books.
Bob spends $27,000 on books.

Step 2: Determine the cost of buying books for one school.
Bob can buy 100 books for $5,000.
Cost per school = Cost of books for one purchase

Step 3: Find out how many books Bob can buy for one school with $5,000.

Step 4: Calculate the number of books Bob can buy for each school by dividing the total amount of money spent on books by the cost of one school's worth of books.

Number of books per school = Total amount spent on books / Cost per school

Step 5: Perform the calculation:

Number of books per school = $27,000 / $5,000
Number of books per school = 5.4 books

Since Bob can't buy a fraction of a book, he can buy 5 books for one school and still have $50 left over. Therefore, he buys 6 books in total and distributes them across 3 schools.

Therefore, {The final answer is: Bob can buy approximately 1.67 books per school, but due to the rounding constraint, he buys 2 books for 2 schools and 4 books for the third school.}

However, it's important to note that the provided information in the question seems to contain a mistake as the given number of books Bob can buy with $5,000 ($100 worth of books) is not equal to 5 books; it is 100 books. This inconsistency in information leads to the ambiguity and a calculation that doesn't fit the conditions given.

Therefore, we recommend checking the problem statement for accuracy before calculating further.</s>","He spends 27000/3=$<<27000/3=9000>>9000

                 [/INST] Step 1: Analyze the given information and identify the number of apples Newton brought home.

- Initially, two apples fell from the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head. This leaves us with 1 apple.
- Newton picked up the remaining 1 apple and threw it back into the tree, causing 5 apples to fall. So now, we have 1 apple (thrown) + 5 apples (fell) = 6 apples.
- Newton picked up these new apples and put all but one in his pocket. So, he left 1 apple at the tree, making it a total of 7 apples (6 he picked up + 1 he left).
- The last round of apple dropping resulted in 6 apples falling from the tree. Newton picked up these apples, making a total of 7 + 6 = 13 apples he had.
- Finally, Newton picked up all the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.

Step 2: Add up all the apples Newton took home.

Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour.

Step 2: Determine how many snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate how many snowballs are made and melted in an hour.
Jay makes 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes, so in an hour (60 minutes), 2 snowballs melt, which is equal to 40 minutes. Jay can make snowballs for (60 minutes) - (40 minutes) = <<60-40=20>>20 minutes continuously before needing to replenish the ones that melting.

Step 4: Calculate how long it takes Jay to make 60 snowballs.
To determine how long it takes Jay to make 60 snowballs, divide the total number of snowballs needed by how many he can make in an hour. Jay needs 60 snowballs, and he can make 20 snowballs in an hour, so he needs 60/20 = <<60/20=3>>3 hours. Since Jay can only work uninterrupted for 20 minutes before needing to make replacements, he would need to work for slightly longer than 3 hours to make 60 snowballs. In fact, he would need to work for approximately 3 hours and 12 minutes (or 108 minutes).

The problem states that Digimon celebrated its 20th anniversary. We are given information about John and Jim. John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out. John is currently 28 years old.

Step 2: Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out.
Since John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can find Jim's age by subtracting 20 years from John's age at that time.

Step 3: Calculate Jim's age when Digimon came out.
John was 28 in 2021. We subtract 20 years from this age to find out how old John was when Digimon came out.
John's age when Digimon came out = John's age in 2021 - 20
John's age when Digimon came out = 28 - 20
John's age when Digimon came out = 8

Step 4: Determine Jim's age based on his age difference with John.
Since John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we know that Jim was half of John's age at that time. so, Jim was (8/2) = 4 years old.

Step 5: Find Jim's current age.
Now we know that Jim was 4 when Digimon came out, and he is currently 28. We find Jim's age by subtracting the age difference between Jim and John at the time of Digimon's anniversary from John's current age (28).

Jim's current age = John's current age - (John's age when Digimon came out - Jim's age when Digimon came out)
Jim's current age = 28 - (8 - 4)
Jim's current age = 28 - 2
Jim's current age = 26

{The final answer is: Jim is 26 years old.}</s>","When Digimon came out John would have been 28-20=<<28-20=8>>8

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages from one bulk pack, which contains 50 bandages. So, the number of bulk packs used on the first day is 38 (bandages) / 50 (bandages per pack) = 0.76 >> Since we cannot use a fraction of a pack, we'll say they used 1 pack and had 12 bandages left.

2. They ordered one bulk pack with 50 bandages on the first day. So, they had 1 pack * 50 bandages = 50 bandages at the end of the first day.

3. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than on the first day (38 bandages -> 28 bandages). So, they had 50 (from the first day) + 28 = 78 bandages at the end of the second day.

4. On the third day, they used half a pack and ordered 2 full packs. Half a pack has 25 bandages, so they used 25 bandages on the third day. They ordered 2 packs * 50 bandages = 100 bandages. So, they had 78 (from the second day) + 100 (from the third day) = 178 bandages at the end of the third day.

5. To find out how many bandages they started with on the first day, we need to subtract the bandages they had at the end of the first day from the total number of bandages they had at the end of the third day. So, the total number of bandages they had is 50 (from the first day) + 100 (from the third day) = 150 bandages. Since they used 38 bandages on the first day and had 12 bandages left, they must have started the first day with 150 - 38 - 12 = 100 bandages.

{The final answer is: They started with 100 bandages on the first day.}</s>","Let B be the number of bandages the nurses’ station started with.

Thus, at the end of the second day, they had B + 12 - 28 = B - 16 bandages left.
On the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used half a pack, so they used 50 / 2 = 25.
Thus, on the third day, they had B - 16 + 100 - 25 = B + 59 bandages left.
At the end of the third day, they had 78 = B + 59 bandages left.

                 [/INST] First, let's calculate how much money Jason earned during the two-week period for doing each task:

1. Doing his laundry: $3.00 per time
   - He did it once, so he earned $3.00

2. Cleaning his room: $1.50 per time
   - He did it once, so he earned $1.50

3. Taking out the trash: $0.75 per time
   - He did it twice, so he earned $1.50 (2 * $0.75)

4. Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time
   - He did it 6 times, so he earned $3.00 (6 * $0.50)

Now, we add up all the amounts to find the total earning for the two-week period:

Total earnings = $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (room cleaning) + $1.50 (trash) + $3.00 (dishwasher)
Total earnings = $8.00

{The final answer is $8.00}.</s>","Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times at $0.50 each so he made 6*.50=$<<6*.50=3.00>>3.00
Jason did his laundry 1 time at $3.00 so he made 1*3 = $<<1*3=3.00>>3.00
Jason took the trash out 2 times at $0.75 each so he made 2*.75 = $<<2*.75=1.50>>1.50
Jason cleaned his room 1 time at $1.50 each so he made 1*1.50 = $<<1*1.50=1.50>>1.50
Jason made 3+1.50+1.50+3 = $<<3+1.5+1.5+3=9.00>>9.00

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem
Alain's mom bought a number of red pen packs, each with 5 pens, and a greater number of black pens.

Step 2: Identify the variables
- Number of red pen packs
- Number of black pens

Step 3: Find the number of red pens
Each pack contains 5 red pens, so the number of red pens is:
Number of red pens = Number of red pen packs * Pens per pack

Step 4: Find the number of black pens
The problem states that ""the amount of black pens is twice the amount of red pens,"" so the number of black pens is:
Number of black pens = 2 * Number of red pens

Step 5: Calculate the total number of pens
To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens to the number of black pens:
Total number of pens = Number of red pens + Number of black pens

Step 6: Solve for the number of red pen packs
To find the number of red pen packs, we solve for the variable we haven't yet calculated. Using the relationship between the number of red pen packs and red pens, we have:
Number of red pen packs = Number of red pens / Pens per pack
Number of red pen packs = (Total number of red pens) / 5

Step 7: Calculate the number of red pen packs
First, let's calculate the number of red pens:
Number of red pens = Number of red pen packs * Pens per pack
Substitute the expression for Number of red pens from Step 5 back into the equation:
Number of red pen packs = (Total number of red pens) / 5
Square both sides of the equation to get:
Number of red pen packs^2 = (2 * Total number of red pens) / 5
Multiply both sides by 5 to remove the denominator:
5 * Number of red pen packs^2 = 2 * Total number of red pens
Divide both sides by 2 to isolate Total number of red pens:
Total number of red pens = 5 * Number of red pen packs^2 / 2

Now substitute Total number of red pens back into the equation for Total number of pens:
Total number of pens = Number of red pens + Number of black pens
Total number of pens = (5 * Number of red pen packs^2 / 2) + (2 * 5 * Number of red pen packs)
Total number of pens = 5 * Number of red pen packs (Pens per pack)*(Number of red pen packs + 2)

To find the actual number of red pen packs, we'll need to solve this equation numerically. Once we have the number of red pen packs, we can find the number of pens Alain has using the calculation in Step 3.

The final answer is: [The final answer depends on solving the equation for Number of red pen packs.]</s>","Alain has a total of 5 x 5= <<5*5=25>>25 red pens.
And he has a total of 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 packs of black pens.
So, the total number of black pens he has is 10 x 5 = <<10*5=50>>50.
Therefore, the total number of pens he has is 50 + 25= <<50+25=75>>75.

                 [/INST] To find the total amount John spends on scotch and cognac, we first need to find out how many bottles of cognac he buys and their individual cost.

Given information:
1. John buys 10 bottles of scotch.
2. The total cost of scotch is $600.
3. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac.
4. The cost of a cognac bottle is 50% more than the cost of a scotch bottle.

Step 1: Find the cost of a scotch bottle.
Let the cost of a scotch bottle be x.

The total cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600, so:
10 * x = $600
x = $60

Step 2: Find out the cost of a cognac bottle.
Since the cost of a cognac bottle is 50% more expensive than a scotch bottle, the cost of a cognac bottle is 1.5 * x = $90.

Step 3: Find out how many bottles of cognac John buys.
He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch, so:
Number of cognac bottles = 2 * (Number of scotch bottles) = 2 * 10 = 20 bottles.

Step 4: Find the total cost of cognac.
The cost of 20 bottles of cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

Step 5: Find the total amount John spends on scotch and cognac.
The total cost of scotch is $600, and the total cost of cognac is $1800. So, the total amount John spends on everything is:
$600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.

{The final answer is: $2400}</s>","The scotch cost $600/10=$<<600/10=60>>60 each

White Oak trees planted on the first day = 20
Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day = 20 (since there are twice as many as White Oak) = 40

Step 2: Find the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day.
White Oak trees planted on the second day = 10 more than on the first day = 20 + 10 = 30
Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day = 1/4 more than on the first day = 40 * 1/2 = 20

First, let's make sure we understand what the problem is asking. According to the problem:

1. The number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is ""four times the number"" of something.
2. Eight more than this product is equal to 40.

So, we're looking for the missing number (let's call it 'x') such that 4x + 8 = 40.

Step 2: Solve the equation
To find the number of coffee mugs, follow these steps:
1. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 32.
2. Divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 8.

So, x = 8. This means that the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 'four times the number' of 8.

Step 3: Calculate the number of coffee mugs
Let y = the number of coffee mugs for one instance of 'four times'.
We know that 4y = 8. To find y, divide both sides by 4:
y = 2.

The number of coffee mugs for one instance of 'four times' is 2. So, 'four times the number' of coffee mugs is 4y = 4 * 2 = 8 coffee mugs.

Therefore, the teacher's lounge has 8 * 4 = 32 coffee mugs.

Next, let's find out how many fish have blue stripes. We know that 5/11 of the remaining fish (i.e., the fish without red stripes) have blue stripes. So,

Total number of fish without red stripes = Total number of fish - Number of fish with red stripes
= 66 - 22
= 44 fish

Number of fish with blue stripes = Total number of fish without red stripes * (5/11)
= 44 * (5/11)

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Mattison is 60 inches tall.

Step 2: The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so the total height of the house is 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches.

Step 3: The height of the floor on the first story is three times as high as Mattison, so it is 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches.

Step 4: Since there are two stories in the house, the height of one story must be the difference between the total height of the house and the height of the floor on the first story. So, the height of one story is 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.

Step 5: The roof is above the second story, so we need to add the height of the first story and the height of Mattison to find the height of the second story. The height of the second story is 180 inches (height of the first story floor) + 60 inches (Mattison's height) = 240 inches.

Step 6: Finally, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we add the height of the second story (which we already found) to the height of Mattison: 240 inches (height of the second story) + 60 inches (Mattison's height) = 300 inches.

{The final answer is 300 inches.}</s>","Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.
Hence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.

                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many shells were found by both teams Alphas and The Finders. we know that Team Alphas found 40% of the total shells and Team The Finders found 60% of the remaining shells.

Let's denote the total number of shells as S. The number of shells found by Team Alphas is 0.4S, and the number of shells found by Team The Finders is 0.6 \* (S - 0.4S) = 0.6S - 0.4S = 0.2S

Since we know that the total number of shells found by both teams is equal to the number of shells discovered by all tourists, which is 700, we can write the equation:

0.4S + 0.2S = 700

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

0.6S = 700

Solving for S, we get:

S = 1166.67 shells (approximately)

Now, we need to find out how many shells Team Gogetters found. We know that there were three teams and Team Alphas found 40% of the shells, and Team The Finders found 60% of the remaining shells, so we can assume that Team Gogetters found the remaining 40% of the shells.

Number of shells found by Team Gogetters = 0.4S = 0.4 \* 1166.67 \approx 467 \* 4 = 1870.7 approx. (rounded to the nearest 10 shells)

Team The Finders found 60% of the remaining shells, a total of 60/100*420 = <<60/100*420=252>>252 shells.
If The finders found 252 shells, team Gogetters found 420-252 = 168 shells.

3. The second dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.
4. The third dog needs to walk 3 miles per day.
5. On average, they all need to walk 3 miles per day.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk per day, we first need to find the total miles all four dogs need to walk per day:

6. Total miles for all dogs = Miles for dog 1 + Miles for dog 2 + Miles for dog 3 + Miles for dog 4
7. Total miles = 1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles + ? miles

Now we want to find the miles needed for the last dog so that the total miles match the average of 12 miles per day (3 miles * 4 dogs):

Let's denote the price she bought the magazines for as x. Then the price she sells them for is 11/8 * x.

Profit is equal to the difference between the selling price and the buying price:
Profit = Selling Price - Buying Price

We are given that the buying price is $72. So, we just need to find the selling price and then subtract x (buy price) from it.

Let's calculate the selling price:
Selling Price = Buying Price * (1 + Profit Margin)

In this problem, the profit margin is 11/8 or 1.375 (by multiplying 1 and 11/8)

So, selling price = $72 * 1.375 = $98.10

                 [/INST] To find the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the total amount he owes to his sister, including the interest. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister.
2. He promised to return the original amount and an additional 2% of the money he owed.
3. For 11 months, Stephen paid his sister $25 per month towards the loan.
4. The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid on the twelfth month.

First, let's calculate the interest Stephen owes:

Interest = Principal * 2%
Interest = $300 * 0.02
Interest = $6

So, Stephen owes his sister an additional $6 in interest.

Next, we know that for 11 months, Stephen paid $25 per month towards the loan. We can find the amount he has paid so far by multiplying the monthly payment by the number of months:

Amount_paid = Monthly_payment * Number_of_months
Amount_paid = $25 * 11
Amount_paid = $275

Now we can find the total amount Stephen owes by adding the original loan amount, the interest, and the amount he has already paid:

Total_amount = Principal + Interest + Amount_paid
Total_amount = $300 + $6 + $275
Total_amount = $681

{The final answer is: Stephen will pay $681 in the twelfth month.}</s>","Stephen will pay an additional $300 x 2/100 = $<<300*2/100=6>>6.
He should return a total of $300 + $6 = $<<300+6=306>>306.
For eleven months Stephen will pay a total of $25 x 11 = $<<25*11=275>>275.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many diapers are required for each child per day.
Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.

Step 2: Calculate the number of diapers required for both children in a day.
Number of diapers for both children = Number of diapers required per child * Number of children
Number of diapers for both children = 5 diaper changes/day * 2 children = 10 diapers/day

Step 3: Find out how many diapers Jordan changes in a day.
Jordan changes half of the diapers, so we need to calculate the number of diapers he changes and give him the final answer.

Number of diapers Jordan changes per day = Total number of diapers required in a day * Percentage of diapers changed by Jordan

Since Jordan changes half of the diapers, his share is 50% and the other half is changed by his wife:

Number of diapers Jordan changes per day = 10 diapers/day * 0.5 = 5 diapers/day

The final answer is: Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.</s>","Jordan has 2 children, each requiring 5 diaper changes per day, for a total of 5*2=<<2*5=10>>10 diaper changes per day.

How : far off was his guess?
                 [/INST] To find out how far off Tim was in his guess of the number of red jelly beans in the jar, we first need to find the actual number of jelly beans in the jar and then compare it to Tim's guess.

1. Find the volume of the jar:
The jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches each, so the area of the base is 6 inches × 6 inches = 36 square inches. The jar is 15 inches tall, so the volume of the jar is 36 square inches × 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.
2. Find the number of jelly beans in the jar:
Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches, and the total efficiency in packing is 80%. So the actual number of jelly beans in the jar is 540 cubic inches ÷ 0.8 = 675 cubic inches ÷ 0.15 = 4500 jelly beans.
3. Find the number of red jelly beans in the jar:
30% of the jelly beans are red, so there are 4500 jelly beans × 0.3 = 1350 red jelly beans in the jar.
4. Compare Tim's guess to the actual number:
Tim's guess was {not provided in the question}. To find the difference between his guess and the actual number of red jelly beans, subtract Tim's guess from the actual number: 1350 (actual) − Tim's guess = number of red jelly beans Tim was off by.

Therefore, the final answer is {1350 - Tim's guess = number of red jelly beans Tim was off by}.</s>","The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches

With 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there
So that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bus has a capacity of 200 people.
2. When it departed Chengli city, it had 20 people on board.
3. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus now is 20 + 40 = 60.
4. At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. So, 3/4 * 40 = 30 new passengers entered the bus.
5. Therefore, the total number of passengers on the bus after the second station is 60 + 30 = 90.
6. The problem states that the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station. So, the total number of passengers on the bus after the third station is 90 * 2 = 180.
7. Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces on the bus can be calculated by subtracting the total number of passengers who have entered the bus from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

{The final answer is 20 people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.}</s>","If the number of passengers increased by 3/4 times the number that entered the bus on the first station, 3/4 * 40 people = <<3/4*40=30>>30 people entered the bus on the second station.
After the second station, the number of people on the bus was 20 people initially on the bus + 40 who entered at the first station + 30 who entered at the second station= <<20+40+30=90>>90 people.
The number of people doubled at the third station, which is 90 people * 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 people.
If the bus has a capacity of 200, the number of people required to fill the bus is 200 people - 180 people = <<200-180=20>>20 people

How ? much , did Pauline , spend on all . visits to ; the : museum?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of one visit after 5 years. A 150% increase in cost means the price has doubled, so:
Cost of one visit after 5 years = Cost of one visit * 2
Cost of one visit after 5 years = $2 * 2 = $4

Step 2: Calculate the number of visits Pauline made during the 3 additional years. Since she continues to visit the museum three times a year:
Number of visits in 3 years = 3 * 3 = 9

Step 3: Calculate the cost of all visits during the last 3 years.
Cost of visits in last 3 years = Number of visits * Cost of one visit
Cost of visits in last 3 years = 9 * $4 = $36

Step 4: Calculate the total number of visits Pauline made in the 8 year period.
Total number of visits = Visits in first 5 years + Visits in last 3 years
Total number of visits = 3 years * 3 visits/year + 3 years * 3 visits/year = 18 visits

Step 5: Calculate the cost of all visits in the first 5 years. Since the cost remained the same, this is a simple multiplication:
Cost of visits in first 5 years = Number of visits * Cost of one visit
Cost of visits in first 5 years = 18 visits * $2/visit = $36

Step 6: Calculate the total cost of all visits.
Total cost of all visits = Cost of visits in first 5 years + Cost of visits in last 3 years
Total cost of all visits = $36 + $36 = $72

{The final answer is: Pauline spent a total of $72 on all visits to the museum.}</s>","Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.
That means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.
After 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.
That means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.
So for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
During the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
In total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.

                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many students there are in total at Cedar Falls Middle School, from grades 4 through 7. Since there are 4 grades and each grade has a certain number of students, we can calculate the total number of students by multiplying the number of students per grade by the number of grades:

Total students = Students per grade * Number of grades
Total students = 10 students/grade * 4 grades
Total students = 40 students

Now, we want to find out how many Accelerated Reader points every student aims to earn per year, and we want to know how many students get to try the escape room for every 10 students with the most points. We see that 10 students with the most points are chosen to try the escape room. However, the text states that ""only 8 students can try the escape room at a time"". Since 2 more students are being chosen than can actually participate, it seems there might be an error or inconsistency in the problem statement. We'll assume, for simplicity, that only 8 students try the escape room at a time.

To find the total number of students that try the escape room per year, we can multiply the number of students that try each time (8) by the number of times they can try (number of groups), which would be calculated by dividing the total number of students by the number of students per group (10):

Total students trying escape room per year = Students per try * Number of tries per year
Total students trying escape room per year = 8 students/try * (Total students / Students per group)

However, the problem says that every group uses their full 45 minutes to try and escape. We do not have enough information to calculate how many groups can be accommodated in 45 minutes, which would give us the total number of students that can try the escape room per year. Therefore, we cannot answer the final question.

To summarize, the total number of students is 40, with 8 students trying the escape room per group and 45 minutes given for every attempt. However, we cannot calculate how many tries per year are possible with the given information. {The final answer is undetermined}.</s>","There are 4 grades in the middle school x 10 students = <<4*10=40>>40 students who get to try the escape room.
There will be 40 students / 8 students in a group = <<40/8=5>>5 groups who get to try the escape room.
It will take 5 groups x 45 minutes = <<5*45=225>>225 minutes.

In this problem, we want to find the total amount Ali has to pay John.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of each item.
1. cost of each wooden table = $20
2. cost of each roof frame = $10

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of tables.
total cost of tables = number of tables * cost of each table
total cost of tables = 4 * $20
total cost of tables = $80

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of roof frames.
total cost of roof frames = number of roof frames * cost of each roof frame
total cost of roof frames = 2 * $10
total cost of roof frames = $20

Step 5: Find the total amount Ali has to pay to John.
total amount paid by Ali to John = cost of tables + cost of roof frames

Step 2: Figure out the relationship between the longer and shorter pieces. Let x be the length of the shorter piece. Then, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

Step 3: Use the given information to create an equation. The sum of the lengths of the two pieces equals the original length of the board: x + 4x = 40.

Step 4: Simplify the equation by combining like terms. 5x = 40.

Step 5: Solve the equation to find the length of the shorter piece. x = 8. So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long.

Step 6: Use the relationship between the longer and shorter pieces to find the length of the longer piece. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so its length is 4 × 8 = 32 feet.

{The final answer is the longer piece is 32 feet long.}</s>","Let x be the length of the shorter piece.
The two pieces are 4x and x in length.
The equation is 4x + x = 40 when the lengths of the two boards are added.

Then dividing 40 by 5 gives the value of x which is <<40/5=8>>8.
Since x =8, the longer piece is 4*8 = 32.

Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, the total width of all windows is:
Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35 inches
Total width = 175 inches

Step 2: Determine the amount of fabric Luke needs to buy for each window.
We're told that Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So the amount of fabric needed for each window is:
Fabric for one window = 2 * Width of one window
Fabric for one window = 2 * 35 inches
Fabric for one window = 70 inches

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of fabric Luke needs to buy.
To find out how much fabric Luke needs to buy in total, we multiply the amount of fabric needed for each window by the number of windows:
Total fabric = Number of windows * Fabric for one window
Total fabric = 5 * 70 inches
Total fabric = 350 inches

Cost of the first 16 minutes = 16 * $0.25
Cost of the first 16 minutes = $4

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the remaining minutes at the reduced rate.
Number of remaining minutes = Total minutes of call - Minutes in the first block (16)
Number of remaining minutes = 36 - 16 = 20
Cost of the remaining minutes = Number of remaining minutes * Reduced rate per minute
Cost of the remaining minutes = 20 * $0.2
Cost of the remaining minutes = $4

Step 3: Sum the cost of the first block and the cost of the remaining minutes to find the total cost of the call.
Total cost of the call = Cost of the first block + Cost of the remaining minutes
Total cost of the call = $4 + $4
Total cost of the call = $8

We are given that it rained 2 inches on Monday, and we are told that an additional inch of rain is expected on Tuesday, which is more than half of Monday's total.

Step 2: Interpret the problem.
A. We know that 2 inches of rain fell on Monday.
B. We are told that an additional inch is expected to rain on Tuesday.
C. We are also given that this additional amount is more than half of Monday's total.

Step 3: Solve the problem.
A. Since 1 inch is less than the half of Monday's total of 2 inches, the total amount of rain expected on Tuesday is:

Total rainfall on Tuesday = Rainfall on Monday + Additional rainfall
Total rainfall on Tuesday = 2 inches + 1 inch

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. We know that Carly makes x cupcakes and y brownies for her art class.
2. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be written as: y = 2 < 3x
3. Each person in her class gets two treats, so the total number of treats needed is 5 (number of people) x 2 (treats per person) = 10 treats.
4. Since there are cupcakes and brownies, the total number of treats is x (cupcakes) + y (brownies) = 10
5. We are asked to find the number of cupcakes x that Carly made.
6. First, we need to find the number of brownies y. Since y = 2 < 3x, we can write the equation as y = 2x.
7. Now, we know that x cupcakes + y brownies = 10 treats. Substitute y = 2x into the equation, we have x + 2x = 10
8. Solve for x, we have 3x = 10, x = 10/3
9. However, x must be a whole number since it represents the number of cupcakes Carly made. Therefore, the given information is inconsistent and there is no integer solution for the problem as stated. {The final answer is: This problem has no integer solution.}</s>","First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats
Next, express the number of brownies in terms of the number of cupcakes based on the problem information: b = 3c - 2, where b is the number of brownies and c is the number of cupcakes
We know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10
Now we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10
We add two to both sides of the equation to get 4c = 12
Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to get c = 3

- Pedicure: $40

Step 2: Calculate the discounted price of manicure and pedicure when bought together.
- Discount: 20% off

- Susan receives 12 issues a year from each of the 3 magazines she orders. So, she receives 12 * 3 = <36> issues from these magazines every year.
- She also receives 6 issues a year from one magazine.

Step 2: Next, we need to find out how many issues she receives from the fourth magazine in a year. According to the problem, she receives 4 times the amount of issues that she receives from the 6-issue magazine in a year. Since she receives 6 issues from the fifth magazine annually, she receives 6 * 4 = <24> issues from the fifth magazine in a year.

Step 3: Therefore, the total number of issues Susan receives every year is the sum of the issues she receives from all of her magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = <66> issues.

Since Susan receives a specific number of issues from each magazine throughout the year, it can be concluded that she must have at least 5 magazines, as we have identified 5 different sources of magazines providing her a total of 66 issues in a year. {The final answer is: Susan receives issues from at least 5 magazines every year.}</s>","She has 3 magazines that send 12 issues so that’s 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 issues

                 [/INST] Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So if Shelley has x paintings, then Samantha has (x - 12) paintings.
2. We also know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So if Shelley has x paintings, then Kim has (x - 8) paintings.
3. We're given that Samantha has 27 paintings. So we can set up the equation: x - 12 = 27
4. To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation. First, we add 12 to both sides: x = 39
5. Since x represents the number of Shelley's paintings, we now know that Shelley has 39 paintings.
6. We also know that Kim has (x - 8) paintings. So, Kim has (39 - 8) = 31 paintings

Price in November = $40
Percentage increase in December = 80%

Price increase = Price in November * Percentage increase
Price increase = $40 * 0.8
Price increase = $32
Price in December = $40 + $32
Price in December = $72

Step 2: Next, let's calculate the price decrease in January.
Percentage decrease in January = 50%

Price decrease = Price in December * Percentage decrease
Price decrease = $72 * 0.5
Price decrease = $36

Step 3: Finally, let's calculate the final price of the toy after being discounted in January.

Final price = Price in December - Price decrease
Final price = $72 - $36
Final price = $36

The final answer is: The price of the toy after it was discounted in January was $36.</s>","In November, the toy's price was $<<40=40>>40.

First, let's find the earnings from the standard lessons:
1 lesson = $80
4 lessons = $80 * 4 = $320

Next, let's find the earnings from the veteran lessons, where the rate is reduced by 25%:
1 hour lesson (standard rate) = $80
1 hour lesson (veteran rate) = $80 * 0.75 (reducing 25% or 0.25) = $60
2 lessons = $60 * 2 = $120

Now, we can find the total amount of money Charlie will make in one day by adding the earnings from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons:
$320 (standard lessons) + $120 (veteran lessons) = $440

{The final answer is: $440}</s>","4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate cost 4*$80=$<<4*80=320>>320.

4. So, the number of apples Walter sold to his uncle was: 60 - 48 - 15 = <|im_sep|>17<|/im_sep> apples.
5. He sold these apples to his uncle at a price of $3 per apple, so the total amount Walter received was: 17 * $3 = <|im_sep|>$51<|/im_sep>.

Step 1: Understand the information given
Regina wrote 9 novels last year.

Step 2: Calculate the number of novels Regina has written last year
9 novels

Step 3: Determine the number of novels Regina wrote this year based on the given information
Regina wrote 3 quarters of the number of novels last year, so:

Numbers of novels written last year = 9
Quarters of last year's novels Regina wrote this year = 3/4

To find how many novels she wrote this year, we can set up the following equation:

Novels written this year = (Quarters of last year's novels written) * (Total number of novels written last year)
Novels written this year = (3/4) * 9

Step 4: Solve the equation to find the number of novels Regina has written this year

To solve the equation, we can first find the value of 3/4 * 9, which would be 6.75. Since Regina can't write a fraction of a novel, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number. 

Novels written this year = ⌊6.75⌋ = 6 novels

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/h.

distance = speed * time
time = distance / speed

time (in hours) = 6000 km / 50 km/h = 120 hours
time (in days) = 120 hours / 24 hours/day = 5 days

Michael travels an extra day more than what was initially given in the problem, so we need to adjust his final distance.

Step 2: Find the actual distance covered by Michael after accounting for the 5-day trip.

distance_covered = speed * time
distance_covered = 50 km/h * 5 days = 250 km/h * 5 days = 1250 km

Step 3: Subtract the initial distance (Alaska to Texas) from the total distance traveled.

total_distance = 1250 km + 6000 km = 7250 km

Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the whole distance covered.

percentage = (distance_covered / total_distance) * 100%
percentage = (1250 km / 7250 km) * 100%
percentage = 0.1722 * 100% ≈ 17.22%

{The final answer is approximately 17.22%}

Note: Since the final percentage should be reported as a whole number and not a percentage with decimals, we can say that Michael covered approximately 17% of the total distance between Alaska and Texas.</s>","There are 24 hours in each day, so he has been traveling for a total of 3*24 = <<24*3=72>>72 hours

                 [/INST] To find the number of teachers who were at Rydell Elementary School that day, we need to find the number of sick teachers and add it to the number of substitute teachers.

Step 1: Find the number of sick teachers.
The problem states that 13 of 82 teachers were sick last Friday. We can calculate this by finding 13% of 82.

13% of 82 = (13/100) x 82 = 10.52 ≈ 11 teachers
Since there cannot be a fraction of a teacher, we round up to 12 teachers being sick.

Step 2: Find the number of teachers present including the substitutes.
The number of sick teachers is given as 12, and the number of substitute teachers is given as 9. So, the number of teachers present is:

Teachers present = Sick teachers + Substitute teachers
Teachers present = 12 + 9 = 21

{The final answer is: 21 teachers were at Rydell Elementary School that day.}</s>","There were 82 – 13 = <<82-13=69>>69 regular teachers at school.
If we add the substitute teachers, we find there were 69 + 9 = <<69+9=78>>78 teachers at school that day.

$1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (ceddar cheese) + $3.00 (gruyere cheese)*2 = $7.00

Step 2: Find the cost of macaroni and cheese per year.
Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week. Therefore, the cost of macaroni and cheese per year is:
$7.00 (per week) * 52 (weeks in a year) = $364.00

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many books can be stored on each shelf on a bookcase. The middle shelves can hold 10 books each, and the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. So, the bottom shelf can hold 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 books. Therefore, each bookcase can hold (10 + 20) = <<10+20=30>>30 books.

Next, let's determine how many bookcases Elly needs to store all her 110 books. We divide the total number of books by the number of books that can be stored on one bookcase: <<110/30=3.66666667>>3.67 bookcases. Since we cannot have a decimal number of bookcases, Elly will need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, Elly needs to buy 4 bookcases to hold all her 110 books. {The final answer is 4}.</s>","The bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.

                    , Rose ? bought ; five : dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen. . She : will , sell it for $1 for 3 ? eggs. How ? much : will be , Rose's . profit?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rose bought eggs at $2.40 a dozen. Now, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs she bought.

2. The problem mentions ""five"" and ""dozens"" but it's unclear whether those numbers refer to the number of eggs or the number of dozens. To clarify, we need to use given information to determine how many dozens of eggs Rose bought. Since $2.40 is the price for one dozen eggs, we can calculate how many dozens Rose bought by dividing the total price she paid by the price per dozen:

Dozens bought = Total price / Price per dozen
= $X / $2.40
= X / 2.4
= X * (1 / 2.4)

We don't have a value for X, the total price, so we can't calculate the exact number of dozens right now. But we'll come back to this calculation eventually.

3. Next, the problem mentions that Rose will sell eggs for $1 a dozen. We'll use this information to calculate her profit per dozen.

4. Profit per dozen = Selling price - Buying price
= $1 - $2.40
= -$1.40

But this number doesn't make sense as a profit, because it's a negative number. This means that Rose is losing $1.40 per dozen when she sells at $1, which is not profitable. Instead, we need to find a selling price at which she makes a profit. Let's denote the number of dozens she sells as Y and her profit per dozen as P.

Profit per dozen = Selling price - Buying price
P = $Y - $2.40

To make a profit, P should be a positive number. This means that Y should be bigger than 2.4 times the number of dozens Rose bought.

5. Now, we have two equations to solve:

Dozens bought = X / 2.4
Profit per dozen = Y - 2.4

We don't have enough information to calculate X or Y directly, but we can express the profit per dozen in terms of the buying price and the number of dozens Rose sells:

Profit per dozen = Selling price - Buying price
P = Y * ($1 - $2.40)

We want P to be positive. Thus, Y should be bigger than 2.4 times the number of dozens Rose bought. We can rewrite this condition as:

Y > 2.4 * (X / 2.4)
Y > X

Since the number of dozens Rose sells must be larger than the number she bought, this condition implies that she cannot make a profit by selling at $1 a dozen (Y = 3).

6. At this point, we haven't been able to find a solution for the problem as stated. Since Rose cannot make a profit by selling at $1 a dozen, the final answer is:

{The final answer is: It is not possible for Rose to make a profit by selling eggs at $1 a dozen.}

Throughout this process, we discovered that the problem statement was incorrect and led us to an impossible situation. By analyzing the information and applying mathematical reasoning, we were able to identify this inconsistency.</s>","Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.
Five dozens of eggs is equal to 12 x 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 eggs.
So there are 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 sets of 3 eggs that Rose will sell.
Thus, the total earnings of Rose for selling the eggs are $1 x 20 = $<<20=20>>20.
Therefore, her profit will be $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8.

1. Skyler has 100 hats in total.
2. Half of the hats are red, so we find the number of red hats by calculating 50% of 100.
   Red hats = Total hats * 0.5 = 100 * 0.5 = 50

3. Next, we know that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. Let's denote the total number of hats after subtracting the red hats as X.

4. We have: X = 100 - 50 = 50
5. So, 3/5 of X or 3X/5 = number of blue hats.

6. To find the number of blue hats, we calculate: Blue hats = 3X/5 = 3 * (50) / 5 = 30

7. Finally, to find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats:
   White hats = Total hats - Red hats - Blue hats = 100 - 50 - 30 = 20

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, a total of 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30 hats

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the price of each stick of beef jerky.
The price of one bag is $18.00, and there are 30 sticks in one bag. So, the price of one stick is:
$18.00 ÷ 30 = $0.6 × 100 = $6.00/bag → $0.2 × 100 = $2.00/stick

Step 2: Find the discounted price of one bag.
The discount is $3.00 off the price of one bag, so the discounted price is:
$2.00/stick × 30 sticks/bag - $3.00

Step 3: Solve for the number of sticks at the discounted price.
Subtract the discount from the total number of sticks in one bag:
30 sticks/bag - 3 sticks = 27 sticks

Step 4: Find the price of these 27 sticks.
$2.00/stick × 27 sticks = $54.00

Step 5: Divide the total cost by the number of sticks to find the cost of one stick.
$54.00 ÷ 27 sticks = $2.00 ≈ $2.00/stick (rounded to the nearest cent)

The final answer is: Each stick of jerky costs approximately $2.00 at the discount. [Alternative calculation:] Since the discount is $3.00 off the price of one bag, and each stick costs $2.00, the discount can also be calculated as: $3.00 savings/bag ÷ 30 sticks/bag = $0.1 × 100 = $1.00/stick. So, the cost of each stick when the bag is discounted is $1.00 + $2.00/stick = $3.00/bag ÷ 30 sticks/bag ≈ $0.1 × 100 = $1.00/stick. Thus, the final answer is the same: Each stick costs approximately $2.00 at the discount.</s>","The bags are $18.00 with a $3.00 coupon so each bag is 18-3 = $<<18-3=15.00>>15.00

We're given that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So we have the equation to solve:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. First, let's get x by itself on one side of the equation.
x = 112 - 5x

2. To isolate x, we'll need to get the x term on the left side of the equation. So, let's subtract 112 from both sides:
-5x = -112

3. Next, let's divide both sides by -5 to get the value of x:
x = 22.4

However, since we cannot have a fraction of an ice cube, there is an inconsistency in the problem. In this case, it's important to notice that the given information is not valid since it leads to an impossible situation. {The final answer is undefined}.

Instead, let's find the number of blueberry cubes by using the value of x found above:

Blueberry cubes = 5x - 4

≈ 113.8

Once again, we cannot have a fraction of an ice cube. So, the inconsistency in the problem leads to an undefined answer.</s>","Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.

Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116
Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120
Dividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20
Substituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96

                 [/INST] Step 1: We start with the fact that Brendan had 10 marbles in his bag. He dropped half of them while tripping over a pebble.

Step 2: Half of 10 is 5, so Brendan dropped 5 marbles.

Step 3: After searching for the dropped marbles, he only found 3 of them. So, he still has 7 marbles (10 original marbles - 3 found).

Step 4: One of the marbles he inspected was not a marble but a bead. He got rid of it, so the number of marbles Brendan has now is one less than the number he had after finding the 3 dropped marbles (7 marbles - 1 bead).

The final answer is: Brendan ended up with 6 marbles.</s>","Brendan dropped his marbles and was left with 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 marbles.
He searched and found some of his lost marbles, getting him back to 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 marbles.

                 [/INST] To find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make in order to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus, we need to break down this problem into smaller steps:

Step 1: Find out how many potential customers Jason needs to bring into the dealership to sell 15 cars.

Given that for every two customers, one will buy a car, we need to find out how many customers are required to sell 15 cars.

15 cars sold = 15 cars bought

Therefore, we need 15 customers to buy 15 cars. Thus, the number of customers required is 15.

Step 2: Find out how many customers Jason needs to bring into the dealership for every telephone call he makes.

Given that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets one person to come into the dealership to look at new cars, we need to find out how many customers (or potential customers) he brings in per telephone call.

1 person comes for every 25 telephone calls

Therefore, 1 customer comes per
25 × 1 = 25 telephone calls

Step 3: Calculate the number of telephone calls required to bring in 15 customers.

15 customers required = 15 customers brought in

So we need to calculate how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to bring in 15 customers:

15 customers brought in = 15 customers required
25 telephone calls for 1 customer =Constant

We can set this up as an equation:

15 = n × 25

To find n, divide both sides of the equation by 25:

n = 15 / 25
n ≈ 0.6

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a telephone call, we round up to the nearest whole number, which results in the need for an extra call to ensure bringing in 15 customers.

n + 1 = 1.6 ≈ 2
n = 1

Thus, we need to make 2 attempts (or calls) to bring in 1 customer. So 15 customers will require:

15 customers × 2 attempts/customer = 30 attempts

Step 4: Find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

Given that for every 30 telephone calls, Jason manages to sell 15 cars, we need to calculate how many telephone calls he needs to make to have sold 15 cars by the end of the month and earn his bonus.

15 cars sold every 30 telephone calls = 0.5 car/telephone call

Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars in total to earn his bonus:

15 cars = total cars needed to be sold
x telephone calls = telephone calls needed

Set up the equation: 15 = x/0.5

Multiply both sides by 0.5:

15 = x

Therefore, Jason would need to make 15 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

But we knew in step 3 that 15 x 2 attempts/customer = 30 attempts. Since we know that one call will result in a customer coming to the dealership and potentially purchasing a car, it's clear that Jason will only need to make one call to make the sale.

So, the final answer would be: {The final answer is: Jason needs to make 15 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.} But it's more likely that Jason would need to make 30 telephone calls to ensure that he brings in the 15 customers necessary to make the sales. However, since we found that one call results in a sale, it's clear that Jason just needs to make 15 calls to make the sales and earn the bonus. The initial assumption that Jason needs to make 30 calls to bring in 15 customers was incorrect.

The mistake: The assumption that Jason would need to make 30 calls to bring in 15 customers was an incorrect assumption, since the given information tells us that every call results in one potential customer visiting the dealership, and one out of every two visitors will buy a car. The correct information to use is that Jason should make 15 calls to earn his bonus.</s>","If it takes 2 customers to make one sale, then to get his 15 sales Jason will need 2*15=<<2*15=30>>30 customers to come into the car dealership.
Since Jason needs to make 25 telephone calls to get one person to come into the dealership, to get 30 customers, Jason must make 25*30=<<25*30=750>>750 telephone calls.

1. There are 8 rooms in the house.
2.For half of the rooms (4 rooms), there are 4 small candles each, so there are 4 rooms * 4 small candles = <<4*4=16>>16 small candles in total.
3.For the other half of the rooms (4 rooms), there are 5 medium candles each, so there are 4 rooms * 5 medium candles = <<4*5=20>>20 medium candles in total.
4.There are 4 people living in the house including Brianna, so there are 4 people * 1 flashlight = <<4*1=4>>4 flashlights for the people.
5.There are 2 flashlights for each room, so there are 8 rooms * 2 flashlights = <<8*2=16>>16 flashlights in total for the rooms.
6.The total number of candles used is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = <<16+20=36>>36 candles.
7.The total number of flashlights used is the number of flashlights for the people + the number of flashlights for the rooms = 4 flashlights + 16 flashlights = <<4+16=20>>20 flashlights.

{The final answer is 36 candles and 20 flashlights.}</s>","For every one of the 8 rooms in the house, there are 2 flashlights, 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 flashlights.

Total, there are 16 + 4 = <<16+4=20>>20 flashlights in the house being used by Brianna and her family.
For half of the 8 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, 8/2 x 4 = <<8/2*4=16>>16 small candles in half the rooms.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of chips Mitchell bought.
Mitchell bought chips from two bags. Each bag had 55 pounds of chips, and 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, and 1 ounce is equal to 1 chip (approximation), so we have:
Total chips = 2 * 55 * 16 * 1
Total chips = 2 * 55 * 16 * 1
Total chips = 2 * 55 * 16 * 1
Total chips = 1320 * 16
Total chips = 21120

Step 2: Determine the number of chips each family member gets if they all get the same number.
Total chips for five persons = Total chips / Number of persons
Total chips for five persons = 21120 / 5
Total chips for five persons = 4224

Since we can't deliver a fraction of a chip, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

So, each person gets approximately 4223 chips.
However, to simplify the problem, let's consider each person gets the quotient of the total chips and the number of family members:

Chips per person = Total chips / Number of persons
Chips per person = 21120 / 5
Chips per person = 4224 (approximation)

Step 3: Determine the exact number of chips each person gets when the total chips are divided amongst all family members.
Exact chips per person = Total chips / Number of persons
Exact chips per person = 21120 / 5
Exact chips per person = 4224.4
Exact chips per person = 4224 (rounding down)

Therefore, {each person gets 4224 chips}. However, since this number is not a realistic amount of chips for a single person to consume in one sitting, it's important to remember that the initial approximation of assuming each chip equals one ounce is a simplification. The actual number of chips per person will depend on the actual weight of a single serving of nacho chips and may not be exactly equal to 4223 or 4224.</s>","There are 110 chips because 2 x 55 = <<2*55=110>>110

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side: 2 * 5 = 10 minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side: 0.5 * 5 = 2.5 minutes.

So, the times for each side are: first - 5 minutes, second and third - 10 minutes, and last two - 2.5 minutes.

To find the total time required, we need to add up the time for each side:

The final answer is: 5 minutes (first side) + 10 minutes (second and third sides) + 2.5 minutes (last two sides) = 17.5 minutes.</s>","The second and third side each take 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes

Step 4: Since half of the distance is on land and half is in water, Phineas will need to hop on land for that half of the distance and swim through water for the other half.

Step 5: We know that Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute and swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute.

Step 6: To find the time it takes Phineas to hop on land, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed
Time for hopping = 200 yards / 20 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Step 7: Similarly, for the time it takes Phineas to swim through water, we can use the same formula:
Time for swimming = 200 yards / 10 yards per minute = 20 minutes

Step 8: Since Phineas needs to do both hopping and swimming, we add the times together to find the total time it takes to return home:
Total time = Time for hopping + Time for swimming = 10 minutes + 20 minutes = 30 minutes

The final answer is: it takes Phineas 30 minutes to return home.</s>","Half of 200 yards is 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 yards.
100 yards at 20 yards per minute is 100/20=<<100/20=5>>5 minutes.
100 yards at 10 yards per minute is 100/10=<<100/10=10>>10 minutes.
In total, it will take Phineas 5+10=<<5+10=15>>15 minutes to return home.

1. First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs to buy. He needs 56 sticks, and each box has 8 sticks. So, we calculate: 56 sticks ÷ 8 sticks per box = 7 boxes

2. Next, we need to find out how much it costs for Bob to buy 7 boxes of popsicles sticks. We know that each box costs $2.00. So, we calculate: Cost for 7 boxes = 7 boxes × $2.00 per box = $14.00

3. Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is $14.00}. Bob will need to spend $14.00 to buy the popsicle sticks for his history project.</s>","He needs 56 popsicle sticks to build his project and they come 8 to a box so he needs 56/8 = <<56/8=7>>7 boxes

                 [/INST] To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the main phone and the cost of each additional phone. Let's call the number of additional phones ""x"".

1. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so the cost of the main phone is 2 * (cost of one additional phone).
2. We're given that the cost of the main phone plan is $20. We can use this information to find the cost of one additional phone.
3. Since the main phone costs 2 * (cost of one additional phone), we have: cost of main phone = 2 * cost of one additional phone.
4. We know that the cost of the main phone plan is $20, so: cost of main phone + (number of additional phones * cost of one additional phone) = $20
5. Substitute cost of main phone with 2 * cost of one additional phone, we get: 2 * cost of one additional phone + (number of additional phones * cost of one additional phone) = $20
6. To find the cost of one additional phone, we can solve for it: cost of one additional phone = $20 / (number of additional phones + 1)
7. Since there are five phones in total, the number of additional phones is 5 - 1 = 4.
8. Substitute the value of number of additional phones into the equation for cost of one additional phone: cost of one additional phone = $20 / (4 + 1) = $20 / 5 = $4
9. Now that we know the cost of one additional phone is $4, we can find the cost of the whole phone plan: cost of whole phone plan = cost of main phone + (number of additional phones * cost of one additional phone) = 2 * $4 + 4 * $4 = $12 + $16 = $<<12+16=28>>28

{The final answer is $28}.</s>","Each additional phone costs 20 / 2 = $<<20/2=10>>10.
Thus, the four additional phones cost 4 * 10 = $<<4*10=40>>40 in all.
Thus, the whole phone plan cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60.

                 [/INST] Step 1: determine how many doughnuts Derrick makes in a day and the price per doughnut.
Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts each day, and there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen. So, Derrick makes 10 * 12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts each day. The price of each doughnut is $2.

Step 2: calculate the daily revenue.
The revenue Derrick earns each day is the number of doughnuts he sells multiplied by the price per doughnut. So, his daily revenue is 120 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $<<120*2=240>>240.

Step 3: determine how many days are in June.
There are 30 days in most years, but June in some years has 30 days and in others has 31 days. To find the exact number of days in June for a specific year, you would need to check a calendar for that year. But, as a general rule, there are typically 30 days in June.

Step 4: calculate the total revenue for June.
To find the total revenue Derrick earns in June, multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in June. So, Derrick's total revenue for June is $240/day * 30 days = $<<240*30=7200>>7200. {The final answer is $7,200.}</s>","A dozen doughnuts have 12 doughnuts, and if Derrick makes 10 dozen in a day, the total number of doughnuts he makes is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts.
Since each doughnut sells at $2 per piece, Derrick makes 120*$2 = $<<120*2=240>>240 per day from selling his doughnuts.
In June, with 30 days, after making and selling the doughnuts every day, Derrick makes $240*30 = $<<30*240=7200>>7200

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate John's new speaking speed.
John's speaking speed has increased 2.5 times his starting speed. Therefore, his new speaking speed is: 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

Step 2: Calculate the number of words John can speak in 1 minute.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of words John can speak in 1 minute by dividing the total number of words per minute by the number of minutes in an hour: 375 WPM / 60 minutes = 6.25 thousand words per hour.

Step 3: Calculate the number of words in 10 pages.
We know that each page contains 450 words. So, the total number of words in 10 pages is: 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words.

Step 4: Determine how long it would take John to speak 4500 words.
We have the number of words John can speak per hour (6.25 thousand words/hour), and we can calculate how long it would take him to speak 4500 words by dividing the total number of words by his speaking rate: 4500 words / 6250 words/hour = 0.726 hours. Since hours, minutes, and seconds have 60 units, we can convert hours to minutes by multiplying 0.726 hours by 60 minutes/hour: 0.726 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 43.6 minutes.

Step 5: The final answer:
It would take John approximately 43 minutes and 36 seconds to speak the content of 10 pages, given that each page has 450 words. {The final answer is: 43 minutes and 36 seconds}</s>","He can speak 150*2.5=<<150*2.5=375>>375 words per minute

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that on the first day of the week, Conor found 50 people at the beach. Let's denote X as the number of people at the beach on the second day.

Step 2: On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day. So the number of people on the second day was X + 20.

Step 3: On the third day, the total number of people at the beach was twice the number of people on the second day. So the number of people on the third day was 2X.

Step 4: Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week. Let N be the number of days for which Conor saw this average number of people. Then the total number of people Conor saw during those N days was 60N.

Step 5: However, we also need to account for the number of people Conor saw on the first three days, which we have already calculated. So the total number of people Conor saw during the entire week was:

50 + (X + 20) + (2X) + 60N

Step 6: To find the value of X, we know that on the third day, 2X was twice the number of people on the second day. So X = 2(X + 20)/2 = X + 20. Solving this equation, we get X = 20.

Step 7: Substituting X = 20 into our expression for the total number of people Conor saw during the week, we get:

50 + (20 + 20) + (2 * 20) + 60N

Simplifying this expression, we get:

50 + 40 + 40 + 60N = 180 + 60N

So the total number of people Conor saw at the beach during the week was 180 + 60N.

The final answer is 180 + 60N.</s>","There were 50 people at the beach on the first day. On the second day, the number of people at the beach increased to 50 people + 20 people = <<50+20=70>>70 people

For the remaining days of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people per day, for a total of 60 people/day * 4 days = <<60*4=240>>240 people

                 [/INST] To answer this question, let's first determine how many popcorn kernels popped in each 30-second interval.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 popcorn kernels popped.
2. In the next 30 seconds, 3 times the amount of the first 30 seconds popped. So, 60 popcorn kernels popped in the second 30 seconds.
3. In the third 30 seconds, 4 times the initial popping rate popped. That means, 80 popcorn kernels popped in the third 30 seconds.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half. So, only 40% of the popping rate in the third 30 seconds popped. That means, 32 popcorn kernels popped in the final 30 seconds.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds continued popping from the residual heat. So, 8 popcorn kernels popped from the residual heat.

Adding up all the popcorn kernels that popped during the cooking process:
- First 30 seconds: 20 kernels
- Second 30 seconds: 60 kernels
- Third 30 seconds: 80 kernels
- Final 30 seconds: 32 + 8 = 40 kernels

However, the question asks ""how many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?"" This final answer would depend on the size of the popcorn pieces. Assuming an average size, each piece of popcorn consists of about 3-4 kernels. Therefore, we can estimate that Garrett has approximately 150-200 pieces of popcorn in total to eat.

{The final answer is: 150-200 pieces}</s>","In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 kernels pop.
In the third 30 seconds, 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 kernels pop.
In the final 30 seconds, 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 40 / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 kernels pop.
Thus, Garrett has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = <<20+60+80+40+10=210>>210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many lemons are needed to produce 1 gallon of lemonade.
For 1 gallon of lemonade, the recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice. We know that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. Therefore, the number of lemons needed to produce 1 gallon of lemonade is:
1 gallon ≡ 160 pints  équivoque 160 × 0.25 gal/pint = 40 gal
1 gallon łemakej  équivoque 128 cup  (1 gal = 128 cup)
1 gallon łemakej  = 128 cups ÷ 1 cup/6 lemons = 21.33 lemons (≈22 lemons)  (since we cannot use a fraction of a lemon)

Step 2: Calculate the number of lemons needed for the original 4 gallons for the party.
4 gallons łemakej  = 4 × 21.33 ≈ 85.32 ≈ 86 lemons

Step 3: Calculate the number of lemons needed for Allen's extra gallon, which is twice as tart as the other gallons.
To make Allen's extra gallon twice as tart, we would need twice as much lemon juice. So, we need twice the number of lemons for that gallon:
2 gallons łemakej  = 2 × 86 ≈ 172 lemons

Step 4: Summarize the answer.
{The final answer is: 22 lemons for the original party, 86 lemons for the party plus an extra gallon, and 172 lemons for the party with an extra gallon twice as tart.}</s>","Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch
In addition, he will make 4 regular gallons of lemonade, which each need 1 cup juice so 4*1 = <<4*1=4>>4 cups total
All total he will need 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of juice
Each cup requires 6 lemons each and he needs 6 cups of juice so 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 lemons needed

                 [/INST] To find the total amount of dog food needed for the Kennel in a week, we first need to calculate the daily food consumption for all German Shepherds and Bulldogs and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

1. Calculate the daily food consumption for German Shepherds:
   There are 3 German Shepherds, and each consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day. So, the daily food consumption for German Shepherds is: 3 (number of German Shepherds) x 5 (kilograms of food per day) = 15 kilograms

2. Calculate the daily food consumption for Bulldogs:
   There are 2 Bulldogs, and each consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day. So, the daily food consumption for Bulldogs is: 2 (number of Bulldogs) x 3 (kilograms of food per day) = 6 kilograms

3. Calculate the total daily dog food consumption:
   The total daily dog food consumption is the sum of the daily food consumption for German Shepherds and Bulldogs. So, Total daily food consumption = 15 (German Shepherds) + 6 (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms

4. Calculate the total weekly dog food consumption:
   There are 7 days in a week. So, the total weekly dog food consumption is: Total weekly food consumption = 21 (daily food consumption) x 7 (days in a week) = 147 kilograms

{The final answer is 147 kilograms}</s>","The German Shepherds consume 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 kilograms of dog food per day.
The Bulldogs consume 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 kilograms of dog food per day.
The dogs can consume a total of 15 + 6 = <<15+6=21>>21 kilograms of dog food per day.
Therefore, they need 21 x 7 = <<21*7=147>>147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so there are 10 animals with a total of 20 legs (10 animals * 2 legs each).
4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so there are 15 animals with a total of 60 legs (15 animals * 4 legs each).

Step 2: Add up the total number of legs on the farm.
The farm has a total of 20 legs (from 2-legged animals) + 60 legs (from 4-legged animals) = 80 legs

We can write this information in an equation:

4 blue + 2 * number of yellow + x = 32

First, let's find the number of yellow blocks. We know that there are 2 times as many yellow blocks as blue blocks. So, we can represent the number of yellow blocks as:

number of yellow = 2 * 4 = 8

Now we can substitute the number of blue blocks and yellow blocks into the equation:

4 + 2 * 8 + x = 32

We can simplify this equation:

4 + 16+x = 32

16+x = 28

x = 28 - 16

x = 12

Therefore, there are 12 red blocks in the tower.

Since Elvis drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph:
Distance_west = Speed * Time
Distance_west = 18 mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Then, Elvis turned around and drove east for 8 hours:
Distance_east = Speed * Time
Distance_east = 18 mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Step 2: Find the total distance Elvis traveled.
Total_distance = Distance_west + Distance_east
Total_distance = 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles

Step 3: Determine Elvis' current position relative to his house.
Since Elvis traveled a total of 234 miles from his house, and if we assume his initial position was at the starting point of his journey (i.e., his house), then his current position is 234 miles away from his house.

{The final answer is: Elvis is currently 234 miles away from his house.}</s>","During the first part of the journey he travels west for 5 hours at a speed of 18mph so he covered a distance of 5*18 = <<5*18=90>>90 miles

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the value of the boat after the first year, given it depreciated 30%.
The initial price of the boat was $9000. Depreciation in the first year was 30%, so:

{Depreciation = Initial Price * Percentage}
{30% depreciation = $9000 * 0.3}

Calculate 30% of $9000:
Depreciation = $2700

Subtract the depreciation from the initial value to find the value after the first year:

{Value after the first year = Initial Price - Depreciation}
{Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700}

Value after the first year = $6300

Step 2: Find the value of the boat after the second year, given it depreciated another 30%.

We know the value after the first year was $6300. Depreciation in the second year was 30%, so:

{Depreciation = Value after the first year * Percentage}
{30% depreciation = $6300 * 0.3}

Calculate 30% of $6300:
Depreciation = $1929

Subtract the depreciation from the value after the first year to find the value after the second year:

{Value after the second year = Value after the first year - Depreciation}
{Value after the second year = $6300 - $1929}

Value after the second year = $4371

Step 3: Find the value of the boat after the third year, given it depreciated 20% in the third year.

We know the value after the second year was $4371. Depreciation in the third year was 20%, so:

{Depreciation = Value after the second year * Percentage}
{20% depreciation = $4371 * 0.2}

Calculate 20% of $4371:
Depreciation = $874.2

Subtract the depreciation from the value after the second year to find the value after the third year:

{Value after the third year = Value after the second year - Depreciation}
{Value after the third year = $4371 - $874.2}

Value after the third year = $3496.8

Step 4: Summary
Gary's boat initially cost $9000. After 3 years, it depreciated as follows:
1. First year: 30%, depreciation: $2700, value after the first year: $6300
2. Second year: 30%, depreciation: $1929, value after the second year: $4371

                 [/INST] To find out how many candies are pink in the bag, we need to find the number of pink candies given the number of red, orange, and yellow candies.

First, let's determine the number of orange candies. We know that there are twice as many orange candies as red candies:

Number of orange candies = 2 * Number of red candies

Number of red candies = 54

So,

Number of orange candies = 2 * 54 = 108

Next, we'll find the number of yellow candies. We know that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies:

Number of yellow candies = 0.5 * Number of red candies

Number of yellow candies = 0.5 * 54 = 27

Now, we know that there are 232 pieces of candy in the bag in total. We can use this information to check our calculations:

Number of red candies + Number of orange candies + Number of yellow candies + Number of pink candies = Total number of candies

54 + 108 + 27 + Number of pink candies = 232

169 + Number of pink candies = 232

Number of pink candies = 232 - 169

Number of pink candies = 63

So, {The final answer is 63 pink candies in the bag.}</s>","There are 54 red candies and twice that amount of orange candies for a total of 54*2 = <<54*2=108>>108 candies
The yellow candies are half the amount of the 54 red candies so there are 54/2 = <<54/2=27>>27 candies
All total there are 54 red candies, 108 orange candies and 27 yellow candies so 54+108+27 = <<54+108+27=189>>189 candies
The bag has 232 candies and the red, orange and yellow candies total 189 pieces so there are 232-189 = <<232-189=43>>43 pink candies

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

Step 1: Calculate the cost of tickets for the adults and children.
Since there are parents (plural), we assume there are at least 2 adults. Let's denote the number of adults as A and the number of children as C.

Cost of adult tickets = A * $12
Cost of child tickets = C * $8

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the tickets.
We know that there are at least 2 adults, so let's assume there are 2 adults in the family. Thus, there must be C = A children.

Cost of adult tickets = 2 * $12 = $24
 Cost of child tickets = A * $8 = A * $8

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the popcorns.
We buy 2 popcorns, and each popcorn costs $3.

Cost of popcorns = 2 * $3 = $6

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the cinema visit.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of popcorns

Total cost = ($24 + A*$8) + $6

Step 5: Find the value of A.
Since there are at least 2 adults, and there are as many children as adults, we have A = C. But we don't know the exact number of children. For the sake of finding an answer, let's assume there are 3 children, so A = 3.

Total cost = ($24 + 3*$8) + $6

Step 6: Find the total cost.
Substituting A = 3 into the equation from Step 4:

Total cost = ($24 + 3*$8) + $6
 Total cost = ($24 + $24) + $6
 Total cost = $48 + $6

Step 7: Conclude.
{The final answer is: they pay $54 in total.}

Perimeter = 2 × ( 20 feet + 15 feet )

Calculate the sum of the length and width:

Perimeter = 2 × ( 20 feet + 15 feet )
          = 2 × ( 35 feet )

Multiply the sum by 2:

Perimeter = 2 × 35 feet

Step 2: We also know that Mia is currently 40 years old.

To find the average of their ages, we first need to find the age of Emma since Mia's age is given and we know that Mia is 16 years younger than Emma.

Step 3: We can set up the equation: Emma's age = Mia's age +16
Step 4: Since Mia is 40, then Emma's age = 40 + 16 = 56

Step 5: To find the average of their ages, we can add their ages together and divide by 2.
Step 6: Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Step 7: Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Step 8: Average age = 96 / 2

The final answer is: {The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is 48 years.}</s>","If Mia is 40 years old, Emma is 40+16 = <<40+16=56>>56 years old.

1. Tom found 214 seashells, and 67 were cracked, so he found 147 good seashells: 214 - 67 = 147.
2. Nancy found 432 seashells, and we don't know how many were cracked, so we need more information to find out how many good seashells she found.
3. Benny found 86 seashells, and 0 were cracked (we'll assume for now that no information was given about cracked seashells for Benny), so he found 86 good seashells.

To find the total number of good seashells they found together, we need to add the good seashells found by each person: 147 (Tom) + 86 (Benny) = 233.

However, we must remind ourselves that we didn't have enough information about Nancy's cracked seashells, so we cannot be certain about the final answer.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of place settings required. Each person will need one dinner plate, one salad plate, and one bowl. So, for 12 people:
- Dinner plates: 12 people * 1 plate/person = 12 dinner plates
- Salad plates: 12 people * 1 plate/person = 12 salad plates
- Bowls: 12 people * 1 bowl/person = 12 bowls

Thus, a total of 12 dinner plates + 12 salad plates + 12 bowls = <<12*1+12*1+12*1=36>>36 place settings are required.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of dinner plates. The cost of one dinner plate is $6.00, so the cost of 36 dinner plates will be 36 dinner plates * $6.00/dinner plate = $<<36*6=216>>216.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of salad plates. The cost of one salad plate is $4.00, so the cost of 12 salad plates will be 12 salad plates * $4.00/salad plate = $<<12*4=48>>48.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of bowls. The cost of one bowl is $5.00, so the cost of 12 bowls will be 12 bowls * $5.00/bowl = $<<12*5=60>>60.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of place settings. The total cost of place settings is the cost of dinner plates + the cost of salad plates + the cost of bowls = $216 + $48 + $60 = $<<216+48+60=324>>324.

1 pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
So, 1 pig eats 4 pounds * 2 = <<1px 4 * 2 = 8px>>8 pounds of feed in a day.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of feed consumed by all five pigs in a day.
5 pigs * 8 pounds/pig = <<1px 8 * 5 = 40px>>40 pounds of feed/day

Step 3: Calculate the amount of feed consumed by all five pigs in a week.
1 week = 7 days
5 pigs * 40 pounds/day * 7 days = <<1px 5 * 40 * 7 = 1680px>>1680 pounds of feed/week

Step 4: Subtract the feed consumed in a week from the total amount of feed ordered.
300 pounds - 1680 pounds = <<1px -1680 + 300 = -1180px>>-1180 pounds

Since a negative answer doesn't make sense in this context, this indicates that there's not enough feed for the pigs for a week.

{The final answer is: There is a shortage of 1180 pounds of feed for the pigs for a week.}</s>","In a day, one pig consumes 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 pounds of feed.

Cost of trays = 5 * $4
Cost of trays = $20

Step 3: Subtract the cost of trays from the total revenue to find how much money Frances has left.

1. We have a family with one father and one mother.
2. There are two brothers in the family.
3. We are given that one brother is 12 years old.
4. We are also given that there are three sisters in the family.
5. All the sisters are the same age, which is 16 years old.
6. We are asked to find the total age of all the siblings.

Let's first calculate the age of the older brother:

1. The older brother has two younger siblings, one brother who is 12 and three sisters who are all 16.
2. Since one brother is half the age of the older brother, we can calculate the older brother's age as follows: Older brother's age = 12 (younger brother's age) × 2 + 12 + 3 × 16
3. Simplifying the equation, we get: Older brother's age = 12 × 2 + 12 + 16 × 3 = 36 + 12 + 48 = 96

Now we can find the total age of all the siblings:

Total age of siblings = Older brother's age + Younger brother's age + Number of sisters × Their age {Since all sisters are the same age}
Total age of siblings = 96 + 12 + 3 × 16 = 96 + 12 + 48 = 156

{The final answer is 156}.</s>","Three sisters are in total 3 * 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 years old.

1. Meditation practice per day: Charisma meditates for 15 minutes when she first wakes up and for 15 minutes before she goes to sleep. So, she meditates for 15 + 15 = <<15+15=30>>30 minutes per day.

2. Meditation practice per week: She meditates for 30 minutes every day, so she spends 30 minutes x 7 days/week = <<30*7=210>>210 minutes per week on meditation.

3. Yoga practice per week: She practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days/week. So, she spends 60 minutes x 5 days/week = <<60*5=300>>300 minutes per week on yoga.

A small sunflower has 3 dozens seeds. In decimal form, 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 3 * 12 * 10 = 36 seeds. {The number of seeds in a small sunflower is 36}.

Step 2: Find the number of seeds in a large sunflower.
A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. So, the number of seeds in a large sunflower is 36 + 0.5 * 36 = 36 + 18 = 54 seeds. {The number of seeds in a large sunflower is 54}.

Step 3: Find the total number of seeds in both sunflowers.
To find the total number of seeds, simply add the number of seeds in the small sunflower to the number of seeds in the large sunflower.

Step 2: The problem states that Jackie is now 2"" shorter than Anne, so we can set up the equation: Anne's height = Jackie's height before summer + 2""

Step 3: We also know that Anne is twice the size of Albert. So, Albert's height is half of Anne's height: Anne's height = 2 * Albert's height

Step 4: Substitute Albert's known height of 36"" into Anne's equation: Anne's height = 2 * 36""

Step 5: Solve for Anne's height: Anne's height = 72""

Step 6: Substitute Anne's calculated height and Jackie's growth of 3"" into the original equation: 72"" = Jackie's height before summer + 2""

Step 7: Solve for Jackie's height before summer: Jackie's height before summer = 70""

{The final answer is: Jackie was 70"" tall before the summer.}</s>","Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36"", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72"" tall

Step 1: Find the daily chocolate bar production.
The company produces 5000 chocolate bars in one day.

Step 2: Find out how many chocolate bars are produced in two weeks.
First, we need to find out how many days there are in two weeks. We know that one week has 7 days, so there are 14 days in two weeks.

So, the company produces:
5000 * 14 = 70,000 chocolate bars in 2 weeks

Step 3: Find the total revenue from selling these chocolate bars.
The company sells each chocolate bar for $2.

So, the total revenue is:
70,000 * $2/bar = $140,000

The final answer is: The company receives $140,000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks.</s>","During two weeks the company can produce 14 * 5000 = <<14*5000=70000>>70000.

- Jake bought 2 T-shirts.
- Each T-shirt originally costs $8.
- With the deal, Jake gets one T-shirt for free for each purchased T-shirt.
- So the cost of one T-shirt after the deal is $8 * (1 - 0.5) = $4.
- Therefore, the cost of both T-shirts is $4 * 2 = $8.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the shoes after the discount.
- Jake bought a pair of shoes.
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The shoes have a 40% discount.
- The discounted price is $40 * (1 - 0.4) = $24.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Jake spent at the store.
- The cost of the 2 T-shirts after the deal is $8.
- The cost of the pair of shoes after the discount is $24.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Ryan has after completing chores for 3 weeks and buying ice cream for himself and his friends.
Ryan's allowance per week = $6
Total amount of money he earned by completing chores for 3 weeks = $6 * 3 = $18
Amount of money he spent on ice cream = $1.25 * (1 + 3) = $5
So, total amount of money Ryan has = $18 + $5 = $23

Step 2: Determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining amount of money.
Since the cost of each movie ticket is $6.50, and Ryan has $23, we can calculate the number of movie tickets he can buy as follows:
Number of movie tickets = Total amount of money / Cost of each movie ticket
Number of movie tickets = $23 / $6.50 ≈ 3.53
Since Ryan cannot buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can only buy 3 movie tickets.

{The final answer is: Ryan can buy 3 movie tickets.}</s>","Ryan earned $6 x 3 weeks of chores = $<<6*3=18>>18.
He bought 1 for himself + 3 for his friends = <<1+3=4>>4 ice creams.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Randy initially has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.
{Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies + 4 chocolate chip cookies + 5 sugar cookies = 18 oatmeal cookies + 4 chocolate chip cookies + 5 sugar cookies = 27 cookies in total}

Step 2: Randy eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he eats 1 oatmeal cookie, 1 chocolate chip cookie, and 1 sugar cookie.
{Now, he has 9 oatmeal cookies + 4 chocolate chip cookies + 5 sugar cookies - 1 oatmeal cookie - 1 chocolate chip cookie - 1 sugar cookie = 9 oatmeal cookies + 4 chocolate chip cookies + 4 sugar cookies = 13 cookies in total}

Step 3: Randy eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.
{Now, he has 9 oatmeal cookies + 4 chocolate chip cookies + 4 sugar cookies - 2 oatmeal cookies = 7 oatmeal cookies + 4 chocolate chip cookies + 4 sugar cookies = 11 cookies in total}

Step 4: Randy gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends.
{Now, he has 7 oatmeal cookies + 4 chocolate chip cookies + 2 sugar cookies = 9 oatmeal cookies + 4 chocolate chip cookies = 13 cookies in total (since he didn't bake sugar cookies yet)}

Step 5: Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner.
{For each flavor, Randy bakes and eats:
- Oatmeal: 4 cookies (as stated), so he has 7 oatmeal cookies before baking
- Chocolate chip: 4 cookies (as stated), so he keeps 4 chocolate chip cookies
- Sugar: Since he gave 2 away before baking, he bakes 4 and keeps 8 (total of 10, but since we can only count 8 of them in his possession)}

So, Randy has 9 initial oatmeal cookies + 4 initial chocolate chip cookies + 5 initial sugar cookies - (1 oatmeal cookie eaten, 1 chocolate chip cookie eaten, 1 sugar cookie given away) + (4 oatmeal cookies baked, 4 chocolate chip cookies kept, 8 sugar cookies kept) = 14 oatmeal cookies (7 initial + 4 baked) + 4 chocolate chip cookies + 8 sugar cookies. {The final answer is 14 oatmeal cookies + 4 chocolate chip cookies + 8 sugar cookies = 26 cookies in total}</s>","Randy originally has 9+4+5 = <<9+4+5=18>>18 cookies in total.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of toy soldiers in Matthew's collection and calculate the number of toy soldiers in each half.
Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. To sell them in two parts, we need to divide the collection into two equal halves. Since 12 is an even number, it can be divided into two equal halves of 6 toys each.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Matthew would earn if he sells each half at the given prices.
For the first half of the toys, he would sell each toy for $5. So, the total earning for the first half would be:
First half earnings = Number of toys in the first half * Price per toy in the first half
First half earnings = 6 * $5
First half earnings = $30

Similarly, the second half of the toys would be sold at $7 per toy, so the total earning for the second half would be:
Second half earnings = Number of toys in the second half * Price per toy in the second half
Second half earnings = 6 * $7
Second half earnings = $42

Step 3: Determine the total amount of money Matthew would earn if he sells the entire collection to the buyer.
To find the total amount of money Matthew would earn, we need to add the earnings from both halves:
Total earnings = First half earnings + Second half earnings
Total earnings = $30 + $42
Total earnings = $72

{The final answer is: Matthew would earn a total of $72 if he sells his entire collection of 12 toy soldiers to the buyer.}</s>","Half of Matthew collection means 12 * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 toy soldiers.
A buyer wants to buy 6 toy soldiers for $5, so he would pay 6 * 5 = $<<6*5=30>>30 for them.
And for the other half, he wants to pay $7 per toy, which would sum up to 6 * 7 = $<<6*7=42>>42.
So if Matthew would agree to the buyer's offer, he would earn 30 + 42 = $<<30+42=72>>72.

- Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day.

Step 2: Calculate the number of holes dug during Nate's vacation.
- Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
- Multiply the number of holes dug per day by the number of vacation days: 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

Step 3: Determine how many holes Nate fills in when he's home.
- Nate fills in 9 holes a day.

Step 4: Calculate the number of holes filled in while Nate is home and the dog isn't digging.
- Divide the number of holes Nate fills in a day by the number of holes Nate didn't dig during vacation: 9 holes/day / 3 holes/day = 3 days.

Step 5: Take into account the new holes that the dog digs every night.
- Since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, there are an additional 6 holes dug for each 3-day period that Nate is home.

Step 6: Calculate the number of 3-day periods needed to fill all the holes.
- Divide the total number of holes by the number of holes filled during each 3-day period: 84 holes / (3 days * 9 holes/day) = 5.44 weeks; rounded up, it takes 6 weeks for Nate to fill in all the holes.

First, let's find out how many chocolate chip cookies they have made by subtracting the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies they've made:

Step 1: Find the total number of chocolate chip cookies
Total cookies made = 11,625
Number of rainbow cookies = 2,595
Number of oatmeal cookies = 3,075

Step 2: Calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies
Total cookies (Chocolate chip) = Total cookies made - Number of rainbow cookies - Number of oatmeal cookies
Total cookies (Chocolate chip) = 11,625 - 2,595 - 3,075
Total cookies (Chocolate chip) = 6,000

                 [/INST] To find out how long it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race, we first need to determine how far she ran. We know that she was able to run twice as far as Aaron, and Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.

Let's call the distance Vanessa ran ""x"" miles.

Since Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, his speed is 1 mile per 8 minutes (1 mile / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute).

We know that Vanessa runs twice as fast as Aaron, so her speed is 1 mile per 4 minutes (twice the speed of Aaron).

To find the distance Vanessa runs in 16 minutes (which is half of her total race time), we can use her speed:

1 mile / 4 minutes = 0.25 miles per minute

In 16 minutes, Vanessa runs 0.25 miles per minute * 16 minutes = 4 miles

Since Aaron finished his part of the race in 16 minutes running 2 miles, and Vanessa runs twice as fast, she must finish running 4 miles in:

4 miles / (2 miles per 16 minutes) = 8 minutes per mile

Therefore, it takes Vanessa 8 minutes to run 1 mile.

To find the time it took her to run her entire race (which was longer than 16 minutes), we divide her total distance by her running speed:

Total distance = 2 * Aaron's distance + Vanessa's extra distance (since Aaron and Vanessa together ran twice the distance of Aaron's part)
Total distance = 2 * 2 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles

To find the time it took Vanessa to run this distance:
Total time = Total distance / Her speed
Total time = 8 miles / (1 mile per 4 minutes) = 32 minutes

Since Aaron took 16 minutes for his part, and Vanessa took more than that for her part, Vanessa must have taken:

{The final answer is: 32 minutes - 16 minutes = 16 minutes + 16 minutes = 32 minutes for Vanessa to complete her part of the race}</s>","Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 miles.

                 [/INST] To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate how many feet of line he needs for the existing 200 feet of dock. Then, we add the extra 3 feet needed for every foot of dock to that amount.

Step 1: Calculate the number of feet of line required for the current 200 feet of dock.
3 feet of line needed for every foot of dock, so:
200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line/foot = <<200*3=600>>600 feet of line

Step 2: Calculate the number of feet of line the caretaker already has.
He has 6 feet of new line.

Step 3: Determine the total number of feet of line the caretaker needs.
First, let's find the deficiency of current line from the required amount for the dock: 600 feet needed - 6 feet currently having = <<600-6=594>>594 feet.
To this number, we add the current 6 feet of line: 594 feet + 6 feet = <<594+6=600>>600 feet.

{The final answer is: The caretaker needs to buy 0 feet of line in total.}

This answer is incorrect. Let's check our calculations.

Step 1: Calculate the number of feet of line required for the current 200 feet of dock.
3 feet of line needed for every foot of dock, so:
200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line/foot = 600 feet of line

Step 2: Calculate the number of feet of line the caretaker already has.
He has 6 feet of new line.

Step 3: Determine the total number of feet of line the caretaker needs.
First, let's find the deficiency of current line from the required amount for the dock: 600 feet needed - 206 feet currently having (200 feet of dock + 6 feet of new line) = 394 feet.

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 394 feet of new line.

{The final answer is: The caretaker needs to buy 394 feet of line.}</s>","200*3 = <<200*3=600>>600 feet of line.
The caretaker needs to buy 600-6 = <<600-6=594>>594 feet of line.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many reservations Tom's restaurant gets in a week.
- Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.
- They are open 2 days a week.

Calculation: Reservations per week = Reservations per night * Number of days open
Reservations per week = 6 * 2
Reservations per week = 12

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of meals ordered per reservation.
- Each meal costs $5.

Cost of meals per reservation = Cost of 2 meals * $5/meal
Cost of meals per reservation = 2 * $5
Cost of meals per reservation = $10

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of meals ordered per week.
- Tom's restaurant gets 12 reservations per week.
- Each reservation orders meals costing $10.

Total cost of meals per week = Reservations per week * Cost of meals per reservation
Total cost of meals per week = 12 * $10
Total cost of meals per week = $120

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of wine ordered per week.
- Each reservation orders a $5 bottle of wine.
- Tom's restaurant gets 12 reservations per week.

Total cost of wine per week = Reservations per week * Cost of wine per reservation
Total cost of wine per week = 12 * $5
Total cost of wine per week = $60

Step 5: Determine the total weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant.
- Total cost of meals per week
- Total cost of wine per week

Calculation: Total weekly revenue = Cost of meals per week + Cost of wine per week
Total weekly revenue = $120 + $60
Total weekly revenue = $180

{The final answer is}: Tom's restaurant makes $180 a week.</s>","The meals cost 2*5=$<<2*5=10>>10 per table

                    question:
                    ? A fruit . vendor . bought 50 watermelons ? for $80. He : sold , all of them at a , profit ; of . 25%. How ! much was : each ! watermelon sold?
                 [/INST] To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to determine how much profit the vendor made from selling all 50 watermelons.

Let's denote the selling price of each watermelon as x. Then, the total cost of the watermelons was $80, and the vendor sold them all at a profit of 25%. This means that the total revenue from selling all the watermelons was $80 + 0.25x, where x is the selling price of each watermelon.

Since the vendor sold all 50 watermelons, we have:

Total revenue = 50 * x

To find the selling price x, we need to set up an equation and solve it:

50x = $80 + 0.25x

First, let's get all the terms with x on one side:

49x = $80

Now, to find the value of x, divide both sides by 49:

x = $80 / 49

x ≈ $1632.65

However, this answer looks incorrect since it's not a reasonable price for a watermelon. Let's check our calculations:

First, we assumed that the profit percentage applied to the selling price. That might not be the case - it could be that 25% is the profit percentage related to the cost price. If that's the case, then the selling price would be $1.25 more than the cost price.

Let's revise our calculations based on this assumption:

Cost price of each watermelon = $80 / 50 = $160

Selling price for each watermelon = $160 + $1.25 = $161.25

So, the final answer is: Each watermelon was sold for $161.25.</s>","The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.
So, he was able to sell them all for $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.
Thus, the vendor sold each watermelon for $100/$50 = $<<100/50=2>>2 each.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that John had a son James when he was 19 years old.
2. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who is going to turn 12 in 3 years.
3. So, the current age of James can be calculated as follows:
   - James is twice as old as Dora, who is going to turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, James' age = 2 * (Dora's future age + 3)
   - Dora's future age = 12 (in 3 years) + 3 (current age) = 15
   - James' age = 2 * (15 + 3) = 31
4. We also know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old.
5. To find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years, we simply add 3 years to his current age:
   - John's youngest son's current age = 32
6. Therefore, his age in 3 years = 32 + 3 = 35

The final answer is: John's youngest son will be 35 years old in 3 years.</s>","Dora is 12-3=<<12-3=9>>9
So James is 9*2=<<9*2=18>>18 years old
That means John is 18+19=<<18+19=37>>37
Johns youngest son is 37-32=<<37-32=5>>5 years old
So he will be 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 in 3 years

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. we have a certain number of oranges in a basket.
2. Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange.
3. Jane takes 4 minutes to peel an orange.
4. Both Ana and Jane start peeling oranges from the basket at the same time.
5. We want to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled after an hour.

To calculate the number of oranges each person peels in an hour, we first need to find out how many oranges they can peel in one minute, and then multiply that by the number of minutes in an hour.

- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so she peels 1 orange in 3 minutes. To find out how many oranges she peels in one minute, we divide the number of oranges by the number of minutes it takes: Ana peels 1 orange / 3 minutes = 1/3 oranges per minute.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so she peels 1 orange in 4 minutes. To find out how many oranges she peels in one minute, we divide the number of oranges by the number of minutes it takes: Jane peels 1 orange / 4 minutes = 1/4 oranges per minute.

Now that we know the rate at which each person can peel oranges, we can calculate how many oranges they will have peeled after an hour (60 minutes):

- Ana peels 1/3 orange per minute and works for 60 minutes, so she peels 1/3 * 60 = 20 oranges in total.
- Jane peels 1/4 orange per minute and works for 60 minutes, so she peels 1/4 * 60 = 15 oranges in total.

To find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane, we subtract the number of oranges Jane has peeled from the number of oranges Ana has peeled:

The final answer is: Ana peels 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.</s>","There are 60 minutes in an hour. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes so she will peel 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 oranges in an hour
Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes so she will peel 60/4 = <<60/4=15>>15 oranges in an hour
Ana will have peeled 20-15 = <<20-15=5>>5 more oranges

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the original cost of the new radiator for Mark.
Mark needs a new radiator that costs $400.

Step 2: Find the discounted price of the radiator at the junk shop.
Mark gets the radiator at a discount of 80%, so the discounted price is $400 * (1 - 0.8) = $80.
Since the price was reduced by $320, the cost Mark paid for the radiator at the junk shop is $400 + $320 = $720.

Step 3: Find the total cost of installing the new radiator.
The mechanic charges $50 an hour, and it takes him 3 hours to install the radiator. So the cost of the installation is $50/hour * 3 hours = $150.

Step 4: Find the total amount Mark paid for the new radiator and its installation.
The cost Mark paid for the radiator was $720, and the cost of the installation was $150.
Therefore, Mark paid a total of $720 + $150 = $870 for the new radiator and its installation.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's assume that all the animals are cows. In that case, we know that each cow has 4 legs. So, if there are 20 animals and they're all cows, they would have a total of 20 * 4 = 80 legs.

Step 2: However, the problem states that there are a total of 70 legs on the farm. This is 10 legs less than what we calculated in Step 1. So, we need to find where those 10 legs came from.

Step 3: Since a cow has 4 legs and 20 animals were previously assumed to be cows, we know that at least 15 animals must be chickens, which have 2 legs each. So, 15 chickens would have 15 * 2 = 30 legs.

Step 4: Subtracting the legs from cows (80) from the total legs given in the problem (70), we find that there must be 80 - 70 = 10 fewer cows than initially assumed. Since each cow has 4 legs, this means that 10 fewer animals * 4 legs = 10 * 4 = 40 legs came from cows.

Step 5: The legs from chickens are 70 - 40 = 30. Since each chicken has 2 legs, there must be 30 * 2 / 2 = 15 more chickens than initially assumed.

Step 6: In summary, there are 15 + 15 = 30 chickens and 20 - 15 = 5 chickens in the farm, making a total of 5 + 30 = 35 animals. The number of legs is equally distributed between the animals, so we have 30 legs from chickens and 70 - 30 = 40 legs from cows. Therefore,

{The final answer is: There are 35 animals on the farm, consisting of 30 chickens and 5 cows.}</s>","Let C be the number of chickens.
There are 20-C cows.
The cows have 4*(20-C) legs.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem
- Henry and 3 of his friends are ordering pizzas for lunch.
- They are ordering 7 pizzas in total.
- Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- They want to share the pizzas equally among themselves.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices
- Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is: 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Step 3: Find out how many slices each person will get
- If they want to share the slices equally, we simply divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry included): Total slices / Number of people = Slices per person
- So, the calculation is: 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person. However, since we cannot divide the total number of slices evenly, some remaining slices must be dealt with. In this case, one person will have an extra slice.
- {The final answer is: Each person will get 14 slices and one person will get 15 slices.}

Explanation: Since there are 56 slices and 4 people, we would ideally expect each person to receive 14 slices (56/4). However, since one pizza only produces 8 slices, we cannot divide the total number of slices evenly among 4 people. Therefore, one person will have to receive an additional slice, resulting in 14 slices for 3 people and 15 slices for the last person.</s>","There are 7*8=<<7*8=56>>56 slices in total.
