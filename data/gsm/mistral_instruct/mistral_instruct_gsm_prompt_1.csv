                    question:
                    A landscaping company is delivering flagstones to a customer’s yard. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. If the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip?
                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many pounds' worth of flagstones one truck can carry. We know that each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so we can find the total weight of one truck's load by multiplying the weight of one flagstone by the number of flagstones one truck can carry.

{Let's calculate how many flagstones one truck can carry.}
{The weight of one flagstone is 75 pounds.}
{We want to find the number of flagstones one truck can carry, so we'll divide the total weight capacity of the truck by the weight of one flagstone.}
{So, the number of flagstones one truck can carry is 2000 pounds / 75 pounds/flagstone = 26.67 flagstones/truck, but since we can't have a fraction of a flagstone, we'll need to round this up to the nearest whole number.}
{So, one truck can carry 27 flagstones.}

Now, we can find out how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

{Let's calculate how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones.}
{We know that one truck can carry 27 flagstones.}
{To find out how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we'll divide the total number of flagstones by the number of flagstones one truck can carry.}
{So, the number of trucks needed is 80 flagstones / 27 flagstones/truck = 2.96 trucks, but since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we'll need to round this up to the nearest whole number.}
{So, we'll need 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.}

{The final answer is, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.}</s>",3

                    question:
                    John collects peaches for 3 hours.  He can collect 2 peaches a minute.  How many peaches does he collect?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate how many peaches John collects in one minute.
John collects 2 peaches a minute.

Step 2: Determine how many peaches John collects in 3 hours.
First, we need to convert 3 hours to minutes (60 minutes per hour): 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.
Then, multiply the number of peaches collected per minute by the total number of minutes: 2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches.

{The final answer is: John collects 360 peaches in 3 hours.}</s>",360
