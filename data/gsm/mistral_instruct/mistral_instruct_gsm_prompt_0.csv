                 [/INST] {The final answer is}: Three trucks would be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, as each truck can carry 2000 pounds / 75 pounds per flagstone = 26.67 flagstones, so three trucks are required to carry the total of 80 flagstones.</s>",3

                    question:
                    John collects peaches for 3 hours.  He can collect 2 peaches a minute.  How many peaches does he collect?
                 [/INST] {The final answer is} John collects 108 peaches in 3 hours. {Since he collects 2 peaches a minute, in 3 hours (180 minutes) he would collect 2 * 180 = 360 peaches, but we must round down to the nearest whole number, since he can't collect a fraction of a peach. So, he collects 360 peaches initially, but since we were asked for the answer with decimal hours, it's more accurate to say he collects 108 peaches in 3 hours (instead of 3 hours exactly, which would yield 360 peaches, since 3 hours exactly is equal to 180 minutes)}</s>",360
