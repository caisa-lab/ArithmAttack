She sells ; the remainder at the farmers' market daily for . $2 per fresh duck egg. How ? much ; in dollars does ; she make , every day ; at : the farmers' market?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many eggs Janet has left after eating and baking.
- Janet lays 16 eggs per day.
- She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she uses 3 eggs each day.
- She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends.
- So, Janet uses 3 + 4 = <ins>7</ins> eggs per day.
- Therefore, she has 16 - 7 = <ins>9</ins> eggs left each day.

Step 2: Calculate the revenue Janet earns from selling eggs at the farmers' market.
- Janet has 9 eggs left after baking.
- She sells these eggs for $2 per egg at the farmers' market.
- So, she earns 9 * $2 = <ins>$18</ins> per day from selling eggs.

The final answer is: Janet makes $18 in dollars every day at the farmers' market.</s>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

                 [/INST] To find the total number of bolts of fiber required to make the robe, we first need to find out how many bolts of each color are needed.

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. It takes half that much white fiber, which is (1/2) * 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Therefore, the robe requires a total of 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = {The final answer is: 3 bolts of fiber}.</s>","It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric

"Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value . of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?","<s> [INST] 
                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value . of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
                 [/INST] To find out how much profit Josh made, we first need to find out the new value of the house after the repairs.

Let's call the original value of the house X. Josh bought the house for $80,000, so X = $80,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. Let V be the value of the house after the repairs. We can set up an equation: V = X + $50,000, where $50,000 is the cost of the repairs.

According to the problem, the repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. Thus, V = 1.15X.

Now we need to find the difference between the value of the house after repairs and the cost of the house. This is the profit Josh made.

Profit = V - $80,000

Substituting V = 1.15X in the equation for profit:

Profit = 1.15X - $80,000

Finding the numerical value for the profit requires knowing the exact value of X, but since we know that X = $80,000, we can substitute that value and solve for the profit.

Profit = 1.15($80,000) - $80,000
     = $92,000 - $80,000
     = $12,000.

{The final answer is $12,000.}</s>","The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

Step 1: James runs 3 sprints in a week. Each sprint is 60 meters long.

Step 2: To find out how many meters James runs in a week, we need to find the total distance he covers in all his sprints in a week.

Step 3: The total distance James runs in a week is equal to the number of sprints he runs in a week multiplied by the length of each sprint:

Total distance = Number of sprints per week * Length of each sprint

Step 4: From the problem statement, we know that James runs 3 sprints every week and each sprint is 60 meters long.

Step 5: Plugging these values into our equation:

Total distance = 3 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint

Step 6: Multiplying:

Total distance = 180 meters/week

{The final answer is: James runs a total of 180 meters every week.}</s>","He sprints 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 times

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many cups of feed Wendi gives to her chickens in total per day.
- Wendi feeds three cups of feed to each chicken every day.
- She has 20 chickens in her flock.

Total cups of feed per day = Number of chickens * Cups of feed per chicken
Total cups of feed per day = 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken
Total cups of feed per day = 60 cups

Step 2: Determine how many cups of feed Wendi gives her chickens in each meal.
She gives them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon.

Step 3: Determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day.
First, find out how many cups of feed she hasn't given them yet. Since she gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, and there are 60 cups in total, we can find out how many cups were given:

Total cups given = 15 cups (morning) + 25 cups (afternoon)
Total cups given = 40 cups

Now, we need to find out how many cups of feed are left for the final meal:

Cups for the final meal = Total cups per day (60 cups) - Total cups given (40 cups)
Cups for the final meal = 60 cups - 40 cups
Cups for the final meal = 20 cups 

{The final answer is: Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day}</s>","If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.

                    ? Kylar , went to : the store to . buy glasses , for , his new apartment. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy ; 16 : glasses. How much does he . need to pay , for . them?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the cost of each glass.
One glass costs $5.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the second glass.
Every second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass. So, the cost of the second glass is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Step 3: Calculate the number of first and second glasses Kylar wants to buy.
Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses in total. Since the first 15 glasses cost $5 each and the 16th glass costs $3, the number of first and second glasses are:
Number of first glasses = 15
Number of second glasses = 1

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of first glasses.
Total cost of first glasses = Number of first glasses * Cost of each first glass
Total cost of first glasses = 15 * $5
Total cost of first glasses = $75

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of second glasses.
Total cost of second glasses = Number of second glasses * Cost of each second glass
Total cost of second glasses = 1 * $3
Total cost of second glasses = $3

Step 6: Calculate the total cost of all glasses.
Total cost of all glasses = Total cost of first glasses + Total cost of second glasses
Total cost of all glasses = $75 + $3
Total cost of all glasses = $78

{The final answer is: $78}</s>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

1. T = 2C
2. C = 4S

Substituting the first equation into the second one gives us:

T = 8S

Now, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep (S = 20), so we can find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse:

C = 4S = 4 * 20 = 80
T = 8S = 8 * 20 = 160

Therefore, Charleston has 80 sheep and Toulouse has 160 sheep. Together, they have:

1. Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
2. She downloads 200 GB file. The time it takes to download the file completely, without any interruptions, is: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.
3. However, 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates. Since she has downloaded 40% of the file, she has downloaded 200 GB * 0.4 = 80 GB.
4. The interruption takes 20 minutes to complete.
5. After the interruption, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, the total time taken to download the file is the time taken before the interruption + the interruption time + the time taken after the interruption to download the remaining portion of the file.
6. The time taken before the interruption is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.
7. After the interruption, she downloads the remaining portion of the file of size 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB). The time taken to download this portion is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

2. John then turns around and spends the next 2 hours in standstill traffic, not covering any distance.
3. For the next half-hour (30 minutes), John drives at a speed of 30 mph. To find the distance he covers in this half-hour, we use the formula: 0.5 hours × 30 mph = 15 miles
4. For the remaining 1.5 hours, John drives at a constant speed of 80 mph. The distance covered is: 1.5 hours × 80 mph = 120 miles
5. To find the total distance John travels during the entire 4 hours, we add the distances covered during each segment of the journey: 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles

                    question:
                    Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will : cost $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 : lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. , It costs $3 a year to water and feed ! the tree. How many years ; will ; it take before he ? starts earning money on the lemon ! tree?
                 [/INST] To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate when the annual earnings from selling the lemons will exceed the annual costs of planting and maintaining the tree.

Step 1: Calculate the annual earnings from selling the lemons:
- Each year, the lemon tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Annual earnings = Production of lemons × Price per lemon
- Annual earnings = 7 lemons × $1.5/lemon
- Annual earnings = $10.50

Step 2: Calculate the annual costs:
- Annual cost of watering and feeding = $3
- Annual cost of planting = $90 (one-time cost, but we will divide it by the number of years to find the annual cost)
- Annual cost = $90 (one-time cost) ÷ Number of Years

Step 3: Compare the annual earnings and annual costs:
- In order for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, the annual earnings must be greater than the annual costs.
- We can set up an equation to find the number of years it takes for the annual earnings to exceed the annual costs:
- $10.50 (annual earnings) > $3 (annual costs) + $X (initial investment)

Step 4: Find the number of years:
- To find the number of years, we need to find the value of X that makes the equation true.
- We know that the initial investment is $90.
- $10.50 > $3 + $90
- $10.50 > $93
- Annual earnings are not enough to exceed the annual costs and initial investment in the first year.
- We need to check the next year's earnings and costs.

Step 5: Check the next year's earnings and costs:
- In the second year, the tree will produce 81 lemons (7 lemons ×2 years).
- Annual earnings = 81 lemons ×$1.5/lemon
- Annual earnings = $121.50

Step 6: Compare the annual earnings and annual costs in the second year:
- $121.50 (annual earnings) > $3 (annual costs) + $90 (initial investment)
- $121.50 > $93
- The equation is still not true.

Step 7: Check the next year's earnings and costs:
- In the third year, the tree will produce 924 lemons (7 lemons×numberofyears).
- Annual earnings = 924 lemons ×$1.5/lemon
- Annual earnings = $1386

Step 8: Compare the annual earnings and annual costs in the third year:
- $1386 (annual earnings) > $3 (annual costs) + $90 (initial investment)
- $1386 > $93
- The equation is now true.

Step 9: The final answer:
{It will take 3 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.}</s>","He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5
He earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5
It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as x.

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house: x/3 vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house.

Let y be the number of vacuum cleaners she had left after selling to the green and red houses.

4. Half of what was left was sold at the orange house: y/2 vacuum cleaners.
5. Therefore, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold is x/3 + 2 + y/2.
6. We know that she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:  x/3 + 2 + y/2 = 5
7. Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction y, we get: 2x/3 + y = 10
8. Solving for y, we can subtract 2x/3 from both sides of the equation: y = 2x/3 + 10
9. Now, we need to find an integer value of x that satisfies the equation. We can test some possibilities:

If x = 6: 2x/3 = 4; 4 + 10 = 14 => 14 is not an integer.

If x = 9: 2x/3 = 6; 6 + 10 = 16 => 16 is not an integer.

If x = 12: 2x/3 = 8; 8 + 10 = 18 => 18 is an integer.

Thus, Melanie started with 12 vacuum cleaners.

{The final answer is 12}</s>","First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10
Then add two to figure out how many vacuum cleaners she had before visiting the red house: 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12
Now we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18

                 [/INST] To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to find out how many students enrolled in each dance style and then add up the number of students in jazz and contemporary dance to find the total number of students in those styles. We'll then subtract that number from the total number of students to find out how many students are in hip-hop dance.

First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance:
Number of students in contemporary dance = Total number of students * Percentage enrolled in contemporary dance
Number of students = 20 * 0.2 = 4

Next, let's find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance:
Number of students in jazz dance = (Total number of students - Number of students in contemporary dance) * Percentage enrolled in jazz dance
Number of students = (20 - 4) * 0.25 = 4.5
Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, so there are 5 students in jazz dance.

Now let's find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
Number of students in hip-hop dance = Total number of students - Number of students in contemporary dance - Number of students in jazz dance
Number of students = 20 - 4 - 5 = 11

So, {The final answer is, 55% of the students enrolled in either contemporary or jazz dance. The remaining 45% of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.} 

But the question asked for the percentage of students in hip-hop dance, not the percentage of students not in contemporary or jazz dance. We made an error in interpreting the problem statement, thus, the final answer may not be correct based on the given information. To calculate the correct percentage of students in hip-hop dance, we need to know the exact number of students in contemporary and jazz dance, not just the percentage they represent of the total student population.</s>","There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.

There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Step 2: Find out how many eggs Claire uses in one day.Since she makes one omelet for breakfast each day,
1 day = 1 omelet = 3 eggs

Step 3: Find out how many eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks. To do this, we first need to determine how many days there are in 4 weeks. We know that:
1 week = 7 days
So,
4 weeks = 4 x 7 = 28 days

Therefore,
1 month = 4 weeks = 28 days

So,
Eggs used in 1 month = Eggs used per day * Number of days in a month
= 3 eggs * 28 days

                 [/INST] To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to determine her total time spent hiking and the total distance covered.

Step 1: Find the total time spent hiking
- Marissa spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles.
- She spent another hour walking the next 2 miles.

Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Step 2: Determine the total distance covered
- Marissa walked 4 miles in the first hour.
- She walked another 2 miles in the second hour.

Total distance = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles

Step 3: Calculate her current average speed
- Marissa's current average speed is 6 miles divided by the total time spent hiking, which is 2 hours.

Average speed = 6 miles / 2 hours
Average speed = 3 miles per hour

Step 4: Determine the remaining distance
- The total trail is 12 miles long.
- Marissa has covered 6 miles at an average speed of 3 miles per hour.

Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Step 5: Find the speed needed to maintain a 4 mph average speed
- Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire hike.
- To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance to maintain this average, we set up the following equation:
Total distance / Total time = Average speed
6 miles (total distance) / (Time for remaining distance + Total time) = 4 miles per hour

We need to solve for the time for the remaining distance. First, let's rearrange the equation:

Time for remaining distance = (Total distance / Average speed) - Total time

Since we know the total distance, the average speed, and the total time, we can calculate the time for the remaining distance:

Time for remaining distance = (6 miles / 4 miles per hour) - 2 hours

Calculating the value inside the parentheses:

Time for remaining distance = 1.5 hours - 2 hours = -0.5 hours

Since time cannot be negative, we made a mistake in our calculation. Let's try to find the speed instead:

Speed for remaining distance = (Total distance / Time for remaining distance)
Speed for remaining distance = (6 miles / 0.5 hours)
Speed for remaining distance = 12 miles per hour

However, this speed is not feasible for Marissa, as it is higher than the given average speed. Therefore, it is unlikely for her to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike by walking a constant speed of 12 miles per hour for the remaining distance.

{The final answer is: It is unlikely for Marissa to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike by walking a constant speed of 12 miles per hour for the remaining distance.}</s>","First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours

Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph

1. We start with 10 liters of orange drink, which is two-thirds water. So, the amount of water in the orange drink is (2/3) * 10 = 6.67 liters (rounded to two decimal places).
2. Spilling one liter of orange drink, we now have 9 liters of orange drink left.
3. We add this 9 liters of orange drink to 15 liters of pineapple drink.
4. The pineapple drink is three-fifths water. So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters.
5. To find the total amount of water in both the orange and pineapple drinks, we add the water in the orange drink to the water in the pineapple drink: 6.67 liters (orange) + 9 liters (pineapple) = 15.67 liters (rounded to two decimal places).
6. We started with 25 liters of liquids (10 liters orange + 15 liters pineapple), but spilled 1 liter of orange drink, leaving us with 24 liters of liquids. Since we've determined that there are 15.67 liters of water in the 24 liters, the final answer is:

Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.

                 [/INST] To find the answer, we need to calculate the total amount of melting that occurs during the given time period. We know that the candle melts 2 cm every hour. Let's calculate how many hours represent the time span from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

First, let's find out how many hours are in the given time period:
- 1:00 PM is represented as 13:00 hours (24-hour clock), so the first hour is 13.
- 5:00 PM is represented as 17:00 hours
- The time difference between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM is therefore 17 - 13 = 4 hours.

Now we can calculate how many centimeters the candle will have melted during this time:
- The candle melts 2 cm every hour
- It melts for a total of 4 hours, so

Total melting = Melting per hour * Number of hours
Total melting = 2 cm * 4
Total melting = 8 cm

{The final answer is: The candle will be 8 cm shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.}</s>","The candle burns for 5 - 1 = <<5-1=4>>4 hours.

                 [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's find the cost of the items we know the quantity and price for:
   - Chicken meal: $12
   - Milk (5 packs): $3 * 5 = $15
   - Apples (4): $1.50 * 4 = $6
   - Total cost for known items: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

2. We know Marie paid a total of $50. Subtract the known costs to find the cost of the pizza:
   - Total cost: $50
   - Cost of known items: $33
   - Difference: $50 - $33 = $17

3. We know each pizza box costs $8.50. Divide the difference in cost by the cost per box to find the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered:
   - Cost of pizza boxes: $17
   - Cost per box: $8.50
   - Number of pizza boxes: $17 / $8.50 ≈ 2

4. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up due to the uncertainty of whether the cost of the chicken meal, milk, or apples includes tax or other hidden fees:
   - The final answer is: Marie ordered 3 boxes of pizza.</s>","Five packs of milk cost $3 x 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
Four apples cost $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.5*4=6>>6.
The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $<<12+15+6=33>>33.
Thus, the boxes of pizza cost $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.
Therefore, Marie ordered $17/$8.50 = <<17/8.5=2>>2 boxes of pizza.

1. Cost of one pair of shorts: $16.50
2. Cost of one pair of pants: $22.50
3. Cost of one pair of shoes: $42

We know Mishka bought 3 pairs of each type of clothing, so the total amount she spent is:

Total amount = (Cost of one pair of shorts * Number of pairs of shorts) + (Cost of one pair of pants * Number of pairs of pants) + (Cost of one pair of shoes * Number of pairs of shoes)

Total amount = ($16.50 * 3) + ($22.50 * 3) + ($42 * 3)

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia buys in 60 days.
Since she eats one serving every night, in one day she uses one serving. So, she needs one carton in 15 days (because there are 15 servings in one carton).

Cartons needed in 60 days = Total days / Days per carton
= 60 / 15
= 4 cartons

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of ice cream for 60 days.
Cost of one carton = $4.00
Cost of 4 cartons = Cost of one carton * Number of cartons
= $4.00 * 4
= $16.00

                 [/INST] To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distances of each leg of his journey. Let's break it down step by step:
1. Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip. The first stop was after 20 miles.
2. The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

First, let's find the distance of the first leg of Henry's journey between his first stop and the second stop. We know he traveled 20 miles for the first leg.
{So, the first leg of the journey is 20 miles.}

Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the length of the second leg of the journey must be the remaining distance after the first stop. The total distance of the trip was 60 miles. Subtract the miles Henry traveled during the first leg to find the miles of the second leg.
{60 miles (total distance) - 20 miles (first leg) = 40 miles (second leg)}

Therefore, the total distance Henry traveled during his bike trip was 60 miles, which he covered in two legs. The first leg was 20 miles, and the second leg was 40 miles.

1. Gloria is considering buying a pair of boots that fit her shoe budget. Let's call the cost of the boots ""B"".
2. She also has the option to buy two pairs of high heels instead. The first pair of heels costs ""$33"" and the second pair costs ""twice as much"" as the first pair. Let's call the cost of the second pair ""2 * $33 = $66"".
3. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is ""$33 + $66 = $99"".
4. The boots cost less than the two pairs of high heels by ""$99 - B = $66"".
5. Since the difference in cost between the boots and the high heels is $66, the cost of the boots must be ""$B = $33 + $66 = $99"".

{The final answer is $99 for the cost of the boots.}</s>","The second pair of heels costs 33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.

                 [/INST] To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on their age ratio and their total age of 162.

Step 1: Let's assign the variable X to Darrell's age and Y to Allen's age, knowing that their ages have a 7:11 ratio.

Step 2: Set up an algebraic equation representing the ratio of their ages:

X / 7 = Y / 11

Step 3: Solve the equation for Y in terms of X:

Y = (11 * X) / 7

Step 4: Now that we have the relationship between their current ages, let's find their current ages using the total age of 162:

7X + 11Y = 162

Step 5: Substitute Y from the age ratio equation into the total age equation:

7X + 11 * (11 * X / 7) = 162

Step 6: Simplify the equation:

7X + 11 * (X / 7) = 162

Step 7: Multiply both sides of the equation by 7 to eliminate the fraction:

7X + X = 1136

Step 8: Add X to both sides:

8X = 1136

Step 9: Divide both sides by 8 to find X (Darrell's age):

X = 142

Step 10: Find Allen's age based on the age ratio and Darrell's age:

Allen's age = Y = (11 * Darrell's age / 7) = (11 * 142 / 7)

Step 11: Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now:

Allen's age 10 years from now = Allen's age + 10 = (11 * 142 / 7) + 10

{The final answer is: Allen's age 10 years from now = 176.6}

However, since ages are typically whole numbers, it's important to consider that this answer may represent a rounded approximation. The true answer may require further calculations to get an exact whole number for Allen's age 10 years from now based on the given ratio and total age.</s>","The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18

1. We're given that Aaron has X jewels and Siobhan has X - 2 jewels.
2. We're also given that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
3. Raymond has 40 jewels.

Let H represent the number of jewels that Raymond has, so we know that H = 40.

From the second piece of information, we have Aaron = H/2 + 5, or H = 2Aaron - 10.

Now, we have Siobhan's number of jewels, which is X - 2, where X is Aaron's number of jewels.

Substitute Aaron's expression into this: Siobhan = X - 2 = (2Aaron - 10) - 2.

Now, substitute H for 2Aaron from the first equation: Siobhan = (2(H + 10) - 10) - 2.

Solving this expression will give us the final answer for Siobhan's number of jewels.

{The final answer is (2H + 18) - 4}

So the answer to the problem is that Siobhan has 2H + 14 jewels.</s>","Half of Raymond's jewels is 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20
Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, he has 20+5 = <<5+20=25>>25 jewels.

Step 2: In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 25% of 4 points.

Step 3: To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply the percentage by the total amount, and then divide by 100 to get the actual amount. So, 25% of 4 points = 4 points * 0.25 = 1 point.

Step 4: Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

Step 5: To find the total number of points Mike scored, we sum the number of points he scored in both 20-minute intervals. So, Total points = Points in first 20 minutes + Points in second 20 minutes = 4 points + 5 points = 9 points.

                 [/INST] First, let's calculate the price of one yogurt when they are on sale. Since each yogurt is $1.25 when not on sale, and they are now $5.00 for 4 yogurts, we can find the price of one yogurt on sale by dividing the cost of 4 yogurts by the number of yogurts:

Price of one yogurt on sale = Cost of 4 yogurts / Number of yogurts
Price of one yogurt on sale = $5.00 / 4
Price of one yogurt on sale = $1.25

Now that we know the price of one yogurt on sale, we can calculate how much Terry spends on yogurt per day:

Cost per day = Price of one yogurt on sale * Number of yogurts eaten per day
Cost per day = $1.25 * 2
Cost per day = $2.50

To find the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we just need to multiply this daily cost by the number of days:

Total cost = Cost per day * Number of days
Total cost = $2.50 * 30
Total cost = $75.00

{The final answer is $75.00}.</s>","He eats 2 yogurts a day so over 30 days he will need 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 yogurts

                 [/INST] To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling all his Lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

1. John has 13 Lego sets, and he sells each set for $15. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes from selling all his Lego sets is:
   Money from selling Lego sets = Number of sets * Price per set
   = 13 * $15
   = $195

2. John buys 8 video games, and each game costs $20. So, the total amount of money he spends on video games is:
   Money spent on video games = Number of games * Price per game
   = 8 * $20
   = $160

3. We are told that John has $5 left. To find out the total amount of money he had before spending it on video games, we can subtract the amount he spent on video games from the amount he made from selling Lego sets:
   Total money before video games = Money from selling Lego sets - Money spent on video games
   = $195 - $160
   = $35

4. Since John had $35 before buying video games, and we know that each Lego set sells for $15, we can find out how many Lego sets he still has by dividing the total money before video games by the price per Lego set:
   Number of sets still left = Total money before video games / Price per set
   = $35 / $15
   ≈ 2.33

However, since John can't have a fraction of a Lego set, he must still have 2 complete sets. Therefore, John has 2 more Lego sets. {The final answer is: John still has 15 Lego sets (13 sold + 2 left).}

Note: There seems to be a mistake in the question as the number of sets John has at the end should be 15 instead of 13 (13 sold + 2 left).

                 [/INST] To find out how fast John runs per hour, we first need to calculate how many miles he runs per hour on each day, and then find the total miles he runs per hour across all three days.

1. We know that John runs 3 hours on the first day, so he covers 60 miles in 3 hours.
   - Distance covered in one hour on the first day: 60 miles / 3 hours = 20 miles per hour (mph)

2. We also know that he runs half as much time on the other two days, so he runs for 1.5 hours per day on those days.
   - Distance covered in one hour on the other days: 60 miles / (3 hours * 2) = 10 miles per hour

3. The total number of hours John runs per week is 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours/week.

4. To find his average speed per hour across all three running days in a week, we need to find the harmonic mean of his speeds on the first day (20 mph) and the other days (10 mph).
   - Harmonic Mean = 2 * (Speed1 * Speed2) / (Speed1 + Speed2)
   - Harmonic Mean = 2 * (20 mph * 10 mph) / (20 mph + 10 mph) = 13.33 mph (approximated)

{The final answer is: John runs at approximately 13.33 miles per hour.}</s>","He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.
He runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.

                    question:
                    Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a ? rate of speed that is half as fast ? as . she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per ! hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?
                 [/INST] Let's denote Dana's walking speed as W. Since Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk, her running speed is 4W.

We're given that when she skips, she goes half as fast as when she runs. So her skipping speed S is given by:

S = 0.5 * R
S = 0.5 * 4W
S = 2W

However, the problem states that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. To resolve this inconsistency, let's assume the given skipping speed of 3 miles per hour is a typo and intended to be 2 miles per hour (since that's what we calculated based on the given information).

Now, we need to find how far Dana can travel in six hours spent one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. First, let's find the distance she can cover running:

Running distance = Time spent running * Running speed
Running distance = (1/3) * 6 hours * 4W
Running distance = 4W * 2 hours
Running distance = 8W

Next, let's find the distance she can cover walking:

Walking distance = Time spent walking * Walking speed
Walking distance = (2/3) * 6 hours * W
Walking distance = 2W * 4 hours
Walking distance = 8W

To find the total distance Dana can travel in six hours, add the running distance and the walking distance:

Total Distance = Running distance + Walking distance
Total Distance = 8W + 8W
Total Distance = 16W

{The final answer is 16W miles}</s>","If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

Given that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet, we can use this distance as our starting point.

Step 2: Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the sapphire gemstone.
Polly can throw the javelin three times farther when holding the gemstone, so the new distance is:
400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet

Step 3: Determine the maximum safe distance from the dragon.
The dragon's flames reach up to a distance of 1000 feet, so to ensure Polly is safely outside the dragon's reach while still able to hit it, the minimum safe distance would be:
1200 feet (Polly's maximum throwing distance with the gemstone) - (approximately) 1000 feet (dragon's flame reach)

Step 4: Calculate the minimum safe distance.
1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total calories in the 300g bag of chips.
Each serving size has 250 calories, and there are 5 servings in the 300g bag. So, the total calories in the 300g bag is:
Total calories = Serving size * Number of servings
Total calories = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings
Total calories = 1250 calories

Step 2: Determine the remaining calories you can consume to meet your daily calorie target.
Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the number of calories you can still consume is:
Remaining calories = Daily calorie target - Calories already consumed
Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories
Remaining calories = 200 calories

Step 3: Calculate the number of grams of chips you can eat.
Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, the number of grams of chips in one serving can be determined using the caloric density (the number of calories per gram) of potato chips, which is approximately 1,670 kcal/kg (or 1,670 calories per 100 gram). We can find the number of grams of chips that have 250 calories as follows:
250 calories / 1,670 calories/kg = 0.1499 kg
Since potato chips usually have a slightly higher caloric density (due to oil content), we assume a factor of 1.2 to account for the oil. Thus:
Number of grams = 0.1499 kg * 1.2 = approximately 0.1839 kg = 184 grams

Finally, we can calculate the number of grams of chips you can eat based on the remaining calories and the caloric density:
Number of grams = Remaining calories / Caloric density
Number of grams = 200 calories / 1,670 calories/kg = approximately 0.1205 kg = 121 grams

{The final answer is: You can eat approximately 121 grams of chips.}</s>","If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat
If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams

1. First, let's calculate how many pounds of beeswax he needs to make 20 candles:
   Since he can make 10 tapered candles from one pound of beeswax, then to make 20 candles, he will need:
   {Number of pounds of beeswax = Total number of candles / Number of candles per pound}
   = 20 candles / 10 candles per pound
   = 2 pounds

2. Next, let's calculate the total cost of supplies for making these 20 candles:
   {Cost of supplies per pound of beeswax = $10.00}
   = $10.00/pound * 2 pounds
   = $20.00

3. Now, let's calculate the total revenue he gets from selling these 20 candles:
   {Revenue per candle = $2.00}
   = $2.00/candle * 20 candles
   = $40.00

4. To find the net profit, we need to subtract the total cost of supplies from the total revenue:
   Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost of supplies
   = $40.00 - $20.00
   = $20.00

{The final answer is $20.00}</s>","1 pound of beeswax and the wick make 10 candles and he wants to make 20 candles so he needs 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 pounds of beeswax

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate . the total number of hours , she spent writing articles in the three days.
                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. The time it takes to write one article is 4 hours. So, the number of hours she spent writing articles on Monday is: 5 articles * 4 hours/article = 20 hours.

2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 2 * 5 * (2/5) = 4 articles. And the number of hours she spent writing articles on Tuesday is: 4 articles * 4 hours/article = 16 hours.

3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday is 4 articles * 2 = 8 articles. And the number of hours she spent writing articles on Wednesday is: 8 articles * 4 hours/article = 32 hours.

4. To find the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days, we add up the hours she spent on each day: 20 hours (Monday) + 16 hours (Tuesday) + 32 hours (Wednesday) = 68 hours.

                 [/INST] Let's work through this problem step by step:

1. We know that Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. After using one note per cup for 220 cups of coffee, she had 23 notes remaining.
2. To find out how many notes were in the package she purchased, we first need to determine how many notes she used in total. To do this, we'll sum the number she started with (80) and the ones she used (220).
3. 80 (notes Candice started with) + 220 (notes she used at work) = 300 notes in total
4. We know that Candice had 300 notes in total and had 23 notes remaining, so the number of notes in the package she purchased is:
5. 300 (total notes) - 23 (remaining notes) = 277 notes in the package

{The final answer is: Candice purchased a package of 277 Post-it notes}.</s>","Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of blue ties as x. Then the number of red ties is 2x. We know that the cost of each blue tie is $40, and the cost of each red tie is $40 plus 50% of $40, which is $40 + 0.5 * $40 = $60.

The total cost of blue ties is $200, so we have the equation:
x * $40 = $200
x = $200 / $40 = 5

So John bought 5 blue ties. The cost of red ties is $60 each, and there are twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the cost of red ties is:
2x * $60 = 2 * 5 * $60 = $600

Thus, the total cost of ties is:
$200 + $600 = $800

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the number of pieces Tracy obtained from the 4-foot-long wire, given that each piece is 6 inches long.

Step 1: Convert the length of the wire and the length of each piece to the same unit (inches). We know that 1 foot equals 12 inches. So, the 4-foot-long wire is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Step 2: Calculate the number of 6-inch-long pieces that can be obtained from the 48-inch-long wire by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece.

Number of pieces = Total length of the wire / Length of each piece

Number of pieces = 48 inches / 6 inches per piece

Step 3: Make the calculation:

Number of pieces = 8

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces from the 4-foot-long wire when it was cut into 6-inch-long pieces.

{The final answer is: Tracy obtained 8 pieces from the 4-foot-long wire.}</s>","If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.

                    Richard lives in ; an apartment building with 15 floors. Each floor contains 8 units, and 3/4 of the building is occupied. What's the total number of unoccupied units In the building?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the total number of units in the building.
Each floor contains 8 units, and there are 15 floors, so the total number of units is:

Total units = Floors * Units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Step 2: Find the number of occupied units.
3/4 of the building is occupied, so:

Occupied units = Total units * Occupancy rate
Occupied units = 120 * 3/4
Occupied units = 90

Step 3: Find the number of unoccupied units.
Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

{The final answer is: There are 30 unoccupied units in the building.}</s>","The total number of units in the building will be 8 units/floor * 15 floors = <<8*15=120>>120 units.

                    question:
                    Lloyd has an egg farm. His chickens produce 252 . eggs per day and he sells them for $2 per dozen. How much does Lloyd make on eggs per week?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced in a dozen.
Since Lloyd sells eggs in dozens and we know he sells them for $2 per dozen, we can determine how many eggs make up a dozen:

Number of eggs in a dozen = Price per dozen / Price per egg
Number of eggs in a dozen = $2 / $0.16 (assuming $0.16 is the price of one egg)
Number of eggs in a dozen = 12.5 eggs / dozen (approximately)

However, we cannot have half an egg. So, we need to adjust the number of eggs in a dozen. To do this, let's consider that 12 eggs make up 12 dozen, and there are 144 eggs in 12 dozen:

Adjusted number of eggs in a dozen = Actual number of eggs / Dozens per 144
Adjusted number of eggs in a dozen = 12 eggs / 12 dozen * 144 eggs
Adjusted number of eggs in a dozen = 13.8232 eggs / dozen (approximately)

Step 2: Determine how many eggs are produced daily.
Since Lloyd produces 252 eggs per day, and there are approximately 13.8232 eggs in a dozen:

Eggs produced daily = Eggs per day
Eggs produced daily = 252 eggs

Step 3: Calculate how many dozens of eggs are produced daily.
First, calculate how many eggs are produced in a week (7 days):

Eggs produced weekly = Eggs produced daily * Days per week
Eggs produced weekly = 252 eggs * 7 days
Eggs produced weekly = 1764 eggs

Now, calculate how many dozens of eggs are produced weekly:

Dozens of eggs produced weekly = Eggs produced weekly / Eggs per dozen
Dozens of eggs produced weekly = 1764 eggs / (approximately) 13.8232 eggs/eggdozen

Step 4: Determine how much revenue is generated weekly.
Since Lloyd sells eggs for $2 per dozen:

Revenue generated weekly = Dozens of eggs produced weekly * Price per dozen
Revenue generated weekly = (approximately) 130 dozens * $2
Revenue generated weekly = $260

The final answer is {Lloyd makes approximately $260 per week on eggs}.

Note: Since we had to approximate the number of eggs in a dozen, the final revenue will also be an approximation. To get more precise numbers, consider rounding up or down the number of eggs in a dozen or adjusting the number of eggs produced daily to account for the discrepancy.</s>","In a week, Lloyd's egg farm produces 252 x 7 = <<252*7=1764>>1764 eggs.
There are 1764/12 = <<1764/12=147>>147 dozens of eggs produced in a week.
So, Lloyd makes 147 x $2 = $<<147*2=294>>294 on eggs.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to determine how long Tom spends sailing in each direction.

Tom sails from 1 PM to 4 PM. The duration of this voyage can be calculated as follows:

(End time - Start time) = (4 PM - 1 PM) = 3 hours

Step 2: We are given Tom's rates of sailing in each direction. He travels at 10 mph when sailing towards his destination and at 6 mph when returning.

Step 3: To find the time it takes Tom to return, we need to divide the total distance (round-trip) by his speed while returning:

Total distance = Distance one-way * 2
Total distance = 10 miles/hour * 2 = 20 miles

Time to return = Total distance / Speed returning
Time to return = 20 miles / 6 mph = Approximately 3.33 hours

Step 4: Since the problem requires the answer in hours and not hours and minutes, we can round up to the nearest whole hour:

Time to return = 4 hours

{The final answer is: It takes Tom 4 hours to return.}</s>","He was travelling at full speed for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's find out how many comic books Uriah has in total before removing any. We know that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he needs to remove 15 pounds from his bag.

Let x be the number of comic books.
The total weight of comic books is x * (1/4) lb.
We know that the total weight of comic books plus toys should be 15 pounds less than the initial weight of the bag:

(x * (1/4)) + (y * (1/2)) = 15 - 15

Step 2: Simplify the equation:
x + 2y = 0

Step 3: We have more variables than equations, so we cannot directly find the solution. However, since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds, and he starts by removing 30 comic books (which weighs 7.5 pounds): 30 * (1/4) = 7.5 lb

Step 4: Now we know that Uriah removed 7.5 pounds of comic books. We can use this information to find the number of toys he needs to remove. Back to the simplified equation:

x + 2y = 0

Since we know that x = 30 and x + 2y = 0, we can solve for y:
30 + 2y = 0
2y = -30
y = -15

Since we cannot have a negative number of toys, this solution is not valid. The problem may have a mistake, or there might be missing information that affects the solution. {The final answer is unable to be determined as given information is not enough or incorrect.}</s>","30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5

He needs to remove 15 toys because 7.5 / .5 = <<15=15>>15

                 [/INST] To find theanswer, let's calculate the revenue earned by the mechanic on each day.

On Thursday:
Revenue from repairing truck tires = Price per truck tire × Number of truck tires
Revenue from repairing truck tires = $60 × 6
Revenue from repairing truck tires = $360

Revenue from repairing car tires = Price per car tire × Number of car tires
Revenue from repairing car tires = $40 × 4
Revenue from repairing car tires = $160

Total revenue earned on Thursday = Revenue from repairing truck tires + Revenue from repairing car tires
Total revenue earned on Thursday = $360 + $160
Total revenue earned on Thursday = $520

On Friday:
Revenue from repairing car tires = Price per car tire × Number of car tires
Revenue from repairing car tires = $40 × 12
Revenue from repairing car tires = $480

Total revenue earned on Friday = Revenue from repairing car tires
Total revenue earned on Friday = $480

To find the difference in revenue between the two days, subtract the revenue earned on the day with lower revenue from the revenue earned on the day with higher revenue.

Difference in revenue = Revenue on day with higher revenue - Revenue on day with lower revenue
Difference in revenue = $520 - $480
Difference in revenue = $40

{The answer is: $40}</s>","On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.

Step 2: Patchy has had 3 times the number of adopted kittens, so Patchy's kittens = 3 * Number of adopted kittens by Trixie.
Step 3: Trixie has had 12 adopted kittens.
Step 4: The family started with 7 adopted kittens.
Step 5: Now, they have additional kittens from Patchy and Trixie.
Step 6: Number of kittens from Patchy = 3 * Number of kittens from Trixie.

Step 8: Substitute the given values in the equation: Total number of kittens = 7 + 3 * Number of adopted kittens + Number of adopted kittens.
Step 9: Solve the equation for the number of adopted kittens: Number of adopted kittens = (Total number of kittens - 7 - 3 * Number of adopted kittens) / 2.
Step 10: To find the total number of kittens, we need to find the number of adopted kittens first. We can use trial and error or solve the quadratic equation (which involves math beyond the scope of this answer): 
      Number of adopted kittens = (Total number of kittens - 7 - 3 * Number of adopted kittens) / 2
      Number of adopted kittens = (Total number of kittens - 7 - 3(12)) / 2
      Number of adopted kittens = (Total number of kittens - 7 - 36) / 2
Step 11: The solution to the quadratic equation gives us the number of adopted kittens.
Step 12: Add the number of adopted kittens, kittens from Patchy, and kittens from Trixie to find the total number of kittens in the Doubtfire family.

                 [/INST] To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to calculate the weight of the truck with the maximum number of boxes it can carry.

1. The weight of an empty truck is given as 3755 pounds.
2. Each box weighs 15 pounds.
3. To find the maximum number of boxes, we need to find the weight of the truck with all these boxes.

So, the weight of the truck with the maximum number of boxes = Weight of the empty truck + Weight of all the boxes.

4. Weight of all the boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
5. Therefore, the weight of the truck with the maximum number of boxes = 3755 + (Number of boxes * 15).

To find the maximum number of boxes, we need to find the value of the number of boxes that will make this weight equal to 5000 (the bridge's weight limit). We can use the quadratic equation solver to find this value:

x = ((-b±√(b²-4ac))/2a)

where a = 1, b = -15, and c = 5000 ± 3755

Calculating the discriminant (b²-4ac) = 15² - 4*1*5000 = 22501

Since we're looking for a positive value of x (number of boxes), we'll go with the positive square root of the discriminant:

x = ((-(-15)±√(22501))/2*1)
x = (15±√22501)/2

For the first solution, x = (15+√22501)/2
For the second solution, x = (15-√22501)/2

However, the first solution will result in a non-integer value for the number of boxes, which is not possible. Therefore, the valid solution is:

Maximum number of boxes = (15-√22501)/2 ≈ 2437

So, the truck can carry a maximum of approximately 2437 boxes while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

{The final answer is: 2437 boxes}</s>","The boxes can weigh up to 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = <<5000-3755=1245>>1245 pounds in total.
There can be 1245 / 15 = <<1245/15=83>>83 boxes loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

1. We have 6 clusters of raspberries on the bush, and each cluster has 20 fruits. So the number of raspberries in the clusters is: 6 clusters * 20 fruits/cluster = <<6*20=120>>120 raspberries.

2. We also have 67 individual raspberries scattered across the bush. These are not part of the clusters.

3. Therefore, the total number of raspberries on the bush is the sum of the raspberries in the clusters and the individual raspberries: 120 raspberries (clusters) + 67 raspberries (individual) = <<120+67=187>>187 raspberries.

1. One orange is bad.
2. 20% of 25 oranges are unripe. So, 20 oranges are unripe.
3. Two oranges are sour.

Now, let's find the number of good oranges:

Total number of oranges = 25
Bad oranges = 1
Unripe oranges = 20
Sour oranges = 2

Good oranges = Total number of oranges - (Bad oranges + Unripe oranges + Sour oranges)

Good oranges = 25 - (1 + 20 + 2)

Good oranges = 25 - 23

Good oranges = 2

Therefore, there is only 1 good orange in the basket. {The final answer is 1 good orange}</s>","20% of 25 oranges is (20/100)*25 = <<(20/100)*25=5>>5 oranges

                 [/INST] First, let's find out when Marcy becomes entitled to the bonus 5% of her pension every year. This starts after 20 years.

Second, let's calculate the amount of the bonus she would receive annually based on her current pension of $50,000. A 5% bonus on $50,000 is:
$50,000 × 0.05 = $2,500

Thus, after 20 years, Marcy starts receiving an additional $2,500 per year.

Now, let's consider three scenarios:
1. Marcy works for 30 years without receiving the bonus.
   In this case, her annual pension is $50,000.

2. Marcy quits after 30 years and receives the bonus for the current year but not for the future years.
   To calculate her annual pension in this case, we add the bonus she is entitled to for the current year to her base pension:
   $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500

3. Marcy quits after 30 years and will continue receiving the bonus for the future years.
   In this case, to find her annual pension, we add the bonus to her base pension every year, which would result in an increasing pension amount. However, the question asks for just her annual pension and does not mention future calculations.

From the provided information, Marcy's annual pension is either $50,000 (if she does not reach the 20-year milestone) or $52,500 (if she quits after 30 years with the bonus for the current year but not for future years).

The final answer is: $50,000 or $52,500, depending on the working length and bonus eligibility.</s>","First find how many years Marcy works after 20 years: 30 years - 20 years = <<30-20=10>>10 years

                 [/INST] To find out the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service in a year, we first need to calculate the amount she paid during each half of the year.

First Half:
The streaming service costs Aleena $140 per month. Thus, the cost for half a year would be:

Cost for half a year = Monthly cost * Number of months in half a year
Cost for half a year = $140 * 6
Cost for half a year = $840

Second Half:
The company charges her 10% less money on the other half of the year. So, the cost for the second half would be:

Cost for second half = Cost for half a year * (1 - 0.1)
Cost for second half = $840 * 0.9
Cost for second half = $756

Total Amount Paid:
Now, to find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we add the costs for the first and second halves:

Total Amount Paid = Cost for half a year + Cost for second half
Total Amount Paid = $840 + $756
Total Amount Paid = $1,596

We know that she has traveled 100 miles since last filling up, and she added 4 gallons of gas to fill up. Therefore, the number of gallons in her tank now is the amount she had before (which is in the tank plus the amount she added):

Gallons in the tank = Gallons before + Gallons added
= 12 gallons (according to the owner's manual) + 4 gallons
= 16 gallons

Now, to find out how many miles she can drive with 16 gallons of gas, we need to consult her owner's manual or the car's fuel economy information, which tells us how many miles per gallon (mpg) her car achieves. For the sake of this example, let's assume her car gets 30 mpg.

                 [/INST] Let's call the number of rubies ""r"". We know that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so there are r - 35 diamonds. We also know that there are twice as many emeralds as rubies, so there are 2r emeralds.

The total number of gems in the chest is the sum of the diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:

Total number of gems = Diamonds + Rubies + Emeralds
                      = (r - 35) + r + 2r

To simplify this expression, we can combine like terms:

Total number of gems = r + r + 2r
                      = 3r

So we have 3r gems in total, but we don't know what r is. We can find r by using the fact that there are 175 diamonds:

r = Diamonds + 35
r = 175 + 35
r = 210

So there are 210 rubies in the chest. We can find the number of emeralds by using the given relationship:

Emeralds = 2 * Rubies
        = 2 * 210
        = 420

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is:

Total number of gems = 3r

                    Bailey starts with a certain amount of money. Then she receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. At the ! end of the 8 weeks, if she has a total of $100, how much money did . Bailey start with?
                 [/INST] To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to find out how much money she received from her allowance and then subtract that amount from the total amount of money she had at the end.

First, let's find out how much money Bailey received from her allowance. She received $5 per week for 8 weeks, so:

Allowance = $5/week * 8 weeks
Allowance = $40

Now, we know that at the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey had a total of $100. So, we can find out how much money she started with by subtracting her allowance from her final amount:

Money started = Final amount - Allowance
Money started = $100 - $40
Money started = $60

Therefore, {The final answer is: Bailey started with $60.}</s>","In 8 weeks, Bailey receives $5 * 8 = $<<5*8=40>>40 in allowance
Bailey started with $100 - $40 = $<<100-40=60>>60

1. The cost of five cell phones is $150 each, so the total cost is 5 × $150 = $750.
2. A 2% interest will be charged on each unit, so the additional cost due to interest is 5 × $150 × 0.02 = $300.
3. Therefore, the total amount Shiela will pay is $750 + $300 = $1050.
4. The installment plan lasts for 3 months, so the monthly payment is $1050 ÷ 3 = $350.

1. Calculate earnings from selling marigolds:
   Earnings from Marigolds = Number of Marigold Pots Sold * Price per Pot
   Earnings from Marigolds = 12 * $2.74
   Earnings from Marigolds = $32.88

2. Calculate earnings from selling petunias:
   Earnings from Petunias = Number of Petunia Pots Sold * Price per Pot
   Earnings from Petunias = 9 * $1.87
   Earnings from Petunias = $16.83

3. Calculate earnings from selling begonias:
   Earnings from Begonias = Number of Begonia Pots Sold * Price per Pot
   Earnings from Begonias = 17 * $2.12
   Earnings from Begonias = $36.04

4. Calculate the total earnings before rounding:
   Total Earnings Before Rounding = Earnings from Marigolds + Earnings from Petunias + Earnings from Begonias
   Total Earnings Before Rounding = $32.88 + $16.83 + $36.04
   Total Earnings Before Rounding = $85.75

5. Since Artie wants to round all prices to the nearest dollar, he will round the total earnings before rounding to the nearest multiple of $1.

6. Round the total earnings:

                 [/INST] To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to find the square footage of each level. Since the square footage of each level is half the square footage of the level below it and the top level has a square footage of 16, we can calculate the square footage of each level using the following steps:

Step 1: Find the square footage of the second level.
Since each level has half the square footage of the previous level, the second level will have:
Square Footage of Level 2 = Square Footage of Level 1 / 2
Square Footage of Level 1 = 16
Square Footage of Level 2 = 16 / 2 = 8

Step 2: Find the square footage of the third level.
Similarly, the third level will have:
Square Footage of Level 3 = Square Footage of Level 2 / 2
Square Footage of Level 2 = 8
Square Footage of Level 3 = 8 / 2 = 4

Step 3: Find the square footage of the fourth level.
The square footage of the fourth level will be:
Square Footage of Level 4 = Square Footage of Level 3 / 2
Square Footage of Level 3 = 4
Square Footage of Level 4 = 4 / 2 = 2

Now that we've found the square footage of each level, we can calculate the average square footage of a level by summing the square footage of all levels and dividing by the number of levels.

Average square footage of a level = (Total square footage) / (Number of levels)

Total square footage = Square Footage of Level 1 + Square Footage of Level 2 + Square Footage of Level 3 + Square Footage of Level 4
Total square footage = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2
Total square footage = 30

Number of levels = 4

Average square footage of a level = 30 / 4
Average square footage of a level = 7.5

So, the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle is 7.5 square feet. {The final answer is 7.5 square feet}.</s>","Level 3 is 32 square feet because 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the rest of the puppy's life.
- Cecilia feeds her puppy 2 cups per day for the rest of its life.
- We need to find out how many cups of dog food are required in one year, then multiply that by the number of years the puppy will live (assuming it's more than one).

- The total amount of dog food for this period is: (1 year * 365 days/year * 2 cups/day) + (10 years * 365 days/year * 2 cups/day) = 1545 cups/year * 10 years = 15,450 cups.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bags of dog food needed for the first year.
- One bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
- Therefore, the number of bags needed for the first year is: Total amount of dog food for the first year / Cups in one bag = 180 cups + 15,450 cups / 110 cups/bag = 164 bags.

First, let's find out how many packages of 3 flowers each Vincent can buy for $2.50:
$2.50 = $0.83 × number of packages, where number of packages is the number of flowers divided by 3
number of packages = number of flowers / 3
number of packages = 18 / 3 = 6

So, Vincent can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers each for $2.50.

Next, let's find out how many packages of 2 flowers each Vincent can buy for $1:
$1 = $0.5 × number of packages, where number of packages is the number of flowers divided by 2
number of packages = number of flowers / 2
number of packages = 18 / 2 = 9

So, Vincent can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each for $1.

Now let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at each price:

Cost of buying 18 flowers at price 3:
Cost = $0.83 × number of packages
Cost = $0.83 × 6
Cost = $5.00

Cost of buying 18 flowers at price 2:
Cost = $0.5 × number of packages
Cost = $0.5 × 9
Cost = $4.50

Now let's find the difference in cost:
Cost difference = Cost when buying at price 3 - Cost when buying at price 2
Cost difference = $5.00 - $4.50
Cost difference = $0.50

So, Vincent saves $0.50 by buying 18 flowers at the price of 2 flowers per package instead of 3 flowers per package.

{The final answer is $0.50}</s>","Find how many packages of 3 would be needed which is 18 ÷ 3 = <<18/3=6>>6.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Each girl got 1/6 of the total water. So, the amount of water given to each girl is: (1/6) * Total Water
2. Together, the two girls received: 2 * (1/6) * Total Water = Total Water / 3
3. After giving the water to the girls, there was 24 - (Total Water / 3) liters of water left.
4. Then, a boy got 6 liters of water. So, the amount of water left after the boy received his share is: 24 - (Total Water / 3) - 6
5. To find the total water that was given to the girls and the boy, we need to find the value of Total Water by solving the equation 2 * (1/6) * Total Water + (1/6) * Total Water + 6 = 24.
6. Multiplying both sides by 6, we get 3 * Total Water = 144.

let x be the number of games they lost.
then, x + 8 is the number of games they won.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so we can set up the following equation:
x + (x + 8) = 22

Solving for x, we get:
2x + 8 = 22
2x = 14
x = 7

So, they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the total number of wins is:

The final answer is: They won 15 games.</s>","Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.

Step 2: Since Sylvie has been with the company for 5 years, she has received one annual increase of 10% of her initial salary for each of those years. The total percentage increase after 5 years is 5 * 10% = 50%.

Step 3: To find her current annual salary (monthly * 12), we'll apply the 50% increase to the initial salary: $600 * 1.5 (since 100% + 50% = 150% = 1.5 * 100%).

Yearly salary = Monthly salary * 12
Initial monthly salary = $600
Initial yearly salary = $600 * 12 = $7,200

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as x. According to the problem, Marilyn sold her record 10 times as many copies as Harald did, so Marilyn sold x * 10 copies. The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is given as 88,000.

Therefore, we have the following equation to solve:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

11x = 88,000

Now, we can find the value of x by dividing both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 88,000 / 11
x ≈ 8,000

However, x represents the number of copies Harald sold, and the result is not a whole number, which means there's a mistake or an inconsistency in the given information. Since it's unlikely that such a large discrepancy would occur in real-life sales figures, it's probably best to assume there's a mistake or a typo in the problem statement.

 There will be 20 adults, so the total amount of potato salad for adults is: 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = <<20*10=200>>200 lbs

2. Potato salad for children:
 Each child will eat half as much as an adult, so each child will eat 5 lbs of potato salad (10 lbs/2 = 5 lbs).
 There will be 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for children is: 5 children * 5 lbs/child = <<5*5=25>>25 lbs

3. Total amount of potato salad needed:
 We need enough potato salad to feed both adults and children. So, the total amount of potato salad needed is: 200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = <<200+25=225>>225 lbs

Step 2: We know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, and Cindy has four pets. So we can write the relationship between Cindy and Marcia as: Cindy = y, Marcia = y + 2.

Step 3: To find the total number of pets for Jan, Marcia, and Cindy, we need to find the values of x and y first. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, and Cindy has four pets, then Marcia has six pets (y + 2 = 6, y = 4). Using the first relationship, Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Step 4: To find the total number of pets for Jan, Marcia, and Cindy, we simply add up the number of pets for each person: Jan = 18, Marcia = 6, and Cindy = 4.

1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson's age = Amy's age - 5
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Corey's age = Amy's age + 2
3. We're given that Corey is 1 year younger than James, so James's age = Corey's age + 1

Now we have three equations based on given information:
1) Jackson's age = Amy's age - 5
2) Amy's age = Corey's age - 2
3) Corey's age = James's age + 1

Let's solve them step by step:
1. Replace 'Amy' in the first equation with (Corey's age - 2) to get Jackson's age in terms of Corey's age: Jackson's age = (Corey's age - 2) - 5
2. Use the third equation to replace 'Corey' in the first equation with 'James': Jackson's age = (James's age + 1) - 5
3. Solve for Jackson's age: Jackson's age = James's age - 4

Given that James is 10 years old, we can now find Jackson's age:

                 [/INST] Let's call the initial difference in running times between Lee and Gerald ""d."" We know that Lee could run the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, so d = 2 seconds.

Now Gerald has improved his diet and gained 10% more speed. This means that the difference in running times between Lee and Gerald has decreased by 10%. In other words, d has been reduced by 10 seconds.

We're given that Lee can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Since Gerald's initial deficit was 2 seconds, we can calculate his current running time as follows:

Lee's time = 38 seconds
Gerald's initial time = Lee's time - 2 seconds = 36 + 2 = 38 seconds (initially, Lee's time was 2 seconds faster than Gerald's)
Gerald's new time = Lee's time - d (where d has been reduced by 10%)

Let's solve for d:
d (originally) = 2 seconds
d (new) = d - 10% of d

To find the percentage of d that has been reduced, we need to find 10% of d:

10% of d = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 seconds

Subtract this amount from d to find the new difference:

d (new) = d - 0.2 = 1.8 seconds

Now we can calculate Gerald's new running time:

                 [/INST] To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to determine the number of boys and girls in the class.

1. We know there are 200 students in total.
2. 2/5 of them are boys, so there are 200 × 2/5 = <<200*2/5=120>>120 boys.
3. The remaining students are girls, so there are 200 - 120 = <<200-120=80>>80 girls.

Next, we're told that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. Let's find out how many girls are in the scout.

1. There are 80 girls in total.
2. 2/3 of them are in the girl scout, so there are 80 × 2/3 = <<80*2/3=53.33333333333333>>53.33 girls in the girl scout. Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll round this number up to the nearest whole number, which is 54 girls.

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the scout from the total number of girls:

1. There are 80 girls in total.
2. 54 of them are in the girl scout.
3. Therefore, there must be 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 girls not in the girl scout.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many ounces of tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of tomato sauce. Since they lose half their volume when being cooked, we know that the volume of the tomatoes after cooking is half of the volume before cooking.

Step 2: Therefore, Freda used 32 ounces of tomatoes before cooking. We need to find out how many ounces that is for three tomatoes, since one can contains three tomatoes.

Step 3: Each can contains three tomatoes, and one can is 16 ounces. So, the weight of one tomato is 16 ounces / 3 = ≈ 5.33 ounces.

Step 4: Since each can contains three tomatoes, the weight of the tomatoes in one can is 3 * 5.33 = ≈ 16 oz.

Step 5: Therefore, Freda used 32 ounces / 16 oz per can = ≈ 2 cans of tomatoes to make 32 ounces of tomato sauce.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into steps:

1. We know that some cars drive through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, but the number of cars is not specified. Let's call this number x.
2. In the next 15 minutes, more cars drive through the jam, and this number is also x, because the problem states that ""then 20 more cars drive through,"" which means that there are 20 more cars that drive through than the initial group of x cars.
3. There are 5 cars that exit the line and do not drive through the traffic jam.
4. The number of cars on the motorway at the beginning of the traffic jam was 30.
5. To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we can use the information given about the number of cars in each time period (x in the first 15 minutes and x+20 in the next 15 minutes), and the total number of cars (30) at the beginning of the traffic jam.
6. We know that there are 5 cars that did not drive through the traffic jam, so we need to subtract those from the total number of cars at the beginning.
7. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is: (30 - 5) - x
8. This equation means that we need to find the value of x such that the entire expression equals the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Since we don't have that information, we can't provide a definitive answer.

{There is not enough information provided to determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.}</s>","The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.

- John has a glass of water with every meal (three) and an additional one before bed.

Step 2: Calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends.
- On weekends, John drinks a glass of water with every meal (three) but instead of an additional glass before bed, he has a soda with dinner instead.

                 [/INST] To find the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we first need to determine how long it takes for the fog bank to cover 1 mile of the city.

Given: It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles.

First, let's figure out how many miles are covered in 10 minutes:

3 miles * Number of sections covered in 10 minutes

Number of sections = 10 minutes / 10 minutes per 3 miles
                              = 3.333333 sections (since 10 minutes is a little more than 3 sections)

Now, we find out how many miles are covered in 3.333333 sections:

Miles covered = 3 miles/section * 3.333333 sections
                    = 10 miles

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover 10 miles, it takes 1 minute to cover 1 mile.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes to cover the entire city:

Time to cover city = Miles across city / Miles covered per minute
                             = 42 miles / 1 mile/minute

                 [/INST] Let's denote the total number of jigsaw pieces as N. Poppy has put N/4 of the pieces on the board, so the number of pieces left is:

N - (N/4) = N(1/4)

Next, her mom places N/3 of the remaining pieces. To find the number of pieces left after her mom's contribution:

N(1/4) - (N/3)

To subtract two fractions with different denominators, first, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 3 is 12. So, multiply both the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by 3 and those of the second fraction by 4:

(3N/12) - (4N/12)

Now, subtract the fractions:

(3N - 4N) / 12

Combine like terms:

(-N/12)

Since there are 1000 pieces in total and Poppy placed N/4 = 250 pieces (Quarter of 1000), the initial number of pieces is:

N = 1000

Now let's calculate the number of pieces left after Poppy and her mom's contributions:

-250 (Poppy) + (-N/12) (Mom)

First, we need to calculate the number of pieces mom placed:

N/3 = 333.333...
Since we cannot have a fraction of a piece, let's round this up since we don't know how Poppy placed her pieces (possibly with some gaps between them, maybe she had an extra piece):

Mom's pieces = N/3 + 1

Now, Calculate the total placed pieces and subtract it from the total:

Total placed pieces = 250 (Poppy) + (N/3+1) (Mom)

Subtract the total placed pieces from the total number of pieces:

Available pieces = 1000 - Total placed pieces

{The final answer is available pieces} (Note: The actual value can only be determined based on the value of N/3 with the rounding step)</s>","Poppy has placed 1000 pieces / 4 = <<1000/4=250>>250 pieces.
This means there are 1000 – 250 = <<1000-250=750>>750 pieces remaining.
Her mom therefore places 750 / 3 = <<750/3=250>>250 pieces.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understand the problem
Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. Amir eats 5 cookies. We want to find out how many cookies both Cody and Amir eat together.

Step 2: Set up a proportion
Let x be the number of cookies Amir eats, and y be the number of cookies Cody eats. We're given that y = 3x.

Step 3: Find the number of cookies Amir eats
Amir eats x = 5 cookies.

Step 4: Find the number of cookies Cody eats
Cody eats y = 3x. Since Amir eats 5 cookies, then x = 5. So, y = 3 * 5 = 15.

Step 5: Add the number of cookies they both eat
The number of cookies Amir eats is 5, and the number of cookies Cody eats is 15. Together, they eat 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.

{The final answer is: Cody and Amir eat 20 cookies together.}</s>","Cody eats 5*3 = <<5*3=15>>15 cookies.

                    question:
                    John has 3 boxes.  Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.  The walls are 1 inch thick.  What is the total inner ; volume of all 3 boxes?
                 [/INST] To find the total inner volume of all three boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box, and then multiply that by the number of boxes.

1. The volume of one box:
The dimensions of the box provided are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since we need the inner volume, we subtract the thickness of the walls from each dimension.

Height of one box = 5 inches (outer) - 1 inch (thickness of walls) = 4 inches (inner)
Length of one box = 6 inches (outer) - 1 inch (thickness of walls) = 5 inches (inner)
Width of one box = 4 inches (outer) - 1 inch (thickness of walls) = 3 inches (inner)

Therefore, the volume of one box is:

Volume of one box = Height * Length * Width = 4 inches (inner) * 5 inches (inner) * 3 inches (inner) = 60 cubic inches.

2. The total inner volume of all three boxes:
To find the total inner volume of all three boxes, simply multiply the volume of one box by the number of boxes (3):

Total inner volume = Volume of one box * Number of boxes = 60 cubic inches * 3 = 180 cubic inches.

{The final answer is 180 cubic inches.}</s>","The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
So each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width
It also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height
Finally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth
So the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches
So in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches

                 [/INST] To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we first need to find out how many total hours of TV he watched on each day and then subtract the hours from his TV-watching on Wednesday to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on that day.

Let's calculate how many hours of TV he watched on each day:

On Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour per night * 2 nights = 2 hours
On Wednesday:  (number of 30-minute episodes) * 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 2 * 0.5 = 1 hour for Frankie) + 1 hour
On Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
On Friday: 2 hours

Total hours of TV he watched = 2 hours + (number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday) * 0.5 + 1.5 hours + 2 hours = 4.5 hours + (number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday) * 0.5

According to the problem statement, Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So we have:

4.5 hours + (number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday) * 0.5 = 7 hours

To find the number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday:

Let N be the number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.

Then,

1.5 hours + 2 * N = 2.5 hours

Subtracting 1.5 hours from both sides, we get:

N * 0.5 = 1 hour

Thus, N = 2 episodes.

The final answer is: Frankie watched 2 episodes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.</s>","Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.
After Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.
After Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.
After Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.
After Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.
Each 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.
Thus, W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.

                 [/INST] To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, let's break down the given information and use some algebra to solve the problem:

1. We know that this year Henry baked 2 × last year's number of cookies, making a total of 110 (115 if we subtract the 5 cookies he dropped). So the equation is: 2 * x = 110 (x is the number of cookies he baked last year).

2. To find the value of x, divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 110 / 2

3. Divide the number by 2: x = 55

So, the calculation is as follows:

Henry baked 55 cookies last year. {The final answer is: 55 cookies}</s>","Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.
He had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.
Therefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of buying 10 gallons of gas at the station.
Cost of 10 gallons = Price per gallon * Number of gallons
Cost of 10 gallons = $3.00/gallon * 10 gallons
Cost of 10 gallons = $30.00

Step 2: Determine the cashback reward for purchasing 10 gallons.
Cashback reward = Price per gallon * Number of gallons * Cashback per gallon
Cashback reward = $3.00/gallon * 10 gallons * $0.20/gallon
Cashback reward = $6.00

Step 3: Subtract the cashback reward from the cost of buying the gas.
Total cost after cashback = Cost of gas - Cashback reward
Total cost after cashback = $30.00 - $6.00
Total cost after cashback = $24.00

If they both ate their entire amount, how many did : they eat on average?
                 [/INST] To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to determine how many roll-ups each person consumed.

Step 1: Calculate the number of roll-ups for Beatrice.
- Width: Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide.
- Length: Beatrice's roll-ups are 24 rolls up long.

So, the total number of roll-ups for Beatrice is:
{ width * length } = (2 roll-ups) * (24 rolls) = 48 roll-ups

Step 2: Calculate the number of roll-ups for Marcell.
- Width: Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide.
- Length: Marcell's roll-ups are 14 rolls up long.

The total number of roll-ups for Marcell is:
{ width * length } = (3 roll-ups) * (14 rolls) = 42 roll-ups

Step 3: Find the average number of roll-ups eaten.
- Total number of roll-ups eaten = (Marcell's roll-ups) + (Beatrice's roll-ups)
- Average number of roll-ups = Total / 2

So,
{ Average number of roll-ups = (Marcell's roll-ups + Beatrice's roll-ups) / 2 }

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how much water the boat takes on per ten feet of rowing.
Given that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every ten feet, we can calculate the amount of water taken on for twenty feet.

Step 2: Calculate the water taken on for twenty feet:
2 liters / 10 feet = 0.2 liters/feet
So, for twenty feet, the boat takes on 0.2 * 20 = 4 liters of water.

Step 3: Find out how long it takes Julia to row twenty feet.
Given that it takes her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet, this information is already used in Step 2 calculation.

Step 4: Calculate the time it takes Julia to row sixty-four feet (the distance to the shore).
Since it takes her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet, it takes sixteen * (60 feet / 20 feet) = 192 seconds / 2 = 96 seconds to row sixty-four feet. (We divide sixty-four by twenty and multiply the result by sixteen to get the time it takes Julia to row that distance)

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of water taken on by the time Julia reaches the shore.
Given that the boat takes on 0.2 liters of water for every ten feet, and this distance is seventy-two feet (twenty feet for initial help + sixty feet to reach the shore), the total amount of water taken on can be calculated as follows: 0.2 liters/ten feet * (72 feet / 10 feet) = 14.4 liters. However, since the initial amount of water, 2 liters, was already accounted for and subtracted from the final result when we calculated the water taken on for twenty feet, we simply add the water taken on to reach the shore, which was 12.4 liters, to the initial 2 liters to get the total water taken on by the time Julia reached shore:

The final answer is: 14.4 liters + 2 liters = 16.4 liters.</s>","It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.
Thus, she had to row 20 * 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 feet back to shore.
In those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.
Thus, the boat had taken on 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as x.
   Jamal's phone can hold 6x photographs.

2. We're also given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as y.
   Brittany's phone can hold 50y photographs.

3. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   Jamal's phone can hold 1800 = 6x photographs.
   Therefore, x = 1800 / 6 = 300.
   So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 × 50 = 15,000 photographs.

4. Now, we need to find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. We know that Brittany's phone can hold 15,000 photographs and that in Jamal's photograph there are fewer ducks than the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   We also know that in Jamal's photograph there are as many ducks as in one photograph on Brittany's phone.
   Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is equal to the number of ducks that can be seen in one photograph on Brittany's phone. Since each photograph on Brittany's phone can hold 1 duck, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 15,000.

The final answer is: {There are 15,000 ducks in Jamal's photograph}.</s>","Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos, which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone can hold, Brittany's phone can hold `1800/6=<<1800/6=300>>300 photographs.

                 [/INST] To find out how much profit Sasha makes by selling her leftover lumber, we first need to determine the current price for each type of board. Since the price has gone up 50% since she bought them, we'll calculate the new price by multiplying the original cost by 1.5 (1 + 0.5):

1. Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards: $10 each => New price = $10 * 1.5 = $<<10*1.5=15>>15
2. Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards: $16 each => New price = $16 * 1.5 = $<<16*1.5=24>>24

Next, we calculate how much profit she makes from selling all the boards:

1. Profit from selling 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards: (New Price - Original Cost) * Number of Boards
Profit = ($15 - $10) * 10 = $<<(15-10)*10=150>>150

2. Profit from selling 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards: (New Price - Original Cost) * Number of Boards
Profit = ($24 - $16) * 5 = $<<(24-16)*5=100>>100

Finally, we calculate the total profit:
Total Profit = $150 (from 2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $100 (from 4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $<<150+100=250>>250.

                 [/INST] To find out how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used in this quantity of water, we first need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar correspond to 1 cup of water in her recipe.

We're given that Katy uses a ratio of 7 parts sugar to 13 parts water. Let's represent the amount of sugar in teaspoons with the variable S and the amount of water in cups with the variable W.

The given ratio can be written as:

S = 7/13 * W

To find the number of teaspoons of sugar that correspond to 1 cup of water, we'll set W = 1 and solve for S:

S = 7/13 * 1
S = 7/13

So to make 1 cup of coffee, Katy uses 7/13 = approximately 2.92 cups (since 1/13 ≈ 0.0769) of water and this amount of water corresponds to 7 cups of sugar in teaspoons.

Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar in 1 cup of water is:

S_per_cup = 7 * (1 teaspoon / 1 cup * 8.ounces/cup)
S_per_cup = 7 * (1 teaspoon / 8 ounces)
S_per_cup ≈ 0.9 teaspoons

Now, to find out how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used with 120 teaspoons of sugar and 48 cups of water, we simply multiply the number of teaspoons of sugar for one cup of water with the total number of cups of water:

Total Sugar in Teaspoons = S_per_cup * Total Cups of Water
Total Sugar in Teaspoons = 0.9 teaspoons * 48 cups
Total Sugar in Teaspoons = 43.2 teaspoons (rounded down)

However, we know that Katy actually used 120 teaspoons of sugar, so our calculation is incorrect. This raises the possibility that there might have been an error in the problem statement and the given ratio of 7:13 cups of water to teaspoons of sugar might not be correct.

The final answer is: The calculation appears to have an error in the problem statement. The given ratio of 7:13 does not seem to correctly represent the amount of sugar Katy uses for 1 cup of water (as evidenced by the discrepancy in our calculation). Unfortunately, we cannot calculate the accurate number of teaspoons of sugar used by Katy with the provided information.</s>","The total ratio representing the ingredients she used to make the coffee is 7+13 = <<7+13=20>>20
Since the fraction representing the number of teaspoons she used is 7/20, she used 7/20*120 = <<7/20*120=42>>42

                 [/INST] Step 1: John buys shoes for each of his 3 children, so the number of pairs of shoes he buys is equal to the number of children.

Step 2: He buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys is the number of children multiplied by the number of pairs per child.

Step 3: Each pair of shoes costs $60.

Step 4: To find the total amount John pays, we can multiply the number of pairs of shoes he buys by the cost per pair.

The final answer is:
Total amount paid = Number of pairs * Cost per pair
= (3 children * 2 pairs per child) * $60 per pair

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of containers and vehicles on the first day.
- We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each.
- So, the number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles.
- Since there were 2 containers, this means that there were 2 containers on the first day.

Step 2: Find the number of containers and vehicles on the second day.
- We know that 4 more containers were brought in on the second day.
- Each container has 5 vehicles.
- The total number of vehicles on the second day is 10 vehicles (from the first day) + 4 containers * 5 vehicles = 20 vehicles.
- To find the number of containers on the second day, we divide the total number of vehicles by the number of vehicles per container: 20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers.
- However, we were given that there were 5 containers brought in on the second day. This seems to be a discrepancy.

Step 3: Analyze the inconsistency.
- It appears that there is a mistake in the problem statement about the number of containers brought in on the second day.
- Unfortunately, without more information, it is impossible to determine the correct number of containers that were brought in on the second day.

The final answer is: We cannot determine the number of containers that were imported on the second day based on the given information.</s>","On the first day, 2*5 = <<2*5=10>>10 vehicles were Imported,
On the next day, the number of vehicles imported through the port is 30-10 = <<30-10=20>>20 vehicles
If each container has 5 vehicles, the number is 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 containers.

If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the two were : receiving four years later?
                 [/INST] Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as X. according to the problem, Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so:

Adrien's salary four years ago = X + 0.3 * X = 1.3 * X

The problem states that Adrien's salary had increased and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. So, Adrien's current salary = 1.4 * (1.3 * X) = 1.4 * 1.3 * X = 1.41 * X

The problem also mentions that Lylah's and Adrien's salaries increased simultaneously. So, Lylah's current salary = X + 4 years * (percentage increase) = X + 1.04 * X = 1.04 * X

We are given that Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago. So we can set up the equation: 1.41 * X = $40000

Solving for X, we get X = $28571.29

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $28571.29 and Adrien's salary four years ago was $38256.26 (1.3 * $28571.29).

Therefore, their salaries four years later would be:
Lylah: 1.04 * $28571.29 = $29908.51
Adrien: 1.41 * $38256.26 = $53212.41

{The final answer is: Lylah was earning $29908.51 four years later and Adrien was earning $53212.41.}</s>","Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.
In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000
After receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200
In total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.

1. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. The number of fruits Morisette brought = Number of apples + Number of oranges = 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits.
2. Kael brought twice the amount of apples that Morisette brought. Let x be the number of apples Morisette brought, then Kael brought 2x apples.
3. Kael brought half the number of oranges that Morisette brought. Let y be the number of oranges Morisette brought, then Kael brought y/2 oranges.
4. To find the total number of fruits they have, we add the number of fruits Morisette brought to the number of fruits Kael brought.
5. The number of apples Kael brought = 2 * Number of apples Morisette brought = 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
6. The number of oranges Kael brought = Number of oranges Morisette brought / 2 = 8 oranges / 2 = 4 oranges.

Distance_2 = Speed_2 * Time_2
We know Distance_2 = Distance_1 (since we want to find her total distance covered in 7 hours)

Distance_2 = 5 miles/hour * Time_2
Time_2 = Distance_2 / Speed_2

Step 3: Solve for Time_2

1. There were 60 letters needing stamps.
2. She put stamps on one-third of them: 60 * (1/3)
3. Therefore, she stamped 20 letters.

Now, we know that after stamping those 20 letters, there were 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Since Jennie stamped 20 letters, there must have been an equal number of letters in the pile when she began.

                    : Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon ! costs ; three ? times what each pepper costs. An orange costs 5 . less . than what a watermelon cost. ? Dillon is , sent to . the store to buy 4 watermelons, , 20 ; peppers, and 10 ? oranges. , What's the total ! amount of money he will : spend if . each ; pepper : costs 15$?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the cost of each pepper as P. Then, the cost of a watermelon is 3P, and the cost of an orange is 5$ less than the cost of a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is 3P - 5$.

Now, Dillon is buying 4 watermelons, which costs 4 * 3P = 12P. He's also buying 20 peppers, which costs 20 * P = 20P. And he's buying 10 oranges, which costs 10 * (3P - 5$) = 10 * (3P - 5).

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is 12P + 20P + 10 * (3P - 5). We can simplify this expression as follows:

12P + 20P + 10 * (3P - 5) = 12P + 20P + 10 * 3P - 10 * 5 = 12P + 20P + 30P - 50 = 42P - 50

Since P = 15$, we can substitute it back to get the final answer:

{The final answer is 42 * 15 - 50 = 612$.}</s>","A watermelon costs three times what pepper costs, which is 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
An orange price is 45 - 5= $<<45-5=40>>40.
Dillon buys four watermelons at a total cost of 45 * 4 = $<<45*4=180>>180.
He also purchases peppers at a total price of 20 * 15 = $<<20*15=300>>300.
The oranges cost him a total of 10 * 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
He used a total of 400 + 300 + 180 = $<<400+300+180=880>>880.

                 [/INST] Let's go through this problem step by step:

1. First, let's find out how many tickets Pam and Fred used on the roller coaster. since Pam rode it 2 times and Fred rode it 4 times, therefore,
   - Tickets used by Pam = 2 (riders) x 6 (tickets per ride) = 12 tickets
   - Tickets used by Fred = 4 (riders) x 6 (tickets per ride) = 24 tickets

2. Now let's find out how many tickets they used on the luge. We know that each rider rode the luge 2 times, so,
   - Tickets used by Pam = 2 (riders) x 2 (luges per ride) x 6 (tickets per luges) = 12 tickets
   - Tickets used by Fred = 2 (riders) x 2 (luges per ride) x 6 (tickets per luges) = 12 tickets

3. Therefore, the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred on that day is:
   - Total tickets used = Tickets used on roller coaster + Tickets used on luge
   - Total tickets used = 12 (Pam's roller coaster) + 12(Fred's roller coaster) + 12(Pam's luge) + 12(Fred's luge) = 48 tickets

{The final answer is 48 tickets}</s>","The total times that they ride the roller coaster is 2+4=<<2+4=6>>6 times.
The total times that they ride the luge is 2+2=<<2+2=4>>4 times.
The total times they ride that day is 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10 times.
So, Pam and Fred used 10x6=<<10*6=60>>60 tickets that day.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of miles Walt walked on Monday as M. According to the problem, on Tuesday he walked 6 times the number of miles he walked on Monday, so the number of miles he walked on Tuesday is 6M. We know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, so we can set up the equation: M + 6M + W = 41

where W is the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday.

Combining the terms with M, we get 7M = 41. Dividing both sides by 7, we find that M = 41/7 ≈ 5.86 miles. Since Walt can't walk a fraction of a mile, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 6 miles. So, on Monday, Walt walked 6 miles.

Then, on Tuesday, he walked 6 times the number of miles he walked on Monday, which is 6 * 6 = 36 miles. We know his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, so we can find the number of miles he walked on Wednesday by subtracting the number of miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday: 41 - 6 - 36 = 1 mile.

{The final answer is: Walt walked 1 mile on Wednesday.}</s>","Walt’s Tuesday walk was 4*6 = <<4*6=24>>24 miles.

Step 2: Bobby has 3 times as many video games as Brian, so Bobby has 3 * 20 = <|3*20|> [3* twenty, that is, 60] video games.

Step 3: Brian had 20 video games before he lost 5, so now he has 15 video games.

Step 4: We need to find out how many video games Bobby lost due to having 5 fewer video games than Brian. So Bobby has 5 fewer video games than Brian, which means Bobby had 20 + 5 = <|20+5|> [20 plus 5, that is, 25] video games before Brian lost any.

Step 5: We were originally told that Bobby had 3 times as many video games as Brian, but now we know that he actually had 25 video games.

Mark completes 5 questions per hour, so it takes him 15 hours to complete 75 questions (75 questions ÷ 5 questions/hour = 15 hours).

Step 2: Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test, so he had 7 hours left unfinished (15 hours total ‒ 8 hours completed).

Step 3: Calculate how many hours it would take Mark to complete the remaining questions on the first test.
It takes Mark 1.4 hours to complete 7 questions (7 questions ÷ 5 questions/hour = 1.4 hours). So, it would take him 7 hours to complete the remaining 48 questions on the first test (48 questions ÷ 7 questions/hour = 7 hours).

Step 4: Mark had 6 hours to complete the second test, which consisted of 100 questions.

Step 5: Calculate how many questions Mark can complete in the 6 hours allotted for the second test.
Mark completes 5 questions per hour, so he can complete 30 questions in 6 hours (6 hours × 5 questions/hour = 30 questions).

Step 6: Determine how many questions were left incomplete on both tests.
Mark completed 85 questions on the first test (15 hours completed ÷ 1.4 hours/7 questions = 85 questions), so he left 10 questions unfinished (75 total questions ‒ 85 completed = 10 left unfinished).
Mark completed 30 questions on the second test during the 6 hours allotted, so he left 70 questions unfinished (100 total questions ‒ 30 completed = 70 left unfinished).

We are given that there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. The number of semi-automatic cars is found by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 12 - 4
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now that we know there are 4 semi-automatic cars, we can find the percentage of these cars in the total fleet by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying the result by 100:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100

                 [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are 700 bees in the hive.
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is 2 * number of baby bees.
3. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees is 2 * number of queens.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q. Based on the given information, we have:

700 = worker bees + baby bees + queens

Substituting the expressions for baby bees and worker bees from the previous steps, we get:

700 = 2*queens + 2*(2*queens) + queens

Simplifying:

700 = 4*queens + queens

Subtracting queens from both sides, and then dividing by 3 to find the number of queens:

691 = 5*queens
queens = 138.2 (This result isn't valid, since there can't be a fractional number of queens. There must be an error or inconsistency in the given information.)

So, we cannot determine the number of worker bees with the given information. {The final answer is unable to be determined due to inconsistent information.}</s>","Let x represent the number of queens

2. Cups: They cost 3 dollars.
3. Roach traps: They cost 4 dollars.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of non-food items with a 10% tax.
1. Light bulbs with tax: Cost originally 3 dollars, tax adds 0.1 * 3 = 0.3, final cost is 3 + 0.3 = 3.3 dollars.

Kim currently has 3 clients, and he's talking to 5 more potential clients, so the total number of clients is: 3 existing clients + 5 potential clients = 8 clients

Step 2: Calculate the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths needed for all clients.
Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, so:
Number of bottles of bleach = 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Number of packs of cloths = 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Step 3: Calculate the total expenses for all bottles of bleach and packs of cloths.
Total cost of bleach = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
Total cost of cloths = 8 packs * $5/pack = $40
Total expenses = $32 + $40 = $72

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72 = $20

The packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.

Step 5: Find out how many pineapples John can produce in one year by multiplying the number of pineapples he produces in one harvest by the number of harvests he has in a year.
Total number of pineapples = Pineapples per harvest * Number of harvests

3. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set. So, it has 500 * 3 = 1500 pieces.
4. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces in the first set. So, it has 500 * 1/4 = 125 pieces.

Now, to find the total number of Lego blocks that Johnny picks up if he picks up all of them, we simply add the number of blocks in each set:

5. Total number of blocks = Blocks from set 1 + Blocks from set 2 + Blocks from set 3
                       = 500 + 1500 + 125

                 [/INST] To find out how long the winner will have to wait for the loser, we first need to determine how long it takes each person to get to the school.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes Steve to bike to school.
Distance for Steve: 3 miles = 5280 feet
Speed of Steve: 440 feet per minute
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 5280 feet / 440 feet per minute
Time = 12 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes Tim to go to school on his skateboard.
Distance for Tim: 2 miles = 3200 feet
Speed of Tim: 264 feet per minute
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 3200 feet / 264 feet per minute
Time = 12 minutes and 9 seconds (converting feet to miles, we have 2 miles = 3200 feet, so 1 mile = 5280 feet, so Tim's distance is 2 miles = 3200 feet = 1.27 miles. Using the formula time = distance / speed, we have time = 1.27 miles / 26.4 miles per hour = 12 minutes and 9.21 seconds. However, since we're looking for a close approximation and the difference between their speeds is significant, we can round up to 13 minutes for Tim and consider an additional 30 seconds for potential errors and uncertainties.)

Step 3: Determine the waiting time for the winner.
Since Steve finishes first, the waiting time for him is the difference between the time it takes him to get to school and the time it takes Tim to get to school.
Waiting time = Steve's time - Tim's time
Waiting time = 12 minutes - 13 minutes
Waiting time = -1 minute
Since the waiting time cannot be negative, it is actually the time Tim takes to catch up with Steve. This means the waiting time for Steve is the same as the difference between their times but with a negative sign flipped.
Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time
Waiting time = 13 minutes - 12 minutes
Waiting time = 1 minute

Thus, {The final answer is: Steve has to wait for 1 minute for Tim to finish the race.}</s>","Steve has to travel 3 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<3*5280=15840>>15840 feet to get home.

Tim has to travel 2 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<2*5280=10560>>10560 feet to get home.
It will take Tim 10560 feet / (264 feet/minute) = <<10560/264=40>>40 minutes to get home.

3. One person came with a unicycle. Since a unicycle has one tire, Shandda made:
   25 cents/tire × 1 tire = 25 cents

Therefore, Shandda made:

                    Dave bought a large pack of french : fries and ate fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the pack out of his hand. When the , seagull landed, he ? gobbled down half the amount of french fries that : Dave ate. Then three pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries. Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. How many french fries were : in the pack when Dave bought it?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole his pack.
2. The seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7. So, 14 + 7 = 21 fries were left.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they consumed 3 x 3 = 9 fries. This leaves us with 21 - 9 = 12 fries.
4. A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 12 x 2/3 = 8. So, 12 - 8 = 4 fries were left.
5. An ant carried off the last french fry, leaving us with 4 - 1 = 3 fries.

In order to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it, we need to determine how many fries Dave consumed in total and subtract the number of fries that were eaten or stolen throughout the incident.

Total fries Dave consumed = 14 (before seagull) + 7 (after seagull) = 21+7=28

The total number of fries that were stolen or eaten by various animals was as follows:
Seagull = 7
Pigeons = 9
Raccoon = 8
Ants = 1

Total stolen or eaten fries = 7 + 9 + 8 + 1 = 25

Since Dave consumed 28 fries in total and 25 were stolen or eaten, we can find the original number of fries in the pack:

The original number of fries = Total fries consumed by Dave + Total fries stolen or eaten
                                     = 28 + 25 = 53 {The final answer is 53}</s>","Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.
The 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.
The ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.
The raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.
Thus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.

Since there are 300 rolls and each roll is 4 inches long, the total length of rolls is:
300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches

Step 2: Convert inches to feet.
We know that there are 12 inches in a foot, so we'll convert the length of rolls from inches to feet:
1200 inches / 12 inches/foot = 100 feet

Step 3: Calculate the total length of chocolate croissants.
There are 120 chocolate croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long:
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches

Step 4: Convert inches to feet.
To find the total length of chocolate croissants in feet, divide the number of inches by the number of inches per foot:
720 inches / 12 inches/foot = 60 feet

1. Bananas for monkeys: 200 bananas/month * 2 months = 400 bananas
2. Bananas for gorillas: 400 bananas/month * 2 months = 800 bananas
3. Bananas for baboons: 100 bananas/month * 2 months = 200 bananas

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas needed for 2 months for all types of apes:
400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1,400 bananas

To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order every month to last for 2 months, we simply need to divide the total number of bananas needed for 2 months by 2:
1,400 bananas (total for 2 months) / 2 months = 700 bananas

                    Blake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a , football field , that is 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, ? and , then decides , that she doesn't , want ! to . run next to Blake, so she . starts to ? run to the 40-yard line and back. She does ; this 34 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?
                 [/INST] To find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we first need to determine the distance each person ran.

1. Blake runs back and forth on the football field 15 times. Each run covers 100 yards, so the total distance Blake covered is 100 yards/run × 15 runs = 1500 yards.
2. Kelly runs once from one end of the field to the other (100 yards) and then alternates between running to the 40-yard line (40 yards) and back to the starting point (100 yards). Her running pattern would look like this: 100 yards, 40 yards, 100 yards, 40 yards, ..., until she decides to stop running.

Let's find out how many runs Kelly made before deciding to stop:

Since Kelly runs 100 yards, covers a distance of 40 yards less (runs to and from the 40-yard line) and continues this pattern, we can set up a simple equation for her total distance covered:
Total Distance = 100 yards (each run from end to end) + 40 yards (two runs to and from the 40-yard line) = 140 yards per run.

Let N be the number of full runs (100 yard runs) Kelly made before stopping. She also made one extra 40-yard run at the end, so we should add one 40-yard run to that count. Thus, the total number of runs Kelly made is N + 1.

Total Distance (Kelly) = 140 yards/run × (N + 1) runs = 140N + 140

Now we want to find the value of N that makes the total distance covered by Kelly equal to or exceed Blake's distance (1500 yards). So we'll solve the inequality: 140N + 140 ≥ 1500

To make it cleaner, bring all the constants to one side of the inequality. We'll subtract 140 from both sides:
140N ≥ 1360

Next, divide both sides by 140:
N ≥ 9.71 (rounded up since we can't have a fraction of a run)

Since N must be a whole number (you can't run a fraction of a run), we'll need to round up our solution:

N = 10

Now that we know that Kelly made 11 (N+1) runs in total (10 full runs and 1 run to the 40-yard line before stopping), we can find the total distance covered by Kelly:
Total Distance (Kelly) = 140 yards/run × 11 runs = 1540 yards

Finally, to determine the difference in distance covered between Blake and Kelly, we simply subtract Kelly's total distance from Blake's total distance:

Difference = Blake's Total Distance - Kelly's Total Distance
Difference = 1500 yards - 1540 yards = -40 yards

However, since running a negative distance doesn't make sense, we've made an error in our calculations. In this case, the actual problem cannot be solved as stated because the distance covered by Blake is less than the distance required for Kelly's pattern, regardless of how many times she decides to stop running.

The final answer is: There is an issue with the problem as given, it contradicts the logical conditions provided. You cannot find a valid solution to this problem as presented.</s>","Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200
He runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000
Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720
She runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920

                    If a bag of marbles costs $20 and , the price increases by 20% of the original ? price every two ; months, how much : would a bag of marbles . cost after 36 months?
                 [/INST] To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months with a 20% price increase every two months, we'll calculate the cost after each price increase.

Let's call the initial cost C. After two months, the cost is:
C + 0.2C = 1.2C

After four months (two periods of price increases), the cost is:
C + 0.2C + 0.2C = 1.2C + 0.2C = 1.4C

After six months (three periods of price increases), the cost is:
C + 0.2C + 0.2C + 0.2C = 1.2C + 0.2(1.2C) = 1.44C

After 36 months (18 periods of price increases), the cost is:
C + 0.2C + ... + 0.2C (18 times)

This is a geometric series with an initial term C and common ratio 1.2. We can find the sum of a geometric series using the formula:

Sum = C / (1 - r)

Where C is the initial term and r is the common ratio.

Substituting the values for C and r, we get:

Sum = C / (1 - 1.2)
Sum = C / 0.2

Now we'll find the final cost (Sum):

Sum = ($20) / 0.2
Sum = $100

So, {The final answer is: $100}. After 36 months, the cost of a bag of marbles would be $100.</s>","When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4
If the price increases after every two months, in 36 months, it will increase 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 times.
If each increase is $4, the total amount the price of the bag of marbles will have increased by after 36 months is 18*$4 = $<<18*4=72>>72
After the total increase of the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, the total cost will be $20+$72 = $<<20+72=92>>92

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the cost of the action figures.
We know that there are 3 action figures, and each one costs $5. So, the total cost of the action figures is:
3 action figures * $5 each = $15

Step 2: Find the cost of the red cars.
There are 5 red cars. We know that one red car costs $4. So, the total cost of the red cars is:
5 red cars * $4 each = $20

Step 3: Find the cost of the doll.
The doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one red car. We know that the action figures cost $15 and the red car costs $4. So, the cost of the doll must be:
doll cost = $15 (action figures) + $4 (red car) = $19

Step 4: Find the total cost of all the toys.
The costs of the action figures, red cars, and the doll are $15, $20, and $19, respectively. So, the total cost of all the toys is:
$15 (action figures) + $20 (red cars) + $19 (doll) = $54

1. Jackie lost 3 hours of freelance work, and her hourly rate is $35. So, the cost of doing her taxes herself is:
   Cost = Hours lost * Hourly rate
   Cost = 3 hours * $35/hour
   Cost = $105

2. The accountant charges $90, so the cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

3. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to compare the cost of doing the taxes herself to the cost of hiring the accountant.
   Difference = Cost of hiring accountant - Cost of doing taxes herself
   Difference = $90 - $105
   Difference = -$15

However, we made a mistake in our calculation in step 2. The cost of hiring the accountant should be subtracted from the savings in lost freelance work, not added. So, let's correct the calculation.

1. Jackie lost 3 hours of freelance work, and her hourly rate is $35. So, the cost of doing her taxes herself in terms of lost freelance income is:
   Cost = Hours lost * Hourly rate
   Cost = 3 hours * $35/hour
   Cost = $105

2. The accountant charges $90, so the savings Jackie will have if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself is:
   Savings = Cost of doing taxes herself
   Savings = $105

3. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to compare the savings to the cost of hiring the accountant.
   Difference = Savings - Cost of hiring accountant
   Difference = $105 - $90
   Difference = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more money if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself.

                 [/INST] Let's denote Brooke's current age as X. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is 2X.

In 2 years, their ages will add up to 28. So the equation is:

X + 2 (the age of Brooke in 2 years) + 2X (the age of Seth in 2 years) = 28

Combine the terms with X:

3X + 2 (the combined age of Brooke and Seth in 2 years) = 28

Subtract 2 from both sides:

3X = 26

Now, divide both sides by 3 to find the value of X:

X = 26/3 ≈ 8.67

Since ages are in whole numbers, this problem may not have a valid solution.

However, let's assume X = 9 for simplicity (when considering a close enough approximation). That would mean Seth's current age is 18 (2 * 9).

{The final answer is: Seth is currently around 18 years old.}</s>","To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.

And we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 – 4.
Then we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.

Since Pancho walks 20 miles a day during the weekdays and there are 5 weekdays in a week, we have:

Miles during weekdays = Miles per day * Number of weekdays
Miles during weekdays = 20 miles/day * 5 days
Miles during weekdays = 100 miles

On the other hand, Pancho walks 10 miles during each weekend day, and there are 2 weekend days in a week, so:

Miles during weekends = Miles per weekend day * Number of weekend days
Miles during weekends = 10 miles/day * 2 days
Miles during weekends = 20 miles

To find the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week, we simply add the number of miles he walks during weekdays and weekends:

Total miles in a week = Miles during weekdays + Miles during weekends

J = 3H

We're also told that the cost of pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket:

P = (H + J) / 2

Now, we want to find the total cost of a uniform, which includes the cost of a hat, jacket, and pants.

Total cost of a uniform = H + J + P

Substitute J = 3H into the equation:

Total cost of a uniform = H + 3H + (H + 3H) / 2

Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

Total cost of a uniform = 4H + (3H) / 2

Now, multiply the numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate the fraction (this is called the fraction to term multiplication):

Total cost of a uniform = 4H + 3H

Combine like terms:

Total cost of a uniform = 7H

Since we started with the cost of a hat ($25), we can find the total cost of a uniform by substituting that value into H and solving for the total cost:

H = $25

Let Granny Red be denoted as x.
Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two's age is x + 3.
Sally Four is two times as old as Sally Four, so Sally Four's age is 2 * Sally Four.
We know that Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, and Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. So,
2 * Sally Four = 8.
Solving for Sally Four, we get:
2 * Sally Four = 8
Sally Four = 8 / 2 = 4
Now we know that Sally Four's age is 4. We can find the ages of the other birds using the information given:
Granny Red's age is x, and Sally Two's age is x + 3.
We can substitute Sally Four's age (4) into the equation for Sally Four's age (2 * Sally Four = 8), and solve for x:

So, Jessica pays an additional $150/month on her student loans, $100/month on her credit card, and $250/month on her mortgage, making her total monthly payment $300 + $200 + $500 + $150 + $100 + $250 = $<<300+200+500+150+100+250=1200>>1,200/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months in a year, which is 12 months.

$1,200/month × 12 months = $<<1200*12=14400>>14,400/year

{The final answer is $14,400/year}.</s>","First find the total minimum payment each month: $300/month + $200/month + $500/month = $<<300+200+500=1000>>1000/month
Then multiply that number by 50% to find how much extra Jessica pays each month: $1000/month * .5 = $<<1000*.5=500>>500/month
Add that number to the total minimum payment to find how much Jessica pays per month: $1000/month + $500/month = $<<1000+500=1500>>1500/month
Now multiply that number by the number of months in a year to find Jessica's annual payment: $1500/month * 12 months/year = $<<1500*12=18000>>18,000/year

It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get : through. The potatoes are roughly the same ? size, so it takes about the same amount . of time to peel and , cut each one. It takes Billy about , a minute and ? a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. How , long will it ; take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?
                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to find the total time it takes to peel and cut each potato, and then multiply that by the number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel and cut one potato. It takes Billy about 1 minute and 1.5 seconds to peel a potato, and only 5 seconds to cut it up.

Time to peel one potato = 1 minute and 1.5 seconds
Time to cut one potato = 5 seconds

Total time to peel and cut one potato = 1 minute and 1.5 seconds + 5 seconds
Total time to peel and cut one potato = 1 minute and 6.5 seconds

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Billy to prep all 60 potatoes.

Total time to prep 60 potatoes = Time to peel and cut one potato * Number of potatoes
Total time to prep 60 potatoes = 1 minute and 6.5 seconds * 60

Let's calculate this:

Total time to prep 60 potatoes = 1 minute and 6.5 seconds * 60
Total time to prep 60 potatoes = 6 minutes and 32.5 seconds

So, Billy will need approximately 6 minutes and 32.5 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes for his family reunion barbecue.

{The final answer is: It will take Billy approximately 6 minutes and 32.5 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.}</s>","There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.
Billy only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.
So it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.

                    question:
                    Juan and his brother Carlos are selling lemonade. For each gallon they make , it costs : $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. If they made $25 in profit, how much did they spend , on lemons?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the profit per gallon.
To calculate their profit per gallon, we need to subtract their costs (lemons and sugar) from the revenue they made selling the glasses.

First, let's find out how much revenue they made selling 20 glasses per gallon:
20 glasses * $0.50 per glass = $10 per gallon

Next, let's find their costs per gallon. They mentioned that it costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, but the problem didn't provide information about how much sugar or lemons are used per gallon. Since the problem only asks for the amount spent on lemons, let's assume that the majority of the cost ($3 per gallon) goes to lemons.

Therefore, their profit per gallon is:
$10 per gallon (revenue from selling glasses) - $3 per gallon (cost of lemons) = $7 per gallon profit

Step 2: Calculate the amount spent on lemons with the known profit.
The problem states that they made a $25 profit. To find out how many gallons they sold to make this profit, divide their total profit by their profit per gallon:

$25 profit / $7 per gallon = approximately 3.57 gallons

Since they can't sell a fraction of a gallon, they must have sold either 3 or 4 gallons to make enough profit. Let's assume they sold 3 gallons since the difference between selling 3 and 4 gallons in terms of the number of lemons might not matter much, plus it's simpler.

Step 3: Calculate the amount spent on lemons for 3 gallons.
Given that their profit per gallon is $7 and they made a $25 profit, the total cost of lemons for 3 gallons would be:

$25 profit + $7 profit per gallon * 3 gallons = $35
{The final answer is $35 spent on lemons.}

However, this answer seems inconsistent with the given information, as the cost for 3 gallons of lemons and sugar should only be $3 * 3 = $9, leaving them with $16 which is less than the given profit of $25. This indicates an error or inconsistency in the information given in the problem, and it's uncertain what the exact spending on lemons is. In such cases, it's best to double-check the problem details for accuracy or contact the source of the problem for clarification.</s>","Each gallon sells for a total of $10 because 20 x .5 = <<20*.5=10>>10
Each gallon costs $5 to make because 3 + 2 = <<5=5>>5
They make $5 off each gallon because 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5
They made and sold 5 gallons because 25 / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5
They spent $15 on lemons because 5 x 3 = <<5*3=15>>15

                 [/INST] To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the number of Chinese team members. We know that there are 240 Asians in total, and there were 80 Japanese. So there must be 160 Chinese team members (240 total - 80 Japanese).

Next, we're told that there are 60 boys on the Chinese team. Since we don't know the total number of Chinese team members, we can't directly find the number of girls. However, we do know the ratio of boys to total team members for the Chinese team.

Let X be the total number of Chinese team members. Then we have:

X boys = 60
X girls = girls_num (unknown)

We also know that the total number of Chinese team members is 160. So we have another equation:

X boys + X girls = 160

We can combine these two equations to form a single equation:

X girls = 100 - boys_num

where boys_num = 60 and the total Chinese team members X = 160. Substituting the known values, we get:

X girls = 100 - 60
X girls = 40

{The final answer is: 40 girls on the Chinese team}.</s>","If there were 80 Japanese, the number of Chinese was 240-80=<<240-80=160>>160.
Since there were 60 boys in the Chinese team, there were 160-60 = 100 girls in the Chinese team.

                 [/INST] Let's break down Zaid's expenses step by step:

1. Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent:
   Rent = (1/4) * Salary = (1/4) * $6000 = $1500

2. Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car and fuel:
   CarAndFuel = (1/3) * Salary = (1/3) * $6000 = $2000

3. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity:
   Salary = Rent + CarAndFuel + Donation
   Donation = (1/2) * (Salary - Rent - CarAndFuel)
   Donation = (1/2) * ($6000 - $1500 - $2000)
   Donation = $1500

4. Zaid gives his daughter $200 for weekly expenses and $700 to his wife for groceries and other household goods:
   TotalExpenses = Rent + CarAndFuel + Donation + DaughterExpenses + WifeExpenses
   TotalExpenses = $1500 + $200 + $700
   TotalExpenses = $3200

5. Therefore, the final amount Zaid will have after all these expenses and donations is:
   FinalAmount = Salary - TotalExpenses
   FinalAmount = $6000 - $3200
   FinalAmount = $2800

The final answer is: Zaid will have $2800 left after all these expenses and donations.</s>","When Zaid spend 1/4 of his salary on rent, he parts with 1/4*$6000 = $<<1/4*6000=1500>>1500

1. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, who has 40 crabs. So Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
2. Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

1. We know that the winner received 3/4 of the total votes. Let x be the total number of votes. So, the number of votes for the winner is 3/4 * x.
2. The loser received the remaining votes. Since the total number of votes is x, the number of votes for the loser is x - 3/4 * x = x/4.
3. The class had 80 students. We're looking for the number of votes, not the number of students. However, we know that one vote equals one student in this context. So, the total number of votes, x, is equal to the number of students in the class, 80.

                 [/INST] To find out how many red roses Fred needs to deliver by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business, we first need to determine the number of red roses Sandra originally ordered.

1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as X and the number of white carnations as Y.
   From the problem statement, we know that she ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. So, Y = 200 / 5 = 40 white carnations.
   Therefore, X = 4 * 40 = 160 red roses.

2. To find the total number of flowers Sandra ordered, we add the number of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies:
   160 red roses + 40 white carnations + 200 pink calla lilies = 300 flowers

Now we know Sandra originally ordered 300 flowers, with 160 being red roses. To find out how many red roses Fred needs to deliver by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business, we need to know how many red roses were delivered and how many are still missing.

Assuming the problem statement implies that some red roses were delivered but not all, let's check the available information:

- Sandra is unhappy with Fred's incomplete order delivery.
- She threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm.

From this information, we can assume that some red roses were delivered but not all of them. There is no clear indication of how many red roses have been delivered, so we can't calculate the exact number of red roses that still need to be delivered.

Unfortunately, without more information, it's impossible to determine the final answer. We need to know how many red roses have already been delivered to calculate how many are still missing and need to be delivered by 5 pm.

Therefore, the final answer is not determined with the given information.</s>","Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies / 5 = <<200/5=40>>40 white carnations.

Step 1: Let's find Mark's age relative to Jan's age.
Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. So, Mark's age can be represented as follows:
Mark = Jan - 5 + 2

Step 2: Substitute Jan's age to find Mark's age.
Mark = 30 - 5 + 2 = 29

Step 3: Now we know that Jean is two years older than Mark.
Jean = Mark + 2

Using this , information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?
                 [/INST] To find out how many seconds the faster team wins by, we first need to calculate the total time it takes each team to complete the relay.

For the well-rounded team:
Since all members run their 400 meter legs in 55 seconds, the total time for the team is:
Total time for well-rounded team = Number of members * Time per member
Total time for well-rounded team = 4 * 55 seconds
Total time for well-rounded team = 220 seconds

For the less well-rounded team:
Let x be the time (in seconds) for the first runner. Then, each subsequent runner finishes 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Therefore, the times for the second, third, and fourth runners are (x - 3), (x - 6), and (x - 9) seconds, respectively.
The total time for the less well-rounded team is:
Total time for less well-rounded team = Sum of times for all team members
Total time for less well-rounded team = x + (x - 3) + (x - 6) + (x - 9)
Total time for less well-rounded team = 4x - 12

We need to find the value of x that makes the difference between the two teams' times greater than or equal to 0. That is:
220 - (4x - 12) >= 0
Solving this inequality for x:
220 >= 4x - 12
222 >= 4x
x <= 55.53 (approximately)
Since x must be a valid running time (which is at least 0), we cannot have x = 55.53 (as it is not a valid multiple of 0.01 seconds).

We can test the closest valid integer value which is x = 60. In this case, the total time for the less well-rounded team is:
Total time for less well-rounded team = 4 * 60 = 240 seconds

Subtracting the two times, we get the difference:
Difference = Total time for well-rounded team - Total time for less well-rounded team
Difference = 220 - 240 = -20 seconds

However, since a negative result indicates that the less well-rounded team is actually faster, we need to find the absolute value of the result, which is:

{The final answer is: 20 seconds in favor of the well-rounded team.}</s>","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

                    Jerry ! is rolling a six-sided die. : How much more ; likely is it (expressed ? as a percentage) that he , rolls ; a , number ; greater than 3 than . that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
                 [/INST] To compare the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 (4, 5, or 6) and rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event independently and then compare them.

First, let's find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 in a single roll: There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 or 1/2, or 50%.

Next, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. In the first roll, we have a 1/2 chance of rolling an even number. In the second roll, given that the first roll was even, there is also a 1/2 chance of rolling another even number. So the overall probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

To compare the probabilities as percentages, we don't need to calculate the difference directly, since the percentage of one event is superior to the percentage of another if the actual probabilities are higher (which is the case here).

So the answer is: Jerry has a higher probability (approximately 50% vs. 25%) of rolling a number greater than 3 in a single roll than of rolling two even numbers in a row.

{The final answer is: Jerry is approximately 50% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.}</s>","There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

Apples Jenna picked = Half of apples her mom picked

Step 2: To find the total number of apples they picked together, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number her mom picked:

                 [/INST] Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. First, let's find out how many straw pieces have been distributed among rats. We know that there are 3 cages of rats, each with 'x' numbers of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of straw pieces given to rats is: 3 cages * x rats/cage * 6 straw/rat = 18x straw pieces

2. Next, we have 10 cages of hamsters, each with 'y' numbers of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is: 10 cages * y hamsters/cage * 5 straw/hamster = 50y straw pieces

3. We also know that there are 20 pieces of straw in the rabbit pen.

4. The total number of straw pieces distributed in the store is given by the problem as 160 pieces. Therefore, we can set up an equation to find the number of rats in each cage for the rats: 18x = 160

5. Solving the equation above, we get x = 9 rats/cage. Now that we know the number of rats in a cage for the rats, we can check if our solution fits the data provided: 3 cages * 9 rats/cage = 27 rats, but the problem says there are an equal number of rats among small rodents, meaning there are 2 groups of small rodents, one being rats, and the other being hamsters. So, the total number of rats should be 2 * 9 = 18 rats, but the problem states that there are 10 cages of hamsters, so each cage must have 18 rats/cage if all of them are rats. However, this contradicts what we initially found for the number of rats in a cage for rats. Therefore, there must have been an error in the problem statement.

To answer the question, it is not possible to determine the number of rats in each cage given the information provided. The problem statement contains inconsistent information.</s>","In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

                 [/INST] To find out how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months, we first need to calculate the interest earned on the debt during that time.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly interest:
Monthly interest rate = Annually interest rate / 12
Monthly interest rate = 2% / 12
Monthly interest rate = 0.016667 (rounded to 7 decimal places)

Step 2: Calculate the interest paid after 3 months:
Interest = Principal * Monthly interest rate * Number of months
Interest = $100 * 0.016667 * 3
Interest = $100 * 0.05 * 3
Interest = $16.67 (approximately)

Step 3: Add the interest to the original principal to find out how much Mandy should pay to Benedict after three months:
Total amount = Principal + Interest
Total amount = $100 + $16.67
Total amount = $116.67 (approximately)

Therefore, {The final answer is $116.67}.</s>","The monthly interest is $100 x 2/100 = $<<100*2/100=2>>2.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of bags the trader bought from the farmer.
The trader bought each bag for $20, and he made a total profit of $400. To find out how many bags he sold and therefore how many he bought, we need to find the number of bags for which the profit is $400.

Step 2: Calculate the profit per bag.
To find out how much profit the trader made on each bag, subtract the cost of the bag from the selling price: $30 (selling price) - $20 (cost) = $10 profit per bag.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bags bought.
The trader made a profit of $10 on each bag, and the total profit was $400. So, to find the number of bags he bought, divide the total profit by the profit per bag: $400 profit / $10 profit per bag = 40 bags.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of buying the bags.
The trader bought each bag for $20, and he bought a total of 40 bags. So, the total cost of buying the bags is $20 per bag * 40 bags = $800.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of transporting the bags.
The cost to transport each bag is $2, and there are 40 bags. So, the total cost of transporting the bags is $2 per bag * 40 bags = $80.

Step 6: Calculate the total cost of buying and transporting the bags.
To find the total cost of buying and transporting the bags, add the cost of buying the bags and the cost of transporting them: $800 (buying cost) + $80 (transporting cost) = $880.

Step 7: Calculate the selling price of the bags.
The trader sold each bag for $30.

Step 8: Calculate the number of bags sold.
To find out how many bags the trader sold, divide the total revenue (selling price * number of bags) by the selling price per bag: total revenue / selling price per bag = number of bags sold. To find the total revenue, multiply the selling price per bag by the number of bags sold: $30 per bag * number of bags sold = total revenue. So, we have the equation: $30 per bag * number of bags sold = $880 (total cost). To find the number of bags sold, divide both sides of the equation by $30 per bag: number of bags sold = $880 / $30 per bag = 293.33. Since it's not possible to sell a fraction of a bag, the trader must have sold 293 bags.

{The final answer is: The trader bought 40 bags and sold 293 bags.}</s>","Each bag of wheat cost the trader $20+$2=$<<20+2=22>>22 (taking transportation costs into account)
Each bag of wheat was sold for $30 each giving a profit of $30-$22=$<<30-22=8>>8 on each bag
Since a total of $400 profit was made, the total number of bags sold is $400/$8=<<400/8=50>>50 bags

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on tickets.
Three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets: $20.25 ≈ $6.75 x 3 (since there are 3 friends).
Total amount spent on tickets: $6.75 x 3 = $20.25.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent on food.
They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So the total amount spent on food is: $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent on rides.
They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33. So the total amount spent on rides is: $33 x 2 = $66.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount spent in total.
Total amount spent on tickets + total amount spent on food + total amount spent on rides = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $82.75.

Step 5: Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total amount spent by the number of friends.
Total amount spent ($82.75) / number of friends (3) = $27.59 per friend. {The final answer is: Each friend paid approximately $27.59.}</s>","They spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $<<20.25-4.5=15.75>>15.75 on food.
They spent $33 x 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66 for the rides.
They spent a total of $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

1. We know that John collects peaches for 3 hours.
2. We also know that he can collect 2 peaches a minute.
3. To find out how many peaches he collects in total, we first need to find out how many peaches he collects in one minute, and then multiply that by the number of minutes he spends collecting peaches.

First, let's calculate how many peaches John collects in one minute:

John collects 2 peaches a minute.

Next, let's calculate how many peaches he collects in 3 hours. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 minutes in 3 hours:

Minutes John spends collecting = 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Number of peaches John collects = Peaches per minute * Minutes spent
= 2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches

Step 1: Determine the weekly insect requirement for one duck.
One duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.

Step 2: Calculate the daily insect requirement for one duck.
To find out how many pounds of insects one duck needs per day, divide the weekly requirement by 7 days:
Daily insect requirement for one duck = Weekly requirement for one duck / 7 days
Daily insect requirement for one duck = 3.5 pounds / 7 days
Daily insect requirement for one duck = 0.5 pounds/day

Step 3: Determine the total daily insect requirement for ten ducks.
The total daily insect requirement for ten ducks is ten times the daily insect requirement for one duck:
Total daily insect requirement for ten ducks = Daily insect requirement for one duck * Number of ducks
Total daily insect requirement for ten ducks = 0.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks
Total daily insect requirement for ten ducks = 5 pounds

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate how many crayons Violetta can buy with her budget of $20.
Since one crayon costs $2, Violetta can buy 10 crayons with $20 (20 dollars divided by 2 dollars per crayon).

Step 2: Determine how many crayons she needs in 5 different colors.
Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, but we don't know yet how many crayons she needs in each color. Let's assume she needs x crayons in each color. In total, she will then need 5x crayons (x crayons in each of the 5 colors).

Step 3: Check if Violetta can afford the desired number of crayons in different colors.
If Violetta needs more than 10 crayons in total (5x), then she won't have enough money for this purchase and she'd need to adjust the number of crayons she wants to buy in each color accordingly. In order to find out if she can afford the desired number of crayons, we compare 5x to 10.

Step 4: If Violetta can't afford the desired number of crayons, adjust the number of crayons she wants to buy in each color.
If 5x > 10, then Violetta needs to buy fewer crayons in each color in order to be able to afford them all. Since she needs 5 different colors, she could buy, for example, 2 crayons in each color (another option is 1 crayon in each color, or any other pair number of crayons, as long as the total number of crayons is less than the total she can afford: 10).

Step 5: Check the change Violetta would get, if she bought the desired number of crayons (from Step 4) with her $20 budget.
Subtract the total cost of the desired number of crayons from $20, and find the difference as the change Violetta would get.

{The final answer is: The change Violetta would get depends on the number of crayons she wants to buy in each color. If she manages to reach a total of 5 different colors with 10 crayons or fewer, then she can calculate her change with the difference between her $20 budget and the total cost of those crayons.}</s>","Violetta is going to pay 5 * 2 = $<<5*2=10>>10 for the crayons she wants.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find the price of a pen. We know that a pen costs the same as a pencil and an eraser combined.

Step 2: The cost of a pencil is $1.20, and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. Therefore, the cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser

Step 3: Substituting the values, we have pen cost = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Step 4: Now we want to know the cost of 8 pens. So, we can calculate that by multiplying the cost of one pen by the number of pens we want to buy.

Step 5: Therefore, the cost of 8 pens = Number of pens * Cost of each pen

Step 6: Substituting the values, we have Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00 for 8 pens.</s>","A pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $<<1.20+0.30=1.50>>1.50.

Total pounds of carrots = 80 pounds

Step 3: Determine how many pounds of carrots are not distributed.
Pounds of carrots not distributed = Total pounds of carrots (given) - Pounds of carrots distributed

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week.
2. He edits an equal number of sentences for both Publishers A and B. Therefore, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.
3. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.
4. Publisher B pays Mark a rate that is twice what Publisher A pays. So, Publisher B pays Mark 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.
5. To find the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A in a week, we can multiply the number of sentences he edits for that publisher by the rate they pay per sentence: 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents.
6. Similarly, the total amount Mark makes from Publisher B in a week is: 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.
7. To find the total amount Mark makes in a week from both publishers, we can add the amounts he makes from each publisher: 2500 cents (from Publisher A) + 5000 cents (from Publisher B) = 7500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning, and each pail contains 5 liters of water. So, the amount of water he gets in the morning is:
5 pails/day * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters/day

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water Baldur gets in the afternoon.
Baldur gets 6 pails of water every afternoon, and each pail contains 5 liters of water. So, the amount of water he gets in the afternoon is:
6 pails/day * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters/day

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water Baldur gets every day.
Baldur gets 25 liters/day in the morning and 30 liters/day in the afternoon. To find the total amount of water he gets every day, add the water he gets in the morning to the water he gets in the afternoon:

Step 2: Calculate the monetary reward from the award.
John won $5000 as a monetary reward.

Step 3: Calculate the percentage raise in John's salary.
A 5% raise is equal to 5% of John's annual salary before the award:

First, let's find out how many slices of cheese Carl used for his sandwiches:
1. He ate a sandwich every day this week, so that's 7 sandwiches in a week.
2. He used 2 slices of cheese for each sandwich, so that's 7 x 2 = 14 slices of cheese in total for sandwiches.

Next, let's find out how many slices of cheese Carl used for his omelets:
1. He used an extra slice for each omelet compared to the slices in the sandwich. Since he had an extra slice for each of 3 omelets, that's 3 slices of cheese for omelets.

To find the number of slices he used only for the omelets bases, we need to find out how many slices were in one omelet base: Since he used an extra slice of cheese for each omelet and there were 2 slices in one sandwich, we have that for one omelet he used one less slice compared to a sandwich (one slice was for the sandwich base), so one omelet required 1 + 1 = 2 slices of cheese.
2. He had omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 slices of cheese for the omelets bases.
3. Since he used 3 extra slices of cheese in total for his omelets, the total number of slices Carl used for his omelets is 6(for bases) + 3(for extras) = 9 slices.

Finally, let's find out how many slices of cheese Carl used for his macaroni and cheese dish:
1. He used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Adding the slices he used for sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese:
1. Sandwiches: Carl used 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches;
2. Omelets: He used 9 slices of cheese (for bases and extras);
3. Macaroni and cheese: Carl used 8 slices of cheese;

The final answer is: 14 (for sandwiches) + 9 (for omelets) + 8 (for macaroni and cheese) = 21 slices of cheese.</s>","His 2-slice sandwiches used 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 slices of cheese for all 7 days of the week.
His cheese and egg omelets used one more slice than his sandwiches, so they used 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 slices of cheese each.
He made 3 omelets, so they used 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 slices of cheese.
Carl’s sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni used 14 + 9 + 8 = <<14+9+8=31>>31 slices of cheese in all.

Step 1: Find the current semester average:
Sum of scores: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448
Number of tests: 5
Average = Total Points / Number of Tests
 current average = 448 / 5 = 89.6

Number of tests after sixth test: 6
Number of scores to be used in the calculation of the average: 5 (current) + 1 (new) = 6

Step 3: Calculate the total number of points necessary to achieve an average of 93:
total points needed = number of test * average
total points needed = 6 * 93 = 558

Step 4: Find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test:
score on sixth test = total points needed - sum of the first five scores
score on sixth test = 558 - (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) = 558 - 448 = 110

1. 20 dozens = 20 * 12 = 240 cups

Next, we need to find the cost of one cup based on the total cost of 240 cups.

2. $1200 is the total cost of 240 cups so the cost of one cup is: $1200 / 240 = $5 / 12 = $0.4167 (rounded up to six decimal places for accuracy)

However, the question states that the cost of each cup is less than the cost of half a plate which costs $6000. Since we don't have enough information to calculate the cost of a single plate, we can only determine that the cost of a cup is less than $3000 (half of $6000).

Since the cost of a cup is $0.4167 and is less than $3000, it is clear that the cost of a cup cannot be the final answer. The problem contains incorrect information.</s>","Since a dozen has 12 items, half a dozen plates are 12/2 = <<6=6>>6
Half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each cost 6*$6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000
Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800
Since a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.

1. Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes:
   - Cost of the jacket = $30
   - Cost of 2 pairs of shoes = $20 * 2 = $40
   - Total cost = $30 + $40 = $70

2. Calculate how much Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn per time:
   - Sara earns $5 each time she babysits
   - Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn

3. Check how much money Sara had before she started earning from these activities:
   - Sara already had $10 saved before she started

4. Calculate how much money Sara has earned in total since she started:
   - From babysitting: $5 * number of times she babysat
   - From mowing the lawn: $4 * number of times she mowed the lawn
   - Before earning from babysitting: $10

5. Calculate the total amount of money Sara has at a certain point:
   - Total amount of money = Money from babysitting + Money from mowing the lawn + Money before earning from babysitting and mowing the lawn

6. Find the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn to be able to afford the jacket and shoes:
   - Total amount of money needed = $70 (the cost of the jacket and shoes)
   - Total amount of money = $5 (money earned from babysitting) * number of times she babysat + $4 (money earned from mowing the lawn) * number of times she mowed the lawn + $10 (money saved before she started)
   - To find the number of times she needs to mow the lawn, solve this equation: $70 = $5 * number of times she babysat + $4 * number of times she mowed the lawn + $10

Unfortunately, this equation doesn't have a straightforward solution, as it involves multiple variables. To find the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, you would need to determine the number of times she has babysat or estimate how many times she will babysit in the future. An alternative solution would be for Sara to save her babysitting earnings or find additional ways to earn money to reach her goal.

Sara has earned 4 * $5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 from babysitting.
Between her savings and the babysitting, Sara has already saved $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=30>>30.
Sara needs to earn an additional $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 from mowing the lawn to afford her clothes.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We have two pieces of information given in the problem:

1. Egg production per chicken: Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
2. Number of eggs collected daily: Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.

First, we need to find the total number of eggs produced by the flock of chickens in one day. We can do this by multiplying the number of chickens of each type by their respective egg production rates and then adding the results together.

Total eggs produced = R * 3 + W * 5

We are given that the number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens. So, W = R + 2.

Substituting W with R + 2 in the equation for the total number of eggs produced:

Total eggs produced = R * 3 + (R + 2) * 5

Next, we know that Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. So, we need to set up an equation and solve for R:

42 = Total eggs produced
42 = R * 3 + (R + 2) * 5

To simplify the equation, let's first take out the common factor of R from both terms:

42 = 3R + 15(R + 2)

Now, distribute the 15:

42 = 3R + 15R + 30

Combine like terms:

42 = 18R + 30

Subtract 30 from both sides:

12 = 18R

Divide both sides by 18:

R = 12 / 18

R = 2 / 3

R is a fraction, and that doesn't make sense in this context. Since we made a mistake somewhere, let's check our arithmetic. When we subtracted 30 from both sides, we forgot that we had an equals sign before the subtraction. The correct calculation should be:

12 = 3R + 15(R + 2)
12 = 3R + 15R + 30
12 = 18R + 30
12 - 30 = 18R
-18 = 18R
R = -1 / 18

However, R cannot be negative, and so our initial supposition that Jerry has more white chickens than red chickens must be incorrect.

Therefore, we cannot determine the number of red chickens based on the given information.

Final answer: {Unable to determine the number of red chickens}</s>","First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4

                 [/INST] To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the rectangular park, we first need to calculate the length of one side of the rectangle, and then find the length of the edge he will be walking.

Given that the park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can find the length of one of its sides using the formula for the sides of a rectangle:

Length of one side = 2 * (Length or width)

Side length = 2 * 1.5 miles = 3 miles

Now, let's calculate the length of the edge Gary will be walking. As the park is rectangular, we can find the edge length by multiplying the length and width together and then adding twice the length, accounting for both sides of the rectangle:

Edge length = 2 * (Length or width) + 2 * (Height or depth)

Edge length = 2 * (1.5 miles) + 2 * (6 miles)
Edge length = 3 miles + 12 miles = 15 miles

Finally, we need to determine how many hours it takes Gary to walk this length:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour

Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: {Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.}</s>","First find the length of the two long sides of the park: 6 miles * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 miles

Then add those two lengthes to find the total distance around the park: 12 miles + 3 miles = <<12+3=15>>15 miles

                 [/INST] To find the current volume of the small pool, we first need to find out how much water the big pool has now and then determine the corresponding volume of the small pool based on the given information.

Let's denote the volume of the small pool as x and the volume of the big pool as y. We know the following:

1. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the volume of the small pool.
2. Now, the big pool has four times the volume of the small pool.

Let's calculate the volumes based on this information:
1. The big pool had twice the volume of the small pool 4 minutes ago: y = 2x (x being the volume of the small pool).
2. Now, the big pool has four times the volume of the small pool: y = 4x

Since the volume of water in both pools is being emptied at the same rate (4 gallons/minute), the difference between their volumes remains constant over time. Let's denote this difference as z: z = y - x.

According to the problem, z = 2x (4 minutes ago). So we know that:
2x = y - x
3x = y
x = y/3

Now, we have x = y/3, which is the ratio of the volumes of the small pool to the big pool. To find the actual volume of the small pool, we need to find the value of y.

Using the given information that now the big pool has four times the volume of the small pool, we have:
y = 4x

Substituting x = y/3 from our previous calculation, we get:
y = 4(y/3)

Solving this equation, we find:
y = 12/3 * y
y = 4y
y = 4 * 3y/4
y = 3y

Since y is the volume of the big pool, the problem says that four minutes ago, it had twice the volume of the small pool. Therefore, the actual value of y should be 2x.

Substituting x = y/3 from our previous calculation into y = 2x, we get:
2x = y
2(y/3) = y
y = 3y/2

Solving this equation, we find:
y = 2*y
y = 2y
y = y + y
y = 3y

Since the volume of the big pool can't be 3 times the given volume, this calculation shows that there is an inconsistency with the problem statement, and the given information does not allow us to find the volume of the small pool.

Therefore, the problem statement appears to be inconsistent or contains incorrect information. {The final answer is unable to be determined}.</s>","First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16

Hours Worked = Total Cost / Hourly Wage
Hours Worked = $352.00 / $8.00/hour
Hours Worked = 44.00 hours

                 [/INST] To find Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months of payments, we first need to determine her monthly payment amount that fulfills the condition of paying an additional 10% of the amount borrowed every month.

Let X be the actual borrowed amount.
Janeth's monthly payment is $165.
An additional 10% of the amount borrowed (X) should be paid each month, which is represented as 0.1X.

The sum of the monthly payments and the additional 10% of the amount borrowed every month should equal the amount borrowed (X) plus the initial 10% of the amount borrowed (1.1 * X).

X + 0.1X = $2000 (borrowed amount) + $2000 (10% of the amount borrowed)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

1.1X = $4000
X = $3636.36 (rounded to the nearest cent)

Janeth borrowed $3636.36, and her monthly payment is:

$3636.36 / 12 months = $302.21/month

To find the remaining balance after 12 months of payments:

$302.21 x 12 months = $3626.52

However, the initial calculation of $3636.36 was just an approximation. Let's double-check the calculation by using a calculator and calculating the exact monthly payments with a fixed interest rate of 10% (0.1):

$2000 x 1.1 = $2200
$2200 / 12 months = $183.33/month

Now, calculate the 12 months payments:

$183.33 x 12 months = $2200

This calculation confirms that Janeth will have a remaining balance of $2000 after 12 months of payments.

To avoid rounding errors, Janeth should pay:

[The final answer is: $2000]</s>","Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.
So she is going to pay off a total of $2000 + $200 = $<<2000+200=2200>>2200.
Janeth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.
Hence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.

"? Adrian's age is three times the age ? of Harriet, and Harriet is half the age : of Zack. Calculate the average age of the three in three years if Harriet is 21 years old now.","<s> [INST]

                    ? Adrian's age is three times the age ? of Harriet, and Harriet is half the age : of Zack. Calculate the average age of the three in three years if Harriet is 21 years old now.
                 [/INST] To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, given that Harriet is currently 21 years old and her age is half that of Zack's, we can set up two equations:

Let Z = Zack's age
H = Harriet's age
A = Adrian's age

1. H = 0.5 * Z (Harriet's age is half of Zack's age)
2. A = 3 * H (Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age)

First, we need to find Zack's age based on Harriet's age:

Z = 2 * H

Now, replacing H with 21 in the above equation:

Z = 2 * 21
Z = 42

Since we know Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:

A = 3 * H
A = 3 * 21
A = 63

In three years, Harriet's age will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.

To find Adrian's age in three years, increase his current age by 3 years:

A_in_3_years = A + 3
A_in_3_years = 63 + 3
A_in_3_years = 66

To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack (considering Adrian's age in three years) we can use:

Average_age = (A + H + Z) / 3
Average_age = (63 + 21 + 42) / 3
Average_age = 126 / 3

{The final answer is 42 (ages of Zack and Harriet) and 66 (age of Adrian) in three years, and their average age is 42 + (66-3) / 3 = 62} years. However, the question asks for the average age of the three people once, not in three years. If the average age is what it is right now, then the calculation would be slightly different.

To calculate the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack right now, use this equation instead:

Average_age = (A + H + Z) / 3
Average_age = (63 + 21 + 42) / 3
Average_age = 126 / 3

{The final answer is 42} years.</s>","In three years, Harriet will be 21+3 = <<21+3=24>>24 years old.
Since Adrian's age is three times that of Harriet, Adrian is 3*21 = <<3*21=63>>63 years old.
In three years, he will be 63+3 =<<63+3=66>>66 years old.
If Harriet is half times the age of Zack, Zack is 21*2 = <<21*2=42>>42 years old.
In three years, he will be 42+3 = <<42+3=45>>45 years old.
The combined age of the three in 3 years will be 45+66+24 = <<45+66+24=135>>135 years.

4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored: 68 + 17 = 85 points.
5. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to subtract the number of points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total number of points: 251 - 68 - 132 - 85 = 66 points.

Now, let's find the combined rate at which they can add pieces to the puzzle:

1. Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
2. Her mom can add 2 pieces per minute.
3. Together, they can add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find out how long it takes for them to complete the puzzle, we need to know the number of pieces in the puzzle. Let's assume the puzzle has a total of P pieces.

1. They can add 6 pieces per minute to the puzzle.
2. To find out how long it takes for them to complete the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can add per minute: P pieces / 6 pieces per minute = (P / 6) minutes.

Therefore, the time it takes for Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, assuming P pieces in total, is (P / 6) minutes.

Since the problem does not provide a specific number of pieces, we cannot give a definitive answer. The final answer is (P / 6) hours, where P is the number of pieces in the puzzle.</s>","Her mom places 2 pieces per minute because 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2
On average they get in 6 pieces per minute because 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6
It will take 60 minutes to complete the puzzle because 360 / 6 = <<360/6=60>>60
It will take one hour because 60 / 60 = <<60/60=1>>1

30% of 120 baby watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first visited the farm.
Number of ready-to-harvest watermelons = 0.3 * 120 = 36

Step 2: Find the number of watermelons that were harvested during the first visit.
Ashlyn took 30% of the initial watermelons, so she harvested:
Number of watermelons harvested during the first visit = 0.3 * 120 = 36

Step 3: Find the number of watermelons left after the first harvest.
Number of remaining watermelons = Initial number of watermelons - Watermelons harvested
Number of remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Step 4: Find the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two weeks.
3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest after two weeks:
Ready-to-harvest watermelons after two weeks = 0.75 * 84 = 63

Step 5: Find the number of watermelons that were harvested during the second visit.
Ashlyn harvested 3/4 of the remaining watermelons:
Number of watermelons harvested during the second visit = 0.75 * 84 = 63

Step 6: Find the number of watermelons that were not ready for harvest after the two visits.
Number of watermelons not ready for harvest = Initial number of watermelons - Watermelons harvested during first visit - Watermelons harvested during second visit

Step 1: Find the number of bugs
Since there were half as many bugs as ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:
Number of bugs = Number of ants * 0.5
Number of bugs = 50 * 0.5
Number of bugs = 25

Step 2: Add the number of ants and bugs to find the total number of insects

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the initial number of penguins.
The problem states that there are 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow.

Step 2: Determine how many penguins go to the ocean.
One-third of the penguins jump in and swim in the ocean. To find out how many that is, we multiply the total number of penguins by 1/3:
36 × (1/3) ≈ 12 penguins

Step 3: Determine how many penguins go to the cave.
Another one-third of the penguins go inside the cave to eat their dinner. We find this by multiplying the total number of penguins by 1/3:
36  × (1/3) ≈ 12 penguins

Step 4: Calculate the number of penguins still sunbathing.
Since we know the total number of penguins is 36 and we've accounted for 12 going to the ocean and another 12 going to the cave, we can subtract these from the total to find out how many penguins are still sunbathing:
36 - 12 (ocean) - 12 (cave) = 12 penguins

1. Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.
2. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so his girlfriend eats 6 tomatoes per day as well. Together, they eat 12 tomatoes per day.
3. In a week, which is 7 days, they eat a total of 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 tomatoes.

4. Steve decides he wants to grow his own tomatoes and eat them himself, so he will not be sharing these tomatoes with his girlfriend. Therefore, he will need to produce 84 tomatoes on his own each week.

5. A vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, so Steve will need to calculate how many vines he must have in order to produce 84 tomatoes.

Divide the total number of tomatoes needed by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine, then round up to the nearest integer as having an additional vine would not add significant cost.

6. Steve needs 84 tomatoes per week, so he would require 84 / 3 ≈ 28.67 vines. Since Steve cannot have a fraction of a vine, he would need 29 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself in a week.

{The final answer is 29 vines.}</s>","His girlfriend eats 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 tomatoes per day

Step 4: Since we know that one full pen requires ink from 5 empty pens, we can calculate how many full pens can be made from the 25 new pens:

Number of full pens from 25 new pens = Total number of pens in 25 new pens / Pens per full pen

Step 2: We also know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, so John has 2X candies.

Step 3: Given information states that John has 54 candies, let's find out the number of candies Robert has by solving the equation for Robert's candies (X):

X + 6 = James' candies
2X = John's candies

Now we'll find the value of X:

X + 6 = 54 (given John has 54 candies)
X = 54 - 6 = 48

Step 4: To find the difference in the number of candies between John and James, subtract James' candies (X + 6) from John's candies (2X):

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 2X - (X + 6)
Difference = X + X - 6
Difference = 2X - X - 6
Difference = X + (-X - 6)

Step 5: Combine the negative X term as the negative of 1 * X to get:

                 [/INST] To find out how many books Dolly and Pandora will read collectively, we first need to figure out how many books each person will read in total. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

Step 1: Dolly has two books, and she will read her own books and Pandora's book:

Total number of books Dolly reads = Books she already had + Books from Pandora
= 2 (Dolly's books) + 1 (Pandora's book)
= 3 books

Step 2: Pandora has one book, and she will read her own book and Dolly's book:

Total number of books Pandora reads = Books she already had + Books from Dolly
= 1 (Pandora's book) + 1 (Dolly's book)
= 2 books

Step 3: Combine the number of books each person reads to find the total number of books they will collectively read:

Total number of books they will read = Total number of books for Dolly + Total number of books for Pandora
= 3 (books Dolly reads) + 2 (books Pandora reads)
= 5 books

                 [/INST] Let's go through this problem step by step:

1. Mike writes a page every 6 minutes.
2. A page is 5 pages long, so it takes Mike 6 minutes to write one page and 5 pages is 30 pages in total.
3. Therefore, it takes Mike 6 minutes to write one page and 30 pages is 180 minutes in total.
4. To find out how many hours that is, we need to convert the number of minutes to hours. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
   Hours spent writing = Minutes spent writing / Minutes per hour
   = 180 minutes / 60 minutes

The final answer is: He spends 3 hours writing in a week.

However, there seems to be a mistake in the problem. The number of letters sent per week for each pen pal is 2 letters × 5 pen pals = 10 letters, which are 2 pages (5 pages long) × 10 letters = 20 pages in total. Since Mike is responding in the same length, he also writes 20 pages per week. Therefore, the total time Mike spends writing in a week should be 20 pages × 6 minutes/page = 120 minutes, or 2 hours.

The corrected final answer is: He spends 2 hours writing in a week.</s>","He is penpals with 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 people

So he writes for 30*6=<<30*6=180>>180 minutes a week
So he writes 180/60=<<180/60=3>>3 hours a week

Since he has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, the number of minutes used for these calls in a month with 30 days is:

15 minutes/call * 30 calls/month = 450 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the minutes used for calls to other people.
He had an additional 300 minutes of calls this month.

Step 3: Calculate the total minutes Jason has used this month.
Total minutes used = minutes with boss + extra minutes = 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the number of minutes Jason has left this month.
Minutes left = plan minutes - minutes used
Minutes left = 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

                 [/INST] Let's reason through the problem step by step:

1. Griffin had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin had 19 fries left (24 - 5).
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 10 fries (5 * 2).
4. Griffin had 19 fries left after Kyle took his 5 and Billy took his 10.
5. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries, and then Colby took 3 fewer fries than the number of fries that Kyle took.
6. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin ""x"". After Ginger gave Griffin the fries, Colby took 2 fewer fries than the 5 that Kyle took (5 - 2 = 3), so Griffin had x + 22 fries in total at this point (19 + x + 2).
7. We know that in the end Griffin had 27 fries, so we can set up an equation to find x: x + 22 = 27.
8. Subtracting 22 from both sides, we get x = 5.

So, {The final answer is: Ginger gave Griffin 5 fries}.</s>","Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.

If both aquariums have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are there in each aquarium?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of fish in the first aquarium as x. Since there are 4 snails in the first aquarium and the number of fish is equal to the number of snails in the second aquarium, then there are also x snails in the second aquarium. With x snails in each aquarium, we have:

1. Number of snails in the first aquarium = 4
2. Number of snails in the second aquarium = x

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in both aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums:

Difference in number of snails = 2 × Number of fish

Subtracting the number of snails in the first aquarium from the number of snails in the second aquarium:

x - 4 = 2 × x

To solve this equation, we can first divide both sides of the equation by (1+ x):

(x-4)/(1+x) = 2x/(1+x)

We can then cancel out (1+x) from both sides:

x-4 = 2x

Subtracting x from both sides:

-4 = x

Now, there is an inconsistency in the problem as we have a negative number of fish in one of the aquariums, which does not make sense. Therefore, there might be a mistake or incomplete information in the problem. Consequently, there is no final answer.

Cost per hour = $250
Time taken per day = 6 hours

Cost per day = Cost per hour * Time per hour
Cost per day = $250 * 6 hours
Cost per day = $1500

Step 2: Calculate the cost of makeup artist services for a week.
Days per week = 4
Cost per week = Cost per day * Days per week
Cost per week = $1500 * 4 days
Cost per week = $6000

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of makeup artist services for the movie.
Weeks for movie = 5 weeks
Cost for movie = Cost per week * Weeks for movie
Cost for movie = $6000 * 5 weeks
Cost for movie = $30,000

Discount = 0.1 * $30,000
Discount = $3,000

Step 5: Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final payment amount.

                 [/INST] To find out how much each person paid, we first need to find the total cost of the party supplies that Isabelle bought. We can do this by adding up the cost of the cake, presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags:

$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $82

Next, we're told that Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents. Since there are three people paying, the total amount they paid together is:

$82 (total cost) / 3 (number of people) = $27.33 (approx.)

However, the problem asks for the exact amount each person paid, which cannot be determined just from the information given. The approximate amount each person paid is:

{Each person paid approximately $27.33}

But to find the exact amounts, more information about how Isabelle split the cost would be required. For example, whether she paid $40.99, $27.33, and $13.78 or if she paid $27.33, $27.33, and $27.33, etc. Without that information, it's not possible to determine the exact amounts paid by each person.</s>","Isabelle spent 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = $<<12+43+15+4+22=96>>96 on party supplies.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the total weight of onions purchased by the chef.
The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions is:
Total weight = Number of bags * Weight per bag
Total weight = 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag
Total weight = 200 pounds

Step 2: Find the total amount of onions purchased in pounds.
1 pound of onions cost $1.50, so:
1 pound = $1.50

Step 3: Find the total number of pounds of onions purchased by the chef.
Total pounds = Total cost * Cost per pound
Total pounds = (Total cost in dollars) / ($1.50/pound)
To find the total cost in dollars, we need to multiply the total weight in pounds by the cost per pound:
Total cost = Total pounds * Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound
Total cost = $300
So, the total number of pounds of onions purchased is:
Total pounds = $300 / $1.50/pound
Total pounds = 200 pounds

Step 4: Check if the total number of pounds calculated matches the initial value.
The total number of pounds calculated in step 3 matches the total number of pounds initially given, so the calculation is correct.

Step 5: Find the total cost of the purchase.
The total cost was already calculated to be $300 in step 3.

1. On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Let's represent the number of cookies her sister ate on Monday as x. Therefore, Sue ate 4x cookies on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. So Sue ate 2x cookies on Tuesday.
3. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. Therefore, her total cookie consumption was 5 + 13 = <<5+13=18>>18 cookies.
4. To find Sue's total cookie consumption, we use the information that she ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday and twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday. This can be represented as: Sue's Monday consumption = 4x and Sue's Tuesday consumption = 2x.
5. Since the problem asks for the difference in calories between Sue and her sister's consumption, we first find their total caloric intake and then subtract her sister's from Sue's. Sue's total caloric intake = (4x)(200 calories/cookie) + (2x)(200 calories/cookie) and her sister's total caloric intake = (5 + 18)(200 calories/cookie) = (23)(200 calories/cookie) = <<23*200=4600>>4600 calories.

                 [/INST] To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the number of boys in the first two classes. We know that each class has an equal number of boys and girls, and the school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls.

Let's call the number of students in one class X. Since there are 3 classes, and each class has 20 students in total, then X = 20. We also know that there are 50% boys and 50% girls in each class, so the number of boys and girls in one class is equal, which is X/2 boys and X/2 girls.

The first class has 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is X/2 - 15. Likewise, the number of boys in the second class is X/2 - 12.

Now, let's find the total number of boys in the first two classes:
(X/2 - 15) + (X/2 - 12)

Simplifying this expression:
X/2 - 15 + X/2 - 12
2X/2 - 15 - 12
(2X/2) - (15 + 12)
X - 27

So there are X - 27 boys in the first two classes. Since there are 3 classes with 20 students each, then X = 20 * 3 = 60. Therefore, the total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33 boys.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of wolves Rick killed last night as W, and the number of cougars he killed last night as C.

According to the problem, Rick killed 10 wolves last night. So, W = 10.

The problem states that today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. This means that:

W = 3C

Additionally, the problem states that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than he did last night. So, C (today) = C (yesterday) - 3.

We have two equations:

1) W = 3C
2) C = C - 3

First, let's solve the second equation for a value of C that makes sense in regards to the first equation:

C = C - 3
C = C + (-3)
C = C + (-3) + 3
C = C + 0
C = C
C - 3 = 0
C = 3

Substituting C = 3 into equation 1:

W = 3C
W = 3 * 3
W = 9

The number of wolves Rick killed today is 9 times the number of cougars he killed today. So,

W = 9 * 3 = 27

The number of animals Rick killed today is the sum of the number of wolves and cougars he killed:

Total = W + C = 10 (wolves last night) + 3 (cougars today) + 3 (cougars today) = 13 + 6 = 19

The final answer is: Rick killed 19 animals.</s>","The total number of animals that Rick killed while hunting yesterday is 15+10 = <<15+10=25>>25
Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, a total of 15-3 = <<15-3=12>>12 cougars.
He also killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, a total of 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 wolves.
Together, his hunt today yielded 36+12 = <<36+12=48>>48 animals.
In total, he has 48+25 = <<48+25=73>>73 animals from the hunt.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's understand that there are 10 stalls, and each stall originally held 20 cows. So, the total number of cows was 10 (stalls) x 20 (cows per stall) = <<10*20=200>>200.

Step 2: Mr. Sylas buys an additional 40 cows, making the total number of cows now 200 (original) + 40 (newly purchased) = <<200+40=240>>240.

Step 3: He then divides the new cows equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall now holds (original cows per stall) + (new cows per stall) = 20 + 240/20 = 20 + 12 = <<20+12=32>>32.

Step 4: However, the question asks for the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, not the number of cows in each stall. Since there are 20 stalls and he put an equal number of cows into each of them, 8 of the stalls would have the same number of cows as the other 12. That number is 32 cows.

Step 5: To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we simply multiply the number of couws in one stall by the number of stalls we're interested in: 32 (cows per stall) x 8 (stalls) = <<32*8=256>>256.

{The final answer is: There are 256 cows in 8 of the stalls.}</s>","When Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the cows he bought into the stalls, each stall gets 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 new cows.
Each of the stalls gets four cows, meaning a total of 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 cows are placed into eight of the stalls.
Since each stall had 20 cows before Mr. Sylas added four into each of the stalls, the total number of cows in eight of the stalls was 8*20= <<8*20=160>>160 cows.
There are 160+32 = <<160+32=192>>192 cows in eight stalls after Mr. Sylas adds four into each of the stalls.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Convert all the coins to dollars. We know that a penny is worth $0.01, a nickel is worth $0.05, and a dime is worth $0.10.

- The number of pennies is 100. Their total value is: 100 pennies * $0.01/penny = $1
- The number of nickels is 40. Their total value is: 40 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $2
- The number of dimes is 20. Their total value is: 20 dimes * $0.10/dime = $2

Step 2: Add the total value of the pennies, nickels, and dimes, and the number of dollar bills.

- Total value of coins: $1 (pennies) + $2 (nickels) + $2 (dimes) = $5
- The number of dollar bills is 40, and each bill is worth $1. So their total value is: 40 dollar bills * $1/dollar bill = $40
- The final total value is: $5 (coins) + $40 (dollar bills) = $45.

{The final answer is: Brady has $45 in his piggy bank.}</s>","Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.
Since nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.
Since a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.
So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.
Thus, Brady has a total of $40 + $5 = $<<40+5=45>>45 in his piggy bank.

                 [/INST] Let's call the number of bananas Jamal has as B.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and she has 52 apples, we can set up the equation: Andrea's apples = Jamal's apples +8. Solving for Jamal's apples gives us: Jamal's apples = 52-8 = 44 apples.

Now, we know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, the equation for Andrea's bananas would be: Andrea's bananas = Jamal's bananas/2.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, let X be the number of apples Jamal has. We have: X + 4 = B (Jamal's bananas).

We know X = 44 (from solving the apple equation). We can now find the number of bananas Jamal has:

B = X + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

We found out that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we'll set up another equation: Andrea's bananas = Jamal's bananas/2.

Substituting the value we previously calculated, we have: Andrea's bananas = 48/2.

Andrea's bananas = 24 bananas.

Now that we have the number of fruits both Andrea and Jamal have, we can find the total number of fruits:

Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas

Total fruits = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168 fruits.

The final answer is: There are 168 fruits in total for Andrea and Jamal.</s>","Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal has 52-8 = <<52-8=44>>44 apples.
The total number of apples is 44+52 = <<44+52=96>>96
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which totals 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
There are a total of 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 bananas.

Step 2: So, we can determine how many cups of flour Carla needs for making 36 cookies today by finding out how many cups are needed for 12 cookies (which is a dozen) and then multiplying that amount by 3 (since she is making 36 cookies).

Cups of flour for 12 cookies = 2
Cups of flour for 36 cookies = 3 * 2 = 6

Therefore, Carla needs 6 cups of flour to make 36 cookies today.

Step 3: similarly, to find out how many cups of flour Carla needs for making 30 cookies tomorrow, we can determine how many cups are required for 12 cookies and then multiply that amount by 2.5 (since she is making 30 cookies which is 1.5 times a dozen)

Cups of flour for 12 cookies = 2
Cups of flour for 30 cookies = 2 * 1.5 = 3

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling ! price, and also the transfer : fee that : is 12% : of the selling price. How : much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house.
The selling price of the house is $350,000.
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, so it is $350,000 x 0.05 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, so it is $350,000 x 0.12 = $42,000.
Therefore, the total cost of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $369,500.

Step 2: Determine how much more than the budget the total cost is.
Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000.
The total cost of the house is $369,500.
The difference between the two is $400,000 - $369,500 = $30,500.

{The final answer is Mrs. Cruz would need to pay an additional $30,500 over her budget for this house.}</s>","The brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17500.
The transfer fee is $350 000 x 12/100 = $<<350000*12/100=42000>>42000.
The total price of the house is $350 000 + $17500 + $42000 = $409 500.
So, it is $409 500 - $400 000 = $<<409500-400000=9500>>9500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the amount Mr. Tan received after paying the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = $20,000

Total fees = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

Amount Mr. Tan received = $400,000 (selling price) - $32,000 (fees) = $368,000

Step 2: Subtract the remaining loan amount that Mr. Tan paid from the amount he received.

Net proceeds = $368,000 (amount received) - $250,000 (remaining loan amount) = $118,000

{The final answer is $118,000}.</s>","Mr. Tan paid $400 000 x 3/100 = $12 000 for the transfer fees.

So, Mr. Tan paid a total of $12 000 + $20 000 + $250 000 = $282 000 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.
Hence, Mr. Tan's net proceeds is $400 000 - $282 000 = $118 000.

                 [/INST] To find the total time it takes to warm up the oil and cook the chicken, we need to find the time it takes for each step and add them together.

1. Warming up the oil: it takes 20 minutes.
2. Heating the oil to 400 degrees: After reaching 300 degrees, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. So, we need to find 40% of 20 minutes: (0.4) * 20 = 8 minutes.
	Therefore, the total time to heat oil up to 400 degrees is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.
3. Cooking the chicken: after heating the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Therefore, the time to cook the chicken is 20 - 5 = 15 minutes.

Thus, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 28 + 15 = {The final answer is 43 minutes.}</s>","It takes 20*.4=8 more minutes to go from 300 to 400 degrees than from room temperature to 300

For newspaper ads: Cost = $5 per ad
For television ads: Cost = $75 per ad

Step 2: Find the total cost of all the newspaper ads.
Number of newspaper ads = 50
Total cost of newspaper ads = Number of ads * Cost per ad
Total cost of newspaper ads = 50 * $5
Total cost of newspaper ads = $250

Step 3: Find the total cost of all the television ads.
Number of television ads = 15
Total cost of television ads = Number of ads * Cost per ad
Total cost of television ads = 15 * $75
Total cost of television ads = $1125

1. We have 2 houses, and each house has 3 bedrooms. So, the total number of bedrooms is 2 houses * 3 bedrooms/house = 6 bedrooms.
2. Each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows for all the bedrooms is 6 bedrooms * 2 windows/bedroom = 12 windows/house * 2 houses = 24 windows.
3. Each house also has an additional 4 windows that are not connected to bedrooms. So, the total number of windows for each house is 24 windows/house + 4 windows/house = 28 windows/house.

Therefore, the total number of windows between the two houses is 28 windows/house * 2 houses = 56 windows.

1. The mother bought cocoa for $4.20.
2. She bought laundry for $9.45.
3. And she bought a package of pasta for $1.35.

Now let's add up the costs of each item to find the total cost:

Total Cost = $4.20 (cocoa) + $9.45 (laundry) + $1.35 (pasta)
Total Cost = $14.95

Next, we need to find the difference between the total cost and the amount she paid:

Change = Total Cost - Amount Paid

However, the symbol '-' sign indicates that there is a deficit or loss, which does not make sense in this context as the mother should be receiving change and not losing money. We made an error in our calculation. The correct calculation should have given a positive value for the change amount. Therefore, we have the following error:

                 [/INST] Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We know that the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of that number, which is (1/10) * 900 = 90 stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.
4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.
5. We have accounted for 900 stitches for the body, 90 stitches for the collar, and 180 stitches for the rosette. That's a total of 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.
6. Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, we must find out how many stitches are in each sleeve.
7. We know that there are two sleeves, so the total number of stitches in both sleeves must be equal to the difference between the total number of stitches in the sweater and the number of stitches we have already accounted for: 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.
8. Therefore, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches. {The final answer is: each sleeve takes 315 stitches.}</s>","The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.

x = 2 * 54 = 108

The first scene has a third of the lines as Sean's lines, so we have:

Sean's lines in first scene = x / 3

Now let's find the number of lines in the second scene. We're given that it has six more lines than the solo song, so the number of lines in the second scene is:

x + 54 + 6 = x + 60

And four-fifths of these lines are Sean's lines, so we have:

Sean's lines in second scene = (4/5) * (x + 60)

The total number of lines Sean has to memorize is the sum of the lines in both scenes:

Total lines = Sean's lines in first scene + Sean's lines in second scene

Substituting the expressions we found earlier:

Total lines = (x / 3) + (4/5) * (x + 60)

To find the exact value, we would need to solve this equation for x. However, if we want to find a reasonable approximation, we can notice that the first scene has significantly more lines than the second scene, and the percentage of Sean's lines in the second scene is higher than in the first scene. Therefore, a reasonable approximate answer is:

{The final answer is: Approximately 3 times the number of lines in the solo song (162 lines).}</s>","The first scene has twice the number of lines as his solo song, so it has 2 * 54 = <<2*54=108>>108 lines.

                    question:
                    It takes . Matthew ? 3 minutes to dig a small hole for shrubs and ? 10 minutes to ; dig ? a ! large hole for trees.  How many hours will it ; take him to dig : 30 small holes and : 15 ! large : holes?
                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first need to find out how long it takes him to dig one small hole and one large hole. Then we can multiply that time by the number of holes of each type.

We know that:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole.
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig a large hole.

Let's calculate how long it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes:
Time to dig 30 small holes = Time to dig one small hole * Number of small holes
Time to dig 30 small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes
Time to dig 30 small holes = 90 minutes

Now let's convert minutes to hours: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

So, Matthew takes 1.5 hours to dig 30 small holes.

Similarly, let's calculate how long it takes Matthew to dig 15 large holes:
Time to dig 15 large holes = Time to dig one large hole * Number of large holes
Time to dig 15 large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes
Time to dig 15 large holes = 150 minutes

Now let's convert minutes to hours: 150 minutes = 2.5 hours

So, Matthew takes 2.5 hours to dig 15 large holes.

To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig both types of holes, we add the time it takes to dig all the small holes to the time it takes to dig all the large holes:

Total time = Time to dig small holes + Time to dig large holes
Total time = 1.5 hours (for small holes) + 2.5 hours (for large holes)
Total time = 4 hours

{The final answer is: Matthew will take 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.}</s>","It takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and he needs to dig 30 small holes so it will take 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 minutes
It takes 10 minutes to dig a large hole and he needs to dig 15 large holes so it will take him 15*10 = <<10*15=150>>150 minutes
It will take 90 minutes to dig the small holes and 150 minutes to dig the large holes for a total of 90+150 = <<90+150=240>>240 minutes
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour and he needs to dig for 240 minutes so that's 240/60 = <<240/60=4>>4 hours

                 [/INST] To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to find their current ages based on the given information that their ages add up to 20. We can solve this problem by using the following steps:

Step 1: Let's assume Mico's age is X. Then Marco's age would be (20-X).

Step 2: In 10 years, Mico's age will be (X+10), and Marco's age will be ((20-X)+10).

Step 3: We can write the equation for the sum of their ages in the present and in 10 years as follows:

X + (20-X) = 20
3X = 20
X = 20/3

Oops! Our assumption for Mico's age, X, led to an unusual result. Since we cannot have a fraction of an age, there must be a mistake in our assumptions. Let's try another approach.

Step 1: Instead, let's assume Mico's age is Y, and Marco's age is (20-Y).

Step 2: In 10 years, Mico's age will be (Y+10), and Marco's age will be ((20-Y)+10).

Step 3: Let's write the equation for the sum of their ages in the present and in 10 years:

Y + (20-Y) = 20
Y + 20 - Y = 20
20 = 2Y
Y = 10

Step 4: Therefore, Mico's age is 10, and Marco's age is (20-10) = 10.

Step 5: In 10 years, Mico's age will be (10+10) = 20, and Marco's age will be ((20-10)+10) = 30.

The final answer is that Mico will be 20 years old, and Marco will be 30 years old, in 10 years.</s>","There will be an additional 10 (for Mico) + 10 9for Marco) = <<10+10=20>>20 to Mico and Marco's current sum of ages in 10 years.

                    question:
                    Ruby is 6 times older ; than Sam. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. How old is Sam now?
                 [/INST] To find Sam's current age, we need to set up two equations based on the given information and then solve them simultaneously.

Let's denote Sam's current age as S. Then, Ruby's current age is 6S (since she is 6 times older than Sam).

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:

6S + 9 = 3 * (S + 9)

Now, we'll solve this equation:

First, get all the ""S"" variables on one side:

5S + 9 = 3S + 9

Subtract 9 from both sides:

5S = 3S + 0

S = 2S

Subtract S from both sides:

4S = 0

Divide both sides by 4:

S = 0 / 4

This result doesn't make sense, so let's try to find the error in our assumptions or calculations.

Upon closer inspection, we assumed that the ""S"" in the second equation referred to Sam's age in the future (S + 9). However, in reality, this ""S"" should refer to Sam's current age as well (since both Ruby and Sam have the same ""S"" variable to represent their ages).

With that correction, our equation now becomes:

6S + 9 = 3 * S + 9

Subtract 9 from both sides:

5S = 2S + 0

S = 3S

Subtract S from both sides:

4S = 0

Divide both sides by 4:

S = 0 / 4

This result is still invalid. Let's go back and check our calculations:

5S = 2S + 9

Subtract 2S from both sides:

3S = 9

Divide both sides by 3:

S = 3

So, Sam's current age is 3.

Therefore, the final answer is that Sam is currently 3 years old.</s>","Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.
In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
We simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.
Now we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's find out how many spots a mamba has. We know that a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has half as many spots as a mamba. So, we can write the equation:

70 (spots on one cobra) = 2 * (number of spots on one mamba)

Solving for the number of spots on one mamba:

Number of spots on one mamba = 70 / 2 = 35

Step 2: Since there are 40 cobras, the total number of spots on all cobras is 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots.

Step 3: There are 60 mambas, so the total number of spots on all mambas is 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots.

Step 4: To find the total number of spots on all snakes in the park, add the number of spots on all cobras and the number of spots on all mambas: 2800 spots (on cobras) + 2100 spots (on mambas) = 4900 spots.

First, let's calculate the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:

Number of stars in 3 rows of 8 = 3 * 8 = 24
Number of stars in 2 rows of 6 = 2 * 6 = 12

Next, let's find the total number of stars on the flag:

Total number of stars = Number of stars in rows of 8 + Number of stars in rows of 6 + Number of stars in rows of 5

To find the number of stars in rows of 5, we need to find the difference between the total number of stars and the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6:

Total number of stars = 24 (rows of 8) + 12 (rows of 6) + x (rows of 5)
32 + x = 76

                    question:
                    A landscaping : company is delivering flagstones to a customer’s yard. Each flagstone , weighs 75 pounds. If the delivery trucks can carry a total weight . of 2000 pounds, how ! many trucks will be ! needed ; to transport 80 flagstones in one ? trip?
                 [/INST] To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones and then divide that weight by the weight capacity of each truck.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.
Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the weight of 80 flagstones is:
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Step 2: Determine how many trucks are needed to transport 6000 pounds.
We know that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to transport 6000 pounds, we need to divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck and round up to the nearest whole number since we can't split a truck in half.
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks (but we need 4 trips to transport all 80 flagstones)

Therefore, {The final answer is: 4 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in two trips} (Since each truck can only carry 2000 pounds and the total weight is 6000 pounds, it will take two trips to transport all 80 flagstones)

However, if you meant to ask for the number of trucks needed to transport all 80 flagstones in one trip, the answer would be 5 trucks, but that may exceed the company's capacity or budget. In that case, they would have to make multiple trips with fewer flagstones per trip to stay within their weight capacity limit.</s>","The 80 flagstones weight 75 * 80 = <<75*80=6000>>6000 pounds.
Thus, the landscaping company will need 6000 / 2000 = <<6000/2000=3>>3 trucks to transport the flagstones in one trip.

Step 2: Calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover a distance of 480 miles: time = distance / speed = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = <<480/30=16>>16 hours.

First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. We know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so:

b = a - 5

Next, we know that together they have 10 times less medals than the total number of medals given out. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as ""x."" We know that a + b = 0.1x:

a + (a - 5) = 0.1x
2a - 5 = 0.1x

To solve for ""x,"" we can first solve for ""a"" by adding 5 to both sides:

2a = 0.1x + 5
a = 0.05x + 2.5

Now we know that Ali has 0.05x + 2.5 medals and Izzy has a-5 = 0.05x-2.5 medals. The total number of medals they have is a + b = 0.1x.

Given that Ali has won 22 medals, we can find the total number of medals given out by setting a = 22 and solving for x:

- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- There are 4 adults.
- So, adults will get 6 * 4 = <<6*4=24>>24 chocolate bars.

Step 2: Find out the total number of chocolate bars left for the children.
- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- A total of 8 packets were given.

- After giving 24 chocolate bars to the adults, there are 40 - 24 = <<40-24=16>>16 chocolate bars left.

Step 3: Determine the number of chocolate bars to be given to each child.
- There are 16 chocolate bars left for the children.

2. She works between 8 a.m. and ! 11 a.m. There are three one-hour time slots in this period: 8 a.m. to 9 a.m., 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., and 10 a.m. to ! 11 a.m.

3. Susan takes a half-hour pause in between her work sessions. Therefore, she works for a total of 1 hours and 30 minutes (2 hours minus half an hour).

4. Since Susan earns $30 per hour, her total earnings for the entire 2-hour session (including both work periods) is:
$30/hour * 1 hour * 2 = $60

{The final answer is $60}.</s>","Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.

Now let's check who gets an extra point in the fourth round. Since only players with over 20 points get an extra point, none of them gets an extra point in this problem.

2. In total, they will wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.
3. Since Will bought 15 oranges, and 12 of them have been washed, there are 15 - 12 = 3 oranges left unwashed.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We know that each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal. Since there are two meals (lunch and dinner), that makes the total rice consumption per person in a day: 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.
2. There are five members in the household, so the total daily rice consumption for the household is: 0.4 kg/person * 5 people = 2 kg.
3. We are not given the number of days in a week the rice lasts for, but the problem states that they consume rice twice a day for every lunch and dinner. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can assume that they go through 2 kg of rice per week.
4. We are given a 42 kg bag of rice. To find out how many weeks it will last, we need to divide the total weight of the rice by the weekly consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg/week = 21 weeks.

{The final answer is 21 weeks}.</s>","Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.

In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.
Thus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of crates Sam sold on each day except for the closed days.
Monday and Friday were closed, so Sam didn't sell any crates on those days. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.

Crates sold on weekdays:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Step 2: Calculate the total number of crates Sam sold during the week.
Number of weekdays: 3 (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday)
Crates sold per weekday: Variable (15, 12, and 18 for this week)
Total crates sold = (Number of weekdays) x (Crates sold per weekday)
Total crates sold = 3 x (15+12+18) = 3 x 45 = 135

Step 3: Calculate how many crates Sam was off from his target.
Target crates per week = 120
Total crates sold = 135
Difference = Target crates per week - Total crates sold
Difference = 120 - 135 = -15

However, the result -15 indicates that Sam sold 15 crates less than his target. To get the actual difference, we need to add this value to the total crates sold.

Final answer: {Sam was 15 crates below his target, meaning he sold a total of 110 crates (135 sold - 15 short) during the week}.</s>","During the whole week Sam sold 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = <<15+12+18+20=65>>65 crates.

The ! bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other ! people each bid once. Carmen : bids after ? each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk ? cost her?
                 [/INST] To find out how much money Carmen spends on the antique desk, we need to determine how many times bidding occurred between Carmen and the winning bid. Since the bids increase by $50 each time and there are 4 people bidding (Carmen and 3 others), we can set up an equation:

Let x be the number of bidding rounds Carmen participates in after the opening bid.
1. Carmen bids after 3 other people, so there are 3 people bidding before her in each round.
2. Each person bids $50 more than the previous bid, so the total increase in the bids from the starting price to Carmen's winning bid is ($50 * (number of bids before Carmen's)).

Using this information, we can set up the equation:
$200 + ($50 * x) = Bidding price

Our goal is to solve for x, the number of bidding rounds Carmen participates in.

First, let's find the difference between Carmen's bid and the opening bid:

$200 + ($50 * x) - $200 = $50 * x

Dividing both sides by $50:
x = ($200 + $50x) / $50

We can simplify this equation by subtracting $200 from both sides:

$35x = $50

Next, we'll divide both sides by $10:

x = 3/2

However, we cannot have a fraction number of rounds in this scenario. This implies that the given problem might be missing some information or might not have a valid solution with the provided conditions.

Therefore, without knowing the number of rounds each person bids, we cannot determine a finite answer for how much the antique desk costs Carmen.

No final answer can be provided based on the information given in the problem.

Note: For a valid solution, a specific number of bids or rounds should be mentioned for each person, including Carmen.</s>","3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of driving miles.
John pays $2 per mile. So, the cost of driving 7500 miles/year is 7500 miles x $2/mile = $15,000/year.

Step 4: Calculate the bonus paid to the driver.
John pays a $150 bonus per month. So, he pays $150/month x 12 months/year = $1800/year.

Step 5: Find out the total amount John pays per year.
The total amount John pays per year for driving is the cost of driving miles + the driver bonus. So, $15,000/year (miles driven) + $1800/year (driver bonus) = $16,800/year.

{The final answer is $16,800/year}.</s>","He has to travel 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 miles per day

That means he pays $600*50=$<<600*50=30000>>30000 a year for miles driven
He also gives $150*12=$<<150*12=1800>>1800 a year as a bonus to his driver
So he pays $30000+$1800=$<<30000+1800=31800>>31,800 a year

1. Determine the number of sheets needed.
   Sheets needed = Total number of pages / Pages per side
   Sheets needed = 32 pages / 2 pages per side
   Sheets needed = 16 sheets

2. Since one sheet of paper is used for both sides of the folded paper, the actual number of distinct pieces of paper used will be equal to the number of sheets plus one for the outermost cover.

3. Calculate the total number of pieces of paper required.

1. There are 250 books in total.
2. Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year.
3. There are currently 50 unsold books and she sold 45 books this year.

Let's denote the number of books Elise sold in the first year as ""x"" and in the current year as ""y"". From the problem information, we know that:

x = 2 * y

Also, from the problem information, we have:

x + 45 = 250 and x = 2 * y

Solving this system of equations, we find:

x = 300 and y = 100

So, Elise sold 300 books in the first year and 100 books in the second year (current year).

To find the total amount of money she earned, we need to calculate her earnings for both years:

Total earnings = Earnings in Year 1 + Earnings in Year 2

Earnings in Year 1 = 300 books * $20/book
Earnings in Year 1 = $6000

Earnings in Year 2 = 100 books * $20/book
Earnings in Year 2 = $2000

Total earnings = $6000 + $2000
Total earnings = $8000

Therefore, the total amount of money Elise earned is $8000. {The final answer is $8000}.</s>","If her sales in the current year are 45, she sold 45*2 = <<45*2=90>>90 books in the first year.
The total number of books sold in the first and current year is 90+45 = <<90+45=135>>135.
The total number of books sold in the second year is 250 of the original number of books - 135 sold books - 50 unsold books = <<250-135-50=65>>65 books.

Watson works 10 hours a day, so in a week (5 days), he works for a total of 5 * 10 = <<5*10=50>>50 hours.
His hourly wage is $10, so his weekly salary is 50 hours * $10/hour = $<<50*10=500>>500.

Step 2: Calculate Watson's monthly salary (assuming 4 weeks in April)
Since there are usually 4 weeks in a month (except for February in a leap year), Watson's monthly salary is 4 weeks * $500/week = $<<4*500=2000>>2000.

Step 3: Calculate Watson's bonus in April (assuming the company performed very well for the whole month)
The problem states that Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, so if the company performed very well for the whole month (four weeks), Watson would receive a $300 bonus for each of the four weeks, totaling $300 * 4 = $<<300*4=1200>>1200.

Step 4: Calculate Watson's total earnings in April
To find Watson's total earnings in April, we add his monthly salary to his bonus: $2000 (monthly salary) + $1200 (bonus) = $<<2000+1200=3200>>3200.

{The final answer is $3200}</s>","In a day, Watson makes 10 * 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100

Since he makes $100 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 20 * 100= $<<20*100=2000>>2000.
He also got a 300 * 4 = $<<300*4=1200>>1200 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of April.

People John won against = 16

Now, to find out how many people John lost to, we can subtract the number of people he won against from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

Two-thirds of 60 loaves are sold in the morning. So,
Number of loaves sold in the morning = (2/3) * 60
= 40

Step 2: Find out how many loaves are left after the morning sale.
Total number of loaves produced = 60
Number of loaves sold in the morning = 40
So, Number of loaves left = Total number of loaves produced - Number of loaves sold in the morning
= 60 - 40
= 20

Step 3: Find out how many loaves are sold in each session in the afternoon and evening.
Half of the loaves left are sold in the afternoon and the other half are sold in the evening. So,
Number of loaves sold in each session = Half of the remaining loaves

Step 4: Find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon.
In the problem, the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. This statement implies that the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening is the same. So,

1. We know that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.
2. Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey but needs 4 weeks to lose that amount.
3. This means that Sandy loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks as well.
4. Since Sandy takes 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 1 week, it means that Sandy loses half the amount of weight that Joey loses in a week.
5. Therefore, it takes Sandy twice as long to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.
6. If it takes Sandy 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds, then it would take Sandy twice that time, or 8 weeks, to lose 16 pounds (which is the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks).

Step 1: Find the original price of one tub of ice cream. We know that one tub costs $13.

Step 2: Find the saving on each tub. We know that each tub is now sold for $11, so the saving on each tub is $13 - $11 = $2.

Step 3: Find the original price of one packet of milk. We are not given this information directly, but we know that each packet was sold at a discount of $0.5. Therefore, the original price of one packet must be $0.5 more than the selling price. Since we don't know the selling price, we can't find the original price of one packet directly.

Step 4: Find the saving on each packet. We know that the saving on each packet is $0.5.

Step 5: Calculate the savings from buying one tub of ice cream. Savings from one tub = $2.

Step 6: Calculate the savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream. Total savings from 2 tubs = 2 * Savings from one tub = 2 * $2 = $4.

Step 7: Calculate the savings from buying one packet of milk. Savings from one packet = $0.5.

Step 8: Calculate the savings from buying 4 packets of milk. Total savings from 4 packets = 4 * Savings from one packet = 4 * $0.5 = $2.

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the number of new limbs that will grow after 15 days:

First, we need to figure out how many new arms and legs will grow every 3 days (arms) and 5 days (legs).

1. Arms grow every 3 days: We'll calculate how many arms will grow in total in 15 days. Since there are two arms per day (one for each hand), and arms grow every 3 days, we need to calculate this:
   Number of arms = (Number of days / Days to grow one arm) * 2
   Number of arms = (15 days / 3 days) * 2
   Number of arms = 5 * 2 = 10 arms

2. Legs grow every 5 days: We'll apply the same logic to find out how many legs will grow in total in 15 days. Since there are two legs per day (one for each leg), and legs grow every 5 days, we need to calculate this:
   Number of legs = (Number of days / Days to grow one leg) * 2
   Number of legs = (15 days / 5 days) * 2
   Number of legs = 3 * 2 = 6 legs

Now let's check that both answers make sense. Based on our calculation, a person will grow:
10 arms and 6 legs

{The final answer is: The serum will cause a person to grow 10 extra arms and 6 extra legs.}

Although the situation in this question is quite bizarre, with this mathematical process, we have arrived at the expected number of new limbs. Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum indeed seems to generate quite some unique growth patterns!</s>","At one new arm every 3 days, after 15 days, a person who drank Helena’s serum would grow 15 / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 extra arms.
At one new leg every 5 days, after 15 days, the person would grow 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 extra legs.
In all, someone who drank Helena’s serum would grow 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 new limbs after 15 days.

                 [/INST] To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts for his business partners, we first need to determine how much he has spent on other expenses for the trip.

1. Theo spends $6000 in total for the trip. He buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so the cost of business suits is 6 * $100 = $600. He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so the cost of suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150.

2. The cost of a flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Let's represent the cost of a business suit by x. Then, the cost of the flight ticket is 5x + $700. Since the cost of a business suit is $100, the cost of the flight ticket is 5 * $100 + $700 = $600 + $700 = $1300.

3. Theo spends $600 on business suits, $150 on suitcases, and $1300 on a flight ticket, so the total amount he has spent till now is $600 + $150 + $1300 = $1950.

4. Theo wishes to save $2000 for this trip, so he still needs to spend $2000 - $1950 = $50 on the trip, which is irrelevant for this problem, since we're trying to find out how much he has to spend on gifts.

5. Theo has spent $1950 on other expenses for the trip, so he has $6000 - $1950 = $4050 left to spend on gifts.

                    question:
                    In a family of 5, three people eat three , eggs each day : while the rest eat two eggs each day. If they eat eggs every day, how ? many eggs will the family consume in a week?
                 [/INST] To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we need to first determine how many eggs each person eats daily, and then calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week.

1. Three people in the family eat three eggs each day. So, the number of eggs consumed by these three people daily is: 3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs/day
2. The remaining two people in the family eat two eggs each day. So, the number of eggs consumed by these two people daily is: 2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs/day
3. The total number of eggs consumed daily by the family is: 9 eggs/day (from the first group) + 4 eggs/day (from the second group) = 13 eggs/day
4. To find out how many eggs are consumed in a week, we need to multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week, which is 7: 13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs/week

{The final answer is: The family consumes 91 eggs in a week.}</s>","Three persons eat 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs each day.
So, 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 persons eat two eggs in a day.
Thus, 2 x 2 = 4 eggs are consumed by the two other people in a day.
So the family consumes 9 + 4 = <<9+4=13>>13 eggs each day.
Therefore, 13 x 7 = <<13*7=91>>91 eggs will be consumed by the family in a week.

                 [/INST] To find the age of Trent, we need to use the given relationships between their ages:

1. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Quinn is older than Jane by 3 years. We can represent this as Quinn = Jane + 3.
2. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is older than Jane by 5 years. We can represent this as Trent = Jane + 5.
3. We're given that Quinn is 30 years old.

Now we can set up two equations using the given information and solve for Trent's age.

First, let's find Jane's age:
Since Quinn = Jane + 3 and Quinn = 30, then Jane = Quinn - 3 = 27.

Next, let's find Trent's age:

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.So, Noah's age was (0.5) * (Cera's age six years ago).
2. The population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. So, the population six years ago was (0.5) * (Current population of Chile).
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age six years ago. So, (3000 * Noah's age six years ago) = (0.5 * Current population of Chile).
4. From Step 1, Noah's age six years ago was (0.5) * (Cera's age six years ago).
5. From Steps 2 and 3, we can set up the following equation: (3000 * (0.5 * Cera's age six years ago)) = (0.5 * Current population of Chile).
6. To solve for the current population of Chile, we would need to find Cera's age six years ago and then solve for the current population using the equation from Step 5.
7. We know Cera is currently 46 years old. From Step 1, Noah's age six years ago was (0.5) * (46). So, Noah's age six years ago was 23 years.
8. Now we have enough information to find the current population of Chile. However, without knowing specific values for Cera's age six years ago or the ratio of Chile's population growth between then and now, we cannot determine an exact numerical answer.

The final answer is: We cannot calculate the exact population of Chile now with the given information.</s>","If Cera is 46 years old now, she was 46-6 = <<46-6=40>>40 years old six years ago.

If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, there were 3000*20 = <<3000*20=60000>>60000 people living in chile.

                 [/INST] Let's reason through this problem step by step:

1. We know that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense. So, if there are x players on the defense, then there are 2x players on the offense.
2. We also know that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. So, if there are x players on the defense, then there are 0.5x players on the special teams.
3. The total number of players on the team is given as 105. So, we have: x (defense) + x (offense) + 0.5x (special teams) = 105
4. We can substitute x (offense) with 2x, since there are twice as many players on offense as on defense: x + 2x + 0.5x = 105
5. Combining the terms, we get: 3x = 105

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.

Step 2: Calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father.
We know Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.
First, let's find out how many marbles Solomon bought from Johanna: 20 marbles.
Now, we know that Solomon received 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, so we calculate the number of marbles he received from his father:
Num marbles from father = (2/5) * Num marbles from Johanna
Num marbles from father = (2/5) * 20 marbles
Num marbles from father = 12 marbles

Step 3: Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store.
Total marbles = Marbles from Johanna + Marbles from father
Total marbles = 20 marbles + 12 marbles
Total marbles = 32 marbles

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the marbles.
Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:

Volume = Length * Width * Depth
Volume = 6 ft * 4 ft * 5 ft
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Step 2: Calculate the cost of filling the pool.
Cost per cubic foot = $0.1

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of girls in the classroom as x. Then we know that there are 3 times as many girls as boys, so there are 3x boys. We also know that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys, so there are x/10 nongendered children.

First, let's find the number of girls in terms of the number of boys, which we know is 30:

x = 3 * number of boys
x = 3 * 30
x = 90

Now we know that there are 90 girls and 30 boys, so the total number of children in the classroom is:

Total children = Girls + Boys + Nongendered
Total children = 90 + 30 + x/10

To find the value of x/10, we need to find the number of nongendered children:

x/10 = Number of nongendered children
x = 10 * Number of nongendered children
x = 10N

Substituting this back into our equation for total children:

Total children = 90 + 30 + (10N)/10
Total children = 90 + 30 + N

So the total number of children in the classroom is:

                 [/INST] To find the total number of electric poles required, we first need to find out how many electric poles are needed for each wire. Since the ratio of electric poles to wires is 1:3, we can represent this as 1 pole per group of 3 wires:

1 electric pole : 3 electric wires

Now we know that there are a total of 45 electric wires needed in the neighborhood. Let's find out how many groups of 3 wires this represents and then determine how many poles are required to support those groups:

Total number of groups of 3 wires = Total number of electric wires / Number of wires per group
Group count = 45 wires / 3 wires per group = 15 groups

Given that 1 pole supports 3 wires, the total number of poles required is equal to the number of groups:

Total number of electric poles = Total number of groups of electric wires
Total number of electric poles = 15 groups

The total number of people = Number of men + Number of women
Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women
Total number of people = 40

Step 2: Determine the number of people left after 1 hour.
We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left after an hour.

Number of people left = Total number of people * (3/4)
Number of people left = 40 * (3/4)
Number of people left = 30

Step 3: Determine the number of men left after 1 hour.
We're told that 22 men stayed at the party.

Step 4: Determine the number of women left after 1 hour.
Since we know the number of men left and the original number of women, we can find the number of women left by subtracting the number of men left from the original total number of people and then subtracting the number of women who left during the hour.

Number of women left = Total number of people - Number of men left - Number of women who left
Number of women left = 40 - 22 - 15/2 (since 1/4 of the women left)

Note: In the above step, we divided the number of women who left by 2 because the problem states ""an hour"" but it doesn't specify if it's a whole hour or not. If we consider it to be a whole hour, there would be 15 women who left, if not, there would be 7 women who left.

There are 13 women left at the party.

If considering less than an hour passed and 7 women left the party:

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Jam has three boxes full of pencils, and there are also 2 loose pencils. So, the number of pencils Jam has is:
   Number of pencils Jam has = Number of pencils in boxes + Loose pencils
   = 3 boxes * Number of pencils in each box + 2

2. The problem states that the number of pencils in the boxes and the loose pencils together totals 26. Therefore:
   3 boxes * Number of pencils in each box + 2 = 26

3. To find the number of pencils in each box, let's first solve for the number of boxes. Since 3 multiplied by an unknown number equals 26, we have:
   3 * Number of boxes = 26
   Number of boxes = 26 / 3 = 8.66 (approximately)
   Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we'll round up and assume that Jam has 9 boxes in total.

4. So, the number of pencils in each box is:
   Number of pencils in each box = 26 - 2 (loose pencils) / 9 (number of boxes)
   = 2 (approximately)

5. Now, we know that Jam has 9 boxes with 2 loose pencils and 2 boxes filled with 2 approximated pencils each. So, Jam has:
   = 9 boxes * (2 loose pencils + 2 approximated pencils)
   = 9 boxes * 4
   = 36 pencils

6. Jam has 36 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of boxes they need to store all their pencils, we can add the number of pencils Jam has and the number of pencils Meg has:
   Total number of pencils = Jam's pencils + Meg's pencils
   = 36 + 46
   = 82

7. To find the number of boxes they need to store all their pencils, we'll divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils we can store in one box:
   Number of boxes = Total number of pencils / Number of pencils in each box
   = 82 / 2
   = 41

Since we can't store a fraction of a box, they'll need to get at least 42 boxes to store all their pencils. {The final answer is 42 boxes}.</s>","There are a total of 26 - 2 = <<26-2=24>>24 pencils in the three boxes.

                    , Shannon ! makes herself iced coffee ! by brewing hot coffee and adding ice cubes. Each : ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees but makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Any , added liquid also weakens : the coffee. How many milliliters weaker ; is Shannon’s , iced : coffee when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream?
                 [/INST] To find out how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is after cooling it by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the effect of ice cubes on the coffee
- Shannon adds ice cubes to cool the coffee by 65 degrees (65 x 13 = 855 degrees)
- Each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 ml
- Since 65 degrees requires adding n ice cubes to achieve that temperature decrease (n = 65/13 = 5.08 → 6 ice cubes)
- Therefore, 6 ice cubes make the coffee weaker by 6 x 12 = 72 ml

Step 2: Add the volume of water from the brewed coffee
- We don't have the information about the volume of coffee Shannon starts with, so let's assume she brews 250 ml of coffee
- Then, the initial coffee volume is 250 ml

Step 3: Calculate the impact of added cream
- Shannon adds 15 ml of cream to her iced coffee
- Therefore, the coffee is 15 ml weaker

Step 4: Find the final volume of the coffee
- Initial coffee volume was 250 ml
- Ice cubes weakened it by 72 ml
- Added cream weakened it by 15 ml
- So, the final coffee volume is 250 ml - 72 ml - 15 ml = 227 ml

{The final answer is: Shannon's iced coffee is 53 ml weaker.}</s>","Shannon’s iced coffee has 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes in it.
The ice makes the coffee 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 milliliters weaker.
After adding cream, Shannon’s iced coffee is 60 + 15 = <<60+15=75>>75 milliliters weaker.

                 [/INST] Let's work through this problem step by step:

1. We know that people can trade 2 old records for 1 new record at Ralph's record store.
2. Five people come in and leave with a total of 7 new records between them.
3. To find out how many old records the 5 people brought in, we first need to determine how many old records they traded for those new records.
4. For every new record they leave with, they must have traded in 2 old records.
5. Let x be the number of old records each person brought in.
6. The total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is 5 * x.
7. The total number of new records they left with is 7.
8. The number of new records they brought in (which is the same as the number of old records they traded away) is x, since they traded 2 old records for each new one.
9. Thus, the number of new records they left with is equal to the number of old records they brought in, so x = 7 (this is actually not possible because each person can't bring in 7 old records, but assuming that's a mistake in the question and it should be 5 old records for each new one).
10. Therefore, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is 5 * x = 5 * 7 = 35.

But since each person can only bring in 2 old records for each new one they get, it is not possible for 5 people to collectively bring in 35 old records. So, there is an error in the problem statement.

Final answer: The problem contains an error and cannot be solved as stated.

{The final answer is: The problem contains an error and cannot be solved as stated.}</s>","People can bring in 2 old records = get 1 new record.
5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records, 7 new records x 2 old records traded for each = <<7*2=14>>14 old records that the 5 people brought in.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. ; If the number ; of Junior programmers ! is 2/5 of the total number of employees, . and they are each paid $2000 per month, calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of junior programmers.
Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can set up the equation:
junior_programmers = (2/5) * total_employees

Step 2: Calculate the total number of employees.
Since there are currently 100 employees in the company, we have:
total_employees = 100

Step 3: Determine the number of junior programmers.
Substitute the value of total_employees into the equation from Step 1:
junior_programmers = (2/5) * 100
junior_programmers = 40

Step 4: Determine the monthly salary of senior programmers.
Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers; therefore, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is:
senior_salary = junior_salary + $400
senior_salary = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Step 5: Determine the monthly salary of junior programmers.
Given that junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, the monthly salary of a junior programmer remains $2000.

Step 6: Determine the total amount of money paid to junior programmers per month.
junior_payroll = number_of_junior_programmers * junior_salary
junior_payroll = 40 * $2000
junior_payroll = $80,000

Step 7: Determine the total amount of money paid to senior programmers per month.
Since there are 60 senior programmers (100 total employees minus 40 junior programmers), the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
senior_payroll = number_of_senior_programmers * senior_salary
senior_payroll = 60 * $2400
senior_payroll = $144,000

Step 8: Determine the total amount of money paid to all programmers per month.
total_payroll = junior_payroll + senior_payroll
total_payroll = $80,000 + $144,000
total_payroll = $224,000

The final answer is: The company pays a total of $224,000 per month to all the programmers.</s>","The number of junior programmers in the company is 2/5*100 = <<2/5*100=40>>40
The total amount of money that the company pays to the Junior employees is $2000*40 = $<<2000*40=80000>>80000
There are also 100-40 = <<100-40=60>>60 senior programmers in the company.
The senior programmers are paid $2000+$400 = $<<2000+400=2400>>2400 each.

At the first stop, 5 more people got on the bus, so the total number of people on the bus became x + 5.

At the second stop, 7 people got off the bus, leaving x + 5 - 7 = x + 2 people on the bus.

At the second stop, 8 more people got on the bus, so the total number of people on the bus became x + 2 + 8 = x + 10.

We know that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop on the bus, so we can set up the equation x + 10 = 20.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to charge the phone from 60% to 100%. To do this, we need to find out how many percentage points are missing and then calculate how long it takes to charge that many points.

First, let's find out how many percentage points are missing:
100% - 60% = 40 percentage points

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to charge 40 percentage points:
40 percentage points * 3 minutes per percentage point = 120 minutes

Now, we need to convert this time from minutes to hours. We know that:
1 hour = 60 minutes

So, 120 minutes = 120 / 60 hours = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone.

1. First, let's calculate the rewards earned from the current shopping trip, where the customer spent $43. Rewards are earned at a rate of $1 off per $20 spent.

Rewards earned = Spending amount / Reward rate
Rewards earned = $43 / $20
Rewards earned = 2.15
Since rewards are earned in whole dollar amounts, the customer would actually earn 2 rewards.

2. Next, let's calculate the number of rewards redeemed in this shopping trip. The customer used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price.

Rewards redeemed = 2 * Rewards earned
Rewards redeemed = 2 * 2
Rewards redeemed = 4

3. To find out how much the rewards reduced the price of their shopping trip, we can calculate the value of the rewards redeemed. Rewards are worth $1 off per reward, so:

Value of rewards = Rewards redeemed * Value per reward
Value of rewards = 4 * $1
Value of rewards = $4

4. Lastly, we need to find out the total amount the customer paid on this shopping trip after accounting for their rewards and the coupon. We can find this by first calculating their spending amount after applying the coupon, then adding the value of the rewards.

Spending amount after rewards = Spending amount + Value of rewards
Spending amount after rewards = $43 + $4
Spending amount after rewards = $47

{The final answer is $47}.</s>","The customer had 80 / 20 = $<<80/20=4>>4 in rewards.

Job A:
Annual wage = $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000
Taxes = 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
Net income = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
Annual wage = $42,000
Taxes = 10% of ($42,000 - $6,000) = $4,200
Property tax = $6,000
Total taxes = $6,000 + $4,200 = $10,200
Net income = $42,000 - $10,200 = $31,800

Now, let's find the difference in net pay between the two jobs:

                    Nick, Richard, Jason and DJ each have paintball guns. DJ has 8 guns, Nick ! has 10 guns, , RJ has 1 gun and Richard . has 5 guns. If they ! were to share their ; guns equally, how , many guns would each of them have?
                 [/INST] To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared their guns equally, we first need to find out the total number of guns and then divide that number by the number of people to find out how many guns each person would get on average.

1. The total number of guns that Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ have are:
Nick has 10 guns
Richard has 5 guns
Jason has ! guns (There is a missing number here, we need to find out how many guns Jason has)
DJ has 8 guns

To find out how many guns Jason has, we can simply read the given information again:
Jason has ! guns

So, the total number of guns is 10 (Nick's) + 5 (Richard's) + ! (Jason's) + 8 (DJ's) = **< 13 >**

2. To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared their guns equally, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:
Total number of guns = < 13 >
Number of people = 4 (Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ)

So, each person would have on average:
Guns per person = Total number of guns / Number of people = 13 / 4 = **< 3.25 >**

Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a gun, let's round down to the nearest whole number:

{The final answer is: Each person would have roughly 3 guns.}

But, in reality, since one person has less than their share, the other three would need to give up some of their guns for everyone to have an equal number. The actual number of guns each person would have depends on how much they're willing to give up, so the value of 3 guns per person is just an approximation in this case.</s>","The total number of guns is 8+10+1+5=<<8+10+1+5=24>>24 guns.

1. Sugar for 8 batches of suckers: 30 ounces per batch * 8 batches = 240 ounces
2. Sugar for 1 batch of fudge: 70 ounces per batch = 70 ounces

Now, we add the amount of sugar needed for all the batches together.

Total sugar needed = Sugar for suckers + Sugar for fudge

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds. We'll label this as F (for frog).

2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog. So, the weight of the blue beetle is also 50 pounds. We'll label this as B (for beetle).

3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog. So, the weight of the green toad is also 50 pounds. We'll label this as T (for toad).

4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds less than the pink frog. So, the weight of the yellow snake is 40 pounds. We'll label this as S (for snake).

5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog. So, the weight of the red bird is 30 pounds. We'll label this as R (for bird).

6. Now, add up the weights of all the animals to find the total weight of the container.
   Total weight = F (pink frog) + B (blue beetle) + T (green toad) + S (yellow snake) + R (red bird)
            = 50 + 50 + 50 + 40 + 30

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Tyson runs 5000 meters every day.
2. His coach advises him to run 1/5 times more meters every day. That means, Tyson would need to run 5 * 5000 = 25,000 meters every day.
3. To find the total distance covered in a month, we need to multiply the daily distance by the number of days in a month (30 days).
4. So, Tyson would cover a total of 25,000 meters/day * 30 days = 750,000 meters in a month.
5. To convert meters to kilometers, we know that 1 kilometer = 1000 meters. So, 750,000 meters = 750 kilometers.

Therefore, the final answer is: {Tyson would cover a total distance of 750 kilometers in June if he followed his coach's advice and trained every day for a month.}</s>","Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 * 5000 meters = <<5000/5=1000>>1000 more meters per day.

                    Davos bought 2 shirts from the mall that , cost $30 each. If he , bought them with a ? 40% discount, how much did Davos pay for the 2 shirts?
                 [/INST] To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts with a 40% discount, let's first find out the discounted price of each shirt, and then we'll multiply that by the number of shirts.

Step 1: Discounted price of one shirt = Original price * (1 - Discount rate)
Discounted price of one shirt = $30 * (1 - 0.4)
Discounted price of one shirt = $30 * 0.6
Discounted price of one shirt = $18

Step 2: Total cost of 2 shirts with a 40% discount = Discounted price of one shirt * Number of shirts
Total cost of 2 shirts with a 40% discount = $18 * 2
Total cost of 2 shirts with a 40% discount = $36

{The final answer is: $36.}</s>","The total price of the 2 shirts is $30 x 2 = $<<30*2=60>>60.
The total discount on the 2 shirts is $60 x 0.40 = $<<60*0.40=24>>24.
Therefore, the total amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is $60 - $24 = $<<60-24=36>>36.

                 [/INST] To find the percentage increase in daily revenue, we first need to calculate the daily revenue for both the tractor production and the silo production.

Step 1: Calculate daily revenue for tractor production.
They sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor: Daily revenue for tractor production = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

Step 2: Calculate daily revenue for silo production.
They sell 5 silos a day and make $220 per silo: Daily revenue for silo production = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

Step 3: Compare the daily revenues and find the percentage increase.
Percentage increase = [(New daily revenue - Old daily revenue) / Old daily revenue] * 100%

Let's calculate the percentage increase:
Percentage increase = [($1100/day - $1000/day) / $1000/day] * 100%

First, subtract the old daily revenue from the new daily revenue: $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day

Next, divide the difference by the old daily revenue: $100/day / $1000/day = 0.1

Finally, multiply 0.1 by 100%: 0.1 * 100% = 10%

So, {The final answer is: they are making 10% more per day now}.</s>","They used to make $1,000 a day because 10 x 100 = <<10*100=1000>>1,000

How many hours ! will all Peyton’s ! after-work activities take?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the duration of Tuesday's cooking class. Since it lasts three times as long as Monday's yoga class, and Monday's yoga class lasts 1 hour, we have:

Duration of Tuesday's cooking class = 1 hour (Monday's yoga) × 3

Duration of Tuesday's cooking class = 3 hours

Step 2: Calculate the duration of Thursday's museum tour. Since it takes half as long as the cooking class, and the cooking class lasts 3 hours, we have:

Duration of Thursday's museum tour = 3 hours (Tuesday's cooking class) × 0.5

Duration of Thursday's museum tour = 1.5 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities. We have:

Total hours = Monday's yoga (1 hour) + Tuesday's cooking class (3 hours) + Wednesday's cheese-tasting event (0.5 hours) + Thursday's museum tour (1.5 hours) + Friday's errands (2 hours)

Total hours = 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 + 0.5 = 8.5 hours

April had already bought 100 plant pots from ? the garden center ? before she knew how many she needed. How many ? plant pots does April have left over?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of plant pots April has bought for daisies and roses at the school.
- The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies.
- They asked for twice as many plant pots for the roses.

Since they asked for twice as many plant pots for the roses as they did for the daisies:
- Roses require 30 plant pots * 2 = 60 plant pots

Step 2: Determine the total number of plant pots April has bought.
- April bought 100 plant pots before she knew how many were needed.
- She bought 30 plant pots for the daisies.
- She bought 60 plant pots for the roses.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of plant pots April has.
- Total plant pots = 100 (pots April bought at the garden center) + 30 (pots for daisies) + 60 (pots for roses)

Step 4: Determine the number of plant pots April has left over.
- Left over plant pots = Total plant pots - Number of plant pots used

1. We know that Andrea had $36 in the beginning.
2. She spent some amount of money on savings and then spent $11 on the sweater and gave $4 to her brother.
3. So, the total amount of money Andrea spent can be calculated as: $36 - (amount saved) - $11 - $4
4. We want to find out how much Andrea saved, so we need to find the value of ""amount saved"" in the above equation.
5. Setting up an equation, we have: amount saved = $36 - ($11 + $4)
6. Simplifying the right side of the equation, we have: amount saved = $36 - $15
7. Therefore, amount saved = $21.

The final answer is: Andrea saved $21.</s>","Andrea spent and gave her brother a total of $11 + $4 = $<<11+4=15>>15.

1. Boating: 6 hours
2. Swimming: 6 hours * 0.5 = 3 hours
3. Swimming and boating: 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours

John spent 9 hours on boating and swimming. Now let's find out how long he spent watching shows.

4. Shows: 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

According to the problem, 30% of John's vacation time was spent watching shows. Therefore, we'll determine how much time he spent on sightseeing by finding the time difference between the total vacation time and the time spent on the other activities.

Let T represent the total time John spent on vacation (in hours). We know that:

9 hours (Boating and Swimming) + 6 hours (Shows) = 0.7 * T

Now we can set up an equation to determine T.

T = 9 + 6
T = 15 hours

John spent a total of 15 hours on his activities. We know he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, which is equal to 0.4 * 15 hours = 6 hours.

So, {The final answer is: John spent 6 hours sightseeing}.</s>","He spent 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours swimming
He spent 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 hours watching shows

                    Carver just ! turned 45 years old, which makes him ? 5 . years , less than twice the age of his son.  How old is his son, in , years?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Carver's age is currently 45 years.

Step 2: Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. Let's denote the son's age as ""x"" years. According to the problem, we can write the equation: 45 = 2x - 5.

Step 3: To find the son's age, we need to solve the above equation. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation to get 45 = 2x. Then, divide both sides by 2: 22.5 = x. Since we cannot have a half-year age, we'll adjust the result accordingly: x = 23 or x = 22 (round down or round up, depending on the specific situation).

Step 4: Given Carver's age of 45 and the son's age of 23, the equation is satisfied.

The final answer is: Carver's son is 23 years old.</s>","Let x be the age of Carver's son.
Since Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, then 45=(2*x)-5.
Add 5 to each side of the equation and we get 50=2*x.
Thus, the age of Carver's son is x=25 years old.

                 [/INST] First, let's find the total distance traveled by the train in one trip: 75 miles (from City 1 to City 2) + 100 miles (from City 2 to City 3) + (50 miles less than 100 miles) (from City 3 to City 1) = 225 miles (since 100 miles - 50 miles = 50 miles).

Next, we need to determine how many miles the train travels in a day. Since the train makes three trips per day, we can find the daily distance by multiplying the trip distance by three: 225 miles * 3 trips = 675 miles per day.

To find out how many days the train can travel before needing service, we divide the total miles it travels between services by its daily distance: 18,000 miles / 675 miles per day = approximately 26.3 days. Since trains cannot operate for a fraction of a day, we round up to the next full day:

Therefore, the train goes between approximately 27 days without requiring service. {The final answer is approximately 27 days}.</s>","It takes 100+75=<<100+75=175>>175 miles for the first two legs of the trip

So the total trip is 175+125=<<175+125=300>>300 miles
So it goes 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 miles per day

                 [/INST] To find out how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds, we first need to determine the amount of stuffing required for each type of bed.

1. A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
2. A bed for a Chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
3. The average amount of stuffing for a Chihuahua and a Collie bed is between 2 and 8 pounds.

Let's assume the average amount of stuffing for a Collie bed is 6 pounds. This makes the difference between a Rottweiler and a Collie bed 6 pounds: 8 - 2 = 6 pounds.

Now let's calculate the amount of stuffing required for 4 Chihuahua beds and 3 Collie beds:

1. Stuffing for 4 Chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds
2. Stuffing for 3 Collie beds: 3 * 6 = 18 pounds
3. Total amount of stuffing required: 8 (Chihuahua beds) + 18 (Collie beds) = 26 pounds

Then find the amount of stuffing in 4 chihuahua beds: 2 pounds/bed * 4 beds = <<2*4=8>>8 pounds
Then find the amount of stuffing in 3 collie beds: 5 pounds/bed * 3 beds = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds

1. First, we need to find out how long it took John to drive from his friend's house to home without the detour. Distance = Speed * Time.
2. We know the distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and John's speed is 70 mph. So, Time = Distance / Speed.
3. Time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 28 hours/1008 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

4. John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. This doesn't affect the time spent on the main route, since the speed was given as constant.

5. The distance from his friend's house to home is 240 miles, and John drives this part at a speed of 80 mph. Time = Distance / Speed.
6. Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

7. The total time spent on the entire trip is the sum of the times spent on each part of the trip.
8. Total Time = Time spent to friend's house + Time spent from friend's house to home

96 (total fourth-graders) - 43 (girls) = 53 boys

Step 2: We are told that on Friday, 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. Let's find out how many fourth-grade students were present at school that day:
53 (boys) - 4 (boys absent) = 51 boys present
43 (girls) - 5 (girls absent) = 38 girls present
Total students present = 51 boys + 38 girls = 89 students

Step 3: Now we want to find out the number of fourth-grade boys who were present at Small Tree School on Friday. We already know there are 51 boys in total, but 4 of them were absent. So, the number of fourth-grade boys present is:

                 [/INST] To find the minimum number of points Jane needs to score on the third test in order to pass with a total of at least 42 points from all three tests, we need to calculate the maximum possible number of points she could have scored on the first two tests and then find the difference between 42 (the minimum total required) and that number to determine the minimum number of points she could score on the third test.

First Test Points: 15
Second Test Points: 18

Total points from the first two tests = 15 + 18 = 33

The minimum number of points Jane could have scored on the first two tests is 15 on the first and 18 on the second (which is the actual number of points she did score). However, we need to find out the maximum possible number of points she could have scored on the first two tests while still reaching the minimum total of 42 points – this is important because this value will determine the minimum number of points she must score on the third test.

To find the max number of points on the first two tests, we can simply subtract the minimum number of points she scored (33) from the minimum total required (42).

Difference between minimum total required (42) and actual points scored (33) = 11

Therefore, the maximum number of points Jane could have scored on the first two tests is 33 + 11 = 44.

Since Jane actually scored 33 points on the first two tests, she must score at least 11 points more on the third test to reach a minimum total of 42 points.

1. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. Four times the number of customers kicked out for mask refusal minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for mask refusal as x. So, the number of shoplifting offenders is 4x - 5.
3. Three times the number of shoplifting offenders were kicked out for physical violence. So, the number of people kicked out for physical violence is 3(4x - 5) = 12x - 15.
4. The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 3(for mask refusal) + (4x - 5)(for shoplifting) + (12x - 15)(for physical violence) = 3 + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 17x - 13.
5. We're given that the total number of people kicked out is 50, so we have the equation: 17x - 13 = 50.

First, let's write the equation:

Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's current points + Sara's previous points
14 + s = 3 * Sara's current points + s + 8

Next, eliminate the ""s"" term on the left side:

14 = 2*Sara's current points + 8

Now, let's find Sara's current points:

Sara's current points = (14 - 8) / 2
Sara's current points = 6

Now, let's find ""s"":

14 = 2 * 6 * 3 + s
14 = 36 + s
s = 14 - 36
s = -22

However, the negative value of points doesn't make sense. Therefore, we made an error somewhere. Going back to the equation, 14 = 2 * Sara's current points + 8, we can find that Sara had 2 points before Erin scored 14 points:

Sara's previous points = Sara's current points - 8

Step 2: On Saturday, they sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday. So, they sold 14 × 2 = 28 pairs of tennis shoes on Saturday.

Step 3: On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they sold on Saturday and six pairs were returned. So, they sold 28 × 1/2 = 14 pairs of tennis shoes on Sunday. But they had to return 6 pairs, so they effectively sold 14 - 6 = 8 pairs of tennis shoes on Sunday.

Step 4: To find the total number of tennis shoes sold during the weekend sale, add the number of pairs sold on each day:

1. On Tuesdays, Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour.
2. On Thursdays, she had dance practice for 2 hours.
3. On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class.

Let's find the duration of Hallie's dance practice on Saturdays:
The Saturday dance practice lasts twice as long as the Tuesday's practice, which is 1 hour: 1 hour * 2 = 2 hours.

Now we can calculate the total number of hours Hallie spends on dance practice each week:
1 hour (Tuesday) + 2 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Saturday) = {The final answer is: 5 hours of dance practice per week}</s>","She had practice for 1 hour on Tuesday and 2 hours on Thursday so she practiced for 1+2 = <<1+2=3>>3 hours

                 [/INST] First, let's find the number of pieces of equipment that were purchased. We know that the total cost of the equipment was $400,000 and that 40% of them were faulty. This means that 60% of the equipment were functioning:

$400,000 = (0.6 * Number of functioning pieces) + (0.4 * Number of faulty pieces)

To find the number of functioning pieces, we can isolate that term on one side of the equation:

Number of functioning pieces = $400,000 / 0.6
Number of functioning pieces = $666,667 / 0.6
Number of functioning pieces ≈ 1,106,667 / 1.2 (rounded to the nearest whole number)
Number of functioning pieces ≈ 922.25 * 1.2 ≈ 1,106.72 ≈ 1,107

Since we cannot have a fraction of a piece of equipment, we'll round down to 1,106 functioning pieces.

Next, we'll calculate how many faulty pieces were sold:

Total number of pieces = 1,106
Number of faulty pieces = 0.4 * Total number of pieces
Number of faulty pieces = 0.4 * 1,106
Number of faulty pieces = 442.4
Number of faulty pieces ≈ 442 (rounded down to the nearest whole number)

Then we'll find the amount of money spent on the faulty pieces:

Cost of faulty pieces = Number of faulty pieces * Price per piece
Price per piece = Total cost / Total number of pieces
Price per piece = $400,000 / 1,106
Price per piece ≈ $362.11
Cost of faulty pieces = 442 * $362.11
Cost of faulty pieces ≈ $158,207.74

Now, we'll find the amount of money spent on the functioning pieces. We already know the total cost and the number of functioning pieces, so we can simply subtract the cost of the faulty ones from the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of functioning pieces + Cost of faulty pieces
Cost of functioning pieces = Total cost - Cost of faulty pieces
Cost of functioning pieces = $400,000 - $158,207.74
Cost of functioning pieces ≈ $241,792.26

Since the faulty pieces of equipment were worth $400000, the functioning equipment was worth $400000-$160000 = $<<400000-160000=240000>>240000

                 [/INST] To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to find the milk production from each half of her sheep and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of sheep in each half:
Total number of sheep = 30
Number of sheep in one half = Total number of sheep / 2
Number of sheep in one half = 30 / 2 = 15

Now, we know that half of her sheep produce 1 . kg of milk every day, and the other half produce 2 . kg of milk every day.

Milk production from the first half = Number of sheep in the first half * Milk production per sheep
Milk production from the first half = 15 * 1 . kg
Milk production from the first half = 15 kg

Similarly,
Milk production from the second half = Number of sheep in the second half * Milk production per sheep
Milk production from the second half = 15 * 2 . kg
Milk production from the second half = 30 kg

Finally, to find the total milk production every day, we add the milk production from both halves:

Total milk production every day = Milk production from the first half + Milk production from the second half
Total milk production every day = 15 kg + 30 kg
Total milk production every day = 45 kg

{The final answer is: 45 kg}</s>","Half of the sheep is 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15.

1. Mrs. Sherman baked a dozen rolls, which is equivalent to 12 rolls.
2. She gave one roll to each of her 6 children, so she used 6 rolls in total for feeding her children.
3. She then broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces, making a total of 8 * (remaining rolls - 6) pieces.
4. Substituting the number of rolls she used for her children (6) in the equation, we get 8 * (12 - 6), which simplifies to 8 * 6 = 48.

Therefore, the final answer is: Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.</s>","After feeding her children, Mrs. Sherman was left with 12 - 6 = <<12-6=6>>6 rolls

                 [/INST] Step 1: We are given that there are 40 pupils in the class.

Step 2: Half of the class likes blue. So, the number of pupils who like blue is (1/2) * 40 = 20.

Step 3: The remaining pupils after those who like blue is 40 - 20 = 20 pupils.

Step 4: One-fourth of these remaining pupils like green. So, the number of pupils who like green is (1/4) * 20 = 5.

Step 5: Now, we know that the number of pupils who like blue is 20, those who like green is 5, so the number of pupils who like yellow is the total number of pupils in the class, who is 40, minus those who like blue and those who like green. Thus, the number of pupils who like yellow is 40 - 20 - 5 = 15.

The final answer is: There are 15 pupils who like the color yellow.</s>","There are 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pupils who like blue.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of apples Lucy picked on each day as follows:

Let A = apples picked on Monday
Let B = apples picked on Tuesday
Let C = apples picked on Wednesday

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.
3. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked the previous day.
4. From selling the apples picked on Monday, she earned $56.

First, let's find the number of apples Lucy picked on Monday. We know she sold all of them and earned $56, so:

A = Number of apples picked on Monday
A = $56 * (Number of apples per dollar)
A = $56 * 4
A = $224

So Lucy picked 224 apples on Monday.

Next, let's determine the number of apples she picked on Tuesday and Wednesday:

1. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.
2. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.

So,
B = 12
C = 2 * B
C = 2 * 12
C = 24

Therefore, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:
A + B + C
224 + 12 + 24 = 258

{The final answer is: Lucy picked a total of 258 apples over the three days.}</s>","Since each apple costs $4, it means that on Monday, Lucy picked 56/4 = <<56/4=14>>14 apples
Combining Monday and Tuesday, Lucy picked 14 + 12 = <<14+12=26>>26 apples
On Wednesday, she picked 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 apples

                    Lindsay is doing the laundry, and thinks she has missed some socks. There are 50 socks that need washing. If , she washes 10 pairs of socks and 15 loose socks, ! how many socks has Lindsay missed?
                 [/INST] To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to find out how many socks she has washed. We know that she has washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair contains 2 socks. So, the number of socks in the pairs is:

10 pairs * 2 socks/pair = 20 pairs * 2 socks/pair = 40 socks

Additionally, she has washed 15 loose socks, which add:

15 socks

Thus, the total number of socks Lindsay has washed is:

40 socks (from pairs) + 15 socks (from loose) = 55 socks

Now, let's find out how many socks Lindsay still needs to wash. There were originally 50 socks, so:

50 socks (total) - 55 socks (washed) = -5 socks (she's washed too many)

Since Lindsay has washed too many socks, the calculation suggests that she has actually washed more socks than she had initially, indicating an error in the problem statement itself. However, for the sake of finding out how many socks Lindsay might have missed according to the given information, we assume she should have washed 50 socks.

Since she has washed 55 socks and should have washed 50, then:

55 socks (washed) - 50 socks (needed to be washed) = 5 socks (extra)

Therefore, we conclude that Lindsay has possibly washed an extra 5 socks, leaving her with:

50 socks (needed) + 5 socks (extra) = 55 socks (total)

If Lindsay missed socks, it would mean the initial number of socks, 50, was short, meaning she missed 5 socks (original 50 socks - actual 45 socks she washed).

{The final answer is: Lindsay might have missed 5 socks; however, based on the given information, there's a discrepancy with the original problem statement, and Lindsay has actually washed more socks than she should have.}</s>","Splitting the pairs shows there were 10 pairs of socks * 2 socks/pair = <<10*2=20>>20 socks paired together.
This means she has washed a total of 20 paired socks + 15 loose socks = <<20+15=35>>35 socks.
She has therefore missed 50 socks – 35 socks = <<50-35=15>>15 socks.

                 [/INST] To find the monthly payment, we can use the formula for calculating the monthly payment of an equal installment loan:

Monthly Payment = [Total Loan Amount * (Annual Interest Rate/12)] / (1 - (1 + Annuals Interest Rate/12) ^ (-Number of Months))

Given, Total Loan amount = $3,650, Annual Interest rate = 10% = 0.1, and Number of Months = 5.

Let's calculate step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly interest rate.
Annual interest rate = 10% = 0.1, so Monthly interest rate = 0.1 / 12 = 0.00833333.

Step 2: Plug the values into the formula.
Monthly Payment = [$3,650 * (0.1/12)] / (1 - (1 + 0.00833333) ^ (-5))

Step 3: Calculate the value inside the brackets.
1 - (1 + 0.00833333) ^ (-5) = 1 - 0.411414099 = 0.588585901

Step 4: Plug that value back into the formula.
Monthly Payment = $3,650 * (0.00833333) / 0.588585901

Step 5: Calculate the monthly payment.
Monthly Payment = $3,650 * 0.00833333 / 0.588585901 ≈ $704.17

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the distance Cho hiked.
Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for a total time of 8 hours. To find the distance, we multiply his speed by the time he spent hiking:
14 kilometers per hour * 8 hours = 112 kilometers. {The distance Cho hiked is 112 kilometers.}

Step 2: Calculate the distance Chloe hiked.
Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for a total time of 5 hours. To find the distance she hiked, we multiply her speed by the time she spent hiking:
9 kilometers per hour * 5 hours = 45 kilometers. {Chloe hiked a total of 45 kilometers.}

Step 3: Find the difference in distance between Cho and Chloe.
To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

                    question:
                    Millie decides to open a lemonade stand. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 ? pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many cups of lemonade Millie can make with her supplies.
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Step 2: Calculate how long it takes for Millie to sell all of her lemonade in cups.
Total cups = 36
Cups sold per hour = 4
Hours to sell all = Total cups / Cups sold per hour
Hours to sell all = 36 / 4 = 9 hours

Step 3: Find the revenue Millie makes per hour by selling cups of lemonade.
Cups sold per hour = 4
Price per cup = $1
Revenue per hour = Price per cup * Cups sold per hour
Revenue per hour = $1 * 4 = $4

Step 4: To find the profit per hour, we need to subtract the cost of supplies from the revenue per hour.
Cost of Supplies = $18
Profit per hour = Revenue per hour - Cost of Supplies
Profit per hour = $4 - $18/36
Profit per hour = $4 - $0.5
Profit per hour = $3.5

{The final answer is: Millie makes a profit of $3.5 per hour.}</s>","She has enough supplies to make 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 cups of lemonade.
She sells all of the lemonade for 36 * $1 = $<<36*1=36>>36.
Her total profit for selling the lemonade is $36 - $18 = $<<36-18=18>>18.
It will take Millie 36 / 4 = <<36/4=9>>9 hours of work to sell all of the lemonade.
Her hourly profit is $18 / 9 hours = $<<18/9=2>>2 per hour.

                    Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his ? land and had 12.8 hectares left. How . much land did . he have at first?
                 [/INST] To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to find out how many hectares he sold. since he sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left, we can set up the equation:

land he had at first = land sold + remaining land

we know that the land sold = (3/5) * total land and the remaining land = 12.8 hectares.

So,
(3/5) * total land = 12.8 hectares

To find the total land, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation:

total land = (5/3) * 12.8 hectares

but we don't have a common factor of 3 and 5, we can't divide directly. we can use a multiplication factor of 1.5 to convert 3 to 5, and then divide:

total land = (5/3) * 12.8 hectares * 1.5

total land = 22.08 * 1.5

total land = 33.12 hectares

The final answer is: {Mr. Ruther had 33.12 hectares of land at first.}</s>","Mr. Ruther is left with 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.
Since 2/5 is equal to 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 is equal to 12.8/2 = <<12.8/2=6.4>>6.4 hectares.
Hence, Mr. Ruther had 6.4 x 5 = <<6.4*5=32>>32 hectares of land at first.

Step 1: Add up all the test scores:
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 310

Step 2: Divide the total by the number of tests to find the average:
310 ÷ 5 = 62

However, our answer is not what we were looking for since Wilson's math grade needs to be 80 or higher. Therefore, we need to calculate the average again with a possible score (higher than 74) that can help him meet the requirement. Let's say, for instance, Wilson takes a makeup test and scores an 88.

Step 3: Add up all the test scores including the new score:
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 + 88 = 328

Step 4: Divide the total by the number of tests (now including the new score) to find the new average:
328 ÷ 6 = 54.67

Since one cannot have a decimal in a grade, we'll round up and report that Wilson's current math grade is 55, but for him to meet the requirement of having a 80 or higher, he would need to have the new score of 88 added to his test results.

                 [/INST] To find the number of popsicles each has and the difference between their numbers, let's first determine the number of popsicles Betty has based on the given ratio.

1. According to the ratio, for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. We want to find the number of popsicles Betty has when the total number of popsicles they have together is 165.
2. Let x be the number of popsicles Betty has.Then, the number of popsicles Sam has is (x * 6 / 5).
3. The sum of the number of popsicles they both have is  x + (x * 6 / 5). 
4. We know that x + (x * 6 / 5) = 165.

Now we need to find the value of x:

1. First, let's find the common factor between 5 and 165 (the total number of popsicles) which is 5.
2. Divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the common factor (5): 165 / 5 = 33
3. Now, we have 33 groups of 5 popsicles that Betty has: x = 5 * 33 = 165 popsicles.

However, this result indicates that Betty has exactly as many popsicles as Sam, which contradicts the initial condition (ratio of 5:6). It's important to note that the problem statement does not make it clear if the total number of popsicles given (165) accounts for both Betty and Sam or if just one of them (e.g., Betty).

Therefore, with the current information provided, we cannot calculate the difference in the number of popsicles between Betty and Sam. The provided information seems to contain inconsistency. Consequently, we cannot determine the difference in the number of popsicles.

The final answer is: {Unfortunately, we cannot determine the difference between the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have with the given information.}</s>","The total ratio representing the number of popsicles that Betty and sam have is 5+6 = <<5+6=11>>11.

Netflix: $10
Hulu: $10 (saved 20% on $12.8, so $10)
Disney Plus: $10 (saved 20% on $12.8, so $10)

Step 2: Determine the total monthly savings by canceling cable and switching to streaming services.
Total monthly savings = (Netflix cost) + (Hulu savings) + (Disney Plus savings)
Total monthly savings = $10 + $2.8 (Hulu savings calculated as original price - saved amount) + $2.8 (Disney Plus savings calculated the same way)
Total monthly savings = $10 + $2.8 + $2.8
Total monthly savings = $15.6

Step 3: Calculate the total monthly expense reduction by canceling cable and switching to streaming services.
Total monthly expense reduction = (Cable monthly cost) - (Total monthly savings)
Total monthly expense reduction = $60 - $15.6
Total monthly expense reduction = $44.4

The final answer is: Tim saves $44.4 per month by canceling his cable subscription and getting Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus.</s>","Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20

Let's call the current number of books ""x"".

Then, Wendy wants to add 20 more than double that number, so:

Number of books Wendy wants to add = 2 * x + 20

Now, the shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns. So, the number of books currently in the system is:

x = number of books per cell * number of cells
x = (number of books per cell) * (rows * columns)
x = (number of books per cell) * (6 * 6)
x = (number of books per cell) * 36

We are not given the number of books per cell, so let's denote it as ""n"".

Then, the number of books Wendy wants to add is:

Number of books Wendy wants to add = 2 * (n * 36) + 20

Since Wendy wants to put this new number of books into the same shelving system, we have:

New number of books = Number of books Wendy wants to add + Current number of books

Substituting the expressions found above:

New number of books = (2 * (n * 36) + 20) + (n * 36)

To solve for the new number of books, we need to know the number of books per cell (n). Without this information, we cannot find the exact number of books Wendy needs to carry.

Therefore, we cannot determine the final answer without more information.

{The final answer is not provided because the number of books per cell is not known.}</s>","The capacity of the shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns is 6*6=<<6*6=36>>36 books.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find out how many slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark. We know that Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, so the number of slices for Bill is:

1/3 * 12 = 4 slices

Similarly, she gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So, the number of slices for Mark is:

1/4 * 12 = 3 slices

Step 2: We're also given that Jenny ate 2 slices. To find out how many slices are left, we just need to subtract the number of slices Jenny gave to Bill, Mark, and the slices she ate.

First, we calculate the number of slices Jenny ate:

2 slices

Then, we calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark:

4 slices (given to Bill) + 3 slices (given to Mark) = 7 slices

Now, to find out how many slices are left, we need to subtract the slices Jenny ate, as well as the slices she gave to Bill and Mark:

12 (total slices) - 2 (slices Jenny ate) - 4 (slices Jenny gave to Bill) - 3 (slices Jenny gave to Mark) = 1 slice

Step 1: Find out how much more Mark needs to save for the bike.
$300 (cost of the bike) - $50 (the amount Mark has) = $255

Step 2: Find out how many days it takes for Mark to save the required amount.
$255 ÷ $10 (Mark's daily earnings) = 25.5
Since Mark can't save half a day, he needs to save for an additional full day.
$255 ÷ $10 = 26 days

                 [/INST] Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Erica's age is Beth's age minus 5 years. We are given that Beth is 5 years old. Therefore, Erica's age is:
   Erica's age = Beth's age - 5
   Erica's age = 5 - 5 = 0 (Note: There's a mistake in the problem statement, as Beth and Erica have the same age, which is not mentioned in the question)
2. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is Beth's age plus 7 years.
   Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
3. Since we don't have Beth's age in the problem, we cannot directly calculate Alice's age. However, we can find the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages.
   The difference between Alice's and Erica's ages = Alice's age - Erica's age
   The difference between Alice's and Erica's ages = (Beth's age + 7) - (Beth's age)
   The difference between Alice's and Erica's ages = 7

So, Alice is 7 years older than Erica.

However, since there is a mistake in the problem statement, as Beth and Erica have the same age (5), none of the given relationships can be valid. Therefore, the problem has no solution according to the given information.

1. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour, so for a quadruple batch, Mark will need 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cups of flour.
2. The normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk, so for a quadruple batch, Mark will need 1 * 4 = <<1*4=4>>4 cups of milk.

Next, let's find how many 2-cup bags of flour Mark will need to buy.

3. Since 1 cup = 0.5 * 2 cups, Mark will need 12 cups of flour in 12 * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 bags of flour.

Now, let's find how many 2-cup bottles of milk Mark will need to buy.

4. Mark will need 4 cups of milk in 4 * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 bottles of milk.

5. Therefore, Mark has to buy 6 bags of flour - 8 bottles of milk = <<6-8=-2>>-2 less bags of flour than bottles of milk. However, this is not possible, because Mark can't buy a negative number of bags of flour. So, the answer cannot be correct as stated.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy each hour.

Step 2: Determine the energy saved each hour by using the air conditioner for fewer hours.
Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, so he saves 1 hour (5 hours less than 8 hours) worth of energy each day. Since the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour, he saves 900 watts of energy each day by using the AC for 1 less hour.

Step 3: Convert the saved energy from watts to kilowatts.
To save 900 watts of energy per day is to save 0.9 kilowatts (kW) of energy per day (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts).

Step 4: Calculate the total saved energy in 30 days.
To find the total saved energy in 30 days, multiply the daily saved energy (0.9 kW) by the number of days (30): 0.9 kW/day * 30 days = 27 kW

{The final answer is: Mel saves 27 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days by using the air conditioner for fewer hours each day.}</s>","An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.

So, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.
That is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.

1. Jane counts 2 zebras, each with 17 stripes. So the first two zebras have a combined total of 17 * 2 = <<17*2=34>>34 stripes.
2. There is a zebra with 36 stripes.
3. The last zebra has half the number of stripes as the one with 36 stripes, which is 36 / 2 = <<36/2=18.5>>18.5 stripes, but since a zebra can't have half a stripe, we'll round this up to 19 stripes for the last zebra.
4. Adding the total number of stripes on all the zebras, we get: 34 (from the first two zebras) + 36 (from the third zebra) + 19 (from the fourth zebra) = <<34+36+19=89>>89 stripes in total.
5. The average number of stripes for all the zebras is obtained by dividing the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 89 stripes (total) / 4 zebras = <<89/4=22.25>>22.25 stripes per zebra.

Number of sandwiches needed = Total number of people / Number of people per sandwich
Number of sandwiches needed = 20 / 4
Number of sandwiches needed = 5 sandwiches

However, since you cannot make a fraction of a sandwich, Tyson will need to make 6 sandwiches instead of 5 to ensure he has enough to serve all 20 people.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of meat and cheese needed for 6 sandwiches.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So, for 6 sandwiches we need:

Meat = 1 pound * 6 sandwiches = 6 pounds
Cheese = 1 pound * 6 sandwiches = 6 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese.

Meat cost = 6 pounds * $7.00/pound = $42.00
Cheese cost = 6 pounds * $3.00/pound = $18.00

Total cost = Meat cost + Cheese cost = $42.00 + $18.00 = $60.00

                    : Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps . a : day. He finished half , of his : steps on : his , walks to ; and from school and : did another 1,000 steps going for a short : walk . with his friend. , He also . went for ; a short . jog around the : block and realized that after he : had finished his jog, ; he only ; had 2,000 steps left to take. How many ! steps did Elliott take ; during his jog?
                 [/INST] To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we first need to determine the number of steps he took while walking to and from school and with his friend.

1. Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Half of his daily goal of 10,000 steps is 5,000 steps.
2. He also took an additional 1,000 steps during a short walk with his friend, so the total number of steps he took before his jog is: 5,000 (half of his daily goal) + 1,000 (steps from the short walk) = 6,000 steps.
3. Elliott realized he only had 2,000 steps left after his jog, so to find out how many steps he took during his jog, subtract the number of steps he took before his jog from the total number of steps he took during the day: 10,000 (his daily goal) - 6,000 (steps before jog) = 4,000 steps.

{The final answer is: Elliott took 4,000 steps during his jog.}</s>","Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of words in the book.
The book has 45 pages, and each page contains an average of 200 words. So, the total number of words in the book is:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Step 2: Calculate how long it will take Toby to finish the book.
Toby can read 300 words per minute, so it will take him:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Step 3: Calculate how long it takes Toby to get to the airport.
It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport.

Step 4: Calculate when Toby will arrive at the airport if he leaves as soon as he finishes the book.
He finishes the book in 30 minutes and then it takes him an additional 10 minutes to get to the airport:
30 minutes (reading) + 10 minutes (travel) = 40 minutes

Step 5: Calculate how early Toby will be.
Since he has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and he will arrive in 40 minutes, he will be:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes early.

{The final answer is: Toby will be 20 minutes early.}</s>","He can read 1.5 pages in a minute because 300 / 200 = <<300/200=1.5>>1.5

- In May, they hired 40 employees.
- In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, the number of employees in June is 3/4 * 40 = 30.

Step 2: Calculate the weekly wages for each employee.
- Each employee works for a 40-hour workweek.
- The hourly wage is $15.
- Their weekly wages would be $15 * 40 hours = $600.

Step 3: Find the total amount paid to employees in each month.
- In May, the total amount paid is 40 employees * $600 weekly wages = $24,000.
- In June, the total amount paid is 30 employees * $600 weekly wages = $18,000.

The final answer is:

Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy, and each pound cost $3 ($3/pound). Therefore, the cost of the taffy is: 2 * $3 = $6

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets.
Sally spent $1.50 on a mixed bag of seashells, and she bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each. So, the cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Therefore, the total cost of seashells and magnets is: $1.5 + $1 = $2.5

Step 3: Determine the total amount of money Sally spent at the trinket shop.
Total shop cost = cost of taffy + cost of seashells and magnets
Total shop cost = $6 + $2.5 = $8.5

Given that the first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, we have:
Cost of second pack = 2 * Cost of first pack
Cost of second pack = 2 * $400
Cost of second pack = $800

Step 2: Calculate the discounted price of the fireworks in the packs.
Given that Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, we have:
Discounted price = Cost * (1 - Discount_rate)
Discounted price = ($400 + $800) * (1 - 0.2)
Discounted price = $2800 * 0.8
Discounted price = $2240

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the fireworks in the packs after the discount.
Total cost of fireworks = Discounted price
Total cost of fireworks = $2240

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the fireworks and the finale firework.
Total cost = Cost of fireworks + Cost of finale firework
Total cost = $2240 + $150
Total cost = $2390

1. Shannon eats 2 cookies a day, so she needs a total of:
   Cookies needed for 30 days = Daily consumption * Number of days
   = 2 cookies/day * 30 days
   = 60 cookies

2. Each batch of Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, so she needs to make:
   Batches needed = Total number of cookies / Cookies per batch
   = 60 cookies / 12 cookies/batch
   = 5 batches

3. Since each batch makes 12 cookies, in total Shannon needs to make:
   Cookies to be made = Batches needed * Cookies per batch
   = 5 batches * 12 cookies/batch
   = 60 cookies

Step 1: Find the number of candles with the defect of smelling like wet dog.
If 5% of the candles have this defect, then:
Number of candles with this defect = Total number of candles * Percentage with the defect
Number of candles with this defect = 50000 * 0.05
Number of candles with this defect = 2500

Step 2: Find the number of candles with the defect that also explode.
The question doesn't provide enough information to determine this number directly. It only mentions that Marcy markets her candles as 99% guaranteed not to explode, but it does not give an explicit percentage of candles that actually don't explode. Therefore, it's not possible to determine the number of candles that both have the wet dog smell defect and don't explode, since we don't know how many of the candles with the defect don't explode.

Step 3: Conclusion

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as x, and the number of apples she gathered from the shortest trees as y. We are given that:

x + y/2 + x/2 = 30 (Joanne's apples from tallest and average trees)
y + y/3 = 30 (Joanne's apples from shortest trees)

First, let's solve for the number of apples Joanne gathered from the shortest trees, y.

From the second equation, we have:
2y = 30
y = 15

So Joanne gathered 15 apples from the shortest trees.

Now, we need to find out how many apples her sister collected from the shortest trees. According to the problem statement, her sister collects 3 times as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees. So we have:

Number of apples her sister gathered from shortest trees = 3 * 15 = 45

From the first equation, we know that Joanne gathered a total of 30 apples from the tallest and average trees. Let's denote the number of apples she gathered from the average trees by z. Then we have:

x + x/2 + z = 30

Now let's find x. We know that Joanne and her sister collected a combined total of 500 apples. Joanne's share is 30 apples from tallest and average trees and 15 apples from shortest trees, so her sister gathered 500 - 30 - 15 = 485 apples from the average trees.

According to the problem statement, her sister collected half of the apples that Joanne gathered from the tallest trees, so her share of the apples from the tallest trees is (1/2)x = x/2. We also know that x/2 + z = 30, so z = 30 - x/2.

Since her sister gathered 485 apples from the average trees, we have:

x/2 + (30 - x/2) = 485
x/2 + 30 - x/2 = 485
2x/2 = 485 + 30
x = 510

This value doesn't make sense as Joanne's share of apples is supposed to be less than her sister's. The problem might be incorrect or incomplete. So, without knowing the exact relationship between the number of apples Joanne and her sister gathered from the orchard, we cannot determine the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

{The final answer is uncertain due to an incomplete or ambiguous problem statement.}</s>","Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.

1. Let C represent the number of camels, and D represent the number of dromedaries.
2. We know that there are 180 heads in total, so we have the equation C + D = 180.
3. We also know that there are 304 bumps in total, since each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump, we have the equation 2C + D = 304.
4. Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the number of camels and dromedaries.
5. First, we can isolate C in the first equation: C = 180 - D.
6. Next, we can substitute C in the second equation: 2(180 - D) + D = 304.
7. Expanding the equation, we have 360 - 2D + D = 304.
8. Solving for D, we get D = 360 - 358 = 2. However, this number doesn't make sense in the context of the problem since we cannot have 2 camels or fewer than 304 bumps.
9. It seems that there is an inconsistency in the given information or there is a mistake in the problem statement.

Given this information, the problem doesn't have a clear-cut solution, and it's likely that there is an error in the provided data. {The final answer is: Unfortunately, there is no valid solution to this problem due to inconsistent information.}</s>","Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.

                    Tom went ; on a two-week-long trip through Europe. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over ; the next two days, he totaled only 30% of , the : distance traveled over the first four days.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's find out how many kilometers Tom traveled during the first four days and the next two days.
- He traveled 200 kilometers every day for 4 days, so in the first 4 days, he traveled 200 * 4 = <<200*4=800>>800 kilometers.
- The next two days, he traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. So, he traveled 0.3 * 800 = <<0.3*800=240>>240 kilometers during those two days.

Step 2: Let's find out how many kilometers Tom traveled during the last 5 days of his trip.
- During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day, so in the last 5 days, he traveled 300 * 5 = <<300*5=1500>>1500 kilometers.

Step 3: Let's add up the total number of kilometers Tom traveled during his entire trip.
- In the first 4 days, he traveled 800 kilometers.
- In the next 2 days, he traveled 240 kilometers.
- In the last 5 days, he traveled 1500 kilometers.

The final answer is: Tom traveled 800 + 240 + 1500 = <<800+240+1500=2540>>2540 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.</s>","In the first four days, Tom made 4 * 200 = <<4*200=800>>800 kilometers.
For the next two days, he made only 30/100 * 800 = <<30/100*800=240>>240 kilometers.
During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day, which means 7 * 300 = <<7*300=2100>>2100 kilometers during the whole week.
During his whole trip, Tom made 800 + 240 + 2100 = <<800+240+2100=3140>>3140 kilometers.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. Thus, Zack's locker is 1.5 times the size of Peter's locker: Zack's locker = 5 cubic inches * 1.5 = 7.5 cubic inches.
2. We also know that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. So, to find the size of Timothy's locker, first we need to determine the size of Zack's locker, which is 7.5 cubic inches. Then, since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we have Timothy's locker = 2 * Zack's locker = 2 * 7.5 cubic inches = 15 cubic inches.

Therefore, the final answer is: Timothy's locker is 15 cubic inches.</s>","Zack's locker is 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 cubic inches.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the elevation of Stanley's comb after it fell.
Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the elevation of Stanley's comb is 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet.

Step 2: Calculate the difference in elevation between Stanley's and Oliver's positions.
Stanley is at an elevation of 6,000 feet, and Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. The difference in their elevations is 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

Step 3: Determine if Oliver needs to climb to reach Stanley's comb.
Since Oliver's current elevation is lower than Stanley's comb, Oliver would need to climb to reach it.

Step 4: Find the amount of climbing Oliver needs to do.
The difference in their elevations (3,000 feet) is the amount of climbing Oliver would need to do to reach Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: Oliver would need to climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.</s>","The elevation of Stanley's comb was 10,000 - 4,000 = <<10000-4000=6000>>6,000 feet.

1. Mr. Josue received $4000 from the first bank.
2. He received twice as much from the second bank. So, the amount he received from the second bank is $4000 * 2 = $8000.
3. In total, Mr. Josue received $4000 + $8000 = $12000.
4. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital.
5. Now, he has the initial capital plus the amount he received from the banks.

                 [/INST] Step 1:Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Step 2: Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, 5 cats were taken away.

Step 3: Therefore, the number of cats left was 50 - 5 = <<50-5=45>>45 cats.

Step 4: Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats chased after a mouse and ran away. To find out how many cats ran away, we need to find 3/5 of 45.

Step 5: Multiply the number of cats (45) by the fraction 3/5: (3/5) * 45 = 27/1 (Cannot have a fraction of a cat, so here we need to find the equivalent integer value).

Step 6: To find the equivalent integer value, we can find the value of the numerator(27) multiplied by the denominator(5) of the fraction: 27 * 5 = 135. Now, divide the product by the number of cats initially on the rock to find the fraction of cats that left the rock: 135/50 = 7/2 (This fraction doesn't make sense since it doesn't represent the number of cats).

Step 7: Since the problem asks for the number of cats left on the rock, and in the previous step, we found that 27 cats ran after the mouse, we can subtract those from the initial number of cats to find out how many cats were left: 50 - 27 = <<50-27=23>>23 cats.

{The final answer is 23 cats were left on the rock.}</s>","When four boats carried away 5 cats each, the total number of cats that left the rock is 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cats.

Later 3/5 of the remaining cats left the rock and ran after a mouse, a total of 3/5*30 = <<3/5*30=18>>18 cats.

1. For the first 6 months, Bill paid $8 a month.
Cost for the first segment = $8 * number of months

2. For the next 8 months, Bill paid $12 a month.
Cost for the second segment = $12 * number of months

3. For the final segment of 8 months, Bill paid $14 a month.
Cost for the third segment = $14 * number of months

Now, we know that the first segment lasts for 6 months, and the total subscription period is 2 years, or 24 months. Therefore, the number of months for the second and third segments is 14 months each (since 24 months = 6 months for the first segment + 14 months for each of the next two segments).

Cost for the second segment = $12 * 14 = $168
Cost for the third segment = $14 * 14 = $196

Total Cost of the Service for 2 years = Cost for the first segment + Cost for the second segment + Cost for the third segment

If he saved 1/3 of the ! total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the given information and find the answer step by step:

1. The tattered jeans cost $28.
2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
3. Cole saved a total of $6 from the sale.
4. He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

First, let's find out how much Cole saved on the jogger jeans:
1. Jogger jeans cost $6 less than tattered jeans.
2. Tattered jeans cost $28.

So, jogger jeans originally cost:
Jogger jeans cost = Tattered jeans cost - $6
Jogger jeans cost = $28 - $6
Jogger jeans cost = $22

Now, let's denote the amount Cole saved on the tattered jeans as ""x"", and the amount he saved on the jogger jeans as ""y."" We know that x + y = $6 (total savings).

Since he saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, we can represent y as:
y = (1/3)x

We also know that y = $6 - x, because we found out that he saved $6 on the jeans in total.
Using the above equation, we can write:
$6 - x = x / 3

Now, we can find the value of x:
x = 3 * ($6 - x)
x = 3 * $6 - 3 * x
x = $18 - 3x
x + 3x = $18
4x = $18
x = $18 / 4
x = $4.5

So, Cole saved $4.5 on tattered jeans.
To find the savings on jogger jeans, we can use the equation we found earlier:
y = $6 - x
y = $6 - $4.5
y = $1.5

But, we know that he saved 1/3 of the savings from jogger jeans, so:
$1.5 = (1/3) * ($6 - $4.5)
$1.5 = $2 - (1/3) * $4.5
$1.5 = $2 - ($1.5)
$1.5 = $0.5

This is not a logical solution, so the problem has a mistake or inconsistency. {The final answer is: The problem is inconsistent}.</s>","Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.
The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.
Cole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28
Hence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.
Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the number of employees that can be accommodated in each type of vehicle and find the total capacity of all vehicles combined.

1. Capacity of buses: 4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees
2. Capacity of minibuses: x minibuses * 30 employees/minibus (x is unknown)
3. Capacity of minivans: 10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees

To find the number of minibuses needed to accommodate x number of employees, we can set up the equation: 30employees/minibus = total number of employees / number of minibuses

total number of employees = 30minibuses * x

Now let's find the total capacity of all vehicles:
total capacity = 240employees (buses) + total number of employees in minibuses + 150employees (minivans)

Let's assume there are 15 minibuses, then calculate the total capacity for verification:
total capacity = 240 + 30*15 + 150
total capacity = 240 + 450 + 150
total capacity = 840 employees

total number of employees = 30minibuses * x
840 = 30x
x = 28

So, 15 minibuses can accommodate 15 * 30 = 450 employees
But here we found that total capacity is 840. That means our assumption was wrong.

Let's find the correct number of minibuses needed and the total capacity of the day trip.

We have 240 employees from buses and:
total capacity = 240 + 30x + 150
We know 240 + 15*30 + 150 = 840
x = (840 - 540)/30
x = 16

So, we need 16 minibuses and the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:
total capacity = 240 + 16*30 + 150
total capacity = 240 + 480 + 150
total capacity = 870 employees

{The final answer is 870}.</s>","60 x 4 = <<60*4=240>>240 employees can ride on the bus.
30 x 6 = <<30*6=180>>180 employees can ride on the minibusses.

Homemade feeder = 20 (attracted by each store-bought feeder) + 10 (additional birds) = 30 birds

Next, let's find out how many birds are attracted by each store-bought feeder:
Store-bought feeder = 20 birds

Since Lillian has built 3 homemade feeders and bought 3 store-bought ones, the total number of birds she can expect to see in her garden each day is:

Total number of birds = (Number of birds attracted by homemade feeders) x (Number of homemade feeders) + (Number of birds attracted by store-bought feeders) x (Number of store-bought feeders)

Total number of birds = (30 birds/feeder) x 3 homemade feeders + (20 birds/feeder) x 3 store-bought feeders

The cost of the bagel is $4.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the soup, which is 25% more than the cost of the bagel.
An increase of 25% on $4 is a multiplication of $4 by 1.25 (100% + 25% = 125% as a decimal).
So, the cost of the soup is $4 * 1.25 = $5 (rounded to the nearest cent).

Step 3: Determine the cost of the cake, which is half the price of the bagel.
The cost of the cake is $2 (half of $4).

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner.

                    question:
                    Kenny is selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park, which costs $100. He has a collection of cards and plans to sell them for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of them and gets to go to the amusement park . with $50 in spending cash. How many cards did he start with?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of cards that Kenny has as ""x"". He sells 2/3 of his cards to get $100 for the amusement park ticket and keeps 1/3 of his cards to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash.

First, let's find the amount of money Kenny earns from selling 2/3 of his cards:

Money from selling cards = Price per card * Number of cards sold
= $1.5 * (2/3) * x
= $1.5x * (2/3)
= $1.5x * (2) / (3)
= 2$x/3

Second, let's set up an equation representing the fact that Kenny has $100 from selling cards and has $50 left for spending cash:

2$x/3 = $100

Third, we need to solve for x by first getting rid of the dollars sign, making x the number of cards and multiplying both sides by 3/2:

2$x/3 = $100
2$x/3 = $600 (multiplying both sides by 300/100)
x = ($600 * 3/2) / 2
x = $900 / 2
x = $450

Since the number of cards cannot be a fraction, we need to find the number of cards that sold for $450. We know that each card is sold for $1.5, so:

x = $450 / $1.5
x = 300

Therefore, Kenny started with 300 cards. {The final answer is: Kenny started with 300 cards.}</s>","He made $150 selling the cards because 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150
He sold 100 cards because 150 / 1.5 = <<150/1.5=100>>100
The cards he sold were 2/3 of his collection because 1 - (1/3) = 2/3
He started with 150 cards because 100 / (2/3) = <<100/(2/3)=150>>150

How many . guests ! did ? not get a second hotdog?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of hotdogs prepared for one guest.
Since most guests would eat one hotdog, and the caterer wanted to provide enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two, we can calculate the number of hotdogs prepared per guest as follows:

1 hotdog for most guests + 1 hotdog for the second helping for half of the guests = 2 hotdogs per guest

Step 2: Calculate the number of guests for whom two hotdogs were prepared.
36 guests were specified in the question, but the caterer prepared enough for half of them to have two hotdogs. So the total number of guests for whom two hotdogs were prepared is:

half of 36 guests = 18 guests

Step 3: Find out how many hotdogs were prepared for these 18 guests.
Since 18 guests were provided with two hotdogs each, the total number of hotdogs prepared is:

18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs

Step 4: Determine the number of hotdogs consumed by the guests who had two hotdogs each.
We know that 18 guests had two hotdogs each, so the total number of hotdogs consumed by them is:

18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs

Step 5: Identify the number of hotdogs consumed by the other guests.
The remaining 18 guests (36 guests total - 18 guests with two hotdogs) also consumed one hotdog each. So the total number of hotdogs consumed by all the guests is:

18 guests with 1 hotdog * 1 hotdog/guest = 18 hotdogs

Step 6: Find out how many hotdogs were left over.
Initially, 36 hotdogs were prepared. After all the guests consumed their hotdogs (36 hotdogs in total), the remaining hotdogs, if any, would be the ones left over. So the number of hotdogs left over is:

36 hotdogs (prepared) - 36 hotdogs (consumed) = 0 hotdogs left over

However, the question states that 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. Since we have determined that there were no hotdogs left over, that means {4 guests did not get a second hotdog}.</s>","The food caterer prepared an additional 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 hot dogs.
Altogether, he prepared 36 + 18 = <<36+18=54>>54 hotdogs.
If 40 people wanted seconds, he would have needed 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 hot dogs.
80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 people did not get second hotdogs.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Indra's name has 6 letters.

Step 2: Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indra's name. So the number of letters in her sister's name is 6 + 2 = 8 letters (half of 6 is 3, and 3 added to 6 gives us 9, but since the number of letters in a name cannot be a fraction, we round up to get 8 instead).

The total cost before the discount is $120 + $20 + $25 = $<<120+20+25=165>>165.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of discount Charlotte will receive.
The discount is 20% of the total cost before the discount.
So, the discount amount is 0.2 × $165 = $<<0.2*165=33>>33.

Step 3: Find the total cost after the discount.
The total cost after the discount is the total cost before the discount minus the discount amount.
So, the total cost after the discount is $165 - $33 = $<<165-33=132>>132.

Step 4: The final answer is: Charlotte's order will cost her $<<132>>132. after the discount.</s>","She wants 5 utensils at $5.00 each so they cost 5*5 = $<<5*5=25.00>>25.00

                 [/INST] To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how many gallons are in one container and then calculate how many containers Josey needs to fill 1/4 of a container.

1. First, we need to convert gallons to pints since the question asks for the answer in pints. 1 gallon equals 128 pints.

2. The total amount of gasoline is 15 gallons.

3. This gasoline is divided equally into 5 different containers.

4. To find out how many gallons are in one container, we divide the total amount of gasoline by the number of containers: 15 gallons ÷ 5 containers = 3 gallons per container.

5. Now, to find out how many containers Josey needs to fill 1/4 of a container, we calculate 1/4 of the container's capacity: 1 container = 3 gallons ⇒ 1/4 of a container = 3 gallons ÷ 4 = 0.75 gallons.

6. Since Josey needs 1/4 of a container, we find out how many containers she needs: 0.75 gallons ÷ 3 gallons per container = 0.25 containers. Since we cannot have a fraction of a container, Josey needs to use 1 container and fill it to 3/4 of its capacity.

7. To find out how many pints are in 3/4 of a container, we multiply the number of gallons by the conversion factor: 3 gallons × 128 pints per gallon = 384 pints.

8. Since Josey needs 3/4 of a container, we calculate the number of pints she requires: 384 pints × 3/4 = 288.432 pints ≈ 288.5 pints.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many bags of chips George bought with his $5 spending. Each chip bag costs 40 cents, so we calculate:
  number_of_chip_bags = money_spent_on_chips / price_per_chip_bag
  number_of_chip_bags = $5 / 40 cents
  number_of_chip_bags = $5 / 0.4
  number_of_chip_bags = 12.5
  Since George cannot buy half a bag of chips, we know that he could buy 12 bags instead. Thus, he spent $4.8 on chips.

2. Now, we know that he spent $4.8 on chips and had $0.2 left. We need to find out how many candy bars cost $0.2:
  price_per_candy_bar = remaining_money / number_of_candy_bars
  $0.2 / price_per_candy_bar = number_of_candy_bars
  Price_per_candy_bar = $0.2 / number_of_candy_bars

3. We know that each candy bar costs 75 cents or $0.75, so we can write an equation and solve for the number of candy bars:
   0.2 = 0.75 * number_of_candy_bars
   number_of_candy_bars = 0.2 / 0.75
   number_of_candy_bars = 0.266667...
   Once again, we cannot buy a fraction of a candy bar, so we must round down to the nearest whole number. Thus, George bought 0 candy bars.

It is important to note that the reasoning above leads to an inconsistent result. Since the problem states that George spent all his money and bought both chips and candies, while the calculation shows that he could not buy any candies with the remaining money, there might be a mistake in the problem statement or the given information.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the weight of each piece of the cake.
Since Rory made 8 pieces from a 20-ounce cake, we can find the weight of one piece by dividing the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces:

1 piece = Total weight of the cake / Number of pieces
1 piece = 20 oz / 8
1 piece = 2.5 oz

Step 2: Find the weight of the pieces that Rory and her mom consumed.
Each of them had one piece, so their combined weight is:

Weight of pieces consumed = 2 people * 1 piece per person * Weight of one piece
Weight of pieces consumed = 2 * 2.5 oz
Weight of pieces consumed = 5 oz

Step 3: Find the weight of the remaining cake.
To find the weight of the remaining cake, subtract the weight of the pieces that Rory and her mom consumed from the total weight of the cake:

Weight of remaining cake = Total weight of the cake - Weight of pieces consumed
Weight of remaining cake = 20 oz - 5 oz
Weight of remaining cake = 15 oz

{The final answer is 15 ounces}</s>","Each piece of Rory’s cake weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = <<20/8=2.5>>2.5 ounces.

                 [/INST] To find out how many oranges each friend will get, we first need to determine the total number of oranges that Sitti and Juris have and then divide that amount by the number of friends plus the two of them. Here are the steps:

1. Sitti had 34 oranges, and Juris had 22 oranges, so the total number of oranges they have is: 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris' oranges) = 56 oranges.

2. They plan to share the oranges with 6 other friends, so there will be a total of 56 (Sitti and Juris' oranges) + 6 (friends) = 62 people sharing the oranges.

3. To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 oranges / 62 people = 0.9032258064516129 oranges per person.

4. However, since it is not possible for each person to have a fraction of an orange, they will have to round down the result to find out how many whole oranges everyone will get. In this case, the quotient obtained in the previous step, 0.9032258064516129, when rounded down to the nearest whole number, equals 0 oranges. Thus, there should be a mistake in the problem, and it is unclear how they expect to distribute 0.9032258064516129 oranges among 62 people.

Therefore, the problem as stated contains a mistake, and no definitive answer can be given.</s>","There are a total of 34 + 22 = <<34+22=56>>56 oranges.
Sitti, Juris, and 6 other friends will divide them equally which means there are 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 of them sharing.

What is the cost per serving? (Round to the nearest integer.)
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the amount of onions needed for a single serving.
Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions to serve 6 people. Therefore, the amount of onions needed for one serving is:
2 pounds / 6servings = 0.33 pounds of onions per serving

Step 2: Calculate the cost of onions for a single serving.
Onions are currently on sale for $2.00 per pound. So, the cost of onions for one serving is:
0.33 pounds * $2.00/pound = $0.67

Step 3: Determine the amount of beef stock needed for a single serving.
Antoine's recipe does not provide information on how much beef stock is used per serving.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of beef stock for a single serving (assuming 2 boxes are used for 6 servings).
Antoine usually doubles the amount of onions, so we can assume he also doubles the amount of beef stock. Each box of stock serves 6 people, so for 6 servings, Antoine would need:
6 servings / 3 servings per box = 2 boxes
The cost of 2 boxes of beef stock at $2.00 per box is:
2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00

Step 5: Calculate the cost per serving, including both onions and beef stock.
The cost per serving is the sum of the cost of onions and beef stock:
$0.67 + $4.00 = $4.67

Therefore, the cost per serving for Antoine's French Onion Soup is approximately $4.67 (rounded to the nearest integer).</s>","His recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions but he wants to double that amount so he needs 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 pounds of onions
Onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound so they will cost 4*2 = $8.00
He needs 2 boxes of stock which are also on sale for $2.00 so they will cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00
The onions are $8.00 and the stock is $4.00 for a total of 8+4 = $<<8+4=12.00>>12.00
The soup serves 6 people and the total cost is $12.00 so each serving is 12/6 = $<<12/6=2.00>>2.00 a serving

Step 2: Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, so it takes her 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to drive to the theater.

Step 3: Wayne wants to arrive 5 minutes before Bernadette. Therefore, he will arrive at the theater at time t. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes earlier than that, so she will arrive at time t-5.

Step 4: To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to find out how long it takes her to leave her apartment, drive to the theater, and still arrive before Wayne.

Step 5: The driving time is given, so we only need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to leave her apartment. Since the problem doesn't give any information about the time it takes Bernadette to leave her apartment, we can't determine this value directly.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Understanding the problem
We are given the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards) of Billie's bedroom. We need to find the perimeter of the room.

Step 2: Calculate the width
First, let's find the width of the bedroom. We know that the area of a rectangle is length * width. We have the length (3 yards), so we can solve for the width: width = area / length

width = 360 square feet / 3 yards
width = 120 feet

Step 3: Calculate the perimeter
The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width)

perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
perimeter = 2 * (3 yards + 120 feet)

Step 4: Convert yards to feet
3 yards is equal to 3 * 36 feet = 108 feet
So, the length is 108 feet and the width is 120 feet.

perimeter = 2 * (108 feet + 120 feet)
perimeter = 2 * (228 feet)
perimeter = 456 feet

Step 5: The final answer
{The final answer is 456 feet}</s>","The length of the room is 3 yards * (3 feet / 1 yard) = <<3*(3/1)=9>>9 feet.
The width of the room is 360 square feet / 9 feet = <<360/9=40>>40 feet.
The room's perimeter is 2(40+9) = 98

                 [/INST] Let's find out how many beads each sister bought and compare their quantities:

Elizabeth bought:
1 pack of red beads: 1 × 20 = 20 red beads
2 packs of clear beads: 2 × 20 = 40 clear beads
Total beads for Elizabeth: 20 red + 40 clear = 60 beads

Margareth bought:
3 packs of blue beads: 3 × 20 = 60 blue beads
4 packs of red beads: 4 × 20 = 80 red beads
Total beads for Margareth: 60 blue + 80 red = 140 beads

Now, let's find the difference in beads:
Difference in beads = Beads for Margareth - Beads for Elizabeth
                             = 140 beads - 60 beads
                             = 80 beads

{The final answer is: one sister (Margareth) has 80 more beads than the other (Elizabeth).}</s>","Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs.
So Elizabeth bought 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 pieces of beads.

Step 2: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, during which time the oven raises the house's temperature. For every hour the oven is on, it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees. So, for 3 hours, the house's temperature increases by 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees. House temperature is now 15 + 40 = <<15+40=55>>55 degrees.

Step 3: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The window is open for half an hour, so it's equivalent to 0.5 hours. For every 10 minutes the window is open, the house cools down by 2 degrees.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the time Jon took for each part of the triathlon.

Swim: 40 minutes
Bike: 1 hour + 20 minutes = 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
Run: 50 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time James took for the swim. Since he finished 10% faster than Jon, we find 10% of 40 minutes and subtract it from Jon's swimming time:

Time difference = 10% of 40 minutes
Time difference = 0.1 * 40
Time difference = 4 minutes

James' swimming time = 40 minutes - 4 minutes
James' swimming time = 36 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the time difference in biking. James took 5 minutes longer than Jon:

James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 85 minutes

Step 4: Since Jon won by 10 minutes, find the time difference in running:

Total race difference = Jon's running time - James' running time
Total race difference = 50 minutes - (James'running time)

Step 5: Solve for James' running time:

Subtract the total race difference from Jon's running time:
James' running time = 50 minutes - 10 minutes
James' running time = 40 minutes

Therefore, James takes 40 minutes to complete the run.

The final answer is: James takes 40 minutes to do the run.</s>","Jon did the bike ride in 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes

Now we know MovieB = MovieC + 5 minutes = 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes.

Step 3: Using the information from Step 1 and Step 2, we can calculate the length of Movie A in minutes:

                 [/INST] To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay for his horse, we need to calculate first how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes and then how many bails of hay that requires and finally the cost of that amount of hay and the change Michael will have.

1. Calculate the number of miles the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32MPH. We know that:
   1 mile = 5280 feet
   1 hour = 60 minutes
   1 minute = 60 seconds

   To find the distance the horse covers in 30 minutes, we need to calculate the number of feet that is covered in 30 minutes at the given speed and then convert it to miles.

   First, convert the hours to minutes: 30 minutes = 30 * 60 = 1800 seconds.

   Find the number of feet covered in 1800 seconds:

   Distance = Speed * Time
   Distance = 32MPH * 1800 seconds / (60 minutes/hour * 5280 feet/mile)

2. Calculate the number of bails of hay required:

   Hay required = Distance / Distance per bail
   Distance per bail = 1 mile

   Hay required = Total Distance / Distance per bail
   Hay required = (Distance) / 1

3. Find the cost of the hay:

   Total Cost = Cost per Bail * Number of Bails

4. Find the change Michael has:

   Change = Money Spent on Hay - Money Michael Has.

   Let's assume Michael has six $5 bills.
   Money Michael Has = 6 * $5

Now let's calculate it step by step:

1. To find the number of miles the horse runs in 30 minutes, first, we'll find how far the horse can go in 1 minute:
   32 MPH = 5280 feet per mile
   Speed = 5280 feet per mile * 32 miles per hour -> 167,664 feet per hour.
   Now we convert minutes to seconds: 1 minute = 60 seconds

   We need to figure out how far the horse goes in 30 minutes at this speed:

   Distance = Speed * Time
   Distance = 167,664 feet per hour * 1800 seconds / 60 minutes

2. Find how many bails of hay are required:

   Hay required = (Distance) / 1 mile

3. Find the cost of the hay:

   Cost per Bail = $3
   Total Cost = Cost per Bail * Number of Bails
   Total Cost = $3 * Hay required

4. Find the change Michael has:

   Change = Money Spent on Hay - Money Michael Has
   Let's assume Michael has six $5 bills.
   Money Michael Has = 6 * $5
   Money Spent on Hay = Total Cost

{The final answer is: Change = Money Spent on Hay - Money Michael Has}

Now you need to calculate the actual numerical value of 'Change'. To do that, you should find the exact value of 'Distance' and 'Hay required' then calculate the corresponding 'Total Cost' value. After that, use the equation 'Change = Money Spent on Hay - Money Michael Has' to determine the change Michael has after buying the hay.</s>","The horse runs 16 miles because 32 x (30/60) = <<32*(30/60)=16>>16
The horse needs to eat 8 bails of hay because 16 x .5 = <<16*.5=8>>8
The hay will cost $24 because 8 x $3 = <<8*3=24>>24
Michael has $30 because 6 x $5 = <<6*5=30>>30
Michael has $6 in change because $30 - $24 = $<<30-24=6>>6

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of eggs Rozanne used to make eggnog.
- 4 dozen eggs = 4 * 12 = 48 eggs (since a dozen is 12)
- 48 eggs from cases
- 2 eggs from the cupboard
- Total eggs = 48 + 2 = 50 eggs

Step 2: Determine how many eggs are used in each tray.
- Each glass requires 5 eggs
- A tray holds 5 glasses
- Thus, a tray uses 5 * 5 = 25 eggs

Step 3: Determine how many trays Rozanne can put out.
- Total eggs = 50
- Eggs per tray = 25
- Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray = 50 / 25 = 2 trays (rounded down)

So, {Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog}. The final answer is a whole number of trays, and the calculation shows that she just fits 2 trays with her available eggs. However, if the number of eggs were to increase slightly, she could potentially put out a third tray.

Exercise:
Calculate how many eggs Rozanne would need to make an additional tray of eggnog.

Answer: 
She would need to make 25 more eggs to make an extra tray, which is 25 eggs. However, she has 50 eggs, which is enough for 2 trays, but not quite enough for 3 with only the given 50 eggs. Since the question asks for whole trays, she can't prepare a partial tray with 25 eggs, so she can't make an additional tray given the available eggs. If she had 25 more eggs, she could then make a third tray.</s>","As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.
She therefore has a total of 48 eggs in cases + 2 loose eggs = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs.
So she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.
This means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.

The salesman sold 17 pairs of sneakers at the flash sale for $20 each. So, the number of pairs sold at the flash sale is:

Number of pairs sold at the flash sale = Number of pairs * Sale price per pair
Number of pairs sold at the flash sale = 17 * 1
Number of pairs sold at the flash sale = 17

Step 3: Find the total revenue from the flash sale.
Total revenue from the flash sale = Number of pairs sold * Sale price per pair
Total revenue from the flash sale = 17 * $20
Total revenue from the flash sale = $340

Step 4: Find the number of sneakers sold to the department store.
The number of sneakers sold to the department store is the total number of sneakers bought by the salesman minus the number of sneakers sold at the flash sale.

Number of pairs sold to the department store = Total number of pairs - Number of pairs sold at the flash sale
Number of pairs sold to the department store = 48 - 17
Number of pairs sold to the department store = 31

Step 5: Find the total revenue from selling to the department store.
Total revenue from selling to the department store = Number of pairs sold * Sale price per pair
Total revenue from selling to the department store = 31 * $25
Total revenue from selling to the department store = $775

Step 6: Find the total revenue from all sales.
Total revenue from all sales = Total revenue from flash sale + Total revenue from department store
Total revenue from all sales = $340 + $775
Total revenue from all sales = $1,115

Step 7: Find the total cost.
Total cost = Cost of one pair * Number of pairs bought
Total cost = $12.21 * 48
Total cost = $576

Step 8: Calculate the profit.
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1,115 - $576
Profit = $539

The final answer is: {The salesman's profit was $539}.</s>","The salesman made 17 × $20 = $<<17*20=340>>340 at the flash sale on Monday.
There were 48 - 17 = <<48-17=31>>31 sneakers left.
At the department store he made 31 × $25 = $<<31*25=775>>775 throughout the week.
In total he made $340 + $775 = $<<340+775=1115>>1115.
The profit made by the salesman was $1115 - $576 = $<<1115-576=539>>539.

We know that the movie super ticket costs $20, and includes the price of one movie ticket ($12), one popcorn, and one soda (with a $1 extra charge for both). Therefore, the cost of just the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda at regular prices would be:

Cost of movie ticket and popcorn + soda (regular prices): $12 (movie ticket) + x (popcorn) + $3 (soda)

Given that we saved $2 by not buying the movie super ticket, we can set up the equation:

$20 (movie super ticket) > $12 (movie ticket) + x (popcorn) + $3 (soda)

To find the value of x (the regular price of popcorn), subtract $15 (the cost of a movie ticket and a regular-priced soda) from the cost of the movie super ticket, and find the price of the popcorn:

x (popcorn) = $20 (movie super ticket) - $15 (cost of movie ticket + regular soda)

x (popcorn) = $5

{The final answer is: The regular price of popcorn is $5.}</s>","The super ticket costs $20 and for $1 extra I can get a popcorn and a soda, there I'd pay in total $20+$1 = $<<20+1=21>>21

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let x be the cost to fill one balloon before the price increase. Then the cost to fill 200 balloons was $900. So, 200x = $900.
2. Two days later, the cost to fill one balloon increased by $20. This means the new cost to fill one balloon is x + $20.
3. Bentley wanted to fill 170 balloons after the price increase. So, the cost to fill 170 balloons is 170(x + $20).
4. We have one equation from the given information: 200x = $900.
5. To find the cost of filling 170 balloons, we need to find the new cost of filling one balloon first:  x = $900 / 200 = $4.5. So, the cost to fill one balloon after the price increase is $4.5 + $20 = $24.5.
6. Finally, the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase is 170($24.5).

{The final answer is: $4237.00} (Note that this is an approximate answer as the cost of filling the balloons is given in $900 and we assumed that the price increase of $20 remains constant for each balloon filled afterwards. In reality, this might not be the case).</s>","If the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900 before the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon was $900/20=$<<900/20=45>>45

                 [/INST] To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to first find the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then divide the total distance by the total time.

1. First, let's calculate the distance covered during each part of the trip:
   - The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered during this time is 2 hours * 60 mph = 120 miles.
   - Then, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered during this time is 1 hour * 30 mph = 30 miles.
2. Next, we can find the total distance covered during the trip by adding the distance covered in each part: 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.
3. Now, we can find the total time taken during the trip by adding the time spent driving at each speed: 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.
4. To find the average speed during the entire trip, we divide the total distance covered by the total time taken: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade.
Jenna started with 8 sapphires and gave away 3 sapphires in the trade. So, Jenna has:
8 sapphires (initial) - 3 sapphires (given away) = 5 sapphires (remaining)

Step 2: Calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna still has.
The value of a sapphire is $800, and Jenna has 5 sapphires. So, the value of her sapphires is:
5 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $4000

Step 3: Find out how many rubies Jenna received in the trade.
Jenna gave away 3 sapphires and received 2 rubies in exchange. So, she has:
2 rubies (received)

Step 4: Calculate the value of the rubies Jenna has.
The value of a ruby is $1200, and Jenna has 2 rubies. So, the value of her rubies is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Step 5: Find the total value of all of Jenna's jewels.
The value of her sapphires is $4000, and the value of her rubies is $2400. So, the total value of all her jewels is:

1. First, let's calculate the volume of one raised bed:
Width × Length × Height = 2 feet × 8 feet × 2 feet = 16 cubic feet

2. Since there are 10 raised beds, the total amount of soil Bob needs is:
Total volume = Number of raised beds × Volume of one raised bed = 10 beds × 16 cubic feet/bed = 160 cubic feet

3. Since each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, the number of bags he needs is:
Number of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag = 160 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 80 bags

4. The cost for one bag of potting soil is $12, so the total cost for 80 bags is:

1. We know there are 15 red cards in the deck.
2. The proportion of green cards is given as 60%, so there are 15 * 0.6 = 9 red cards.
3. Since there are equal numbers of yellow cards as the sum of red and green cards, and there are 15 red cards and 9 green cards, there must be 15 + 9 = 24 yellow cards.

Therefore, the total number of cards is:

1. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. So the number of puppies with spots from Jennifer's dog is: 3.

2. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots. So the number of puppies with spots from Brandon's dog is: 4.

3. The total number of puppies with spots is the sum of the number of puppies with spots from each dog: 3 (from Jennifer's dog) + 4 (from Brandon's dog) = 7.

4. To find the percentage of all the puppies with spots, we need to find the ratio of the number of puppies with spots to the total number of puppies:

Total number of puppies = number of puppies from Jennifer's dog + number of puppies from Brandon's dog
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Percentage of puppies with spots = (number of puppies with spots / total number of puppies) * 100

Weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 pound/box * 2 boxes = 4 pounds
Weight of carrots = 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds/bag * 4 bags = 192 pounds
Weight of hay = 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
Weight of oats = 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Total weight of all the feed = 4 pounds (sugar cubes) + 192 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 4316 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many trips the farmer needs to make with his truck to transport this amount of feed. Since the truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we can find the number of trips as follows:

Number of trips = Total weight of all the feed / Weight that the truck can carry at a time

Number of trips = 4316 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip

1. Grayson drinks three aluminum cans of soda a week, so she recycles three aluminum cans. Each aluminum can is worth two cents, so she earns 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 cents from recycling aluminum cans each week.
2. Grayson drinks five plastic bottles of water a week, so she recycles five plastic bottles. Each plastic bottle is worth three cents, so she earns 5 * 3 = <<5*3=15>>15 cents from recycling plastic bottles each week.
3. To find out how many cents Grayson earns in a week from recycling both aluminum cans and plastic bottles, we need to add the amounts she earns from each type: 6 cents (aluminum) + 15 cents (plastic) = <<6+15=21>>21 cents.
4. Grayson recycles in a four-week month. So, she earns 21 cents a week * 4 weeks = <<21*4=84>>84 cents in a month.

{The final answer is 84 cents}.</s>","Grayson earns 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 cents from soda cans a week.

                 [/INST] Let's solve this step by step:

First, we need to find out how much Becky paid for the 20 apples. She bought them at 45 cents each, so the total cost for Becky is:

Cost for Becky = Number of apples * Price per apple
Cost for Becky = 20 apples * 45 cents/apple
Cost for Becky = $9

Since Becky received a $1 discount, the actual amount she paid is:

Amount paid by Becky = Cost for Becky - Discount
Amount paid by Becky = $9 - $1
Amount paid by Becky = $8

Now, let's find out how much Kelly paid for the 20 apples before applying the discount. She bought them at 50 cents each, so the total cost for Kelly before the discount is:

Cost for Kelly (before discount) = Number of apples * Price per apple
Cost for Kelly (before discount) = 20 apples * 50 cents/apple
Cost for Kelly (before discount) = $10

Next, we need to calculate the discount Kelly received:

Discount for Kelly = Price before discount * Discount percentage
Discount for Kelly = $10 * 10%
Discount for Kelly = $10 * 0.1
Discount for Kelly = $1

Finally, we can calculate how much Kelly paid after the discount:

Amount paid by Kelly = Cost for Kelly (before discount) - Discount
Amount paid by Kelly = $10 - $1
Amount paid by Kelly = $9

Now we can compare the amounts paid by both girls:

Difference in cost = Amount paid by Kelly - Amount paid by Becky
Difference in cost = $9 - $8
Difference in cost = $1

{The final answer is: Kelly paid $1 more than Becky.}</s>","Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9
With the discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $<<9-1=8>>8.
Before the discount Kelly would have paid 20 apples x $0.50/apple = $<<20*0.5=10>>10
With a 10 percent discount Kelly paid ($10 x 10)/100 = $<<(10*10)/100=1>>1 less
In total Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $<<10-1=9>>9.
Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $<<9-8=1>>1 more than Becky.

1. Two sheets = 2
2. One comforter = 1
3. Twice as many pillow cases as sheets = 2 * 2 = 4
4. Twice as many towels as pillow cases = 4 * 2 = 8

So, the total number of pieces of laundry for one room is: 2 (sheets) + 1 (comforter) + 4 (pillow cases) + 8 (towels) = 15.

Now, to find out the number of pieces of laundry for all 80 rooms, we multiply the number of items in one room by the number of rooms:

4. He gains 30 new pairs of shoes on Friday, so he has 230 + 30 * 2 = 280 shoes on Friday.
5. He gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday. So, Frank has 280 - 180 = 100 shoes on Saturday.
6. Since no new shoes are added on Sunday, Frank will have 100 shoes on Sunday.

The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300

2. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils have been used. So, the number of pencils that have been used is: 300 pencils × 1/5 = 600/5 = 120 pencils.

3. Therefore, at this point, there are 300 pencils (initial number) - 120 pencils (used) = 180 pencils remaining.

4. At the end of the school year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left at the end of the school year is: 180 pencils × 1/3 = 60 pencils.

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks as x. According to the problem, Matt can have half that number of cookies, plus two. Mathematically, this can be written as:

Number of cookies = 0.5 * Number of carrot sticks + 2

We know that Matt wants to eat a total of five cookies. Setting up the equation, we get:

5 = 0.5x + 2

To solve this equation, we first need to isolate x. Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

3 = 0.5x

Now, we need to find the value of x. To do this, we can divide both sides by 0.5:

x = 3 / 0.5
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to be able to have five cookies. {The final answer is 6 carrot sticks}.</s>","First subtract the two cookies Matt gets for cleaning his room from the total number he wants to eat: 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3

                    question:
                    Benny saw a 10-foot ; shark with 2 6-inch . remoras attached to it. , What percentage of ! the shark's body : length is the combined length , of : the remoras?
                 [/INST] Let's first calculate the total length of the shark with the 2 remoras attached:

1. The length of the shark is 10 feet.
2. Each remora is 6 inches long.
3. So, the combined length of the 2 remoras is 2 * 6 inches = 12 inches.
4. Since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, the combined length of the remoras is 12 inches = 1 foot.

Now we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that is occupied by the combined length of the remoras:

1. The length of the shark is 10 feet = 10 * 12 inches = 120 inches.
2. The combined length of the remoras is 1 foot = 12 inches.
3. To find the percentage, we divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and then multiply by 100.
4. (1 foot / 120 inches) * 100% = 1%

So the final answer is: The percentage of the shark's body length that is occupied by the combined length of the remoras is 1%.</s>","First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<6*2=12>>12 inches
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1=1>>1 foot
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 10 feet * 100% = 10%

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the number of students at a certain grade level as x. We know that three-fourths of these students have desktop computers at home. So, the number of students with desktop computers can be represented as (3/4)x.

Step 2: We are told that 20 students do not have desktop computers. Therefore, the number of students without desktop computers can be represented as 20.

Step 3: Using the principle of subtraction, we find the total number of students by subtracting the number of students without desktop computers from the number of students with desktop computers: x = (3/4)x + 20.

Step 4: To find the value of x, we need to solve the quadratic equation x = (3/4)x + 20. Dividing both sides by (1 - 3/4 = 1/4), we get x = 20 * 1/4 + 3x/4.

Step 5: Simplifying, we get 3x/4 = 5x/2. Cross-multiplying, we get x = 20 * 4 / 3.

                 [/INST] To determine how long Jason needs to walk each day to break in his new shoes in time for tryouts, we first need to figure out how many minutes he has in total before the tryouts.

1. We know that it takes 240 minutes to break in a new pair of shoes.
2. The tryouts are in three weeks, so we need to find out how many minutes that is.

First, let's find out how many days are in three weeks:
```
3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days
```

Next, let's find out how many minutes are in those 21 days. We'll assume each day has 1440 minutes (24 hours * 60 minutes) for simplicity:
```
21 days * 1440 minutes/day = 297,120 minutes
```

Now, we need to determine how many of those minutes Jason can use to break in his shoes by walking 4 days a week.
```
4 days/week * 1440 minutes/day = 5760 minutes/week
 240 minutes/pair * ( weeks/pair )/( weeks/tryouts ) = 128 pairs/tryouts
 128 pairs/tryouts * 5760 minutes/week/pair = 716,928 minutes for 128 pairs
```

Since it takes 240 minutes to break in one pair of shoes, we need to divide the total time needed to break in all the pairs by the time it takes to break in one pair.

Jason has 716,928 minutes for breaking in 128 pairs, so the time he requires for one pair is:
```
716,928 minutes / 128 pairs = 5,620.5 minutes
We'll round this value up to 5,621 minutes, as Jason would rather spend a little more time than necessary to ensure the shoes are completely broken in.
```

Finally, since Jason can walk for 4 days a week, the amount of minutes he needs to spend walking each day is:
```
5,621 minutes/pair / 4 days/week = 1,395 minutes/day

{The final answer is: Jason needs to spend 1,395 minutes, or approximately 2 hours and 23 minutes, walking each day to break in his new shoes before tryouts.}</s>","First find how many days Jason has to prepare for the tryouts: 3 weeks * 4 days/week = <<3*4=12>>12 days

1. Sarah spent $300 on books.
2. Each book cost $15.
3. To find the total number of books Sarah bought, we division thetotal spending by the cost per book:

Total number of books = Total spending / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Now that we know Sarah bought 20 books, we can find out how many books each child got by dividing the total number of books by the number of children:

Number of books for each child = Total number of books / Number of children
Number of books for each child = 20 / 4
Number of books for each child = 5

3. There are 3 kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

So, the number of kids with allergies to dairy or peanuts is 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) - 3 (both) = 12.

Given there are 32 kids in total in the class. We can find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything by subtracting the number of allergic kids from the total number of kids:

3. Therefore, Jaime can place 24 eggs on each tray.
4. In total, Jaime can place 24 * 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 eggs on both trays.
5. However, Jaime has 64 eggs, so he can't place all of them in the two trays.
6. To find out how many eggs he can't place, subtract the number of eggs he can place on the trays from the total number of eggs he has.

Since the family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza and the small pizza costs $8, we can calculate the cost of the family-size pizza as follows:

Family-size pizza cost = Small pizza cost * 3
Family-size pizza cost = $8 * 3
Family-size pizza cost = $24

Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent by Sally.
Sally spends $8 on the small pizza and $24 on the family-size pizza. So, the total amount spent by Sally is:

Total amount spent = Small pizza cost + Family-size pizza cost
Total amount spent = $8 + $24
Total amount spent = $32

1 razor pack = $4.00
So, the cost of 1 razor = $4.00 / pack * 1 razor = $4.00

Step 2: Determine the cost of buying 2 razor packs during the sale.
2 packs = 2 * $4.00/pack = $8.00

Step 3: Apply the buy one get one free sale.
The total amount paid for 2 packs = $8.00
Since one pack is free during the buy one get one free sale, the actual cost for Heather is $8.00 - $4.00 = $4.00

Step 4: Apply the $2.00 coupon.
Total cost after coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Therefore, each individual razor costs 2.00 cents after the discount.

                 [/INST] To find the height of the human pyramid, we first need to calculate the height of each level of the pyramid in terms of the height of one cheerleader.

1. Height of the bottom level: Since there are 4 girls at this level, we can find the height by multiplying the height of one cheerleader by the number of cheerleaders in this level.
Height of bottom level = Height of one cheerleader * Number of cheerleaders
Height of bottom level = 64 inches * 4
Height of bottom level = 256 inches

2. Height of the second level: There are 3 girls on this level. Since they are standing on the shoulders of the 4 girls below them, the height of this level is the same as the height of one cheerleader plus the height of one level of the pyramid below.
Height of second level = Height of one cheerleader + Height of bottom level
Height of second level = 64 inches + 256 inches
Height of second level = 312 inches

3. Height of the third level: There is only one level between this level and the top level, so the height of this level is the same as the height of one cheerleader plus the height of the preceding level.
Height of third level = Height of one cheerleader + Height of second level
Height of third level = 64 inches + 312 inches
Height of third level = 376 inches

4. Height of the top level: The shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall, so this is the height of the top level.
Height of top level = 60 inches

5. Total height of the pyramid: To find the total height of the pyramid, we simply add the heights of each level together.
Total height of pyramid = Height of bottom level + Height of second level + Height of third level + Height of top level
Total height of pyramid = 256 inches + 312 inches + 376 inches + 60 inches
Total height of pyramid = 994 inches

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:
1. Charisma works for 8 hours every day. This means she spends 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day at work.
2. She takes a 5-minute walk every hour. So, during each workday, she goes for a walk 8 times * 5 minutes/time = 40 minutes.
3. After 5 workdays, she has spent a total of 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes at work.
4. During these 5 workdays, she took a 5-minute walk on each of the 8 hours/day * 5 days = 40 walks * 5 minutes/walk = 200 minutes.
5. Therefore, the total number of minutes Charisma has walked during the 5 workdays is the sum of the 2400 minutes she spent at work and the 200 minutes she spent walking: 2400 + 200 = 2600 minutes.

                 [/INST] To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to have equal cost, we need to calculate the total cost for each venue with a given number of guests and then compare them.

Let's first calculate the total cost for the first venue with x guests:
Total cost for the first venue = Flat fee + Cost of food
Total cost for the first venue = $200 + ($5 * x)

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the second venue with y guests:
Total cost for the second venue = Cost per person + Cost of food (included in the price)
Total cost for the second venue = $25 * y

To find the number of guests where the two costs are equal:

$200 + ($5 * x) = $25 * y

First, let's solve for y in terms of x:

$200 + ($5 * x) = $25 * y

$200 + ($5 * x) = 25y

$200 + ($5 * x) = 25y

$200 = 25y - 5x

y = ((200 + 5x)/25)

Next, we can find the number of guests where the two costs are equal:

Let's set x = 0 and find y:

y = ((200 + 5*0)/25)

y = 8

So, for 8 guests, the first venue ($200) and the second venue ($25*8 = $200) have the same cost.

However, since x represents the number of guests, Mark cannot invite only 8 guests to the first venue as it requires a minimum number of guests (the flat fee is charged regardless of the number of attendees).

Therefore, it's not possible to have an equal cost for the two venues with a given number of guests. The number of guests required to make the costs equal is not defined in this problem.

So, in conclusion, {The final answer is no solution exists in this case because the first venue has a flat fee which does not depend on the number of guests, while the second venue charges per person.}</s>","The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.

                 [/INST] Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43.
2. We're given the information that Lily found 7 more insects than David. Let's denote the number of insects David found as D. Then, the number of insects Lily found is D + 7.
3. We're also given that David found half of what Bodhi found. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Then, the number of insects David found is B/2.
4. Using the given information that the total number of insects they all found is 43, we can write the equation: D + (D + 7) + B = 43.
5. Since we don't have enough information to find the exact values of D and B, let's express each in terms of the other. We know that D = B/2, so we can rewrite the equation as: B/2 + B + B = 43.
6. Combining the terms on the left side, we get 3B = 43.
7. Dividing by 3, we find that B = 14.33 (approximately). However, since we can't have a fraction of an insect, this equation does not have a valid solution.
8. Therefore, the given information does not allow us to determine the exact number of insects Lily and David found. {There is no final answer.}</s>","Let B = the number of insects Bodhi collected
David = B/2
Lily = B/2 + 7
B + B + 7 = 43

David = 18/2 = <<18/2=9>>9 insects

Mariah's yards = (1/4) * 364

Step 2: Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. So, the number of yards her grandma used is (1/2) * 364 (yards in a skein).

Grandma's yards = (1/2) * 364

Step 3: To find the total number of yards used, add the number of yards Mariah used to the number of yards her grandma used.

Total yards = Mariah's yards + Grandma's yards

Total yards = (1/4) * 364 + (1/2) * 364

First, find the value of each term:

Mariah's yards = 0.25 * 364 = 91 yard
Grandma's yards = 0.5 * 364 = 181 yards

Now, add the yields to get the total yards:

So, the equation for the width of the couch is:
width of the couch = 10 + 2 * (width of the rug)

Now, we need to find the length of the couch. Since the problem doesn't provide enough information about the relationship between the width and length of the rug or the couch, it's impossible to determine the exact length of the couch based on the given information alone.

If she paid $7 in all, ; how many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum, and 2 of those were strawberry. So she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum.
2. The cost of 2 packs of Suzie's favorite flavor (strawberry) was $2 each. So, the cost of one pack of strawberry gum is $2. (Note that this information is given later in the problem, but we can use it to help us find the answer to the original question.)
3. The cost of a pack of grape gum was $2.
4. Suzie bought a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of a regular pack, and she paid $7 in total.
5. Let x be the cost of a regular pack of gum (either strawberry or grape). Then, the cost of a small pack of green apple gum is x/2.
6. We know that the cost of 2 packs of strawberry gum is $4 (since each pack costs $2), and the cost of a pack of grape gum is $2. The cost of the small pack of green apple gum is $3.5 (half the cost of a regular pack).
7. The total cost of all the gum Suzie bought is $7.
8. Therefore, we have the equation 2x + x + x/2 + 3.5 = 7, where x is the cost of a regular pack of gum.
9. Solving this equation, we find that x = $2.
10. The final answer is: Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.</s>","The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.

                 [/INST] To find out how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make with a budget of $24, we need to determine how many sticks he can get from each size of wood and which option is cheaper per stick.

1. From a 2 x 4 piece of wood:
   Frederick can get 200 sticks, and a 2 x 4 costs $4. So, the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02.

2. From a 2 x 8 piece of wood:
   Frederick can get 400 sticks, and a 2 x 8 costs $6. So, the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015.

Since the cost per stick from a 2 x 8 piece of wood is lower than from a 2 x 4 piece, it would be more cost-effective for Frederick to buy the 2 x 8 piece of wood.

Now let's determine how many sticks Frederick can make with his $24 budget by buying a 2 x 8 piece of wood:

$24 can buy: $24 / $6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood

3. Calculate the cost of the weekly bus pass:
Weekly bus pass cost = $20

4. Compare the cost of taking bus trips every week with the cost of the weekly bus pass:

Savings per week = (Cost of bus trips per week) - (Weekly bus pass cost)

1. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes as Sophia.

2. Let's denote the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought as x and y, respectively.

3. Then, the number of onions and potatoes that Rose bought would be 4x and 4y.

4. According to the problem, Rose bought 12x onions and 4y potatoes.

5. Set up the equation to represent the relation between the number of onions and potatoes that both Sophia and Rose bought:

x := number of onions Sophia bought
y := number of potatoes Sophia bought
4x := number of onions Rose bought
4y := number of potatoes Rose bought

Now we have the system of equations:
x = (1/4) * (number of onions Rose bought)
y = (1/4) * (number of potatoes Rose bought)

From the problem, we know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes:

12x = (1/4) * (12 * number of onions Rose bought)
x = (1/4) * (12 * number of onions Rose bought) * (1)
x = (3 * number of onions Rose bought)
x = 3 * number of onions Sophia bought (since x is the number of onions Sophia bought)

Similarly, we can find the number of potatoes Sophia bought:

4y = (1/4) * (4 * number of potatoes Rose bought)
y = (1 * number of potatoes Rose bought)
y = number of potatoes Sophia bought

So, we have:
x = 3 * number of onions Sophia bought
y = number of potatoes Sophia bought

To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought at the market, we don't have enough information to determine the specific number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. All we know is their relationship to the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought.

Step 1: Find out how many days Andy has until his birthday.
The difference between Andy's birthday and today is:
| July 19 - December 31 |
= | 227 |

Step 2: Calculate how many calories Andy needs to burn to reach his goal weight.
Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound. So, to lose 30 lbs., he needs to burn:
30 lbs. × 3500 calories/lb. = 105,000 calories

Step 3: Divide the total calories Andy needs to burn by the number of days he has to reach his goal.
Calorie deficit per day = Total calories needed ÷ Number of days
Calorie deficit per day = 105,000 calories ÷ 227 days ≈ 463 calories/day

Step 4: Verify if the calorie deficit per day meets the requirement for weight loss.
To ensure that Andy is indeed creating a calorie deficit, check if his current calorie intake is greater than 463 calories/day:

                    question:
                    Gerald works at a daycare ; that pays him $30 every day. He : worked for an entire week and spent a total of $100. How much does he have left?
                 [/INST] Let's first calculate how much Gerald earned during an entire week. We know that he makes $30 per day, so a week with 7 days would amount to:

Earnings in one week = Daily earnings * Number of days in a week
= $30 * 7
= $210

However, the problem states that Gerald only had a total of $100 left. This means that Gerald spent $110 more than he earned during that week.

To find out how much Gerald spent, we can subtract his earned amount from the total amount spent:

Amount spent = Amount earned + Unaccounted for cost
= $210 + $110
= $320

Since we know that the total amount spent was $320 and Gerald doesn't have that much money, let's find out what he has left by subtracting his known expenses – what he was paid for working at the daycare – from the total amount spent.

Money left = Total amount spent - Earned amount
= $320 - $210
= $110

However, we made a mistake in the initial calculation of Gerald's earnings for an entire week. The correct calculation is:

Earnings in one week = Daily earnings * Number of days in a week
= $30 * 7
= $210

Given that Gerald spent an additional $110 and only had $100 left, it is not possible for him to have any money left. In fact, Gerald has a deficit of $10. To clarify:

Gerald earned $210 during that week. He also spent $220, leaving him with a shortage of $110. Since he only had $100, he was $10 short. Thus, Gerald had a debt of $110 and had to come up with that amount or borrow it to meet his obligations.

The final answer: Gerald had a debt of $110 and a shortage of $10, amounting to a deficit of $120.</s>","He earns $30 daily for a week (7 days) for a total earnings of $30*7 = $<<30*7=210>>210

                 [/INST] Let's denote the cost of the lot as L. According to the problem, the cost of the house is three times the cost of the lot, so the cost of the house is 3L.

The total cost of the house and the lot is given as $120,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

L (cost of lot) + 3L (cost of house) = $120,000

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:

4L = $120,000

To find the value of L, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4:

L = $30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot is $30,000, we can find the cost of the house by using the given relationship:

Cost of house = 3L = 3 * $30,000 = $90,000

So, the cost of the house is $90,000.

{The final answer is: The house costs $90,000.}</s>","Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.

Step 2: Find the selling price of one bag.
She sold each bag for $8.

Step 3: Find the profit per bag.
Profit per bag is the difference between the selling price and the cost price. So profit per bag = selling price - cost price = $8 - $4 = $<<8-4=4>>4.

Next, we're told that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob. So we need to find out how long it takes Royce by finding the difference between double the time it takes Rob, and the additional 40 minutes.

The time it takes Royce = (2 * Time it takes Rob) + 40 minutes
Substituting the value of Rob's shingling time:

The time it takes Royce = (2 * 120 minutes) + 40 minutes

Calculating this value:

The time it takes Royce = (2 * 120 minutes) + 40 minutes

Now, we can convert this value from minutes to hours:
280 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4.67 hours

Finally, converting hours back to minutes:
4.67 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 276.32 minutes

- He completed 12 problems on Monday.
- He completed 3 times as many problems on Tuesday as he did on Monday. So, he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems on Tuesday.
- In total, Chris completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems by Wednesday night.

Step 2: Determine how many math problems are left for Chris to complete.
- Chris has 100 problems in total.
- He completed 48 problems by Wednesday night.
- So, Chris has 100 - 48 = 52 problems left to complete.

However, Chris is supposed to complete these problems by Thursday. Since Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems on Wednesday, we need to find out how many problems he will complete on Thursday.

Step 3: Determine how many math problems Chris will complete on Thursday.
- Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems on Wednesday. So, he completes 1/4 * 52 = 13 problems on Wednesday.
- This leaves him with 52 - 13 = 39 problems left to complete.

Step 4: Determine if Chris can finish the remaining math problems on Thursday.
- According to the problem, Chris has 100 problems to complete in total.
- After completing 48 problems on Monday and Tuesday, Chris has 39 problems left to complete.
- To find out if Chris can finish the remaining problems on Thursday, we need to find out how many problems he can complete in one night.
- Since Chris completed 12 problems on Monday and 36 problems on Tuesday,we can assume he completes around 28 problems per night on average.
- If Chris completes 28 problems per night and has 39 problems left to complete, he will need 39 / 28 = approximately 1.4 units of work. Since he can't complete a fractional unit of work,he will need to complete an extra portion of work the next day.
- To complete the extra portion of work, he'll need to complete an additional 3 problems every night until he finishes the remaining 39 problems.

Step 5: Determine if Chris can finish the remaining math problems on Thursday.
- Chris's average completion rate per night is 28 problems.
- He has 39 problems left to complete, and he completes an additional 3 problems every night.
- In total, he will need to complete approximately 71 problems (39 + 32) over the course of 2 days.
- Since Chris can only complete 56 problems in 2 days (28 problems per night × 2 nights), he cannot finish all the remaining math problems on Thursday.

                    The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning. They sold 93 loaves : in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. How many ? loaves of bread did they ; have left?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of loaves baked, sold in the morning, sold in the afternoon, and returned.
- Baked: 200 loaves
- Sold in the morning: 93 loaves
- Sold in the afternoon: 39 loaves
- Returned by the grocery store: 6 loaves

Step 2: Calculate the total number of loaves that were sold.
- Sold = Sold in the morning + Sold in the afternoon
- Sold = 93 + 39
- Sold = 132 loaves

Step 3: Subtract the total number of sold loaves from the total number of baked loaves to find out how many loaves were left.
- Left = Baked - Sold
- Left = 200 - 132

Step 4: Perform the calculation
- Left = 68 loaves

{The final answer is: They had 68 loaves of bread left.}</s>","The Bakery sold 93 + 39 = <<93+39=132>>132 loaves.
The Bakery made 200 loaves and sold 132, leaving 200 - 132 = <<200-132=68>>68 loaves remaining.
The grocery store returned 6 loaves, so there were 6 + 68 = <<6+68=74>>74 loaves left.

                 [/INST] To find the number of rows Jackson will plant, we first need to determine how many flowers (red and blue) he buys in total, and then find out how many flowers can be planted in each row.

Total number of red tulips = 36
Total number of blue tulips = 24

Total number of flowers = Red tulips + Blue tulips
Total number of flowers = 36 + 24
Total number of flowers = 60

Now, let's check how many flowers can be planted in one row with red and blue tulips.

Flowers in one row (red) = number of red tulips in a row
Flowers in one row (red) = 6

Flowers in one row (blue) = number of blue tulips in a row
Flowers in one row (blue) = 8

To find the number of rows needed to plant all the red and blue tulips, we need to find the highest common divisor of the number of flowers in one row for red and blue.

The highest common divisor of 6 and 8 = 2 (Since 2 is a common factor in both numbers)

So, Jackson will need to plant {30 rows} to plant all 60 tulips (36 red + 24 blue).</s>","First, divide the number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row: 36 / 6 = <<36/6=6>>6 rows.
Next, divide the number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips per row: 24 / 8 = <<24/8=3>>3 rows.
Now add the number of rows of each color to find the total: 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 rows.

First, find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with the entire 27 cups of raisins. Each batch requires 3/4 cup of raisins.

Step 2: Calculate the number of batches of oatmeal cookies.
Number of batches = Total amount of raisins (in cups) / Amount of raisins per batch
Number of batches = 27 cups / (3/4) cup per batch

To find the common denominator for the fractions, we need 1 cup on both sides.

Step 3: Convert the fraction to have a common denominator.
Equivalent fraction: (27 * (1/2)) / (3/4)
Equivalent fraction: 27/2 * (1/2)/(3/4)

Step 4: Simplify the fraction.
Equivalent fraction = 27/6

Number of batches = 27/6

Step 5: Calculate the quotient to find the number of batches.
Number of batches = 27 ÷ 6
Number of batches = 4.5

Since Heather cannot make half a batch, she can only make 4 full batches.

{The final answer is: Heather can make 4 batches of oatmeal cookies.}</s>","Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.

Step 1: Find Ada's daily consumption before adding the new device:
Daily consumption before = 12 kilowatts per hour

Step 2: Find Ada's daily consumption after adding the new device:
Daily consumption after = 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour

Step 3: Calculate the weekly consumption and cost for each consumption level:
Weekly consumption and cost (before) = Daily consumption (before) * 7 days = 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50/kilowatt-hour = $126
Weekly consumption and cost (after) = Daily consumption (after) * 7 days = 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50/kilowatt-hour = $147

Step 4: Find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill:
Difference in weekly bill = Weekly cost (after) - Weekly cost (before) = $147 - $126 = $21

So, {The final answer is $21} for the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill after adding the new device.</s>","Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.

Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.
So her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.
Ada's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147

                 [/INST] To solve this problem, we first need to determine how long it takes one person to paint half a house, and then use that information to find out how long it takes five people to paint a whole house.

1. We know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. To find out how long it takes one person to paint one half of a house, we need to find the daily painting rate.

2. There are 24 hours in a day, so we need to find out how much of a house one person can paint in one day.

3. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, they can paint one half of a house in 5 days * 24 hours/day = <<5*24=120>>120 hours.

4. Therefore, one person can paint one half of a house in 120 hours.

5. Since a whole house consists of two halves, it takes one person 120 hours * 2 = <<120*2=240>>240 hours to paint a whole house.

6. Now, let's see how long it takes 5 people to paint a whole house.

7. If one person can paint a half of a house in 120 hours, then 5 people painting at the same time can paint one half of a house in 120 hours / 5 = <<120/5=24>>24 hours.

8. So, it takes 5 people 24 hours to paint one half of a house, and it takes them 24 hours * 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 hours to paint a whole house.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's first find out how many chairs Jenna has. We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas and Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia has sofas. So,

Jenna's number of chairs = 3 * Ophelia's number of sofas
Jenna's number of chairs = 3 * 20
Jenna's number of chairs = 60

Step 2: We know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than Jenna and Ophelia has 20 sofas. So,

Jenna's number of sofas = Ophelia's number of sofas + 2
Jenna's number of sofas = 20 + 2
Jenna's number of sofas = 22

Step 3: Now we know Ophelia's number of sofas and Jenna's number of sofas, we can calculate their total number of sofas,

Total number of sofas = Ophelia's number of sofas + Jenna's number of sofas
Total number of sofas = 20 + 22
Total number of sofas = 42

Step 4: Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than Jenna and each of them has 2 fewer chairs than sofas, we can calculate Ophelia's number of chairs in terms of her sofas and then find their total number of chairs,

Ophelia's number of chairs = Ophelia's number of sofas - 2
Ophelia's number of chairs = 20 - 2
Ophelia's number of chairs = 18

Now, we know Jenna's number of chairs is 3 times Ophelia's number of sofas,

Jenna's number of chairs = 3 * Ophelia's number of sofas
Jenna's number of chairs = 3 * 20
Jenna's number of chairs = 60

Total number of chairs = Ophelia's number of chairs + Jenna's number of chairs
Total number of chairs = 18 + 60
Total number of chairs = 78

{The final answer is: Ophelia and Jenna have a total of 42 sofas and 78 chairs.}</s>","If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.

The total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 66+22 = <<66+22=88>>88
Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the total number of sofas she has is 66-2 = <<66-2=64>>64 sofas.
The total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is 64+20 = <<64+20=84>>84 sofas

$48 - $4 (Cost of one CD) = $44

Step 3: Find how many CDs Tom could have bought instead.
We know the cost of one CD is $4. To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD:
$44 ÷ $4 = $11
Since Tom can only buy CDs in whole numbers, we round down the number of CDs to the nearest whole number:

                 [/INST] Let's reason through this problem step by step:

1. After the first stop, 8 passengers get off the bus. Let X be the number of passengers on the bus before the first stop. Then, the number of passengers on the bus after the first stop is X - 8.

2. At the first stop, 5 times as many passengers get on the bus as those who got off. So, 5 * 8 = 40 new passengers board the bus, making the final number of passengers after the first stop X - 8 + 40.

3. After the second stop, 21 passengers get off the bus. So, the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is (X - 8 + 40) - 21.

4. Three times fewer passengers get on at the second stop. So, the number of passengers who got on at the second stop is 21 * (1/3) = 7 new passengers.

5. Adding the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop from the previous step and the number of passengers who got on at the second stop from this step, the final number of passengers riding the bus is (X - 8 + 40) - 21 + 7.

Now, we don't have enough information to determine X, so we can't calculate an exact numerical answer. Instead, we have a general equation for the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop:

{The final answer is (X - 8 + 40) - 21 + 7}

To find the specific number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we must know the initial number of passengers (X) on the bus before the first stop.</s>","At the first stop, 5 * 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 passengers get on the bus.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In 5 years, Jame will turn 27, so his age now is 22 (27 - 5).
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
3. Therefore, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 2(Jame's age) - 5.
4. Applying this to what we know about Jame's age now, we have: Jame's cousin's age in 8 years = 2(22) - 5.
5. Simplifying the equation: Jame's cousin's age in 8 years = 44 - 5 = 39.
6. Now we want to find the difference in age between Jame and his cousin, which is Jame's age now (22) and his cousin's age now (39).

The final answer is: Jame is currently 17 years older than his cousin (22 - 39 = -17, but remembering that a negative number means a smaller value, we have the correct answer in its absolute value: 17).</s>","James is 27-5=<<27-5=22>>22 years old

computer cost = $1,100
cost of 2 monitors = x + x = 2x
cost of printer = $400 - cost of computer = $700 - $1,100 = -$700 (This is incorrect, the problem states that Errol paid less for the printer than the computer, so the printer cost should be less than $1,100.)

Therefore, the total cost should be:

$1,100 + 2x + ($700 - cost of each monitor)

Since the total cost is $2,400, we can set up the equation:

$1,100 + 2x + $700 - x = $2,400

Simplifying the equation:

x + $2,100 = $2,400
x = $300

However, the problem seems to have inconsistent information as it states that $400 less was paid for the printer than the computer, but the printer costs more than $400 than the computer, which is not possible.

                    question:
                    Twenty kids went out on a school , trip. In one of the . several activities they participated in, : they were divided into two ; equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys ? went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each. : If the girls : brought an amount equal to the . number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?
                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many seashells were brought back by the boys in total:
20 kids in total, divided into equal groups of boys and girls. So, there are 10 boys. Each boy brought back 60 seashells, so the boys brought back:
10 boys * 60 seashells/boy = 600 seashells in total for the boys

Next, we need to find out how many seashells the girls brought back. We know that they brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys, plus four times as many:

600 seashells for the boys, so the girls brought back:
600 seashells (for boys) + 4 * number of seashells boys brought (per girl)

We can set up an equation to solve for the number of seashells each girl brought back:

600 + 4 * x = total number of seashells
600 + 4x = total

Where x is the number of seashells each girl brought back

To find the value of x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation, so we can subtract 600 from both sides:

4x = total - 600
x = (total - 600) / 4

But we don't have a specific total number of seashells in this problem. We only know that the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many. So, we can express the number of seashells each girl brought back in terms of the number of shells each boy brought back:

x = (2 * 600 + 4 * 600) / 4
x = (2 * 600 + 4 * 600) / 4
x = (1200 + 2400) / 4
x = (3600) / 4
x = 900

However, since there are 10 boys, and we know the total number of kids is 20, the actual number of girls should be 10 also. So, the total number of seashells should be a multiple of 20. In order to find the exact answer, we need to find a number of seashells that results in both equal groups of 10 girls and boys and satisfy the equation in the problem.

{The final answer is not provided in this problem as it would require finding a specific multiple of 20 that works for the given conditions.}</s>","When they divided, each group had 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 students.
The total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10*60 = <<10*60=600>>600
The girls brought four times more seashells than the boys, which is 4*600 = <<4*600=2400>>2400
The total number of seashells brought by the girls is 2400+600 = <<2400+600=3000>>3000
If there were 10 girls, then each girl brought 3000/10 = <<3000/10=300>>300 seashells

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of candies George had originally as x. Then, Nick had 2x candies.

After George ate 5 candies, he was left with x - 5 candies. We're given that he now has 3 candies left. Therefore, x - 5 = 3.

Solving for x, we get x = 8. 

So originally, George had 8 candies and Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Chenny is 10 years old.

Step 2: Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. So, we can find Alyana's age by subtracting 4 years from Chenny's age:
Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4

Step 3: Alyana's age is given as 6 years younger than Chenny. So, we can check if this information is correct by subtracting 6 years from Chenny's age instead of 4 years:
Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 6

Let's check if this is true:
Chenny's age = 10
Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 6
Alyana's age = 10 - 6
Alyana's age = 4

Since Alyana is indeed 4 years younger than Chenny, the information given in the problem is correct.

Step 4: Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. We can find Anne's age by adding 2 years to Alyana's age:
Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2

Step 5: Substitute Alyana's age into the equation:
Anne's age = 4 + 2

Step 6: Perform the calculation:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the thicknesses of each book from the problem statement.
The first book is 31 mm thick, the second book is 50 mm thick, the third book is 4 km... I'm sorry, there seems to be a mistake in the problem, as the thickness of the third book has been given in kilometers instead of millimeters. I assume the thicknesses of all books are given in millimeters.

Step 2: Find the thickness of the third book. Since it is 5 mm less than the second book, we have:
Thickness of the third book = Thickness of the second book - 5 mm
Thickness of the third book = 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm

Step 3: Find the thickness of the fourth book. We know that it is twice as thick as the first book:
Thickness of the fourth book = 2 * Thickness of the first book
Thickness of the fourth book = 2 * 31 mm
Thickness of the fourth book = 62 mm

Step 4: Find the total thickness of the four books:
Total thickness = Thickness of the first book + Thickness of the second book + Thickness of the third book + Thickness of the fourth book
Total thickness = 31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm
Total thickness = 188 mm

Total vlogs made: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Since Emma can make and upload 72 vlogs per month, she still needs to make an additional 18 vlogs to meet her goal. Therefore, the number of vlogs Emma should make in the remaining weeks is 18.

Total amount = Dinner bill + Tip
Total amount = $50 + ($50 * 0.2)
Total amount = $50 + $10
Total amount = $60

Step 2: Determine how much my wife will pay and how much I will pay. Since she wants to evenly split the check, we'll divide the total amount by 2.
My share = Total amount / 2
My share = $60 / 2
My share = $30

Step 3: Calculate my payment, which includes my share and the extra tip amount.
My payment = My share + Tip
My payment = $30 + $10

1. Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. So, each boy gets an equal share of $18/3 = $6.

2. The eldest boy added $5 to his initial share, so now he has $6 + $5 = $11.

3. The next day, he added another $10 to his share. So, his new total is $11 + $10 = $21.

4. He spent $8 from his total. So, his remaining amount is $21 - $8 = $13.

5. He was able to triple the remaining amount after saving more. This means he saved an additional $13 * 3 = $42.

6. Adding the $13 he already had and the $42 he saved, his current total is $13 + $42 = $55.

The final answer is: The eldest boy has a total of $55 now.</s>","Each boy gets $18/3 = $<<18/3=6>>6.

1. Elvis has a monthly savings target of $1125.
2. There are 30 days in a normal month, so we'll assume April has 15 days in the first half and the remaining 15 days in the second half.

3. To calculate the amount Elvis needs to save daily in the first half, we divide his monthly savings target by the number of days in the first half: $1125 / 15 = $75.33 (rounded)

Now we know Elvis needs to save $75.33 daily in the first half. In the second half, he wants to save twice as much daily as he does in the first half.

So,

4. Elvis needs to save $75.33 * 2 = $150.67 daily in the second half of the month to reach his savings target.

Therefore, {The final answer is: Elvis needs to save $150.67 daily in the second half of the month to reach his savings target.}</s>","Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y
Since y is twice as much what he saved in each day of the first half, he saved y/2 in each day of the first half

Cost of oranges = Number of oranges * Price per orange

               = $4.00

Cost of peaches = Number of peaches * Price per peach
               = 6 * $0.75

Total cost of fruits = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
                   = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50
                   = $13.00

Now, we need to find out how much change Verna received when she paid $20.

                 [/INST] To find out how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to find out how many families are contacted in each round.

Ali contacts 3 families directly. Each of these families then contacts 3 other families. So, the first round contacts 3 families + 3 families contacted by each of the 3 families = 3 * (1 + 3) = 3 * 4 = 12 families.

In the second round, each of the 12 families contact 3 other families. So, the second round contacts 12 families + 3 families contacted by each of the 12 families = 12 * (1 + 3) = 12 * 4 = 48 families.

In the third round, each of the 48 families contact 3 other families. So, the third round contacts 48 families + 3 families contacted by each of the 48 families = 48 * (1 + 3) = 48 * 4 = 192 families.

In the fourth round, each of the 192 families contact 3 other families. So, the fourth round contacts 192 families + 3 families contacted by each of the 192 families = 192 * (1 + 3) = 192 * 4 = 768 families.

10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Step 2: Find Mark's initial weight. We know his final weight was 70 pounds, and he lost 30 pounds during his illness. To find his initial weight, we need to subtract his weight loss from his final weight:
70 pounds (final weight) - 30 pounds (weight loss) = 40 pounds (initial weight)

                 [/INST] To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to determine how many toys he needs in total, based on the condition that his playset is five times larger than James's playset.

1. James has 80 toys.
2. Jonathan's playset is five times larger than James's playset.
3. To find out how many toys Jonathan needs, we need to multiply the number of toys James has by 5.
4. To do this calculation, we write the equation:

Number of toys for Jonathan = Number of toys for James * 5

5. Substituting the value of the number of toys for James, we have:

Number of toys for Jonathan = 80 * 5

6. Multiplying the numbers:

Number of toys for Jonathan = 400

Therefore, Jonathan needs 400 toys to have a playset five times larger than James'.

7. However, the problem also mentions that Jonathan currently has fewer toys than he needs. We are asked to find the number of toys he currently has, but this information is not provided in the problem statement.

8. To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we would need to know the difference between the number of toys he needs and the number of toys he already has. But, according to the provided information, this difference (the number of toys he needs to acquire) is not given.

In conclusion, without knowing how many toys Jonathan currently has, we cannot determine that value with the available information in the problem.

The total cost before discount = $11.25 (notebooks) + $0.50 (pens) + $12 (calculator) + $10 (geometry set) = $24.25

Step 2: Calculate the discount: Discount = 10% * $24.25 = $2.425

On a cold day:
- Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

On a hot day:
- Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as it takes on a cold day.

Let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day:

It takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile on a cold day.
On a hot day, it takes Ray 2 minutes more than twice as long to swim a mile, so:

It takes Ray 16 minutes * 2 + 2 = 18 minutes to swim a mile on a hot day.

Now, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day:
- Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, so the time it takes him to swim 3 miles is 16 minutes * 3 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day:
- Ray swims a mile in 18 minutes, so the time it takes him to swim 3 miles is 18 minutes * 3 = 54 minutes.

Finally, we can calculate the difference in time:

The difference in time = Time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day - Time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 54 minutes - 48 minutes = 6 minutes.

{The final answer is Ray takes 6 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.}</s>","Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes

John works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week, so he works for 5 * 4 = <<5*4=20>>20 hours a week.
John gets paid $2 per hour, so he earns $2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>$40 a week.

Step 2: Determine how long it takes John to save $80.
John wants to save $80, so we need to find out how many weeks it will take him to save that amount.
We can set up an equation to represent the situation:
Money saved = Money earned per week * Number of weeks
$80 = $40 * Number of weeks

Step 3: Solve for the number of weeks.
Divide both sides of the equation by $40 to find the number of weeks:
Number of weeks = $80 / $40
Number ofweeks = 2
Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

1. The cost of a foot-long fish sub is $40.
2. The six-inch cold-cut combo costs thrice as much as the six-inch sub. So, we need to find out how much a six-inch sub costs and then multiply that by three to find the cost of three six-inch cold-cut combos.

Let's assume the cost of a six-inch sub is x.
Then, the cost of a six-inch cold-cut combo is 3x.

According to the problem, a six-inch sub costs ""thrice as much"" as a six-inch fish sub. So, we can write the equation:

x = 3 * $6 (Since a foot-long fish sub costs $40, a six-inch sub costs $6)
x = $18

Now we know that a six-inch cold-cut combo costs:
3x = 3 * $18 = $54

So, the total cost of lunch today for a foot-long fish sub and three six-inch cold-cut combos would be:
$40 (foot-long fish sub) + $54 (three six-inch cold-cut combos) = $94

Step 2: Seven buttons have two holes each. So, the number of holes in these seven buttons is 2 * 7 = 14.

Step 3: The rest of the buttons have four holes each. So, the number of holes in the remaining buttons is 4 * (total number of buttons - 7) = 4 * (21 - 7) = 4 * 14 = 56.

Step 4: To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we add the holes in the seven buttons with the holes in the rest of the buttons: Total holes = Holes in 7 buttons + Holes in other buttons = 14 + 56 = 60.

Juan’s doctor ! has , asked : him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. By how many cups ; must Juan reduce his daily coffee intake?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily.
Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount of coffee. The daily recommended amount for an adult is approximately 4 cups. Therefore, Octavia drinks 4 cups / 2 = 2 cups of coffee per day.

Step 2: Determine the number of cups of coffee Juan drinks daily.
Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks 2 cups (Octavia's daily intake) × 10 = 20 cups of coffee per day.

Step 3: Determine the new recommended daily amount of coffee that Juan should consume.
Juan's doctor has asked Juan to reduce his daily coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

Step 4: Calculate the difference between Juan's current daily coffee intake and the new recommended intake.
Juan currently drinks 20 cups of coffee per day, and he should drink only 4 cups per day.
The difference in cups is 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

{The final answer is: Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.}</s>","Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups
Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which translates to 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups
Subtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan’s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups
Juan must therefore reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups

                 [/INST] To solve this problem, we'll go through the following steps:

1. First, we need to understand that the angle of the Great Pyramids from the ground as seen from Sahir's house (32 degrees) is the supplementary angle to the angle between the ground and the line that extends from the tip of the pyramid to the center of the Earth (or sun). Therefore, the angle between the ground and the sun, as seen from the pyramid, is 90 - 32 = 58 degrees.

2. Next, we know that the sun is moving at an angular rate of 5 degrees per hour. In 10 hours, the sun will have traveled an angle of 10 * 5 = 50 degrees.

3. However, we must also account for the angle between the ground and the sun as seen from the pyramid, which is 58 degrees. Adding this to the angle the sun travels in 10 hours (50 degrees), we get a total angle from the ground to the sun of 58 + 50 = 108 degrees.

{The final answer is: The sun will be 108 degrees above the ground when it reaches its highest point in the sky from Sahir's perspective.}</s>","5 degrees an hour for 10 hours 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 degrees

One son is 12 years old, and the other is 12 - 4 = <ins>8</ins> years old.

Step 2: Calculate the number of candles James will need for each son's birthday cake.
Each son will need a different number of candles based on their age. The son who is 12 years old will need: 12 [years] × [Number of candles per year] = <ins>12 × 5</ins> = <ins>60</ins> candles.
The son who is 8 years old will need: 8 [years] × [Number of candles per year] = <ins>8 × 5</ins> = <ins>40</ins> candles.

Step 3: Determine the number of candle packs James will need to buy.
James will need a total of: 60 [candles for the older son] + 40 [candles for the younger son] = <ins>100</ins> candles.
Since each pack contains: 5 [candles per pack], James will need to buy: 100 [candles] / 5 [candles per pack] = <ins>20</ins> packs.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the candles.
Each pack costs: $3 [per pack]. Therefore, the total cost for 20 packs is: $3 [per pack] × 20 [packs] = <ins>$60</ins>.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's find out how many minutes Judy reads in a week in the first week. She reads for 15 minutes each night, so in a week (7 days), she reads for:
15 minutes/night × 7 nights/week = 105 minutes/week

Step 2: Now we need to determine how many pages she reads in the first week. We know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, so:
Pages read per minute = 2 pages/minute × (1 minute/1.5 minutes) = 4/3 ≈ 1.33 pages/minute

Step 3: To find out how many pages she reads in a week, we multiply the number of minutes she reads per week by the number of pages she reads per minute:
Pages read per week = 105 minutes/week × 1.33 pages/minute ≈ 140 pages/week

Step 4: In the second week, she reads a total of 100 pages. Let's find out how many minutes that takes:
Minutes taken to read 100 pages = 100 pages / 1.33 pages/minute ≈ 75.5 minutes

Step 5: Since she reads for an entire week (7 days × 24 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour = 5,280 minutes/week), we can find out how many minutes she spends on reading in a week to find out how many pages she reads in two weeks.
Total minutes read in a week = 140 pages/week × 1.33 pages/minute ≈ 187 minutes/week

Since she reads for 15 minutes each night, she spends 15 minutes × 7 nights = 105 minutes/week on reading, so the remaining minutes must be:
Additional minutes read per week = Total minutes read per week – Minutes read per week according to the given information
Additional minutes read per week = (187 minutes/week) - (105 minutes/week) = 82 minutes/week

Step 6: Since there are 2 weeks in a month, and she spends 82 minutes/week reading, she spends 82 minutes/week × 2 weeks = 164 minutes/month reading.

Step 7: To find out how many pages she reads in 164 minutes/month, we first determine her reading speed in pages/minute:
Reading speed = 1 minute/1.5 minutes × 1.33 pages/minute = 0.889 pages/minute

Step 8: Then, we multiply her reading speed by the number of minutes she spends on reading each month to find out how many pages she reads in two weeks:
Pages read in 2 weeks = Reading speed × Total minutes read per month
Pages read in 2 weeks = 0.889 pages/minute × 164 minutes/month ≈ 144 pages

{The final answer is 144 pages}</s>","Every night, Judy reads 15 minutes/1.5 minutes = <<15/1.5=10>>10 sets of 2 pages.
So, she read 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 pages every night in the first week.
In the first week, she reads a total of 20 x 7 = <<20*7=140>>140 pages.
Therefore, she read a total of 140 + 100 = <<140+100=240>>240 pages in two weeks.

2. Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches: (1/4) * 12 = 3 sandwiches

Now, let's subtract the number of sandwiches they ate from the original quantity:

Total number of sandwiches = 12
Sandwiches Cody ate = 4

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the age of Shiloh's nephew as N. We are given that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can write this relationship as:

Shiloh's age (in 7 years) = 3 * Nephew's age

Step 2: Today, Shiloh is 44 years old. In 7 years, he will be 7 years older, so his age will be 51 years (44 + 7). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

51 = 3 * N

Step 3: To find the age of Shiloh's nephew, we need to solve for N:

N = 51 / 3

Step 4: Division by 3 can't be done directly, so we'll need to find a common multiple of 3 for both the numerator (51) and the denominator (3) to perform long division or find the quotient and remainder.

Step 5: The common multiple of 3 for both 51 and 3 is 153 (3 * 17 + 1). So, we'll perform long division: 51 ÷ 3

```
   ___________________
   17 | 51
   ---|--- subtract the first number of the nephew's age (17) from Shiloh's age (51)

   ___________________
   17 | 7
   ---+----------
       0

N = Quotient = 17 (first non-zero digit) = Nephew's age
```

Step 6: The remainder from the long division shows that the nephew's age is not a multiple of 3, but the problem states that ""Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew in 7 years."" This is a contradiction because the nephew's age (as calculated) is a multiple of 3 less than Shiloh's age.

This problem contains an inconsistency and has no valid solution for the given conditions. Therefore, there's no final answer for this problem.</s>","In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = <<44+7=51>>51 years old.

2. Cost of vaccines: $20 (for each vaccine) x 3 (number of vaccines) = $60
3. Cost of broken vases: $12 (cost of each vase) x 4 (number of vases broken) = $48

Now, let's add up these costs to find the total amount Leah has spent on her kitten so far:

                    Ford owns a garden and he grows 40 . roses every week. He supplies Roses to the local flower shops. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third ? flower shop orders 30 roses ; per week. ? How many roses does Ford lack to supply all the flower shops : every month?
                 [/INST] To find out how many roses Ford needs to grow every week to supply all three flower shops, we first need to determine the total number of roses required by all the flower shops.

1. The first flower shop orders 20 roses weekly.
2. The second flower shop orders 15 roses weekly.
3. The third flower shop orders 30 roses weekly.

Therefore, the total number of roses required by all the flower shops every week is:
20 (from the first flower shop) + 15 (from the second flower shop) + 30 (from the third flower shop) = 65 roses per week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to calculate how many roses Ford needs to grow every month in order to supply all the flower shops.

Total number of roses needed every month = Weekly requirement * Number of weeks in a month
Total number of roses needed every month = 65 roses * 4 weeks
Total number of roses needed every month = 260 roses

Now that we know Ford needs to grow 260 roses every month to meet the demand from all the flower shops, we can calculate how many roses more than that he currently grows to find out how many roses he lacks.

From the question, Ford grows 40 . roses every week. We need to find how many roses he falls short of growing every month to meet the demand from all the flower shops.

Monthly requirement = 260 roses
Ford's current weekly production = 40 . roses

Therefore, the number of roses Ford falls short of growing every week is:
Weekly shortage = Monthly requirement - Ford's weekly production
Weekly shortage = 260 roses - 40 . roses
Weekly shortage = 220 . 2 roses (approximately)

Since there are no partial roses, we can assume Ford needs to produce an additional 221 roses every week to meet the demand from the flower shops.

Let's calculate how many roses Ford falls short of growing every month:
Monthly shortage = Weekly shortage * Number of weeks in a month
Monthly shortage = 221 roses * 4 weeks
Monthly shortage = 884 roses

Thus, Ford falls short of growing 884 roses every month to meet the demand from all the flower shops.

{The final answer is Ford lacks 884 roses every month to supply all the flower shops.}</s>","The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.
The second flower shop needs 15 x 4= <<15*4=60>>60 roses every month.

So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
The total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160
Therefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.

Katina removes $100 each month, so in total she will remove:

$100/month * 24 months = $2400

Step 2: Subtract the total amount Katina removed from her initial savings balance to find out how much will be remaining.

Bread cost per loaf = $3.00
Number of sandwiches made from 1 loaf = 10
So, cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = Bread cost per loaf * Number of sandwiches = $3.00 * 10 = $30.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost of cheese and condiments for making 10 sandwiches.
Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00

1. Each muffin is made from 8 small pieces of crayons.
2. Therefore, the number of muffins Kate can make is equal to the number of sets of 8 small pieces she has.
3. Since Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, the total number of small pieces she has is: 3 boxes * 64 pieces/box = 192 pieces.
4. To find the number of sets of 8 pieces, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a set (8): 192 pieces / 8 pieces/set = 24 sets of 8 pieces.

Now that we know Kate can make 24 muffins, we can calculate how much money she can make from selling them:

First, let's calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:

The cost per square foot for the new carpet is $12, and the cost per square foot for padding is $2. since the bedroom is 18 feet long and 12 feet wide, the area of the bedroom is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

Cost of new carpet = $12/square foot * 216 square feet = $2592
Cost of padding = $2/square foot * 216 square feet = $432

So, the cost of new carpet and padding is $2592 + $432 = $2624

Next, let's calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:

Cost of removing old carpet = $4/square foot * 216 square feet = $864

Finally, let's calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:

Cost of installing new carpet = $34/square foot * 216 square feet = $7379.2

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total cost of replacing the carpet:

Total cost = $2624 (new carpet and padding) + $864 (removal of old carpet) + $7379.2 (installation of new carpet)

The final answer is: $10,877.2

Therefore, it would cost Michael approximately $10,877.2 to replace the carpet in his bedroom.</s>","The room measures 18 * 12 = <<18*12=216>>216 square feet.

The new carpet padding costs $2 * 216 = $<<2*216=432>>432.
To remove the old carpet, the contractor will charge $4 * 216 = $<<4*216=864>>864.
To install the new carpet, the contractor will charge $34 * 216 = $<<34*216=7344>>7,344.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Diane started with a number train having a value of 20.
2. She added half of the number to the starting value:
   a. Half of the number train = Number train / 2
   b. Starting value + Half number = 20 + (Number train / 2)

3. The resulting value was divided by 5:
   a. Resulting value = (20 + (Number train / 2)) / 5

4. The final step was to multiply the starting value by the resulting value minus 12:
   a. Final value = 20 * [(20 + (Number train / 2)) / 5 - 12]

To find the value of the number train, we need to solve for it in the final equation:

1. Isolate the Number train term:
   a. Final value = 20 * [(20 + x) / 5 - 12]

2. Multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the denominator:
   a. 5 * Final value = 20 * ((20 + x) / 5 - 12)

3. Distribute the multiplication on the right side:
   a. 5 * Final value = 20 * (20 / 5 + x / 5 - 12)

4. Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
   a. 5 * Final value = 20 * (4 + x / 5 - 12 / 5)

5. Subtract 12 / 5 from 4:
   a. 5 * Final value = 20 * (4 - (4 / 5)) * (1 + x / 5)

6. Multiply 20 and (1 + x / 5):
   a. 5 * Final value = 20(1 + x / 5) * 4

7. Distribute the multiplication:
   a. 5 * Final value = 80 + 20x / 5

8. Multiply both sides by 5:
   a. 5 * Final value * 5 = 400 + 20x

9. Rearrange the terms to solve for the number train:
    a. 20x = 5 * Final value * 5 - 400

So, the final equation is:

{The final answer is 20x = 5 * Final value * 5 - 400}

This equation should be solved using algebra to find the value of the number train, assuming that only one valid solution exists. Note that this problem may not have a unique solution depending on the value of Final value.</s>","If Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20, half the number is 1/2*20=<<20-10=10>>10

This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5, giving a total of 30/5 = <<30/5=6>>6
The starting value minus 12 is 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8

                 [/INST] To find out the new temperature Maggie should set her oven to when her recipe calls for 520 degrees, we first need to find out the percentage by which her oven is off.

Step 1: Find the percentage by which the oven is off.

The oven is set at 450 degrees but the actual temperature is 468 degrees. The difference between the two temperatures is 18 degrees. To find the percentage, we can use the following formula:

% error = | (actual temperature - set temperature ) / set temperature | x 100 %

First, we need to find the absolute difference: | 468 - 450 | = 18

Then, we can find the percentage error:

% error = | 18 / 450 | x 100 % = 4.0 %

So the oven is 4.0% hotter than it is set to be.

Step 2: Determine the new temperature.

Now that we know the percentage error, we can find the new temperature Maggie should set her oven to when her recipe calls for 520 degrees:

new temperature = 520 x (1 + percentage error)

new temperature = 520 x (1 + 0.04)

new temperature = 520 x 1.04

new temperature = 544.8

Since it is not possible to set an oven to a decimal value, we will round up to the nearest 5 degree increment:

{The final answer is: Maggie should set her oven at 545 degrees for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.}</s>","The oven off by 18 degrees because 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18

Therefore X + .04X = 520
Therefore 1.04X = 520
The temperature to set it is 500 because 520 / 1.04 = <<520/1.04=500>>500

- Pete has 90 single contact boxes.
- Each box lasts 45 days.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of one contact box at the original price.
- Each contact box costs $100.00.

Step 3: Determine the discounted cost of one contact box.
- There is a 10% discount.
- Discount amount = $100.00 * 0.10 = $<<100*0.1=100.00>>100.00
- Discounted cost = $100.00 - $100.00 = $<<100-100=0.00>>0.00 (This question is incorrect as it results in a negative cost)
- In reality, the contact box costs $90.00 with the discount.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of buying 2 boxes of contacts (before discount).
- Each box costs $100.00.
- The cost of 2 boxes = 2 * $100.00 = $<<2*100=200.00>>200.00

Step 5: Determine the discounted cost of buying 2 boxes of contacts.

                    question:
                    Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. How many ml ? of water does she need to drink?
                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many calories Hannah burns during each activity and in total.

During 2 hours of aerobics, she burns: 500 calories/hour × 2 hours = 1000 calories
During 1 hour of running, she burns: 600 calories/hour × 1 hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned: 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, to find out how many milliliters of water she needs to drink, we can use the following calculation:

Total water needed = Total calories burned × Water needed per calorie
Total water needed = 1600 calories × 100 ml/400 calories

To find the number of calories in one milliliter of water, we divide 1 by 100 to get 1 calorie per 100 ml, and then divide this by 4 since we know that 1 calorie is equivalent to approximately 4 joules (the energy in food is often measured in kilojoules, which is equivalent to 1000 joules, making 1 calorie equal to 1 kcal, and 1 kcal is equivalent to 400 calories).

Total water needed = 1600 calories × 100 ml/400 calories = 1600 ml ÷ 4

However, the calculation should ideally result in a multiple of 100 ml, as the problem states that Hannah requires 100 ml of water for every 200 calories. To ensure this, we will take the above quotient and round it up to the nearest hundredth.

Total water needed ≈ 1600 ml ÷ 4 ≈ 400 ml → 500 ml

So, {The final answer is: Hannah needs to drink approximately 500 ml of water.}</s>","First find the total calories burned on aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = <<2*500=1000>>1000 calories
Then add the calories burned running to find the total calories burned: 600 calories + 1000 calories = <<600+1000=1600>>1600 calories
Finally, divide that number by the ratio of calories burned to water drunk to find how many water Hannah needs to drink: 1600 calories * 100 ml/200 calories = <<1600*100/200=800>>800 ml

                 [/INST] Let's Denote the number of red jelly beans as R, blue jelly beans as B, and green jelly beans as G. According to the problem, we have the following conditions:

1. R = B - 1% * B
2. G = B + 1% * B
3. R + B + G = 4500

Let's first find the number of blue jelly beans (B) by using some algebra:

1. From condition 2, we have R = B - 1% * B.
2. From condition 3, we have R + B + G = 4500.
3. Since we want to find the difference between green and red jelly beans, we can rewrite condition 3 as G = R + 2B + 4.5%.

Let's solve the system of equations:

1. Subtracting the first equation from the third, we have G = 3B + 4.5%.
2. Since conditions apply for jelly beans, G must be an integer. So, setting G = 3n and B = m, we can find some values that satisfy the condition:
3. 3B + 4.5% = 3m + 3n
4. 4.5% = n
5. n = 0.045*N
6. B = m = Round(M = 4500/(1+3*0.045))

After some trial and error, let's try M = 1250 first:

M = 1250
B = Round(M/1.1355) = 1103.5
Since B is not an integer, let's try the next integer value of M:
M = 1260
B = 1113

Now we have enough values for B and can find R and G:

R = B - 1% * B = 1113 - 1% * 1113 = 1111
G = 3B + 4.5% = 3*1113 + 4.5% = 3338.5

Since G is not an integer, the system of equations does not have a unique solution for our problem.

So, it is not possible to determine the exact number of jelly beans based on the given information.

After some ? lessons the next time he tests his typing speed it has increased , to 52 WPM. If . he continues to increase . his typing speed once more : by 5 . words, what . will be the average of the three measurements?
                 [/INST] To find the average of the three measurements, we first need to calculate the typing speed after the third increase. We know that Jared's typing speed increased by 5 words per minute each time.

Typing speed after second increase = Initial typing speed + Increase in typing speed
Typing speed after second increase = 47 WPM + 5 WPM = 52 WPM

Now we need to find Jared's typing speed after the third increase. We know that it increased by 5 words per minute each time.

Typing speed after third increase = Typing speed after second increase + Increase in typing speed
Typing speed after third increase = 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Finally, we can calculate the average of the three measurements:

Average typing speed = (Typing speed first + Typing speed second + Typing speed third) / Number of measurements
Average typing speed = (47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM) / 3

Calculating the sum of the typing speeds: 47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM = 156 WPM

Now, we can find the average typing speed by dividing the sum of the typing speeds by the number of measurements:

Average typing speed = 156 WPM / 3 = 52 WPM

However, we made a mistake in our calculation. The average of three numbers, X, Y, and Z, is calculated as (X + Y + Z) / 3. But, in this problem, we were given Jared's initial typing speed, and we calculated the typing speeds after the first and the second increases. Since we already have Jared's typing speed after the second increase (52 WPM), we should calculate the typing speed after the third increase directly from it, instead of using the initial typing speed as one of the measurements.

Therefore, the correct calculation should be as follows:

Typing speed after third increase = Typing speed after second increase + Increase in typing speed
Typing speed after third increase = 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Average typing speed = (Typing speed first + Typing speed second + Typing speed third) / Number of measurements
Average typing speed = (47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM) / 3

Calculating the sum of the typing speeds: 47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM = 156 WPM

Now, we should recalculate the average typing speed:

Average typing speed = 156 WPM / 3 = 52 WPM

But this result is still wrong. We made an error in the calculation of the average by using the initial typing speed in our calculation instead of the third measurement.

The final answer is: {Jared's average typing speed after three increases is 57 WPM, not 52 WPM. There was an error in the calculation provided above.}</s>","Jared types at 52 WPM and increases it by 5 WPM, 52 + 5 = <<52+5=57>>57 WPM.

His total is 156 / 3 typing speeds = <<156/3=52>>52 WPM as Jared's average typing speed.

2. Martin eats donuts: He gains 1.75 pounds/week.

Now, let's calculate the weight change after 5 weeks for each breakfast option:

1. Cheerios: 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds
2. Donuts: 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Finally, we find the difference in Martin's weight after 5 weeks:

The difference in Martin's weight = Weight with donuts - Weight with Cheerios

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total cost of buying boots on Amazon.
The cost of boots on Amazon is $16. The shipping cost is $4, so the total cost is:
$16 (cost of boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of buying boots on eBay.
The cost of boots on eBay is $13. The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon, so the shipping cost is:
$4 (shipping cost on Amazon) * 2 = $8
The total cost is:
$13 (cost of boots on eBay) + $8 (shipping on eBay)

Step 3: Compare the total costs and find the difference.
Comparing the total costs on both sites:
$20 (total cost on Amazon) vs $13 + $8 (total cost on eBay)

                 [/INST] Step 1: The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall.
Step 2: The beanstalk doubles its height every day.
Step 3: Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground.

The goal is to find out how many days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

Step 4: To be taller than Mark's window, the beanstalk must be 20 feet + the height it currently is. Since it doubles in height every day, we can set up the equation: 4 * 2^n = 20 + 4

Step 5: Solving the equation: 4 * 2^n = 24, where n is the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

Step 6: Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides: n = log2(1 + (20/4))

Step 7: Simplifying: n = log2(5)

Step 8: Using a calculator, log2(5) ≈ 3.17. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we must round up to the nearest whole number:

Step 9: n = 4 (This is incorrect because it results in the beanstalk being exactly as tall as the window, not taller. Let's try again.)

Step 10: Logarithms for bases other than 10 can be calculated using a calculator with the ""log"" function (use log(base 2) and input 5). This gives us an exact value: log2(5) = 3.169965825. Rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get n = 4. But since rounding up resulted in the beanstalk being exactly as tall as the window, we must add 1 day to get it to be taller.

Step 11: n = 5

The final answer is: {It takes 5 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window}.</s>","To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet
To find its height after two days, multiply the height after one day by 2: 8 feet * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 feet
To find its height after three days, multiply the height after two days by 2: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. This is taller than the window, so it took three days for the beanstalk to pass the window.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the protein content in 100 grams of mushrooms.
The protein content in 100 grams of mushrooms is ! 3 ? grams. So, the protein content in 1 gram of mushrooms is:

1 gram protein = ! 3 ? grams protein/100 grams
Protein content per gram = (1/100) * (! 3 ?) = (1/100) * 3g - 3/100 = 0.03g

Step 2: Find the protein John gets from eating 200 grams of mushrooms in a day.
Protein per day = Protein content per gram * Weight of mushrooms eaten
Protein per day = 0.03g/gram * 200 grams = 6g

Step 3: Find the protein John gets from eating mushrooms every week.
There are 7 days in a week. So,

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

1. We know that Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Let's represent his current age as C and his age 5 years ago as A. So, C = 2A.
2. We want to find Jerry's age in 3 years. Let's represent his age at that time as F.
3. We know that in 3 years, Jerry's age will be 3 years older than his age in the present. So, F = C + 3.
4. Since C = 2A, we can substitute this expression into the equation for F to find F in terms of A: F = 2A + 3.
5. We don't have a specific value for A, so we can't find an exact numerical value for F. However, we can express F in terms of A.

Therefore, {The final answer is: Jerry will be 2A + 3 years old in 3 years, where A represents his age 5 years ago.}</s>","We know that Jerry's Age/2 = Jerry's Age - 5
Therefore Jerry's Age = 2 Jerry's age - 10

How many hours does ; he need to work before he has enough to , pay for the dental work?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the dental work for both implants and the porcelain crown.
Each implant costs $2000, so the total cost for both is $2000 * 2 = $4000.
The porcelain crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4050.

Step 2: Determine how much George has paid as a deposit.
George has already paid a deposit of $600. So, we need to find out how much more he needs to pay.

Step 3: Subtract the deposit from the total cost of the dental work.
$4050 (total cost) - $600 (deposit) = $3450 (amount still owing)

Step 4: Calculate how many hours George needs to work to earn the remaining amount.
To earn $3450, George needs to work for a number of hours equal to $3450 / $15/hour = 229.66 hours.

Since George cannot work for a fraction of an hour, he needs to work for at least 230 hours to pay for the dental work.

{The final answer is: George needs to work for at least 230 hours to pay for the dental work.}</s>","The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the measure of the smallest angle as x. According to the problem, the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so:

x + 2x + 3x = 180
6x = 180
x = 30

So, the smallest angle in the triangle measures 30 degrees.

Now we can find the other two angles:

The angle that is twice the smallest angle measures 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.
The angle that is three times the smallest angle measures 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

Therefore, we have angles measuring 30, 60, and 90 degrees in the triangle, which forms a right-angled triangle. The sum of the measures of the two acute angles in a right-angled triangle is always less than the measure of the right angle. Since 60 + 90 = 150 > 90, it's guaranteed that the given angles form a right triangle.

The largest angle in this triangle is the right angle, which measures 90 degrees.

To find the total value in cents, we multiply the number of nickels and pennies by their respective values:
14 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $0.70
15 pennies * $0.01/penny = $0.15
Total amount in cents = $0.70 + $0.15 = $0.85

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the amount of money Howard spent on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Howard spent $8 on Monday. On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as that, so:
Tuesday spending = 2 * Monday spending
Tuesday spending = 2 * $8
Tuesday spending = $16

On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, so:
Wednesday spending = 4 * Tuesday spending
Wednesday spending = 4 * $16
Wednesday spending = $64

Step 2: Find the total amount of money Howard spent on these 3 days.

Total spending = Monday spending + Tuesday spending + Wednesday spending
Total spending = $8 + $16 + $64
Total spending = $88

Step 3: Determine the amount of money Howard had left after these purchases.

Initially, Howard had $100. After spending $88, he has:

Money left = Initial money - Total spending
Money left = $100 - $88
Money left = $12

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Patrick earned during the first 4 hours.
Amount sold during the first 4 hours = 15 cups per hour * 4 hours
Amount sold during the first 4 hours = 60 cups
Money earned during the first 4 hours = Amount sold * Price per cup
Money earned during the first 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup
Money earned during the first 4 hours = $30

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Patrick earned during the next 2 hours.
Amount sold during the last 2 hours = 10 cups per hour * 2 hours
Amount sold during the last 2 hours = 20 cups
Money earned during the last 2 hours = Amount sold * Price per cup
Money earned during the last 2 hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup
Money earned during the last 2 hours = $12

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Patrick earned during the entire 6 hours.
Total money earned = Money earned during the first 4 hours + Money earned during the last 2 hours
Total money earned = $30 + $12
Total money earned = $42

{The final answer is: Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.}</s>","Patrick earned $0.50 x 15 = $<<0.5*15=7.50>>7.50 from selling the lemonade for $0.50 per cup.

                    Every 2 miles a car drives the : tires rotate 725 times.  Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.  If each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations how ? many years before ? the tire needs to be replaced?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many rotations Jeremy's tires make in a month.
Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. So, for every mile driven, the tires rotate 362.5 times (half of 725). We know that Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so:
Number of rotations = Miles driven per month * Rotations per mile
Number of rotations = 400 miles * 362.5 rotations/mile
Number of rotations = 145,000 rotations/month

Step 2: Determine how many years the tires can last based on their total rotation capacity.
The tires can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before needing to be replaced. To find out how many years this equates to, we need to find out how many rotations are made in a year. We know that there are approximately 52 weeks (or 365.25 days) in a year, and that there are 24 hours in a day, so:
Number of miles driven in a year = Monthly miles driven * 12 months
Number of miles driven in a year = 400 miles/month * 12 months
Number of miles driven in a year = 4800 miles/year
Since the tires rotate 362.5 times for every mile driven, we can calculate the total number of rotations in a year as follows:
Total annual rotations = Miles driven in a year * Rotations per mile
Total annual rotations = 4800 miles/year * 362.5 rotations/mile
Total annual rotations = 1,749,700 rotations/year
To find out how many years the tires can last, we divide the total rotation capacity by the annual rotations:
Years until replacement = Total rotation capacity / Annual rotations
Years until replacement = 10,440,000 rotations / 1,749,700 rotations/year
Years until replacement ≈ 6 years
{The final answer is approximately 6 years.}

Therefore, based on the information provided, the tires should be replaced roughly every 6 years.</s>","Jeremy drives 400/2=<<400/2=200>>200 segments of 2 miles
That means each month the car undergoes 200*725=<<200*725=145000>>145,000 rotations
So the tire can last for 10,440,000/145,000=<<10440000/145000=72>>72 months
That means the tires will last 72/12=<<72/12=6>>6 years

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the price of the shirt after the sale.
Sale price of shirt = Original price * (1 - Sales tax percentage)
Sale price of shirt = $25 * (1 - 0.3)
Sale price of shirt = $25 * 0.7
Sale price of shirt = $17.50

Step 2: Calculate the price of the shorts after sales tax is included. (implication here is that sales tax is included in the given price)

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the outfit before tax:
Total cost before tax = Sale price of shirt + Price of shorts
Total cost before tax = $17.50 + $35
Total cost before tax = $52.50

Step 4: Since sales tax is not included in the problem, we don't need to calculate the amount of sales tax.

Step 5: The final calculation will be to find the amount of money left after the purchase, which is given as $50.

Step 6: Compare the total cost before tax ($52.50) with the amount of money Joe has ($50).

Since $52.50 > $50, it appears there is not enough money for the purchase with the given amounts. The problem statement may contain an error, as Joe does not seem to have enough money for the purchase with the given information.

Therefore, based on the provided information, there is not enough money for Joe to buy the shirt and shorts with the given amounts, and the final answer is not applicable.

However, if we assume there is a mistake in the given problem and Joe has $52.50, then the final answer would be:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many pounds of butter are needed to make 4 dozen croissants.
12 croissants = 1 dozen
1 dozen = 1/12 (since there are 12 in a dozen)

1. For the first 5 months, John had $100,000 in funding.

2. The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5-month period. So, it lasted for 5 * 10 = <<5*10=50>>50 months in total.

3. Every month after the first 5 took 50% more funding. Therefore, the cost for each month after the first 5 can be represented as 1.5 * original monthly cost. Since the original monthly cost was $100,000/5 = $<<100000/5=20000>>20,000. Thus, the cost for each month after the first 5 is 1.5 * $20,000 = $<<1.5*20000=30000>>30,000.

4. In the first 5 months, the cost was $100,000. For the remaining 45 months (50 total - 5 initial), the cost was $30,000 per month. So, the total research cost is:

   $100,000 (initial investment) + $30,000/month (remaining 45 monthly payments) * 45 months

5. Calculate the total cost:

   $100,000 + $30,000/month * 45 months

6. Final answer:

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the total amount Scarlett spent step by step:

1. Scarlett bought an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.
   { Spent on aquarium = $10.00 }

2. At the pet store, she bought 2 bags of rocks, with each bag costing $2.50:
   Cost of rocks = Number of bags * Price per bag
   Cost of rocks = 2 * $2.50
   { Spent on rocks = $5.00 }

3. She bought 3 pieces of coral, each costing $2.00:
   Cost of coral = Number of pieces * Price per piece
   Cost of coral = 3 * $2.00
   { Spent on coral = $6.00 }

4. She bought 20 fish, each costing $0.50:
   Cost of fish = Number of fish * Price per fish
   Cost of fish = 20 * $0.50
   { Spent on fish = $10.00 }

5. She needed to buy fish food that cost $2.00:
   { Spent on fish food = $2.00 }

Finally, let's add up these costs to find the total amount Scarlett spent:

{Total amount spent = Spent on aquarium + Spent on rocks + Spent on coral + Spent on fish + Spent on fish food}
{Total amount spent = $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00}
{Total amount spent = $33.00}

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00 on her aquarium setup and supplies.</s>","a bag of rocks cost $2.50 and she bought 2 bags so 2*2.50 = $<<2*2.5=5.00>>5.00

Step 1: In the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

Step 2: In the second week, it doubled in height. Given that it was 3 inches tall after the first week, it means that it became 3 inches x 2 = 6 inches tall in the second week.

Step 3: In the third week, it grew an additional 4 inches. Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is the initial height after the second week plus the growth during the third week: 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches.

1. Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. So, he sells:
   Meat per day = Meat per hour × Hours per day
               = 15kg × 10 hours
               = 150kg

2. Now, we have to find out how many days it takes for Prince to sell all the meat from Bill's bull. The bull weighs 750kg. So, we divide the weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in one day:
   Days needed = Weight of the bull / Meat per day
              = 750kg / 150kg

Now, let's calculate the days needed:

3.  days needed = 5

Step 2: Determine the total number of hours John spent at physical therapy during the 6-week period.
Total hours = Hours per week * Number of weeks
Total hours = 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of physical therapy.
The cost of one hour of physical therapy is $125. So the total cost for the 24 hours of therapy is:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces Jim chews at school.
- He chews 1 piece every 2 hours.
- School lasts for 8 hours.
- So, during school hours, he chews: 8 hours * (1 piece / 2 hours) = 4 pieces/hour * 8 hours = 32 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces Jim chews on the way home from school and after dinner.
- He chews 1 piece on the way home.
- Therefore, he chews an additional: 1 piece

- He chews 1 stick after dinner, which is equivalent to 3 pieces of gum (assuming a stick has 3 pieces).
- So, additional pieces chewed: 3 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the number of pieces Jim gives to his sister.
- He gives half of his remaining gum to his sister.

Step 4: Calculate the number of pieces Jim has before giving any to his sister.
- Jim starts with 20 pieces.
- He chews 32 pieces at school and on the way home.
- He chews 3 additional pieces after dinner.
- So, the number of pieces Jim has before giving any to his sister is: 20 + 32 + 3 = 55 pieces

Step 5: Calculate the number of pieces Jim gives to his sister.
- He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister.

Step 6: Calculate the number of pieces Jim has left at the end of the day.
- The number of pieces Jim gives to his sister is half of the pieces he has before giving any away.
  - Jim gives: 55 pieces/2 = 27.5 pieces
- Since Jim can't have a half piece, we'll assume he gives away a full pack of 10 pieces. This leaves him with: 55 pieces - 10 pieces = 45 pieces
- However, Jim chews 3 pieces that day, so he ultimately has: 45 pieces - 3 pieces = 42 pieces left at the end of the day.

{The final answer is}: Jim has 42 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.</s>","Jim goes to school for 8 hours, so if he chews 1 stick of gum every 2 hours that means he chews 8/2= <<8/2=4>>4 sticks of gum
Jim chews 1 stick on the way home, plus 2 sticks after dinner for a total of 1+1=2 sticks of gum
His sister asks for half his remaining gum. Jim started with 20 and has chewed 6, so he has 20-6=<<20-6=14>>14 sticks left
This means Jim gives her 14/2=<<14/2=7>>7 sticks of gum
Jim had 20 sticks of gum to begin with, and gave away 4+2+7=13 sticks away
This means Jim has 20-13= <<20-13=7>>7 sticks of gum remaining.

Charmaine's age now is given as 0. In 12 years, she will be a certain age (to be found). Additionally, we are asked to find her age 4 years from the present, which is 8 years after she turns 16.

Step 2: Find Charmaine's age in 12 years
To find Charmaine's age in 12 years, we add 12 to her current age. Since her current age is 0, we have:

Charmaine's age in 12 years = 0 + 12 = 12

So, Charmaine will be 12 years old in 12 years.

Step 3: Find Charmaine's age 4 years from now (or 8 years after she turns 16)
We know Charmaine will be 12 years old in 12 years, so in 8 years she will be 4 years older:

Charmaine's age 4 years from now = 12 + 4 = 16

                 [/INST] Sure! Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. We know that Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb per second.
2. We also know that 1 Mb has 1000 kb, so we need to convert Ashley's connection speed from kb per second to Mb per second and then to Mb per hour.
3. To convert kb to Mb, we divide by 1024 (since 1 kb = 1024 bytes and 1 Mb = 1,000,000 bytes): 20 kb/s = 20 x 1024/1024 Mb/s = 20 Mb/s
4. To convert Mb/s to Mb/hour, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute) and then by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 20 Mb/s x 60 minutes/hour x 60 seconds/minute = 72,000 Mb/hour
5. However, since it is not possible to have a data transfer rate of 72,000 Megabytes per hour, we must correct our calculation by dividing by 1024 to get the correct number of bytes in a Megabyte, and then dividing the result by 1024 again to get the correct number of Megabytes: 72,000,000,000 bytes/hour / 1024 Mb/Gb / 1024 Gb/Tb = 65.498 Tb/hour / 1024 Tb/Pb = 63.480732 Petabytes/hour

{The final answer is approximately 63.48 Petabytes per hour.}

Note: This calculation assumes that the internet connection speed is constant and does not take into account any potential data loss or network inefficiencies. In reality, internet connection speeds can vary, and actual data transfer rates may be lower than the advertised speeds.</s>","With a speed of 20 kb per second, there are 20*60 = <<20*60=1200>>1200 kb per minute.
As 1Mb has 1000kb, the converted speed is 1200/1000=<<1200/1000=1.2>>1.2Mb per minute.
So, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 1.2*60 = <<1.2*60=72>>72Mb per hour.

                    ? On a particular week, a tow truck pulled ten cars for each of the first three days ! and then four fewer cars on each of the remaining days of the week. Calculate , the total number of cars it towed that week.
                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that the tow truck towed ten cars on each of the first three days. So, the number of cars towed on the first three days is 3 * 10 = <<3*10=30>>30.

Step 2: For each of the remaining four days, the tow truck towed four fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Therefore, the number of cars towed on each of these days is 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6.

Step 3: To find the total number of cars towed on the four remaining days, we can multiply the number of cars towed on one day by the number of days. So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is 4 * 6 = <<4*6=24>>24.

Step 4: To find the total number of cars towed that week, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining days. So, the total number of cars towed that week is 30 + 24 = <<30+24=54>>54.

The final answer is: The tow truck towed a total of 54 cars that week.</s>","On the first three days, towing ten cars a day, the tow truck pulled 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 cars.
It pulled four fewer cars each day, which is 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 cars on the remaining days.
If it pulled ten cars for three days and four less on the remaining days, then it pulled for 7-3 = 4 days, four cars less each day.
For the four days, the car pulled 6*4= <<6*4=24>>24 cars.
The total number of cars it pulled that week is 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 cars.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Convert Adam's height and the minimum height requirement to feet.
Adam's height: 40 inches = 40 / 12 inches per foot = 3.33 feet
Minimum height requirement: 4 feet = 48 inches / 12 inches per foot = 4 feet = 4 feet

Step 2: Find out how much longer Adam needs to grow to meet the height requirement.
Height difference = Minimum height requirement - Adam's height
Height difference = 4 feet - 3.33 feet
Height difference = 0.67 feet = 0.67 x 12 inches per foot = 8 inches

Step 3: Determine how long it takes for Adam to grow the required amount.
Since Adam grows 2 inches a year, we divide the required growth by his yearly growth.
Time to grow = Required growth / Yearly growth
Time to grow = 8 inches / 2 inches per year
Time to grow = 4 years

The final answer is: Adam needs to wait 4 more years until he is tall enough to ride the biggest roller coaster at the amusement park.</s>","Adam needs to grow 8 inches because 48 -40= <<48-40=8>>8

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. First, let's find out how much James spent on buying the 10 cars. Since each car cost $25,000, this means that:
   Cost of 10 cars = 10 * $25,000 = $250,000

2. Next, we need to determine how much the company paid James for those cars. They paid him 30% of the car prices, so:
   Payment for cars = 30% of $250,000 = $250,000 * 0.3 = $75,000

3. Now let's calculate the profit James made on each car by subtracting the cost from the selling price:
   Profit per car = $25,000 (his selling price) - $10,000 (what he paid for it) = $15,000

4. James gets a 10% commission on the profit from each car sale. To find out how much commission he made from one car, multiply the profit by 10%:
   Commission per car = $15,000 * 0.1 = $1,500

5. Since James sold 10 cars, we can find out how much commission he made in total by multiplying the commission per car to the number of cars sold:
   Total commission = $1,500 * 10 = $15,000

6. To find out the total amount James made from his sales (profit + commission), add the profit and commission:
   Total amount made = $15,000 (profit) + $15,000 (commission) = $30,000

{The final answer is: James made a total of $30,000 from selling used cars.}</s>","He sold the car for 25000*10=$<<25000*10=250000>>250,000

So they bought the cars for 7500*10=$<<7500*10=75000>>75,000
That means the cars had a profit of 250,000-75,000=$<<250000-75000=175000>>175,000

                 [/INST] Let's denote the price of a diamond jewel as D. Then the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 * D, and the price of a silver jewel is D - $400.

We want to find the total price of all three jewels, so we need to calculate the price of each jewel and then add them up.

Price of a diamond jewel: D
Price of a gold jewel: 4/5 * D
Price of a silver jewel: D - $400

Now we can find the total price:

Total price = Price of a diamond jewel + Price of a gold jewel + Price of a silver jewel

Total price = D + (4/5)D + (D - $400)

To solve for the total price, we first need to simplify the expression:

Total price = D + 4/5D + D - $400

Combine the terms with D:

Total price = 5D/5 + D - $400

Convert every term back to D:

Total price = (5D + D) / 5 - $400

Total price = (6D) / 5 - $400

Now we have the expression for the total price, but we need to find the numerical value for D. Since the price of a diamond jewel is given as $2000, we can calculate D and then find the total price using the expression we derived.

Price of a diamond jewel: D = $2000

Now we can find the total price:

Total price = (6 * $2000) / 5 - $400

Total price = $12,000 - $400

Total price = $11,600

{The final answer is: $11,600}</s>","If a diamond Jewellcosts $2000, the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5*$2000 = $1600

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of rose stamps as R, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of snowflake stamps as S.

We know the following facts from the problem:

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So the number of truck stamps is T = S + 3.
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So the number of rose stamps is R = T - 9.

Our goal is to find the total number of stamps Max bought. This is given by the sum of the number of snowflake stamps, rose stamps, and truck stamps:

Total number of stamps = S + R + T

Substitute the expressions we have for R and T in terms of S into the equation:

Total number of stamps = S + (S+3)-9 + (S+3)

Combine terms:

Total number of stamps = 3S +3 + S + 3 - 9

Simplify:

Total number of stamps = 3S +3 + S - 6

Combine like terms:

Total number of stamps = 4S - 3.

So, the final answer is: {Max bought 4S - 3 stamps in all}.

Note: To find an actual number of stamps Max bought, we need to know the value of S (the number of snowflake stamps). We don't have enough information from the problem to determine the value of S.</s>","Max bought 16 + 3 = <<16+3=19>>19 truck stamps.

                    Bob is . 75 miles ahead of Tom, driving 55 miles per hour. Tom is driving 70 miles per hour. How long will it take Tom to catch up with Bob?
                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes Tom to catch up with Bob, we first need to find out the distance between them that Tom needs to cover to catch up. We know that Bob is 0.75 miles ahead of Tom, and they are traveling in the same direction. Thus, the total distance between them is the sum of the distance travelled by Bob and the distance Tom still needs to cover to catch up.

Let's call the time it takes Tom to catch up t (in hours). We know that Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour, and Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour. The total distance between them is currently 0.75 miles.

From the problem statement, we have two equations:

Tom's distance travelled in time t = 70t
Bob's distance travelled in time t = 55t

Since Tom is trying to catch up with Bob, we know that Tom's distance must be greater than or equal to Bob's distance. Mathematically, we can write this as:

70t >= 55t + 0.75

We can simplify this inequality by subtracting 55t from both sides:

15t >= 0.75

Now, we can divide both sides by 15 to find the time it takes Tom to catch up:

t >= 0.05 hours

However, this result may not make much sense, as it indicates that Tom will never be able to catch up with Bob (t > 0 hours). This implies that there is an error or inconsistency in the given information. We cannot determine the answer with the given data.

The final answer is: There is no definitive answer due to inconsistent or insufficient information.

We would need more information or an error correction to find the answer to this question. For example, the initial distances of both Bob and Tom could be different, which would result in different speeds relative to each other and potentially allow Tom to catch up to Bob.</s>","Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour to Bob's 55 miles per hour, meaning Tom is gaining at a rate of 70 mph - 55 mph = <<70-55=15>>15 mph.
Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, and if Tom is gaining 15 mph on him, it will take Tom 75 miles / 15 mph = <<75/15=5>>5 hours to catch up with Bob.

                 [/INST] To find out how many classes Manny can miss and still have his parents sign him up for Karate classes again, we need to determine the cost of the classes he attends and the cost of the classes he misses.

Let's denote the cost of one class as C. We know that the cost for 10 classes that Manny attends is $60. So, we have:

10C = $60
C = $6 per class

Since the parents have told Manny that they won't sign him up again if the classes cost more than $1 per class, we can calculate how many classes Manny can miss without exceeding the $10 limit on additional costs:

Cost of classes Manny attends = 10 * C = 10 * $6 = $60
Cost of classes Manny misses = number of missed classes * $1

To find the number of missed classes, we need to make sure the total cost of classes Manny attends plus the classes he misses does not exceed $60. Therefore,

$60 (total cost attended) + number of missed classes * $1 (cost of one missed class) <= $60

Solving for the number of missed classes:

number of missed classes <= $60 - $0 (cost of attending) = $60

Since Manny cannot miss more than the total number of classes (10 classes), we have to find the maximum number of classes he can miss while still being signed up again. This means that the number of missed classes has to be less than 10:

number of missed classes = 10 - number of classes attended
number of missed classes <= 10 - 10
number of missed classes <= 0

Since a negative number of missed classes does not make sense, we can determine that Manny cannot miss any classes and still be signed up for classes again. If he misses even one class, the total cost would exceed $10 per class, and his parents would not sign him up for the next classes.

Therefore, the final answer is: Manny cannot miss any classes if he wants his parents to sign him up for Karate classes again.</s>","He must attend at least six classes, because 60 / 6 = <<60/6=10>>10

1. Julie processes customers twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily:
   Customers Julie processes daily = 2 * Customers Jewel processes daily
   = 2 * 50
   = 100 customers

2. To find their combined weekly production, we need to multiply their daily production by the number of days in a week (7):
   Weekly production for Julie = Daily production * Days per week
   = 100 customers * 7
   = 700 customers

   Weekly production for Jewel = 50 customers * 7
   = 350 customers

3. To find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel, we add their individual weekly productions:
   Total weekly production = Weekly production for Julie + Weekly production for Jewel

2. Price of one orange = $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples:

Cost of 5 apples = 5 × Price of one apple = 5 × $1.30 = $6.50

Similarly, we can find the cost of 5 oranges:

Cost of 5 oranges = 5 × Price of one orange = 5 × $1.10 = $5.50

                    question:
                    Bob wants to dig a : hole 6 , feet long . by 4 feet wide ; by 3 feet deep. If it ? takes him 3 seconds to ; shovel a cubic foot of earth, ! how long will ! it take him to dig . the hole?
                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes Bob to dig the hole, we first need to find the volume of the hole and then calculate how long it will take him to shovel that volume of earth.

Step 1: Find the volume of the hole.
The volume of a rectangular prism (like our hole) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. In this case, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the height is 3 feet.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 ft * 4 ft * 3 ft
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Step 2: Calculate how long it will take Bob to shovel the earth from the hole.
We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to shovel the entire volume of the hole, we simply multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot.

Total time = Volume * Time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 cubic feet * 3 seconds/cubic foot
Total time = 216 seconds

{The final answer is 216 seconds or 3 minutes and 54 seconds.}</s>","The hole is 6 feet long by 4 feet wide by 3 feet deep or 6 * 4 * 3 = <<6*4*3=72>>72 cubic feet.
Bob shovels a cubic foot of earth every 3 seconds so it will take 72 * 3 = <<72*3=216>>216 seconds to dig the hole.

                 [/INST] To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to find the base price of the truck and add the costs of the optional features.

First, we have the base price of the truck, which is $30,000.

Next, we have the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is an extra $7,500.

The cost of the leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade. So, the cost of the leather seats is:

$7,500 × 1/3 = $2,500

The cost of the running boards is $500 less than the cost of the leather seats. So, the cost of the running boards is:

$2,500 - $500 = $2,000

Finally, there is the cost of the upgraded exterior light package, which is $1,500.

To find the total cost of the truck, we add the base price to the cost of the optional features:

Total cost = $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500

Total cost = $30,000 + $13,500

Total cost = $43,500

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate Tim's new monthly salary with the 5% raise.
New monthly salary = Old monthly salary + (Old monthly salary * Raise percentage)
New monthly salary = $20000 + ($20000 * 0.05)

Step 2: Simplify the calculation.
New monthly salary = $20000 + $1000
New monthly salary = $21000

Step 3: Calculate the bonus amount.
Bonus = Half of monthly salary
Bonus = $21000 * 0.5

Step 4: Calculate the bonus amount.
Bonus = $10500

Step 5: Calculate Tim's annual salary.
Annual salary = (New monthly salary + Bonus) * 12
Annual salary = ($21000 + $10500) * 12

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of suits.
Each suit costs $750, and James buys 10 suits, so:
Cost of suits = $750 * 10
Cost of suits = $7,500

Step 2: Calculate the cost of dress pants.
The dress pants cost 1/5 the cost of suits, so:
Cost of dress pants = (1/5) * $7,500
Cost of dress pants = $1,500

Step 3: Calculate the cost of dress shirts.
James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and there are 10 suits, so:
Number of dress shirts = 3 * 10 = 30
The cost of each dress shirt is $60, so:
Cost of dress shirts = $60 * 30
Cost of dress shirts = $1,800

Step 4: Determine the total cost.
The cost of suits = $7,500
The cost of dress pants = $1,500
The cost of dress shirts = $1,800

So, the total cost = $7,500 (suits) + $1,500 (dress pants) + $1,800 (dress shirts)
Total cost = $10,800

Step 1: Calculate the number of kilograms in one portion.
One portion = 2 kilograms

Step 2: Calculate the number of portions that make up the entire bag.
Total portions = Total weight of the flour in the bag / Weight of one portion
Total portions = (Total kilograms of flour) / 2

Alisa bikes at a speed of 12 miles per hour. To find out how far she bikes in 4.5 hours, we can use the formula:
distance = speed × time

So, for Alisa:
distance = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance Stanley biked in 2.5 hours.
Stanley bikes at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find out how far he bikes in 2.5 hours, we can use the same formula as before:

distance = speed × time

So, for Stanley:
distance = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Step 3: Find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley.
We can simply add the distances they each biked to find the total distance.

total distance = Alisa's distance + Stanley's distance

total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

1. Digging through soil: Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil. So, the time it takes him to dig through 24 feet of soil is:
   Time_soil = Amount_of_soil_to_dig / Digging_rate_soil
   Time_soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
   Time_soil = 6 hours

2. Digging through clay: Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil. So, the time it takes him to dig through 8 feet of clay is:
   Time_clay = Amount_of_clay_to_dig / Digging_rate_clay
   Time_clay = 8 feet / (1/2) hours/foot
   Time_clay = 16 hours

3. Finding the total time it takes Bill to dig the well: Since Bill has to dig through the soil and clay one after another, we add the time it takes to dig through each layer.

                    question:
                    Ariadne has a shop selling hats of two different colors, red ! and green. Her sales from red ? hats were $400 . in a particular month, half the total amount she earned from selling green : hats. , Calculate the total amount she made in two months : if in ! the second ; month her sales were ! 3/4 of the total sales of the , first month.
                 [/INST] Let's denote the sales from red hats in the first month as $R_1$ and the sales from green hats in the first month as $G_1$. We know that:

1. $R_1$ = $400$
2. $G_1$ = $\frac{1}{2}(Total\ Sales\_First\ Month)$

Since half of the total sales in the first month came from green hats, we can calculate the total sales in the first month:

$Total\ Sales\_First\ Month$ = $R_1$ + $G_1$

$Total\ Sales\_First\ Month$ = $400$ + $G_1$

Now, let's find out the sales from green hats in the second month. The question states that the sales in the second month were 3/4 of the total sales in the first month. So:

$G_2$ = 3/4 * $Total\ Sales\_First\ Month$

Substituting the expression for $Total\ Sales\_First\ Month$ from above:

$G_2$ = 3/4 * ($400$ + $G_1$)

To find the total sales in two months, we need to find the sales from both red and green hats in each month. Since we already have the sales from red hats in both months, we just need to find the sales from green hats in the second month.

We have shown above that:

$G_1$ = $\frac{1}{2}(Total\ Sales\_First\ Month)$

Substituting $R_1$ = $400$ into this equation, we get:

$G_1$ = $\frac{1}{2}(400$ + $G_1$)

We also know that $G_2$ = 3/4 * $Total\ Sales\_First\ Month$, so:

$G_2$ = 3/4 * ($400$ + $G_1$)

To solve this system of equations, we can use a few iterations. A more efficient approach would be to solve this equation algebraically or graphically. Unfortunately, this is beyond the scope of this response as it would require some form of matrix algebra or graphing software. Without loss of generality, let's assume a possible value for $G_1$, calculate the corresponding $G_2$, and double-check that it satisfies the given conditions.

Assuming $G_1$ = $200$, we can calculate $R_1$ as:

$R_1$ = $400$ - $G_1$ = $400$ - $200$ = $200$

Now, we can substitute $Total\ Sales\_First\ Month$ = $400$ + $200$ = $600$ into the equation for $G_2$:

$G_2$ = 3/4 * ($600$ + $G_1$) = $\frac{3}{4}(600$ + $200)$ = $\frac{3}{4}(800)$ = $1200$

So the possible sales from green hats in the second month are $1200$. To check that this satisfies the given condition ($G_2$ = 3/4 * $Total\ Sales\_First\ Month$), we can calculate the total sales in the second month:

$Total\ Sales\_Second\ Month$ = $R_2$ + $G_2$ = $200$ + $1200$ = $1220$

Since we know that $Total\ Sales\_First\ Month$ + $Total\ Sales\_Second\ Month$ = $2 * (400)$ = $800$, we can double-check that the sales in two months add up to the given total:

$800$ = $400$ + $Total\ Sales\_Second\ Month$ = $400$ + $1220$

Therefore, our assumption of $G_1$ = $200$ turns out to be a possible solution, and the total sales in two months are:
- Red hats: $200$ in the first month and $200$ in the second month
- Green hats: $200$ in the first month and $1200$ in","Since the total sales of red hats were half that of green hats in the first month, she made 2*$400=$<<2*400=800>>800 from green hats.
Her total sales in the first month are $800+$400=$<<800+400=1200>>1200.
In the second month, she made 3/4*1200=$<<3/4*1200=900>>900.
The total amount of money Ariadne made from two months of sales is $1200+$900=$<<1200+900=2100>>2100.

                 [/INST] To calculate how much James paid, we need to find out how many hours he paid for after the first hour, which was free.Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. We know that James was renting the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM. The total duration is 4 hours.
2. The first hour was free, so James actually paid for 3 hours.
3. The first paid hour cost $15.
4. Each hour after the first one costs twice the amount of the first hour.

Let x be the cost of one hour after the first hour.

We know that the cost of the first hour is $15, and each hour after that costs twice as much:

x = 2 * $15 = $30

Therefore, James paid for 3 hours at $15 for the first hour and $30 for each of the next 2 hours.

To find out the total cost, we simply calculate the sum:

Total cost = $15 + $30 * 2
Total cost = $15 + $60
Total cost = $75

{The final answer is: James paid $75 for the carriage rental.}</s>","He got it for 9-5=<<9-5=4>>4 hours
He pays for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours
The first hour cost 1*15=$<<1*15=15>>15

They cost 15*2=$<<15*2=30>>30 per hour
So those 2 hours cost 2*30=$<<2*30=60>>60
So he pays 60+15=$<<60+15=75>>75 per hours

Each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves

Step 3: Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed for all guests.
Total deviled egg halves = Number of guests * Deviled egg halves per guest
Total deviled egg halves = 16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves
Total deviled egg halves = 48 deviled egg halves

Step 4: Find out how many whole eggs are needed to make the required deviled egg halves.
1 whole egg = 2 deviled egg halves

Subtracting the number of pages Sheila has already written from the total number of pages in the paper, we get the number of pages she has left to write:

Pages left to write = Total pages in the paper - Pages already written

Cost of 1/2 pound of almonds = $10 * 1/2 = $5

Cost of walnuts = 1 pound -> $15
Cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts = $15 * 1/3 = $5\*\*1/3 ≈ $5.56 (rounded)

Cost of the mixture = $5 (for almonds) + $5.56 (for walnuts) = $10.56

Now, let's calculate the cost of 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts:

Cost of 1/5 pound of almonds = $10 * 1/5 = $2

Cost of walnuts = 1 pound -> $15
Cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts = $15 * 1/3 = $5

Cost of the second mixture = $2 (for almonds) + $5 (for walnuts) = $7

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. We are given two equations based on the information provided in the problem:

1. The total number of animal legs is 70. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we have:
   S * 4 + G * 2 = 70
   Simplifying this equation:
   S = (70 - 2G) / 4

2. The total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, we have:
   S + G = 20

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables (S and G). We can solve this system by substitution or elimination method. Let's use the substitution method. Solving the second equation for S, we get:

   S = 20 - G

Now we can substitute S = 20 - G in the first equation to get:

   (70 - 2G) / 4 = 20 - G

To solve for G, we can first find the value of G in terms of S from the second equation (G = 20 - S), then substitute it into the first equation and solve for G.

   (70 - 2(20 - S)) / 4 = 20 - (20 - S)

Simplifying this equation:

   70 - 40 + S / 4 = 20 + S
    30 + S / 4 = 20 + S

Now we can cancel out the common term S from both sides:

    30 / 4 > 0

Since 30 / 4 is not an integer, there is no valid solution for the number of sheep and geese on Lee's farm that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the problem has no answer. {The final answer is: No validanswer exists.}</s>","Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.
Therefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of a week's worth of coffee using the more expensive brand.
Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and there are 7 days in a week, he needs 7 pounds of coffee in a week.
He buys the more expensive brand, which costs 20% more than the normal brand, so the cost of 1 pound of this coffee is $5 * 1.2 = $6.
Therefore, a week's worth of coffee will cost 7 * $6 = $42.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of a donut.
The cost of a donut is $2.

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how much Gus spent on chips, fried chicken, and the soda:

1. Chips: Gus bought 2 bags, each costing $2.00. So, he spent $2.00 x 2 = $4.00 on chips.

2. Fried Chicken: Gus spent $8.00 on the bucket of fried chicken.

3. Soda: Gus spent $1.00 on the bottle of soda.

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent on these items:

Total spent on chips, chicken, and soda: $4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. So, to find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to subtract the amount spent on chips, chicken, soda from the total amount spent:

Cost of apple pie = Total spent - (Cost of chips + Cost of chicken + Cost of soda)
Cost of apple pie = $20.00 - ($4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00)

Simplify the above expression:

Cost of apple pie = $20.00 - ($13.00)

Subtract:

Cost of apple pie = $7.00

{The final answer is: The apple pie cost $7.00}</s>","He bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each so they cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00
He spent $4.00 on chips, $8.00 on fried chicken and $1.00 on soda so he spent 4+8+1 = $<<4+8+1=13.00>>13.00
He spent $20.00 and all of the groceries, except for the pie cost $13.00 so that means the apple pie cost 20-13 = $<<20-13=7.00>>7.00

                 [/INST] To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers he delivers to Districts A and C from the total number of newspapers he delivers in a day.

Total newspapers delivered = Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District B + Newspapers to District C

Given:
Newspapers to District A = 198
Newspapers to District C = 209

From the given information, we know that James delivers 600 newspapers in a day. So, we can find the number of newspapers he delivers to District B by subtracting the number of newspapers he delivers to Districts A and C from the total number of newspapers he delivers:

Newspapers to District B = Total newspapers - Newspapers to District A - Newspapers to District C

Plug in the values we have:

Newspapers to District B = 600 - 198 - 209

Each class session lasts for 2 hours, and there are 4 sessions per week. So, the number of hours John spends in class each week is 2 hours/session * 4 sessions/week = 8 hours/week.

The class lasts for 6 weeks, so the total number of hours John spends in class is 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

Step 2: Determine how many new recipes John learns per hour of class time.
The problem states that John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. So, he learns 1 recipe / (1.5 hours * 2 hours) = 1 recipe / 3 hours = 0.333... recipes/hour.

Step 3: Calculate how many recipes John learns in total.
To find out how many recipes John learns during the entire cooking class, multiply the number of hours he spends in class by the number of recipes he learns per hour: 48 hours * 0.333... recipes/hour = approximately 15.5 recipes.

Since John can't learn half a recipe, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, {The final answer is: John learns approximately 16 recipes in the cooking class.}</s>","He is in class for 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 hours per week

                 [/INST] Let's denote the amount of money that Kassidy has as K, and since Rayna has 60 dollars more than Kassidy, then Rayna's amount of money is K + $60.

We know that Kassidy's money is 3/4 of Aurelia's money, and Aurelia has $120, so we can write the equation:

K = (3/4) * $120

Solving this equation, we get:

K = $90

Now we have Kassidy's money, which is $90, and Rayna's money, which is $90 + $60 = $150.

The question asks for the amount of money each of them would have if they added their money together and shared it equally.

First, we calculate the total amount of money that they both have:

Total amount = Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
             = $90 + $150
             = $240

Since they decide to share the money equally, we divide the total amount by the number of people:

Amount per person = Total amount / Number of people
                 = $240 / 2
                 = $120

Therefore, after they share their money equally, each of them would have $120.

{The final answer is: Each of them would have $120 after sharing their money equally.}</s>","Since Arelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money Arelia, Kassidy has 3/4*$120 = $<<3/4*120=90>>90

Step 3: Compare the total cost of candies with the amount Adam paid.
Since Adam paid $15, we have $15 > $11. Therefore, Adam must have given change to the cashier.

Janey's number of books = 2 * Sally's number of books + 3

We're told that Janey has 21 books, so we can set up the equation:

2 * Sally's number of books + 3 = 21

To find Sally's number of books, we first need to solve for Sally's number of books in this equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides, then dividing by 2:

Sally's number of books = (21 - 3) / 2

Simplifying this expression:

Sally's number of books = 10.5

Since we can't have half a number of books, there must be an error in the problem statement. It's likely that the number of books Janey has (21) was meant to be the total number of books they both have, in which case Sally would have a number of books less than Janey's number by 3.

To find Sally's number of books in this situation, we can subtract 3 from Janey's number:

                 [/INST] To find the number of days it takes for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches from its current height of 20 feet, we first need to convert the current height to inches and then determine how many inches of growth are needed to reach 600 inches.

Step 1: Convert current height from feet to inches.
We know that 1 foot = 12 inches. So, the current height is:
Current height = 20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches.

Step 2: Determine the number of inches of growth needed.
Target height = 600 inches.
Current height = 240 inches.

Required growth = Target height - Current height
Required growth = 600 inches - 240 inches
Required growth = 360 inches

Step 3: Determine the number of days required for this amount of growth.
We know that the bamboo grows up to 30 inches a day. Thus, the number of days required for the required growth is:

Days required = Required growth / Growth per day
Days required = 360 inches / 30 inches/day
Days required = 12 days

{The final answer is: It will take 12 days for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.}.</s>","Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.
So, the bamboo needs to grow 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 inches more.
Therefore, it will take 360/30 = <<360/30=12>>12 days for its height to be 600 inches.

                 [/INST] First, let's determine how many toys James needs for the current number of dogs in the shelter. We know that he currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so we need to find out how many toys are needed for the remaining dogs.

Current number of dogs = 4 (that James has toys for) + 8 (newly arrived dogs) = 12 dogs

Toys needed for current dogs = Toys per dog

{Toys needed for current dogs = 12 toys}

Next, James went back to find that there were twice as many more dogs as when he left. Let's calculate how many more dogs there are and how many toys are needed for them.

Additional dogs = Number of dogs when James left * 2

Additional dogs = 12 dogs * 2 = 24 dogs

Toys needed for additional dogs = Toys per dog

{Toys needed for additional dogs = 24 toys}

Finally, 3 toys were no longer needed because 3 dogs were gone. Let's subtract these toys from the total amount needed.

Total toys needed = Toys needed for current dogs + Toys needed for additional dogs - Unneeded toys

Total toys needed = 12 toys + 24 toys - 3 toys = 39 toys

{The final answer is 39 toys}</s>","James has 4+8=<<4+8=12>>12 toys.

1. The total amount invested by the three people is $1200.
2. Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount. So, his investment is $1200 * (2/5) = $1200 * 0.4 = $480.
3. After Dylan's investment, there is a remaining amount for Frances and Skyler. This amount is the initial total amount minus Dylan's investment: $1200 - $480 = $720.
4. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. So, her investment is $720 * (2/3) = $720 * 0.666667 (approximately) = $475.
5. Since we know the investments of Dylan and Frances, we can find Skyler's investment by subtracting their investments from the total. Skyler's investment is $1200 - $480 (Dylan) - $475 (Frances) = $245.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how much Karen earns per hour. We know that Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, so:
Karen's hourly wage = 2 * Lorie's hourly wage
                 = 2 * $10/hour
                 = $20/hour

Step 2: Find out how much Karen earns in one day. We know she works 3 hours per day, so:
Daily earnings for Karen = Hourly wage * Hours worked
                       = $20/hour * 3 hours
                       = $60/day

Step 3: Find out how much Karen earns in two days. We know that two days consists of 2 * 24 hours = 48 hours, so:
Total earnings for Karen in 2 days = Daily earnings * Number of days
                            = $60/day * 2 days

                 [/INST] I see that there are some errors in the problem statement. Let's correct it step by step:

1. The problem says that 0.6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, but it should say that 1 potato makes x hash browns, and 0.6 potatoes make 36x hash browns.
2. The problem also asks for the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes.

Given that 1 potato makes x hash browns, let's find x:

1 potato = 36x hash browns
x = 36^(-1) = 0.028 hash browns per potato

Now, to find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes:

Number of hash browns = Number of potatoes * Hash browns per potato
= 96 potatoes * 0.028 hash browns/potato
= 2.688 hash browns

Since we cannot make a fraction of a hash brown, we need to round up to the next whole number:

{The final answer is 3 hash browns}

Note that this calculation assumes that the conversion rate from potatoes to hash browns (0.028 hash browns per potato) remains constant.</s>","First find the number of hash browns per potato: 36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = <<36/6=6>>6 hash browns/potato

                    The . elevator in Jack's building supports a maximum load of 700 kg. . An adult ! weighs ; an , average of 80 kg. If Jack rides the , elevator with 8 other adults, by how much will they have exceeded the maximum load of : the elevator?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.
Each adult weighs 80 kg. Jack weighs _ kg (let's assume Jack's weight is x kg).
So the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults is 80kg * 9 (Jack + 8 adults) + x kg

Step 2: Solve for x if we don't know Jack's weight.
If x is not given, we can set up an equation:
Total weight = 80kg * 9 + x
Total weight = 720kg + x

Step 3: Find the difference between the total weight and the maximum load.
If we know Jack's weight (x), we can subtract the maximum load from the total weight to find the excess weight.
The difference = Total weight - Maximum load
The difference = (720kg + x) - 700kg

Step 4: Determine the excess weight.
To find the excess weight, we need to subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
Excess weight = (720kg + x) - 700kg
Excess weight = 200kg + x - 700kg
Excess weight = (x - 480kg)

So the excess weight depends on Jack's weight (x). If Jack weighs less than or equal to 480kg, they won't exceed the maximum load of 700kg.

Therefore, there isn't a definitive answer for the final exceeded weight, as it depends on Jack's weight.

Final answer: {It's impossible to determine the exact excess weight based on the given problem, as it depends on Jack's weight.}</s>","Jack and 8 other adults form a total of 8 adults + 1 adult = <<8+1=9>>9 adults.
In total, the 9 adults together weigh 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = <<9*80=720>>720 kg.
They have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 720 kg - 700 kg = <<720-700=20>>20 kg.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

1. We know that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has:
   Max cookies = Katarina cookies + 5
   Max cookies = 68 + 5 = 73 cookies

2. We also know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster and Summer combined, so the total number of cookies for the Cookie Monster and Summer is:
   Cookies for Cookie Monster and Summer = Max cookies - 12
   Cookies for Cookie Monster and Summer = 73 - 12 = 61 cookies

3. To find the total number of cookies, we just need to add the number of cookies that Katarina has, Max has, and the Cookie Monster and Summer have together:
   Total cookies = Katarina cookies + Max cookies + Cookies for Cookie Monster and Summer
   Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 = 182 cookies

                 [/INST] Let's denote the original length of the dress as L (in centimeters). Shania extends the length of the dress by 50%, so the new length is 1.5 times the original length:

New length = 1.5 * Original length = 1.5L

We're given that the new length is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5L = 140

To find the original length, we need to isolate L:

L = 140 / 1.5
L = 93.333 cm

However, the problem mentions that Shania adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the original length of the dress (without the extension) must be smaller than 93.333 cm.

Since Shania extended the dress by 50%, let's assume the original length was 62.7 cm (half of the new length). Here's the reasoning behind this:

If the original length was L, then the new length would be 1.5L = 140. But if we subtract the 20 cm added to the bottom, we have 140 - 20 = 120 cm, which is 2.4 times the original length (since 120 = 2.4 * 50 = 2.4 * 62.7). Since we're looking for a value that is 1.5 times smaller than 140, the original length must be half of that value, i.e., 62.7 / 2 = 31.35 cm. However, this value doesn't seem to fit the equation 1.5L = 140.

To find the correct original length, let's adjust our assumption and assume the original length was 61.3 cm (slightly less than half of 140).

With an original length of 61.3 cm, we get a new length of 1.5 * 61.3 = 92.0 cm, which is 19.7 cm shorter than the given length of 111.7 cm. To reach the given length, we need to add an additional 11.7 cm to the original length.

Thus, the original length was: 61.3 + 11.7 = 73 cm

Therefore, the final answer is: {The original length of the dress was 73 cm}.</s>","Without the lace trim, the dress is 140cm full length – 20cm lace trim = <<140-20=120>>120cm.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the age of one of the twins as x, and the age of the other twin as x + 7 (since one twin is 7 years older). The ages of the three triplets can be denoted as y, y, and y.

We know that the sum of the ages of all six individuals is 44, so:

x + (x + 7) + 3y = 44

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 7 + 3y = 44

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 37

Dividing both sides by 2:

x + y = 18.5

Since the ages are in whole numbers, we need to find an integer value for x and y such that x + y = 19 (rounding up 18.5 to 19).

By trial and error, we find that x = 8 and y = 11 satisfies this condition.

Therefore, one of the twins is 8 years old. {The final answer is 8.}</s>","Let T = age of triplet

Total time spent on homework = 80 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the remaining time before dinner.
John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner.
Time in minutes = 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour
Time in minutes = 180 minutes

Step 3: Subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John can take a nap.
Minutes for a nap = Time before dinner - Time spent on homework

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the cost of the lollipops and candies Manolo already bought.
The cost of the five lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.
The cost of the four candies is 4 * ($unknown) (we don't know the cost of each candy yet, let's call it x).

The total cost of the lollipops and candies Manolo already bought is $2.00 + 4x = $3.20.

Step 2: Solve for x - the cost of each candy.
Subtract the known costs from the total cost:
$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

Divide this by the number of candies:
$1.20 / 4 = $0.30

So, each candy costs $0.30.

Step 3: Determine the cost of 10 lollipops.
Cost of 10 lollipops = 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.

Step 4: Determine the cost of 10 candies.
Cost of 10 candies = 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

Step 5: Determine the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies.
Total cost = $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

{The final answer is $7.00}.</s>","Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.
So four candies cost $3.20 - $2 = $1.20.

Ten lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.
Ten candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.
Hence, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4 + $3 = $7.

                 [/INST] To find out how many coins Neil and Rong have saved ten years after they started, we first need to determine how many coins each one saves per month, and then calculate how many coins they have saved in total over ten years.

1. Rong saves `20 coins` per month.
2. Neil saves `2/5 * 20 = 40 coins` per month since he saves `2/5` times more coins than Rong.

To calculate how many coins they have saved in total, we need to find out how many months have passed in ten years, and then multiply that by the number of coins saved per month for both Rong and Neil.

1. One year has `12` months.
2. Ten years have `10 * 12 = 120` months.

Now, we can calculate how many coins Rong and Neil have saved over ten years.

1. Rong has saved `20 coins/month * 120 months = 2400 coins`.
2. Neil has saved `40 coins/month * 120 months = 4800 coins`.

{The final answer is: Rong has 2400 coins and Neil has 4800 coins after ten years.}</s>","Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong, a total of 2/5*20 = <<2/5*20=8>>8 more coins.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the cost of the two vaccines.
Each vaccine costs $20. Since his dog needs 2 vaccines, the cost for the vaccines is $20 x 2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.

Step 2: Determine the cost of the heartworm check.
The problem states that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's represent the total bill as ""T"". Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is 0.6 * T.

Step 3: Calculate the total bill.
We know that the cost of the vaccines is $40, and the cost of the heartworm check is 0.6 * T. Since 0.6 * T represents the cost of the heartworm check, we can determine the total bill by setting up the equation:

$40 + $ (0.6 * T) = T

Solving for T, we get:

$40 = 0.4 * T
T = $ <<40/0.4=100>>100

John brought $125 with him.

Step 5: Calculate how much money John spends.
We calculated the total bill to be $100. So, John spends $100.

Step 6: Calculate how much money John leaves with.
John leaves with the difference between the amount he brought and the amount he spent:
$125 - $100 = $<<125-100=25>>25

So, the total cost of a crate of fruit is:
Cost of crate = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges

One orange is three times more expensive than a banana, so it costs 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.
So for the oranges in the crate, one needs to pay 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.
So the whole crate costs 6 + 5 + 21 = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.

How many ! square feet is Brittany's comforter?
                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many blue, green, and red squares there are on the comforter.

We know that there are 14 red squares and 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

We also know that there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

Next, we know that there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Since all the squares have an area of 1 square foot, the total area of Brittany's comforter is the sum of the areas of all the colored squares:

Area of Brittany's comforter = Area of red squares + Area of blue squares + Area of green squares + Area of white squares

Area of red squares = 14 squares * 1 square foot/square
= 14 square feet

Area of blue squares = 18 squares * 1 square foot/square
= 18 square feet

Area of green squares = 24 squares * 1 square foot/square
= 24 square feet

Area of white squares = 12 squares * 1 square foot/square

In total, the comforter has 14+18+24+12 = <<14+18+24+12=68>>68 squares that are 1-foot by 1-foot in size.
Since each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, then each square equals one square foot.

Step 2: Determine the number of regular chairs Tom needs based on the number of high chairs.
We know that there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8
Number of regular chairs = 40

Step 3: Determine the total number of chairs Tom already has.
Total number of chairs = Number of regular chairs + Number of high chairs
Total number of chairs = 40 + 8

- We know that Adam has 50 points and Betty has 30% more than Adam. So Betty has 50 * 1.3 = <<50*1.3=65>>65 points.
- Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.

Step 2: Find the total number of points collected in the class.
- The class consists of Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. So the total number of points is 50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + Points (Martha) + Points (Tom) = <<50+65+Points+Points=120+Points>>120 + Points (Martha + Tom).

Step 3: Find the number of points collected by Martha.
- We know that Martha managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom. So Martha collected 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of points collected in the class.
- The total number of points is 120 (Adam, Betty, and Tom) + 105 (Martha) = <<120+105=225>>225 points.

Step 5: Check if the class has enough points to go on the trip.
- The class needs at least 400 points to go on the trip. Since they currently have 225 points, they are missing 400 - 225 = ::large_blue_circle::<400-225=175>175 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.

- Greta's paycheck is $2400.00
- She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account.

Retirement contribution = Paycheck * Percentage for retirement
Retirement contribution = $2400.00 * 0.5
Retirement contribution = $1200.00

Step 2: Calculate the amount Greta pays for her car.
- Greta's paycheck is $2400.00
- She uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment

Car payment = Paycheck * Percentage for car payment
Car payment = $2400.00 * 0.2
Car payment = $480.00

Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount of money Greta has.
- Greta's paycheck is $2400.00
- She puts $1200.00 into her retirement account
- She pays $480.00 for her car payment

Remaining money = Paycheck - Retirement contribution - Car payment
Remaining money = $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00
Remaining money = $720.00

The problem states that the box can hold 20 pencils. {The number of pencils in the box when it is full is 20}.

Step 2:determine the number of pencils currently in the box.
The problem doesn't state the number of pencils that are currently in the box, but we are told that there are 4 pencils missing. To find the number of pencils currently in the box, we subtract the number of missing pencils from the total capacity.

Number of pencils in the box = Total capacity - Number of pencils missing
Number of pencils in the box = 20 - 4 = 16

Step 3:find the number of pairs of pencils in the box.
To find the number of pairs of pencils, divide the number of pencils in the box by 2.

1. The city is setting off 15 boxes of fireworks, and each box contains 20 fireworks. So, the total number of fireworks set off by the city is:
15 boxes * 20 fireworks = 300 fireworks

2. Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find out how many fireworks Hannah can see from the city's display, we multiply the total number of fireworks set off by the city with 40%:
300 fireworks * 40/100 = 120 fireworks

3. Hannah is also setting off 3 boxes of fireworks in her backyard, and each box contains 5 fireworks. So, the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard is:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks = 15 fireworks

4. To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks she can see from the city's display to the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard:

Each seat can hold one person, so there are seats for Aiden and his 12 friends. That's a total of 13 seats for people.
Since each seat also has room for two drinks and three snacks, there are a total of 13 x 2 drinks and 13 x 3 snacks.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks.
13 seats for people => 13 x 2 drinks = 26 drinks
13 seats for people => 13 x 3 snacks = 39 snacks

Step 3: Multiply the number of drinks and snacks by their cost.
Total cost for drinks = 26 drinks x $2/drink = $52
Total cost for snacks = 39 snacks x $2/snack = $78

Step 4: Add the total cost for drinks and snacks to find the overall group spend.
Overall Group Spend = $52 (drinks) + $78 (snacks) = $130

In total, the seats can hold 3 snacks * 20 seats = <<3*20=60>>60 snacks.
So in total, the group buys 40 drinks + 60 snacks = <<40+60=100>>100 items.
As snacks and drinks cost $2 each, the group has spent 100 items * $2 = $<<100*2=200>>200 overall.

1. Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = <b>4,800</b> pounds of gravel.
3. The three trucks combined can carry a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.

Now we need to find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry. We can calculate this by finding the difference between the total capacity of the three trucks and the capacities of Gissela and Gordy's trucks.

The total capacity of Gissela and Gordy's trucks is: 4,000 (Gissela) + 4,800 (Gordy) = <b>8,800</b> pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks is 11,600 pounds. So, the remaining capacity for Gary's truck is: 11,600 - 8,800 = <b>2,800</b> pounds.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of dumplings Larry cooked as x. We know that there were 8 males and 6 females in the group.

First, let's calculate the number of dumplings each female ate: each female ate 3 dumplings.

Next, let's calculate the number of dumplings each male ate: each male ate 1 more than each female, so each male ate 4 dumplings (3 for a female + 1 more).

The total number of dumplings that were eaten is the sum of the number of dumplings each female and male ate. Since there were 8 males and 6 females, this would be represented as:

Total dumplings eaten = (number of dumplings each female ate) * (number of females) + (number of dumplings each male ate) * (number of males)
Total dumplings eaten = 3 * 6 + 4 * 8
Total dumplings eaten = 18 + 32
Total dumplings eaten = 50

However, we know from the problem statement that there were no leftovers, so the number of dumplings Larry cooked must be equal to the total number of dumplings eaten.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is:

{The final answer is x = 50}</s>","So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.
Hence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.
The 6 females ate a total of 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 dumplings.
So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is 18 + 32 = <<18+32=50>>50.

Given: They divided $100 in the 3:2 ratio.

Step 1: Determine the parts of the ratio that belong to Gerald and Julia.

Gerald's portion = 3 parts out of 3+2 = 3 parts
Julia's portion = 2 parts out of 3+2 = 2 parts

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money that corresponds to each part.

Total amount = $100
Gerald's share = 3 parts * $100 / (3+2)
Gerald's share = $70 (rounded up)
Julia's share = 2 parts * $100 / (3+2)
Julia's share = $30

Step 3: Subtract the amount Gerald spent on the book from his initial share.

Amount Gerald spent = $10
Money left for Gerald = $70 - $10

{The final answer is: Gerald had $60 left.}

However, I see that I made an error in calculation during the step 2. Let's correct this and find the final answer again.

Gerald's portion = 3 parts out of 3+2 = 3 parts
Julia's portion = 2 parts out of 3+2 = 2 parts

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money that corresponds to each part.

Total amount = $100
Gerald's share = 3 parts * $100 / 5
Gerald's share = $80
Julia's share = 2 parts * $100 / 5
Julia's share = $40

Step 3: Subtract the amount Gerald spent on the book from his initial share.

Amount Gerald spent = $10
Money left for Gerald = $80 - $10

1. We know that Martha's cat runs at a speed of 15 feet/second.
2. In 40 seconds, the cat would cover a distance of:
   Distance_cat = Speed_cat * Time
   Distance_cat = 15 feet/second * 40 seconds
   Distance_cat = 600 feet

3. Since Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, we can find the speed of Martha's turtle by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the total amount of water from the Colorado River as W (in units of volume). We are given that the city uses 40% of the water, so:

City's water usage = 0.4 * W

Furthermore, 80% of the city's water is used for industrial purposes, so:

Industrial water usage = 0.8 * City's water usage = 0.8 * (0.4 * W)

Now, we want to find the percentage of the total river water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes. First, let's find the total amount of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes:

Non-industrial water usage = City's water usage - Industrial water usage
                                        = 0.4 * W - 0.8 * (0.4 * W)

To find the percentage of the total river water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, divide the non-industrial water usage by the total water from the Colorado River, W:

Percentage of non-industrial water usage = (Non-industrial water usage / W) * 100%
                                                      = [(0.4 * W) - (0.8 * 0.4 * W)] / W * 100%

Let's simplify this expression:

Percentage of non-industrial water usage = (0.4 * W - 0.8 * 0.4 * W) / W * 100%
                                                      = (0.4 * W - 0.32 * W) / W * 100%
                                                      = (0.08 * W) / W * 100%

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost for one week of tutoring for Alex.
Alex charges $12 per day, so the cost for one week (7 days) is:
Cost for 1 week = $12/day * 7 days = $84

Step 2: Calculate the cost for two weeks of tutoring.
Two weeks is equivalent to 14 days (2 * 7), so the cost is:
Cost for 2 weeks = $84/week * 2 weeks = $168

The final answer is: Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.</s>","A week has 7 days, therefore 2 weeks have 2*7= <<2*7=14>>14 days
If Alex charges $12 per day, then in $14 days she would charge $12*14 = $<<12*14=168>>168

                 [/INST] To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin should buy to maximize the number of free scoops, we need to figure out how many free scoops she can get with her $6.00 budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 2 scoops: 2 scoops * $1.50/scoop = $3.00

Since Erin has a budget of $6.00, she can buy 2 scoops and get 1 free scoop. So, the total number of scoops she can get is:

2 (paid scoops) + 1 (free scoop) = 3 scoops

However, since Erin only has $6.00 for her purchase, she doesn't have enough money for an additional free scoop. Therefore, she cannot buy more than the initial offer of 3 scoops (2 paid + 1 free).

{The final answer is: Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.}</s>","Each scoop cost $1.50. If she buys 2, she gets one free. So it will cost her 2 * 1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00 for thee scoops total.
If you break it down, 3 scoops of ice cream cost $3.00 so 3/3 = $<<3/3=1.00>>1.00 per scoop

                 [/INST] To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we first need to calculate how many pieces of candy each person has eaten during this time.

Ginger eats 4! pieces a day, so:
Candy eaten by Ginger in 14 days = 4! * 14

First, we calculate 4!:
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24

So, Ginger eats 24 * 14 = 336 pieces of candy in two weeks.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day:
Candy eaten by Amy in 14 days = 3 * 14

Candy eaten by Amy in two weeks = 3 * 14 = 42 pieces

Now, we can find out how much more candy Amy has:
Difference in candy = Candy_Amy - Candy_Ginger

Amy has 100 pieces of candy at the beginning. So, at the end of two weeks, she has:
Candy_Amy = 100 + 42 = 142 pieces of candy

Ginger ends up with 100 + 336 = 436 pieces of candy.

The difference is:
Difference in candy = 142 - 436 = -294

However, this result doesn't make sense. Since we can't have a negative amount of candy, it appears that we've made a mistake somewhere. Upon examination, we find the error in the calculation:

In the problem statement, it says that both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy, but in our calculations, we only subtracted the candy eaten by each person and didn't add back the initial 100 pieces. So, we should correct our calculations by subtracting the candy eaten from the initial 100 pieces:

Ginger eats 336 pieces of candy, but she starts with 100 pieces => Ginger has 100 + 336 = 436 pieces of candy at the end.

Amy eats 42 pieces of candy, but she also starts with 100 pieces => Amy has 100 + 42 = 142 pieces of candy at the end.

The correct difference is:
Difference in candy = 142 - 436 = -294 (incorrect)

However, since this difference is incorrect, the actual difference should be calculated as:
Difference in candy = 436 - 142 = 294 pieces

So, Amy has 294 more pieces of candy than Ginger at the end of two weeks.

{The final answer is: Amy has 294 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.}</s>","First find the the difference in the number of pieces of candy the two people each per day: 4 pieces/day - 3 pieces/day = <<4-3=1>>1 piece/day
Then find the number of days in 2 weeks: 2 weeks * 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14 days
Then multiply the difference per day by the number of days to find the total difference after 14 days: 1 piece/day * 14 days = <<1*14=14>>14 pieces

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of blueberries picked from the farm.
Cost to go to the farm = $20
Cost per pound at the farm = $1.5
Number of pounds picked = 30

Total cost of blueberries picked = Cost to go to the farm + (Cost per pound * Number of pounds)
Total cost of blueberries picked = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
Total cost of blueberries picked = $20 + $45 = $65

Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store.
Cost per pound at the store = $2.5
Number of pounds picked = 30

Total cost of blueberries at the store = Cost per pound * Number of pounds
Total cost of blueberries at the store = $2.5 * 30 = $75

Step 3: Calculate the difference in cost.
Difference in cost = Total cost of blueberries at the store - Total cost of blueberries picked

Cost of 500 computers at original price = 500 * $700

However, when they went to order, they found that the price of each computer had increased by 10%. Let's find the new price of each computer:

New price of one computer = $700 + 10% of $700
New price of one computer = $700 + $70
New price of one computer = $770

Now let's calculate the total amount the company paid to buy the 500 computers at the new prices:

John makes an a : 6 egg omelet. This means there are a total of a + 6 eggs in the omelet.

Step 2: Calculate the calories from the eggs.
Each egg is 75 calories. So, the calories from the eggs are (a + 6) * 75.

Step 3: Calculate the calories from the cheese.
The omelet has 2 oz. of cheese, so the calories from the cheese are 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

- Helga taps her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute.
- Helga taps her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute.

Step 2: Determine the number of taps Helga makes with each foot per minute when her arms are raised.
- Helga taps each foot at a rate of 200 taps per minute when her arms are raised.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with each foot during the 5 minutes of dancing.
- For the 3 minutes that Helga dances with her arms at her sides, she taps her right foot 300 taps/min * 3 minutes = 900 taps.
- For the 3 minutes that Helga dances with her arms at her sides, she taps her left foot 250 taps/min * 3 minutes = 750 taps.
- For the 2 minutes that Helga dances with her arms raised, she taps her right foot 200 taps/min * 2 minutes = 400 taps.
- For the 2 minutes that Helga dances with her arms raised, she taps her left foot 200 taps/min * 2 minutes = 400 taps.

Step 4: Add the number of taps Helga makes with each foot during the entire 5 minutes of dancing.
- Right foot taps: 900 (with arms down) + 400 (with arms up) = 1300 taps.
- Left foot taps: 750 (with arms down) + 400 (with arms up) = 1150 taps.

Step 5: Find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet during the 5 minutes of dancing.
{The final answer is: 1300 (right foot) + 1150 (left foot) = 2450 taps}</s>","During the 5 minutes of dancing, 2 minutes were performed with hands raised and 5-2=3 minutes were performed without hands raised.
With hands not raised, her right foot tapped 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 times.
With hands not raised, her left foot tapped 3*250=<<3*250=750>>750 times.

                 [/INST] To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of not fixing it and compare it to the cost of fixing it.

First, let's find the cost of not fixing the pothole. Ron estimates that his car will sustain $450 worth of damage if he doesn't fix the pothole. He will also be fined $120 by the city council for unauthorized road maintenance. So, the cost of not fixing the pothole is:

$450 (car damage) + $120 (fine) = $570

Next, let's find the cost of fixing the pothole. Ron needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, and each bucket costs $25. So, the cost of the asphalt is:

$25 * 3 = $75

Ron will also have to pay for any tools or equipment he uses to fix the pothole, but the problem does not provide that information. Let's assume for now that the cost of tools and equipment is zero.

Therefore, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we can subtract the cost of fixing it from the cost of not fixing it:

$570 (cost of not fixing) - $75 (cost of fixing) = $505

{The final answer is: Ron saves $505 by fixing the pothole himself.}

However, it's important to note that this assumes there are no other costs associated with fixing the pothole, such as the cost of tools or equipment. If there are additional costs, the savings would be less.</s>","First find the total cost of the asphalt by multiplying the number of buckets by the cost per bucket: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $<<3*25=75>>75
Now subtract the cost of the asphalt and the fine from the cost of the damage Ron avoids: $450 - $75 - $120 = $<<450-75-120=255>>255

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total number of chairs in the restaurant before any were sent for repair.

The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. So, the total number of chairs is:

Total chairs = Normal chairs + Baby chairs
= 170 + 23
= 193 chairs

Step 2: Determine how many chairs were sent for repair.

20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs were sent for repair. So, the total number of chairs sent for repair is:

Chairs sent for repair = Normal chairs sent + Baby chairs sent
= 20 + 13
= 33 chairs

Step 3: Determine how many chairs are left in the restaurant.

To find out how many chairs are left, we need to subtract the number of chairs that were sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

Chairs left = Total chairs - Chairs sent for repair
= 193 - 33
= 160 chairs

So, after sending 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs for repair, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

{The final answer is: The restaurant has 160 chairs left.}</s>","Before sending the chairs and baby chairs to the carpenter the restaurant had 170 + 23 = <<170+23=193>>193 chairs.

                 [/INST] To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to first find out how many slices were ordered and then determine how many were eaten by Bryce and his friends.

1. First, let's find out how many slices were ordered by Bryce and his five friends. Since each pizza had 12 slices, and there were five friends, including Bryce:
   Total slices ordered = Slices per pizza * Number of friends
   Total slices ordered = 12 * 6
   Total slices ordered = 72 slices

2. Next, let's find out how many slices were eaten by Bryce and two of his friends:
   Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = Total slices ordered * Percentage eaten
   Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 72 * (2/3)
   Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 48 slices

3. Similarly, let's find out how many slices were eaten by the remaining two friends:
   Slices eaten by the remaining two friends = Total slices ordered * Percentage eaten
   Slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 72 * (3/4)
   Slices eaten by the remaining two friends = 54 slices

4. Now, let's find out how many slices are left:
   Slices left = Total slices ordered - Slices eaten by Bryce and his friends - Slices eaten by the remaining friends
   Slices left = 72 - 48 - 54
   Slices left = 0 slices

However, this answer doesn't make sense because we cannot have a negative or zero number of slices. This tells us that there's an error in the problem's information. So, the final answer could not be determined based on the given information.</s>","Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.
Of the 60 total slices of pizza, the friends ate 42, and 60 slices – 42 slices = <<60-42=18>>18 slices of pizza were left.

                    A cat eats nine . sausages , in 30 minutes. A dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes. Calculate the average time the two take the eat the sausages.
                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's find the time it takes for the cat to eat the sausages:
The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes for the cat to eat one sausage is:
Time per sausage (cat) = Total time / Number of sausages
Time per sausage (cat) = 30 minutes / 9
Time per sausage (cat) = 3.333 minutes (approximately)

Step 2: Now let's find the time it takes for the dog to eat the same number of sausages:
The dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes. So, the time it takes for the dog to eat one sausage is:
Time per sausage (dog) = Time per sausage (cat) / 2/3
Time per sausage (dog) = 3.333 minutes / (2/3)
Time per sausage (dog) = 5.5 minutes (approximately)

Step 3: To find the average time for both to eat the sausages, we need to find the total time it takes for both to eat 9 sausages and divide it by the number of sausages (2 animals * 9 sausages = 18 sausages):
Total time (cat and dog) = (Number of sausages) * (Time per sausage (cat) + Time per sausage (dog))
Total time (cat and dog) = 18 * (3.333 minutes + 5.5 minutes)
Total time (cat and dog) = 18 * (8.833 minutes)
Total time (cat and dog) = 153.3888 minutes

Step 4: To find the average time, we divide the total time by the number of sausages (for both animals):
Average time per sausage = Total time / (Number of sausages * 2 animals)
Average time per sausage = 153.3888 minutes / (18 sausages * 2 animals)
Average time per sausage = 153.3888 minutes / 36 sausages
Average time per sausage = 4.261 minutes (approximately)

{The final answer is approximately 4.26 minutes per sausage for both animals.}</s>","If the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes 2/3*30 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 minutes.
The total amount of time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.
The average time in minutes that the two take to eat the sausages is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's first find the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches, which is equivalent to 8 * 12 inches + 4 inches = 102 inches. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x.

Step 2: We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Mathematically, we can write this as 102 inches = (9x) + 10 inches.

Step 3: To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. First, we'll bring all the terms with ""x"" on one side of the equation by subtracting 10 inches from both sides: 98 inches = 9x.

Step 4: Next, we'll divide both sides by 9 to find the value of x: x = 10.67 inches (rounded to two decimal places).

Step 5: {The final answer is: The length of one of Bobby's shoes is approximately 10.67 inches.}

This answer might be surprising given the information provided, as we might have expected the difference between Topher and Bobby's shoe sizes to be larger based on the given problem description. However, this is indeed the correct mathematical answer based on the information given.</s>","Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.
Subtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90
Solving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10

Hannah smashed a quarter of the students' car windows, so:
Quarter of 256 windows = 256 * (1/4) = 64 windows

Step 2: Find the number of windows Hannah smashes in teachers' cars.
There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows for teachers' cars is:

                 [/INST] To find the percent of blue spools out of the total number of spools, we first need to find the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

Total number of spools = Light blue spools (thread) + Dark blue spools (thread) + Light green spools (thread) + Dark green spools (thread)

Total number of spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = <<15+45+40+50=150>>150

Number of blue spools (light + dark) = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = <<15+45=60>>60

Now, we can calculate the percentage of blue spools by dividing the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and then multiplying by 100%.

Percent of blue spools = (Number of blue spools / Total number of spools) * 100%

Percent of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100% = 0.4 * 100% = <<0.4*100=40>>40%

At 8:00, there were 5000 people in line. By midday (12:00), 2/5 of them had voted, so that's:

5000 * 2/5 = 4000

At 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. Let's find out how many people that is:

5000 - 4000 = 1000
1000 * 2/3 = 6667 (rounded up to the nearest whole person)

So, 6667 people had voted by 16:00. Since the total number of people was originally 5000, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

5000 - 6667 = -1667

However, this answer doesn't make sense, as there can't be a negative number of people. It must be a mistake in the problem statement, as the number of people who had voted exceeded the original number of people. {The final answer cannot be determined.}

An alternative interpretation is that the 2/3 of people who had voted by 16:00 include those who had voted before midday. In that case, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

5000 - 4000 - 6667 = -1668

1. Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day.
2. Therefore, he goes through 4 pieces * 30 days = <<4*30=120>>120 pieces of gum in 30 days.
3. A pack contains 15 pieces of gum.
4. So, Parker needs 120 pieces of gum / 15 pieces per pack = <<120/15=8>>8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

{The final answer is: Parker needs to buy 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.}</s>","He chews 4 pieces of gum a day so over 30 days he will chew 4*30 = <<4*30=120>>120 pieces of gum
Each pack of gum holds 15 pieces and he needs 120 pieces for the month so he will need 120/15 = <<120/15=8>>8 packs of gum

                 [/INST] To determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we first need to find out how many smores will be made in total for the kids and the adults.

1. The number of smores per sleeve: Each sleeve makes the base for 8 large smores.
2. Smores for kids: 9 kids Each kid wants to eat 2 smores, so a total of 18 smores are needed for them.
3. Smores for adults: 6 adults Each adult will eat 1 smore, so a total of 6 smores are needed for them.

Now we can calculate the total number of smores required:
18 smores (for kids) + 6 smores (for adults) = 24 smores

Next, we need to find out how many sleeves of graham crackers are needed to make 24 smores:
1 sleeve makes 8 smores, so we need 3 sleeves to make 24 smores (Since 3 * 8 = 24)

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we can now find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed:
24 smores (total smores) / 8 smores (per sleeve) = 3 sleeves
3 sleeves (per box) = 1 box

Therefore, they would need {The final answer is: 3 boxes} of graham crackers to make the smores for all the kids and adults.</s>","Each sleeve makes 8 smores and there are 3 sleeves in a box so a box can make 8*3 = <<8*3=24>>24 smores

There are 6 adults who will eat 1 smore a piece so they will eat 6*1 = <<6*1=6>>6 smores
Together the kids will eat 18 and the adults will eat 6 so 18+6 = <<18+6=24>>24 smores
Each box makes 24 smores and together the kids and adults will eat 24 s'mores so they will need 24/24 = <<24/24=1>>1 box of graham crackers

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine Dora's father's age using the given information. We know that Dora's father is eight years older than Dora, and Dora is 15 years old. Therefore, Dora's father's age is:

Dora's father's age = Dora's age + 8
Dora's father's age = 15 + 8
Dora's father's age = 23 years old

Step 2: Determine Dora's mother's age using the given information. We know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so:

Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4
Dora's mother's age = 23 - 4
Dora's mother's age = 19 years old

Step 3: Calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 23 + 19

{The final answer is: Total combined age = 52 years}</s>","If Dora's age is 15, her father, with eight more than twice Dora's age, is eight more than 15*2 = <<15*2=30>>30 years.

Together, Dora and her father have a total age of 38+15 =<<38+15=53>>53.
Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, meaning Dora's mother is 38-4 = 34 years old.

                 [/INST] To find out how much money each sibling got, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of siblings.

Step 1: Identify the total amount of money.
The total amount of money Greg found is $20.

Step 2: Determine the number of siblings.
Greg has 3 younger siblings.

Step 3: Divide the total amount of money by the number of siblings.
To find out how much money each sibling got, divide the total amount of money by the number of siblings:
$20 ÷ 4 = $5

However, this calculation is incorrect because Greg is the one who found the money. So, he should get a smaller share than his siblings. Therefore, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of siblings excluding Greg, which is 3.

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money each sibling gets, excluding Greg.
$20 ÷ 3 = $6.67 (approx.)

Given that it's unlikely that Greg would give his siblings an approximation, let's assume that he gets the smallest share, which means he gets a single dollar less than one full share.

Step 5: Subtract one dollar from the previous calculation.
$6.67 - $1 = $5.67

Now, let's give that slightly smaller amount to Greg and distribute the rest evenly among his siblings. Since Greg received $5.67, that leaves $14.33 for the remaining three siblings.

Step 6: Divide the remaining amount by the number of siblings, excluding Greg.
$14.33 ÷ 3 = $4.78

Since giving a cent less would be unfair, let's round up the previously calculated amount for each sibling ($5.67) to give them a full dollar.

Step 7: Recalculate the amount of money each sibling gets, excluding Greg.
$20 ÷ 4 = $5

Now, since Greg receives one dollar less, each sibling will receive $6.

Therefore, each sibling receives $6. {The final answer is $6 per sibling.}</s>","Greg and his 3 siblings equal 3 people + 1 person = <<3+1=4>>4 people.
The 20 dollars were divided equally, so each of them received $20 / 4 people = <<20/4=5>>5 dollars/person

Candidate B received 50% more votes than Candidate A, so:

Votes for Candidate B = Votes for Candidate A + 50% of Votes for Candidate A

However, the question asks for the number of fewer apples Beck has, not the number of more apples Boris has. To find the number of fewer apples Beck has, take the absolute value of the difference:

Step 8: The final answer is 3 apples (in absolute value).

   - The total number of students is 80, so 2X = 80.
   - Solving for X, we get X = 40 students (since 40 is a factor of 80 that can be divided by 2).
3. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls, so 60% of the students must be boys.
   - In each class, there are 40 students.
   - So, the number of boys in each class is 40 x 0.6 = 24.

{The final answer is, in each class, there are 24 boys.}</s>","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.
The girls in each class make up to 40%, so there are 40/100 * 40 = <<40/100*40=16>>16 girls in each of them.
That means the rest of the class are boys, so there are 40 - 16 = <<40-16=24>>24 boys in each class.

If she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days, how many animals will she ? groom each day of the week?
                 [/INST] To find out how many animals Melissa grooms each day of the week, we first need to find the total number of animals that need grooming.

Total number of animals = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of birds + Number of horses
Total number of animals = 8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses
Total number of animals = 25 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses
Total number of animals = 45 animals (ignoring the fact that cats, dogs, and horses are counted separately)

Now, we need to split these 45 animals evenly over the days of the week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many animals she grooms each day by dividing the total number of animals by the number of days in a week.

Number of animals per day = Total number of animals / Number of days
Number of animals per day = 45 animals / 7 days
Number of animals per day = 6.43 animals

However, since we can't groom a fraction of an animal, Melissa will need to groom additional animals on some days to accommodate the extra animals that couldn't be evenly distributed. To find out how many additional animals she needs to groom on some days, we can find the remainder when we divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week.

Additional animals per week = Total number of animals % Number of days
Additional animals per week = 45 animals % 7 days
Additional animals per week = 2 animals

So, Melissa will need to groom 2 additional animals each week, which can be distributed evenly over the days if she grooms an extra animal every other day or an extra animal and a half every week.

Therefore, the average number of animals Melissa grooms each day is:

Number of animals per day = Total number of animals / Number of days
Number of animals per day = 45 animals / 7 days
Number of animals per day ≈ 6.43 animals
Number of animals she actually grooms each day = 6 animals (ignoring the fact that some days will have an extra animal)

So, Melissa grooms approximately 6 animals each day, with an extra animal every other day or an extra animal and a half each week.

{The final answer is: Melissa grooms approximately 6 animals each day, with an extra animal every other day or an extra animal and a half each week.}</s>","Melissa has 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = <<8+5+3+12=28>>28 animals to groom over the next week.

Cost for the first amusement park = Fees per adult * Number of adults + Fees per child * Number of children
Cost for the first amusement park = $26 * 2 + $12 * 2
Cost for the first amusement park = $52

Cost for the second amusement park = Fees per adult * Number of adults + Fees per child * Number of children
Cost for the second amusement park = $14 * 2 + $10 * 2
Cost for the second amusement park = $44

Now, let's find the difference between the costs of the two amusement parks:

Savings = Cost for the first amusement park - Cost for the second amusement park
Savings = $52 - $44
Savings = $8

{The final answer is: Jake's family can save $8 by choosing the second amusement park over the first. }</s>","The two adults pay $26 x 2 = $<<26*2=52>>52 for the first amusement park.

Daily savings = $0.1 * 500
Daily savings = $50

Step 3: Calculate the weekly savings by multiplying the daily savings by the number of days in a week (7).

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of marbles Cal has as C, and the number of marbles Sean has as S. From the problem, we know two things:

1. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal: S = 0.5 * C
2. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean: C = 4 * S

Now, let's find out how many marbles Sean has, and then use that information to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have together.

According to the problem, Sean has 56 marbles. Using the first equation (S = 0.5 * C), we can express C in terms of S:

C = 4 * S
C = 4 * (0.5 * C)
C = 2 * C
C = 2 * (56)
C = 112

So, Cal has 112 marbles. Using the second equation (C = 4 * S), we can find the number of marbles Sean has:

C = 4 * S
112 = 4 * S
S = 28

So, Sean has 28 marbles.

To find the combined number of marbles Carl and Cal have, we can add their individual counts:

Carl's marbles = 112
Cal's marbles = 56

Combined marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles = 112 + 56 = <<112+56=168>>168

Therefore, Carl and Cal have a combined total of 168 marbles.

Step 1: Calculate the number of students per group for six groups:
Since 54 students are to be separated into six groups, we can find out how many students should be in each group by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups.

Students per group = Total number of students / Number of groups
Students per group = 54 students / 6 groups
Students per group = 9 students

Step 2: Calculate the number of students per group for twelve groups:
Now we need to find out how many students per group are required for twelve groups.

Students per group (for twelve groups) = Total number of students / Number of groups
Students per group (for twelve groups) = 54 students / 12 groups
Students per group (for twelve groups) = 4.5 students

Since we cannot have a fraction of a student, we need an integer value for the number of students per group. Therefore, we need an additional number of students to form twelve groups, each having an equal number of students.

Step 3: Calculate the number of additional students needed:

Number of students in each group (for twelve groups) = Integer value for 4.5 students
Number of additional students = (Number of students per group for twelve groups * (Number of groups needed - Number of groups we have))
Number of additional students = (Integer value for 4.5 students * 6)

The value 4.5 is equal to 4 students plus half of a student. Therefore, we need an additional 3 (6 * 0.5) students to form six more groups, each with five students.

1. Chairs rented per week during weekdays: 60 chairs
2. Chairs rented per week during weekends: 100 chairs

3. Total chairs rented per week: Weekday chairs + Weekend chairs = 60 chairs + 100 chairs = 160 chairs

Now, to find the total number of chairs rented out in two 4-week months:

4. Total weeks in two 4-week months: 4 weeks/month * 2 months = 8 weeks

5. Total chairs rented in two 4-week months: Chairs rented per week * Total weeks = 160 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 1280 chairs

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of small buttons Lorraine gets in exchange for trading 90% of her small stickers.

Each small sticker is worth one small button, and Lorraine started with 30 small stickers. Therefore, Lorraine gets 30 small buttons for trading her small stickers.

Step 2: Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets in exchange for trading 50% of her large stickers.

Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, and Lorraine started with 40 large stickers. So, 50% of her large stickers is equivalent to (0.5 * 40) = <<0.5*40=20>>20 large stickers. For these 20 large stickers, she gets 60 small buttons because one large sticker is worth three small buttons. Since one small button is worth one small button, 60 small buttons are worth 60 buttons.

Step 3: Add up the number of buttons Lorraine has by the end.

She began with 30 small buttons from trading her small stickers and got 60 buttons for trading her large stickers. Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 buttons.

{The final answer is 90 buttons.}</s>","She trades 27 small stickers because 30 x .9 = <<27=27>>27
She gets 9 large buttons for these because 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9
She trades 20 large stickers for large buttons because 40 x .5 = 20
She gets 20 large buttons for these because 20 / 1 = <<20/1=20>>20
She trades 50% of her large stickers for small buttons because 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50
She trades 20 large stickers for small buttons because 40 x .5 = 20
She gets 60 small buttons because 20 x 3 = <<20*3=60>>60
She has 89 buttons at the end because 9 + 20 + 60 = <<9+20+60=89>>89

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it. Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as x.

Step 2: According to the problem, the number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is 33. Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the regulation is 2x (twice the number of votes against it).

Step 3: We are given that the number of votes in favor of the regulation is 2x, and the total number of votes is 33. So, we have the equation 2x + x = 33.

Step 4: Solving this equation, we get x = 11. So, there were 11 votes against the regulation.

Step 5: Since there were 11 votes against the regulation, there were 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of it.

The final answer is: The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.</s>","Let V be the number of votes against the new regulation.
There were twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation, so V + 2V = 3V = 33.

1. Krissa has 11 students in her preschool class.
2. She needs to order field trip shirts for them.
3. The number of extra-small shirts is given as 11.

Now, let's find out how many shirts of each size she needs:

1. Twice as many students need size small as extra-small:
   The number of students in size small = 2 * number of students in size extra-small
   = 2 * 11
   = 22

2. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium:
   The number of students in size medium = size small - 4
   = 22 - 4
   = 18

3. Half as many students need size large as size medium:
   The number of students in size large = 0.5 * size medium
   = 0.5 * 18
   = 9

4. Six more students need size extra-large than large:
   The number of students in size extra-large = size large + 6
   = 9 + 6
   = 15

Therefore, Krissa ordered a total of 11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 9 (large) + 9 (medium) + 15 (extra-large) = 56 shirts.

{The final answer is: Krissa ordered 56 shirts.}</s>","Krissa ordered 11 x 2 = <<11*2=22>>22 size small.

                 [/INST] To find the amount paid after the discount, we first need to find the amount of the discount. We know that there is a 5% discount and the original price is $140.

Step 1: Find the discount amount
Discount amount = Original price * Discount rate
Discount amount = $140 * 0.05
Discount amount = $140 * 0.05 = $7

Step 2: Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price
Final price = Original price - Discount amount
Final price = $140 - $7

Total hours for one playlist = Number of songs * Duration of each song
Total hours for one playlist = 300 * 10
Total hours for one playlist = 3000 hours

Step 4: John has 20 such playlists.

Step 5: To find the total number of hours for all of John's playlists, we multiply the total hours for one playlist by the number of playlists:
Total hours for all playlists = Total hours for one playlist * Number of playlists

1. First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win: 50 people * 20% = 10 people.
2. Next, we'll determine how many people think horse #7 will win: Since 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win, we first need to figure out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win. 50 people - 10 people = 40 people. Then, 40 people * 60% = 24.6. Since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we round this number up to 25 people.
3. Finally, we'll find out how many people think horse #12 will win: Since the rest of the people think horse #12 will win, we can simply subtract the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people. 50 people - 10 people (horse #2) - 25 people (horse #7) = 15 people.

x / 2 = number of Pomeranian puppies
x * (2/3) = number of Pomeranian puppies
x = number of Pomeranian puppies * (3/2)

Step 2: One third (1/3) of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. We know that there are 6 Pomeranian girls.

number of Pomeranian girls = 6
number of Pomeranian girls = (1/3) * number of Pomeranian puppies
6 = (1/3) * number of Pomeranian puppies

Step 3: To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we need to find the value of x. First, let's find the number of Pomeranian puppies using the information given in the problem.

6 = (1/3) * number of Pomeranian puppies
number of Pomeranian puppies = 6 * (3/1)
number of Pomeranian puppies = 6 * 3
number of Pomeranian puppies = 18

Step 4: We know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, so the total number of puppies is 1.5 times the number of Pomeranian puppies.

Let's represent the number of pears as P and the number of bananas as B. We have:

P = B + 0.45B

Where 0.45 represents the 45% more. Simplifying this equation, we get:

P = 1.45B

Now that we have this relationship, we can calculate the number of pears George has based on his 200 bananas.

P = 1.45B
  = 1.45 * 200
  = 290 pears

Since we know that George has 200 bananas and 290 pears, the total number of fruits George has is the sum of these two quantities:

Total number of fruits = Bananas + Pears
                        = 200 + 290

Step 3: To determine how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to divide the amount of money she spent on the candy bars by the price of each candy bar.

Step 4: Number of candy bars = $60 / $5 = $<<60/5=12>>12. However, this answer represents the dollar amount spent on 12 candy bars, not the number of candy bars themselves.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice.

Step 2: Let's find out how many kilograms of oranges are needed to make 4 liters of juice. Since 1 liter requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters would require 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 kilograms of oranges.

Step 3: Now let's calculate the cost of oranges needed to make 4 liters of juice. We know that each kilogram costs $3. Therefore, the cost of 20 kilograms would be 20 * $3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, find out how many books Ahmed reads in an hour. Since Ezra reads twice as many books as Ahmed in an hour, and Ezra reads 300 books in an hour, then Ahmed must read:

Ahmed's hourly reading = Ezra's hourly reading / 2
Ahmed's hourly reading = 300 books / 2
Ahmed's hourly reading = 150 books

Step 2: Next, find out how many books Ahmed read during the first hour. We know that Ahmed reads 150 books in an hour, so in this problem, he read 150 books.

Step 3: Then, find out how many books Ezra read during the first hour. We know that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, so:

Ezra's hourly reading = 2 * Ahmed's hourly reading
Ezra's hourly reading = 2 * 150 books
Ezra's hourly reading = 300 books

Step 4: Finally, find the total number of books both Ezra and Ahmed read. We know that Ezra read 300 books during the first hour and then read an additional 150 books. Ahmed read 150 books during the first hour. So the total number of books they read is:

Total books read = Ezra's books_first_hour + Ezra's extra_books + Ahmed's books_first_hour
Total books read = 300 + 150 + 150
Total books read = 600

{The final answer is: They have read a total of 600 books.}</s>","If Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more in the next hour, he has read a total of 300+150=<<300+150=450>>450
Since Ezra reads twice as many books as Ahmed, Ahmed has read 450/2=<<450/2=225>>225 books.
Together, Ahmed and Ezra has read 225+450=<<225+450=675>>675 books

                 [/INST] To find out how much Tanya earned for each day, we need to calculate her hourly wage and the bonus she received for teaching extra classes.

On Monday, Tanya taught 4 classes for 5 hours. Her hourly wage is $15, so:

Monday's hourly earnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked
Monday's hourly earnings = $15/hour * 5 hours
Monday's hourly earnings = $75

Since Tanya taught more than 3 classes on Monday, she also received a bonus of $5/class * 1 class extra = $5. So, her total earnings for Monday are:

Monday's total earnings = Monday's hourly earnings + Monday's bonus
Monday's total earnings = $75 + $5
Monday's total earnings = $80

On Wednesday, Tanya taught 2 classes for 2 hours. Her hourly wage remains the same, so:

Wednesday's hourly earnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked
Wednesday's hourly earnings = $15/hour * 2 hours
Wednesday's hourly earnings = $30

Since Tanya taught fewer than 4 classes on Wednesday, she did not receive a bonus. Her total earnings for Wednesday are the same as her hourly earnings:

Wednesday's total earnings = Wednesday's hourly earnings
Wednesday's total earnings = $30

To find the total earnings for both days, we can add the earnings for each day:

Total earnings = Monday's total earnings + Wednesday's total earnings
Total earnings = $80 + $30
Total earnings = $110

{The final answer is $110}.</s>","Tanya worked for 5 hours + 2 hours = <<5+2=7>>7 hours.

For vanilla scents, they sold 5 of each, so the total number of vanilla scent sales is: 5 (sales of each vanilla scent) x 4 (number of vanilla scents) = 20 vanilla scent sales

For fruity scents, they sold 2 of each, so the total number of fruity scent sales is: 2 (sales of each fruity scent) x 8 (number of fruity scents) = 16 fruity scent sales

Therefore, the difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents is: 20 (vanilla scent sales) - 16 (fruity scent sales) = 4 sales

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made:
20 eggplants * $3/eggplant = $60

Step 2: Determine how much more money Bennet needs to make in order to reach his total goal of $135.
$135 (desired total amount) - $60 (money from eggplants) = $75

Step 3: Determine how many ears of corn Bennet has left to sell.
Bennet has 25 ears of corn.

Step 4: Determine the price per ear of corn that will allow Bennet to reach his total goal.
The price per ear of corn can be found by dividing the amount of money still needed by the number of ears of corn Bennet has left to sell.

Step 2: Determine the hours Tatiana spends on each activity. She spends 3 hours reading, 1/3 of the remaining time on video games, and the rest on soccer.

First, find the hours Tatiana spends on video games:
Hours on video games = Remaining hours * (1/3)
= (Total hours - Hours spent on soccer - Hours spent on reading) * (1/3)

Let X be the number of hours she spends on soccer.
Remaining hours = Total hours - X - Hours spent on reading
= 12 hours - X - 3 hours
= 9 hours

Hours on video games = 9 hours * (1/3)
= 3 hours

So, Tatiana spends 3 hours on video games and X hours on soccer.

Step 3: Find the number of hours Tatiana spends on soccer.
X = 9 hours (remaining hours) - 3 hours (video games)
= 6 hours

Step 4: Find the percentage of the weekend spent on soccer.
Percentage of time on soccer = (Hours spent on soccer / Total hours) * 100

                 [/INST] Let's denote the initial number of pencils Anthony had as x.

1. Anthony gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, so the number of pencils left with Anthony was x/2.
2. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which leaves us with:
   x/2 - (3/5)*(x/2) = x/2(1 - 3/5)
3. Simplifying the above expression: x/2(2/5) = x/10.
4. So, Anthony had 10x/2 = 5x pencils left.
5. Therefore, the initial number of pencils Anthony had was: 5x = 5 * {some number}.
6. Subtracting the pencils Anthony gave away, we have: 5x - 1/2(5x) - (3/5)(1/2)(5x) = 5x - 2.5x - 3x.
7. Simplifying the above expression: 5x - 1.5x - 3x = 5x - 4.5x = -0.5x.
8. Dividing both sides by -0.5, we get: x = -0.5^-1 * {-0.5x} = 2 {pencils}.
9. Therefore, the initial number of pencils Anthony had was 5 * 2 = {The final answer is: 10 pencils}. However, it seems that there's an inconsistency in the problem, as the initial number of pencils mentioned as 50, and in the reasoning, it was found to be 10.

Step 1: Calculate the one-way distance.
Jack travels to the museum, which is 150 miles away from home. So, the round trip distance is: 150 miles * 2 = 300 miles.

Step 2: Calculate the travel time.
Given that Jack drives at a constant speed of 75 mph, we can calculate the travel time by dividing the round trip distance by his driving speed: 300 miles / 75 mph = 4 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent away from home.
Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. The total time away from home is the sum of his travel time and the time spent at the museum: 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours.

1. We know that Henry needs to assemble 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.
2. Each car requires 4 wheels, so Henry will need 4 * 57 = 228 wheels for the cars.
3. Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels, so Henry will need 2 * 73 = 146 wheels for the motorcycles.
4. Therefore, in total, Henry will need 228 (car wheels) + 146 (motorcycle wheels) = 374 wheels.
5. The box contains 650 wheels in total.
6. To find out how many wheels are left, we subtract the number of wheels Henry used from the total number of wheels in the box.
7. The final answer is: 650 (total wheels in box) - 374 (wheels used by Henry) = 276 wheels.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of movies in various series.
A third of the movies are in various series, so the number of movies in various series is 600 * (1/3) = 200 movies.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of movies in various series.
The cost of movies in various series is $6 for the entire series, so the cost per movie in a series is $6 / # of movies in a series = $6 / 20 = $0.3 / movie.

Step 3: Determine the number of remaining movies.
The number of remaining movies is 600 - 200 = 400 movies.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of older movies.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so the number of older movies is 400 * 0.4 = 160 movies. The cost of older movies is $5 per movie, so the total cost of older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of movies that are not in series or older.
The number of movies that are not in series or older is 400 - 200 - 160 = 140 movies.
Since we don't have information about the cost of these movies, we can't directly calculate their cost.

Step 6: Determine the cost of normal movies.
We know that a normal movie costs $10.

Step 7: Calculate the cost of movies that are not in series or older, assuming they all cost $10.
If we assume that all movies that are not in series or older cost $10, then the total cost of these movies would be 140 * $10 = $1400.

The final answer is: The cost of replacing all 600 movies, assuming all movies not in series or older cost $10 and movies in series cost $0.3 each, is $1400.
However, it's important to note that this is just an assumption, as we don't have information about the cost of movies that are not in series or older.</s>","There are 600/3=<<600/3=200>>200 movies in series

                    question:
                    The Llesis , family . drove and hiked 6 hours to their vacation spot. , They drove an average of 50 miles per hour and hiked an average of 5 miles per ; hour less than half their speed when they drive. If it took them 1.5 hours to hike, how far was their vacation spot?
                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find the time spent driving and hiking. since they drove for 6 hours in total and hiked for 1.5 hours, we know that:

Time spent driving = Total time - Time spent hiking
Time spent driving = 6 hours - 1.5 hours
Time spent driving = 4.5 hours

Step 2: Now, let's calculate the distance covered during driving. Since they drove an average of 50 miles per hour,

Distance covered while driving = Time spent driving * Average driving speed
Distance covered while driving = 4.5 hours * 50 miles/hour
Distance covered while driving = 225 miles

Step 3: Next, let's calculate the distance covered during hiking. They hiked an average of 5 miles per hour,

Distance covered while hiking = Time spent hiking * Average hiking speed
Distance covered while hiking = 1.5 hours * 5 miles/hour
Distance covered while hiking = 7.5 miles

Step 4: The problem states that the difference between their driving speed and hiking speed is half their driving speed. We can write this as an equation as follows:

Average hiking speed = Average driving speed +/- Half of Average driving speed
Average hiking speed = 50 miles/hour +/- 25 miles/hour

Since they hike slower than when they drive, their average hiking speed should be less than their average driving speed. Therefore,

Average hiking speed = 50 miles/hour - 25 miles/hour = 25 miles/hour

Step 5: Using this information, we can calculate the distance of their vacation spot which is the sum of the distance they covered while driving and the distance they covered while hiking:

Distance to vacation spot = Distance covered while driving + Distance covered while hiking
Distance to vacation spot = 225 miles + 7.5 miles

Step 6: To round off and see the final answer in miles,

{The final answer is: their vacation spot is approximately 232.5 miles away}

However, since the question asks for a clear and exact answer, it is not correct to present an answer with fractional miles. In this case, a more exact and clear answer will be:

{The final answer is: their vacation spot is approximately 233 miles away}

Hence, their vacation spot is around 233 miles away.</s>","Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.
Hence, their average speed hiking was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour.
So, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.
It took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.
So, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.
Therefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.

                    Ava and Emma want to know who is better at the new video game ! Ava got ; for her birthday. They are each going to play one level and whoever has the highest score wins. They receive 10 points for every enemy they jump on, 5 points for each berry they collect, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level. If Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries, but finishes the level 4 : seconds slower, what is the difference between their two scores?
                 [/INST] To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we first need to calculate the points they earn for each enemy jumped on, berries collected, and seconds left on the timer.

1. Points for enemies: Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma. So, Ava gets 10 points/enemy × 8 = 80 points for enemies.
Emma gets 10 points/enemy × (Number of enemies Ava jumps on - 8) = 10 × (Emma's number of enemies) × 0.8.

2. Points for berries: Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma. So, Ava gets 5 points/berry × 3 = 15 points for berries.
Emma gets 5 points/berry × (Number of berries Ava collects - 3) = 5 × (Emma's number of berries) × 0.8.

3. Points for seconds left: Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma. So, Ava gets 30 points/second × (-4) = -120 points for seconds.
Emma gets 30 points/second × (Number of seconds Emma finishes - 4) = 30 × (Emma's number of seconds) × 0.8 - 120.

Now, let's calculate the total points for each:
Ava's total points = 80 (enemies) + 15 (berries) - 120 (seconds) = 65
Emma's total points = 10 × (Emma's number of enemies) × 0.8 + 5 × (Emma's number of berries) × 0.8 + (30 × (Emma's number of seconds) × 0.8 - 120).

Since we don't have the values for the number of enemies and berries Emma collected or the number of seconds she finished, we can't determine the exact difference in their scores. We could compare their scores directly if we knew those values.

{The final answer is: We cannot determine the difference between their scores without the given information.}</s>","For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.
For collecting berries, Emma earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 fewer points than Ava.
For finishing the level faster, Emma earns 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 more points than Ava.
Overall, Emma has 120 – 80 - 15 = <<120-80-15=25>>25 more points than Ava.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of rides on usual days.
Each usual day, they ride their bikes twice. So, the number of rides on usual days is 2 rides/day * number of usual days.

Step 2: Calculate the number of rides on workdays.
On workdays, they ride their bikes thrice. So, the number of rides on workdays is 3 rides/day * number of workdays.

Step 3: Add the number of rides on workdays and usual days to find the total number of rides.
Total rides/week = Rides on workdays + Rides on usual days

First, let's find the number of workdays, as we know that they ride thrice a day for 5 days and twice a day for two other days. Since they ride thrice a day for 5 days, that makes 15 rides (3 rides/day * 5 days). If they ride twice a day for 2 days, that makes a total of 4 rides (2 rides/day * 2 days). Since the total number of rides in a week is 14 times the number of days in a week, we can calculate the number of usual days: 14 rides (total on 2 regular days) - 15 rides (total on workdays) = -1 ride. However, this doesn't make sense because we cannot have a negative number of days. This mistake indicates that we made an incorrect assumption. In fact, the correct number of rides on usual days is 8 (2 rides/day * 4 days).

Now, the number of rides on workdays is 15, and the number of rides on usual days is 8. So, the total number of rides is:

Total rides/week = 15 (rides on workdays) + 8 (rides on usual days) = 23 rides/week

The final answer is: {Chase and Rider ride their bikes a total of 23 times in a week.}</s>","Each person rides his bike 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 times for 5 days.
Together, they ride 15+15 = <<15+15=30>>30 times for five days.
Each person rides his bike 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 times for every day of the other two days.
This means each person rides 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 times on each day of the other two days.
The total for the other two days is 12+12 = <<12+12=24>>24
For the whole week the together ride 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 times

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.
2. Bob went to the pet store and bought some more fish, making the total number of fish in his pond double in number.
3. Let x be the number of white fish Bob initially had, and y be the number of white fish he bought at the store.
4. We know that x + y = 2(x + 3) because there were initially x white fish and y new white fish brought home.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get x + y = 2x + 6.
6. Subtracting x from both sides, we have y = x + 6.
7. Since there were initially more orange fish than white fish (3 > 4), and Bob wanted to have an equal number of both, he must have bought more white fish than orange fish.
8. Also, since the number of fish Bob bought from the store added to the initial number of fish would result in a total that's twice the initial number, and since he had fewer white fish than orange fish initially, he must have bought more than 3 white fish.

From the given information, it's not possible to determine the exact number of white fish Bob initially had, but we can find the number of white fish he bought at the store by using one of the given values as a starting point. For example, if we assume there were initially 4 white fish, we can calculate the number of white fish purchased as:

y = x + 6 -> y = 4 + 6 -> y = 10

Thus, one possible solution is that Bob bought 10 white fish at the store.

However, if we assume there were initially 5 white fish, the number of white fish purchased would be:
y = x + 6 -> y = 5 + 6 -> y = 11

Thus, another possible solution is that Bob bought 11 white fish at the store. Since the problem doesn't provide specific information on the exact number of white fish in the initial pond, multiple solutions are possible.

Final answer: {Bob bought either 10 or 11 white fish at the store}</s>","Bob started with 7 fish and bought seventeen, so he had 7 + 17 = <<7+17=24>>24 fish.
Let x = the number of white fish.
Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so 2*x + x = 24 fish
3*x = 24
x = 24/3 = <<24/3=8>>8 white fish.
Bob started with 4 white fish, so he bought 8 - 4 = 4 white fish at the store.

Gallons needed = Distance ÷ Fuel efficiency
 Gallons needed = 5 miles ÷ 10 miles per gallon
 Gallons needed = 0.5 gallons

Step 2: Calculate how many gallons are used for a round-trip commute every weekday.
 Gallons used per weekday = Gallons needed per trip × 2 (for both ways)
 Gallons used per weekday = 0.5 gallons × 2
 Gallons used per weekday = 1 gallon

Step 3: Determine how many gallons are used in a week for commuting.
 Gallons used per week = Gallons used per weekday × 5 (weekdays)
 Gallons used per week = 1 gallon × 5
 Gallons used per week = 5 gallons

Step 4: Calculate the cost of gas per week based on the given price.

First, we know Carrie has 10 twenties, and each twenty-dollar bill is worth $20. So she has:

$10 * $20 = $<<10*20=200>>200 in twenties.

Next, she has 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25. So she has:

$140 * $0.25 = $<<140*0.25=35>>35 in quarters.

To find out how much of the twenties and quarters she spent, we're told she spent 3/5 of the twenties and all of the quarters.

Spending 3/5 of the twenties means spending:

$20 * 3/5 = $<<20*3/5=120>>120.

That leaves $20 - $120 = $<<20-120=-100>>-100 of twenties that she didn't spend (note that this number is negative because it represents an amount of money that hasn't been spent). This is not possible, so there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement.

That means, three-eighths of their sales are OLED TVs.

Given that they sold a total of 40 TVs, the number of OLED TVs sold can be found by multiplying the total number of TVs by the fraction of sales represented by OLED TVs:

Number of OLED TVs = Total number of TVs * Fraction of total sales represented by OLED TVs

                    question:
                    Carson lives ! in an old house where the pipes . will freeze if ? the ? temperature ? inside the . house falls below 32 degrees. Every log ? of ! wood Carson burns heats the house up by 5 . degrees. If it was 45 ! degrees ; during the day, and it's . 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the ? day, how many logs ; does Carson need ! to ! burn to prevent the . pipes : from freezing?
                 [/INST] To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we need to determine how cold it gets at night and how long he needs to keep the house above the freezing point.

Given information:
- The daytime temperature is 45 degrees.
- It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day.

First, find the nighttime temperature:
Night temperature = Day temperature - 33
Night temperature = 45 - 33
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to maintain a temperature above 32 degrees at night. We'll find out how many degrees he needs to raise the temperature by calculating the difference between the desired night temperature and the current night temperature:

Desired night temperature = 32 degrees
Difference in temperature = Desired night temperature - Night temperature
Difference in temperature = 32 - 12
Difference in temperature = 20 degrees

Now, we know that every log burns heats the house up by 5 degrees. So, to heat the house up by 20 degrees, Carson needs to burn:

Logs required = Desired difference in temperature / Degrees heated per log
Logs required = 20 degrees / 5 degrees
Logs required = 4 logs

{The final answer is: Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.}</s>","First find the night-time temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees
Then find how much Carson needs to heat his house to avoid the pipes freezing: 32 degrees - 12 degrees = <<32-12=20>>20 degrees
Then divide the amount of heat Carson needs by the amount of heat each log produces: 20 degrees / 5 degrees/log = <<20/5=4>>4 logs

To break people up into smaller groups with : different leaders, 9-person groups were formed. If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each, how many seashells did they bring?
                 [/INST] To find out how many seashells were brought back, we first need to determine how many groups were formed and how many seashells each group brought back.

1. Number of groups: Since each group had 9 people and 3/5 of the groups had leaders, we need to find the number of standard groups (9-person groups), and then add the number of leader groups:

    Standard groups: 90 people / 9 = 10 groups
    Leader groups: 10 groups * (5/3) = 16.67 groups (rounding up to 17 since you can't have a fraction of a group)
    Total groups: 10 + 17 = 27 groups

2. Seashells per group: Since 3/5 of the groups had leaders, that means 2/5 of the groups didn't have leaders:

    Leader groups: 1/3 * 27 = 9 groups with leaders
    Standard groups: 2/3 * 27 = 18 groups without leaders
    Seashells for a standard group: 9 people/group * 2 seashells/person = 18 seashells/group

3. Total seashells:

    Seashells from standard groups: 18 seashells/group * 18 groups = 324 seashells
    Seashells from leader groups: 9 people/group * 2 seashells/person * 9 leader groups = 162 seashells
    Total seashells: 324 + 162 = 486 seashells

{The final answer is: 486 seashells}.</s>","Since the total number of people at the competition was 90, they formed 90/9=<<90/9=10>>10 groups after splitting into 9-person groups.
If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bringing back 2 seashells each, then 3/5*10=<<3/5*10=6>>6 groups had members bringing back 2 seashells.
Since each group had 9 people, the number of people in the 6 groups, who found 2 seashells each, was 6*9= <<6*9=54>>54.
The total number of seashells the 54 people brought is 54*2=<<54*2=108>>108 seashells.

Since the company hires 20 new employees every month, after three months, the total number of employees would be:
initial employee number + (hires per month * number of months)

= $1,040,000

Step 3: Calculate the total salary expense for three months.
To find the total salary expense for three months, multiply the monthly salary expense by the number of months:

In the second month, 20 more workers are hired, bringing the total number of employees to 220 employees + 20 employees = 240 employees
The company pays a total of 240 employees * $4000/employee = $<<240*4000=960000>>960000 in wages for its employees in the second month.

Step 4: Calculate Sally's hourly wage based on Billy's starting salary (which is $0.50 less than Sally's):
- Sally's hourly wage = Billy's starting wage + $0.50 = $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour

Step 5: Calculate Sally's monthly earnings:
- Sally's monthly earnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked per month = $10.50/hour * 80 hours/month = $840/month

Step 6: Calculate the difference in their monthly earnings:
- Difference in monthly earnings = Billy's monthly earnings - Sally's monthly earnings = $920/month - $840/month = $80/month

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of students in the school.
Number of students per class = 25
Total number of classes = 40
Total number of students = Number of students per class * Total number of classes = 25 * 40 = 1000

Step 2: Calculate the number of trees planted by students.
Number of trees planted by students = Number of students * 1 tree per student = 1000 * 1 = 1000

Step 3: Calculate the number of trees planted by teachers.
Number of teachers per class = 3
Number of trees planted by teachers in one class = Number of teachers * Trees per teacher = 3 * 2 = 6
Total number of teachers in the school = Number of teachers per class * Total number of classes = 3 * 40 = 120
Total number of trees planted by teachers = Number of teachers * Trees per teacher per class * Total number of classes = 120 * 6 = 720

Step 4: Calculate the total number of trees planted during the campaign.
Total number of trees = Number of trees planted by students + Number of trees planted by teachers = 1000 + 720 = 1720

{The final answer is: They will have planted 1720 trees at the end of the campaign.}</s>","40 classes participate in the campaign, representing a total of 40 * 25 = <<40*25=1000>>1000 students.
With 3 teachers per class, 40 * 3 = <<40*3=120>>120 teachers participate.
With one tree planted per student, 1000 * 1 = <<1000*1=1000>>1000 trees are planted per student.
With 2 trees planted per teacher, 120 * 2 = <<120*2=240>>240 trees are planted per teacher.
Adding the trees planted by teachers and students, 1000 + 240 = <<1000+240=1240>>1240 trees will have been planted at the end of the campaign.

                 [/INST] To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, such that 30% of all her stuffed animals are goats, follow these steps:

1. Find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles has:
Total stuffed animals = number of puppies + number of koalas + number of zebras + number of frogs
Total stuffed animals = 3(puppies) + 5(koalas) + 2(zebras) + 4(frogs)
Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5+ 2+ 4 = 14

2. Calculate how many stuffed goats she should have if 30% of her stuffed animals should be goats:
Number of stuffed goats = 0.30 * Total stuffed animals
Number of stuffed goats = 0.30 * 14
Number of stuffed goats = 4.2
Since we cannot have a fraction of a stuffed animal, we will need to round up to ensure we reach the desired percentage.
So, she should buy 5 stuffed goats to reach 30% of her collection being goats.

{The final answer is: She should buy 5 stuffed goats}</s>","Let x = the number of stuffed goats.
The current number of stuffed animals are (puppies + koalas + zebras + frogs) or 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = <<3+5+2+4=14>>14 stuffed animals total.

Cross multiply to get x = 0.42 + .3x
Subtract .3 x from each side, .7x = 0.42
Bubbles needs x = <<6=6>>6 goats added.

                 [/INST] To find out how many hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. First, let's find out how many hours Kris plays during half an hour every day: 0.5 hours/day * 7 days/week * 2 weeks = 7 days/week * 0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 * 0.5 * 14 = 7 x 7 = 49 hours in 2 weeks.

2. Next, let's find out how many hours Kris plays during 2 hours every day for 1 week: 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week * 4 weeks = 14 * 4 = 56 hours in 1 week.

3. So far, Kris has played 49 hours in 2 weeks and 56 hours in 1 week, which is a total of 105 hours. To find out how many hours more she needs to play, let's subtract this number from the needed 30 hours achievement: 30 hours - 105 hours = -75 hours.

4. Since it's impossible to have a negative number of hours to play, this means that Kris has exceeded the required 30 hours achievement.

Therefore, {Kris does not need to play any additional hours to earn the achievement}. In fact, she has already surpassed the achievement by 75 hours.</s>","Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.
So playing for half an hour every day means Kris will have played for 0.5 hours * 14 days = <<0.5*14=7>>7 hours.
Playing for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.
She therefore still needs to play 30 – 7 – 14 = <<30-7-14=9>>9 hours.

                    Two cars are driving on a highway.  The first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour when ! the second car passes it at an average speed of 70 miles per hour. ,  If . both ? cars continue on the highway at the : same speed, how many miles will separate them after 2 hours?
                 [/INST] To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to use the formula for distance: distance = speed * time.

First, we need to find the distance traveled by each car during the time the second car was passing the first car.

Let's call the time it takes for the second car to pass the first car ""t"". We're given that both cars continue at the same speed after the passing event. Therefore,:

First car speed: 60 mph
Second car speed: 70 mph

When the second car passes the first car:
1. The first car is traveling at a speed of 60 mph
2. The second car is traveling at a speed of 70 mph
3. The second car overtakes the first car
4. After passing, both cars travel at the same speed

Given that the first car's speed is 60 mph and the second car's speed is 70 mph when it passes the first car, there's a difference in their speeds of 10 mph during the passing event. Let's determine the time it takes for the second car to pass the first car.

We can use the concept of relative speed to find the duration of the passing event:

Relative speed = (first car speed + second car speed) / 2

Relative speed = (60 mph + 70 mph) / 2

Relative speed = 130 mph / 2

Relative speed = 65 mph

Now, to find the time ""t"" it takes for the second car to pass the first car, we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

In this case, the distance involved is the distance between the rear of the first car and the front of the second car when the passing event occurs. Since we don't have that information, we can't directly calculate ""t"". However, after ""t"" seconds, the cars will be a certain distance apart, and after 2 hours (7200 seconds), they will have traveled an additional 60 miles (first car) and 70 miles (second car) since they have the same speed.

Therefore, we cannot determine the exact distance between the cars after 2 hours because we don't have enough information about the passing event.

The final answer is: Insufficient information to provide an answer.</s>","In two hours, the first car will have traveled 60*2 = <<60*2=120>>120 miles.
Similarly, the second car will have traveled 70*2 = <<70*2=140>>140 miles.
Thus, the cars are separated by 140 - 120 = <<140-120=20>>20 miles after two hours.

   Cost of diamond = $600
   Cost of gold = $300
   The total cost of the diamond and gold = $600 + $300 = $900

Step 2: Calculate the premium amount by multiplying the cost of the ring without the premium by 30%.
   Premium = Cost of ring without premium * 30%
   Premium = $900 * 0.3 = $2700

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the ring by adding the cost of the ring without premium to the premium amount.

                 [/INST] To find the school's overall pass rate, we first need to find the number of passing students in each grade and then calculate the pass rate for each grade.

1. Passing third-graders: 340 out of 500
Pass rate for third-graders = (Number of passing students) / (Total number of students)
Pass rate for third-graders = 340 / 500 = 0.68

2. Passing fourth-graders: 40 out of 100
Pass rate for fourth-graders = (Number of passing students) / (Total number of students)
Pass rate for fourth-graders = 40 / 100 = 0.4

3. Passing fifth-graders: 400, given they passed at a rate twice that of the fourth-graders
Pass rate for fifth-graders = 0.4 * 2 = 0.8

Now, to find the overall pass rate, we need to find the total number of passing students and divide by the total number of students in the school. First, let's find the total number of passing students.

Total number of passing students = Passing third-graders + Passing fourth-graders + Passing fifth-graders
Total number of passing students = 340 + 40 + 400 = 780

Now, let's find the total number of students in the school: 500 third-graders + 100 fourth-graders + 400 fifth-graders = 1,000 students

Finally, to find the overall pass rate, divide the total number of passing students by the total number of students:

Overall pass rate = (Total number of passing students) / (Total number of students)
Overall pass rate = 780 / 1,000

Simplify the fraction:

Overall pass rate = 39%

{The final answer is 39%}</s>","First find the pass rate for the fourth graders: 40 students / 100 students = <<40/100=.4>>.4
Then double that to find the pass rate for the fifth graders: .4 * 2 = <<.4*2=.8>>.8
Then multiply the fifth graders' pass rate by the number of fifth graders to find the total number of fifth graders who passed: .8 * 400 fifth graders = <<.8*400=320>>320 fifth graders
Now add up the number of passing students from each grade to find to find the total number of passing students: 320 students + 40 students + 340 students = <<320+40+340=700>>700 students
Add up the total number of students in each grade to find the total number of students: 400 students + 100 students + 500 students = <<400+100+500=1000>>1000 students

Step 2: Calculate how many glass chips are in one bag.
- We know that one bag has 72 chips.

Step 3: Determine how many chips Milo has in total.
- Since Milo has two bags, he has 2 * 72 = <um>144</um> chips in total.

Step 4: Find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with his total number of chips.
- Milo can make square inches of mosaic with his chips, So the area of Milo's mosaic is square inches.

Step 5: Determine the height and width of Milo's mosaic to find its length.
- Given that Milo's mosaic is three inches tall, and its area is square inches, we can find its width by taking the square root of its area and dividing it by 2: width = √(area) / 2
- Since the area is square inches, this calculation results in width inches.
- The length of Milo's mosaic is then the product of its height (3 inches) and width (width inches): length = height * width = 3 inches * width

The final answer is: length = 3 inches * width inches. To find the actual length in inches, calculate the square root of the area and divide it by 2: length = 3 inches * (√(square inches) / 2)</s>","Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.
With those, he can make 144 / 12 = <<144/12=12>>12 square inches of mosaic.
Thus, Milo can make his 3 inch tall mosaic 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.

2. 16 students each drank 2 quarts, so they consumed a total of 16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts.
3. The total amount of tea consumed by the students is 6 quarts (from 4 students) + 32 quarts (from 16 students) = 38 quarts.
4. We are given that there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students finished drinking, so the total amount of tea at the party was 38 quarts (consumed by students) + 10 quarts (left at the end) = 48 quarts.
5. To find the number of gallons of tea at the beginning of the party, we divide the total amount of tea (in quarts) by 4 (since there are 4 quarts in 1 gallon).So {The final answer is the total amount of tea (48 quarts) divided by 4 (quarts in a gallon) = 12 gallons}

As she's carrying these flowers , over ; to fill the ! vase, she drops 1 of each and the . wind blows them ; away. ?  She puts the remaining flowers in ; the vase. .  How many petals ! in : total are on the flowers in the vase?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's calculate the number of petals for each type of flower that Rose put in the vase.
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Step 2: Since Rose dropped one of each type of flower, we need to subtract the number of petals from one flower of each type.
- One flower with 5 petals: 1 * 5 = 5 petals
- One flower with 6 petals: 1 * 6 = 6 petals
- One flower with 4 petals: 1 * 4 = 4 petals
- One flower with 7 petals: 1 * 7 = 7 petals

Step 3: The number of petals in the dropped flowers is 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals.

Step 4: Subtract the petals from the dropped flowers from the total number of petals that Rose put in the vase.
- Total number of petals in the vase: 15 + 24+ 20+ 42 - 5- 6- 4- 7 = 105 petals

The final answer is: There are 105 petals in total on the flowers in the vase.</s>","Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.
Finally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.
Rose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.
But the wind blows 5+6+4+7=<<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals worth of flowers away.
So Rose has 101-22=<<101-22=79>>79 petals worth remaining

So, they used 18 marshmallows (1 marshmallow per S'more).

Step 2: They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so those aren't available for making S'mores.
So, they used a total of 21 marshmallows (18 for S'mores and 3 that were dropped).

Step 3: The original bag had 35 marshmallows. After using 21, there are 14 marshmallows left in the bag.

{The final answer is: Each kid can have an additional 7 S'mores (14 marshmallows / 2 = 7 S'mores).}</s>","They used up 21 marshmallows because 9 plus 9 plus 3 equals <<9+9+3=21>>21.

                    A new arcade opens ; up and ? Jack decides to play with ! his 3 friends. ?  Jack can play ! a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes.  ! Two of his friends . are significantly worse than ? him and . can only play half as long. !  One of them is significantly better and can ? play for 1.5 times as : long.  They play for 4 hours.  How , much ! money is used?
                 [/INST] To find out how much money is used, we first need to determine how long each friend plays.

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
2. Two friends are significantly worse and can play half as long as Jack. So each of them plays for 20 minutes / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 minutes.
3. One friend is significantly better and can play 1.5 times as long as Jack. So they play for 20 minutes*1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 minutes.
4. They play for a total of 4 hours*60 minutes = <<4*60=240>>240 minutes.

Now we find out how many quarters are needed for each of them:

1. Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes*1 quarter = <<240/20=12>>12 quarters.
2. Two friends: 12*10 minutes = 120 minutes, so 120 minutes / 10 minutes*1 quarter = <<120/10=12>>12 quarters each.
3. The better friend: 12*30 minutes = 360 minutes, or 1 hour*60 minutes + 30 minutes = 1 hour 30 minutes, so the cost for this friend depends on how the arcade accepts payments. If they use quarters, it might be possible to split the payment into 6 quarters for 1 hour and 3 extra quarters for 30 minutes, or they might need to buy an additional hour or an additional half hour, resulting in 13 or 14 quarters.

Assuming the arcade doesn't offer such fractional hour or half-hour payments, the friend would need to buy at least 2 additional hours (for a total of 4 hours) = 4*60 minutes = <<4*60=240>>240 minutes / 20 minutes = <<240/20=12>>12 quarters.

{The final answer is 12 + 12 + 12 = <<12+12+12=36>>36 quarters.}</s>","Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour

                 [/INST] Let's denote the amount of each ingredient that Tanya uses to fill one 10-ounce jar. We're given the following relationships:

1. The amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance. Let's denote this as `x` ounces.
2. The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest (or fragrance), which is `2x` ounces.
3. Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, which is `2 * 2x = 4x` ounces.
4. She also uses twice as much salt as zest, which is `2x` ounces, and the same amount of salt as sugar. Since we don't know the amount of sugar, we cannot find the exact amount of oil in terms of `x` alone. However, we can find the ratio between oil and salt and zest.

From the given information, we've determined that:
- Salt to citrus zest (or fragrance): 1:1
- Salt to oil: 1:4
- Salt to zest: 1:0.5

We cannot determine the exact amount of oil that Tanya uses without additional information, such as the amount of sugar in the recipe. However, we have determined the ratios of each ingredient to one another.

Since we cannot find the exact amount of oil, the final answer is: {The final answer is undefined without the amount of sugar in the recipe.}</s>","Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.
Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.
She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.
In all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.
Thus, she uses Z = 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1 ounce of zest.
Thus, Tanya uses 4Z = <<4=4>>4 ounces of oil.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step:

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. If Robert has 20 cars, then Joe has 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 cars.
2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. So, Joes sold cars = 40 * 0.2 = <<40*0.2=8>>8 cars.
3. Joe gives away twice as many cars to his mother as the number he sold to her. Joe gave to his mother = 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 cars.
4. Now, let's find out how many cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother.
   Joe Remaining Cars = Cars before Sell - Sold Cars + Cars Given Away
   = 40 - 8 + 16

Therefore, {The final answer is 44}.</s>","If Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has 2*20 = 40 cars.

Now that we know the students raised a total of $125,000, we can determine how much each student raised by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students.

Amount raised by each student = Total amount raised by students / Number of students

Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

Step 2: Calculate the number of hours Sandy walked on the second day.
She walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day, so:
Hours on the second day = Half of hours on the first day
Hours on the second day = (1/2) * 8 hours
Hours on the second day = 4 hours

Step 3: Convert the number of hours from each day to minutes.
We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour:
Minutes on the first day = Hours on the first day * 60 minutes per hour
Minutes on the first day = 8 hours * 60 minutes
Minutes on the first day = 480 minutes

Minutes on the second day = Hours on the second day * 60 minutes per hour
Minutes on the second day = 4 hours * 60 minutes
Minutes on the second day = 240 minutes

Step 3: We want to find the total number of points Sasha scored in both games. So, we have:

Total points for Sasha = Points in first game + Points in second game

Step 4: From the information given, we know that:

- In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points and Julie scored 10 points.
- In the second game, Julie scored X points and Sasha scored X - 6 points.

Step 5: We can set up an equation to find the total number of points Sasha scored:

14 (Sasha's points in game 1) + (X - 6) (Sasha's points in game 2) = Total points

Step 6: To solve for the total points, we can substitute the known values of Sasha's points in game 1 into the equation:

14 + (X - 6) = Total points

Step 7: To find the total points, we can solve for X:

X - 6 + 14 = Total points
X = Total points + 8

Step 8: Unfortunately, the problem does not provide enough information to find the value of Total points. We would need to know the total number of points scored by both teams in one of the games or the difference in points between the two teams in one of the games in order to find the total points score for Sasha.

Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of total points Sasha scored during both games based on the given information. {The final answer is uncertain without further information}.</s>","In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points, and Julie scored four fewer points: 14-4 = <<14-4=10>>10 points.
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 points fewer than Julie's score in the first game, meaning she scored 10-6=<<10-6=4>>4 points.
Sasha scored 10+4=<<10+4=14>>14 points in the two games.

                 [/INST] Let's go through the given problem step-by-step:

1. We know that Becca has a collection of Magic Cards, and the total number of cards for Becca, Smendrick, and PJ is 341.
2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so the number of cards Smendrick has is: Card_Smendrick = Card_Becca - 12
3. Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has, so the number of cards PJ has is: Card_PJ = Card_Smendrick / 3
4. Now we have the number of cards for PJ, so let's find the number of cards for Smendrick: Card_Smendrick = Card_Becca - 12 = 3 * Card_PJ
5. Since the total number of cards for Becca, Smendrick, and PJ is 341, we can represent this relationship in an equation: Card_Becca + Card_Smendrick + Card_PJ = 341

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1. Card_Smendrick = Card_Becca - 12
2. Card_Smendrick = 3 * Card_PJ

Let's solve this system of equations.

First, we'll eliminate Card_Smendrick by substituting the first equation into the second:

Card_Becca - 12 = 3 * Card_PJ

Now, let's solve for Card_PJ:

Card_PJ = (Card_Becca - 12) / 3

Next, we'll solve the system using the equation for Card_Becca and the expression for Card_PJ:

Card_Becca + Card_Becca / 3 + (Card_Becca - 12) / 3 = 341

Combine the terms with Card_Becca:

Card_Becca (1 + 1/3) + Card_Becca / 3 - 12 / 3 = 341

We can write this equation in a simpler form:

Card_Becca (4/3) + Card_Becca / 3 - 12 = 341

Now, we have to find a solution for Card_Becca. We'll start by finding the value of the term with Card_Becca:

Card_Becca (4/3 + 1/3) = 341 - (12 / 3)

Card_Becca (5/3) = 339

Card_Becca = 339 * (3/5)

Card_Becca = 203.4

The number of cards cannot be a decimal, so there seems to be a mistake in the problem. The given information doesn't allow us to find a whole number for the number of cards Becca has.

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. So, the number of blue eggs is 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs. So, the number of pink eggs is 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. So, the number of yellow eggs is (1/3) * 9 = 3 pink eggs.

Therefore, Cindy had a total of 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 21 eggs.

Step 3: Determine the total loss - Shipping cost + (Book cost - Refund amount)

1. The firm charges a base fee of $129.00 for installing 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.
2. They charge an additional $15.00 per item for installing extra items.

For Angela's items, we have:
- 6 mirrors (instead of 4)
- 2 chandeliers (instead of 1)
- 20 pictures (instead of 10)

Now let's calculate the cost for each type of item:

Cost for mirrors: (number of mirrors - initial number) * (cost per extra mirror) = (6 - 4) * $15 = 2 * $15 = $30
Cost for chandeliers: (number of chandeliers - initial number) * (cost per extra chandelier) = (2 - 1) * $15 = 1 * $15 = $15
Cost for pictures: (number of pictures - initial number) * (cost per extra picture) = (20 - 10) * $15 = 10 * $15 = $150

The total cost for Angela is the base fee plus the costs for the additional items:

1. First, let's determine how high a mountain Saskay can lift, which is 12 times higher than the mountain Pompei can lift (1 inch). Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain that is 12 inches high.

2. Next, we need to find out how high a mountain Kagiyami can lift, which is 4 times higher than the mountain Saskay can lift (12 inches). So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain that is 12 x 4 = 48 inches high.

3. Finally, we need to find out how high a mountain Naruto can lift, which is ten times higher than the mountain Kagiyami can lift (48 inches). Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain that is 48 x 10 = 480 inches high.

4. We need to convert inches to feet. We know that 1 inch equals 1 foot, so the height in inches is equal to the height in feet. However, since the problem asks for the answer in feet, we will keep the units consistent throughout our calculation. So, the height that Naruto can lift is 480 inches = 480 feet.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the distance Mason traveled during the first leg of his journey.
The distance traveled is the product of the speed and the time.
Distance_1 = Speed * Time
Distance_1 = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance_1 = 32 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance Mason traveled during the second leg of his journey.
Distance_2 = Speed * Time
Distance_2 = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours
Distance_2 = 48 miles

Step 3: Add the distances from both legs to get the total distance traveled by Mason.
Total Distance = Distance_1 + Distance_2
Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total Distance = 80 miles

The final answer is: {Mason traveled a total of 80 miles}.</s>","If Mason travels for 8 miles in one hour, in four hours, he traveled for 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 miles.

                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how long it takes one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours in total, we can calculate the time it takes for one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos:

Time for one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Time for one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours

Now that we know it takes one kangaroo 6 hours to travel across the highway, we can find out how long it takes one turtle to make the same journey. A turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, we'll need to divide the time it takes for one kangaroo by 2 to find the time it takes for one turtle:

Time for one turtle = Time for one kangaroo / 2
Time for one turtle = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Finally, to find out how long it takes four turtles to travel across the highway, we can find the total time by multiplying the time it takes for one turtle by the number of turtles:

Total time for four turtles = Time for one turtle * Number of turtles
Total time for four turtles = 3 hours * 4 turtles = 12 hours

So, the answer to the question is:

{The final answer is: It takes 12 hours for four turtles to travel across the highway.}</s>","If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed, a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, one kangaroo takes 18/3= <<18/3=6>>6 hours to cross the highway.

                 [/INST] Let's start by finding out how many clay dishes Rory makes. We know that Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so let's call the number of dishes Rory makes ""r"". Then, Jada makes 2r dishes. We also know that Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so let's call the number of dishes Kora makes ""k"". Therefore:

r + 2r = 2(r + k)
3r = 2r + 2k
r = 2k

Substituting the value of r from the above equation, we get:

k = Rory's dishes
r = 2k

So, Rory makes k clay dishes. We also know that Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Kora makes k - 20 dishes.

Now, let's find out how many dishes Jada makes:

Jada's dishes = 2 * Rory's dishes = 2 * k

Therefore, Jada makes 2k dishes.

To find out the total number of dishes they all make together, we simply add the number of dishes each of them makes:

Total dishes = Jada's dishes + Rory's dishes + Kora's dishes
Total dishes = 2k + k + (k - 20)
Total dishes = 3k - 20

{The final answer is 3k - 20 dishes}. However, since we don't know the value of k, we can't provide a specific number for the total number of dishes they make together. We need more information to find that out.</s>","If Kora made 20 clay dishes, Rory made 20 clay dishes + 20 clay dishes = <<20+20=40>>40 clay dishes.
Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory, which totals 2 * 40 clay dishes = <<2*40=80>>80 clay dishes.
The total number of clay dishes made by the three is 80 from Jada + 40 from Rory + 20 from Kora = <<80+40+20=140>>140 clay dishes

1. The laptop costs $600.
2. Trading in her old laptop reduces the price by $200.
3. So, the amount Erika has to pay for the new laptop is $600 - $200 = $400.
4. She has some savings in her purse, which are increased by $150 from her part-time job this week and an additional $80 from her mom.
5. Therefore, the total amount of money Erika has in her purse is $400 (for the new laptop) + $150 (money from her part-time job) + $80 (money from her mom) = $630.

3 large apples * 5 slices per apple = 15 slices from large apples

Step 2: Find the number of slices from small apples.
5 small apples * 3 slices per apple = 15 slices from small apples

Step 3: Determine the total number of slices consumed by Adam.
15 slices from large apples + 15 slices from small apples = 30 slices consumed by Adam

Step 4: Find the number of slices left by subtracting the consumed slices from the total number of slices obtained.
Total number of slices = slices from large apples + slices from small apples
Total number of slices = 15 slices from large apples + 15 slices from small apples = 30 slices

Number of slices left = Total number of slices - Consumed slices
Number of slices left = 30 slices - 30 slices = {0 slices}

However, in the real world, it's unlikely that there would be no slices left after eating 15 slices each from 3 large and 5 small apples. It may be worth double-checking the calculation to ensure there is an error or inconsistency somewhere. For instance, there might be a small apple with only 2 slices instead of 3.

Milk produced by one cow = 5 ! liters

Step 2: Determine how many liters of milk are produced by the current three cows.
Milk produced by 3 cows = Milk produced by one cow * Number of cows
Milk produced by 3 cows = 5 ! liters * 3
Milk produced by 3 cows = 15 ! liters

Step 3: Find out how many more liters of milk the farmer needs to produce 25 liters more than what he's currently producing.
Liters of milk needed = Current milk production + 25 liters - Current milk production
Liters of milk needed = 15 ! liters + 25 liters - 15 ! liters
Liters of milk needed = 16 ! liters

Step 4: Find out how many more cows are needed to produce that amount of milk.
Number of cows needed = (Required milk production - Current milk production) / Milk production per cow
Number of cows needed = (16 ! liters - 15 ! liters) / 5 ! liters
Number of cows needed = 1.2 * (15 ! liters * 2) / 5 ! liters
Number of cows needed = 1.2 * 30 liters / 5 ! liters
Number of cows needed = 1.2 * 30 / 120
Number of cows needed = 0.5 * 3
Number of cows needed = 1.5

- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as the number of socks in the store.
- Jack collected 60 dishes.

Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as S, and the number of socks Peter has as 2S. Similarly, let N be the number of dishes Jack has, and D be the number of dishes Peter has.

From the given information, we have:
- Socks: S (Jack) -> 2S (Peter)
- Dishes: N (Jack) -> D (Peter)

We also know that Jack collected twice as many dishes as the number of socks in the store:
N = 2S

We don't have enough information to directly find the value of S, but since we know that Jack has 60 dishes and N = 2S, we can set up an equation:

2S = 60
S = 30

Now that we have the value of S, we can find the value of D:

D = 2S
D = 2 * 30
D = 60

Therefore, Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes, making a total of 90 items. Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, Peter has 60 socks as well. Thus, the total number of items they both have is:

{Total number of items: 60 (Peter's socks) + 60 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) = 180}

However, the problem states that Jack collected twice as many dishes as the number of socks in the store, but we didn't use that information yet. Since the number of socks in the store is S, we have:

N = 2S = 2 * 30 = 60

This means that Peter also has 60 dishes. So the final answer is:

                    Vicki is planning , a : pop concert at her ; high school. The show will be 2 ! hours. She is allowing each group 2 minutes ? to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and then 2 ? minutes to exit the stage. If ! she , allows a 10-minute intermission, ! how ; many groups can perform in the concert?
                 [/INST] To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we first need to calculate the total time available for groups to perform on stage.

1. The concert lasts for 2 hours.
2. Each group is given a total of 8 minutes (2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit) for each performance.

Now let's find out how many minutes are available in total for performances:

Total minutes for performances = Total concert minutes - Intermission minutes
Total concert minutes = 2 hours * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Intermission minutes = 10 minutes

Total minutes for performances = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Now let's find out how many groups can perform with the given time:

Groups per hour = 60 minutes / 8 minutes per group = 7.5 groups per hour
However, since we can't have half a group, we can only have 7 groups perform per hour. With the 110 minutes available for performances, we can have:

Number of groups = Total minutes for performances / Minutes per group
Number of groups = 110 minutes / 8 minutes per group = 13.75 groups

Again, we can't have a fraction of a group, so we can only accommodate 13 groups in the concert.

{The final answer is: 13 groups can perform in the concert.}</s>","First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
Of those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 – 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances.
Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.
Of the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Identify the principal amount (P) and the annual interest rate (r).
P = $300
r = 0.75 * P (Since the interest is three-quarters of the principal per year)

Step 2: Use the simple interest formula to calculate the amount of interest (I) earned each year.
I = Prt
 where t is the time in years.

Step 3: Calculate the interest earned in the first year.
I = ($300) * (0.75) * (1)
I = $225

Step 4: Add the interest earned in the first year to the principal to find the principal amount after one year.
P_1 = P + I
P_1 = $300 + $225
P_1 = $525

Step 5: Calculate the interest earned in the second year.
I = ($525) * (0.75) * (1)
I = $386.875

Step 6: Add the interest earned in the second year to the principal to find the principal amount after two years.
P_2 = P_1 + I
P_2 = $525 + $386.875
P_2 = $911.875

Step 7: Calculate the interest earned in the third year.
I = ($911.875) * (0.75) * (1)
I = $643.3406

Step 8: Add the interest earned in the third year to the principal to find the principal amount after three years.
P_3 = P_2 + I
P_3 = $911.875 + $643.3406
P_3 = $1555.2162

- We know that half of the white shirts have collars.
- So, we need to find the number of white shirts without collars.
- The total number of white shirts is 40.
- Half of them have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20.
- Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

Step 2: Determine the number of floral shirts with no buttons.
- We know that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.
- So, we need to find the number of floral shirts without buttons.
- The total number of floral shirts is 50.
- The number of floral shirts with buttons is 20, so the number of floral shirts without buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Step 3: Compare the number of white shirts with no collars to the number of floral shirts with no buttons.
- White shirts with no collars: 20
- Floral shirts with no buttons: 30

Step 4: Determine the difference between the two numbers.

1. The farmer has 900 eggs.
2. He places the eggs on trays, and each tray holds 30 eggs.
3. To find out how many trays he needs, we'll divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold: 900 eggs / 30 eggs/tray = 30 trays.
4. He sells each tray for $2.5.
5. To find out the farmer's total earnings, we need to multiply the number of trays he sold by the price per tray: 30 trays * $2.5/tray = $75.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of goats in each farm before the sale.
Farm X has 55 goats.
Farm Y has 45 goats.

Step 2: Determine the number of goats sold from Farm X. We know that 10 goats were sold.

Step 3: Determine the number of goats sold from Farm Y. We're told that ""twice as many goats"" were sold as from Farm X, so we need to find the number of goats that's twice the number of goats sold from Farm X.

10 goats were sold from Farm X, so...

Step 4: Find the number of goats sold from Farm Y.
Since Farm Y had twice as many goats sold as Farm X, then:
Goats sold from Farm Y = 2 * Goats sold from Farm X
= 2 * 10
= 20

Step 5: Subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in each farm to find the number of goats left.

For Farm X:
Initially had 55 goats, and 10 were sold, so now it has 55 - 10 = <<55-10=45>>45 goats.

For Farm Y:
Initially had 45 goats, and 20 were sold, so now it has 45 - 20 = <<45-20=25>>25 goats.

Step 6: Find the total number of goats remaining in both farms.
Total = Goats in Farm X + Goats in Farm Y
= 45 + 25
= <<45+25=70>>70

{The final answer is 70 goats}.</s>","There are 55 - 10 = <<55-10=45>>45 goats left in Farm X.
Mr. Smith sold 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 goats from Farm Y.
Thus, 45 - 20 = <<45-20=25>>25 goats are left in Farm Y.
Therefore, there are a total of 45 + 25 = <<45+25=70>>70 goats left in the two farms altogether.

1. We know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes per month, so in a year (which has 12 months), he buys:
2 pairs of shoes/month * 12 months/year = {12 * 2 = 24 pairs of shoes/year}

2. We also know that James spends $2640 per year on shoes. Therefore, the cost of each pair of shoes is:
$2640/year / 24 pairs/year = {($2640/24)}

Step 2: Calculate the discount for 3 baskets of red food.
Discount for red food = $2 * 3 = $6

Step 3: Subtract the discount from the cost of 3 baskets of red food.
Cost of 3 baskets of red food with discount = $54 - $6 = $48

Here are the steps:

1. The number of minutes it takes to clean one room is 20 minutes.
2. Therefore, the number of minutes it takes to clean all 90 rooms is: Minutes for all rooms = Number of rooms * Minutes per room = 90 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 1800 minutes.
3. To find the number of minutes it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we divide the total number of minutes by 2: Minutes for half of the rooms = Total minutes / 2 = 1800 minutes / 2 = 900 minutes.
4. Now, we need to convert the number of minutes to hours. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the number of minutes by 60: Hours for half of the rooms = Minutes for half of the rooms / Minutes per hour = 900 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 15 hours.

From the problem, we know:
1. z = brother's age - 3 (you are three years younger than your brother)
2. z = sister's age + 2 (you are 2 years older than your sister)
3. mother's age = 3 * brother's age - 1
4. Sum of all ages = 87

We have two equations for your age z. Let's solve for z using algebra:

z = x - 3
z = y + 2

We can't directly solve this system of equations, but we can find some relationships between the variables.

Since x > y (you are older than your sister), we have:

y + 2 < x - 3

Let's find the minimum value for the difference between your brother's and your sister's ages:

y = x - 5

Substitute this expression for y into the equation 3x - 1 = mother's age:

3x - 1 = 3 * (x - 5)
3x - 1 = 3x - 15
14 = 15 * (x - 5)
x - 5 = 1/15
x = 5 + (1/15)
x = 5 + 0.0667...
x ≈ 5.067

Since x is your brother's age and must be a whole number, we have an inconsistency in the problem. The given information doesn't allow for a unique solution.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of glue sticks each student will receive.
Mr. Jackson wants to give each student 2 glue sticks.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed for all students.
Number of students = 27
Glue sticks per student = 2
Total glue sticks = Number of students * Glue sticks per student
Total glue sticks = 27 * 2 = 54

Step 3: Determine how many glue sticks come in each pack.
Glue sticks per pack = 8

Step 4: Calculate how many packs are needed to provide each student with 2 glue sticks.
Packs needed for 1 student = Glue sticks per student / Glue sticks per pack
Packs needed for 1 student = 2 / 8 = 0.25
Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he must buy 2 packs to give 1 student 2 glue sticks.

Step 5: Calculate how many packs are needed to provide each student with 2 glue sticks for the entire class.
Packs needed for all students = Packs needed for 1 student * Number of students
Packs needed for all students = 2 * 27 = 54
However, Mr. Jackson only needs to buy enough packs for 54 glue sticks, since he already has some extras.

Step 6: Determine how many extra glue sticks Mr. Jackson has.
Mr. Jackson has some extra glue sticks. Let's call the number of extra glue sticks x.
Total glue sticks = 54 * 8 (from purchasing packs for all students) + x
Total glue sticks = 432 + x
The number of glue sticks in a pack is 8, so 54 packs = 432.
Therefore, x = 54 * 8 - 432 = 112

Step 7: Check that the calculation is correct.
The total number of glue sticks Mr. Jackson bought is 54 packs * 8 glue sticks/pack = 432.
He gave each student 2 glue sticks, so he has 112 extra glue sticks. Therefore, the total number of glue sticks should be 432 + 112 = 544.

{The final answer is 55 packs}

However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he cannot buy exactly 55 packs. He will have to buy an additional pack for the 8 extra glue sticks, making the total number of packs 56. This means that Mr. Jackson can buy 56 packs and have 4 extra glue sticks. This is a close enough approximation, since the original problem only indicated that Mr. Jackson expects to have some extra glue sticks left over.

{The final answer is 56 packs}

(Note: Depending on the perspective of the problem, it might be more accurate to say that Mr. Jackson needs to buy 57 packs to have enough glue sticks for all students and have some leftover. However, this would go against the original problem statement, which only indicates that he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over. The final answer of 56 packs is a reasonable approximation based on the information provided in the problem statement.)</s>","Mr. Jackson will need 27 x 2 = <<27*2=54>>54 glue sticks.
Divide the number of glue sticks by the amount in each pack, 54 / 8 = <<54/8=6.75>>6.75 packs.
Since Mr. Jackson must buy whole packs, you must round 6.75 up to the next highest whole number, 7.
Mr. Jackson must buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We are given that the plague infects 10 people initially. Each infected person infects six others.

Step 2: After one day, the number of infected people will be the initial 10, plus the number of people newly infected by them. Each of the initial 10 infected people will infect 6 new people, so:

Newly infected people = Initial infected people * Infection rate
Newly infected people = 10 * 6
Newly infected people = 60

Total number of infected people after one day = Initial infected people + Newly infected people
Total number of infected people after one day = 10 + 60
Total number of infected people after one day = 70

Step 3: We want to find out how many people are infected after three days. Since the rate of infection stays the same each day, we can use similar calculations for each subsequent day:

Number of infected people after day 2 = Number of infected people after day 1 + Number of newly infected people after day 1
Number of infected people after day 2 = 70 + 60
Number of infected people after day 2 = 130

Number of infected people after day 3 = Number of infected people after day 2 + Number of newly infected people after day 2
Number of infected people after day 3 = 130 + 60
Number of infected people after day 3 = 190

Step 4: {The final answer is 190 people are infected after three days.}</s>","On the first day, the original ten people infect six people each, so 10 * 6 = <<10*6=60>>60 more people are infected.
There are 10 + 60 = <<10+60=70>>70 infected people after the first day.
On the second day, 70 * 6 = <<70*6=420>>420 more people are infected.
There are 70 + 420 = <<70+420=490>>490 infected people after the second day.

                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how much money Rafaela received in tips from the 40 customers. Since each customer gave her a $20 tip, we can find the total amount by multiplying the number of customers by the tip amount.

Tip amount for each customer = $20
Number of customers = 40

Total tips for Rafaela = Tip amount for each customer * Number of customers
Total tips for Rafaela = $20 * 40 = $800

 Next, we need to find out how much money Julieta received in tips. We know that she received 10% less money than Rafaela. So, we can find Julieta's tips by subtracting 10% of Rafaela's tips from her total tips.

Percentage of Julieta's tips compared to Rafaela's tips = 90%

Total tips for Julieta = Total tips for Rafaela * Percentage of Julieta's tips
Total tips for Julieta = $800 * 0.9 = $720

How many more badges does Wendy ? earn compared to Amber in a 1 ? year ! time frame?
                 [/INST] Steps for solving the problem:

1. Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month. So in one year (12 months), she earns:
   Badges earned by Claire in one year = Monthly badges earned * Number of months
   = 1 badge/month * 12 months
   = 12 badges

2. It takes Amber twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns:
   Monthly badges earned by Amber = Monthly badges earned by Claire / 2
   = 1 badge/month * (1/2) = 0.5 badges/month
   = 6 badges in one year (12 months * 0.5 badges/month)

3. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns:
   Badges earned by Wendy in one year = Badges earned by Claire in one year * 3
   = 12 badges/year * 3
   = 36 badges

4. To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a one-year time frame, subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
   Extra badges earned by Wendy = Badges earned by Wendy - Badges earned by Amber
   = 36 badges - 6 badges
   = 30 badges

{The final answer is: Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a one-year time frame.}</s>","Claire earns 1 badge every month so over 12 months she earns 1*12 = <<1*12=12>>12 badges
It takes Amber twice as long as Claire to earn a badge so over 1 year she earns 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 badges
Wendy earns 3 times the amount of badges compared to Claire who earns 12 badges so over 1 year Wendy earns 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 badges
Wendy earns 36 badges while Amber earns 6 so Wendy has earned 36-6 = <<36-6=30>>30 more badges

She bakes 2 loaves hourly, and she bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a span of 5 hours. So, she bakes 2 x 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 banana bread loaves.

Step 2: Determine the number of slices she can create from these loaves.
Each banana bread loaf makes 8 slices, so she has 10 x 8 = <<10*8=80>>80 slices in total.

Step 3: Determine how much revenue she generates from selling all these slices.
She sells each slice for $0.50, so her total revenue is 80 x $0.50 = $<<80*0.5=40>>40.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of silver coins as S. Then, the number of gold coins is S + 30.

We're given the information that Gretchen has 70 gold coins. So we can write an equation:

S + 30 = 70

Now, we need to find the total number of coins that Gretchen has. Since there are S silver coins and S + 30 gold coins, the total number of coins is:

Total Coins = S + (S + 30)

Substitute the equation from step 1 into this equation:

Total Coins = S + (S + 30)

Combine like terms:

Total Coins = 2S + 30

We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so we can find the number of silver coins by subtracting 30 from the number of gold coins:

S = Gold Coins - 30

Substitute this expression for S into the equation for Total Coins:

Total Coins = 2(Gold Coins - 30) + 30

Simplify the equation:

Total Coins = 2Gold Coins - 30 + 30

Total Coins = 2Gold Coins

Therefore, the total number of coins that Gretchen has is equal to the number of gold coins she has:

{The final answer is 2 × 70 = 140}

However, there seems to be a mistake in the problem or in our calculations. Since there's a 30-coin difference between the number of silver and gold coins, and there are 70 gold coins, it doesn't make sense that the total number of coins is only 140 (twice the number of gold coins) because we'd expect an additional 30 silver coins. Please double-check the problem to make sure there is no mistake.</s>","Gretchen has 70-30=<<70-30=40>>40 silver coins.

1. We have 12 red cars.
2. There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are 10 green cars (12 red cars - 2).
3. We have 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, so there are 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.
4. The total number of cars in the rink is 75.
5. We have determined that there are 12 red cars, 10 green cars, and 30 blue cars.
6. To find the number of yellow cars, we need to subtract the number of cars we know about (red, green, and blue) from the total number of cars.

First, let's find the number of green and blue cars:

12 red cars + 10 green cars + 30 blue cars = 52 cars

A = F - 12

We want to find out the number of books Fawn has. We can use the given relationships to create an equation in terms of F.

First, solve for A in terms of F:
A = F - 12

Next, substitute A with F-12 in the equation for S:
S = A + 25
S = (F-12) + 25

Now, we have S = F +13. We already have one equation with two variables; to find the value of F, we need a second equation. Since we have S = 85 and we've just found the relationship between S and F, we can write S = 85 as:

F + 13 = 85

To find F, we just need to subtract 13 from S (85) and then simplify:

Weight of bag of sweet potatoes = 2 * 5 pounds
Weight of bag of sweet potatoes = 10 pounds

Now we know that the weight of the bag of carrots is 3 pounds less than the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes.

Weight of bag of carrots = Weight of bag of sweet potatoes - 3 pounds

Each kid will have 4 jello cups, so the total number of jello cups needed is:
30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Step 2: Determine how many three-ounce boxes of jello are needed.
Since one box makes 10 small jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to make 120 jello cups. We'll do this by dividing the total number of jello cups needed by the number of jello cups that a single box makes, and then rounding up to the nearest whole number because we can't make a fraction of a box:
120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box ≈ 12 boxes
Since we can't buy a fraction of a box, we'll need to buy 13 boxes to ensure that we have enough for all 120 jello cups.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of jello.
We know that each box costs $1.25, so:

1. Madeline pays 60% of the total monthly cost, so her share is: $400 * 0.6 = $240.
2. Therefore, Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the total monthly cost: $400 * 0.4 = $160.
3. Since there are four weeks in a month, Keenan's weekly spending would be his monthly spending divided by the number of weeks: $160 / 4 = $40 per week.

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day:
1. He ate 2/5 of the pizza on the first day.
2. So, the number of pieces he ate on the first day is (1/2) * (total number of pieces): (1/2) * 60 = 30 pieces

Next, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the second day:
1. He ate 10 pieces on the second day.

To find out how many pieces are left after eating on the first and second days, we subtract the number of pieces eaten from the total number of pieces:
Total pieces - pieces eaten on first day - pieces eaten on second day = remaining pieces
60 - 30 - 10 = 20 pieces

Finally, we find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the third day:
1. He ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces on the third day.
2. So, the number of pieces he ate on the third day is (7/13) * (remaining pieces): (7/13) * 20 = 7 * 2 = 14 pieces

                 [/INST] First, we need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

Cost of 7 bottles of soda = $21.00
Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * Cost of one bottle of soda

So,
3 * Cost of one bottle of soda = $21.00
Cost of one bottle of soda = $21.00 / 3 ≈ $7.00

Now, we know that 4 bottles of water cost $8.00. So,
Cost of one bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00

Next, we find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * Cost of one bottle of soda = 3 * $7.00 = $21.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * Cost of one bottle of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00

Therefore, the total cost will be:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many bolts David can buy with $12.48.
$12.48 ÷ $0.03/bolt = 4106.67 bolts
Since David cannot buy a fraction of a bolt, he can buy 4106 bolts instead of the desired 16. So, we need to find how much money it costs to buy 16 bolts, and then subtract that amount from $12.48.

Step 2: Find out how much money it costs to buy 16 bolts.
Cost of 16 bolts = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Cost of 16 bolts = 16 * $0.03
Cost of 16 bolts = $0.48

Step 3: Subtract the cost of 16 bolts from David's initial amount.
Remaining money = Initial amount - Cost of 16 bolts

For multiple-choice questions:
Number of questions = 10
Points earned per question = 1
Percentage of correct answers = 80%

Points_MC = Number of questions * Points per question * Percentage of correct answers
= 10 * 1 * 0.8

For true/false questions:
Number of questions = 20
Points earned per question = 1

Step 3: Add the points earned from all three types of questions to find the total score.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of chickens Isaias will sell to make a profit of $2000.
Isaias makes a profit of $2000 when he sells chickens worth $2000 more than he paid for them. Let's denote the cost of one chicken as C.
Profit = Number of chickens * (Selling price - Cost)
$2000 = (Number of chickens) * ($50 - C)

Step 2: Solve for the number of chickens that Isaias should sell.
To find the number of chickens that Isaias should sell, we need to express Number of chickens in terms of C.
$2000 = (Number of chickens) * ($50 - C)
$2000 = Number of chickens * $49 (subtract C from $50)
Number of chickens = $2000 / $49 ≈ 40.82
Since Isaias can't sell a fraction of a chicken, he should sell as many chickens as possible while keeping the profit at $2000. So he'll sell 41 chickens.

Step 3: Determine the total revenue generated from selling the chickens.
Total revenue = Number of chickens sold * Selling price
Total revenue = 41 * $50
Total revenue = $2050

Step 4: Find the cost of the chickens that Isaias took to the market for sale.
To find the cost, we need to find how many chickens Isaias took to the market, i.e., 3/5 of his total chickens. Let's denote the total number of chickens on the farm as T.
Number of chickens to be sold = 41 (from step 2)
Number of chickens to be taken to the market = Number of chickens to be sold * (Percentage to be taken to the market / 100%)
Number of chickens to be taken to the market = 41 * (60 / 100) = 24.6
Since Isaias can't take a fraction of a chicken to the market, he'll take 25 chickens to the market.
Cost = Number of chickens taken to the market * Cost
Cost = 25 * C

Step 5: Solve for C (cost of one chicken).
We already found that the total revenue is $2050. We also know that the cost for 25 chickens is C * 25.
$2050 = C * 25 + C * 41
$2050 = 2C * 66
$2050 = 132C
C = $15.32 (approximately)

Step 6: Determine the total cost of the chickens taken to the market.
Total cost = Cost * Number of chickens
Total cost = $15.32 * 25
Total cost = $383.00

Step 7: Summarize the findings.
To sell 41 chickens and make a profit of $2000, Isaias needs to buy chickens costing approximately $15.32 per piece. He takes 25 chickens to the market, with a total cost of about $383.

So the final answer is: Isaias has to buy approximately 41 chickens at $15.32 each and take 25 of them to the market at a cost of $383.</s>","Isaias plans to sell 3/5*300 = <<3/5*300=180>>180 chickens from his farm.
To make his profit, Isaias sells all the chicken he took to the market for $50*180 = $<<50*180=9000>>9000
The price at which Isaias bought the chicken is $9000-$2000 = $<<9000-2000=7000>>7000.

Total glasses sold = Julie's glasses + Boys' glasses
32 = 14 + Boys' glasses
Boys' glasses = 32 - 14 = 18

Now that we know each boy sold 18 glasses, we can compare the number of glasses sold by Julie and each boy to find the difference:

Julie's glasses = 14
Micah's glasses = 18
Difference in glasses sold = July - Micah
Difference in glasses sold = 14 - 18 = -4

However, since we cannot have a negative number of glasses, this indicates an error in the problem statement. The number of glasses sold by Julie or Micah should be such that the total number of glasses sold (32) is the sum of their sales.

   Amount spent on new rope = ? * $1.5/meter

3. To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we subtract the amount she spent on the new rope from her total profit:

If Kelly’s budget is ? $65 ; then how much money, , in dollars, does she have left in her budget?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the cost of bacon and chicken.
- The total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
- Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
- So, the cost of one pack of chicken is $10 × 2 = $20.
- Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the cost of chicken is $20 × 6 = $120.

Step 2: Find the cost of strawberries and apples.
- The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is $4 × 3 = $12.
- The cost of 7 packs of apples is $4 × 7/2 = $14.

Step 3: Find the total cost of all items in Kelly's cart.
- The total cost of all items is $10 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $146.

Step 4: Find the difference between the total cost and Kelly’s budget to find the amount of money left in her budget.
- The difference is $146 (total cost) - $65 (budget) = -$81.

However, since we cannot have a negative budget, it seems that Kelly does not have enough money in her budget based on the given information.

Therefore, based on the information provided, Kelly does not have enough money in her budget. {The final answer is: The difference between Kelly's budget and the cost of her groceries is a negative number, indicating that she does not have enough money in her budget.}</s>","Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.

                 [/INST] To find the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to find the difference between the length of the final concert and the length of the encore. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. We know that the final concert lasts for 65 minutes, including the 15-minute encore.
2. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so we can find the length of her usual concerts by dividing the length of the final concert by 2 and then subtracting the length of the encore.
3. Length of usual concert = (Length of final concert - Length of encore) / 2
4. Substituting the given values, we get:length of usual concert = (65 minutes - 15 minutes) / 2
5. Simplifying, we get:length of usual concert = (50 minutes) / 2
6. Therefore, the length of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

{The final answer is: Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.}</s>","The concert, minus the encore, lasted for 65-minute concert – 15-minute encore = <<65-15=50>>50 minutes.
This is twice as long as her usual concerts so her usual concert must have a runtime of 50 minutes / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

3. Argo gave 30 toys to Nicky.

To find the number of toys Argo has left, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the original number of toys he had.

Total toys Argo gave away = Toys for Alyssa + Toys for Bonnie + Toys for Nicky

                 [/INST] To determine how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange on the stage, we first need to find out how many microphones can form pairs. We know that the singer has 50 microphones.

Step 1: Find out how many microphones can form pairs.
Pairs consist of two microphones each. So, to find out how many pairs can be formed from 50 microphones, we divide the total number of microphones by 2.

50 microphones ÷ 2 microphones per pair = 25 pairs

Step 2: Find out how many microphones won't be able to form pairs.
The problem states that 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in. We need to find out how many microphones this amounts to.

20% of 50 microphones = 0.2 × 50 = 10 microphones

Step 3: Adjust the number of pairs based on the unpaired microphones.
Since 10 microphones won't form pairs, we need to subtract those from the total number of pairs we found in Step 1.

25 pairs (from Step 1) - 10 unpaired microphones = 15 pairs

{The final answer is: The singer was able to arrange 15 pairs of microphones on the stage.}</s>","The number of microphones that were not able to find space on the stage is 20/100*50 = <<20/100*50=10>>10
This means the singer could set 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 microphones into pairs on the stage.
Since a pair has 2 microphones, the singer set up 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

Step 2: 2/3rds of that number of birds flying overhead. To find out how many birds are flying overhead, we need to calculate 2/3 of 6:

2/3 * 6 = 4

So, there are 4 birds flying overhead.

Step 3: There are 3 groups of 8 birds feeding. We find out how many birds are feeding by calculating the number of birds in each group and then multiplying that number by the number of groups:

Number of birds feeding = Birds per group * Number of groups
= 8 * 3
= 24

Step 4: So far, Jerry has counted 6 nesting birds + 4 overhead birds + 24 feeding birds. Let's see the total number of birds Jerry has counted:

Total number of birds = Nesting birds + Overhead birds + Feeding birds
= 6 + 4 + 24

                 [/INST] To find the speed of a whirligig, we first need to determine the relationship between the speeds of a whirligig, a thingamabob, and a whatchamacallit.

1. We know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. So, if the thingamabob spins at speed S, then the whirligig spins at 5S.

2. We also know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. So, a whatchamacallit spins at 11S.

3. We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. We can set up a proportion to find the value of S:

   S / 1 = 121 m/s / (11 * S)
   121 = 11S
   121 = 11 * S
   11S = 121
   S = 121 / 11
   S = 11 m/s

4. Now that we know the speed of a thingamabob, we can find the speed of a whirligig:

   Whirligig speed = 5 * Thingamabob speed
   Whirligig speed = 5 * 11 m/s
   Whirligig speed = 55 m/s

{The final answer is: A whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.}</s>","A thingamabob spins 1/11 as fast as a whatchamacallit, so it spins at 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the price of one carrot as ""x"". We are given that:

1. The cost of two carrots is $11 total. So, 2x = $11.
2. The cost of a salad is $6.
3. The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad. So, y = $6 / 2 = $3.

We want to find the cost of one carrot, x. Since we know that the cost of two carrots is $11, we can set up an equation:

2x = $11

To find the value of x, we need to solve this equation:

x = $11 / 2
x = $5.5

Now, we have the price of one carrot, $5.5. However, we made an error in our earlier calculation of x. We should have calculated the cost difference between the total cost of all items and the salad cost first before finding the cost of one carrot. Let's recalculate:

Total cost = 2(Cost of one carrot) + Cost of salad + Cost of yogurt
$11 = 2x + $6 + $3
$11 = 2x + $9

To find the cost of one carrot, we need to first find the cost of the yogurt, which is half the cost of the salad:

Cost of yogurt = $6 / 2 = $3

Then, we can subtract the cost of the salad and the cost of the yogurt from the total cost to find the cost of one carrot:

$11 - $6 - $3 = x
$2 = x

But obviously, we cannot have a value of $2 for a single carrot. The error in the question lies in the claim that the yogurt is ""half the price"" of the salad. The problem statement implies that there is a mistake in the given prices, and without accurate information, it is impossible to determine the true cost of one carrot.

Therefore, we cannot find the final answer with the given information.</s>","Ellen's yogurt cost is half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.
For the two carrots Ellen needs to pay $11 - $6 - $3 = $<<11-6-3=2>>2.
So one carrot costs $2 / $2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.

The following week, . she mowed , Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, how ; much did she make ? from lemonade , sales?
                 [/INST] To find out how much Tasha made from selling lemonade, we first need to determine how much she made from mowing lawns for Kamala and Alba, and then subtract that amount from the total amount she made last month.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as x.

First week:
- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she mowed Joe's lawn: x * 3

Second week:
- Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she mowe Joe's lawn: 5 * x

We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn, so:
- Tasha made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn: x * $6

Now let's set up a proportion to find out how many times Tasha mowed Kamala's and Alba's lawns:

x (Joe's lawn) : 3x (Kamala's lawn) :: 1 : 3
x : 3x : 1 : 3
x : 4x

x = 4x / 3
x = 4/3 x
x = 4x / 3
x = 3x / 2

2x = 4x
x = 2x
x = 2x / 1
x = 2x

x = 2x (This equation is meaningless, but it indicates that x is a multiple of 2.)

Since we know that x = Joe's lawns = 1, and x is a multiple of 2, the only possible value for x would be 2.

So, in the first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn six times.

In the second week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn ten times.

Total lawn mowing income = 6 * $6 (for Kamala) + 5 * $6 * 5 (for Alba) = $36 + $120 = $156

Total income last month = $156 (lawn mowing) + ? ($X) (lemmaedade sales)

The final answer is {$156 + X}. However, since the question only asked for the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales and not the total amount she made last month, this answer is incomplete. To find just the lemonade sales amount, you would need additional information about how much she made per glass of lemonade or the number of glasses she sold. To determine the final answer for the lemonade sales amount, at least one of those pieces of information is required.</s>","At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars
Since the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.
Adding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars
Subtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars
Tasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.

Step 2: From the information given, we know that:
- Martin's weight is 55 kg
- Carl's weight is greater than Martin's weight (55 kg), so Carl weighs at least 56 kg
- Christian's weight is greater than Carl's weight (56 kg or more), so Christian weighs at least 57 kg

Step 3: We are also told that Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight. So, Harry's weight is:

Weight of Harry = Weight of Christian - 5 kg
Weight of Harry = (Weight of Christian - 5) kg

Step 4: Since Christian's weight is at least 57 kg, we know that Harry's weight must be:

Weight of Harry = Weight of Christian - 5 kg
Weight of Harry = (57 kg - 5 kg)
Weight of Harry = 52 kg

{The final answer is: Harry's weight is 52 kg}</s>","Carl’s weight is 55 + 16 = <<55+16=71>>71 kg.

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue John earns each month from renting out his car.
Total revenue = Total hours × Hourly rate
Total revenue = 30 hours/month × $25/hour
Total revenue = $750/month

Step 3: Subtract the car payment from the total revenue to find the profit.
Profit = Total revenue - Car payment

1. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha.
2. Let's call the number of notebooks Martha had ""m"".
3. The number of notebooks Joseph had was therefore ""3m"".

Now let's find out how many notebooks Martha has after buying 5 more:

1. Martha initially had ""m"" notebooks.
2. She bought 5 more, so now she has ""m + 5"" notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we need to subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

{The final answer is: Martha has 3 + m notebooks, and Joseph has m notebooks. So, she has (3 + m) - m = 3 more notebooks than Joseph. Therefore, she has 3 more notebooks than Joseph, making a total of 3 + m = (m + 3) notebooks.}

So, the final answer is: Martha has 3 more notebooks than Joseph, making a total of m + 3 notebooks.</s>","Since she bought 5 more to have 7, she originally had 7-5 = <<7-5=2>>2 notebooks

Since Calvin and his wife are adults, there are two adults in the family. Therefore, Calvin has enough soup for two adults, which is equivalent to four bowls since each adult eats one bowl.

So, Calvin initially prepared soup for 4 bowls (2 for adults). However, some soup will be left over after their meal. Let's find out how many bowls of soup the two children will have each for dinner. Each child eats one bowl, so the two children together will eat 2 bowls.

Calvin had 4 bowls of soup, and 2 of those were consumed by the adults. So, there are still 2 bowls of soup left. The remaining soup is for the children. Since two children each have one bowl, the leftover soup will accommodate the whole family for lunch.

Hence, the final answer is: Each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup one time. {The final answer is: Each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup one time.}</s>","Four adult bowls equal eight children’s bowls, so each adult bowl is 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 children’s bowls.

Thus, he, his wife, and their children will eat 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 children’s bowls at dinner.
After dinner, there will be 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 children’s bowls left over.
There are 2 children, so each child will be able to eat a bowl of leftover soup for lunch 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1 time.

* For large masks: With 2.25 yards of material, Jo can make 3 large masks. So, the material needed for one large mask is 2.25 yards / 3 large masks = 0.75 yards.

Step 2: Calculate how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

* For small masks: She needs to make 20 small masks, so she'll require 20 * 0.5 yards = 10 yards.
* For large masks: She needs to make 8 large masks, so she'll require 8 * 0.75 yards = 6 yards.

Step 3: Find the total amount of material needed to make both small and large masks.

* Total material required = Material for small masks + Material for large masks = 10 yards (small masks) + 6 yards (large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Step 3: Dean then gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Step 4: To find out how many marbles are left with Dean, we subtract the marbles given to Jamie and Donald from the initial number of marbles Dean had:

Marbles left for Dean = Initial marbles - Marbles given to Jamie - Marbles given to Donald

                 [/INST] Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Let's denote:
   * D: Duncan's current age, which is 60.
   * A: Adam's age now.

2. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So we have:
   Duncan (age 60) = Duncan (age 60 - 8)
   and
   Adam (age A) = Adam (age A - 4).

3. Setting up the equation from the given information, we have:
   2 * Adam(A-4) = Duncan(60 - 8).

4. Solving the equation for Adam's age A:
   Adam(A) = (Duncan(60-8) / 2) + 4.

5. Substituting Duncan's current age (60) into the equation:
   Adam(A) = (60-8)/2 + 4.

6. Calculate the value of Adam's age in 8 years:
   Adam(A+8) = (60-8)/2 + 4 + 8.

7. Simplify the expression:
   Adam(A+8) = (29)/2 + 12.

8. Multiply the numerator by 2 and add 12 to get Adam's age in 8 years:
   Adam(A+8) = 29*1 + 12 = 31 + 12 = 43.

{The final answer is: Adam will be 43 years old in 8 years.}</s>","Eight years ago, Duncan was 60-8 = 52 years old, the same as Adam's age four years ago.
Therefore, four years ago, Adam's age was 52/2 =<<52/2=26>>26 years.
Currently, Adam is 26+4 = <<26+4=30>>30 years old.
In 8 years from now, Adam will be 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.

Step 3: Substitute the known value of Farm size of Farmer Brown (which is 200 acres) into the above equation:
   Farm size of Farmer Smith = 2 * (200 acres)

Step 4: Multiply 2 times 200 to get the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
   Farm size of Farmer Smith = 400 acres

Step 5: Add the sizes of both farms to find the total size:

1. Colby works in the packaging division of a manufacturing company.
2. He is paid $0.20 for every package he completes.
3. He completes 50 - x packages per hour (x < 10).

Now, we need to find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour, and accordingly, how much he earns in an eight-hour workday.

Step 1: Find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour:
Packages completed in an hour = 50 - x

Since x < 10, we can take x = 3 as an example:
Packages completed in an hour = 50 - 3 = 47

Step 2: Find out how many packages Colby completes in an eight-hour workday:
Packages completed in a workday = Packages completed in an hour * Hours worked
Packages completed in a workday = 47 * 8 = 376

Step 3: Find out how much Colby earns in an eight-hour workday:
Earnings in a workday = Packages completed in a workday * Pay per package
Earnings in a workday = 376 * $0.20 = $75.20

{The final answer is: Colby earns $75.20 in a typical eight-hour workday.}</s>","Ten less than fifty is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 packages per hour.
At $0.20 per completed package. if he completes 40 packages per hour he earns 40*$0.20=$<<40*0.20=8>>8 per hour.
Thus, in a typical eight-hour day, he earns 8*$8=$<<8*8=64>>64.

1. John finishes a normal Sudoku puzzle in 45 minutes.
2. A normal Sudoku puzzle takes John 45 minutes to complete.
3. An extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 4 times that long. So, an extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes.
4. Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, the number of bottles he drinks in the time it takes to complete an extreme Sudoku puzzle is 180 minutes / 30 minutes/bottle = 6 bottles.

{The final answer is: John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes to complete an extreme Sudoku puzzle.}</s>","He drinks a bottle of water every 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 minutes

                 [/INST] To find out how many yellow balloons there were in the bundle, we first need to determine how many pieces of bologna Benny used for the red and yellow balloons.

1. For each red balloon, Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna. So, for 20 red balloons, he used 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 pieces of bologna.

2. For each yellow balloon, Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna. So, to find out how many yellow balloons there are, we need to find how many yellow balloons correspond to the difference between the total number of balloons (58) and the number of red balloons (20).

3. First, let's find the total number of pieces of bologna Benny threw:
   - For red balloons: 40 pieces/balloon * 20 balloons = <<40*20=800>>800 pieces
   - For yellow balloons: X pieces/balloon * Y balloons = 58 pieces (we don't know X and Y yet)

4. Since we know that Benny threw 800 pieces for red balloons, and 58 pieces were for yellow balloons, we have the equation: 2 * 20 * pieces/red_balloon + 3 * Y * pieces/yellow_balloon = 800.

5. We can simplify the equation as: 40 * pieces/red_balloon + 3 * Y * pieces/yellow_balloon = 800. Since we don't know the pieces value for a red or yellow balloon yet, we can't directly solve this equation.

However, since Benny used fewer pieces of bologna for red balloons than for yellow balloons, we can conclude that the number of yellow balloons is less than the number of red balloons.

From the given information, we know that Benny threw:
- 40 * 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 pieces of bologna for 20 red balloons
- 58 pieces of bologna in total (some of which were for red balloons, and some for yellow balloons)

Since the number of pieces of bologna for yellow balloons is greater than the number of pieces for a single red balloon (3 > 2), we know that there must be fewer yellow balloons than red balloons.

Therefore, the difference between the total number of balloons, which is 20 (red) + X (yellow), and the number of red balloons, is the number of yellow balloons. In our equation: 20 (known) + X (unknown) = 58 (total number of balloons), we have X = 58 - 20 = <<58-20=38>>38.

But, since Benny threw fewer pieces of bologna for each yellow balloon than for each red balloon, our initial assumption that X > 20 wasn't correct. The correct answer is X = 38, which means there were 20 red balloons and 38 yellow balloons in the bundle.

{The final answer is: 20 red balloons and 38 yellow balloons}</s>","If Benny had twenty red balloons in the bundle, and he threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, then he threw 2*20=40 pieces of bologna at red balloons in the bundle.
If he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at balloons in the bundle, then he threw 58-40=<<58-40=18>>18 pieces of bologna at yellow balloons.
If he threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, then he had 18/3=<<18/3=6>>6 yellow balloons.

                 [/INST] To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs in a 30-day month, we first need to determine how many miles he drives in a month. We know that he drives 100 miles a day:

Miles driven in a month = Miles driven per day * Number of days
Miles driven in a month = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Miles driven in a month = 3000 miles

Now that we know Jon drives 3000 miles in a month, we can calculate how many tune-ups he will need:

Tune-ups needed = Miles driven between tune-ups / Total miles driven in a month

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven in a month (3000 miles) by the number of miles between tune-ups (1000 miles):

Tune-ups needed = 3000 miles / 1000 miles
Tune-ups needed = 3 tune-ups

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a tune-up, Jon would need to have at least 4 tune-ups in a month. To minimize his tune-ups, he should try to reach the next 1000-mile mark when possible (for example, by driving 1100 miles in his last 10 days to have a tune-up at the end of the month).

{The final answer is: Jon would need at least 4 tune-ups in a 30-day month, assuming he drives 100 miles a day.}</s>","He drives 100*30=<<100*30=3000>>3000 miles

4. So, they spent $0.5 on each balloon, and 1 dozen balloons cost $3 (12 * $0.25).
5. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, and each tub cost $7.
6. Therefore, the total amount spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $11 + $3 + $7 = $21.
7. Since their mother gave the same amount to each girl, and they spent $21 together, we can find out how much their mother gave to each girl by dividing the total amount spent by 2.

Step 2: Tennis has 6 students, so each tennis team has 6 players.

Step 3: Volleyball has twice the number of students as tennis, so each volleyball team has 6 * 2 = 12 players.

Step 4: We know how many students are playing each sport, but we don't have a breakdown of boys and girls within each group. Let's assume for now that there are equal numbers of boys and girls in each group.

Step 5: There are 16 boys playing soccer, so there must be 16 girls playing soccer as well, making a total of 16 boys + 16 girls = 32 students playing soccer.

Step 6: Since we don't know how many students are participating in tennis and volleyball as boys and girls, let's assume for now that there are a total of N students in tennis and 2N students in volleyball.

Step 7: The total number of students can be calculated as: Students in total = Students in tennis + Students in volleyball + Students in soccer

Step 8: We know that Students in tennis = 6 and Students in soccer = 32. We can find Students in volleyball by using the given information: Students in volleyball = 2 * Students in tennis = 2 * 6 = 12

Step 9: So, the total number of students is: Students in total = 6 + 12 + 32 = 48

However, this answer does not match the information given in the problem that there are a total of 16 boys and 22 girls. We must have made an error in our assumptions.

Step 10: Let's reconsider our initial assumption that there are equal numbers of boys and girls in each tennis and volleyball team. If we assume instead, that there are 5 boys and 1 girl in each tennis team, and 6 boys and 6 girls in each volleyball team, this would give us:

- Tennis: 5 boys * number of tennis teams + 1 girl * number of tennis teams = 5N + N = 6N
- Volleyball: 6 boys * number of volleyball teams + 6 girls * number of volleyball teams = 12N
- Soccer: 16 boys + 22 girls = 38 students

Step 11: Calculating the total number of students, we get: Students in total = 6N (tennis teams) + 12N (volleyball teams) + 38 = 18N + 38 = 18N + 36 + 2 = 18N + 38

Step 12: Unfortunately, the problem did not provide sufficient information to determine an exact value for N, and thus we cannot calculate a definitive answer for the total number of students.

Final answer: The problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact number of students in total. {The final answer is ""undetermined""}.</s>","There are 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 students playing volleyball.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.
Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, so:
Total lollipops sold = Number of students * Average lollipops sold per student
Total lollipops sold = 30 * 10 = 300 lollipops

Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying the lollipops for the class.
Cost per lollipop for the class = Cost per lollipop sold * Number of lollipops bought by each student
Cost per lollipop for the class = $0.5 * 10 = $5 per student
Total cost for buying lollipops = Total number of students * Cost per lollipop for the class
Total cost for buying lollipops = $5 * 30 = $150

Step 3: Calculate the profit made by the class on each sold lollipop.
Profit per lollipop = Selling price - Buying price
Profit per lollipop = $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3

Step 4: Calculate the total profit made by the class.
Total profit = Total number of lollipops sold * Profit per lollipop
Total profit = 300 * $0.3 = $90

The final answer is: The class was able to raise a profit of $90 from selling lollipops.</s>","The class got $0.8 - $0.5 = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3 profit from each lollipop.
So each student raised $0.3 x 10 = $<<0.3*10=3>>3 from selling 10 lollipops.
Therefore, they were able to raise a total of $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of cats Larry has as C, the number of dogs as D, and the number of rabbits as R.

1. Larry has 3 cats, so C = 3.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so D = 3C = 3 * 3 = 9.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so R = D - 2.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so the number of fish is F = 3R.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so the number of gerbils is G = F / 3.

Now, let's find out the total number of pets Larry has:

Pets = Cats + Dogs + Rabbits + Fish + Gerbils
Pets = 3 + 9 + R + 3R + F / 3

Substitute R = D - 2 into the equation:

Pets = 3 + 9 + (D-2) + 3(D-2) + F / 3

Now, substitute F = 3R into the equation:

Pets = 3+9+(D-2) + 3(D-2) + (3R) / 3

Simplifying, we get:

Pets = 3+9+(D-2) + 3D - 2D + 3R
Pets = 3+9+D + 3R - D
Pets = 12 + 3R

So the problem states that R = D - 2 and F = 3R. Substituting R with D-2 and F with 3(D-2), we can write:

D = 3C = 3 * 3 = 9, so R = D - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7
F = 3R = 3 * 7 = 21

Now we can calculate the total number of pets:

Pets = 12 + 3R = 12 + 3(7) = 12 + 21 = 23.

{The final answer is 23}.</s>","Larry has 3 cats and 3 times as many dogs as cats, for 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 dogs

Larry has 1 /3 as many gerbils as he has fish, for 21/3= 7 gerbils
Adding these all together, he has 9+7+21+7+3= <<9+7+21+7+3=47>>47 pets

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of slices each person can have in one day.
Abby can eat 2 slices a day, so she will finish 1 loaf in:
Abby's days = Number of slices for Abby / Slices per day for Abby
Abby's days = 24 slices / 2 slices
Abby's days = 12 days

Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so he will finish 1 loaf in:
Josh's days = Abby's days * 2
Josh's days = 12 days * 2
Josh's days = 24 days

                 [/INST] To find out how many shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to determine how many shells she collects in total between the ages of 5 and 10.

First, let's calculate how many months there are between Martha's 5th birthday and her 10th birthday. A person's age in years is equal to the number of completed years, so a person turns 6 years old in their 6th year. Therefore, Martha turns 6 years old when she is 5 years and 6 months old. Similarly, Martha turns 10 years old when she is 10 years old + the number of months between her 9th and 10th birthdays. Since Martha turns 10 in her 10th year, there are only a few months left in the year, so she will be between 8 and 12 months old when she turns 10. Let's assume she turns 10 in August, so she has 8 months from her 9th birthday to her 10th birthday.

Martha collects one shell every month, so the number of shells she collects is equal to the number of months she collects for. Therefore, Martha collects:

1 shell per month * 5 years (from age 5 to age 10) * 12 months per year = 60 shells

But Martha does not collect any shells during the last few months of her 9th year or the first few months of her 10th year, since she turns 10 before collecting those shells. So we need to subtract the number of months between her 9th and 10th birthdays from the total number of months she collects for (excluding the months where she doesn't collect any shells):

Total months collecting = 5 years * 12 months/year + 8 months (from age 9 to age 10) - 3 months (from age 9 where she doesn't collect)
= 60 months - 3 months
= 57 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she collects is:

Total shells = Total months collecting
= 57 shells

Therefore, {The final answer is: Martha will have collected 57 shells by her 10th birthday}.</s>","In 12 months of the year, Martha collects 12 * 1 = <<12*1=12>>12 shells.
From her 5th to her 10th birthday, 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 years have passed.
During the 5 years that have passed, Martha has collected 12 * 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 shells.

                    question:
                    ! Lana is brewing cups of tea for her friends. She has 27 cups, and she divides these into 3 rows. In each row, she . creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint . tea cups. She ! then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. How , many cups of mint tea are in each ? row?
                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Lana has 27 cups in total, and she places them in 3 rows. So the number of cups in each row is:

Number of cups in each row = Total number of cups / Number of rows
= 27 cups / 3 rows
= 9 cups

Now, Lana puts equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row. Since there are 9 cups in each row, the number of cups of tea for each type (chamomile or mint) in each row is:

Number of cups of each type in each row = Number of cups in each row / 2 (since there are 2 types of tea)
= 9 cups / 2
= 4.5 cups

Since it's not possible to have half a cup of tea, Lana must have made a mistake or assumed there would be an even number of cups in each row for the sake of simplicity. To have an exact number of cups for both chamomile and mint tea, Lana would need 10 cups in each row. In this case, she would have 10 cups of chamomile tea and 10 cups of mint tea, for a total of 20 cups per row.

However, based on the information provided, the final answer is:

{The number of mint tea cups in each row is 4.} (As given in the problem, not considering the issue with having half a cup of tea.)

However, it's essential to point out that, given the problem's constraints, Lana cannot equalize the number of cups of both types in each row without making an error in her calculations.

To avoid this issue, the solution would be to have 10 cups in each row instead. Then the number of mint tea cups in each row would be 5, and the total would be 25 cups of mint tea (3 rows × 5 cups/row=15 cups/type×2=25 cups).</s>","If there are 15 cups of cinnamon tea, then there are a total of 27 – 15 = <<27-15=12>>12 cups of chamomile or mint tea.
As there are equal amounts of chamomile tea and mint tea, there is a total of 12 cups / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cups of mint tea.
Dividing these into rows shows that each row holds 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 cups of mint tea.

                 [/INST] To find the least number of berries the sloth needs to pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we first need to find out how many trips he makes in 8 hours and how long each trip takes.

1. We know that each trip takes 4 hours.
2. Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth makes 8 hours / 4 hours = <<8/4=2>>2 trips.

Now that we know the sloth makes two trips in 8 hours, we need to find the number of berries he picks up on each trip to have a total of 24 berries.

Let x be the number of berries picked up in one trip.
So, in 2 trips, the sloth picks up 2 * x = <<2*x=2x>>2x berries.

We want 2x to be equal to 24, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 24
x = 12

{The least number of berries the three-toed sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12.}</s>","If one trip is 4-hours long, in 8 hours he can make 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 trips.

- There are 10000 gallons of water in the pool.
- Anthony and his father fill their tank with half the amount of water in the pool (10000 gallons / 2 = 5000 gallons).
- They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden at a rate of 500 gallons per day.

Step 2: Determine how many gallons of water are in the tank after it's filled.
- The tank holds 5000 gallons of water.

Step 3: Calculate how many gallons of water are used in 6 days.
- Water used per day = 500 gallons
- Total water used in 6 days = Water used per day * Number of days
  = 500 gallons * 6 days

Step 4: Determine how many gallons of water are left in the tank after it's emptied.
- Initial water in the tank = 5000 gallons
- Water used = 3000 gallons
- Remaining water = Initial water in the tank - Water used

He has received $150 from his parents and spent:
- $10 * 5 (for 5 Fridays or Saturdays movies) = $50
- $7 * 8 (for 8 movies on other days) = $56
- $8 (for popcorn) = $8
- $2 (for a candy box) = $2
- $8 (for another popcorn) = $8
- $2 (for another candy box) = $2
- $10 (for the latest Friday movie) = $10

So, his total spending is $50 + $56 + $8 + $2 + $8 + $2 = $126. The amount of money left is $150 - $126 = $24.

Step 2: Calculate how many movies can he see with $24.
Movies on Fridays or Saturdays cost $10 each. So, he can see only $24 / $10 = 2 more movies on Fridays or Saturdays.
Since it's already a Friday and he has already seen 5 movies (including the current one), he cannot see another Friday or Saturday movie.

Movies on other days cost $7 each. So, he can see $24 / $7 = 3 and a half movies. Since he cannot watch half a movie, he can watch 3 movies on other days.

Number of mini cinnamon rolls = 200
Calories for a normal cinnamon roll = 600 calories
Since a mini cinnamon roll is 1/3 of a normal cinnamon roll:
Calories for a mini cinnamon roll = (1/3) * 600 calories = 200 calories
Total calories for mini cinnamon rolls = 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories

Step 2: Calculate the total calories for the mini blueberry muffins:
Number of mini blueberry muffins = 300
Calories for a normal blueberry muffin = 450 calories
Since a mini blueberry muffin is 1/3 of a normal blueberry muffin:
Calories for a mini blueberry muffin = (1/3) * 450 calories = 150 calories
Total calories for mini blueberry muffins = 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. So, on each of those days, she removed 2 * 39 = <2 x 39 = 78>.
Therefore, she removed 78 + 78 = <78 + 78 = 156> Junebugs on Tuesday and Wednesday.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
In total, Rita removed 39 + 78 + 48 = <39 + 156 = 193> Junebugs.
Since there were 5 days in this time period (Monday through Friday), the average number of Junebugs she removed per day is Total Junebugs Removed / Number of Days = 193 / 5 = {38.6}.

However, since it's unlikely for the average to be a non-integer value, there might be an error in the problem statement or in the data provided. Therefore, without further clarification, it's not possible to give a definitive answer.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled by each vehicle.

Bus: dist = speed * time
Bus distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Bus distance = 300 miles

Car: dist = speed * time
Car distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Car distance = 240 miles

Step 2: Find the difference in distance between the two vehicles.

Distance_difference = Bus_distance - Car_distance
Distance_difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Distance_difference = 60 miles

{The final answer is: The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.}</s>","The bus traveled 60 miles per hour * 5 hours = <<60*5=300>>300 miles.
The car traveled 30 miles per hour * 8 hours = <<30*8=240>>240 miles.
So, the bus went 300 - 240 = <<300-240=60>>60 miles farther than the car.

Sophie recently bought : a tube of bouncy : balls, bringing her total number : of toys for her nephew up to ? 62. How many bouncy . balls came ? in the ? tube?
                 [/INST] To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to find the total number of toys Sophie has and then subtract the number of toys she already had before she bought the tube.

First, let's find the number of toys Sophie had before she bought the tube:

1. Building blocks: There are 31 blocks in the bag.
2. Stuffed animals: There are 8 stuffed animals in the bin.
3. Stacking rings: There are 9 multicolored rings in the tower.

So, before buying the tube of bouncy balls, Sophie had:

Building blocks: 31
Stuffed animals: 8
Stacking rings: 9

Total toys before buying bouncy balls = Building blocks + Stuffed animals + Stacking rings
= 31 + 8 + 9
= 48

Now, let's find the number of toys Sophie has after buying the tube of bouncy balls:

She had 48 toys before buying the tube, and she bought a tube with a number of bouncy balls that raises her total number of toys to 62.

To find the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we can subtract the number of toys she had before buying it from the total number of toys she has now:

Total toys after buying bouncy balls = 62
Total toys before buying bouncy balls = 48

Number of bouncy balls = Total toys after buying bouncy balls - Total toys before buying bouncy balls
= 62 - 48
= 14

So, {The final answer is 14 bouncy balls came in the tube}.</s>","Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.
After buying the tube of balls, Sophie has 31 + 8 + 9 + T = 48 + T = 62 toys for her nephew.
Thus, T = 62 - 48 = <<62-48=14>>14 bouncy balls came in the tube.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. Let's represent the age of Peter as P, Paul as P_A, and Jean as J. Therefore, we have the equation: P + P_A + J = 100.

Step 2: We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean. So, P_A = J + 10.

Step 3: Substitute the value of P_A from the second equation into the first equation: P + (J+10) + J = 100.

Step 4: Simplify the equation: P + 2J + 10 = 100.

Step 5: To isolate the variable P, subtract 10 from both sides and subtract 2J from both sides: P = 2J + 60.

Step 6: At this point, we don't have sufficient information to determine the unique values of P, Paul, and Jean. However, we can express the age of Peter in terms of John's age.

Step 7: To find Peter's age when John is a certain age, we can substitute a specific value for J in the equation P = 2J + 60.

For example, if John is 25 years old, then Peter's age would be: P = 2(25) + 60 = 75 years.

{The final answer is: Peter's age is 75 years when Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and their combined age is 100 years.}</s>","Let x be the age of John. Paul’s age is x + 10
Peter’s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10
We have (2x + 10) + (x + 1) + x = 100
Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100
Subtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.
John is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old.

They already had 10 boxes: 50 boxes (from donations) + 10 boxes (already owned) = 60 boxes.

Step 2: Find out how many boxes can fit on one table.
Each table can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff: 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables (ignoring the decimal). However, since they cannot have a fraction of a table, they need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they need 31 tables.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total distance spitted by Zoey.
Zoey spits 40 seeds, and each seed is spitted a distance of 10 feet. So the total distance spitted by Zoey is: 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Step 2: Calculate the total distance spitted by Sydney.
Sydney spits 35 seeds, and each seed is spitted a distance of 12 feet. So the total distance spitted by Sydney is: 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Step 3: Calculate the average total distance spat.
To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spitted by both contestants by the number of contestants.
So, the average total distance spat is: (Total distance spitted by Zoey + Total distance spitted by Sydney) / Number of contestants = (400 feet + 420 feet) / 2 = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a day.
Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1140 widgets/day

Step 2: Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month (30 days).
Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets/month
WidgetMaster 9000: 1140 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 34,200 widgets/month

Step 3: Calculate the difference in the number of widgets produced in a month.
Difference = Widgeteer 3000 widgets - WidgetMaster 9000 widgets
Difference = 43,200 widgets - 34,200 widgets = 9,000 widgets

1. Cameron checks in at 5 pm and checks out at 10 am the next morning.
2. First, let's calculate the number of hours he spends during the 12-hour package:
   - From 5 pm to midnight (12 hours)

3. Since he stays until 10 am the next morning, we subtract the hours he spent during the day he arrived from the total 24-hour period:
   - 24 hours (total length of stay) - 12 hours (12-hour package) = 12 hours

4. Now, we need to calculate how many extra hours Cameron pays for:
   - He uses the pay-per-hour plan, so the number of hours after the initial 12 hours is 14 hours (10 am to noon the following day)

5. The cost of each additional hour is 70 pesos, so the total extra cost would be 14 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 980 pesos

6. To find out how much money Cameron saved by not paying for the 24-hour package, we subtract the extra cost from the price of the 24-hour package:
   - 1600 pesos (24-hour package) - 980 pesos (extra cost) = 620 pesos

{The final answer is: 620 pesos}</s>","12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.
If Cameron wants to leave at 10 am, he must pay for an additional 10 am - 5 am = <<10-5=5>>5 hours.

- For a goat: 5 pounds
- For a sheep: Twice the amount a goat needs = 2 * 5 = 10 pounds
- The difference is 3 pounds, so the amount of hay a sheep needs is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of hay needed for all the goats.
- There are 15 goats, so the total amount of hay for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of hay needed for all the sheep.
- There are 12 sheep, so the total amount of hay for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

Step 4: Add the hay for goats and sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs.

Step 2: Subtract the cost of gas and the deposit amount from John's weekly earnings.
Gas cost: 50 dollars
Bank deposit: 100 dollars
Total expenses: 50 dollars + 100 dollars = 150 dollars

Subtract the total expenses from John's weekly earnings: 300 dollars/week - 150 dollars = 150 dollars.

15*10 (Craig) + X*10 (Craig's brother) = 150 + 50
150 + X = 200
X = 50

Step 2: Craig's brother spells words with 50 more letters than Craig, so each word he spells has 15 + 50 = 65 letters.

1. We know that 8 children stand in one row.
2. There are 7 rows, one for each of the 5 different Schools.
3. So, the total number of children in the drill is the number of children in one row multiplied by the number of rows.

Total number of children = Children per row * Rows

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get with her coupons.
Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, and the teacher has 9 coupons, the teacher can get:

Bottles from coupons = Number of coupons * Bottles per coupon
Bottles from coupons = 9 * 100
Bottles from coupons = 900

Step 2: Calculate the number of bottles of apple juice given to each student.
Each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice.

Bottles per student = Bottles per student's lunch

Step 3: Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to all students.
Total bottles for all students = Number of students * Bottles per student
Total bottles for all students = 29 * 2
Total bottles for all students = 58 * 2
Total bottles for all students = 116

Step 4: Subtract the number of bottles given to students from the number of bottles the teacher had after redeeming her coupons.
Total bottles left for teacher = Teacher's initial bottles - Bottles for all students
Total bottles left for teacher = 900 - 116
Total bottles left for teacher = 884

{The final answer is: The teacher has 884 bottles of apple juice left for herself.}</s>","The teacher can redeem her coupons for 9 * 100 = <<9*100=900>>900 bottles of apple juice.

Cost of each CD = $15
Number of CDs James bought = 10
Total cost of CDs = $15 * 10 = $150

Step 2: Calculate the discount James received on these CDs.
Discount = 40% of $150
Discount amount = 0.4 * $150 = $60

1. First, let's calculate the revenue from selling yams:
   Number of yams: 6
   Price per yam: $1.5
   Revenue from selling yams: 6 * $1.5 = $9

2. Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling sweet potatoes:
   Number of sweet potatoes: 10
   Price per sweet potato: $2
   Revenue from selling sweet potatoes: 10 * $2 = $20

3. Lastly, let's calculate the revenue from selling carrots:
   Number of carrots: 4
   Price per carrot: $1.25
   Revenue from selling carrots: 4 * $1.25 = $5

4. To find the total revenue, we add the revenue from each type of crop:
   Total revenue: $9 (yams) + $20 (sweet potatoes) + $5 (carrots) = $34

{The final answer is $34.}</s>","Jen can earn $1.5 x 6 = $<<1.5*6=9>>9 for the yams.

After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the ? speed.  How long did it take him to get ? across the lake?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step:

Part 1: Distance swam by James
James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, and he swims 60% of the total distance. The total distance of the lake is 20 miles.

So, the distance James swam is: 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Part 2: Swimming time
To find out how long it took James to swim this 12-mile distance, we need to divide the distance covered by his swimming speed:

Swimming time = Distance swam / Swimming speed
Swimming time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

Part 3: Rest time
He stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time. Half of 6 hours is 3 hours.

Part 4: Distance left to swim
James still needs to swim the remaining distance, which is: Total distance - Distance swam = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

Part 5: Swimming speed for the remaining distance
He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed. So, his remaining swimming speed is: Swimming speed / 2 = 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour

Part 6: Time to cover the remaining distance
To find out how long it took James to swim the remaining 8 miles, we need to divide the distance covered by his swimming speed for the remaining distance:

Remaining time = Distance left / Swimming speed
Remaining time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

Part 7: Total time
To find the total time it took James to swim across the lake, we need to add the swimming time, the rest time, and the remaining time:

Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Remaining time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

{The final answer is, it took James 17 hours to get across the lake.}</s>","He swam 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 miles.
That took him 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 hours.
So he rested 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours.
He then swam the remaining 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8 miles.
His pace was 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 mph.
So it took him 8/1=<<8/1=8>>8 hours.
So in total, he took 6+3+8=<<6+3+8=17>>17 hours.

1. We know that Marcus is half of Leo's age, which can be written as: Marcus = (1/2) * Leo's age.
2. We also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus = Deanna - 5.
3. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get: (1/2) * Leo's age = Deanna - 5.
4. To solve for Leo's age, first, we need to isolate Leo's age by getting it on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2: 2 * (1/2) * Leo's age = 2 * (Deanna - 5).
5. Simplifying, we get: Leo's age = 2 * Deanna - 10.

The final answer is: Leo's age is 2 * Deanna - 10. In this case, Deanna is 26, so: Leo's age = 2 * 26 - 10 = 46. Therefore, Leo's age is 46.</s>","Marcus is 26 - 5 = <<26-5=21>>21 years old.

According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and Dinar scored 10 fewer points than Azibo. So, we have:

Bahati's points = Azibo's points + 20
Dinar's points = Azibo's points - 10

Step 2: We know that the total number of points scored by all three players is 45. So, we can write the equation:

Bahati's points + Azibo's points + Dinar's points = 45

Substitute Bahati's and Dinar's points with the equations from step 1:

(Azibo + 20) + x + (Azibo - 10) = 45

Step 3: Simplify the equation:

2Azibo + 20 + x - 10 = 45
2Azibo + x = 35

Step 4: Solve for Azibo's points (x):

We want to find the value of x. To do that, isolate x in the given equation:

2Azibo + x = 35
x = 35 - 2Azibo

Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:

Bahati's points = Azibo's points + 20 = x + 20

Substitute Bahati's points back into the equation:

x + 20 = 35
x = 15

So, Azibo scored 15 points.

{The final answer is: Azibo scored 15 points}</s>","Let B = the number of points Bahati scored
Azibo = B - 20

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of pages stacked in an inch. Since each paper is 1 inch high when stacked with one page on each side, we can calculate the number of pages per inch by dividing the total number of pages (100) by the thickness of the book in inches (1.5).

Number of pages per inch = Total number of pages / Thickness of the book
Number of pages per inch = 100 pages / 1.5 inches
Number of pages per inch = 66.67 pages per inch (approximately)

Step 2: Determine the number of pages printed on one side of the paper. We know that each paper is half an inch thick, and there are two sides (one side for printing and one side for the back), so the thickness of one side of the paper is 0.5 inches / 2 = 0.25 inches.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pages in the book based on the information given. Since there are approximately 66.67 pages per inch and one side of the paper can hold one page, we can find the number of pages in the book by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the number of pages that can fit on one side of the paper.

Number of pages in the book = Number of pages per inch * Number of pages on one side
Number of pages in the book = 66.67 pages per inch * 1 page per side
Number of pages in the book = 66.67 pages

Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we must round down or up to the nearest whole number. Here, since we're dealing with the number of pages in a book, we'll round up just to make sure we don't underestimate the number of pages.

                    question:
                    . Kim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. She is a ! sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing ; the : cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and ! was sleepwalking : from 2:15 to 2:38 am.  Also, ? that day she woke up 5 ! minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. ; How many minutes , did she sleep on her bed ; that day?
                 [/INST] To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to determine the total amount of time she spent sleeping in her bed.

First, let's find out how long she slept on her bed from the time she went to sleep until she woke up while sleepwalking. Since she went to sleep at 10 p.m., let's calculate the total number of minutes she spent sleeping before 2:15 a.m.

We know that:
1 hour = 60 minutes

Kim goes to sleep at 10 p.m. (22:00) and wakes up sleepwalking at 2:15 a.m. (02:15).

Total minutes before her sleepwalking episode = (Time she went to sleep - Time she woke up sleepwalking) x 60
= (22:00 - 02:15) x 60 = 6 hours 45 minutes = 405 minutes

Now, let's find out how long she sleepwalked that night, which is the time she was away from her bed:

From her statement, she sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m.

Total minutes during her sleepwalking episode = (End time - Start time)
= (02:38 - 02:15) = 23 minutes

Next, let's find out how long Kim spent in the bathroom before waking up 5 minutes earlier than usual:

She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual at 5:55 a.m. (since she usually wakes up at 6 a.m.)

The total amount of time she spent in the bathroom = 5 minutes = 5 minutes

Finally, we calculate the total amount of time Kim spent sleeping on her bed that day:

Total minutes slept in her bed = Total minutes spent sleeping before sleepwalking + Total minutes during non-sleepwalking hours - Total minutes slept during sleepwalking - Total minutes spent in bathroom
= 405 minutes + (60 minutes x 4) + 23 minutes - 5 minutes
= 405 minutes + 240 minutes + 23 minutes - 5 minutes
= 729 minutes = 12 hours 8 minutes

The final answer is: Kim slept on her bed for 12 hours 8 minutes that day.</s>","Out of 24 hours in a day, 10 pm represents 22 hours.
Until 12 p.m. or 24 hours, Kim slept 24 - 22 = <<24-22=2>>2 hours.
In total, Kim usually sleeps 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 hours a day.
In minutes, Kim usually sleeps 8 * 60 = <<8*60=480>>480 minutes
Kim was sleepwalking for a total of 38 - 15 = <<38-15=23>>23 minutes.
Within her usual sleep routine, Kim was sleepwalking or awake a total of 23 + 5 =<<23+5=28>>28 minutes.
On that day, Kim slept in her bed for 480 - 28 = <<480-28=452>>452 minutes.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan initially has. We know that he has 2/3 as many spoons as cups, and he has x dozen cups. So:

Initial number of measuring spoons = (2/3) * x * (number of spoons in a cup)

Step 2: Calculate the number of spoons given to Pedro for each gift. We know that he gave Pedro 6 spoons for each gift, and he gave x gifts. So:

Number of spoons given to Pedro = 6 * x

Step 3: Find out how many spoons are left with Jonathan after giving them all to Pedro.

Total number of spoons remaining = Initial number of spoons - Number of spoons given to Pedro

Total number of spoons remaining = (2/3) * x * (number of spoons in a cup) - 6 * x

Step 4: Calculate the number of spoons in a cup to find the exact number of spoons. We know that Jonathan has 2 dozen cups, so:

Total number of cups = 2 * 12 = 24
number of spoons in a standard measuring cup = 12 * (1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons, and 1 teaspoon = 5 metric spoons)
                        = 12 * 3 * 5
                        = 165

Now we can calculate the total number of spoons remaining:

Total number of spoons remaining = (2/3) * 24 * 165 - 6 * 24
Total number of spoons remaining = 4320 - 144
Total number of spoons remaining = 4176

{The final answer is: Jonathan has 4,176 utensils remaining.}</s>","A dozen measuring cups are 12, and if Jonathan has two dozens, he has 2*12 = 24 cups.
Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, so he has 2/3*24 = <<2/3*24=16>>16 measuring spoons.
When he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he remains with 16-6 = <<16-6=10>>10 measuring spoons.
He now has a total of 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = <<10+24=34>>34 utensils

". A : hospital has , a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, , 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in , the hospital after 2 weeks.","<s> [INST]

                    . A : hospital has , a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, , 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in , the hospital after 2 weeks.
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of occupied beds in the hospital.
We know that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied. so the number of occupied beds is:
1000 * 1/5 = 2000/5 = 400 beds

Step 2: Calculate the number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks.
Each day, 50 new patients are admitted, and there are 7 days in a week, so the number of new patients in a week is:
50 * 7 = 350
Over 2 weeks, the number of new patients is:
350 * 2 = 700

Step 3: Calculate the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.
After 2 weeks, the number of occupied beds is the initial number of occupied beds plus the number of new patients:
400 + 700 = 1100

Step 4: Calculate the number of unoccupied beds.
Since there are 1000 beds in total, and 1100 are occupied, the number of unoccupied beds is:
1000 - 1100 = -100

However, a negative number of beds doesn't make sense. It's likely there's an error in the problem statement. It's possible that the hospital initially had fewer than 1000 beds. To find the number of unoccupied beds, subtract the number of occupied beds from the hospital's initial capacity:

Initial capacity = 1000
Occupied beds = 1100

Unoccupied beds = Initial capacity - Occupied beds
                       = 1000 - 1100
                       = -100

This result doesn't make sense, which means the initially provided hospital capacity is incorrect.

The final answer is: There's an error in the problem statement. The given hospital capacity of 1000 beds is incorrect.</s>","If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.
If 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.
After two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.

                 [/INST] Let's walk through the problem step by step:

1. Robyn sends a total of sixteen emails a day.
2. Seven of these emails are work-related.
3. This leaves us with nine non-work emails (16 total emails - 7 work emails = 9).

To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her family, let's find two-thirds of the nine remaining emails:

4. Two-thirds of nine emails equals 6 emails (9 non-work emails * 2/3 ≈ 6 emails).

Now, to find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, let's find one-third of the nine remaining emails:

5. One-third of nine emails equals 3 emails (9 non-work emails * 1/3 ≈ 3 emails).

With this information, we can now determine how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day.

{The final answer is: 3 emails}</s>","Robyn sends 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 non-work emails.
She sends 9 * 2 / 3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 emails to family.
There are 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 emails remaining.
Of the remaining 3, 1/3 are to her boyfriend, so Robyn sends him 3 * 1 / 3 = <<3*1/3=1>>1 email a day.

                    question:
                    Shawna's father is , five times as old as Shawna. Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya. If . Aliya is 3 years old, how old is Shawna's father?
                 [/INST] Let's denote Shawna's age as S, Aliya's age as A, and Shawna's father's age as F. According to the problem:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna: F = 5S
2. Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya: S = 3A

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get: F = 5(3A)

Simplifying this equation, we have: F = 15A

Now we know that Aliya is currently 3 years old, so we can find Shawna's age: S = 3A, and since S = 3A, then A = S/3

Substituting this value of A back into the equation F = 15A, we get:

F = 15(S/3)

To find Shawna's father's age, we need to solve for F. To do this, we'll first find the value of S in terms of A:

S = 3A

Now we'll substitute S = 3A back into the equation F = 15(S/3):

F = 15(3A / 3)

Since 3/3 = 1, we can simplify this equation:

F = 15A

Now that we have an equation relating Shawna's father's age (F) to Aliya's age (A), and we know Aliya's age (A = 3), we can find Shawna's father's age.

F = 15(3)

Multiplying:

F = 45

So the final answer is: {Shawna's father is 45 years old}.</s>","Shawna is three times older than Aliya so Shawn is 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 years old.
Shawna's father is five times older than than Shawna, so her father is 9 * 5 = <<9*5=45>>45 years.

Courtney reported that there were 48 people at the concert.

Step 2: Determine the error in Courtney's count.
Kelly stated that Courtney had overstated the number of people by 20%, which is equivalent to an error of 20% of 48.

Step 3: Calculate the error.
Error = 20% of 48 = 0.2 * 48 = 9.6, rounded to the nearest whole number, this is an error of 10.

Step 4: Subtract the error from Courtney's count to find the actual number of people at the concert.
The final answer is: 48 - 10 = {38} people attended the concert.</s>","Since she overstated the number by 20%, 48 is 20% greater than the actual number i.e. 48 = 100% + 20% = 120% of the actual number = 120/100 of the actual number

                 [/INST] To find the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice, we need to use the information given about the number of balls carried by each boy.

1. We know that Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so let's represent the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x. Then, Jason carried 2x balls.
2. We also know that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2x = 2^2 * x = 4x balls.
3. The three boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip. So, the total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey.
4. Total number of balls = 4x (Jordan) + 2x (Jason) + x (Jeffrey)
5. Since the boys carried all balls in one trip, the total number of balls should be a multiple of 3, because there are 3 boys.
6. Let's test values of x that satisfy this requirement:
   If x = 6, then 4x = 24, 2x = 12, and x = 6. The total number of balls is 4x + 2x + x = 7x = 7 * 6 = 42 which is a multiple of 3.
7. Therefore, Jason picked up 6 balls, and since he carried half the number of balls carried by Jordan, that means Jordan carried 12 balls, and Jeffrey carried 6 balls.
8. So, the total number of basketballs the coach brought is 12 (Jordan) + 6 (Jason) + 6 (Jeffrey) = 12+6+6 = 24 balls.

{The final answer is 24}.</s>","Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 balls.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:
1. At the end of the first day, the pirates dug ten holes.
2. At the end of the second day, they dug ten holes (10) + thirteen holes (13) = 23 holes.
3. At the beginning of the third day, they dug eight holes. However, they stopped early to fill in two holes they had been falling into. So in total, they dug 8 + 2 = 10 holes on the third day.
4. By the end of the third day, they had dug a total of 23 (from the second day) + 10 (from the third day) = 33 holes.
5. The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, there were four times as many holes as there were at the end of the first day. So, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.
6. Therefore, before finding the treasure on the fourth day, they must have dug an additional 40 - 33 = 7 holes.

{The final answer is: The pirates dug 7 additional holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.}</s>","Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.
The island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.

After filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.
When they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.
Thus, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes on the fourth day.

1. Amora and Lainey get an equal number of corn chips, which is 70 for each. So, the number they share is:
   {Amora and Lainey's equal share = 70}

2. The third person gets 15 more corn chips than what Amora and Lainey get. So, the number of corn chips for the third person is:
   {Third person's chips = Amora and Lainey's chips + 15}

3. Since we have found the number of corn chips for Amora, Lainey, and the third person, we can calculate the total number of corn chips by adding their individual shares:
   {Total corn chips = Amora and Lainey's chips + Third person's chips}

2. According to the problem, the total cost of supplies and travel is $400. So, x (supplies) + 1.5x (travel) = $400

3. Solving for x, we have 2x = $400

4. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = $200 (The cost of supplies is $200).

                    Alex, Stan, ! and Adelwolfe are trying to catch them . all, Pokemon that is.  . Together they have caught 339 Pokemon. :  Alex has caught 5 ; more than Stan, and Stan ! has . caught 13 less than 4 times as many : as Adelwolfe , has caught. How many Pokemon has Stan caught?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the number of Pokemon Stan has caught as S. According to the problem, we know that:

1. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan, so he has caught S + 5 Pokemon.
2. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught. Let Adelwolfe's number be A. So, Stan's number is S < 4A - 13.
3. In total, the three of them have caught 339 Pokemon. So, S + (S + 5) + A = 339.

Step 2: Now we have three equations:

1. S + 5 = x (where x is the number of Pokemon Alex has caught)
2. S < 4A - 13
3. S + (S + 5) + A = 339

Step 3: Let's solve the third equation for A: A = 339 - S - (S + 5) = 334 - 2S.

Step 4: Since S < 4A - 13, we also have S < 4(334 - 2S) - 13. Solving this inequality for S requires some algebraic manipulation:
- Multiplying both sides by 4, we have 4S < 1335 - 5S - 13.
- Moving all terms to one side, we get 9S < 1322.
- Dividing both sides by 9, we have S < 147.

So, Stan must have caught a number of Pokemon less than 147.

Step 5: Going back to the second equation, S < 4A - 13. Substituting A = 334 - 2S in the inequality, we get:
- S < 4(334 - 2S) - 13
- S < 1336 - 8S - 13
- 9S < 1323
- S < 147

Since we already know that S < 147, this solution is valid and verifies the first inequality.

Therefore, based on the given conditions, Stan could have caught a number of Pokemon between 0 and 146, inclusive. However, the problem states that Stan has caught more than 56 Pokemon and less than 339. Using this information, we can limit the possibilities to 57 to 282 Pokemon, and since Stan has caught fewer than Alex and Adelwolfe, a reasonable guess would be Stan caught around 100 Pokemon.

{The final answer is: Stan likely caught around 100 Pokemon.}</s>","Let x represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught
Stan: 4x-13
Alex: 5+(4x-13)=4x-8
Total: x+4x-13+4x-8=339
9x-21=339
9x=360
x=<<40=40>>40 Pokemon
Stan:4(40)-13=147 Pokemon

"John just started watching a new show.  Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode.  How many minutes ? will John ? spend watching the show if he watches every episode?","<s> [INST]

                    question:
                    John just started watching a new show.  Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode.  How many minutes ? will John ? spend watching the show if he watches every episode?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. We also know that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

Let's represent the number of episodes as ""x"". Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can write the equation: x = y / 2, where y is the total number of minutes in the show.

We're given that x * 20 = y, so we can substitute x from the first equation into this equation: (y / 2) * 20 = y.

Simplifying the equation, we get: y / 2 = 20.

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we have: y = 40.

Now we know that y is the total number of minutes in the show. Since x = y / 2, we can find the number of episodes by dividing the total number of minutes by 2: x = 40 / 2 = 20.

Therefore, John will spend a total of {The final answer is 40 minutes} watching every episode of the show. However, since there are 20 episodes, he will actually spend 20 * 20 = 400 minutes (or 6 hours and 40 minutes) in total if he watches every episode one by one.

This answer may seem inconsistent with the initial assumption that there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode, but the original statement was not entirely correct. We assumed 40 minutes to be the total duration of the show and found that there are 20 episodes. To clarify, each episode is indeed 20 minutes long and there are 20 episodes in total, resulting in 20 * 20 = 400 minutes spent watching the entire show.

I hope this clarification helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>","Since there are half as many episodes as the number of minutes per episode, we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 episodes in total.
Since each episode is 20 minutes long, to find the total run time we perform 10*20= <<10*20=200>>200 minutes of run time in total.

                 [/INST] To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled during its journey.

First, let's find the distance the bird flew in each segment of the trip:

1. Flying south: The bird flew for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance covered during this segment is: Distance = Speed * Time. In this case: Distance = 30 miles per hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.
2. Flying north: The bird flew for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance covered during this segment is: Distance = Speed * Time. In this case: Distance = 18 miles per hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.
3. Flying south: The bird flew for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance covered during this segment is: Distance = Speed * Time. In this case: Distance = 22 miles per hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, we sum up the distances from each segment of the journey to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

Total distance = Distance flying south (300 miles) + Distance flying north (36 miles) + Distance flying south (110 miles)
                       = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles
                       = 446 miles

{The final answer is: The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles.}</s>","Flying for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, the bird travels 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 miles in a southerly direction.
Flying for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour, the bird travels 2*18=<<2*18=36>>36 miles in a northerly direction.
And flying for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour, the bird travels 5*22=<<5*22=110>>110 miles in a southerly direction.
Altogether, the distance between the bird's two homes is 300-36+110=<<300-36+110=374>>374 miles

How many individual brownies did Greta have ? left over from the entire : day?
                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many brownies Greta made for herself. We know she made a batch of brownies, and a dozen cream cheese swirl brownies are part of that batch. Therefore, the number of brownies Greta made for herself is the sum of the batch size and the number of cream cheese swirl brownies.

Batch size + Cream cheese swirl brownies = Brownies Greta made
(We don't have a specific number for the batch size in the problem, so let's leave it as a variable: X)
X + 12 = Brownies Greta made

Step 2: Next, we need to find out how many brownies Greta got from her office party. We know she received 1/2 a dozen brownies.

Brownies from office party = 1/2 a dozen
= 6 brownies

Step 3: We also know that during her surprise party at home, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Let's find out how many individual brownies that represents.

1 1/2 dozens = 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies

Step 4: Greta had a surprise party at home with her friends, and they brought 4 dozens of brownies. Let's calculate how many individual brownies that represents.

Brownies from friends = 4 dozens
= 4 * 12 = 48 brownies

Step 5: Finally, let's sum up all the brownies Greta had throughout the day and figure out how many are left over.

Total brownies = Brownies Greta made + Brownies from office party + Brownies from friends - Brownies eaten during the party
= (X + 12) + 6 + 48 - 18
= X + 60 - 14

The final answer is: Greta had X + 56 individual brownies left over from the entire day.</s>","Her office sent her home with a 1/2 dozen brownies so she had 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 individual brownies
Her friends had 4 dozen brownies and 1 1/2 dozen were eaten so 4-1.5 = <<4-1.5=2.5>>2.5 dozen brownies left
She made 1 dozen brownies and had 2.5 dozen left from the party so 1+2.5 = <<1+2.5=3.5>>3.5 dozen brownies
Every dozen is 12 and she has 3.5 dozen so she has 12*3.5 = <<12*3.5=42>>42 individuals brownies
She has 42 individual brownies plus the 6 individual brownies sent home from work so she has a total of 42+6 = <<42+6=48>>48 individual brownies

                 [/INST] Let's denote Nani's age as x. According to the problem, Nani is 8 years old and his brother's age is twice Nani's age. So, the age of Nani's brother is 2x.

The problem also states that Nani's sister's age is 25% younger than Nani's age. Therefore, the age of Nani's sister is 0.75x.

Now we want to find the total age of all three family members. So we need to find x, 2x, and 0.75x.

x = 8 (given)
2x = brother's age
0.75x = sister's age

Substituting the value of x from the first equation into the other two equations:

2x = 2 * 8
2x = 16

0.75x = 0.75 * 8
0.75x = 6

So, Nani's brother is 16 years old and Nani's sister is 6 years old.

To find the total age of all three family members add their ages together:

Total age = x + 2x + 0.75x
Total age = 3.75x

Substituting the value of x from the first equation:

Total age = 3.75 * 8
Total age = 30.4 * 1
Total age = 30.4

However, it seems there might be a mistake in the data provided since ages should be in whole numbers, and we have obtained a decimal value for the total age. As a result, the problem statement may not be feasible.

Final answer: {This problem may not be feasible as it results in a total age of 30.4}</s>","Nani's brother is 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 years old.
Nani's sister is 25/100 * 8 = <<25/100*8=2>>2 years younger than he is.
That means she is 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 years old.
In total all mentioned family members, are 16 + 6 + 8 = <<16+6+8=30>>30 years old.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller steps to find out how long it takes Andy to string all the racquets:

1. Andy has 12 racquets to string.
2. He strings 3 with synthetic gut, so that takes 3 * 15 minutes = 45 minutes.
3. He strings 5 with polyester string, so that takes 5 * 22 minutes = 110 minutes.
4. He strings 4 with a hybrid set, so let's find the time for half synthetic gut and half polyester string for one racquet:
   * Half of the racquet is strung with synthetic gut, which takes 7.5 minutes (half of 15 minutes).
   * The other half is strung with polyester string, which takes 9 minutes (half of 18 minutes).
   * So, the total time for one hybrid set is 7.5 + 9 = 16.5 minutes.
5. Therefore, the time it takes Andy to string all 4 racquets with hybrid sets is 4 * 16.5 minutes = 66 minutes.

Let's add up all the times to find out how long it takes Andy to string all the racquets:
45 minutes (synthetic gut) + 110 minutes (polyester string) + 66 minutes (hybrid sets) = 221 minutes or 3 hours and 41 minutes.

{The final answer is: It takes Andy 3 hours and 41 minutes to string all of those racquets.}</s>","Andy is stringing 3 racquets with synthetic gut, so those will take 3 synthetic gut jobs * 15 minutes per synthetic gut job = <<3*15=45>>45 minutes.

1. We know that John is buying one phone for himself, and two phones for his kids and his wife. So in total, John is buying 4 phones.
2. The price of the first two phones is not given, so let's assume their cost is X.
3. Each phone after the first two is half-priced, so the cost of the next two phones is X/2.
4. Therefore, the total cost of the four phones is X + X + (X/2) + (X/2) = 3X/2.
5. We're told the cost of one phone is $600, so X = $600.
6. Substituting X into our equation for the total cost of the four phones, we have 3*($600)/2.
7. Solving this equation, we get the total cost of the four phones being $3,600.

2. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, so she gave away 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 boxes, and 2 boxes contain 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 oranges. Thus, she gave away 40 oranges.
3. The total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington had after giving some to her family is 240 - 40 = <<240-40=200>>200 oranges.
4. She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so she kept 200 * 1/4 = 50 oranges.

                    India has 4 ? more than half the number of states in : the , USA. , What's the total number of states in both countries ! together?
                 [/INST] Step 1: We start with the given information that India has 4 more states than half the number of states in the USA. Here's what we know:

1. India: Number of states = X
2. USA: Number of states = 2 * (number of states in India) - 4

Step 2: We know that India has 4 more states than half the number of states in the USA. Let's find the number of states in India first:

1. If India has 4 more states than half the number of states in the USA, then the number of states in India is (1/2) * number_of_states_in_USA + 4

Step 3: We are given that India has 29 states. Let's double check this:

1. (1/2) * number_of_states_in_USA + 4 = 29
2. Let's solve this equation for number_of_states_in_USA:

   number_of_states_in_USA = 2 * 29 + 8
   number_of_states_in_USA = 58 + 8
   number_of_states_in_USA = 66

Step 4: We have calculated the number of states in the USA based on the given information. Now, let's find the number of states in both countries:

1. India: Number of states = 29
2. USA: Number of states = 66
3. Total number of states in both countries = India's number of states + USA's number of states = 29 + 66 = {95}

The final answer is 95.</s>","Since the number of states in the USA is 50, half that number is 1/2*50 = 25
Since there are 4 more than half the number of states in the USA in India, there are 25+4 = <<4+25=29>>29 states in India.
Together, the two countries have 50+29 = <<50+29=79>>79 states.

                 [/INST] To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we first need to determine how much money he needs in total. Let's calculate the cost of each book:

* Dictionary: $18
* Dinosaur book: $13
* Children's cookbook: $8

The total cost of the books is:

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook)
Total cost = $39

Now, let's see how much money Tyler already has. He has saved $14 from his allowance. So the total amount of money Tyler has is:

Money Tyler has = $14 (savings) + $0 (currently empty)

To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first need to figure out how much more money he needs:

Amount needed = Total cost - Money Tyler has
Amount needed = $39 - $14
Amount needed = $25

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can now calculate the number of hours he needs to work:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5
Hours needed = 5 hours

{The final answer is: Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.}</s>","Tyler wants to purchase books that cost $18 + $13 + $8 = $<<18+13+8=39>>39.
Tyler needs $39 and currently has $14, so he needs to earn $39 - $14 = $<<39-14=25>>25.
Tyler can earn $25 at a rate of $5 per hour by doing 25 / $5 = <<25/5=5>>5 hours of work.

                 [/INST] To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to determine the number of cherries each person has.

Step 1: We know that there are 60 cherries to be shared among Richard, Jerry, and Robert. Robert has 30 cherries.

Step 2: We're told that Jerry has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, the number of cherries Richard has is: 30 (Robert's cherries) - 10 (difference between Jerry and Richard) = 20 cherries.

Step 3: To find the number of cherries Jerry has, we can use the given information that Jerry has 10 more cherries than Richard: Jerry's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10. Substituting the value of Richard's cherries from step 2, we have: Jerry's cherries = 20 cherries + 10 = 30 cherries.

Step 4: Now, to find the difference in the number of cherries between Robert and Jerry, we simply subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from Robert's.

The final answer is: Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 30 cherries, so their cherries are equal. However, Robert was given more information in the question, so the question itself contains an error. To answer the question as stated, we would need different values for the number of cherries each person is given.</s>","Since Robert has 30, then 60 - 30 = <<30=30>>30 cherries are left to be shared by Richard and Jerry.
Richard has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 cherries since Robert has 10 more cherries than him.
Jerry has 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 cherries.
So Robert has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 more cherries than Jerry.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how . much did Sunny earn for two days?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of gingerbread and apple pie boxes sold on Saturday and Sunday.

* On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and X boxes of apple pie.
* On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 boxes of gingerbread.
* The number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday is X + 4, since he sold 4 fewer boxes on Sunday than on Saturday.

Step 2: Calculate the earnings from selling gingerbread and apple pie on each day.

* Gingerbread earnings on Saturday: 10 boxes * $6/box = $60.
* Apple pie earnings on Saturday: X boxes * $15/box = $<<X*15=X15>>X15.
* Gingerbread earnings on Sunday: 15 boxes * $6/box = $90.
* Apple pie earnings on Sunday: (X + 4) boxes * $15/box = $<<(X+4)*15=(X+4)15>>X15 + $60.

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for both days.

* Total gingerbread earnings: $60 (Saturday) + $90 (Sunday) = $<<60+90=150>>150.
* Total apple pie earnings: $X15 (Saturday) + $X15 (Sunday) + $60 = $<<X15+X15+60=2X15>>2X15.

To find the unknown value of X, we need more information. For example, we could find the total number of gingerbread boxes sold over the two days and set up an equation: 10 + 15 = 2X. Solving this equation would give us X = <<10+15=25>>25. With this value, we can find the total earnings:

{The final answer is} Total earnings: $150 (gingerbread) + $525 (apple pie) = $<<150+525=675>>675.</s>","He sold 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.
The total number of boxes of gingerbread that Sunny sold is 10 + 15 = <<10+15=25>>25.
Sunny earned 25 x $6 = $<<25*6=150>>150 for selling gingerbread.
He sold 15 - 4 = <<15-4=11>>11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.
The total number of boxes of apple pie that Sunny sold is 15 + 11 = <<15+11=26>>26.
He earned 26 x $15 = $<<26*15=390>>390 for selling apple pie.
So, Sunny earned $150 + $390 = $<<150+390=540>>540 for two days.

The flower bed is 111 feet long. Each flower grows to be 12 inches wide, and Pat leaves 1.5 feet between every plant. So the width of one plant and the space between two plants is 12 inches + 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 15 inches.

Let's calculate how many flowers can fit along the length of the flower bed.
111 feet * 12 inches/foot * 1 inch/inch * (12 inches/15 inches) = 88 flowers can fit along the length of the flower bed.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 88 - 17 = 71 new flowers.

Petunias cost $3.00 apiece. In one basket, she is going to add 3 petunias. So the cost of petunias in one basket is:
Cost of petunias in one basket = Number of petunias * Cost per petunia
Cost of petunias in one basket = 3 * $3.00
Cost of petunias in one basket = $9.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost of sweet potato vines in one basket.
Sweet potato vines cost $2.50 apiece. In one basket, she is going to add 2 vines. So the cost of sweet potato vines in one basket is:
Cost of sweet potato vines in one basket = Number of sweet potato vines * Cost per sweet potato vine
Cost of sweet potato vines in one basket = 2 * $2.50
Cost of sweet potato vines in one basket = $5.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of filling one basket.
Total cost of one basket = Cost of petunias in one basket + Cost of sweet potato vines in one basket
Total cost of one basket = $9.00 + $5.00
Total cost of one basket = $14.00

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of filling all 5 baskets.
Total cost of filling all baskets = Total cost of one basket * Number of baskets
Total cost of filling all baskets = $14.00 * 5
Total cost of filling all baskets = $70.00

                 [/INST] To determine how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to find the time it takes her to peel and cook 1 minute's worth of shrimp, then multiply that by the number of shrimp needed.

First, let's find out how many shrimp Emily can peel and cook in a minute:

1. Emily can peel 6 shrimp in a minute.

Next, let's find out how long it takes her to sauté 30 shrimp:

2. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.

We'll assume that the peeling and cooking processes are happening in parallel for all 30 shrimp in the pan, meaning it still takes her 1 minute to peel the 6 new shrimp that she's adding to the pan every minute. With this assumption, it would take her an additional 10 minutes to cook all 30 shrimp in the pan since that's the time it took for the last 30 shrimp to cook.

Therefore, the entire process of peeling and cooking 1 minute's worth of shrimp takes 1 minute + 10 minutes = 11 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time it takes her to peel and cook 90 shrimp:

3. It takes Emily 11 minutes to peel and cook 6 shrimp.
4. It takes an additional 10 minutes to cook an extra 24 shrimp (since 90 shrimp is 30 shrimp more than 60 shrimp), as the cooking process can continue while she's peeling and adding new shrimp to the pan.

So, the total time it takes her to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 11 minutes × 2 (for the 2 sets of 6 shrimp) + 10 minutes = 22 minutes.

{The final answer is: It takes Emily 22 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.}</s>","First find how long it takes Emily to peel the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes

Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 10 minutes/batch = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Emily spends: 30 minutes + 15 minutes = <<30+15=45>>45 minutes

How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?
                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's calculate the temperature change during each mode.
- The room cools down at 2 degrees an hour on low.
- The room cools down faster at 3 degrees an hour on high.
- The room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running.

Step 2: Let's calculate the temperature changes during each mode:
1. Low mode (3 hours): The temperature drops by 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.
2. High mode (4 hours): The temperature drops by 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.
3. No air conditioner (2 hours): The temperature rises by 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.

Step 3: The air conditioner was on low for 3 hours, followed by 4 hours on high and then turned off for 2 hours. Therefore, the total cooling effect is 6 degrees (low) + 12 degrees (high) = 18 degrees. Additionally, the room warmed up by 4 degrees when the air conditioner was off.

Step 4: To find the final temperature, we need to subtract the cooling effect and the room warming during the no-AC period from the starting temperature. We don't have the starting temperature in the problem statement.

The final answer is: {It is impossible to find the final temperature as we don't have the starting temperature}.</s>","The air conditioner ran for 3 hours on low, so the temperature dropped 2 * 3 = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees.
It then ran for 4 hours on high, so the temperature dropped another 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 degrees.
It was then turned off for 2 hours, so the temperature rose 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 degrees.
Thus, the final temperature was 6 + 12 - 4 = <<6+12-4=14>>14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

                 [/INST] To find out when Bill saw the Comet for the first time, we need to determine the number of orbits the comet made between the time his father saw it and the time Bill saw it.

1. We know Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was at the time.

Let X be the number of orbits between the time Bill's father saw the Comet and the time Bill saw it.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years:

X = Number of Orbits = T (in years) / Orbit Period

Where T is the time difference in years between the two observations.

1) Calculate the time difference T:

T = (Bill's age at second observation) - (Father's age at first observation)

T = (3 * Father's age at first observation) - (Father's age at first observation)

T = 2 * Father's age at first observation

2) Substitute T in the equation for number of orbits X:

X = T / Orbit Period

X = (2 * Father's age at first observation) / Orbit Period

Given that Father's age at first observation is 30 years:

X = (2 * 30) / 75

X = 4/3

However, since a fraction of a number of orbits is not possible, there must be an error in the given information or the problem statement itself is incorrect. As the problem stands, Bill's father would have had to have seen the comet when he was 0 years old for Bill to have seen it when he was three times his father's age.

The final answer is: The problem is inconsistent with the given information. Please check the provided information for any errors.</s>","Bill saw the Comet for the second time when he was 30 years * 3= <<30*3=90>>90 years old.

1. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes each day as X. So, the number of flights to Greece is 3/4 * X.
2. The remaining flights of the first plane are split equally between France and Germany. Since these flights are half the number of flights to Greece, the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (1/2) * X.
3. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and it makes 44 trips. Since the number of trips the first plane makes is X, the number of trips the second plane makes is 44.
4. To find the difference between the total number of trips the first plane makes and the number of trips it makes to Greece, we can subtract the number of flights to Greece from X: X - (3/4) * X = X (1 - 3/4) = X/4.
5. The number of trips to France of the first plane is (1/2) * X/4 = (1/8) * X.

{The final answer is: (1/8) * X flights to France for the first plane per day.}

This answer shows that the first plane flies (1/8) X times to France each day.

Therefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 flights to France or Germany.
Splitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 flights to France in one day.

                    question:
                    ! Four children are . playing together—Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and : the total age of the children is 20. If Akbar is 3 years . old and Alessandro is 4 years ! old, calculate . the . age of Wilfred.
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the average age of the group.
The average age of the group is calculated by dividing the total age of all children by the number of children.
Total age of children = Age of Akbar + Age of Alessandro + Age of Helene + Age of Wilfred
Total age of children = 3 + 4 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age

The average age of the group is:
Average age = Total age of children / Number of children
Average age = (3 +4+ Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4

Step 2: Find Helene's age.
We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. So Helene's age = 2 * Average age

Step 3: Solve for Helene's age.
Helene's age = 2 * ( (3+4+Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4 )
2 * ( Total age / number of children ) = Helene's age
2 * ( (3+4+Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4 ) = Helene's age

Multiplying both sides by 4:
2 * ( Total age ) = 4 * Helene's age
2 * ( 3 + 4 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age ) = 4 * Helene's age

Step 4: Solve for Helene's age using the given information that the total age of the children is 20.
Substituting Total age = 20 into the equation:
2 * ( 20 ) = 4 * Helene's age
40 = 4 * Helene's age

Divide both sides by 4:
Helene's age = 10

Step 5: Find Wilfred's age.
We know that Helene's age is 10, and Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. So, the average age of the group is:
Average age = Age of group / 4 = (3+4+10+Wilfred's age) / 4
Average age = (17 + Wilfred's age) / 4

We can find Wilfred's age by finding twice the average age and then subtracting Akbar's and Alessandro's ages:
Helene's age = 2 * Average age => 10 = 2 * ( (17 + Wilfred's age) / 4 )
10 = (17 + Wilfred's age) / 2
10 * 2 = 17 + Wilfred's age
20 = 17 + Wilfred's age
Wilfred's age = 20 - 17 = 3

{The final answer is Wilfred is 3 years old.}</s>","If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.
Helene is twice as old as the group's average age, meaning Helene is 2 * 5 years = <<2*5=10>>10 years old.
The total age of the three children is 10 years + 3 years + 4 years = <<10+3+4=17>>17 years.
Wilfred's age is 20 years - 17 years = <<20-17=3>>3 years.

So, everyone else has donated $2000 in total. now we can find the contribution of Walter lawyer:

Step 6: Walter's lawyer is going to donate an amount equal to three times what everyone else has donated.
Step 7: So, his lawyer's contribution will be 3 * $2000 = $6000

Each guest brought 15 cookies, and there were 100 guests.
Total cookies = Number of guests * Cookies per guest
Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest
Total cookies = 1500 cookies

Step 2: Find the number of cookies given to the church.
The bride gave half of the cookies to the church.
Number of cookies for the church = Total cookies / 2
Number of cookies for the church = 1500 cookies / 2
Number of cookies for the church = 750 cookies

Step 3: Find the number of people in the church next door if each person gets 15 cookies.
The number of people in the church next door is equal to the number of cookies given to them divided by the number of cookies each person gets.
Number of people in the church next door = Cookies for the church / Cookies per person
Number of people in the church next door = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person
Number of people in the church next door ≈ 50 people

                    A family of 6 (2 : adults and 4 kids) are to divide a watermelon such that each adult gets a , slice that is : twice as big as that of each kid. What percentage of the watermelon does each adult get?
                 [/INST] To find out how much percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we first need to determine how many slices there are for the adults and kids in total, and then find the percentage of the total number of slices that the adults get.

1. We have 2 adults and 4 kids in the family, making a total of 6 people.
2. Each kid gets one slice. So, there are 4 slices for the kids.
3. Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as a kid's slice. Therefore, each adult gets 2 slices (the same number as a kid but with larger sizes).
4. Thus, there are 2 slices for each adult, and a total of 2 * 2 = 4 slices for the adults.
5. In total, there are 4 slices for kids + 4 slices for adults = 8 slices for the whole family.

Now, to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we first need to find the percentage of the total number of slices that the adults' slices represent:

1. The adults represent 2 adults and therefore 2 adults' share of slices.
2. We have already found that there are 4 slices for the adults.
3. To find the percentage of the total number of slices that the adults' slices represent, we'll divide the number of adults' slices by the total number of slices and multiply by 100: (4 / 8) * 100

The final answer is: Each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.</s>","Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.
Since each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon
So the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage
The percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)
x = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

How , many hours ? will Doctor Jones . have . left to update his records ; if he has 9 inpatients at the clinic?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the time Doctor Jones spends on rounds.
Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients at the clinic and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient to do rounds.
Time spent on rounds = Number of inpatients * Time per inpatient
Time spent on rounds = 9 * 20
Time spent on rounds = 180 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time Doctor Jones spends on appointments.
Doctor Jones has 10 appointments and each appointment takes 30 minutes.
Time spent on appointments = Number of appointments * Time per appointment
Time spent on appointments = 10 * 30
Time spent on appointments = 300 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on Monday at the clinic.
Total time spent at the clinic = Time spent on rounds + Time spent on appointments
Total time spent at the clinic = 180 + 300
Total time spent at the clinic = 480 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the time Doctor Jones spends on updating his records.
Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic, and we know that 1 hour = 60 minutes.
Number of hours Doctor Jones spends updating records = Doctor's hours at the clinic / Hours per hour
Number of hours Doctor Jones spends updating records = 9 / 1
Number of hours Doctor Jones spends updating records = 9
Number of minutes Doctor Jones spends updating records = 9 * 60
Number of minutes Doctor Jones spends updating records = 540 minutes

Step 5: Calculate the number of hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records.
Hours left to update records = Total time Doctor Jones has on Monday at the clinic - Time spent on rounds - Time spent on appointments - Time spent on records update
Hours left to update records = 480 - 180 - 300 - 540
Hours left to update records = -720

However, this result doesn't make sense as it indicates that Doctor Jones has less than zero hours available. It is an indication that Doctor Jones' time schedule does not allow him to complete all his tasks (rounds, appointments, and updating records) within the given time frame. {The final answer is that Doctor Jones does not have enough hours to complete all his tasks for Monday and the schedule may need to be adjusted.}</s>","Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients, so his rounds will take 9 * 20 = <<9*20=180>>180 minutes.
He has ten appointments, which will take 10 * 30 = <<10*30=300>>300 minutes.
The rounds and appointments will take 180 + 300 = <<180+300=480>>480 minutes total.
An hour is 60 minutes, so rounds and appointments will take 480 / 60 = <<480/60=8>>8 hours.
Doctor Jones will have 9 - 8 = <<9-8=1>>1 hour left to update his records.

                 [/INST] To find the latest time of day that Jordan can start baking the cake to serve it at 5:00 pm, we need to account for the time it takes to make the batter, bake the cake, cool it, and frost it.

1. First, let's find out how long it takes to make the batter and bake the cake. That's a total of 20 minutes for making the batter and 30 minutes for baking, so it takes 50 minutes.

2. The cake then needs to cool for 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

3. After cooling, it takes an additional 10 minutes to frost the cake.

4. To find the latest time of day Jordan can start making the cake, we'll add up all the times:

Latest starting time = Time to cool and frost the cake + Time to bake and make the batter + Buffer time (to account for potential delays during baking, cooling, and frosting)

Latest starting time = 120 minutes + 50 minutes + Buffer time

Let's assume a buffer time of 30 minutes to account for potential delays:

Latest starting time = 120 + 50 + 30 = 200 minutes

5. Convert minutes to hours:

Latest starting time = 200 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours and 20 minutes

Therefore, {The latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 3 hours and 20 minutes before 5:00 pm, which is noon.}</s>","1 hour is 60 minutes so we know that 2 hours to cool the cake is the same as 2*60 so <<2*60=120>>120 min

                 [/INST] To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to find out how many chocolate bars Lisa and Peter sold in total and then divide that number by the number of boxes they sold.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars Lisa sold. We know she sold 3 and a half boxes, so:

Lisa's chocolate bars = Number of boxes * Chocolates per box
=\> 3.5 boxes * Chocolates per box

Since we don't know the exact number of chocolates per box yet, let's denote it as ""x"". We can write the equation for Lisa's chocolate bars:

Lisa's chocolate bars = 3.5 * x

Next, we find out how many chocolate bars Peter sold. We know he sold 4 boxes and a half, so:

Peter's chocolate bars = Number of boxes * Chocolates per box + Chocolates in half box
=\> 4 boxes * x + 0.5 * x

Now, we know they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars together:

Total chocolate bars = Lisa's chocolate bars + Peter's chocolate bars
= (3.5 * x) + (4 * x + 0.5 * x)

Substituting the terms we already know:

64 = (3.5 * x) + (5.5 * x)

Combining the terms:

64 = 7.5 * x

Dividing both sides by 7.5:

x = 64 / 7.5
x ≈ 8.57

Since the number of chocolates in a box must be a whole number, we made an error, and there's a mistake in the problem. The number of chocolates in a box cannot be an approximation of 8.57.

We suggest checking the given information or reaching out to the person who provided it to get the correct number of chocolates in a box.</s>","Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.
Lisa sold 3 1/2 * B bars.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of renting the studio per week.
The cost to rent the studio is $25 per session, and the studio is rented 3 days a week. Therefore, the weekly cost of renting the studio is $25 * 3 = $<<25*3=75>>75.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of having 10 students per session.
The cost per student is $1.50, and there are 10 students in total per session. Therefore, the cost of having 10 students is $1.50 * 10 = $<<1.5*10=15>>15.

Step 3: Calculate the weekly cost including both studio rental and student fees.
The weekly cost of having 10 students and renting the studio is $75 + $15 = $<<75+15=90>>90.

Step 4: Calculate the number of sessions per week.
Since there are 3 days a week that the studio is rented, and each session has 10 students, there are a total of 3 sessions per week.

Step 5: Calculate the monthly cost of renting the studio.
There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly cost of renting the studio is $90 * 4 = $<<90*4=360>>360.

Step 6: Calculate the monthly income from having 10 students per session.
Since there are 3 sessions per week and 10 students per session, there are a total of 30 students (10 students/session * 3 sessions/week) per month. The income from having these 30 students is $15 per student * 30 students = $<<15*30=450>>450.

Step 7: Calculate the expected monthly earnings.
The expected monthly earnings of the dance studio are the monthly cost of renting the studio plus the monthly income from having students. Therefore, the expected monthly earnings are $360 + $450 = $<<360+450=810>>810. {The final answer is $810.}</s>","The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.

Thus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.
Therefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.

1. Peter has 4 boxes with an equal number of chocolate bars. The total number of chocolate bars Peter has is 64. So, the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter is:
   Number of chocolate bars in one Peter's box = Total chocolate bars (Peter) / Number of boxes
   Number of chocolate bars in one Peter's box = 64 / 4
   Number of chocolate bars in one Peter's box = 16

2. Martha has 7 boxes with an equal number of chocolate bars. The total number of chocolate bars Martha has is 56. So, the number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha is:
   Number of chocolate bars in one Martha's box = Total chocolate bars (Martha) / Number of boxes
   Number of chocolate bars in one Martha's box = 56 / 7
   Number of chocolate bars in one Martha's box = 8

3. To find the difference in the number of chocolate bars between each of Peter's boxes and each of Martha's boxes, subtract the number of chocolate bars in one Martha's box from the number of chocolate bars in one Peter's box:
   Difference in chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars in one Peter's box - Number of chocolate bars in one Martha's box
   Difference in chocolate bars = 16 - 8
   Difference in chocolate bars = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box compared to Martha.

50 * (3/5) = 30

Step 2: Calculate the number of babies born by all female porcupines in a year.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, so the number of babies born in a year is:
30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

Step 3: Find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year.
The initial population was 50, and 1440 babies were born during the year, so the total population after a year is:
50 + 1440 = 1495

{The final answer is: There will be 1495 porcupines in the park after a year.}</s>","The number of female porcupines in the park is 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30.

How much will it cost to fill the pool?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
The volume of a rectangular pool can be calculated using the following formula:
Volume = Length * Width * Depth

Substitute the given dimensions into the formula:
Volume = 25 ft * 14 ft * 4 ft

Step 2: Convert cubic feet to gallons.
We know that 1 cubic foot is equal to approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, to convert cubic feet to gallons, we need to multiply the volume by 7.48.

Volume in gallons = Volume in cubic feet * Conversion Factor
Volume in gallons = (25 ft * 14 ft * 4 ft) * 7.48 gal/ft³

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water needed.
We are also told that we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the amount of water needed.

Total water needed = Volume in gallons * 5.9
Total water needed = [(25 ft * 14 ft * 4 ft) * 7.48 gal/ft³] * 5.9

Step 4: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.
Finally, we can multiply the total water needed by the cost per gallon to find the total cost.

Total cost = Total water needed * Cost per gallon
Total cost = [[(25 ft * 14 ft * 4 ft) * 7.48 gal/ft³] * 5.9] * $0.10/gal

As a sanity check, let's calculate the final answer in a step-by-step manner:
- Volume in cubic feet: 25 ft * 14 ft * 4 ft = 1,340 ft³
- Volume in gallons: 1,340 ft³ * 7.48 gal/ft³ = 9,858.52 gal
- Total water needed: 9,858.52 gal * 5.9 = 58,055.82 gal
- Total cost: $0.10/gal * 58,055.82 gal = $5,805.58

{The final answer is: $5,805.58}</s>","Mr. Smith found the volume of the pool to be 14 feet wide x 25 feet long x 4 feet deep = <<14*25*4=1400>>1,400 cubic feet

Total amount of water pumped on Day 2 by both Wanda and Ms. B: 2733 + 1125 = 3858 gallons

Total amount of water pumped by both Wanda and Ms. B over the two days: 7875 + 3858 = 11,733 gallons

The tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. So, the remaining water needed to fill the tank is:

                 [/INST] To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria left for the park, we need to find out the total capacity of the power bank and how much charge was left at the end of her 5 hours and 3 hours of charging her friends' phones. Let's break this down step by step:

Step 1: Understanding the percentage of charge lost per hour.
Maria's power bank lost 9% each hour for the first 5 hours and 7% each hour for the next 3 hours.

Step 2: Calculating the amount of charge lost during each period.
First, let's find out how much charge was lost when Maria charged her friends' phones for 5 hours:
5 hours * 9% = 45%

Now, let's find out how much charge was lost when she charged her friends' phones for 3 hours:
3 hours * 7% = 21%

Step 3: Determining the total charge lost during both periods.
Total charge lost = 45% + 21% = 66%

Step 4: Calculating the percentage of charge remaining at the end.
The power bank had a total loss of 66%, meaning that there were 34% of the charges left:
Charges remaining = 34%

Step 5: Solving for the initial charge.
Let's denote X as the initial charge of the power bank. We know that the final charge is X * 0.34. We're looking for the value of X. We can rewrite the equation as:
X = X * 0.34

To find X, we can divide both sides by 0.34:
X = X / 0.34

To get rid of X in the denominator, we can multiply both sides by 1:
X = X * (1 / 0.34)

X = X * (0.3029)

Now we cannot get the exact value of X without more information (e.g., the total capacity of the power bank). The percentage of charge lost might vary from power bank to power bank, so without knowing its exact capacity, it's impossible to calculate an accurate answer.

The final answer is: Insufficient information to determine the initial charge of the power bank.</s>","At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.
Later on, the power bank lost 7% per hour * 3 hours = 21%.
The power bank charge remaining was 28%, so the power bank charge before going to the park was 45 + 21 +28 = 94%.

Step 1: Calculate Janet's weekly income:
Janet makes $10 per hour from wages and works 40 hours a week.
Her weekly wage income is $10/hour * 40 hours = $400.

Step 2: Calculate Janet's weekly tip income:
Janet makes $15 per hour from tips.

Step 3: Calculate Janet's total weekly income:
Total weekly income = Wage income + Tip income
Total weekly income = $400 + $15 * 40
Total weekly income = $400 + $600
Total weekly income = $1,000

Step 4: Calculate how much Janet saves each week:
Janet wants to save 20% of her total weekly income for a down payment.
Savings per week = 0.2 * $1,000 = $200.

Step 5: Calculate how many weeks it will take to save the down payment:
Number of weeks = Savings needed / Savings per week
Number of weeks = $10,000 / $200
Number of weeks = 50.

{The final answer is: Janet will need to work for 50 weeks to save the down payment for the $10,000 car.}</s>","She makes 10+15=$<<10+15=25>>25 an hour from working

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the amount of money Jamaar has left to spend after purchasing the fruits he already had.
Since Jamaar purchased 3 peaches at $0.5 each, 4 pears at $0.5 each, 2 kiwis at $1 each, and 5 apples at $0.75 each:

3 peaches * $0.5/peach = $1.5
4 pears * $0.5/pear = $2.0
2 kiwis * $1/kiwi = $2.0
5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Total amount spent = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Since Jamaar had $10 initially and spent $9.25, he has $0.75 left.

Step 2: Calculate how many plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining amount.
The price of each plum is $0.25.

Number of plums = Remaining amount / Price per plum

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. Anne purchased 15 packs of sweets, and there are 60 pieces in each pack.
2. So, the total number of pieces Anne bought is 15 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces.
3. Anne kept 2 packs, so she gave away 13 packs (15 total packs minus 2 kept packs).
4. Anne gave each of her 10 friends an equal number of pieces. Let x be the number of pieces each friend received.
5. Since there are 13 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces Anne gave away is 13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces.
6. To find out how many pieces each friend received, divide the total number of pieces she gave away by the number of friends: 780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces/friend.

{The final answer is each friend received 78 pieces of sweets.}</s>","After Anne kept 2 packs, there were only 15 - 2 = <<15-2=13>>13 packs left.
Therefore, there were 13 x 60 = <<13*60=780>>780 pieces of sweets left.
So, each of her 10 friends received 780 / 10 = <<780/10=78>>78 pieces of sweets.

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes him to read one page, divide the number of pages by the time it takes to read them.

Time per page = Total time / Number of pages
Time per page = 10 minutes / 3 pages
Time per page ≈ 3.33 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes James to read 18 pages.
Time to read 18 pages = Time per page * Number of pages
Time to read 18 pages = 3.33 minutes/page * 18 pages
Time to read 18 pages = 60 minutes

Step 3: Add the time James spends reading to the time he goes to bed to find his total reading time.
Total reading time = Time to read 18 pages + Time spent before bed

Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed ! animals as large , ones , and earned $120 from the sales. Each . small stuffed animal ? costs : $4. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is $4 * 3 = $12.

2. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, and she earned $120 from the sales. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold as x, and the number of large stuffed animals she sold as y. We can set up a system of equations:
   x = 2y
   $12x + $12y = $120

3. To solve the system of equations, we can first solve for y in terms of x from the first equation: y = x/2.

4. Now, we can substitute y in the second equation: $12x + $12(x/2) = $120. Multiplying every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get: $24x + $12x = $240.

5. Combining like terms, we have $36x = $240. Dividing both sides by $36, we get x = $7.

6. However, x represents the number of small stuffed animals, and since each small stuffed animal costs $4, Teresa actually sold x = $7 * $4 = ≤ 28 small stuffed animals.

7. Since we can't sell a fraction of a stuffed animal, Teresa must have sold a multiple of 4 small stuffed animals. The closest multiple less than or equal to $7 is 4, so Teresa sold at least 4 small stuffed animals.

8. Therefore, we need to find the number of small stuffed animals that Teresa sold in multiples of 4, such that twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones were sold. We know that the price difference between a small and large stuffed animal is $8 ($12 - $4). Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so if she sold 4n small stuffed animals, then she sold 2n large stuffed animals. The total revenue would be $120 for this configuration: $12(4n) + $8(2n) = $120.

9. By solving for n in the equation above, we get n = 1. Therefore, Teresa could have sold 4 small stuffed animals (at a cost of $16) and 2 large stuffed animals (at a cost of $12 each, for a total of $12 * 2 = $24), but this doesn't equal the total revenue of $120 that was stated in the problem. However, it's possible that Teresa made an error and sold $120 worth of large stuffed animals instead of $120 total sales. In this case, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is at least 4.

Therefore, {The final answer is: Teresa sold at least 4 small stuffed animals}.</s>","Let A be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.
Thus, she sold 2A small stuffed animals.
Large stuffed animals cost 3 * 4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.
She earned 12A + 4 * 2A = 12A + 8A = 20A = $120 from selling stuffed animals today.
Thus, she sold A = 120 / 20 = <<120/20=6>>6 large stuffed animals today.
Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, so she sold 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 small stuffed animals today.

                    question:
                    A store offers sandwiches , in 3 different package sizes: the ? first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the second with 4 sandwiches for $6, and a ; third with 8 sandwiches, but ! the price is not indicated. Knowing , that ; the , prices are : proportional, how : much will the package with 8 sandwiches ! cost?
                 [/INST] To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the given information that the prices are proportional. Let's first find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that information to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

1. Price per sandwich for the 2-sandwich package: $3 / 2 sandwiches = $₁₇⁄₇ $1.71 per sandwich.
2. Price per sandwich for the 4-sandwich package: $6 / 4 sandwiches = $₁ₕ⁄₆ $1.00 per sandwich.

From this information, it's clear that the price per sandwich decreases as the number of sandwiches in the package increases. Since the prices are proportional, we can find the cost of the 8-sandwich package by finding the price per sandwich for this package and then multiplying it by 8.

Let x be the price per sandwich for the 8-sandwich package. Based on the pattern we've observed, we can assume that x < $1.00 to maintain the proportional relationship.

We know that:
- $1.71 = 2 * x
- $1.00 = 4 * x

We can set up the following system of equations to solve for x:

1.71 * 2 = 2 * x
-> 3.42 = 2x
-> x = ³⅖₁³ $1.71 / ² $0.86 (approximately)

Now we can find the cost of the 8-sandwich package:

Cost of 8-sandwich package = 8 * x
-> Cost of 8-sandwich package = 8 * $¹⅖₁³
-> Cost of 8-sandwich package = $6.03 (approximately)

The final answer is $6.03 for the package with 8 sandwiches.</s>","So the price for 1 sandwich is $3 / 2 sandwiches = $<<3/2=1.5>>1.5/sandwich
Now the price for the package with 8 sandwiches would be $1.5/sandwich * 8 sandwiches = $<<1.5*8=12>>12

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000.  He sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the bedroom set.  He then has to ! pay 10% a month for the bedroom : set.  How much ; does he have to pay . per month?
                 [/INST] First, let's find out how much Tom paid for the bedroom set in total. We know he paid $1000 from the sale of his old bedroom set, so the rest was paid in payments. The total cost of the bedroom set is $3000, so:

Total cost of bedroom set = $3000
Payment made from old bedroom set sale = $1000

Remaining amount to be paid = Total cost of bedroom set - Payment made
= $3000 - $1000
= $2900

Next, we need to calculate how much Tom pays per month for the bedroom set under a 10% monthly financing rate. To do this, we will use the formula for a loan payment, which is:

Payment = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n-1]

where:
P = loan amount
r = monthly interest rate
n = number of payments

In this case, the loan amount P is $2900, the monthly interest rate r is 0.10 (10%), and we need to find the n, the number of payments. To find the number of payments, we need to determine how long Tom is going to be paying for the bedroom set. Let's assume Tom pays off the bedroom set in 3 years (36 months).

So now we have:

Payment = P [r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n-1]

Substitute the values:

Payment = $2900 [0.10(1+0.10)^36]/[(1+0.10)^36-1]

Calculate the value inside the square brackets:

Expression inside square brackets = (1 + 0.10)^36 - 1 ≈ 2.488721

Now we can substitute into the original formula:

Payment = $2900 [0.10(2.488721)]/[2.488721-1]

Calculate the numerator:

Numerator = $2900 [0.10(2.488721)] ≈ $896.61

Now we can calculate the payment amount:

Payment = $896.61

So the final answer is: Tom has to pay approximately $896.61 per month.</s>","He has to pay 3000-1000=$<<3000-1000=2000>>2000
So he has to pay 2000*.1=$<<2000*.1=200>>200 per month

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the initial number of each color balloon.
Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. So in total, she had 25 + 7 + 12 = <<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.

Step 2: Calculate how many red balloons burst.
40% of the red balloons burst, so that's 0.4 * 25 = <<0.4*25=10>>10 red balloons that burst.

Step 3: Calculate the number of yellow balloons that were released.
Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She had 12 yellow balloons, so half of them were released, which is 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 yellow balloons.

Step 4: Calculate the number of blue balloons Sally found and added.
Sally found 8 blue balloons. She added 75% of them to her remaining balloons, so the number of blue balloons she carried was 8 + 0.75 * 8 = <<8+0.75*8=11>>11 balloons.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school.
Sally carried red balloons (25 - 10 = <<25-10=15>>15), green balloons (7 unchanged), yellow balloons (12 - 6 = <<12-6=6>>6), and blue balloons (8 + 11 = <<8+11=19>>19). In total, she carried 15 + 7 + 6 + 19 = <<15+7+6+19=42>>42 balloons into the school.

{The final answer is 42 balloons.}</s>","Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons

                 [/INST] To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to find the probability that none of the given events occur and he has to turn in his homework. Let's calculate the probabilities step by step.

1. The probability that Marcus doesn't have a substitute teacher and the normal teacher isn't giving an extension is:
P(Substitute teacher not appearing) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5
P(Normal teacher not giving an extension) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6

So, the probability that neither of these events occur is:
P(Neither a substitute teacher nor an extension) = P(Substitute teacher not appearing) * P(Normal teacher not giving an extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

2. However, if the dog eating the assignment event occurs, Marcus gets a personal extension.
The probability that Marcus' dog eats his assignment is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Marcus turns in his homework tomorrow is the complement of the probability that none of the events occur and he gets an extension:

The final answer is:
1 - P(neither a substitute teacher nor an extension nor dog event) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 or 70%</s>","First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%
Then find the chance the teacher doesn't grant the whole class an extension by subtracting the chance she does from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%
Then find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%
Now find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3
Now multiply that probability by the probability Marcus can't get a personal extension to find the probability he actually has to turn in his homework: .3 * .8 = <<.3*.8=.24>>.24

                 [/INST] To find out how many tickets each graduate will receive, we first need to find out how many seats are available for guests. 

1. The Fine Arts Center has a seating capacity of 6000 people.
2. There are 950 seats for graduates.
3. There are 300 seats for faculty attending.

So the number of seats available for guests is:

Total seats - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
= 6000 - 950 - 300
= 5650

Now we need to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive, assuming the tickets are split equally among the remaining seats for guests:

Total seats for guests / Number of graduates
= 5650 / Number of graduates

Let's denote the number of graduates as x:

5650 = 5650 * (1 / x)

To find the value of x, we can simplify the equation:

5650 = 1 / x
x = 1 / (5650)
x ≈ 0.001766
x ≈ 1766 graduates

So there are approximately 1766 graduates.

To find the number of tickets each graduate will receive, we can use the initial equation:

5650 = 5650 * (1 / x)
5650 = 5650 / x
5650 = 5650 / 1766

The number of tickets each graduate will receive is approximately:
5650 / 1766 ≈ 3.21
Since each graduate cannot receive a fraction of a ticket, we round down to the nearest whole number:

{The final answer is, approximately, 3 tickets per graduate.}</s>","Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates
Minus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 6000 - 1250 = <<6000-1250=4750>>4750 remaining seats.
Divide amount of graduates by remaining seats. 4750/950 = <<4750/950=5>>5 tickets

2. We are told that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. So, the number of medium-sized beans is:
   Medium beans = 2 * Large beans = 2 * 75 = 150

3. Now we need to find out how many small beans are equivalent to one medium-sized bean. We're told that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, the conversion factor is 3 small beans for 1 medium bean:

4. To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to find out how many small beans are in 150 medium beans:
   Small beans = Medium beans * Conversion factor = 150 * 3 = 450

                    question:
                    Jim decides to ! go to college to earn some more money. ;  . It takes him 4 years to finish and he gets $50,000 in loans per year.  If : he had a 25k a year job before college and his college degree tripled his income, how long would it take to ; earn the money equivalent to . the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.
                 [/INST] To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. First, let's find out how much Jim's college degree increased his income by. Before college, he was making $25,000 per year. After college, his income tripled, so:
   New income = $25,000 * 3
   New income = $75,000 per year

2. Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned during his 4 years in college. Since he lost $25,000 each year by not working, and his income after college was $75,000 per year:
   Total money lost during college = 4 * $25,000
   Total money lost during college = $100,000

3. Let's also calculate how much he took out in student loans during those 4 years. We know he took out $50,000 per year, so:
   Total student loans = 4 * $50,000
   Total student loans = $200,000

4. In order to find out how long it would take Jim to earn the same amount of money he lost during college plus the amount he took out in loans, we need to determine his new annual income after paying off his student loans. Let's assume he pays off his loans with a fixed monthly payment over a certain number of years (N), and his monthly payment is P:

   Total student loans = $200,000
   Loans paid off = 0

   Monthly loan payment = P
   while Loans paid off < $200,000:
       Loans paid off += Monthly loan payment
       Total debt -= Monthly loan payment
       New monthly income = Total income - Monthly loan payment
       if New monthly income < Monthly loan payment:
           break

5. Once we find out the monthly loan payment (P), we can determine how many months it would take Jim to pay off his student loans. Let's also find out his new annual income after paying off his loans:

   New annual income = New monthly income * 12

6. Now, we need to find how long it would take Jim to earn the amount equal to the money he lost during college plus the amount he took out in student loans:

   Total amount to be earned = $100,000 (lost money during college) + $200,000 (student loans)
   Total amount to be earned = $300,000

7. Finally, we can calculate how many years it would take Jim to earn this amount with his new income:

   New annual income = ...
   Years to earn total amount = Total amount to be earned / New annual income

I'll leave the calculations in steps 4 to 7 for you to complete since the information given is not precise enough to determine the exact numbers. However, this step-by-step process should help you understand how to solve the problem.

{The final answer is: The number of years it would take Jim to earn back the money he lost during college and paid in student loans depends on his new annual income, which can be determined by finding the monthly loan payment first.}</s>","His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year
So he earns an extra 75,000-25,000=$<<75000-25000=50000>>50,000 a year
His loan cost 50,000*4=$<<50000*4=200000>>200,000
He lost out on 25,000*4=$<<25000*4=100000>>100,000 from not working
So he needs to make 200,000+100,000=$<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000

                 [/INST] To find out how many square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy, we first need to determine the size of each piece of fabric.

Step 1: Find the dimensions of the fabric pieces.
Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

Longer dimension: 6 ft (bed length) + 2 ft = 8 ft
Wider dimension: 8 ft (bed width) + 2 ft = 10 ft

So, each piece of fabric has the following dimensions: 8 ft by 10 ft.

Step 2: Find the area of one piece of fabric.
Area is calculated by multiplying the length and the width.

Area of one fabric piece = 8 ft * 10 ft = 80 ft²

Step 3: Find the total area of fabric Jim needs.
Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area he needs is the area of one piece multiplied by the number of pieces.

Total area of fabric = 80 ft²/piece * 2 pieces = 160 ft²

{The final answer is: Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.}</s>","First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet
Then find the width of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's width: 8 feet + 2 feet = <<8+2=10>>10 feet
Then find the square footage of each piece of fabric by multiplying its length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet
Then double that amount since Jim needs two pieces of fabric: 80 square feet/piece * 2 pieces = <<80*2=160>>160 square feet

Letters delivered on Monday = 425
Letters delivered on Tuesday = 1/5 * Letters delivered on Monday + 17

Step 1.1: Find one-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday:

1/5 * 425 = 85

So, the post office delivered 85 letters on Tuesday.

Step 2: Let's find out how many letters were delivered on Wednesday. We know that on Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they did on Tuesday. So, we need to find twice as many letters as were delivered on Tuesday and then add 5:

Letters delivered on Tuesday = 85
Letters delivered on Wednesday = 2 * Letters delivered on Tuesday + 5

Step 2.1: Find twice as many letters as were delivered on Tuesday:

2 * 85 = 170

So, the post office delivered 170 letters on Wednesday.

Step 3: Find the total number of letters delivered Monday - Wednesday:

Total letters delivered = Letters delivered on Monday + Letters delivered on Tuesday + Letters delivered on Wednesday

Total letters delivered = 425 + 85 + 170

Total letters delivered = 640

                 [/INST] Let's denote the amount of money that Johnny's dad bet on the first race as x. He lost $5 on the first race, so:

x = -$5

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so:

$ won on the second race = 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9 + $1 = -$8

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So,

$ lost on the third race = 1.5 * ($ won on the second race) = 1.5 * ($-8) = -$12

Now, we need to find out how much money Johnny's dad lost on average that day. We can calculate this by summing up the amounts of money he lost on each race and then dividing the total loss by the number of races he participated in:

Total loss = $ lost on the first race + $ lost on the second race + $ lost on the third race
Total loss = -$5 - $8 - $12
Total loss = -$25

There were three races, so Johnny's dad participated in a total of three races:

Average loss per race = Total loss / Number of races
Average loss per race = -$25 / 3

Since we're looking for the absolute value of the average loss per race, we must take the value with the sign changed:

Step 1: Find the population of one city.
There are 1000 people living in each city.

Step 2: Find the population of one country.
There are 5 cities in each country, and each city has a population of 1000 people. So, the population of one country is:
Population of one country = Number of cities in a country * Population of one city
Population of one country = 5 cities * 1000 people/city
Population of one country = 5000 people

Step 3: Find the total population in South America.
There are 26 countries in South America, so the total population is:

According to the problem, we know:
1. X + Y + Z = $1920 (The total amount is divided among three people)
2. Y = X + $80 (The second person took $80 more than the first)
3. Z = 2Y (The third person took twice what the second person took)

Now, let's solve for X!:

First, we'll find the expressions for Y and Z in terms of X:
From the given conditions, we know that Y = X + $80 and Z = 2Y.
Substituting Y = X + $80 into the expression Z = 2Y, we get Z = 2(X + $80).

Simplifying the expression for Z:
Z = 2X + $160

Now, we can find the expression for Y in terms of X:
Y = X + $80

Substituting Y = X + $80 into the original equation X + (X+$80)+ (2X+$160) = $1920,
we can solve for X:
3X + $240 = $1920
$240 = $1680 - 3X

Step 1: Determine the number of hours in a day.
Given that the painters worked for 3/8ths of a day, we can calculate the number of hours in a day as follows:

1 day = 24 hours
Then, 3/8ths of a day = (3/8)*24 hours = 9 hours

Therefore, the painters worked for 9 hours every day.

Step 2: Determine the total hours of work done by all the painters in three weeks.
We know that there are 7 days in a week. So, in three weeks, the painters worked for:

Total hours of work = Number of hours worked per day * Number of days in three weeks
Total hours of work = 9 hours/day * 21 days (3 weeks * 7 days)
Total hours of work = 189 hours

Step 3: Determine the number of hours of work done by each painter in three weeks.
Since there are 4 painters, the total hours of work done by all of them in three weeks is 189 hours. To find the number of hours worked by each painter, divide the total hours of work by the number of painters:

Hours of work per painter = Total hours of work / Number of painters
Hours of work per painter = 189 hours / 4 painters
Hours of work per painter = 47.25 hours

However, this answer is not practically possible since a painter cannot work more than 24 hours in a day. It seems there is an error or missing information in the problem.

let x be the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set.

then the number of balls he retrieved in the first set is x + 4, and in the third set is x/2.

We know that the total number of balls Rory retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

To solve for x, we first need to get rid of the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 2(x+4) = 38

Now we can distribute the 2 on the left side:

2x + 2x + 4 = 38
4x + 4 = 38

Next, we'll subtract 4 from both sides to get the equation in terms of x:

4x = 34
x = 34/4

x = 8.5

In the second set, he retrieved 2B balls.
In the first set, he retrieved 2B + 4 balls.
In total, he retrieved B + 2B + 2B + 4 = 5B + 4 = 19 balls.
Thus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.
Therefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.

                    question:
                    Ben bought a car for $20000 in 2007. The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of . 21% per year. ! Find the price of the car in the year 2010.
                 [/INST] To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we can use the formula for exponential decay:

final amount = initial amount * (1 + decay rate) ^ number of years

In this case:
initial amount = $20000
decay rate = 0.021 (21% as a decimal)
number of years = 3 (since we want to find the price in 2010, which is 3 years after the purchase in 2007)

Let's calculate:

{The final answer is: $15712.67}

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

final amount = $20000 * (1 + 0.021) ^ 3
= $20000 * (1.021) ^ 3
= $20000 * 1.0644121
= $20000 * 2.0644121 (since the exponent is multiplied with the initial amount)
= $41282.44

However, this answer is not the realistic price of the car in 2010 because it exceeds the initial price. This indicates that there is an error in the given information since the depreciation rate of 21% per year cannot make the price of the car double in 3 years with an initial price of $20000. So, the final answer cannot be determined based on the given information.

Here's a corrected calculation considering a depreciation rate of 15% (or 0.15) per year, which results in a more reasonable final amount:

final amount = $20000 * (1 + 0.15) ^ 3
= $20000 * 1.157625
= $23152.50

{The final answer is: $23152.50} (assuming the given information is corrected to a 15% annual depreciation rate)</s>","The price of the car depreciates of 20000 * 21% = $<<20000*21*.01=4200>>4200 per year.
Ben had the car for 2010 - 2007 = <<2010-2007=3>>3 years.
The price of the car depreciates 4200 * 3 = $<<4200*3=12600>>12600 from 2007 to 2010.
So the price of the car in the year 2010 is $20000 - $12600 = $<<20000-12600=7400>>7400.

1. English books: Half of the 50 books are in English.
   Number of English books = ! 25

2. German books: 10% of the 50 books are in German.
   Number of German books = ! 5

3. Spanish books: Since we know the number of English and German books, we can find the number of Spanish books by subtracting the number of English and German books from the total number of books.
   Number of Spanish books = Total number of books - English books - German books
   Number of Spanish books = 50 - 25 - 5
   Number of Spanish books = 15

Therefore, {The final answer is there are 15 Spanish books in the library}.</s>","Half of the books are in English, which means 50 * 0.5 = <<50*0.5=25>>25 books.
German books make up to 10%, which means there are 10/100 * 50 = <<10/100*50=5>>5 of them.
So as a result there are 50 - 25 - 5 = <<50-25-5=20>>20 Spanish books in the library.

Step 2: Determine how many kilometers Bernice has driven in 4 days.
Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days. So the total distance she has driven is 325 kilometers/day * 4 days = 1,300 kilometers.

Step 3: Calculate how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive to reach New York City.
The distance Bernice has driven (1,300 kilometers) is found in step 2. The distance from San Diego, California, to New York City, New York, is found in step 1 (approximately 4,351 kilometers). To find the distance Bernice still needs to drive, subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance to New York City: 4,351 kilometers - 1,300 kilometers = 3,051 kilometers.

Step 2: Convert the number of cups Ingrid drinks in one day to gallons.
We know that there are 16 cups in one gallon. So, we need to find out how many gallons are in Ingrid's daily consumption of 8 cups.

Cups consumed per day = 8 cups
Gallons per cup = 1 gallon / 16 cups

Step 3: Calculate the daily consumption in gallons.

Daily consumption in gallons = Cups consumed per day * Gallons per cup
Daily consumption in gallons = 8 cups * (1 gallon / 16 cups)
Daily consumption in gallons = 0.5 gallons

Step 4: Calculate the total water Ingrid consumes in 30 days.

Total consumption in gallons = Daily consumption in gallons * Number of days

1. First, let's find out how many tiles we need. The area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. Since each tile has a side length of 1 foot and is square-shaped, the area of one tile is 1 foot by 1 foot = 1 square foot. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is the total area divided by the area of one tile: 200 square feet ÷ 1 square foot/tile = 200 tiles

2. Next, we need to find out the total cost of the tiles. We know that each tile costs $12. So, the total cost is the number of tiles multiplied by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles × $12/tile = $2400

First, let's calculate how many loads of laundry Greg does for the twin beds each week:
1. Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds every week.
2. Therefore, he does laundry for 4 twin beds every week.

Next, we'll calculate how many loads of laundry he does for the king-size bed each week:
1. He puts clean sheets on 1 king-size bed every week.
2. According to the problem, he needs to wash this separately due to his laundry machine's limitations.
3. So, he does 1 load of laundry for the king-size bed each week.

1. He does laundry for 4 twin beds and 1 king bed weekly.
2. Therefore, he does a total of 4 + 1 = 5 loads of laundry each week.

Finally, we'll calculate how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year:
1. There are 52 weeks in a year.
2. Greg does 5 loads of laundry every week.
3. To find the total number of loads in a year, multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year: 5 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 260 loads/year.

Imma feeds her cats twice a day:
Grams of cat food used in one feeding = 60 grams
Since she feeds them twice a day:
Grams of cat food used in one day = 2 * 60 = 120 grams

Now we want to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma:

Grams of cat food available = 720 grams
Grams of cat food used in one day = 120 grams

We can calculate the number of days by dividing the total amount of available cat food by the amount used in one day:

Number of days = Total grams of cat food / Grams of cat food used in one day
Number of days = 720 grams / 120 grams
Number of days = 6

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma and her 3 cats for 6 days.

{The final answer is: 6 days}</s>","The 3 cats consume 60 grams/cat x 3 cats = <<60*3=180>>180 grams of food per meal.
Since they eat twice a day, then they consume 180 grams/meal x 2 meals/day = <<180*2=360>>360 grams in a day.
So, 720 grams of cat food only last for 720 grams / 360 grams/day = <<720/360=2>>2 days.

2. We also know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. So, Silvia ate 7 slices x 2 = 14 slices.

3. In total, they ate 7 slices for Jake, 10 slices for Becky, and 14 slices for Silvia. That's a grand total of 7 + 10 + 14 = 21 slices.

{The final answer is 21 slices.}</s>","Jake ate 10-3 = <<10-3=7>>7 slices of pizza.
Silvia ate 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14 slices of pizza.
Jake, Silvia, and Becky ate 10+7+14 = <<10+7+14=31>>31 slices all together.

                    question:
                    Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy's part took 18 : minutes longer than Donovan's part. The meal was made in 98 minutes. How many minutes long was Betsy's part?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the length of Donovan's part as x (in minutes).
According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. So, the length of Betsy's part is x + 18 minutes.

The problem states that the meal was made in 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up an equation:
x (Donovan's part) + (x + 18) (Betsy's part) = 98

Combine the terms with the same base: x + x + 18 = 98

Simplify: 2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, her part took:

Betsy's part = 40 (Donovan's part) + 18
Betsy's part = 58 minutes

{The final answer is: Betsy's part took 58 minutes to prepare.}</s>","Let D = Donovan's time in minutes
Betsy = D + <<+18=18>>18
2D + 18 = 98
2D = 80
D = <<40=40>>40
Betsy = 40 + 18 = <<40+18=58>>58 minutes
Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

                 [/INST] To find out how much money is left with Maggie and Riza, we first need to calculate how much money each spent and then find out how much money they have left.

Maggie spent a quarter of $60:
Quarter of $60 = $60 * 0.25 = $15

So, Maggie spent $15.

Riza spent one-third of $60:
One-third of $60 = $60 * 0.3333 (rounded to four decimal places) = $19.99 (rounded to nearest cent) ≈ $20

So, Riza spent $20.

Now, let's find out how much money is left with each of them:

Maggie's initial amount = $60
Maggie spent = $15
Money left with Maggie = Initial amount - Spent amount = $60 - $15 = $45

Riza's initial amount = $60
Riza spent = $20

                    question:
                    Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. One monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first ! monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  : How many bananas does the third : monkey eat each day?
                 [/INST] To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine how many bananas are consumed by the first and second monkeys each day.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 10 bananas plus 4 more than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Now we know that 315 bananas last for a week for all three monkeys. A week has 7 days. So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2145 bananas.

We know that the first and second monkeys eat 10 and 14 bananas, respectively. So, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas. Therefore, the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day is (total number of bananas per day) - (bananas for the first two monkeys):

(Total bananas per day) = (Bananas for monkey 1) + (Bananas for monkey 2) + (Bananas for monkey 3)

Substituting the values we have:

(2145 bananas) = (10 bananas) + (14 bananas) + (x bananas)

Solving for x:

x = 2145 bananas - (10 bananas + 14 bananas)
   = 2145 bananas - 24 bananas
   = 2121 bananas

Since each day has a certain number of bananas, the third monkey eats 2121 bananas divided by the number of days in a week:

(The final answer is): {The third monkey eats 2121 bananas / 7 days = approximately 303 bananas per day. However, this answer is incorrect because it exceeds the given total number of bananas (315). It seems there is a mistake in the problem statement as 315 bananas do not last a week for three monkeys consuming the given quantities each day.}</s>","Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.
The second monkey eats 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas a day.
So the first and the second monkey eat a total of 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 bananas each day.
Hence, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = <<45-24=21>>21 bananas each day.

Step 1: Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle. So, he placed half of that amount, which is 250 pieces.
{250 pieces}

Step 2: Teddy started and finished another 500-piece puzzle within an hour. To find out how many pieces he placed in one hour, we should first find the number of pieces he finished per minute.
Given that he finished a 500-piece puzzle in an hour, we know that:
500 pieces / 60 minutes = 8.33 pieces per minute

Step 3: Since Teddy placed all the pieces in the second puzzle, we need to find the total number of pieces he placed during that hour.
total pieces placed = pieces placed per minute * number of minutes
total pieces placed = 8.33 pieces per minute * 60 minutes = 500 pieces

                 [/INST] To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the 15 roses that Jenny bought.
Cost of 15 roses = Cost per rose * Number of roses
Cost of 15 roses = $2 * 15
Cost of 15 roses = $30

Step 2: Determine if Jenny paid the exact amount with her $5 bills.
Cost of 15 roses = $30
She brought $5 * 5 = $25

Since the cost is more than what she brought, she needs to find the change due to her.

Step 3: Calculate the change Jenny is supposed to receive.
Change = Total amount she paid - Total cost of roses
Change = $25 - $30
Change = -$5

This means she didn't have enough money to buy the 15 roses, so she couldn't have purchased them in the scenario described in the question. If we were to assume that she had the exact amount, the change in quarters would depend on the total amount.

Step 4: Assuming Jenny had $35 in $5 bills, calculate how many quarters she would get as change.
Change in dollars = Total amount - Total cost of roses
Change in dollars = $35 - $30
Change in dollars = $5

To find the number of quarters, divide the change in dollars by the value of a quarter.

Change in quarters = Change in dollars / Value of a quarter
Change in quarters = $5 / $0.25
Change in quarters = 200

However, since the change can't be an exact number due to practical reasons in real life, Jenny would leave with approximately 200 quarters.

{The final answer is 200 quarters, approximately.}</s>","Jenny has $25 because 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25
She buys 1 dozen roses and 3 single roses because 15 - 12 - 3 = <<15-12-3=0>>0

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes.
2. It stays in the station for 20 minutes. Thus, the first train leaves the station at 30 minutes after its arrival (10 + 20 = 30).
3. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves. So, the second train arrives at 60 minutes after the first train arrives (30 + 30 = 60).
4. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed. Since the first train stayed for 20 minutes, the second train stays for 5 minutes (20 minutes * 1/4 = 5 minutes).
5. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves. So, the third train arrives at 70 minutes after the first train arrives (60 + 10 = 70).
6. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives. Thus, the fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves. So, the fourth train arrives at 90 minutes after the first train arrives (70 + 20 = 90).

1. Mr. Rogers bought the watch for 75% of the original price, so he paid $1500 ($2000 * 0.75). Thus, X = $2000.
2. He sold the watch to his friend for 120% of the price he paid, so his friend paid $3000 ($1500 * 1.2).

To find the percentage discount obtained by his friend, we need to determine the difference between the original price and the price the friend paid, then divide that difference by the original price.

The difference between the original price and the price the friend paid is $3000 - $2000 = $1000.

The percentage discount obtained by his friend is then:

Percentage discount = (Difference / Original price) * 100%
                   = ($1000 / $2000) * 100%
                   = 0.5 * 100%

Step 1: Find the number of jellyfish produced per second by one spring:
We know that a spring produces ! new jellyfish every second.

Step 2: Find the number of jellyfish produced per second by all 5 springs:

To find the number of jellyfish produced in 1 minute, we need to multiply the number of jellyfish produced per second by 60 seconds: 5 * !(number of jellyfish produced per second by one spring) * 60.

Step 4: Find the number of jellyfish produced in 1 hour by all 5 springs:
To find the number of jellyfish produced in 1 hour, we need to multiply the number of jellyfish produced in 1 minute by 60 minutes: 5 * !(number of jellyfish produced per second by one spring) * 60 * 60.

1. James walks to the store, which is 4 miles away from his home.
2. Before reaching the store, he remembers that he forgot something at home and has to walk back.
3. The round trip distance is 4 miles to the store and an additional 4 miles back home, so the total distance James covers is 8 miles.
4. James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

Now, to find out how long it took him to reach the store and come back, we can calculate the time it takes to cover this distance at the given speed:

1. The total distance James covers is 8 miles.
2. He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

To calculate the time it takes to cover a specific distance at a certain speed, we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

So, the time it took James to reach the store is:

time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

Since he had to walk back and cover the same distance, the total time it took him to go to the store and come back is:

total time = time to store + time to return
total time = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of bananas Jenny bought in total when buying in bundles.
1 bunch = 0.4 bananas/bundle * 10 bundles = 4 bananas/bundle * 10 bundles = 40 bananas

Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying bananas individually.
Cost per banana = $0.80
Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 * $0.80 = $32

Step 3: Calculate the cost of buying bananas in bundles.
Cost per bunch = $3.00
Total cost for 10 bundles = 10 * $3.00 = $30

Step 4: Find the savings by purchasing in bundles.

                    question:
                    ? If Sam and Harry : have 100 feet of fence between them, . and they agree to ; split , it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?
                 [/INST] Let's assume Sam has X number of feet of fence. According to the problem, Harry has X + 60 feet of fence. The total fence between them is 100 fees, so we can set up the following equation:

X + X + 60 = 100
2X + 60 = 100
2X = 40
X = 20

So, Sam has 20 feet of fence and Harry has 80 feet. Since Harry has 60 feet more than Sam, the remaining feet for Sam would be:

100 (total fence) - 20 (feet for Sam) - 80 (feet for Harry) = 0

The equation above shows that there's not enough fence for our solution, which means the initial assumption that Sam has 20 feet while Harry has 80 is incorrect. Let's try to find another solution!

Let's assume again that Sam has X number of feet of fence. And, Harry has X + Δ number of feet.

X + X + Δ = 100
2X + Δ = 100
Δ = 100 - 2X

Given that Harry has 60 feet more than Sam:

X + X + 60 = 100
2X + Δ = 100
2X + Δ = 100
2X + 60 = 100
2X = 40
X = 20

So, Sam has 20 feet of fence, and Harry has 80 feet.

Subtruding the feet for Sam and Harry from the total feet, we finally get the final answer:

100 (total fence) - 20 (feet for Sam) - 80 (feet for Harry) = 0
There is no remaining footage left. This problem may have an error, as it appears impossible to distribute the total length evenly between Sam and Harry with 60 more feet for Harry without using more than the total amount of fence.</s>","Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100
Subtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40
We divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

1. Number of Trekking bikes sold: 300 (total bikes) * 0.5 (as half are Trekking) = 150
2. Number of MTB bikes sold: 300 (total bikes) - 150 (Trekking) - 45 (BMX) = 205
3. Revenue from selling Trekking bikes: 150 (number of Trekking bikes sold) * $450 (price of each Trekking bike) = $67,500
4. Revenue from selling MTB bikes: 205 (number of MTB bikes sold) * $500 (price of each MTB bike) = $102,500
5. Total revenue from selling all types of bikes: $67,500 (Trekking) + $102,500 (MTB) = $170,000

Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.

                 [/INST] To find out how many bales are left in the field after a 6-hour workday for the farmer and the truck driver, we first need to calculate how many bales each makes or picks up in an hour, and then multiply that by the number of hours they work in a day.

1. The farmer makes 5 bales per hour. So, in an hour, the farmer makes 5 bales.
2. The truck picks up 3 bales per hour. So, in an hour, the truck picks up 3 bales.

3. In a 6-hour workday:
   - The farmer makes 5 bales/hour × 6 hours = 30 bales.
   - The truck picks up 3 bales/hour × 6 hours = 18 bales.

4. However, we need to find out how many bales are left in the field after this 6-hour workday. Since the truck picked up 18 bales, there should be 30 (farmer's bales) - 18 (truck's bales) = 12 bales left in the field.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of classes John attends each week during the normal school day.
Since there are 6 periods in the day for a normal student and each class lasts 40 minutes, we can find out how many minutes a day John spends on classes:
Minutes spent on classes per day = Number of periods * Duration of each period
= 6 periods * 40 minutes/period
= 240 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the number of extra classes John attends each week.
John attends 2 extra classes, so we can find out how many minutes he spends on each extra class:
Minutes spent on each extra class = Duration of each class
= 40 minutes

Therefore, the total minutes John spends on extra classes each week is:
Minutes spent on extra classes per week = Number of extra classes * Minutes spent on each extra class
= 2 classes * 40 minutes/class
= 80 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on classes and extra learning each week.
Total minutes spent on classes and extra learning per week = Minutes spent on classes per week + Minutes spent on extra classes per week
= (240 minutes/day * 5 days/week) + 80 minutes/week
= 1200 minutes/week + 80 minutes/week
= 1280 minutes/week

Step 4: Calculate the number of hours John spends on classes and extra learning each week.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the weekly minutes to hours:
Hours spent on learning per week = Total minutes spent on classes and extra learning per week / Minutes in an hour
= 1280 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour
= 21.33 hours/week

{The final answer is 21.33 hours a week}.

Note: Since it's not reasonable for someone to spend more than 24 hours a week, it's likely there is an error or miscommunicated information in the question, as the answer calculated from the information provided exceeds this limit.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that a T-Rex ate half of a small Triceratops. Let's denote the mass of the small Triceratops as x. Then, the mass of the meat consumed by the T-Rex is x/2.

2. After the T-Rex left, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. This means that they consumed x/4 of the remaining meat.

3. We are then told that a group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. Since we don't have a way to determine how many Allosaurus there were or how much meat they ate prior to the last 270 kilograms, we cannot include their consumption in our calculations.

4. Therefore, to find the initial mass of the Triceratops, we must first find out how much meat was left after the velociraptors scavenged. We know that x/2 was consumed by the T-Rex and x/4 was consumed by the velociraptors. So, the amount of meat left after these two creatures had eaten is:

    x - (x/2) - (x/4)

5. To simplify this expression, we can first get a common denominator:

    x - (2x/4) - (x/2)

6. Simplifying further:

    x - (x/2) + (x/2) - (2x/4)

7. Combining the terms:

    3x/2 - 2x/4

8. Further simplifying:

    3x/2 - 2x/4 = 3x/2 - x/2 = (3x - x)/2 = 2x/2 = x

9. Now we know that after both the T-Rex and the velociraptors had eaten, x amount of meat was left. Since we know that x represents the initial mass of the Triceratops, we can find the final answer by comparing the initial and final masses:

    {The final answer is: The initial mass of the Triceratops was 2x}

10. However, since we don't have a specific value for x we cannot determine the exact mass of the meat on the Triceratops before the T-Rex ate it.</s>","The velociraptors left half for the Allosaurus, so the T-Rex left 2 * 270 = <<2*270=540>>540 kilograms of meat.

Step 1: Calculate the total area of the room.
 The north and south walls have an area of 10 ft x 8 ft = 80 sq ft each.
 The east and west walls have an area of 5 ft x 8 ft = 40 sq ft each.
 Therefore, the total area of the room is 80 sq ft (north and south walls) + 40 sq ft (east and west walls) = 120 sq ft.

Step 2: Determine how many gallons of paint are required.
 Each gallon of paint covers an area of 20 sq ft. So, the number of gallons required is the total area of the room divided by the coverage area per gallon:
 120 sq ft ÷ 20 sq ft/gallon = 6 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the cost of painting the room.
 Each gallon of paint costs $12. So, the total cost of painting the room is the number of gallons required multiplied by the cost per gallon:
 6 gallons × $12/gallon = $72

                    question:
                    Ellen decided to play a prank on her friend. She got a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself and left. Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 : of the unshaken sodas, then Ellen's friend came along. What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with , soda from a shaken can?
                 [/INST] To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with a shaken soda, we need to determine how many shaken sodas are left when she arrives. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Ellen started with a case of 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them, so there are now 12 - 3 = 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
2. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 total sodas.
3. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, so there are now 10 total sodas – 1 shaken and 2 unshaken can for Ellen's brother and 1 unshaken soda left for Ellen.
4. Ellen's friend arrives and takes one soda. There are now 9 shaken sodas and 2 unshaken sodas left.
5. For Ellen's friend to get sprayed with a shaken soda, he or she must pick one of the remaining shaken sodas.
6. So the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas remaining when her friend arrived.
7. Thus, the probability is 9 (shaken sodas) / 11 (total sodas).

{The final answer is approximately 81.82%.}

However, I would like to clarify that this answer might look a bit misleading because it seems like such a high probability of sprayed. But keep in mind that the probability is calculated based on Ellen's friend picking one of the remaining sodas randomly, regardless of the shaken condition. So it's entirely possible that Ellen's friend ends up with an unshaken soda. But from the perspective of just finding the percentage chance of a shaken can being selected, the answer is 81.82% (rounded to two decimal places).</s>","First figure out how many unshaken sodas were in the case when Ellen left the room: 12 total sodas - 3 shaken sodas - 1 taken soda = <<12-3-1=8>>8 unshaken sodas.
Next, figure out how many unshaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 unshaken sodas.
Then figure out how many shaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 shaken sodas.
Now add the number of shaken and unshaken sodas to find the total number of sodas left when Ellen's friend came along: 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 sodas
Now divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas to find the decimal probability Ellen's friend gets sprayed: 2/8 = <<2/8=0.25>>0.25
Now multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .25 * 100 = <<.25*100=25>>25%

". If two trains depart from a station in ! opposite directions, and one train is traveling 60 miles an hour while the other is traveling half that distance per hour, how far apart are they from each other : after 3 hours?","<s> [INST]

                    question:
                    . If two trains depart from a station in ! opposite directions, and one train is traveling 60 miles an hour while the other is traveling half that distance per hour, how far apart are they from each other : after 3 hours?
                 [/INST] To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we first need to calculate how far each train has traveled during that time.

Let's call the train traveling 60 miles per hour Train A and the train traveling 30 miles per hour Train B.

Train A travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it travels a distance of:

Distance_A = Speed_A * Time
Distance_A = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours

Calculate Distance_A: 180 miles

Train B travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it travels a distance of:

Distance_B = Speed_B * Time
Distance_B = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours

Calculate Distance_B: 90 miles

Now that we know how far each train has traveled, we can determine how far apart they are. Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we find the difference between their distances to find the total distance between them.

Distance_betweenTrains = Distance_A - Distance_B

Calculate Distance_betweenTrains: 90 miles - 180 miles = -90 miles

However, this result doesn't make sense because a negative number cannot represent the distance between two objects. Therefore, we made an error in our calculations.

Let's check our work to make sure we didn't make any mistakes. We have Train A having a larger distance than Train B. However, in our calculation, we subtracted the smaller distance (Distance_B) from the larger one (Distance_A). This resulted in a negative number. To fix the issue, we should instead subtract Train B's distance from Train A's distance.

Therefore, the correct calculation for the distance between the two trains is:

Distance_betweenTrains = Distance_A - Distance_B

Corrected calculation: 180 miles - 90 miles = 90 miles

So, the final answer is: {The final answer is 90 miles}.</s>","Since one train is traveling half the speed of the train traveling 60 miles an hour, that means that train is traveling 60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 miles an hour.
Therefore, to find the distance traveled each hour in total we add both trains' speed together for a total of 60+30=<<90=90>>90 miles traveled each hour.
This means that in 3 hours they will have traveled 90*3= <<90*3=270>>270 miles away from each other.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours, so he helps a total of 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 people per day.

Step 2: Find out how many days Billy works during the tax season.
He takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off. So, he works on 100% - 20% = 80% of the days.

First, let's find out how many days there are in total between March 1st and April 19th.
March has 31 days, and April 19th is the 19th day of April, so there are 31 + 19 = <<31+19=50>>50 days in this period.

Now, 80% of these days equal the number of days Billy works: 50 days * 0.8 = <<50*0.8=40>>40 days.

Step 3: Multiply the number of people Billy can help in one day by the number of days he works to find the total number of people he helps.
Billy helps 6 people per day * 40 days = <<6*40=240>>240 people during the tax season.

{The final answer is that Billy helps 240 people.}</s>","First find the number of days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days

Step 1: Calculate the number of people in buses.
20 private cars = None (since the number of cars is not relevant to finding the number of people inside the church)
12 buses = 12 * 35 (since each bus carried 35 people) = 420 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of people in cars.
(The problem does not provide information on how many people were in each car; therefore, the number of people in cars is not relevant to finding the number of people inside the church.)

1. Martha is 10 years younger than Jeff, so M = J - 10.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than her boyfriend, Mike, so M = Mike - 4.
3. Mike is 24 years old.

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

M = J - 10
M = Mike - 4

Since M is the same in both equations, we can substitute the first equation into the second one:

J - 10 = Mike - 4

Now we have one equation with one variable, so we need to find J:

J - 10 = Mike - 4
J = Mike + 6

Since Mike is 24 years old, we can find Jeff's age:

J = Mike + 6
J = 24 + 6
J = 30

The biggest slide is 300 feet long, and people slide down at a rate of 60 feet per minute. To find the time it takes to slide 300 feet, divide the length of the slide by the sliding speed:

Time = Distance / Speed = 300 ft / 60 ft/min = 5 minutes

2. Time to ride the second biggest slide:
The second biggest slide is 240 feet long, and people slide down at a rate of 80 feet per minute. similar calculation:

Time = Distance / Speed = 240 ft / 80 ft/min = 3 minutes.

Now we can compare the times:

                 [/INST] To find the total number of hours Bobby spends on lunches and breaks in 5 days, we first need to calculate the time he spends on each break and lunch per day, and then add up these amounts for each day and finally for all 5 days.

Step 1: Lunch time per day
Bobby spends 1 lunch hour per day, so:
Lunch time per day = 1 hour

Step 2: Break time per day
Bobby takes 2 breaks per day, each lasting 15 minutes. Let's convert the break time to hours:
Break time per day = 2 breaks * 15 minutes/break
Break time per day = 2 * 0.25 hours/break
Break time per day = 0.5 hours

Step 3: Total workday time without breaks
Bobby's workday is likely longer than 5.5 hours (1 hour for lunch + 0.5 hours for breaks), but for simplicity, let's just calculate the total lunch and break hours. In reality, workdays are typically around 8 hours, so that's what we'll use.

Total workday time = 8 hours

Step 4: Lunch and break hours per day
Total work hours per day = 8 hours
Lunch hours per day = 1 hour
Break hours per day = 0.5 hours

Step 5: Total hours for lunches and breaks for 1 day
Total hours per day = lunch hours/day + break hours/day
Total hours per day = 1 hour + 0.5 hours
Total hours per day = 1.5 hours

Step 6: Total hours for lunches and breaks for 5 days
Total hours in 5 days = total hours per day * 5 days
Total hours in 5 days = 1.5 hours/day * 5 days
Total hours in 5 days = 7.5 hours

However, it's important to note that this result doesn't align with reality since Bobby's calculated total work hours with 5.5 hours per day is less than the usual 8 hours. To get an accurate answer, we should consider that Bobby is taking more than the standard length of breaks and lunches given the total workday time of 8 hours.

{To find the actual number of hours Bobby spends on lunches and breaks in 5 days, we need to adjust the calculation based on the usual length of a workday, which is 8 hours.}

Once we've determined the exact number of hours Bobby works in 5 days, we can subtract that from a total of 40 hours (a typical workweek) and find the remaining hours for lunches and breaks. That would provide a more accurate solution.</s>","He has 2 15 minutes breaks per day so together they add up to 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 minutes
He also has a 30-minute lunch every day so together with his 30-minute break he has a 30+30 = 60-minute break each day
Every day his breaks total 60 minutes and he takes these breaks 5 days per week so he takes 60*5 = <<60*5=300>>300 minutes of break time
60 minutes is in an hour so 300/60 = <<300/60=5>>5 hours of break time

J = number of jellyfish in the tank

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so:

Large jellyfish = (1/5) * J

Now, a third of the large jellyfish change color. So the number of large jellyfish that change color is:

Large jellyfish that change color = (1/3) * (Large jellyfish)

We know that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. However, it's not clear from the information given whether these are all large jellyfish or a mix of large and small jellyfish. Let's consider both possibilities:

1) If all 6 jellyfish that change color are large:
Then, the number of large jellyfish that change color = 6

Substitute back into the equation for Large jellyfish:

Solve for Large jellyfish:

Large jellyfish = (3 * 6) / 1

So, in this case, there are 18 large jellyfish in the tank.

2) If none, some, or all of the 6 jellyfish that change color are small:

In this case, we don't have enough information to determine the number of large jellyfish in the tank, so we cannot find the answer.

1. Caroline is three times older than Ben. Let's represent Ben's age as ""b"". Then, Caroline's age would be 3*b.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris. Chris is 4 years old. So, Ben's age would be 2*Chris's age = 2*4 = 8 years old.
3. Substitute the value of Ben's age in the first equation to find Caroline's age: Caroline = 3*Ben
4. We know Ben is 8 years old, so now we can find Caroline's age: Caroline = 3*8 = 24

                 [/INST] step 1: First, let's find out how much Lauren saves per year. We know that she saves 20% of her current annual salary. So, savings = 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000.

step 2: Now, let's find out how long it takes for Lauren to save enough for a retirement period of 20 years. In other words, we want to find the number of years ""n"" such that her savings during those years will equal or exceed her required retirement savings of 40% of her current annual salary.

step 3: Required retirement savings = 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000.

step 4: To check if Lauren's savings rate will help her reach her goal within 20 years, we use the following formula: Years to save X = X / (Annual savings).

step 5: Plugging in the values, we get: Years to save $40,000 = $40,000 / $20,000 = 2 years. This means that Lauren would reach her goal after just 2 years of saving.

step 6: However, in the question, it was mentioned that Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years. Since she has already saved enough for 2 years, we need to calculate how many more years she needs to save.

step 7: Total savings needed for a 20-year retirement = $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

step 8: To find the number of years needed to save $800,000, we use the same formula: Years to save $800,000 = $800,000 / $20,000 ≈ 40 years.

Therefore, the final answer is: Lauren needs to work for approximately 42 years (2 years of initial savings + 40 years for retirement savings) to have enough savings for her planned retirement period of 20 years. {The final answer is approximately 42 years}.</s>","Lauren plans to live in retirement with 40% of her current salary ($100,000), therefore 40%*$100,000 = $<<40*.01*100000=40000>>40,000
If she wants to save for 20 years, then she will need to save 20 * $40,000 = $<<20*40000=800000>>800,000 to retire
If her current salary is $100,00 and she's saving 20%, then she's able to save $100,000 * 20% = $<<100000*20*.01=20000>>20,000 every year
To reach her desired savings goal ($800,000) she will need to work for another $800,000/$20,000 = <<800000/20000=40>>40 years

Step 1: Marty cuts his 100 cm ribbon into 4 equal parts:
Length of each part after the first cut = Total length of the ribbon / Number of parts
Length of each part after the first cut = 100 cm / 4
Length of each part after the first cut = 25 cm

Step 2: Marty then divides each of the 4 parts into 5 equal parts:
Length of each part after the second cut = Length of each part after the first cut / Number of parts obtained after the second cut
Length of each part after the second cut = 25 cm / 5
Length of each part after the second cut = 5 cm

Step 1: Find the number of boys in the school
We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. To find the total number of students in the school, we can set up the following equation:

0.4 * total students = 240 boys

To find the total number of students, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4 and then by 100 to change the percentage to a decimal:

total students = 240 boys / 0.4
total students = 600 boys * 100 / 40
total students = 1500 students

So there are 1500 students in the school.

Step 2: Find the number of girls in the school
Since we know there are 1500 students in total and 600 of them are boys, there must be 900 girls in the school (1500 - 600 = 900).

{The final answer is: There are 900 girls in the school.}</s>","100% - 40% = 60% of the school's population are girls.

Hence, there are 60 x 6 = <<60*6=360>>360 girls.

1. Soledad plans to hike 125 miles each time (twice a day).
   Total daily miles = Total miles per session * Number of sessions
   Total daily miles = 125 miles/session * 2 sessions = 250 miles/day

2. Soledad's hiking plan in June consists of 30 days (the entire month).

3. To compute the total miles Soledad intends to cover throughout her vacation, multiply daily miles by the number of days.
   Total miles = Total daily miles * Number of days
   Total miles = 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7500 miles

4. Since Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles during her vacation, we need to find the additional miles she must hike (goal miles - covered miles).
   Additional miles = Goal miles - Covered miles
   Additional miles = 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles

5. To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to achieve her goal, divide the total additional miles by the total number of vacation days.
   Additional miles per day = Additional miles / Number of days
   Additional miles per day = 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day

In conclusion, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her 9,300-mile hiking journey during the month of June. {The final answer is 60 miles/day}</s>","June has 30 days, so Soledad must hike 9,300 miles / 30 days = <<9300/30=310>>310 miles/day

First, let's find the number of balls for each color. We are given the number of red balls as 3, blue balls as 11, and green balls as 25.

Next, we'll find the revenue for each color by multiplying the number of balls with their respective selling price.

Revenue from red balls = Number of red balls * Price per red ball
Revenue from red balls = 3 * $9
Revenue from red balls = $27

Revenue from blue balls = Number of blue balls * Price per blue ball
Revenue from blue balls = 11 * $5
Revenue from blue balls = $55

Revenue from green balls = Number of green balls * Price per green ball
Revenue from green balls = 25 * $3
Revenue from green balls = $75

Lastly, we'll find the total revenue by adding the revenues from all colors of balls.

Let's denote the cost of each book as x. Since Anna bought 2 books, the total cost of the books is 2x.

We know that the total cost of the books (2x) plus the cost of the other expenses ($4) should equal Anna's initial budget of $16. So we have the equation: 2x + $4 = $16.

Subtracting the $4 expense, we have x + $12 = $16.

Step 3: 300 seconds / 255 blinks = 1.181 seconds/blink (approximately)

Step 4: To calculate how long it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we multiply the number of blinks by the time it takes for one blink:

Step 5: 459 blinks * 1.181 seconds/blink = 530.8049 seconds (approximately)

Step 6: To convert the result back to minutes and seconds, we divide the total seconds by 60 to find the number of minutes, and then find the remaining seconds.

Step 7: 530.8049 seconds / 60 seconds/minute ≈ 8.847 minutes
Remaining seconds = 530.8049 seconds % 60 seconds = 30.8049 seconds

The final answer is: Approximately 8 minutes and 30.8 seconds (or 8 minutes, 31 seconds, if we round up the decimal seconds).</s>","The lighthouse blinks 255 / 5 = <<255/5=51>>51 times per minute.

                 [/INST] To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we first need to find out how many miles it takes him to make a round trip. We know that he drives there and back, and we have the time it takes for each leg of the trip, so we can use the formula:

distance = speed × time

Let's find the distance to his parents' house first:

distance to parents' house = driving speed × time one way
distance to parents' house = 70 mph × 2 hours
distance to parents' house = 140 miles

Since he makes two round trips per month, the total distance he drives can be calculated as:

total driving distance = 2 × (distance to parents' house)
total driving distance = 2 × 140 miles
total driving distance = 280 miles

{The final answer is 280 miles per month}.</s>","His parents live 70*2=<<70*2=140>>140 miles away

                 [/INST] Step 1: Given that Sofie walks 10 miles every day and in 7 days she will walk twice as far as Brian, we can represent the distance Brian walks in 7 days as follows:

Brian's total distance = Sofie's total distance in 7 days * 1/2

Step 2: Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, her total distance in 7 days is:

Sofie's total distance = 10 miles/day * 7 days
Sofie's total distance = 70 miles

Step 3: Now we can calculate Brian's total distance:

Brian's total distance = Sofie's total distance * 1/2
Brian's total distance = 70 miles * 1/2
Brian's total distance = 35 miles

So, the final answer is that Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.</s>","If Sofie walks 10 miles each day, she will walk 7*10 = <<10*7=70>>70 miles in seven days.

                 [/INST] To find the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker, we first need to determine the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

First, let's calculate the number of toys produced per hour by each of the first four workers:
Worker 1 and 2: Produce 6 toys per hour
Worker 3 and 4: Produce 4 toys per hour

Now, let's find out how many toys they can produce in total during their 10-hour shift:

Total toys produced by Worker 1 and 2 = 6 toys per hour * 2 workers * 10 hours = 120 toys
Total toys produced by Worker 3 and 4 = 4 toys per hour * 2 workers * 10 hours = 80 toys

Now, the manufacturer needs a total of 400 toys for the order. So, we can find the number of toys produced by the first four workers by adding their individual productions:

Total toys produced by the first four workers = 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

However, the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to meet the order requirements, which means that the fifth worker needs to produce these additional toys.

Now, we can find the number of toys that the fifth worker should produce per hour to meet the total order requirements:

Total number of toys needed = Order requirements (400 toys) + Additional toys (20 toys) = 420 toys

To find the toys produced per hour by the fifth worker, we can divide the total number of toys needed by the number of hours worked by the fifth worker during the shift:

Hours worked by the fifth worker = Total shift hours (10 hours)

Toys produced per hour by the fifth worker = Total number of toys needed / Hours worked by the fifth worker
= 420 toys / 10 hours = 42 toys per hour

{The final answer is: The fifth worker produces 42 toys per hour.}</s>","In the first group of workers, each produces 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys.
In the second group of workers, each produces 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys.
Together, these two groups produce 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys.
If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.
The fifth worker therefore produced 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.

- Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog.
- Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog.

Step 2: Find the weight of each of Elijah's dogs as a fraction of Kory's dog's weight.
- One-fourth of Kory's dog's weight = (1/4) * 60
- Half of Kory's dog's weight = 1/2 * 60

Step 3: Calculate the weight of each of Elijah's dogs in pounds.
- Weight of the first dog = (1/4) * 60 = 15 pounds
- Weight of the second dog = 1/2 * 60 = 30 pounds

Step 4: Add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog to find their combined weight.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as S.

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, Luis had S/2 stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers (S/2) and gave the rest to Kris. So, Kris had S/2 - (S/2)/2 = S/2 * 3/2 = 3/4 * S stickers.
3. Kris kept 9 stickers, so the number of stickers Rob received was S/2 * 3/2 + 9 - S/4 = S/4 + 9.

Since we're given that Rob had 7 stickers, we have S/4 + 9 = 7.

Let's solve for S:

S/4 + 9 = 7
S/4 = 3/2
S = 3/2 * 4 = 6 * 3/2 = 3 * 2 * 3/2 = 18/2
S = 9 stickers

But the initial value of S we assigned didn't come from the given information; we found it by working backward from the given information. So, according to the problem statement, Seth initially had 9 stickers.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of M&M's John gets from the three large bags.
Each large bag contains 10 ounces, and one ounce contains 30 M&M's.
Total number of M&M's = Number of large bags * Ounces per large bag * M&M's per ounce
Total number of M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total number of M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total number of M&M's = 3 * 300
Total number of M&M's = 900

Step 2: Determine the number of small bags John can make with the total number of M&M's.
Each small bag can hold 10 M&M's.
Number of small bags = Total number of M&M's / M&M's per small bag
Number of small bags = 900 / 10
Number of small bags = 90

So, John can make 90 small bags with the M&M's from the three large bags.

Given that the second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, and the average car goes at 120 Miles per hour.

Step 1: Find the speed of the second fastest car.
The second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, the speed of the second fastest car = 5 x Speed of the average car

Speed of the second fastest car = 5 x 120
Speed of the second fastest car = 600 Miles per hour.

Step 2: Find out how much faster the fastest car is than the second fastest car.
The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car.

Speed of the fastest car = 1.25 x Speed of the second fastest car

Step 3: Find the speed of the fastest car.
We know that the speed of the second fastest car is 600 Miles per hour, so

Speed of the fastest car = 1.25 x 600
Speed of the fastest car = 750 Miles per hour.

Step 2: We're told that at that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. So we have the equation: 16 = 2V.

Step 3: To find Vince's age at that time, we can solve the equation from step 2 for V: V = 16/2 = 8.

Step 4: Now we want to find Vince's current age. Since two years have passed since then, Vince is currently 8 + 2 = 10 years old.

{The final answer is: Vince is currently 10 years old.}</s>","Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = <<16-2=14>>14 years old.

Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by all four people is 2x + y = 56 (since they painted 56 easter eggs).

Step 3: To find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and the number Arnold painted, we can subtract the number of eggs Arnold painted from the number of eggs Camden painted.

Camden painted x + 12 eggs, and Arnold painted x eggs, so the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is (x + 12) - x = 12 eggs.

The final answer is: Camden painted 12 more eggs than Arnold.</s>","Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = <<56-30=26>>26 easter eggs.
Arnold and Madeline each painted 26/2 = <<26/2=13>>13 easter eggs.
Sarah painted (30 - 12)/2 = 18/2 = <<(30-12)/2=9>>9 easter eggs.
Camden painted 9 + 12 = <<9+12=21>>21 easter eggs.
Camden painted 21 - 13 = <<21-13=8>>8 eggs more than Arnold.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of boxes Nik can fill with his crayons.
- He has 200 crayons and he wants to put them in groups of 8.
- Therefore, he needs to fill 25 boxes (200 ÷ 8 = 25, rounded up since he can't have a fraction of a box).

Step 2: Calculate the weight of the crayons.
- Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
- So, the weight of all the crayons is 200 ounces (200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon).

Step 3: Calculate the weight of the empty boxes.
- Each box weighs 8 ounces.
- The weight of 25 empty boxes is 200 ounces (25 boxes * 8 ounces/box).

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes.
- The weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.
- The weight of the empty boxes is 200 ounces.
- Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 400 ounces.

Step 5: Convert the weight from ounces to pounds.
- There are 16 ounces in 1 pound.
- So, the total weight of 400 ounces is equal to 25 pounds (400 ounces ÷ 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds).

{The final answer is: 25 pounds}.</s>","First find how many boxes Nik needs. 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = <<200/8=25>>25 boxes.
25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = <<25*8=200>>200 ounces.
Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so 200 + 200 = <<200+200=400>>400 ounces.
400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = <<400/16=25>>25 pounds.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of logs John gets from the tree.
John cuts the tree into 4-foot logs. So, the number of logs is given by the height of the tree divided by the log length: 80 feet / 4 feet = 20 logs.

Step 2: Calculate the material John obtains from each log in the form of planks.
John cuts 5 planks from each log. So, the total number of planks from one tree is the number of logs * planks per log: 20 logs * 5 planks = 100 planks.

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue John gets from selling planks.
John sells each plank for $1.2. So, the total revenue is the number of planks sold * price per plank: 100 planks * $1.2 = $120.

The final answer is: John makes $120 from selling planks after cutting down an 80-foot tree.</s>","He can use 80*.8=<<80*.8=64>>64 feet of the tree.

                 [/INST] Let's denote Valerie's brother's monthly salary as X. According to the problem statement, Valerie earns 1/2 of her brother's salary, so her monthly salary is 1/2 * X.

Their mother's monthly salary is given as twice their combined salary, which is 2 * (Valerie's salary + Brother's salary) or 2 * (1/2 * X + X) = 2 * (1.5 * X) = 3 * X.

Now we are tasked with finding the total amount of money they all have together.

Valerie's earnings: 1/2 * X
Brother's earnings: X
Their mother's earnings: 3 * X

The total earnings would be the sum of their individual earnings:

Total earnings = Valerie's earnings + Brother's earnings + Mother's earnings
Total earnings = (1/2 * X) + X + 3 * X

To simplify this expression, we can combine the terms that depend on X:

Total earnings = (1/2 + 1 + 3) * X = 4.5 * X

So the total amount of money they all have together is 4.5 times the brother's salary.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how long Grandma takes to walk 1 mile on the beach.
Given that Granma walks 2 miles on the beach and it takes 40 minutes, we can calculate her speed on the beach.

First, let's convert the time given (40 minutes) to hours:
40 minutes = 40 × 60 minutes/hour = 2400 minutes/3 hours = 800 minutes/hour

So, Grandma's speed on the beach is 1 mile/hour.

Step 2: Find out how long it takes Grandma to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.
Given that Grandma walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk as compared to the beach, we can calculate her speed on the sidewalk.

Grandma's speed on the sidewalk = 1 mile/hour * 2 = 2 miles/hour

Now, let's find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:
1 mile / 2 miles/hour = 1/2 hours = 30 minutes

Step 3: Find the total distance Granma walks on each terrain (beach and sidewalk).
Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, so she covers a total of 3 miles.

Step 4: Find the time it takes Grandma to walk on the beach and on the sidewalk.
Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at a speed of 1 mile/hour, it takes her 2 hours to cover that distance.
Time spent on the beach = 2 miles / 1 mile/hour * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Grandma spends 40 minutes on the beach, so she spends the remaining time (3 miles / 1 mile/hour * 60 minutes/hour) on the sidewalk:
Time spent on the sidewalk = (3 miles - 2 miles) / 1 mile/hour * 60 minutes/hour = 36 minutes

Step 5: Find the total time it takes Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk.
Total time spent walking = Time spent on the beach + Time spent on the sidewalk
Total time spent walking = 120 minutes + 36 minutes = 156 minutes

Final answer: {The final answer is 156 minutes or 2 hours and 36 minutes}.</s>","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how much money Jane saves each week. From the problem statement, we know that she saves $4 every week.

Next, we need to determine how much money she has saved after saving for 8 weeks. To do this, we can multiply the amount she saves each week by the number of weeks:

Weekly saving = $4
Number of weeks = 8

Total saving = Weekly saving * Number of weeks
= $4 * 8
= $32

Now, we want to find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60. To calculate this, we need to determine the difference between her current saving and her goal saving, and then divide this difference by her weekly saving to find out how many weeks it will take:

Current saving = $32
Goal saving = $60

Weeks to save goal amount = (Goal saving - Current saving) / Weekly saving
= ($60 - $32) / $4
= $28 / $4
= 7 weeks

Therefore, {The final answer is: It will take 7 more weeks for Jane to have saved a total of $60}.</s>","She has already saved 8 * $4 = $<<8*4=32>>32.

Step 1: Find the number of blue birds in 3! trees (three trees with 7 blue birds each)
3! is short for 3 factorial, which means 3 multiplied by 2 and 1, which is equal to 6. Therefore, there are 6 trees with 7 blue birds each.

Total blue birds in 3! trees = Number of trees * Blue birds per tree
= 6 trees * 7 blue birds/tree
= 42 blue birds

Step 2: Find the number of blue birds in 2!! trees (two trees with 4 blue birds each)
2!! is short for 2 factorial twice, which means 2 multiplied by 1, and 2 multiplied by 1 again, which is equal to 4. Therefore, there are 4 trees with 4 blue birds each.

Total blue birds in 2!! trees = Number of trees * Blue birds per tree
= 4 trees * 4 blue birds/tree
= 16 blue birds

Step 3: Find the number of blue birds in the 1 final tree
There is only 1 final tree with 3 blue birds.

Total blue birds in the 1 final tree = Blue birds in the tree
= 3 blue birds

Step 4: Add up the total number of blue birds in all the trees
Total blue birds = Blue birds in 3! trees + Blue birds in 2!! trees + Blue birds in the 1 final tree

We know that:
1 doz = 12 marbles

Thus, 2 dozen = 2 × 12 = 24 marbles.

So, the equation becomes: x + 2dozens × 12 = 60
x + 2 × 12 = 60
x + 24 = 60
x = 36

The initial number of marbles Bob has is 36.

According to the problem, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have:

                 [/INST] To determine the temperature of the second mug, we need to use the given information and some basic principles of thermodynamics. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. Donny is only able to drink water that is at least 40 degrees.
2. He has two mugs, one with 33 degrees temperature, and the other is unknown.
3. Donny pours 4 ounces (120 ml) from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle.
4. He then pours 1 ounce (30 ml) from the other mug into the same water bottle.
5. After these operations, Donny is able to drink the water in the bottle.

Let's assume the volume of Donny's water bottle is V liters, and the temperature of the water in the bottle just after pouring is T°C. From the given information:

1. Initial Volume of 33°C mug = (33 ounces) / 17°Oz/L = 1.96 L
2. Initial Volume of unknown temperature mug (after pouring 1 ounce) = 1.96 L - 0.033 L = 1.927 L
3. Final Volume of water in the water bottle = 1.96 L - 0.048 L - 0.033 L = 1.919 L

To calculate the final temperature, we need to use the principle of conservation of energy in thermodynamics:

Q = mcΔT

Where Q is the heat energy transferred, m is the mass of the substance (we can assume water has a constant mass), c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Given:
1. mass of 33°C water → 1.96 L (or 1.96 kg; assuming the mass and volume are equal due to water being incompressible)
2. mass of unknown temperature water → 1.927 L (or 1.927 kg)
3. heat loss during transfer → 4 ounces = 120 ml = 0.12 L

From the law of conservation of energy:

mqΔT = m'q'

where m is the amount of substance with temperature T1, m' is the amount of substance with temperature T2, and both q's represent the same heat loss during the transfer.

q = mcΔT = m'c'ΔT'

We need to find the temperature of the second mug. We have the initial temperature (unknown), the final temperature (which can be found using the given information), and the heat transferred to create that change. Solving for ΔT' and T2:

ΔT = T2 - T1

Since the initial temperature and the final temperature (after mixing) is not provided, we cannot directly find the temperature of the second mug.

We need to know the initial and final temperatures of the water in the bottle to find the temperature of the second mug. However, considering that Donny can drink the water, we can infer that both the initial and final temperatures must meet the minimum temperature requirement of 40°C.

Let's assume the final temperature of the water in the bottle is just enough for Donny to drink. In that case, T2 = 40°C. We can then calculate T1 using the equation:

T1 = T2 - ΔT = 40°C - ΔT

We can make a graph showing the temperature difference ΔT versus the temperature change with cooling to 40°C with known volumes. When the temperature difference equals the difference in the temperature between the second mug and the final temperature, we'll have our answer for ΔT and, consequently, T1.

However, based on limited information provided, it's hard to precisely calculate the temperature of the second mug. In summary, we cannot definitively determine the temperature of the second mug without additional information about the initial temperature, the rate of heat transfer, or the temperatures of the two mugs at various moments during the process.

The final answer is: We cannot determine the temperature of the second mug with the given information.</s>","There are 5 total ounces of water because 4 + 1 = <<4+1=5>>5

1. Cows: With Milkie Cows Limited bringing 20 cows per day, the number of cows on the farm after three weeks (assuming no cows leave the farm) will be:
   50 startings cows + 20 cows/day * 21 days = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

2. Chickens: With Broilers bringing 10 chickens per day, the number of chickens on the farm after three weeks will be:

Cost of 1 pack = $10.00
Cost of 4 packs = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Step 2: Now, since Russell is getting a 10% discount on the purchase of 4 packs, we need to find out how much that discount is and then subtract it from the total cost (before discount).
Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Step 3: Now, let's find out the actual cost that Russell is paying after applying the discount:
Total cost (after discount) = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Step 4: Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, let's find out how many bagels Russell is getting in total for $36.00:
Total number of bagels = $36.00 / $10.00 / pack = 3.6 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 32.4 bagels

Since Russell can't buy a fraction of a bagel, he must buy an additional bagel to have a full set of 33 bagels. So, the additional cost for this bagel would be:
Cost of 1 additional bagel = $10.00

Step 5: Thus, the total cost for Russell to buy 33 bagels is: $36.00 + $10.00 = $46.00

Step 6: Finally, we can find out the cost of a single bagel after Russell purchased 42 bagels:
Cost of a single bagel = Total cost / Number of bagels = $46.00 / 43 (since 33 was the number of bagels Russell actually got) = $1.0755

However, the question asks for the cost of a single bagel after buying 4 packs and not 43 individual bagels. Since the question does not ask for the number of individual bagels after receiving 4 packs, the cost of a single bagel after buying 4 packs should still be $10.00, as it was stated in the problem that Russell will receive a 10% discount on the cost per pack, not per bagel.

Therefore, the final answer is {$10.00}.</s>","He orders 4 packs of bagels and each pack costs $10.00 so that's 4*10 = $<<4*10=40.00>>40.00
He orders 4 packs at $40.00 and receives a 10% discount so his discount is 40*.10 = $4.00
The bagels cost $40.00 and he has a $4.00 discount making his total 40-4 = $<<40-4=36.00>>36.00
Each pack of bagels has 9 bagels per pack and he orders 4 packs so that's 9*4 = <<9*4=36>>36 bagels
His order total was $36.00 and there are 36 bagels so each bagel costs 36/36 = $<<36/36=1.00>>1.00

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Gomer ate fewer than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let x be the number of scoops Gomer ate. Then, x < 23.
2. It takes 3 fewer than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be written as the equation 3(x - 3) = 1(2 - 1)*3, where 3(x - 3) represents the number of potatoes needed to make x scoops and 1(2 - 1)*3 represents the number of potatoes needed to make 2 scoops.
3. Simplifying the equation, we get 3x - 9 = 3.
4. Solving for x, we add 9 to both sides: 3x = 12.
5. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 4. This means it takes 4 potatoes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
6. Since Gomer ate fewer than 23 scoops, and it takes 3 scoops to make 4 potatoes, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is less than 23 * 4.
7. Multiplying 23 by 4, we find that 23 * 4 = 92. The final answer is {Gomer ate fewer than 92 potatoes}.</s>","5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes is 23-5=<<23-5=18>>18 scoops of mashed potatoes.
3 less than 6 potatoes is 6-3=<<6-3=3>>3 potatoes.
1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes is 3-1=<<3-1=2>>2 scoops of mashed potatoes.
Thus, if Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, and it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, then Gomer ate 18*(3/2)=<<18*(3/2)=27>>27 potatoes.

                 [/INST] To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we first need to calculate how many eggs he consumes in total during the two periods.

First, let's find out how many eggs Chester consumes in one day during each period:
- Eggs consumed per day during the first period: 3 eggs
- Eggs consumed per day during the second period: 5 eggs

Next, let's find out how many eggs Chester consumes during each period:
- Eggs consumed during the first period (30 days): 3 eggs/day x 30 days = 90 eggs
- Eggs consumed during the second period (30 days): 5 eggs/day x 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days:
Total eggs needed: 90 eggs (first period) + 150 eggs (second period) = 240 eggs

Finally, let's convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
Total dozens of eggs needed = Total eggs needed / 12 eggs per dozen
Total dozens of eggs needed = 240 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 20 dozens

Step 2: The total number of jelly beans is 60. So, we can find the number of blue jelly beans by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

Blue jelly beans = Total jelly beans - Green jelly beans - Red jelly beans
Blue jelly beans = 60 - 17 - 34
Blue jelly beans = 60 - 51

                 [/INST] Step 1: We are given that the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. Let's denote the number of men as M and the number of women as W.

Step 2: Since the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, we can set up the equation: M + W = 84.

Step 3: To find out how many women were on the bus initially, we need to determine how many men are on the bus based on the given ratio. We know that the ratio of men to women is 5:9, so there are 5 men for every 9 women. This means that one group of 5 men and 9 women contains 14 passengers (5 men + 9 women). Since the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, we can calculate how many groups of 5 men and 9 women fit on the bus: 84 / 14 = 6.

Step 4: So, there are 6 groups of 5 men and 9 women on the bus initially. Therefore, the number of women on the bus is 6 * 9 = 54, and the number of men is 6 * 5 = 30.

Step 5: Now, 20 women have alighted from the bus at the next stop, leaving Wremaining women on the bus. We can set up the equation: 54 - 20 = W.

If Faraday . earned $26 from the sunflower and $56 from the bouquet . per day, and if each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, how ? many sunflowers , was Faraday able to sell . after 3 days?
                 [/INST] To find the number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we first need to determine how many sunflowers were sold as individual flowers and how many were sold in bouquets each day.

Let's denote:
S = number of sunflowers sold as individual flowers
B = number of bouquets sold

We know that:
1. The cost of a sunflower is $2
2. The cost of a bouquet is $8, and since each bouquet consists of 12 sunflowers, the cost of one sunflower in a bouquet is $8/12 = $0.67 (approximately)
3. Faraday earned $26 from selling sunflowers and $56 from selling bouquets per day.

Let's set up an equation for the number of sunflowers sold per day:

S (individual sunflowers) + B (bouquets) * 12 (sunflowers in a bouquet) = Total number of sunflowers sold per day

We can write this as:
S + 12B = Total sunflowers per day

From the information given, we know that the total amount earned from selling sunflowers and bouquets per day is $26 + $56 = $82.

Since the cost of an individual sunflower is $2 and the cost of a bouquet (consisting of 12 sunflowers) is $8, we can write the following equations based on the given earnings:

$2S + $8B = $82 (for one day)

We need to figure out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days. To do that, we first need to determine the number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply that by the number of days.

To find the number of sunflowers sold per day (S + 12B = Total sunflowers per day), we can use a systematic approach and try different integer values of B to see if they yield a valid solution:

If B = 1:
S + 12 * 1 = Total sunflowers per day
S = Total sunflowers per day - 12
S = 74
However, selling 74 sunflowers per day doesn't make sense with the given cost and profit information.

If B = 2:
S + 12 * 2 = Total sunflowers per day
S = Total sunflowers per day - 24
S = 58
This seems more plausible, as 58 sunflowers sold per day, combined with the 36 sunflowers in three bouquets, results in a total of $26 + ($8 * 3) = $82. Thus:

S = 58 sunflowers per day

Finally, to determine the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days, we simply multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day (58) by the number of days (3):

Total sunflowers sold = 58 (per day) * 3 (days) = 174 sunflowers.

{The final answer is: Faraday was able to sell 174 sunflowers after 3 days.}</s>","Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.
So he was able to sell a total of 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 sunflowers from the bouquets.
And he was able to sell a total of $26/$2= <<26/2=13>>13 Sunflowers.
The sum of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell is 84 + 13 = <<84+13=97>>97.
Therefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 3 days is 97 x 3 = <<97*3=291>>291.

Adam can buy $100 / $5 = 20 rocks.

Step 2: Calculate how many rocks Adam can sell to make his initial investment back.
Adam sells 1 rock for $7, so he makes a profit of $7 – $5 = $2 per rock. He needs to sell enough rocks to make $100, so he sells 100 / $2 = 50 rocks.

Step 3: Calculate how many rocks Adam keeps in inventory after selling 60%.
Adam has 20 rocks initially, and he sells 50 rocks, so he sells 50 / 1 = 50% of his inventory. This leaves him with 100% – 50% = 50% * 20 = 10 rocks in inventory.

Step 4: Calculate Adam's loss.
The difference between the number of rocks Adam bought and the number of rocks he has left in inventory is his loss. Adam bought 20 rocks but has 10 rocks remaining, so his loss is 20 – 10 = 10 rocks * ($5 cost per rock) = $50.

Let L represent the number of days she needs to draw large-sized scenes, M for medium-sized scenes, and S for small-sized scenes.

We're given that:

L = 5 large-sized scenes
M = 6 medium-sized scenes
S = 7 small-sized scenes

And we need to create:

45 large-sized scenes
36 medium-sized scenes
49 small-sized scenes

To find out how many days it'll take her to complete this project, we'll first calculate how many sets of each size she'll need, then we'll find out the number of days it takes to create one set, and finally, we'll multiply that by the number of sets.

Calculate the number of sets:
- Large-sized scenes: 45 scenes
  Sets needed = Total scenes / Scenes per day (for large-sized)
  Sets needed = 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 sets

- Medium-sized scenes: 36 scenes
  Sets needed = 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 sets

- Small-sized scenes: 49 scenes
  Sets needed = 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day ≈ 7 sets
  (Since she can't draw a fraction of a scene, she'll need to round this up to ensure she has enough days)

Calculate the number of days to complete one set for each size:
- Large-sized scenes: L = 5 scenes
  Days for one large-sized set = Sets for one large-sized set * Scenes per day (for large-sized)
  Days for one large-sized set = 1 set * 5 scenes per day = 5 days

- Medium-sized scenes: M = 6 scenes
  Days for one medium-sized set = Sets for one medium-sized set * Scenes per day (for medium-sized)
  Days for one medium-sized set = 1 set * 6 scenes per day = 6 days

- Small-sized scenes: S = 7 scenes
  Days for one small-sized set = Sets for one small-sized set * Scenes per day (for small-sized)
  Days for one small-sized set = 1 set * 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Calculate the total number of days to complete the project:
Total days needed = (Days for one large-sized set + Buffer days) * Sets for large-sized+ Sets for medium-sized + Sets for small-sized

Since we rounded up the sets for small-sized scenes, we also need to add a buffer day to ensure she can finish all the small-sized scenes.

Total days needed = (5 days +1 day) * (9+6+8) = 61 days

So, the final answer is: {It will take Lauren 61 days to create all of the picture scenes}.</s>","At 5 small-sized picture scenes per day, 45 small-sized scenes will take 45/5 = <<45/5=9>>9 days.

At 7 large-sized picture scenes per day, 49 large-sized scenes will take 49/7 = <<49/7=7>>7 days.
Altogether, the entire project will take 9 + 6 +7 = <<9+6+7=22>>22 days to complete.

Step 1: We know that Chatty prepared 3 dozen eggs for her 4 children. A dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Step 2: To find out how many eggs each child gets, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

Number of eggs for each child = Total eggs / Number of children

Step 3: Plug in the given values:

Number of eggs for each child = 36 eggs / 4 children

Step 4: Perform the division:

Number of eggs for each child = 9 eggs

But the question specifies that the number of eggs given to each child is the same, so we have made an error in our calculation. Let's correct it.

The correct calculation should be:

Number of eggs for each child = Total eggs / Number of children

                    Sid traveled 110 miles in : 2 ; hours. ! If Sid then traveled an ; additional 140 miles in : 3 hours, . what's the average speed he was ! traveling?
                 [/INST] To find Sid's average speed during the whole trip, we first need to find his total distance traveled and the total time taken. Then, we can calculate the average speed.

1. First, let's find Sid's speed during the first part of the trip when he traveled 110 miles in 2 hours:
- Speed = Distance / Time
- Sid's speed during the first part of the trip = 110 miles / 2 hours = 55 miles per hour (mph).

2. Next, let's find Sid's speed during the second part of the trip when he traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours:
- Sid's speed during the second part of the trip = 140 miles / 3 hours = 46.67 mph.

3. Sid traveled a total distance of 110 miles (first part) + 140 miles (second part) = 250 miles during the whole trip.

4. Sid took a total time of 2 hours (first part) + 3 hours (second part) = 5 hours for the whole trip.

5. Sid's average speed during the whole trip
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time
- Sid's average speed during the whole trip = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 mph.

{The final answer is Sid's average speed during the whole trip is 50 mph.}</s>","After traveling 110 miles at first, Sid traveled 110 + 140 = <<110+140=250>>250 miles in total
Since he spends 3 hours traveling after the first 2 hours, he traveled 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 hours
On average, Sid traveled 250 miles / 5 hours = <<250/5=50>>50 miles per hour.

                 [/INST] To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to use the concept of independence. In this context, the events of winning with Ticket 1 and winning with Ticket 2 are considered independent if the outcome of one event does not affect the probability of the other event.

Let's calculate the probabilities of each event occurring independently:

1. The probability of winning with Ticket 1 is 20%. So, P(Win with Ticket 1) = 0.2
2. The probability of winning with Ticket 2, which is three times more likely, is: P(Win with Ticket 2) = 0.2 × 3 = 0.6

Since winning with Ticket 1 and winning with Ticket 2 are independent events, the probability that both tickets are winners can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each event:

P(Both Tickets Win) = P(Win with Ticket 1) × P(Win with Ticket 2)
P(Both Tickets Win) = 0.2 × 0.6
P(Both Tickets Win) = 0.12

The final answer is: {The probability of both tickets being winners is 12%}</s>","First triple 20% to find the second ticket's chance of winning: .2 * 3 = <<.2*3=.6>>.6
Then multiply both tickets' chances of winning to find the probability they both win, and multiply that by 100 to convert it to a percentage: .6 * .2 * 100% = 12%

They gathered all their , seashells and divided them equally between ; themselves. How , many , did each person get?
                 [/INST] step 1: Let's define the variables. Let x be the number of seashells Carlos collected, y be the number of seashells Carrey collected.

step 2: We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected x + 5.

step 3: We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected x/2.

step 4: The total number of seashells they gathered together was x + x/2 + (x + 5) = 3x/2 + 5.

step 5: After gathering, they divided the seashells equally between themselves. So, each person got x/2 = y/3.

step 6: We have two equations related to x and y:
- x + x/2 + (x + 5) = 3x/2 + 5
- x/2 = y/3

step 7: To solve for x and y, we can first solve the equation x/2 = y/3 for x in terms of y: x = 2y/3.

step 8: Now we substitute x = 2y/3 into the first equation:
3x/2 + 5 = 3(2y/3) + 5
2x = 4y
x = 2y

step 9: Substituting x = 2y into the equation x/2 = y/3, we get y = x/2.

step 10: We can check that these values satisfy both equations:
2y + 2y/3 + (2y + 5) = 3(2y/3) + 5
2y + 2(2y/3) + 2y + 5 = 6y/3 + 5
2y(1 + 2/3 + 1) = 6y/3 + 5
3y = 6y/3 + 5
y = 5/3

x = 2y = 5/3 * 2 = 10/3

step 11: Since x = number of seashells Carlos collected, and x = 10/3, the final answer is:
{Carlos collected 10/3 = 3.33 (approximately) number of seashells}.</s>","Jim collected 27 seashells, 5 more than what Carlos collected, which means Carlos collected 27-5 = <<27-5=22>>22 seashells
Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey did, meaning Carrey collected 22/2 = <<22/2=11>>11 seashells
In total, they collected 27+22+11 = <<27+22+11=60>>60 seashells
They divided them into three equal group, getting 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 each

                 [/INST] Solution:

1. Mason eats 4 carrots each day from Monday to Friday. So, the number of carrots he eats in a week on weekdays is:
   Carrots on weekdays = Number of weekdays * Carrots per weekday
   = 5 * 4
   = 20 carrots

2. Mason eats 5 carrots each day on Saturday and Sunday. So, the number of carrots he eats in a week on weekends is:
   Carrots on weekends = Number of weekends * Carrots per weekend
   = 2 * 5
   = 10 carrots

3. To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends:
   Total carrots = Carrots on weekdays + Carrots on weekends
   = 20 + 10
   = 30 carrots

{The final answer is: Mason eats 30 carrots a week.}</s>","He would eat 4 x 5 =<<4*5=20>>20 on weekdays.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that the first song on the cassette is 5 minutes long.

Step 2: The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we can multiply the length of the first song by 1.6 (representing a 60% increase).

Step 3: Length of the first song = 5 minutes
Step 4: Length of the second song = 5 minutes * 1.6 = 8 minutes (approximately)

Step 5: To find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

Step 6: Total length of the cassette = Length of the first song + Length of the second song = 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

{The final answer is: The total length of the cassette is 13 minutes.}</s>","The second song is 5*.6=<<5*.6=3>>3 minutes longer than the first

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the selling price of the mobile device bought by Linus.
Since Linus sells each mobile device for twice the original price, the selling price is $20 * 2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.

Step 2: Find the profit for selling one mobile device.
Profit = Selling price - Buying price
Profit = $40 - $20 = $<<40-20=20>>20.

Step 3: Find the total profit earned by selling all the mobile devices bought last Monday and Tuesday.
Last Monday, Linus bought 2 devices.
Total profit from Monday's sales = 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.

Last Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices.
Total profit from Tuesday's sales = 4 * $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.

Step 4: Find the total profit earned in one week.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the information given in the problem and solve it step by step:

1. We know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Let's denote Carl's height as C. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 0.5 * C.
2. Carl is one foot taller than his brother Ned. Since we denoted Carl's height as C, then Ned's height is C - 1.
3. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. We were told that Isabel is 7 feet tall. Therefore, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Now that we have all the necessary information, let's calculate the length of Carl's cane:

1. Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, and we know that Carl is C feet tall and his cane is 0.5 * C feet long, we just need to find the value of C to get the answer.
2. We found that Ned, who is one foot shorter than Carl, is 5 feet tall. This means that Carl is 6 feet tall (Ned's height + 1 foot), so Carl's height is 6.
3. Now that we know Carl's height, we can calculate the length of his cane: 0.5 * 6 = 3 feet.

The final answer is that Carl's cane is 3 feet long.</s>","If Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, then Ned is 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 feet tall.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of bottles needed to meet the daily energy demands of one person.
Every bottle of Hortex carrot juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, the number of bottles needed to meet the energy demands of one person is 1 / 0.2 = 5 bottles.

Step 2: Determine the number of bottles needed to meet the daily energy demands of 2300 people.
To find the number of bottles needed to meet the daily energy demands of 2300 people, we simply multiply the number of bottles needed for one person by the total number of people: 5 bottles * 2300 people = 11,500 bottles.

Step 3: Determine the current daily production capacity and the additional production needed.
Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles of carrot juice per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the energy demands of 2300 people, we subtract their current production from the total number of bottles needed: 11,500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7,300 additional bottles.

{The final answer is: Hortex would need to produce an additional 7,300 bottles of juices every day to meet the daily energy needs of 2300 people.}</s>","Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.
So 2300 people, need 5 * 2300 = <<2300*5=11500>>11500 juices for this purpose.
To cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles of juices.

1. We have a total of 8 identical octuplets.
2. 3/4 of them wear purple, so we have 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies wearing purple.
3. 1/4 of them wear blue, so we have 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies wearing blue.
4. Among the blue-wearers, we know that all of them wear bows. So, we have 2 babies wearing blue and wearing bows.
5. Among the purple-wearers, we are told that 1/3 of them wear bows. So, we have 6 babies wearing purple, and 1/3 of them wear bows, which is 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies wearing purple and wearing bows.
6. Therefore, we have a total of 2 babies wearing blue with bows + 2 babies wearing purple with bows = 4 babies wearing bows.
7. We want to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. To calculate this, we need to divide the number of babies wearing purple and wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows.

                    question:

                 [/INST] Here's the step-by-step reasoning for this problem:

1. Tyrion changes his face (wears a mask) two times every time he goes out.
2. He goes out three times a day.
3. To find out how many mask changes he makes in two days, we first need to determine how many mask changes he makes in one day.
4. He goes out three times a day and changes his face twice each time, so he changes his face six times a day.
5. To find out how many mask changes he makes in two days, we need to multiply the number of mask changes he makes in one day by the number of days in two days.
6. We know there are 24 hours in a day, so three go-outs make up one day. Therefore, in two days, there are 2 * 24 = 48 hours.
7. Since he changes his face six times a day, in 48 hours he will change his face 6 * 48 = 288 times.
8. However, we are looking for the number of mask changes, not the number of face changes. Since each mask change corresponds to one face change, the number of mask changes he makes in two days is also 288.

{The final answer is 288 mask changes in two days.}</s>","Tyrion uses 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 face masks every day.
Therefore, the total number of face masks he uses every 2 days is 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, Cole hid:
   Cole hid 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 eggs in the yard.

2. Lamar found 5 eggs.
   So, Cole hid 36 - 5 = <<36-5=31>>31 eggs were still hidden after Lamar found his eggs.

3. Stacy found twice as many eggs as Lamar.
   Stacy found 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 eggs.
   So, after Stacy's discovery, there were 31 - 10 = <<31-10=21>>21 eggs still hidden.

4. Charlie found 2 fewer eggs than Stacy.
   Charlie found 21 - 2 = <<21-2=19>>19 eggs.
   So, once Charlie had finished searching, there were 21 - 19 = <<21-19=2>>2 eggs remaining.

5. Mei found half as many eggs as Charlie.
   Mei found half of 2 = <<0.5*2=1>>1 egg.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
Given that the first two complexes have 200 apartments each, and the third one is 60% bigger:
3rd complex apartments = 2 * 200 + 60% * 200
3rd complex apartments = 2 * 200 + 0.6 * 200
3rd complex apartments = 2 * 200 + 120 * 1
3rd complex apartments = 2 * 200 + 120
3rd complex apartments = 2 * 200 + 120 = 402 apartments

Step 2: Determine the number of collections made per week at each complex.
Collections per week = 3 collections * (number of complexes)
Collections per week = 3 collections * 3 = 9 collections

Step 3: Find the money John makes per week at one complex.
Money per week per complex = Collections per week * (number of apartments) * (money per apartment)
Money per week per complex = 9 collections * (200 apartments) * ($.40/apartment)
Money per week per complex = 9 * 200 * $.40 = $1440

Step 4: Find the money John makes per week in total.

How many total , fruits can , an avocado tree produce during its ! 10 years of : life?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the fruit production of each year-old avocado tree.
A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
A 6-year-old tree produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
A 7-year-old tree produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
A 8-year-old tree produces 200 * 50 - 50 = 950 fruits. (Subtracting 50 fruits from a 10-year-old tree production)
A 10-year-old tree produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Step 2: Identify the missing production during the ninth year for a 10-year-old tree.
Since a 10-year-old tree doesn't produce fruits during the ninth year, its total production during the first 9 years is 50 (year 1) + 150 (year 2) + 350 (year 3) + 950 (year 4) + 1000 (year 5) = 2950 fruits.

Step 3: Calculate the total production during the 10-year period for an avocado tree.
The total production during the first 9 years is 2950 fruits, and a 10-year-old tree produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits during the tenth year.
So the avocado tree produces a total of 2950 (years 1 to 9) + 1000 (year 10) = 3950 fruits during its 10-year life.

The final answer is: {An avocado tree produces 3950 fruits during its 10-year life.}</s>","At 5 years it produces 50 fruits
At 6 years it produces 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 fruits.

At 10 years, it produces 50 * 20 = <<50*20=1000>>1000 fruits
At 8 years, it produces 200 fewer fruits than at 10 years, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits
During 10 years, an avocado tree can produce a total of 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = <<50+150+350+800+1000=2350>>2350 fruits

                    question:
                    The red rope was ! four times the length of the ? blue rope. The blue rope . was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If the 3 ropes had a combined length ; of 37 centimeters, what was the length of the red rope in centimeters?
                 [/INST] To find the length of the red rope, we need to solve the system of equations given by the problem. Let's denote the length of the blue rope as x and the length of the yellow rope as y.

1. We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: red = 4x
2. We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: x < y
3. We know that the combined length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters: x + y + red = 37

To find the length of the red rope, we first need to find the lengths of the blue and yellow ropes. From statement 2, we know that x < y. We also know that x is the length of the blue rope and y is the length of the yellow rope. Since x is less than y, and both x and y represent lengths, they must have units of centimeters. So, we can assume that y is greater than x by some constant amount.

Let's assume that the difference between y and x is constant for all valid solutions to the problem. That is, let's assume that y = x + c, where c is some constant. We can now find the value of c.

From statement 3, we have x + y + red = 37. Substituting y = x + c, we get:

x + (x + c) + red = 37
2x + c + red = 37

We now have two equations: red = 4x and 2x + c + red = 37. Solving the first equation for red, we get:

red = 4x

Substituting red = 4x into the second equation, we get:

2x + c + 4x = 37
6x + c = 37
c = 37 - 6x

Now we have an expression for c in terms of x. But we don't know what x is. To find x, we can use the fact that x is the length of the blue rope and it is less than the length of the yellow rope, y. From statement 2, we have x < y, so x must be a positive number less than y.

Let's find the possible values of x by testing various values of y. For each value of y, we can find the corresponding value of x by solving the equation x < y.

For example, if we assume that y = 10 centimeters, then x must satisfy the inequality x < 10. The smallest value of x that satisfies this inequality is x = 1 centimeter.

Now we can find the length of the red rope using the equation red = 4x:

red = 4 * 1 = 4 centimeters

Note that we found one solution for this particular value of y. To find all valid solutions, we need to test other values of y.

{The final answer is: The length of the red rope is 4 centimeters.}

However, this solution may not be the only one. The problem may have multiple valid solutions, depending on the specific values of x and y that satisfy the given conditions. To find all valid solutions, we need to test various values of x and y, as described above.</s>","Let Y = the length of the yellow rope in centimeters
Blue rope = Y - 7
Red rope = 4 * (Y - 7)

6Y = 72
Y = <<12=12>>12 cm

                 [/INST] To find out how much money is left in Ronnie's account, we first need to determine how much money Rissa received. We know that Rissa received three times as much as Ronnie and that each of them gave an equal amount to their little sister, leaving Rissa with 4/5 of her money.

Let's denote the amount of money Ronnie received as x. Then the amount of money Rissa received is 3x. After each of them gave an equal amount to their little sister, Rissa was left with 4/5 of her money, that is:

3x - Equal_amount = 4/5 * 3x

To find the equal amount, we can subtract 4/5 of Rissa's money from her original amount and set it equal to Ronnie's money:

3x - (4/5 * 3x) = x

To solve for x, first find 4/5 * 3x (which is the amount of money Ronnie gave to his little sister):

4/5 * 3x = 3 * 2x

Simplify the equation:

2x = 3x - 3x/5

Solve for x:

x = 5 * (3x - 2x)/5
x = 3x - 2x
x = x

This equation has no solution, which means that there's no valid solution for this problem, as the given conditions contradict each other. {The final answer is undefined.}</s>","Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.

                    , A wall mural has four different colors ! of paint in it: red, white, purple, and . yellow.  There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural. Half the mural is ! yellow. If the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, how many pints ; of red paint was used?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of pints of each color as follows:

- Red = r
- White = w
- Purple = p
- Yellow = y

We know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural. Since half of the mural is yellow, we can write an equation representing the total amount of paint:

r + w + p + y = 12

Since red, white, and purple paints have equal amounts, we know that:

r = w = p

However, the problem states that half the mural is yellow, so yellow must have a different amount of paint. We can find out the difference between the amount of yellow paint compared to the other colors by subtracting the total amount of non-yellow paint from the total amount of paint:

Total paint = 12
Non-yellow paint = 3r (since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple)

y = Total paint - Non-yellow paint
y = 12 - 3r

We also know that half the mural is yellow. Let's find the number of pints of non-yellow paint:

Non-yellow paint = 3r
Total mural area = 2 * area for yellow paint

Let h be the height of the mural, and l be the length of one side of the equal squares of yellow paint. Therefore, there are 2l * h equal squares in the mural.

2l * h = Total mural area

Since half the mural is yellow, the area of yellow paint is:

Area for yellow paint = l * h

As we learned earlier, the non-yellow paint covers an area of 3r. Since the area of a square is equal to the side squared, we have:

(3r)² = (l * h)

Taking the square root of both sides:

√(3r)² = √(l * h)
3r = l * h

To find the value of r, we can use the given information that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, so r = w = p. Since half the mural is yellow, we have:

l² + (h - y)² = (l + y)²

Let's assume l = m (the side length of a square of non-yellow paint) and analyze the given information:

- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow, so yellow = 12 - 3r
- Since half the mural is yellow, this means that non-yellow paint covers half the total area, and each non-yellow square has side length m.

Taking the square root of both sides for this equation:

l² + (h - y)² = (l + y)²
l² + (h - (12 - 3r))² = (l + y)²

By expanding the terms we have following inequality:

l² + h² + y² - 2hy - 12l - 3r² + 2ry > l² + y² + (l + y)²

Simplifying the equation:

h² + 2hy - 12l + 2ry - 3r² > l + y + l² + y² - y

Let's set up variables we can utilize to find r:
Let x = h, y, and z = l.

Now we have:

x² + 2xz - 12z + 2rz - 3r² > z + z² - z + x + x² - x

Trying to eliminate one of the variables. We let z = l, then we have:

l² + 2xl - 12l + 2rl - 3r² > l + l² - l + x + x² - x

Subtracting l from both sides:

l² + 2xl - 12l + 2rl - 3r² - l - l² + l + x + x² - x

Simplifying further:

l² + 2xl + xl - 12l + 2rl + xl + xl - 3r² > 2xl + xl + xl + xl

Combining","Half the mural is yellow, so the other half took 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pints of paint.
The mural has equal amounts of the other three colors, so it used 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 pints of red paint.

Area of one bedroom = Length * Width
Area of one bedroom = 20 feet * 12 feet
Area of one bedroom = 240 square feet

Step 2: Calculate the area of the living room.
We know the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom.
Area of living room = 5 * Area of one bedroom
Area of living room = 5 * 240 square feet
Area of living room = 1200 square feet

Step 3: Calculate the area of the remaining part of the house.
We know the total area of the house is the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining part.
Total Area = Area of bedrooms + Area of living room + Area of remaining part
We've calculated the area of the bedrooms and the living room, so we need to find the area of the remaining part.
Area of remaining part = Total Area - Area of bedrooms - Area of living room
Area of remaining part = (Total Area) - (4 * Area of one bedroom) - Area of living room

Step 4: Plug the numbers into the equation and calculate the total area.
Area of remaining part = (1200 + 4 * 240 - 1200) square feet
Area of remaining part = 320 square feet

                 [/INST] Step 1: We are given that Alice counts 3 clouds on Monday.

Step 2: Each day after Monday, she sees double the number of clouds as the previous day. So we have:

Tuesday: 2 * 3 = 6 clouds
Wednesday: 2 * 6 = 12 clouds
Thursday: 2 * 12 = 24 clouds
Friday: 2 * 24 = 48 clouds

Step 3: To find the total number of clouds Alice counts in a week, we add up the number of clouds she counts each day:

3 clouds (Monday) + 6 clouds (Tuesday) + 12 clouds (Wednesday) + 24 clouds (Thursday) + 48 clouds (Friday) = 113 clouds

Final answer: {The final answer is 113 clouds}</s>","On Monday Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds in the sky, and double that on Tuesday, 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 puffs of clouds.
On Wednesday she sees twice that amount, 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 puffs of clouds.
On Thursday she sees twice that amount, 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 puffs of clouds.
On Friday she sees twice the amount of the day before, 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 puffs of clouds.
In total, across all five days, she sees 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = <<3+6+12+24+48=93>>93 total cloud puffs.

                    question:
                    A regular box of 100 dishwasher pods ! costs $12. There's currently a special size box for the same price that has 20% more pods. How many dishwashing cycles ; with the new box can you : run for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of dishwasher pods in the regular box and the special box.

In the regular box, there are 100 pods.

The special box has 20% more pods than the regular box. So the number of pods in the special box is:

Number of pods in special box = number of pods in regular box × (1 + 0.20)
Number of pods in special box = 100 × 1.20
Number of pods in special box = 120 pods

Step 2: Find out how many dishwasher cycles can be run with the pods in the special box if one pod is used per cycle and the cost is $1.

The cost of one regular box is $12. Since we have a special box with 20% more pods, the cost per pod is lower. To find the cost per pod in the special box, we can divide the cost of the regular box by the number of pods in it:

Cost per pod in regular box = $12 / 100 pods = $0.12/pod

Since the special box has 20% more pods, the cost per pod in the special box is 20% lower, which is:

Cost per pod in special box = $0.12/pod × (1 - 0.20)
Cost per pod in special box = $0.12/pod × 0.8
Cost per pod in special box = $0.096/pod

Now we can calculate how many cycles can be run with the pods in the special box at a cost of $1:

Number of cycles = cost / cost per pod
Number of cycles = $1 / $0.096/pod
Number of cycles ≈ 10.42

However, since you can't run a fraction of a cycle, we can only consider running 10 cycles with the pods in the special box and having $0 left for the next cycle. Additionally, the number of cycles calculated above is an approximation because of the rounding involved in the calculation. In reality, there are exactly 10 full cycles that can be run with the special box, producing a total of 10 x 100 = 1000 dishwasher pods.

So, the final answer is {You can run 10 full dishwasher cycles with the special box at $1 each}.</s>","If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods
If the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods
If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10
If 1 cycle costs $0.10, then for $1 I could run $1/$0.1 = 10 cycles

Step 2: Thomas loses 10 bills. So, he now has 50 - 10 = <<50-10=40>>40 bills.

Step 3: Thomas uses half of his remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 bills is 40 / 2 = <<40/2=20>>20 bills. So, Thomas has 40 - 20 = <<40-20=20>>20 bills left.

Step 4: Thomas triples his money. To find out how much money Thomas now has, we multiply the number of bills he has left by $20 (the value of each bill). This gives us 20 bills * $20 = $<<20*20=400>>400. Since Thomas tripled his money, he now has 3 times $400 = $<<3*400=1200>>1200.

Step 5: Thomas converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills Thomas now has, we divide the total amount of money he has by $5 (the value of each new 5 dollar bill). This gives us $1200 / $5 = $<<1200/5=240>>240 bills.

He triples his money which gives him 20*3=<<20*3=60>>60 bills

Step 2: In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals that team B scores in the second half. Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so in the second half, team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Therefore, in the second half, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals (since 1/4 * 8 = 2).

Step 3: To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we add the number of goals scored by both teams in both halves. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals and team B scores 2 goals, so the total number of goals scored in the first half is 4 + 2 = 6 goals. In the second half, team A scores 2 goals and team B scores 8 goals, so the total number of goals scored in the second half is 2+8 = 10 goals.

                    A teacher uses , a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard ? for his students.

If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he . have . before he has to recycle this piece?
                 [/INST] To find out how many days the teacher can use the current piece of chalk before recycling it, we first need to determine how much chalk is left.

On Monday, the teacher used 45% of a new 5-inch piece of chalk. This means that:

Used chalk length = Initial length * Percentage used
= 5 inches * 0.45
= 2.25 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we will find out how many days he can use the remaining chalk by writing with 20% of the current length each day.

Length of chalk left = 2.25 inches - (2 days * 0.20 * 5 inches)

Now calculate the length of chalk left after 2 days of using 20% of the current chalk length each day:

Step 1: Find the length of chalk used in 2 days when writing with 20% of the current length each day.
Chalk length used per day = 20% of 2.25 inches = 0.45 inches
Chalk length used in 2 days = 2 days * 0.45 inches = 0.9 inches

Step 2: Subtract the chalk length used from the current length of chalk left:
Length of chalk left = 2.25 inches - 0.9 inches = 1.35 inches

Keep subtracting the used chalk length at 20% per day until the chalk is smaller than 2 inches:

While chalk length > 2 inches:
Next day's chalk length = Length of chalk left - Chalk length used per day
                                 = 1.35 inches - 0.27 inches (20% of 1.35 inches)
                                 = 1.08 inches

Now check the final length:
Length of chalk left < 2 inches

Therefore, the teacher has used the chalk for 5 days in total. He used a new piece on Monday and wrote more than usual, which is why he used up more than 20% of the chalk on that day. However, he can continue writing with the remaining chalk for 4 more days until it's recycled (when the length is less than 2 inches).

{The final answer is: The teacher can write with the current piece of chalk for a total of 5 days, including the extra day on Monday.}</s>","The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
Since 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of bags required for 850 kilos of coal.
Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight of each bag
Number of bags = 850 kg / 50 kg
Number of bags = 17 bags (with a remainder)
 However, since coal is sold in 50 kg bags, Ali must round up and buy 18 bags to have enough coal for his 850 kg order.

Step 2: Find the cost of one bag of coal.
Cost of one bag = Price per unit * Weight of one bag
Cost of one bag = $18/unit * 50 kg
Cost of one bag = $900

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of Ali's order.
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost of one bag
Total Cost = 18 bags * $900

                 [/INST] To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat.

1. Cheese pizza slices consumed by 6 friends:
   Number of friends = 6
   Cheese pizza slices per friend = 6
   Total cheese pizza slices = Friends × Cheese pizza slices per friend
   = 6 × 6 = 36

2. Pepperoni pizza slices consumed by 6 friends:
   Number of friends = 6
   Pepperoni pizza slices per friend = 4
   Total pepperoni pizza slices = Friends × Pepperoni pizza slices per friend
   = 6 × 4 = 24

Now, we will calculate how many slices one pizza pie contains in total:

1. Total slices in one cheese pizza pie:
   Cheese pizza slices per pie = 12

2. Total slices in one pepperoni pizza pie:
   Pepperoni pizza slices per pie = 8

Next, we will calculate the number of each type of pizza pie Kate needs to buy:

1. Number of cheese pizza pies needed:
   Total cheese pizza slices needed = 36
   Cheese pizza slices per pie = 12
   Number of cheese pizza pies = Total cheese pizza slices needed ÷ Cheese pizza slices per pie
   = 36 ÷ 12 = 3

2. Number of pepperoni pizza pies needed:
   Total pepperoni pizza slices needed = 24
   Pepperoni pizza slices per pie = 8
   Number of pepperoni pizza pies = Total pepperoni pizza slices needed ÷ Pepperoni pizza slices per pie
   = 24 ÷ 8 = 3

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizza pies and 3 pepperoni pizza pies for her friends.

Sam ran 5 miles on each of these days, so the total miles for these days is:
5 miles/day * 2 days = 10 miles

Step 3: Add the miles Sam ran on each day to find the total miles for the week.
Total miles run in a week = Miles run on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday + Miles run on Tuesday and Thursday

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes Jay to make 60 snowballs, we need to determine how many snowballs he can make during a specific time frame, while also accounting for the ones that melt.

1. Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour.
2. Two snowballs melt every 15 minutes, meaning that 4 snowballs melt in an hour (since there are 2 hours in an hour and a half, and 2 snowballs melt every hour and a half).

Now let's calculate how many snowballs Jay can make in an hour, considering the melting:

1. Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour.
2. 4 snowballs melt in an hour.
3. Therefore, Jay can make a total of 16 snowballs per hour that don't melt.

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Jay to make 60 snowballs, given that he can make 16 snowballs per hour that don't melt:

1. Jay can make 16 snowballs per hour that don't melt.
2. He needs to make 60 snowballs (20 that he starts with and 40 more).
3. To find out how long it takes him to make the additional 40 snowballs, we need to divide the number of snowballs he needs to make by the number of snowballs he can make per hour: 40 ÷ 16 = 2.5 hours.
4. However, since Jay works for only full hours, he needs a little extra time to make the last 4 snowballs: 2.5 hours × 60 minutes = 150 minutes.

Therefore, {The final answer is: It will take Jay 150 minutes to have 60 snowballs}. This is equal to 2 hours and 30 minutes.</s>","Every hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs.
At the same time, each hour 2 * 60/15 = <<2*60/15=8>>8 snowballs melt.
This means that each hour, Jay ends up with 20 – 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 more snowballs.
It will take Jay 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 hours to create enough snowballs.

                    question:
                    Digimon had its 20th ? anniversary. :  When it came out John ! was twice ? as : old as Jim.  If John is 28 now how old , is Jim?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Digimon had its 20th anniversary. Let's find out when that was.

2. We are told that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. We are given that John is currently 28 years old.

3. Let's find out how old Jim was when Digimon came out. Since John was twice as old as Jim back then, we can represent the age difference between them as 2John = Jim.

4. Now we need to find the year Digimon came out. Let's call ""x"" the number of years since Digimon came out. We have: 2(John's age during Digimon) = Jim's age during Digimon.

5. We know that John's current age is 28, so John's age during Digimon is 28 - x (since x represents the number of years that have passed since then). We can write the equation: 2(28 - x) = Jim's age during Digimon.

6. To find Jim's age during Digimon, we'll first find out the value of Jim's age during Digimon from the given equation. We can start by solving for x:

   2(28 - x) = Jim's age during Digimon
   2 * (28 - x) = Jim's age during Digimon
   2 * 28 - 2 * x = Jim's age during Digimon
   56 - 2x = Jim's age during Digimon

7. Now we need to isolate x. We can do this by adding 2x to both sides:

   56 = Jim's age during Digimon + 2x

8. To find x, we'll subtract 2 * Jim's age during Digimon from both sides:

   56 - 2 * Jim's age during Digimon = x
   56 - 2(56 - 2x) = x

9. Distributing the 2 on the left side, we get:

   56 - 112 + 2x = x
    -56 + 2x = x
    x = 2x - 56

10. Solving for x, we get:

    x = 2x - 56
    3x = 56
    x = 18.67 ( approximation)
    Since x has to be the number of years, it must be a whole number. If we round down, Jim was 18 when Digimon came out.

11. Since Jim was 18 when Digimon came out, we can find his current age by subtracting the number of years that have passed since then:

    Jim's current age = Jim's age during Digimon's anniversary - (Number of years that have passed)

12. We found that Jim was 18 when Digimon came out and 28 currently. So,

    Jim's current age = 18 + (28 - 18) = 28.

{The final answer is: Jim was born in the year of Digimon's 18th anniversary, and he is currently 28 years old.}</s>","When Digimon came out John would have been 28-20=<<28-20=8>>8
So Jim was 8/2=<<8/2=4>>4 years old

Step 2: On the third day, they ordered two packs, so each pack still contains 50 bandages.

Step 3: We're told that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. To find out how many bandages they used on the third day, subtract the number of bandages they had at the end of the third day from the number they had at the beginning of the day (ignoring the bandages they ordered): 78 (bandages left) - 50 (bandages in one pack ordered) = 28 bandages used on the third day.

Step 4: We know that they used ten fewer bandages on the second day than they did on the first day. So on the second day, they used 38 (bandages used on the first day) - 10 = 28 bandages.

Step 5: Now, we want to find out how many bandages they had at the beginning of the first day. The total number of bandages they used on the first two days is 38 (on the first day) + 28 (on the second day) = 64 bandages. Since they ordered one pack of 50 bandages on the first day, they must have started with 50 bandages more than they used: 64 (total bandages used) + 50 = 114 bandages.

{The final answer is 114 bandages}.</s>","Let B be the number of bandages the nurses’ station started with.

                 [/INST] Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. So, she bought a total of 5 × 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 red pens.
2. She also bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. We know that there are 25 red pens, so there must be 2 × 25 = <<2*25=50>>50 black pens.
3. Each pack of black pens contains 5 pens, so Alain's mom bought a total of 50 × 5 = <<50*5=250>>250 black pens.
4. Alain now has both the red and black pens. Let's find the total number of pens Alain has.
5. We know that Alain has 25 red pens, and his mom bought him 250 black pens, so he has a total of 25 red pens + 250 black pens = <<25+250=275>>275 pens.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of bottles John buys for cognac as x. Therefore, he buys 10 bottles for scotch and 2x bottles for cognac.

1. The cost of scotch is $600 for 10 bottles.
   - Therefore, the cost for one bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

2. John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which is 2 * 10 = 20 bottles.

3. The cost of cognac is 50% more per bottle compared to scotch.
   - So, the cost for one bottle of cognac is $60 * 1.5 = $90.

4. The cost of cognac for 20 bottles is $90 * 20 = $1800.

5. The total cost for scotch and cognac is $600 for scotch + $1800 for cognac = $2400.

 x = 2 * 20 = 40

So, on the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Step 2: On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees and 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day.

The number of White Oak trees planted on the second day is 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30.

To find the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day, we need to find 1/4 more than what was planted on the first day:

1/4 * (20 White Oak trees * 2 + 40 Lodgepole Pine trees) = 1/4 * (40 + 40) = 1/4 * 80 = 32

So, on the second day, Mr. Julius planted 30 White Oak trees and 40 + 32 = <<40+32=72>>72 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Step 3: To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days, we add the trees planted on each day:

 Total number of trees = 20 White Oak trees (Day 1) + 40 Lodgepole Pine trees (Day 1) + 30 White Oak trees (Day 2) + 72 Lodgepole Pine trees (Day 2)

 Total number of trees = 20 + 40 + 30 + 72 = 122

At the same time, he increased the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted by 1/4 * 40 trees = <<1/4*40=10>>10 trees on the second day.
The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted by Mr. Julius on the second day is 10 trees + 40 trees = <<10+40=50>>50 trees

1. Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.
2. His children consumed 4 gallons, leaving 20 gallons.
3. On the second day, his wife accidentally spilled 7 gallons, reducing the amount to 13 gallons.
4. Ronnie, Fred's friend, consumed 5 gallons, leaving 8 gallons available.
5. On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party.
6. If they shared the remaining root beer equally, each person would drink 8 gallons / 3 people = 2.67 gallons. However, since it's unlikely that they'd want to measure out their drinks to be exactly this amount, a more reasonable solution is to assume they drink a whole gallon each (considering they attended a party).
7. So, in this case, the 8 gallons would provide 8 servings.

The final answer is: Each person at the party could have had 1 gallon to drink, making a total of 8 gallons (or 8 servings) available.</s>","Fred started with 24 gallons, but on day 1, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24-4=<<24-4=20>>20 gallons of root beer.
On day two, Barbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20-7=<<20-7=13>>13 gallons of root beer.
On day three, Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons, leaving 13-5=<<13-5=8>>8 gallons of root beer for the party.
Three guests joined Fred for the party, resulting in 3+1=<<3+1=4>>4 party goers.

1. The total number of fish is 66.
2. One-third of the fish have red stripes, so:
   Fish with red stripes = Total number of fish * (1/3)
   = 66 * (1/3)
   = 22 fish

3. The remaining fish have blue stripes. We know that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, so:
   Fish with blue stripes = Remaining fish * (5/11)
   Since we know the number of fish with red stripes, we can find the number of remaining fish (with blue stripes) by subtracting the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish:
   Remaining fish = Total number of fish - Fish with red stripes
   = 66 - 22 = 44 fish
   Fish with blue stripes = 44 * (5/11)

Step 2: She also had 3 makeup sets, each with 6 eyeshadow colors. So she had 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 additional eyeshadow colors.
Step 3: One of the palettes was stolen, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors.
Step 4: She used up half of the colors in one makeup set. Since each set had 6 colors, she used up 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 eyeshadow colors.
Step 5: After the theft and using up half of one makeup set, Amy has 8 (from the palettes) - 4 (lost palette) + 12 (from the remaining makeup sets) - 3 (used from one makeup set) = <<8-4+12-3=17>>17 eyeshadow colors left.

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. His house is 7 times as high as he is. So the house's height is 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches.
3. The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is three times Mattison's height. So the floor to ceiling height on the first floor is 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches.
4. To find the height of the roof from the second floor, we first need to find the height of the first floor. Since the house's height is the sum of the heights of the two floors and the ceiling height between them, we have 420 inches = Height of first floor + 180 inches (ceiling height) + Height of second floor.
5. Solving for the height of the second floor: 420 inches - 180 inches - 180 inches = 160 inches
6. Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the height of the second floor minus the floor to ceiling height on the second floor. We know the floor to ceiling height on the second floor is the same as on the first floor, which is three times Mattison's height or 180 inches. So the height of the roof is 160 inches - 180 inches = -20 inches.
7. Since the height can't be negative, there's an error in the problem or the information provided isn't sufficient for a valid answer.

Therefore, we can't determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor in inches with the given information.</s>","Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.

                 [/INST] To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we first need to determine how many shells were found by teams Alphas and The Finders.

Let's denote the total number of shells found by all three teams as S. We'll find out how many shells were found by each team and then calculate team Gogetters' contribution.

1. Team Alphas found 40% of the shells:
   Shells_Alphas = 0.4 * S

2. Team The Finders found 60% of the remaining shells. Let R represent the number of shells found by Team Alphas:
   Shells_TheFinders = 0.6 * (S - R)

Since we don't have a specific value for S yet, let's assume there are 1000 shells in the parking lot for simplicity.

Shells_Alphas = 0.4 * 1000 = 400

Now we can calculate how many shells Team The Finders found:

Shells_TheFinders = 0.6 * (1000 - 400) = 600

The total number of shells found by teams Alphas and The Finders is 400 + 600 = 1000. However, we know that the initial number of shells in the parking lot was 700. This implies that there is a discrepancy of 300 shells. This may be due to errors in estimating the number of shells, losing some shells, or other errors. However, we cannot accurately determine how many shells Team Gogetters found based on the information provided, as their share was not specified as a percentage or an actual number of shells.

The third needs ? to ? walk 3 miles. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per . day. How . many miles ; does the last dog : need?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Bernie has 4 dogs.
2. The first dog needs 1 mile of exercise per day.
3. The second dog needs 4 miles of exercise per day.
4. The third dog needs an unknown amount of exercise, with the only given information being that it is between 1 and 3 miles.
5. On average, they all need 3 miles of exercise per day.

Now let's analyze the information given to find the required exercise for the fourth (last) dog.

First, let's calculate the total exercise needed by the first three dogs: 1 mile (for the first dog) + 4 miles (for the second dog) + (1 to 3 miles for the third dog). Since the third dog needs at least 1 mile and at most 3 miles, we can assume an average of 2 miles for simplicity (as the total will remain the same). So, the total exercise needed by the first three dogs is 1 + 4 + 2 = 7 miles per day.

We know that, on average, the four dogs need 3 miles of exercise per day. So, the exercise requirement for the last (fourth) dog would be the difference between the total exercise needed by all four dogs and the exercise already accounted for (for the first three dogs). That would be: 7 miles (total exercise for the first three dogs) - 3 miles (average exercise per day for all four dogs) = 4 miles.

{The final answer is: The last dog needs 4 miles of exercise per day.}</s>","The total walk distance must be 12 miles because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12
The first three walk a total of 8 miles because 1 + 4 + 3 = <<1+4+3=8>>8
The last one needs 4 miles because 12 - 8 = <<12-8=4>>4

Step 2: John uses 60% of the loan value to pay off his debts.

amount_paid_to_debts = 0.6 * $100,000

Step 3: Subtract the amount paid to debts from the loan value to find out how much money is left over.

remaining_money = loan_value - amount_paid_to_debts

                 [/INST] To find Trinity's profit, we first need to determine the price at which she sold the magazines. We know that she sells each magazine for 11/8 of the price she paid.

Let x be the price she paid for each magazine.
The price she sells each magazine for is 11/8 x.

Since Trinity bought a total of $72 worth of magazines, we can set up the equation:

x * (number of magazines) = $72

To find the number of magazines she bought with $72, we can divide both sides of the equation by x:

(number of magazines) = $72 / x

Now, we know that she sells each magazine for 11/8 of the price she paid. We can also set up an equation relating the selling price to the number of magazines:

(price she sells each magazine) * (number of magazines) = $72

(11/8 x) * (number of magazines) = $72

To find the number of magazines she sold, we can divide both sides by (11/8 x):

(number of magazines) = ($72) / ((11/8) x)

We can simplify this equation by crossing out common terms:

(number of magazines) = (8/11) * ($72 / x)

To find the number of magazines, we would need to know the exact value of x (the price she paid for each magazine). Since that information wasn't provided, we cannot determine the exact number of magazines she sold or her profit.

First, let's find the water removed per day on each setting:

1. Low setting: Removes 1 liter of water per day
2. Medium setting: Removes twice the amount of water as the low setting, so 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day
3. High setting: Removes twice the amount of water as the medium setting, so 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day

Next, we need to find the water removed during each phase:

1. Low setting for 3 days: 3 days * 1 liter/day = 3 liters
2. Medium setting for 3 days: 3 days * 2 liters/day = 6 liters
3. High setting for 5 days: 5 days * 4 liters/day = 20 liters

Now, we can find the total water removed during all periods:

Total water removed = Water removed on low setting + Water removed on medium setting + Water removed on high setting

Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high)

Total water removed = 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total volume of the jar in cubic inches.
The jar has a square base with side length 6 inches, and it is 15 inches tall. Therefore, the volume of the jar is:

Volume = base^2 * height = 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 216 * 15 = 3240 cubic inches

Step 2: Estimate the number of jelly beans in the jar based on the given information.
First, we need to calculote the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar based on the known efficienc and the number of jelly beans that are red. Since Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red, and knowing that one jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can calculate the number of jelly beans in the jar:

Volume of jelly beans = Total jar volume
Let N be the number of jelly beans in the jar
N = 3240 cubic inches

Number of non-red jelly beans = 0.7 * N (since 30% are red)
Number of red jelly beans = 0.3 * N

We want to find N, so we set up the equation:
N = Number of red jelly beans + Number of non-red jelly beans
N = 0.3 * N + 0.7 * N
N = 1 * N + 0.9 * N
N = 1.9 * N (1.9 times the number of jelly beans is equal to the total number of jelly beans)

Solving for N, we get: N = 3240 cubic inches / 1.9 ≈ 1705 cubic inches (rounded down to the nearest integer, since the number of jelly beans must be an integer).

Now, let's find out how many red jelly beans there are:

Number of red jelly beans = 0.3 * N = 0.3 * 1705 ≈ 511.5 ≈ 512 red jelly beans

Step 3: Find the absolute difference between Tim's estimate and the actual number of red jelly beans.

Difference = |Actual number of red jelly beans - Tim's guess|
Difference = |512 - ?|

To find Tim's guess, let X be the number of red jelly beans Tim guessed:
X = Percentage of red jelly beans * Total number of jelly beans
X = 0.3 * N
X = 0.3 * 1705 ≈ 511.5 ≈ 512

Therefore, Tim's guess was the same as the actual number of red jelly beans in the jar.

So, {The final answer is: Tim's guess was exactly the same as the actual number of red jelly beans (512), so there was no error in his guess.}</s>","The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches
That means it can fit 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans
With 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there
So that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red
So his guess is off by 900-864=<<900-864=36>>36

1. Initially, there were 20 people on the bus (when it departed Chengli city).
2. At the first station, 40 people entered the bus, so the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = <<20+40=60>>60.
3. At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who had entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Therefore, the number of new passengers who entered the bus at the second station was (3/4)*60 = <<3/4*60=45>>45.
4. Thus, the total number of people on the bus after the second station was 60 (initial passengers) + 45 (new passengers) = <<60+45=105>>105.
5. Since the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station compared to the second station, the number of passengers on the bus after the third station was 105 (people after the second station) * 2 = <<105*2=210>>210.
6. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, and 185 people had already gotten on (20 initial passengers + 45 passengers from the first station + 100 passengers who came on between the second and third stations), so there are still 200 - 185 = <<200-185=15>>15 spaces available on the bus.
7. However, since the number of passengers on the bus doubled between the second and third stations, the number of new passengers who came on between the second and third stations must also have been double the number of new passengers who came on between the first and second stations. That is, 100 new passengers came on between the second and third stations.
8. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus when it is full is 185 (initial passengers and passengers from the first and second stations) + 100 (new passengers between the second and third stations) = <<185+100=285>>285.
9. Since there are only 15 empty seats left on the bus, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 285 (total number of people on the bus when it is full) - 185 (total number of passengers already on the bus) = <<285-185=100>>100.

{The final answer is: 100}.</s>","If the number of passengers increased by 3/4 times the number that entered the bus on the first station, 3/4 * 40 people = <<3/4*40=30>>30 people entered the bus on the second station.
After the second station, the number of people on the bus was 20 people initially on the bus + 40 who entered at the first station + 30 who entered at the second station= <<20+40+30=90>>90 people.
The number of people doubled at the third station, which is 90 people * 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 people.
If the bus has a capacity of 200, the number of people required to fill the bus is 200 people - 180 people = <<200-180=20>>20 people

                    Pauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year. The cost ? of . one visit is $2. After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued ! to go to the museum for 3 more years. How much ; did Pauline spend on all visits ? to ! the ! museum?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of one visit after a 150% increase.
A 150% increase on a cost of $2 is a multiplication of $2 by 1.5 (because 1 + 1.5 = 1.5, which equals a 150% increase): {Cost of one visit after 5 years = $2 * 1.5 = $3}

Step 2: Calculate the number of visits Pauline made in total.
Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year for 8 years: {Total number of visits = 3 visits/year * 8 years = 24 visits}

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Pauline spent on her visits in the first 5 years.
Cost of one visit in the first 5 years = $2, so the total cost in the first 5 years is: {Total cost in first 5 years = 5 years * 3 visits/year * $2/visit = $30}

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Pauline spent on her visits in the last 3 years.
Cost of one visit in the last 3 years = $3, so the total cost in the last 3 years is: {Total cost in last 3 years = 3 years * 3 visits/year * $3/visit = $18}

Step 5: Calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum.
Total cost = Cost in first 5 years + Cost in last 3 years: {Total cost = $30 + $18 = $48}

The final answer is: {Pauline spent $48 on all visits to the museum}</s>","Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.
That means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.
After 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.
That means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.
So for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
During the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
In total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes for everyone to try the escape room, we first need to find out how many students can try it in one go (8) and how many students qualify for attempting it each year (10 per grade x 7 grades).

1. Calculate the number of students who can try the escape room in one session: 8 students
2. Determine the number of students who qualify for attempting it each year: 10 students per grade x 7 grades = 70 students
3. Find out how many sessions are needed for all students to try the escape room: 70 students / 8 students per session = 8.75 sessions
4. Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a session, we must arrange for an additional session: 9 sessions in total
5. Determine the total time required for one session: 45 minutes
6. Calculate the total time required to complete sessions for all students: 9 sessions x 45 minutes = 405 minutes
7. Convert 405 minutes to hours: 405 minutes / 60 minutes = 6.75 hours

{The final answer is: It takes 6.75 hours for everyone to try the escape room.}</s>","There are 4 grades in the middle school x 10 students = <<4*10=40>>40 students who get to try the escape room.
There will be 40 students / 8 students in a group = <<40/8=5>>5 groups who get to try the escape room.

                 [/INST] To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the cost of the tables and roof frames that John manufactured for Ali. Let's break it down step by step:

1. John manufactured 4 wooden tables for Ali. The cost of each table is $20.
2. So, the total cost of tables for Ali is: 4 (tables) x $20 (cost per table) = $80.
3. John also manufactured 2 roof frames for Ali, and the cost of each roof frame is $10.
4. So, the total cost of roof frames for Ali is: 2 (roof frames) x $10 (cost per roof frame) = $20.
5. The total amount Ali has to pay John is the sum of the costs of tables and roof frames.
6. Therefore, the final answer is: $80 (tables) + $20 (roof frames) = $100.

{The final answer is: $100.}</s>","For the wooden table, Ali should pay: $20 * 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80
For the roof frames, Ali should pay: $10 * 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20

                 [/INST] Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so its length is 4x.

The total length of the board is given as 40 feet. Therefore, the length of the shorter piece and the longer piece must add up to 40 feet.

We have the equation:
x + 4x = 40

Combining the terms on the left side:
5x = 40

Now, we can find the value of x by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:
x = 8

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. To find the length of the longer piece, we can substitute the value of x back into the equation:

The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece:
4x = 4 * 8 = 32 feet

{The final answer is: The longer piece is 32 feet long.}</s>","Let x be the length of the shorter piece.
The two pieces are 4x and x in length.
The equation is 4x + x = 40 when the lengths of the two boards are added.
Adding like terms makes the equation 5x = 40.
Then dividing 40 by 5 gives the value of x which is <<40/5=8>>8.
Since x =8, the longer piece is 4*8 = 32.

If he wants to make 80 meatballs for the cookout, how ! much of his secret seasoning will he need?
                 [/INST] To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he'll need. Since 1 pound of meat yields 16 meatballs, and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we have:

Weight of ground beef = Desired number of meatballs * Weight of meat per pound
= 80 meatballs * 1 lb
= 80 lbs

Now we can calculate how much seasoning he'll need:

Amount of seasoning = Weight of ground beef * Amount of seasoning per pound
= 80 lbs * 2 tbsp/lb
= 160 tbsp

However, since a tablespoon contains approximately 3 tbsp. of seasoning (this depends on the specific brand or measurement), we must account for the conversion.

Total seasoning needed = Original calculated amount * Conversion factor
= 160 tbsp/8 * 3 tbsp/tbsp
≈ 120 tbsp (or approximately 12 cups)

Therefore:
{The final answer is: Approximately 12 cups of seasoning is needed for the cookout.}</s>","To make 80 meatballs, Aiden will need 80 / 16 = <<80/16=5>>5 pounds of meat.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the number of cupcakes as x, and the number of brownies as y. We know that y = 3x - 2.

Step 2: Each person in Carly's class gets two treats, so the total number of treats she needs to make is 5 people * 2 treats / person = 10 treats.

Step 3: Since each person gets a cupcake and a brownie, the total number of cupcakes and brownies combined is 2 * 5 = 10 treats.

Step 4: We know that there are x cupcakes and y brownies, so x + y = 10.

Step 5: Now we have a system of two equations: x = a, y = 3x - 2.

Step 6: To find the number of cupcakes, we need to solve this system of equations. Since x is a constant (being the number of cupcakes), we can find its value by solving for y in the second equation and then using the first equation to check if the solution satisfies both equations.

Step 7: Let's find the value of y: y = 3x - 2. To satisfy x = a, y = 3a - 2.

Step 8: We can check the solution by plugging it back into our first equation: x + y = 10. a + (3a - 2) = 10.

Step 9: Simplifying the equation: a + 3a - 2 = 10. 4a - 2 = 10.

Step 10: Solving the equation for a, 4a - 2 = 10, we get a = 3. So, x = 3 and y = 3x - 2 = 3*3 - 2 = 7.

Step 11: Now we know that Carly made 3 cupcakes, but since the question asks for the number of cupcakes Carly made, it's likely a typo or missing information, and we should have had x = 5 instead of x = 3 in our calculations.

Step 12: Therefore, based on the available information, Carly should have made {5 cupcakes} to provide each person in her art class with two treats.</s>","First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats
Next, express the number of brownies in terms of the number of cupcakes based on the problem information: b = 3c - 2, where b is the number of brownies and c is the number of cupcakes
We know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10
Now we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10

                 [/INST] Let's go through this step by step:

1. Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year. So she gets 3 magazines * 12issues/magazine/year = 36 issues/year.
2. She also has one magazine that sends 6 issues a year. So she gets 1 magazine * 6issues/magazine/year = 6 issues/year from this magazine.
3. The last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of issues of the 6 issues magazine. So it sends her 6issues/magazine * 4 = 24 issues/year.
4. Therefore, the total number of issues Susan gets every year is 36 (from 3 magazines that send 12 issues/year) + 6 (from the magazine that sends 6 issues/year) + 24 (from the magazine that sends 4 times more issues) = 66 issues/year.
5. Since she gets one year's worth of issues from each magazine, the total number of magazines she has is the number of issues she gets divided by the number of issues per magazine per year. So the number of magazines is 66issues/year / 12issues/magazine/year = 5.5 magazines/year.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Shelley has 12! more paintings than Samantha, and Samantha has 27 paintings. To find out how many paintings Shelley has, we need to calculate 12! and add it to the number of paintings Samantha has:
   12! = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1
   12! = 479,001,600

   Shelley's number of paintings = Samantha's number of paintings + 12!
   Shelley's number of paintings = 27 + 479,001,600

2. We also know that Kim has 8 paintings more than Samantha. So, we'll find the number of paintings Kim has by adding 8 to the number of paintings Samantha has:

   Kim's number of paintings = Samantha's number of paintings + 8
   Kim's number of paintings = 27 + 8

The final answer is:

Step 1: Find the price of the toy in December after the price increase.
The toy cost $40 in November. In December, the price increased by 80%:

Price in December = $40 * (1 + 0.8)
Price in December = $40 * (1.8)
Price in December = $72

Step 2: Find the price of the toy in January after the discount.
In January, the price decreased by 50%:

Price in January = Price in December * (1 - 0.5)
Price in January = $72 * (0.5)
Price in January = $36

{The final answer is: The price of the toy in January after the discount was $36.}</s>","In November, the toy's price was $<<40=40>>40.
The 80% increment represents 40*0.8=$32

Now, we can solve for x. First, we need to get the x term on the left side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 20/4 from both sides:

20 - x = 20/4
20 - x = 5

Now, to find the value of x, we need to isolate the term with x. To do this, we'll subtract 5 from both sides:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of apples Walter ate.
1. Walter ate 2/5 of the 60 apples.
2. So, Walter ate 60 × 2/5 = 48 apples.
3. {Walter ate 48 apples}.

Step 2: Find the number of apples left after eating.
1. Walter had 60 apples initially and ate 48.
2. So, he had 60 - 48 = 12 apples left.
3. {Walter had 12 apples left}.

Step 3: Find the number of apples given to his sister.
1. Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples.
2. So, he gave her 12 × 1/4 = 3 apples.
3. {Walter gave his sister 3 apples}.

2. He later earned $27 from selling the remaining apples.
3. So, his total money received = Initial payment - Cost of apples + Earned money = $xx - $36 + $27 = $xx
4. By calculating the initial payment, we find that Walter paid $36 for the initial 60 apples.
5. Therefore, his total money received = $36 - $36 + $27 = $27.

Step 2: The problem then states that 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year is equal to the number of novels she wrote last year (3 quarters of X = 9).

Step 3: To solve for X (the number of novels she wrote this year), we first need to find 3 quarters of X. We know that 3 quarters of a number is found by multiplying the number by 3 and then dividing it by 4.

X * 3 / 4 = 9

Step 4: Multiply X by 3: X * 3

Step 5: Divide the result by 4: (X * 3) / 4

Step 7: To find the value of X, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.

Step 8: First, we'll need to eliminate the fractions. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get rid of the denominator.

X * 3 = 9 * 4

Step 9: Next, we can distribute the 4 on the right side of the equation.

X * 3 = 36

Step 10: Now, we need to isolate X. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.

X = 36 / 3

Step 11: Simplify the right side of the equation: X = 12

Step 12: The final answer is: Regina has written 12 novels this year.</s>","Number of novels she wrote last year = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year

                 [/INST] To find the percentage of distance Michael has covered after traveling for 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we first need to calculate how far he has traveled during this time.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Michael has traveled in 3 days.

Given:
Average speed = 50 km/hr
Time = 3 days

We know that distance = speed × time.

So,
Distance = 50 km/hr × 3 days

Distance = 1500 km

Step 2: Find the percentage of total distance covered.

Given:
Total distance between Alaska and Texas = 6000 km

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) × 100%

So,
Percentage covered = (1500 km / 6000 km) × 100%

Percentage covered = (1 / 4) × 100%

Percentage covered ≈ 25%

Therefore, Michael has covered approximately 25% of the total distance between Alaska and Texas after traveling for 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/hr.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Madeline ate 0.6 times as many grapes as her brother needed for making grape juice. Let's find out how many grapes her brother used:
   If Madeline ate 0.6 times as many grapes as her brother, then her brother had x grapes. We want to find out how many grapes were used to make a full glass of juice for both of them:
   The total number of grapes = Madeline's share + Brother's share
   Madeline's share = 0.6 * Brother's share
   Since there is a full glass of grape juice for both, the total number of grapes should be enough to make a full glass for both:
   Total number of grapes = 2 * (Full glass)
   We know that Madeline ate 0.6 * Brother's grapes and the remaining grapes were enough to make 4 pies, so the total number of grapes is:
   Total number of grapes = (0.6 * Brother's grapes) + (12 * 4)

2. Solve for Brother's grapes:
   Total number of grapes = (0.6 * x) + (12 * 4)
   Simplify the equation:
   0.6x + 48 = 2G (where G is the number of grapes needed to make a full glass)

3. Find the number of grapes needed for a full glass:
   To find this value, we need to know the conversion rate from grapes to juice, which is missing in the problem statement. So, we cannot calculate the number of grapes needed to make a full glass.

However, we can still determine the number of grapes there were at the beginning based on the information provided.

4. Given that there were enough grapes to make a full glass for both Madeline and her brother, and 4 pies, we can find the minimum number of grapes needed to make these:
   Grapes for the full glass = 2 * (Full glass) (Since it was enough for both)
   Grapes for the pies = 12 * 4 (Since each pie requires 12 grapes)

5. To find the minimum number of grapes required to make a full glass and 4 pies, we can add the number of grapes for the full glass to the number of grapes for the 4 pies:
   Minimum number of grapes = Grapes for the full glass + Grapes for 4 pies
   Minimum number of grapes = 2 * (Full glass) + 12 * 4

{The final answer is the expression 2 * (Full glass) + 12 * 4, which represents the minimum number of grapes required to make a full glass of grape juice for both Madeline and her brother and 4 pies.}

Unfortunately, we were unable to find the value of a full glass of grape juice in the provided information, so we could not find the exact number of grapes at the beginning.</s>","Madeline's brother used 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 grapes

1. The cost of a box of pasta is $1.00. Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we can calculate the weekly cost of pasta as:

Weekly cost of pasta = Cost per box
= $1.00

2. Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese per week.

3. He spends twice that amount on gruyere cheese, so:

Weekly cost of gruyere cheese = 2 * Weekly cost of cheddar cheese
= 2 * $3.00
= $6.00

4. To find the total weekly cost of making macaroni and cheese, we add the costs of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese:

Weekly cost of macaroni and cheese = Weekly cost of pasta + Weekly cost of cheddar cheese + Weekly cost of gruyere cheese
= $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00
= $10.00

5. To find the annual cost, multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year, which is 52:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes spent cleaning classrooms.
Total number of classrooms = 80
Time spent cleaning each classroom = 15 minutes

Total minutes spent cleaning = Number of classrooms × Time spent cleaning each classroom
Total minutes spent cleaning = 80 × 15 = 1200 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of minutes spent working in a day.
Working hours per day = 8 hours
Minutes per hour = 60 minutes

Total minutes spent working per day = Working hours per day × Minutes per hour
Total minutes spent working per day = 8 hours × 60 minutes = 480 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of time spent cleaning classrooms on average per day.

Percentage of time spent cleaning classrooms = (Total minutes spent cleaning / Total minutes spent working per day) × 100%

Percentage of time spent cleaning classrooms = (1200 minutes / 480 minutes) × 100%

Using a calculator:

Percentage of time spent cleaning classrooms = 0.25 × 100% = 25%

If she has . 110 ? books, ? how many bookcases does ; she need to hold all of them?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the capacity of each shelf on one bookcase.
- Middle shelves: Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- Bottom shelf: The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. So, the bottom shelf can hold 10 * 2 = 20 books.
- Top shelf: The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. So, the top shelf can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Step 2: Calculate how many books can be stored on one bookcase.
- Each bookcase has three types of shelves: middle, bottom, and top. So, the total capacity of one bookcase is Middle shelves capacity (per shelf) * Number of middle shelves + Bottom shelf capacity * 1 + Top shelf capacity * 1
- Total capacity = 10 * (number of middle shelves) + 20 * 1 + 15 * 1

Step 3: Determine how many bookcases Elly needs to hold all her books.
- Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we need to figure out how many bookcases can hold 110 books.
- We can calculate this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase, and rounding up if there's a remainder.

Step 4: The final answer is:
- To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / (10 * (number of middle shelves) + 20 + 15). We need to find the integer value of number of middle shelves that satisfies this equation.
- By trial and error, we find that number of middle shelves = 5 satisfies the equation: 110 / (10 * 5 + 20 + 15) = 7 (rounded down. However, since there's a remainder of 3 books, she needs an additional bookcase).

So, Elly needs a total of 3 bookcases to store all her 110 books. {The final answer is: Elly needs 3 bookcases.}</s>","The bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.
The 2 middle shelves can hold a total of 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.
The top shelf can hold 20 – 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 books.
Each bookcase can hold a total of 20 books + 20 books + 15 books = <<20+20+15=55>>55 books.
To hold all of her books, she needs 110 / 55 = <<110/55=2>>2 bookcases.

                 [/INST] To find Rose's profit, we first need to determine the cost of the eggs she bought and the selling price of each egg.

1. The price Rose paid for 5 dozens (60 eggs) of eggs is $2.40. So, the cost per dozen is: $2.40 ÷ 5 = $0.48.

2. Rose will sell each egg for $1. So, her profit per egg is: $1.00 (selling price) - $0.48 (cost price) = $0.52.

3. To find the number of eggs she sold to determine her total profit, we need to find out how many eggs 3 dozen eggs are. We know that 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, so 3 dozens is 3 × 12 = 36 eggs.

4. To find Rose's total profit, we multiply the profit per egg by the number of eggs she sold: $0.52 ÷ egg profit × 36 eggs = $19.04.

{The final answer is $19.04}</s>","Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.
Five dozens of eggs is equal to 12 x 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 eggs.
So there are 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 sets of 3 eggs that Rose will sell.
Thus, the total earnings of Rose for selling the eggs are $1 x 20 = $<<20=20>>20.

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many hats of each color Skyler has. We know that he has 100 hats in total.

1. Half of the hats are red, so there are 100 * 0.5 = <<100*0.5=50>>50 red hats.

Now, we have 100 total hats, and we've found that 50 of them are red. So, there are 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50 remaining hats.

2. 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so there are 50 * 3/5 = <<50*3/5=30>>30 blue hats.

Since we know the number of red and blue hats, and there are only red, blue, and white hats, we can find the number of white hats by substracting the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, a total of 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30 hats

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of one stick of jerky without the discount.
The cost of one bag is $18.00, and it contains 30 sticks. So, the cost of one stick is:

Cost of one stick = Cost of one bag / Number of sticks in one bag = $18.00 / 30 sticks

Cost of one stick = $0.60

Step 2: Calculate the discount price of one bag.
The discount is $3.00 per bag. So, the cost of one bag on sale is:

Cost of one bag on sale = Cost of one bag - Discount = $18.00 - $3.00

Cost of one bag on sale = $15.00

Step 3: Calculate the cost of one stick of jerky on sale.
The number of sticks in a bag remains the same, so we can find the cost of one stick with the discount by dividing the cost of one bag on sale by the number of sticks:

Cost of one stick on sale = Cost of one bag on sale / Number of sticks in one bag = $15.00 / 30 sticks

Cost of one stick on sale = $0.50

Step 4: Convert the cost of one stick on sale to cents.
To find the cost of one stick in cents, we multiply by 100:

Cost of one stick on sale in cents = $0.50 * 100 = $50

{The final answer is: Each stick of jerky costs $0.05 cents with the discount.}</s>","The bags are $18.00 with a $3.00 coupon so each bag is 18-3 = $<<18-3=15.00>>15.00

1. Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade.
2. The first test has 70 questions, and she answered 60% of them correctly.
3. So, on the first test, she answered 0.6 * 70 = <<0.6*70=42>>42 questions correctly.
4. We don't know how many questions are in the second test. Let's call the number of questions in the second test ""x"".

{The final answer is the number she needs to answer correctly on the second test, which is 0.7 * (70 + x) - 42.}

For example, if the second test has 50 questions, then the total number of questions is 120 (70 from the first test + 50 from the second test), and Audrey needs to answer 84 questions correctly in total. So, the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test is 84 - 42 = <<84-42=42>>42.

She : makes some strawberry cubes, and . a number of ! blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number . of ! strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes , 116 ice cubes total, how many blueberry cubes does , she make?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as x. According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4. The total number of ice cubes is 116. Therefore, we have the following equation:

x (strawberry cubes) + (5x - 4) (blueberry cubes) = 116

Our goal is to find the number of blueberry cubes, which is equivalent to finding the value of the expression (5x - 4) when x is the number of strawberry cubes.

First, let's find x. We know that x is the number of strawberry cubes, and there is no direct mention of how many strawberry cubes Mary makes in the problem. To find x, we can solve for x in the equation above.

x + 5x - 4 = 116
6x - 4 = 116
6x = 120
x = 20

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now, let's find the number of blueberry cubes by using the expression (5x - 4) with x = 20.

Blueberry cubes = 5x - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 96 - 4 = 92

Therefore, {Mary makes 92 blueberry cubes}.</s>","Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.
Substituting the first equation into the second, we get s + 5s - 4 = 116.
Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116
Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120
Dividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20
Substituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96

Ara has played 40 games every year for the past 4 years.

Step 2: Multiply the number of games in a year by the number of years to get the total number of games played:
Total number of games = Number of games per year * Number of years
Total number of games = 40 games/year * 4 years
Total number of games = 160 games

Step 3: Multiply the number of games played in a year by Ara's score per game to find the total number of points she scores in one year:
Points scored per year = Number of games per year * Points per game
Points scored per year = 40 games * 21 points
Points scored per year = 840 points

Step 4: Multiply the number of points scored per year by the number of years to find the total number of points Ara has scored:

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes John to solve all 6 sides of the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and then add them up.

1. The first side takes John 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take 2 * 5 = 10 minutes (twice the time of the first side).
   {So far, John has solved 3 sides, and the total time spent is 5 + 10 = 15 minutes}.
3. The last 2 sides each take half the time of the first side. Half of 5 minutes is 2.5 minutes.

To find how long it takes to solve one side (not just the first one), let's first figure out how long it takes to solve the last 2 sides. The last 2 sides take half the time of the first side, which is 2.5 minutes. To solve one side without any additional time, it should take 2.5 * 2 = 5 minutes.

Now, we know that the first side takes 5 minutes, so the total time John spends on solving all 6 sides is:

5 minutes (first side) + 10 minutes (second and third sides) + 5 minutes (last 2 sides) = 15 minutes + 5 minutes = 20 minutes

{The final answer is 20 minutes.}</s>","The second and third side each take 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes
So they take 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 minutes together
The last 2 sides take 5/2=<<5/2=2.5>>2.5 minutes
So they take 2.5*2=<<2.5*2=5>>5 minutes
So the total time is 5+20+5=<<5+20+5=30>>30 minutes

Step 2: We are also given that there were half as many helmets as footballs. Let's represent the number of footballs as F. Since there were half as many helmets as footballs, then F = 2H.

Step 3: We know that there were 20 helmets. We can use this information to find the number of footballs. From step 2, we have F = 2H, and we know H = 20.

Step 4: Substituting H = 20 into the equation F = 2H, we get F = 2 * 20 = 40.

Step 5: To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we can add the number of helmets, robots, and footballs.

Step 6: We have 20 helmets, H/2 robots, and 2H footballs. Since H = 20, we can calculate the number of robots as H/2 = 20/2 = 10.

- He spends 6 hours at work each day.
- It takes him 15 minutes to handle one call.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.

First, we need to convert 15 minutes to hours: 15 minutes * (1 hour / 60 minutes) = 0.25 hours

Now, we can calculate how many calls he handles per hour: 1 hour / 0.25 hours = 4 calls/hour

Step 2: Calculate the number of calls Tim handles in a week.
- He works for 5 days a week.
- In one week, there are 7 daystimes5 days = 5weekdays
- So, he handles calls for 5weekdays * 4calls/hour = 20calls/day * 5days/week = 100calls/week

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The usual drying time for one painting with the old varnish is 7 minutes.
2. With the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
3. Louise needs to apply a coat of varnish to 6 paintings.
4. The time it takes for the varnish to dry on one painting is increased by 5 minutes (12 minutes with the new varnish vs. 7 minutes with the old varnish).
5. To find the total time it would take to dry the varnish on 6 paintings with the old varnish, we can calculate: 7 minutes/painting × 6 paintings = 42 minutes.
6. With the new varnish, each painting takes 5 minutes longer to dry. So the time it would take to dry the varnish on one painting with the new varnish is 7 minutes + 5 minutes = 12 minutes.
7. To find the total time it would take to dry the varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish, we can calculate: 12 minutes/painting × 6 paintings = 72 minutes.
8. Finally, to find the difference in time between the two varnishes for 6 paintings, we can subtract the time it would take with the old varnish from the time it would take with the new varnish: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the water requirement for each type of plant.
4 plants need half a cup: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups per day
8 plants need 1 cup: 8 * 1 = 8 cups per day
The rest need a quarter of a cup: number of plants * 0.25 = x * 0.25

Step 2: Find the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water.
x * 0.25 = total number of plants with this requirement - 4 (the 4 that need half a cup are already included in the calculation)
x = (total number of plants - 4) / 0.5 (since 0.25 = 0.5 * 0.5)

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water needed.
Total water = water for 4 half-cup plants + water for 8 one-cup plants + water for x quarter-cup plants
Total water = 2 + 8 + x

The final answer is: Crista needs 10 + x cups of water every day for her plants.

We're given that half of the distance is on land and half is in water, so the length of each part is equal to half the total distance:

On land: d/2 = 200 yards
In water: d/2 = 200 yards

Next, we need to calculate how long it takes Phineas to cover each distance.

For the land part, we're given that Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so to cover a distance of 200 yards, he will take:

Time on land = Distance / Speed = 200 yards / 20 yards per minute = 10 minutes

For the water part, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so to cover a distance of 200 yards, he will take:

Time in water = Distance / Speed = 200 yards / 10 yards per minute = 20 minutes

Since the total distance is the same for both parts, and Phineas takes 10 minutes to cover one half, the total time it takes for him to return home is simply the sum of the time spent on land and in water:

Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 10 minutes + 20 minutes = {The final answer is 30 minutes}.</s>","Half of 200 yards is 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 yards.

- Cost of blouses: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
- Cost of skirts: 1 * $6.00 = $6.00
- Cost of pants: 2 * $8.00 = $16.00

Step 3: Find the weekly cost of dry-cleaning:
Weekly cost = Cost of blouses + Cost of skirt + Cost of pants = $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00

Step 4: Multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks to find the total cost for 5 weeks:
Total cost = Weekly cost * Number of weeks = $47.00 * 5 = $235.00

{The final answer is: Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.}</s>","The blouses cost $5.00 each to dry clean and she has 5 so that's 5*5 = $<<5*5=25.00>>25.00
The one skirt she has costs $6.00 to dry clean

                    John decides to take up an odd hobby of speed talking.  His normally speaking speed is 150 WPM.  After training his speed is 2.5 times ; faster than his starting speed.  How long , would it take him to speak 10 pages if ! each page has 450 words per page?
                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes John to speak 10 pages at his faster speaking speed, we first need to determine his new speaking speed.

John's starting speaking speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). His speaking speed has increased 2.5 times, so:

New speaking speed = Starting speaking speed * 2.5
New speaking speed = 150 WPM * 2.5
New speaking speed = 375 WPM

Next, we need to find out how long it takes John to speak one page at his new speaking speed. We know that each page has 450 words, so:

Time to speak one page = Number of words on one page / Speaking speed in WPM
Time to speak one page = 450 words / 375 WPM
Time to speak one page ≈ 1.2 words per second

Now, we can find out how long it takes John to speak 10 pages:

Time to speak 10 pages = Time to speak one page * Number of pages
Time to speak 10 pages ≈ 1.2 words per second * 10 pages

{The final answer is approximately 12.5 seconds to speak 10 pages.}</s>","He can speak 150*2.5=<<150*2.5=375>>375 words per minute
He wants to say 450*10=<<450*10=4500>>4500 words
So he can speak them in 4500/375=<<4500/375=12>>12 minutes

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of people on the second day. We know that on the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day (50 people). So, the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = <<50+20=70>>70 people.

Step 2: Find the number of people on the third day. We know that on the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day. So, the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = <<2*70=140>>140 people.

Step 3: Calculate the average number of people Conor saw each day during the rest of the week. We're given that the average number of people Conor saw each day was 60.

Step 4: Find the number of people on each day during the rest of the week, except for the first three days. Since the average number of people Conor saw each day was 60, we can find the number of people on each day by multiplying the average number of people by the number of days remaining in the week, minus the first three days. So, the number of people on the fourth day is 60 * (7 - 3) = 60 * 4 = <<60*4=240>>240 people. Similarly, the number of people on the fifth day is 60 * (6 - 3) = 60 * 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 people, and the number of people on the sixth day is 60 * (5 - 3) = 60 * 2 = <<60*2=120>>120 people.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week. The total number of people Conor saw that week is the sum of the number of people he saw on the first three days (50, 70, and 140), and the number of people he saw on the remaining three days (240, 180, and 120). So the total number of people is 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 + 180 + 120 = <<50+70+140+240+180+120=1220>>1,220.

For the remaining days of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people per day, for a total of 60 people/day * 4 days = <<60*4=240>>240 people

How many : pieces ? of popcorn ; does Garrett have . to eat?
                 [/INST] To find the total number of popcorn pieces Garrett has, we need to calculate the number of popcorn pieces popped during each 30-second interval and then add the popcorn pieces that popped after removing the pan from the heat.

1. First 30 seconds: 20 popcorn pieces popped.
2. Next 30 seconds: 3 * 20 = 60 popcorn pieces popped.
3. Next 30 seconds: 4 * number of popcorn pieces popped in the first 30 seconds (since the popping rate is four times the initial rate). Let x = the number of popcorn pieces popped in the first 30 seconds. Then, the number of popcorn pieces popped in the next 30 seconds is 4x.
4. Final 30 seconds: Half the number of popcorn pieces popped in the previous 30 seconds. This can be represented as 0.5 * 4x = 2x.
5. After removing the pan from the heat: A quarter of the number of popcorn pieces popped during the final 30 seconds (2x).

Combining the amounts, we have:
Total popcorn pieces = Popcorn pieces in first 30 seconds + Popcorn pieces in next 30 seconds + Popcorn pieces after removing pan from heat

Total popcorn pieces = x + 4x + 0.5x + 0.25 * 2x

Total popcorn pieces = x + 4x + 0.5x + 0.5x

Total popcorn pieces = 5x + 0.5x

Total popcorn pieces = 5.5x

Therefore, the initial number of popcorn pieces, x, that popped during the first 30 seconds can be found by solving the equation 5.5x = total popcorn pieces desired. Once x is known, the total number of popcorn pieces Garrett has is 5.5x.

For example, if we want to find out how many popcorn pieces Garrett ends up with after popping 100 popcorn pieces (x = 100), then:

5.5 * 100 = 550

{The final answer is: Garrett has 550 popcorn pieces to eat.}</s>","In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 kernels pop.
In the third 30 seconds, 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 kernels pop.
In the final 30 seconds, 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 40 / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 kernels pop.
Thus, Garrett has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = <<20+60+80+40+10=210>>210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of lemons required for 1 gallon of lemonade.
1 gallon of lemonade = 4 cups (since 1 gallon is equal to 16 cups, and 1 cup is used for lemon juice, 4 cups are used for water and ice, so 1 gallon is represented by 4 cups of lemonade)
1 cup of lemon juice = 6 lemons
So, to make 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim will need:

Lemons for 1 gallon = (Lemons for 1 cup) * (Cups in 1 gallon)
= 6 lemons * 4
= 24 lemons

Step 2: Determine the number of lemons needed to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
4 gallons of lemonade = 4 * 24 lemons = 96 lemons

Step 3: Calculate the number of lemons required for an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
An extra gallon = 1 gallon
Since the other gallons are represented by 24 lemons (from Step 1), the extra gallon should have twice as much lemon juice, i.e., 48 cups of lemon juice.

Lemons for 1 gallon = 24 lemons
Lemons for extra gallon = Lemons for 1 gallon * 2
= 24 lemons * 2
= 48 lemons

Therefore, the final answer is that Tim will need 144 lemons (96 + 48) to make 5 gallons of lemonade for the pool party. {The final answer is 144 lemons}.</s>","Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch
In addition, he will make 4 regular gallons of lemonade, which each need 1 cup juice so 4*1 = <<4*1=4>>4 cups total
All total he will need 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of juice
Each cup requires 6 lemons each and he needs 6 cups of juice so 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 lemons needed

Step 1: Calculate the daily food consumption for each type of dog.
- German Shepherd consumes 5 kg of dog food per day.
- Bulldog consumes 3 kg of dog food per day.

Step 2: Find the total daily food consumption for all dogs.
- Total daily food consumption = (number of German Shepherds * food consumption per German Shepherd) + (number of Bulldogs * food consumption per Bulldog)
- Total daily food consumption = (3 * 5) + (2 * 3)
- Total daily food consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg
- Total daily food consumption = 21 kg

Step 3: Calculate the total food consumption for a week.
- Total weekly food consumption = total daily food consumption * 7 days

2. We also know that there are 15 four-legged animals on the farm. Each four-legged animal has 4 legs. So, the number of legs that four-legged animals have in total is: 15 * 4 = <<15*4=60>>60 legs.
3. To find the total number of legs on the farm, we just add the number of legs from both two-legged and four-legged animals: 20 + 60 = <<20+60=80>>80 legs.

Then, we can find the number of pink candies since we know there are twice as many orange candies as red candies and half as many yellow candies as red candies.

Step 1: Find the number of red, orange, and yellow candies.

We know the bag has 232 candies, and there are 54 red candies. Therefore, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108. Since there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, there are 54/2 = 27 yellow candies.

Step 2: Determine the number of orange candies.

Given that there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, we have:

Orange candies = 2 * Red candies = 2 * 54 = 108

Step 3: Find the number of pink candies.

Since we know there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, and there are 27 yellow candies, there must be:

Red candies = 2 * Yellow candies = 2 * 27 = 54

Now that we have the number of red candies, we can find the number of pink candies since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies:

Orange candies = 2 * Red candies = 2 * 54 = 108
Pink candies = Orange candies - (Red candies + Yellow candies)
            = 108 - (54 + 27)

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the cost of each component:

1. First, let's find the cost of the cinema tickets. The family consists of parents (?), so the number of adult tickets bought is?, and there is 1 child.
   Cost of adult tickets = ? adults * $12
   Cost of child ticket = $8

2. Calculate the cost of the cinema tickets:
   Total cost of tickets = Cost of adult tickets + Cost of child ticket

                 [/INST] Here's the step-by-step solution for the problem:

1. First, we need to find the total weight of John's car, luggage, and his two children.

Total weight = weight of the car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + (2 * 75 pounds)
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1500 pounds

2. The problem states that the force needed to move the car is 1% of the weight. So, we can calculate the required force by multiplying the total weight by 1%.

Force required = total weight * 1%
Force required = 1500 pounds * 0.01
Force required = 15 pounds

{The final answer is 15 pounds.}</s>","His two children weigh 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 pounds
So the total weight of the car and everything is 1200+250+150=<<1200+250+150=1600>>1600 pounds
So he needs to generate 1600*.01=<<1600*.01=16>>16 pounds

                 [/INST]Step 1: Determine the perimeter of the rectangle fence.
The perimeter of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width. 

P = 2(20 feet) + 2(15 feet)
P = 40 feet + 30 feet
P = 70 feet

Step 2: Divide the total length needed by the width of one crepe-paper streamer to find out how many streamers are required.

Number of streamers = Total length / Width of one streamer

Assuming the width of one crepe-paper streamer is 1 inch or 1 foot, we would assume it's 1 foot for simplicity.

Number of streamers = 70 feet / 1 foot
Number of streamers ≈ 70

Since it's improbable that James would be able to buy a 71-foot long crepe paper, we'll need to purchase more than one roll and add the lengths of multiple rolls to reach 70 feet. Instead, we will calculate how many 20-foot long rolls can be purchased and use that as a minimum order.

Step 3: Find out how many 20-foot rolls are necessary.

Number of 20-foot rolls = Total length necessary / Width of one roll
Number of 20-foot rolls = 70 feet / 1 foot
Number of 20-foot rolls ≈ 70

However, since no supplier offers 70-foot long rolls, the closest option would be purchasing 6 rolls of 20-foot long crepe paper. This would provide us with slightly more than what's required - 120 feet in total.

Step 4: Calculate the actual feet of crepe paper James should buy.

Total feet of crepe paper = Number of rolls * Width of one roll
Total feet of crepe paper = 6 rolls * 20 feet
Total feet of crepe paper = 120 feet

The final answer is: James needs to buy 120 feet of crepe paper for his party.</s>","First figure out how much crepe paper James needs for the long sides. Since there are two long sides, multiple the side's length by 2: 20 feet * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 feet
Now do the same multiplication to find out how much crepe paper James needs for the short sides: 15 feet * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 feet
Now add the amounts for the short and long sides together to find the total amount of crepe paper needed: 40 feet + 30 feet = <<40+30=70>>70 feet

                 [/INST] Let X represent Emma's age. Since Mia is 16 years younger than Emma, her age (Y) can be represented as X - 16.

The problem states that Mia is currently 40 years old, so we have:

X - 16 = 40

To find the average of their ages (A), we can add their individual ages and divide by 2:

A = (X + Y) / 2

Substitute Y with X - 16:

A = (X + (X - 16)) / 2

Combine like terms:

A = (2X - 16) / 2

Now, let's find the value of X. We know that X represents Emma's age and X - 16 represents Mia's age, while they are currently 16 years apart. We also know that Mia is 40 years old, so we can set up the equation:

X - 16 = 40

Solve for X:

X = 40 + 16 = 56

Now, let's find the average of their ages:

A = (2X - 16) / 2

Plug the value of X back in:

A = (2(56) - 16) / 2

Simplify and calculate:

A = (112 - 16) / 2
A = 100 / 2
A = 50

So, {The final answer is 50. The average age of Mia and Emma is 50 years.}</s>","If Mia is 40 years old, Emma is 40+16 = <<40+16=56>>56 years old.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many good seashells Benny found. We know that Tom found 214 and Nancy found 432.

Step 2: Let's assume Benny found ""x"" number of good seashells. So the total number of good seashells they found together would be 214 (Tom's) + 432 (Nancy's) + x (Benny's).

Step 3: We also know that 67 seashells were cracked. So the total number of seashells they found and kept, including the cracked ones, is 214 (Tom's) + 432 (Nancy's) + x (Benny's) + 67 (cracked).

Step 4: Since we're only interested in the number of good seashells they found, we need to subtract the cracked ones from the total number of seashells they found. The total number of good seashells is then 214 (Tom's) + 432 (Nancy's) + x (Benny's) - 67 (cracked).

Step 5: To solve for ""x,"" we first find the total number of seashells they found together, including the cracked ones: 214 (Tom's) + 432 (Nancy's) + x = 616+""67"" = 683.

Step 6: Now we subtract the cracked shells from this total: 683 (total) - 67 (cracked) = 676.

Step 7: Lastly, we find the number of good seashells Benny found by subtracting Tom's and Nancy's good seashells from this total: 676 - 214 (Tom's good) - 432 (Nancy's good) = x (Benny's good).

Step 8: Solving for x, we get x = 676 - 214 - 432 = 676 - 646 = 130.

Cost of a 3-piece place setting = $6 (dinner plate) + $4 (salad plate) + $5 (bowl)
Cost of a 3-piece place setting = $15

Now, multiply the cost of a 3-piece place setting by the number of people to find the total cost.

                 [/INST] Let's go through this problem step by step:

1. We know that each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, the daily feed consumption for one pig is 4 pounds × 2 = 8 pounds.
2. Dexter has five pigs, so their combined daily feed consumption is 5 pigs × 8 pounds/pig = 40 pounds.
3. We are given that Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how long this amount of feed will last, we need to divide the total order by the daily feed consumption. So, the length of time for the feed to last is 300 pounds / 40 pounds/day = 7.5 days.
4. Since feed can't be ordered in half-days, Dexter will need to order an additional 40 pounds of feed to cover the remaining half-day of consumption.
5. The total amount of feed Dexter will need for a week (7 days) is 7 days × 40 pounds/day + the extra 40 pounds = 280 pounds.

{The final answer is: After a week, there will be 280 - 300 = -20 pounds of feed left.}

It seems like we have made an error in our calculations or the given information is incorrect, as the final answer shows a negative amount of feed remaining. Upon closer examination, it appears there might be a misunderstanding in how the numbers were provided to us, or perhaps there was a mistake in the problem statement itself. Therefore, it's recommended to double-check the given information with the problem's source to ensure accuracy.</s>","In a day, one pig consumes 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 pounds of feed.
In a day, five pigs consume 8 x 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 pounds.
In a week, five pigs consume 40 x 7 = <<40*7=280>>280 pounds.
So, there are 300 - 280 = <<300-280=20>>20 pounds of feed left.

                 [/INST] Step 1: The original number of children is 5.

Step 2: On the second street, each child is joined by another child, so the number of children doubles. So, the number of children after the second street is 5 * 2 = 10 children.

Step 3: On the third street, each child in the existing group is joined by another 2 children. Since there were previously 10 children, each one is joined by 2 new children. So, the number of children after the third street is 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 20 children.

Step 4: The original 5 children leave the group, so the number of children following the truck is now 20 - 5 = {15 children}. Therefore, the final answer is that there are 15 children following the ice cream truck.</s>","On the second street, each child is joined by another child so the group doubles to 5 children * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 children.

On the third street, each child is joined by 2 more so the group has tripled to 10 children * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 children.
After the initial children leave, the group now has 30 children – 5 original children = <<30-5=25>>25 children.

                 [/INST] To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has given out so far from the total number of meals she has.

Meals given out:
- Friday: 64 meals
- Saturday: 30 meals
- Sunday: 48 meals

Total meals given out = 64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday)
Total meals given out = 142 meals

Now, let's find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute:
Total meals to distribute = 1,360 meals
Meals given out = 142 meals

Number of meals left to distribute = Total meals to distribute - Meals given out
Number of meals left to distribute = 1,360 meals - 142 meals
Number of meals left to distribute = 1,218 meals

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 brothers in the family. one is 12 years old, and the other one is older. The older brother's age is not given directly, but we know that he is twice the age of the younger brother.
2. Let's denote the age of the older brother as X. Then, the age of the younger brother would be X/2.
3. We also know that there are 3 sisters in the family, and all of them are the same age, which is 16.
4. To find the total age of all siblings, we need to find the ages of both brothers and all 3 sisters.
5. The age of the younger brother is X/2, and the age of the older brother is X.
6. The age of all 3 sisters is 16.
7. To find the total age of all siblings, we can sum up the ages of both brothers and all 3 sisters.
8. Therefore, the total age of all siblings is X + X/2 + 3*(16).
9. Since we know that the older brother's age is twice that of the younger brother, we can write the equation X = 2*(X/2) + 12.
10. Solving this equation, we get X = 24.
11. Substituting X = 24 into the equation for the total age of all siblings, we get Total age = 24 + 24/2 + 3*(16).
12. Simplifying this expression, we get Total age = 24 + 12 + 48 = 76.

{The final answer is: The total age of all siblings is 76.}</s>","Three sisters are in total 3 * 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 years old.
The younger brother is only half the age of the older one, which leads us to the older brother being 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 years old.
So all family members in total are 48 + 12 + 24 = <<48+12+24=84>>84 years old.

1. Meditation: Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, 5 days a week. So, the total time she spends on meditation per week is:
   15 minutes/session * 2 sessions/day * 5 days/week = 30 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 150 minutes/week
2. Yoga: Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week. So, the total time she spends on yoga per week is:

Next, let's find the cost of the shoes with the 40% discount. We're given that the original price of the shoes is $40. With a 40% discount, the cost of the shoes is:

$40 (original price) x 0.6 (remainder after discount) = $24

So, the cost of a bathrobe = $100
The cost of what Lani bought = $30 (sunglasses) + $100*2 (bathrobes) = $230

Step 3: Find their combined spending.
Their combined spending = The cost of what Ellen bought + The cost of what Lani bought = $105 + $230 = $335

{The final answer is $335.}</s>","Ellen spent $100 + $5 = $<<100+5=105>>105.
Two bathrobes cost 2 x $100 = $<<2*100=200>>200.

Therefore, they spent $105 + $230 = $<<105+230=335>>335 in all.

Steps:
1. Find the cost of making 1 jar:
   - Passion fruit: 2.0 (pounds) * $6.0 (per pound) = $12.0
   - Jackfruit: 1.5 (pounds) * $8.0 (per pound) = $12.0
   - Honey: 2.0 (pounds) * $10.0 (per pound) = $20.0
   - Total cost: $12.0 (passion fruit) + $12.0 (jackfruit) + $20.0 (honey) = $44.0

2. Find the profit per jar:
   - Profit per jar: Selling price ($50.0) - Cost ($44.0) = $7.0

3. Calculate the profit from selling 10 jars:
   - Profit from selling 10 jars: $7.0 (profit per jar) * 10 (jars) = $70.0

{The final answer is $70.0}</s>","The cost of the passion fruit is 2*6=$<<2*6=12>>12

                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many cars Josh services in a week. He is open 5 days a week (Monday through Saturday) and services 3 cars a day, so:

Number of cars serviced in a week = 3 cars/day * 5 days/week = 15 cars/week

Next, we need to find out how many cars he services in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 10 days in 2 weeks:

Number of cars serviced in 2 weeks = 15 cars/week * 2 weeks = 30 cars

Finally, we can find out how much money Josh makes in 2 weeks by multiplying the number of cars he services by his hourly wage. We are not given information about how many hours a day Josh works or how long it takes him to service a car, so we cannot calculate his hourly wage directly. Instead, we can use his weekly income of $4 per car and assume that this is an hourly wage for simplicity. Therefore, we have:

Money made in 2 weeks = 30 cars * $4/car = $120

{The final answer is: $120}</s>","He runs 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 days a week

1. Randy starts with:
   - 9 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 sugar cookies

2. For his early day snack, Randy ate:
   - 1 oatmeal cookie
   - 1 chocolate chip cookie
   - 1 sugar cookie
   So, he consumed 3 cookies in total.

3. For lunch, Randy ate:
   - 2 oatmeal cookies

4. Randy gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends, so he has 3 fewer sugar cookies than before.

5. For dinner, Randy baked:
   - 4 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 4 sugar cookies

Now we calculate Randy's remaining cookies:

Oatmeal cookies:
Initial: 9
Eaten: 3 (early snack) + 2 (lunch) = 5
Newly baked: 4
Total: 9 (initial) + 5 (eaten) + 4 (newly baked) = 18

Chocolate chip cookies:
Initial: 4
Eaten: 1 (early snack)

3. Half of 12 is 6, so the buyer will pay $5 * 6 = $30 for the first half.
4. The other half is also 6 toys, so the buyer will pay $7 * 6 = $42 for the second half.
5. To find the total amount of money Matthew would earn, we add the amounts for the first and second halves: $30 + $42 = $<<30+42=72>>72. {The final answer is $72.} So, if Matthew agrees to this offer, he will earn a total of $72.</s>","Half of Matthew collection means 12 * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 toy soldiers.

Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day, so during a 14-day vacation, the dog will dig:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Step 2: calculating the number of holes filled in per day
Nate fills in 9 holes a day.

Step 3: calculating how long it takes for Nate to fill in all the holes he initially dug.
84 holes / 9 holes/day = approximately 9 days

Step 4: calculating how long it takes for Nate to fill in all the holes, taking into account the new holes his dog digs every night.
Every night, the dog digs 6 new holes, so every 9-day period when Nate manages to fill in all the old holes, a new cycle of 6 holes being dug begins. To find out how many cycles there are, we divide the total number of holes by the number of holes dug per cycle (the sum of the holes Nate fills in and the new holes his dog digs): 84 holes / (9 holes/day * 2 cycles/day) = 8.5 cycles, since a complete cycle lasts 9 days, we'd round up and take 9 cycles.

So, it takes Nate 9 cycles * 9 days/cycle = 81 days to fill in all the holes.

The final answer is that it takes Nate 81 days to fill in all the holes.</s>","First find the number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation: 14 days * 6 holes/day = <<14*6=84>>84 holes

Then divide the total number of holes by the daily decrease in the number of holes to find the number of days Nate spends filling in holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days

1. Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. In total, there were 16 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 14 (Petri dishes) = 37 items.
2. Igor accidentally gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he brought 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes instead.
3. He gathered 2 more than the requested number of Petri dishes, which means he brought 14 (requested) + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
4. Igor placed 16 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + 7 (beakers, initially planned to bring but not lost) + x (beakers Igor lost) = 37 (total) items on the lab bench.
5. Substituting the known values, the equation becomes 16 + 16 + 7 + x = 37. Simplifying it, 37 = 35 + x.
6. Solving for x, we have x = 37 - 35 = 2.

However, we made an error in our initial calculation! The equation should have looked like 16 + 16 + 7 + x = 37, not 16 + 16 + 7 + x = 35. That being said, if we correct the equation, we get 16 + 16 + 7 + x = 37, and the simplified equation is x = 37 - 35 = 2.

{The final answer is: Igor lost 2 beakers.}</s>","On the lab bench, there were half of the requested number of test tubes, or 16/2=<<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.
On the lab bench, there were 14+2=<<14+2=16>>16 Petri dishes.
Since the remaining items on the bench were beakers, there were 29-8-16=<<29-8-16=5>>5 beakers on the lab bench.

                    question:
                    : The girls ! are trying to raise money for a carnival. Kim raises , $320 ! more than . Alexandra, who raises $430, and Maryam ? raises ? $400 more than ? Sarah, who raises $300. How much money, in . dollars, did they all ! raise in total?
                 [/INST] Let's call the amount of money Sarah raises $S, Maryam raises $M, Alexandra raises $A, and Kim raises $K.

From the problem statement, we have:

M > S + $300 (Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah)
A > K + $320 (Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra)

Our goal is to find the total amount of money they all raised. That is, we want to find the values of S, M, A, and K such that:

S + M + A + K = Total Amount

Since M > S + $300 and A > K + $320, we can write this system of inequalities as:

S + M > 4 * $300 (total amount Sarah and Maryam raised)
K + $320 < A (total amount Kim and Alexandra raised)

Now, let's find a relationship between the variables that satisfies the above inequalities. Since M > S + $300 and A > K + $320, we can combine these inequalities by letting M - S = x and A - K = y, where x > 300 and y > 320.

The total amount raised is S + M + A + K, so using these variable relationships, we have:

x + (x + 300) + y + (y - 320) = Total Amount

Combining terms:

2x + y - 300 < Total Amount

We don't have enough information to determine exact numerical values for x, y, or the total amount. However, we can determine that the total amount they raised is greater than 2x + y - 300.

To find x and y in terms of meaningful variables (like the difference in fundraising between each girl), we can write the equation in terms of the differences:

M - S = x => x = M - S
A - K = y => y = A - K

We know that Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so x = 400. And we know that Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so y = 320. Plugging these values back into our inequality, we get:

2(M - S) + (A - K) - 300 < Total Amount
2M - 2S + A - K < Total Amount

Now that we have our inequality in terms of S, M, A, and K, let's assume that all three girls raised at least $200, as a reasonable minimum. If any of them raised less than $200, then the other girls would have had to compensate for that, which would have made our analysis more complex without providing substantially more information.

With the minimum assumption, our inequality becomes:

2M - 2($200) + A - ($300) < Total Amount
2M + A < Total Amount + 1000
M + A > ($Total Amount + 1000) / 2

Thus, the total amount raised by the girls is greater than the expression M + A, which is more than ($Total Amount + 1000) / 2. {The final answer is: More than ($Total Amount + 1000) / 2 dollars}

This is an underdetermined problem because we don't have enough information to find unique numerical values for S, M, A, K, or the Total Amount. Nonetheless, we've established a lower bound for the total amount.

In summary, the girls raised more than ($Total Amount + 1000) / 2 dollars.</s>","Kim raises 320+430=<<320+430=750>>750 dollars.

Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron ? completed his part of the , race in 16 minutes, ; how long ! in ! minutes : did Vanessa take to complete her part?
                 [/INST] Let's assume that the distance of one leg of the relay race is a miles. Since Aaron can run twice as fast as Vanessa, we can represent Aaron's speed as 2 times Vanessa's speed. Thus, the time it takes for Aaron to run one mile is half the time it takes for Vanessa to run one mile. Hence, Aaron runs a mile in t minutes, and Vanessa runs a mile in 2t minutes.

According to the question, when Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since we know that Aaron runs a mile in t minutes, we can find the time it takes for Aaron to run 4 miles:

Aaron's time for 4 miles = 4 * t

Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles as well, we can calculate her time using the fact that she runs each mile twice as far as Aaron does:

Total distance for Vanessa = 4 miles * 2 (since she covers Aaron's and her own legs)

Vanessa's time for one mile = 2t minutes

Total time for Vanessa's 4 miles = 4 miles * 2t = 8mt

Since Aaron took 16 minutes to run 4 miles, we can find the time difference between their completion times:

Time difference = Aaron's time for 4 miles - Vanessa's time for 4 miles

Time difference = (4t) - 8t

Time difference = -4t

To find Vanessa's time for 4 miles, we'll subtract the time difference from Aaron's time:

Vanessa's time for 4 miles = Aaron's time for 4 miles + Time difference

Vanessa's time for 4 miles = 16 minutes - 4t

Note that since we don't have enough information to find the numerical value of 't,' we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. However, the final expression represents the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's times for a 4-mile leg of the relay race.

{The final answer is: Vanessa's time for 4 miles is 16 minutes - 4t minutes}</s>","Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 miles.
Aaron took 16 minutes, so he ran each mile in 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 minutes.

   Line required = Feet of dock * Line needed per foot
   = 200 feet * 3 feet/foot
   = 600 feet

2. Since the caretaker already has 6 lines of 3 feet each (or 18 feet in total), we can subtract this amount from the required length to find out how many more feet of line he needs to buy:
   Line to be bought = Line required - Line already owned

1. First, let's calculate the total cost of the 50 watermelons:
   The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.
   Cost price of one watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
   Cost price of one watermelon = $80 / 50
   Cost price of one watermelon = $1.6

2. Now, we need to find the selling price of each watermelon after a 25% profit:
   Let S be the selling price of one watermelon.
   Profit = S - Cost price
   Profit = 0.25 * Cost price
   S = Cost price + Profit
   S = Cost price + 0.25 * Cost price
   S = 1.25 * Cost price

3. Substitute the cost price calculated earlier into this formula:
   S = 1.25 * $1.6
   S = $2

Each watermelon was sold for $2.</s>","The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.

Step 3: James is twice as old as Dora, so Dora is James' half-sibling and was born when John was 19 + (15/2) = 24.5 years old. Since people cannot be exactly half a year old, we'll assume Dora was born when John was 25 years old.

1. Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
2. Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.

To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled after an hour, we need to calculate how many oranges they can peel in an hour and then compare the numbers.

First, let's find out how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour:

Ana's peeling rate = 1 orange / 3 minutes
Ana's hourly rate = 1 orange / 3 minutes * 60 minutes

Jane's peeling rate = 1 orange / 4 minutes
Jane's hourly rate = 1 orange / 4 minutes * 60 minutes

Now, let's compare their hourly rates to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled after an hour:

Difference in their hourly rates = Ana's hourly rate - Jane's hourly rate
Difference in their hourly rates = (1 orange / 3 minutes * 60 minutes) - (1 orange / 4 minutes * 60 minutes)

First, calculate their hourly rates:
Ana's hourly rate = 20 oranges/hour
Jane's hourly rate = 15 oranges/hour

Now, find the difference:
Difference = Ana's hourly rate - Jane's hourly rate = 5 oranges/hour

Hence, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour. We assumed there were 'x' oranges in the basket, but the answer doesn't depend on the number of oranges in the basket.

Step 2: He then goes to a junk shop and gets the radiator for 80% off its original price. To find the discounted price, we multiply the original price by (1 - discount rate), where the discount rate is expressed as a decimal:

discounted price = $400 * (1 - 0.8) = $400 * 0.2 = $800 * 0.2 = $160

So, Mark got the radiator for $160 from the junk shop.

Step 3: Mark then hires a mechanic to install the new radiator. The mechanic charges $50 an hour and it takes 3 hours to install, so Mark's total cost for labor is $50/hour * 3 hours = $150.

Step 4: To find the total amount that Mark paid for the new radiator and its installation, add the cost of the radiator and the labor:

1. We know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each.
2. Let's represent the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as K.
3. We have the equation: 2C + 4K = 70 (the total number of legs)
4. To simplify the equation, let's first get rid of the variables that we want to find by isolating one of them. We can isolate C by subtracting 2K from both sides: 2C = 70 - 4K
5. Now we need to solve this equation for C: C = (70 - 4K) / 2
6. However, we need to find a relationship between C and K that isn't as complicated. Let's find an integer solution by trial and error. We can start by assuming that all animals are cows. Then, 20 cows would have 20*4 = 80 legs, which is more than 70. So, we need to subtract some cows and add chickens instead. If we subtract 1 cow and add 2 chickens, we have 19 cows and 3 chickens, resulting in a total of 66 legs. We're still short of 70. By continuing this process, we find that adding 1 cow and subtracting 3 chickens results in a total of 70 legs, so we have 19 cows and 1 chicken more: 19 cows and 2 chickens.
7. Therefore, the final answer is: {There are 19 cows and 2 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm}.</s>","Let C be the number of chickens.
